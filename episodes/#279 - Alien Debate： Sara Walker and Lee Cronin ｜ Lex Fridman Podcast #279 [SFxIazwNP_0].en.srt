i'm completely biased at least as far as

i think right now we're the most
 

247
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,550
i think right now we're the most
interesting thing in the universe um so

248
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:16,560
interesting thing in the universe um so
 

249
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,629
interesting thing in the universe um so
i would expect um based on the intrinsic

curiosity that we have
 

253
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,469
curiosity that we have
and how much i think that's deeply

254
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:24,479
and how much i think that's deeply
 

255
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,550
and how much i think that's deeply

that other intelligent aliens would want
 

259
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,189
that other intelligent aliens would want
to seek out examples of the phenomena

260
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:31,199
to seek out examples of the phenomena
 

261
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,150
to seek out examples of the phenomena
they are

00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
they are
 

263
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,710
they are
to understand themselves better and i

264
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:34,720
to understand themselves better and i
 

265
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,550
to understand themselves better and i
think that's kind of a natural thing to

266
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
think that's kind of a natural thing to
 

267
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,150
think that's kind of a natural thing to
want to do and i don't think there's any

268
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,160
want to do and i don't think there's any
 

269
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,150
want to do and i don't think there's any
kind of judgment on

it being a lesser being or not it's like
 

273
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,430
it being a lesser being or not it's like
saying you have nothing to learn by

274
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
saying you have nothing to learn by
 

275
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,670

talking to a baby uh you have less to

276
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
talking to a baby uh you have less to
 

277
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,270
talking to a baby uh you have less to
learn probably more than you two talking

278
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,280
learn probably more than you two talking
 

279
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,909
learn probably more than you two talking
to somebody that's 90. so um

280
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919
to somebody that's 90. so um
 

281
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,430
to somebody that's 90. so um
yeah so i think they absolutely would so

282
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:51,440
yeah so i think they absolutely would so
 

283
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,430
yeah so i think they absolutely would so
whatever the phenomena is

284
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:53,440
whatever the phenomena is
 

285
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,270
whatever the phenomena is
that is human

286
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,280
that is human
 

287
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,870
that is human
there will be an inkling of the same

288
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:56,880
there will be an inkling of the same
 

289
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,550
there will be an inkling of the same
kind of phenomenal within alien species

290
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
kind of phenomenal within alien species
 

291
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,629
kind of phenomenal within alien species
and then we'll be seeking that same

292
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:00,639
and then we'll be seeking that same
 

293
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,990
and then we'll be seeking that same
i think there's got to be some features

294
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000
i think there's got to be some features
 

295
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,990
i think there's got to be some features
of us that are universal and i think the

296
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,000
of us that are universal and i think the
 

297
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,629
of us that are universal and i think the
ones that are most interesting and i

298
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:06,639
ones that are most interesting and i
 

299
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,550
ones that are most interesting and i
hope i live in an interesting universe

300
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:08,560
hope i live in an interesting universe
 

301
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,629
hope i live in an interesting universe
are the ones that

302
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
are the ones that
 

303
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,550
are the ones that
are driven by

00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560
are driven by
 

305
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,070
are driven by
our curiosity and the fact that

306
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080
our curiosity and the fact that
 

307
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,469
our curiosity and the fact that
our intelligence allows us to do things

308
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:18,479
our intelligence allows us to do things
 

309
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,830
our intelligence allows us to do things
that the universe wouldn't be able to do

310
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:19,840
that the universe wouldn't be able to do
 

311
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,629
that the universe wouldn't be able to do
without things like us existing

312
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639
without things like us existing
 

313
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,310
without things like us existing
we're going to define a lot of terms one

314
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:24,320
we're going to define a lot of terms one
 

315
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,710
we're going to define a lot of terms one
of them is interesting yes

316
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:26,720
of them is interesting yes
 

317
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,469
of them is interesting yes
that's very interesting term to try to

318
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479
that's very interesting term to try to
 

319
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,710
that's very interesting term to try to
define uh lee what what do you think are

320
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720
define uh lee what what do you think are
 

321
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,350

well let's take it from our perspective

324
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:34,639
well let's take it from our perspective
 

325
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,230
well let's take it from our perspective
we want to go find aliens as a species

326
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,240
we want to go find aliens as a species
 

327
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,590
we want to go find aliens as a species
quite desperately

328
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600
quite desperately
 

329
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,469
quite desperately
so

330
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:38,479
so
 

331
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,670
so
if we put the shoe on the other foot of

332
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:39,680
if we put the shoe on the other foot of
 

333
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,189
if we put the shoe on the other foot of
course we're interesting

334
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199
course we're interesting
 

335
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,029
course we're interesting
but i'm wondering

336
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:43,039
but i'm wondering
 

337
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,870
but i'm wondering
um and assuming that we're at the right

338
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:44,880
um and assuming that we're at the right
 

339
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,550
um and assuming that we're at the right
technological capability to go searching

340
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
technological capability to go searching
 

341
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,749
technological capability to go searching
for aliens

342
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:47,759
for aliens
 

343
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,590
for aliens
then that's interesting so what i mean

344
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:49,600
then that's interesting so what i mean
 

345
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,390
then that's interesting so what i mean
is

346
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
is
 

347
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,150
is
if there needs to be a massive leap in

348
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,160
if there needs to be a massive leap in
 

349
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,590
if there needs to be a massive leap in
technology that we don't have

350
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:55,600
technology that we don't have
 

351
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,510
technology that we don't have
how will aliens prioritize coming to

352
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
how will aliens prioritize coming to
 

353
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,790
how will aliens prioritize coming to
earth and other places but i i do think

354
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:00,800
earth and other places but i i do think
 

355
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,469
earth and other places but i i do think
that they would come and find us because

356
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:02,479
that they would come and find us because
 

357
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,790
that they would come and find us because
they want to find out about our culture

358
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:04,800
they want to find out about our culture
 

359
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,710
they want to find out about our culture
what things are universal it what about

360
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
what things are universal it what about
 

361
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,150
what things are universal it what about
i mean i'm a chemist i would say well is

362
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
i mean i'm a chemist i would say well is
 

363
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,070
i mean i'm a chemist i would say well is
the chemistry universal right

364
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080
the chemistry universal right
 

365
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,270
the chemistry universal right
are the creatures that we're going to

366
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,280
are the creatures that we're going to
 

367
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,590
are the creatures that we're going to
find making all this commotion

368
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:13,600
find making all this commotion
 

369
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,990
find making all this commotion
are they made of the same stuff

370
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,000
are they made of the same stuff
 

371
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,350
are they made of the same stuff
um

372
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,360
um
 

373
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,469
um
what does their science look like um are

374
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
what does their science look like um are
 

375
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,189
what does their science look like um are
they off planet yet um i guess there's

376
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
they off planet yet um i guess there's
 

377
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,070
they off planet yet um i guess there's
so i i think that neil degrasse tyson is

378
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,080
so i i think that neil degrasse tyson is
 

379
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,990
so i i think that neil degrasse tyson is
being slightly pessimistic and maybe

380
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,000
being slightly pessimistic and maybe
 

381
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,909
being slightly pessimistic and maybe
trying to play

382
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:29,919
trying to play
 

383
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:30,950
trying to play
the

384
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:30,960
the
 

385
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,909
the
tune that the universe is vast and it's

386
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:33,919
tune that the universe is vast and it's
 

387
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,070
tune that the universe is vast and it's
not worth them coming here i don't think

388
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,080
not worth them coming here i don't think
 

389
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,350
not worth them coming here i don't think
that

390
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,360
that
 

391
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,590
that
but i just worry that maybe we we don't

392
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:39,600
but i just worry that maybe we we don't
 

393
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,950
but i just worry that maybe we we don't
have the ability to talk to them we

394
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:40,960
have the ability to talk to them we
 

395
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,469
have the ability to talk to them we
don't have the universal translator we

396
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:42,479
don't have the universal translator we
 

397
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,390
don't have the universal translator we
don't have the right physics but sure

398
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,400
don't have the right physics but sure
 

399
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,230
don't have the right physics but sure
they should come we are interesting i

400
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,240
they should come we are interesting i
 

401
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,830
they should come we are interesting i
want to know if they exist it would make

402
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:47,840
want to know if they exist it would make
 

403
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,040
want to know if they exist it would make
it easier if they just came

404
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,050
it easier if they just came
 

405
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,710
it easier if they just came
[Laughter]

406
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:50,720
[Laughter]
 

407

sarah tweeted
 

413
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,390
sarah tweeted
uh thinking about aliens thinking about

414
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,400
uh thinking about aliens thinking about
 

415
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,670

aliens
so

418
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:03,199
so
 

419
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,629
so
how much do you think aliens are

420
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
how much do you think aliens are
 

421
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,710
how much do you think aliens are
thinking about other aliens including

422
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:06,720
thinking about other aliens including
 

423
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,950
thinking about other aliens including
humans so you said we humans want

424
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:10,960
humans so you said we humans want

like we're longing to connect with
 

429
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,550

aliens why is that can you introspect
 

431
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,990
aliens why is that can you introspect
that is that an obvious thing that we

432
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,000
that is that an obvious thing that we
 

433
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,430
that is that an obvious thing that we
should be like what are we hoping to

434
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,440
should be like what are we hoping to
 

435
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,710
should be like what are we hoping to
understand

436
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:20,720
understand
 

437
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,390
understand
by meeting aliens

438
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,400
by meeting aliens
 

439
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,510
by meeting aliens
exactly

440
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,520
exactly
 

441
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,670
exactly

00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,000
saw sarah put that tweet i think i
 

451
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,670
saw sarah put that tweet i think i
answered it actually as well which was

452
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
answered it actually as well which was
 

453
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,629
answered it actually as well which was
uh

454
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:36,639
uh
 

455
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,230
uh
we are thinking about trying to make

456
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,240
we are thinking about trying to make
 

457
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,309
we are thinking about trying to make
contact so they almost certain are

458
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:40,319
contact so they almost certain are
 

459
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,110
contact so they almost certain are
certain

460
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,120
certain
 

461
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,790
certain
certainly are but maybe there's a number

462
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:42,800
certainly are but maybe there's a number
 

463
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,189
certainly are but maybe there's a number
of classes there are the those aliens

464
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:45,199
of classes there are the those aliens
 

465
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,790
of classes there are the those aliens
that have not yet made contact with

466
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:46,800
that have not yet made contact with
 

467
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,869
that have not yet made contact with
other aliens like us

468
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:48,879
other aliens like us
 

469
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,790
other aliens like us
those aliens have made contact with just

470
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:50,800
those aliens have made contact with just
 

471
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,230
those aliens have made contact with just
one other alien and maybe it's an

472
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,240
one other alien and maybe it's an
 

473
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,070
one other alien and maybe it's an
anti-climax and slime

474
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,080
anti-climax and slime
 

475
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,909
anti-climax and slime
all right and aliens that have made

476
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:55,919
all right and aliens that have made
 

477
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,670
all right and aliens that have made
contact with not just one set of

478
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
contact with not just one set of
 

479
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,830
contact with not just one set of
intelligent species but several that

480
00:07:59,830 --> 00:07:59,840
intelligent species but several that
 

481
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,749
intelligent species but several that
must be amazing actually literally there

482
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:01,759
must be amazing actually literally there
 

483
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,589
must be amazing actually literally there
is some place in the universe there must

484
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:03,599
is some place in the universe there must
 

485
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,270
is some place in the universe there must
be one alien civilization to not make

486
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,280
be one alien civilization to not make
 

487
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,029
be one alien civilization to not make
contact with not one

488
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
contact with not one
 

489
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,469
contact with not one
but two other intelligent civilizations

490
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:10,479
but two other intelligent civilizations
 

491
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,150
but two other intelligent civilizations
so they must be thinking about there

492
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,160
so they must be thinking about there
 

493
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,830
so they must be thinking about there
must be entire

494
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:13,840
must be entire
 

495
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,950
must be entire
um

496
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:14,960
um
 

497
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,950
um
degree courses on aliens thinking about

498
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:16,960
degree courses on aliens thinking about
 

499
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,749
degree courses on aliens thinking about
aliens and cultural uh universal

500
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:19,759
aliens and cultural uh universal
 

501
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,350
aliens and cultural uh universal
cultural norms

502
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:21,360
cultural norms
 

503
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,710
cultural norms
do you think they will survive the

504
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:22,720
do you think they will survive the
 

505
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,390
do you think they will survive the
meeting

506
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,400
meeting
 

507
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,469
meeting
and by the way lee did respond saying

508
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:26,479
and by the way lee did respond saying
 

509
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,029
and by the way lee did respond saying
that's all the universe wants so sarah

510
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:29,039
that's all the universe wants so sarah
 

511
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,550
that's all the universe wants so sarah
said thinking about aliens thinking

512
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:30,560
said thinking about aliens thinking
 

513
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,830
said thinking about aliens thinking
about aliens

514
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:31,840
about aliens
 

515
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,310
about aliens
they said that's all the universe wants

516
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:34,320
they said that's all the universe wants
 

517
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,870
they said that's all the universe wants
and then sarah responded cheeky universe

518
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:36,880
and then sarah responded cheeky universe
 

519
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,550
and then sarah responded cheeky universe
we live in

520
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:38,560
we live in
 

521
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,269
we live in
so cheeky is a is a cheeky version of

522
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:41,279
so cheeky is a is a cheeky version of
 

523
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,790
so cheeky is a is a cheeky version of
the word interesting all of which will

524
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:42,800
the word interesting all of which will
 

525
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,149
the word interesting all of which will
try to define

526
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,159
try to define
 

527
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,829
try to define
uh mathematically he might be harder

528
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839
uh mathematically he might be harder
 

529
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,030
uh mathematically he might be harder
than interesting

530
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
than interesting
 

531
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,350
than interesting
because there's humor in that too yes

532
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,360
because there's humor in that too yes
 

533
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,550
because there's humor in that too yes
i think there's a mathematical

534
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:50,560
i think there's a mathematical
 

535
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,070
i think there's a mathematical
definition of humor but we'll talk about

536
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,080
definition of humor but we'll talk about
 

537
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,269
definition of humor but we'll talk about
that

538
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:53,279
that
 

539
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,550
that
yeah

540
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,560
yeah
 

541
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,829
yeah
so if you're

542
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:55,839
so if you're
 

543
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,230
so if you're
a graduate student alien looking at

544
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,240
a graduate student alien looking at
 

545
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,389
a graduate student alien looking at
multiple alien civilizations

546
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:00,399
multiple alien civilizations
 

547
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,670
multiple alien civilizations
uh do you think they survive the

548
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:01,680
uh do you think they survive the
 

549
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,430
uh do you think they survive the
encounters

550
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:03,440
encounters
 

551
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,630
encounters
i think there's a tendency to

552
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:04,640
i think there's a tendency to
 

553
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,269
i think there's a tendency to
anthropomorphize a lot of discussions

554
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:07,279
anthropomorphize a lot of discussions
 

555
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,509
anthropomorphize a lot of discussions
about alien life which is a really big

556
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:09,519
about alien life which is a really big
 

557
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,910
about alien life which is a really big
challenge so i usually when i'm trying

558
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:11,920
challenge so i usually when i'm trying
 

559
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,190
challenge so i usually when i'm trying
to think about these problems i don't

560
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,200
to think about these problems i don't
 

561
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,710
to think about these problems i don't
try to think about

562
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:14,720
try to think about
 

563
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,590
try to think about
um us as humans but us as an example of

564
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:17,600
um us as humans but us as an example of
 

565
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,030
um us as humans but us as an example of
phenomena that exists in the universe

566
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,040
phenomena that exists in the universe
 

567
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,630
phenomena that exists in the universe
that we have yet to explain

568
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:20,640
that we have yet to explain
 

569
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,230
that we have yet to explain
um and it doesn't seem to be the case

570
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,240
um and it doesn't seem to be the case
 

571
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,230
um and it doesn't seem to be the case
that if i think about

572
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:26,240
that if i think about
 

573
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,509
that if i think about
the features

574
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:27,519
the features
 

575
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,509
the features
i would argue are most universal about

576
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:29,519
i would argue are most universal about
 

577
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,190
i would argue are most universal about
that phenomena that there's any reason

578
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,200
that phenomena that there's any reason
 

579
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,790
that phenomena that there's any reason
to think that a first encounter with

580
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:32,800
to think that a first encounter with
 

581
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,150
to think that a first encounter with
another

582
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,160
another
 

583
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,829
another
lineage or

584
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:35,839
lineage or
 

585
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,509
lineage or
example of life would be antagonistic

586
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:39,519
example of life would be antagonistic
 

587
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,310
example of life would be antagonistic
um

588
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
um
 

589
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,670
um
i think

590
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:41,680
i think
 

591
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,910
i think
yeah and and i think there's this kind

592
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:43,920
yeah and and i think there's this kind
 

593
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,829
yeah and and i think there's this kind
of assumption

594
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:45,839
of assumption
 

595
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,269
of assumption
i mean going back to neil degrasse

596
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:47,279
i mean going back to neil degrasse
 

597
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,750
i mean going back to neil degrasse
tyson's uh quote i mean it kind of

598
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:49,760
tyson's uh quote i mean it kind of
 

599
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,430
tyson's uh quote i mean it kind of
bothers me because there's a i mean i'm

600
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:51,440
bothers me because there's a i mean i'm
 

601
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,190
bothers me because there's a i mean i'm
a physicist so i know we have a lot of

602
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,200
a physicist so i know we have a lot of
 

603
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,430
a physicist so i know we have a lot of
egos about how much we can describe the

604
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:55,440
egos about how much we can describe the
 

605
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,829
egos about how much we can describe the
world but that there's this like because

606
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:57,839
world but that there's this like because
 

607
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,350
world but that there's this like because
we understand fundamental physics so

608
00:09:59,350 --> 00:09:59,360
we understand fundamental physics so
 

609
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,870
we understand fundamental physics so
well we understand

610
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:00,880
well we understand
 

611
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,990
well we understand
alien life and we can kind of

612
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,000
alien life and we can kind of
 

613
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,509
alien life and we can kind of
extrapolate and i just think that we

614
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:03,519
extrapolate and i just think that we
 

615
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,310
extrapolate and i just think that we
don't um and the quest there is really

616
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,320
don't um and the quest there is really
 

617
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,550
don't um and the quest there is really
you know really to understand something

618
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:08,560
you know really to understand something
 

619
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,150
you know really to understand something
totally new about the universe and that

620
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,160
totally new about the universe and that
 

621
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,230
totally new about the universe and that
thing just happens to be us i agree i

622
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:12,240
thing just happens to be us i agree i
 

623
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,350
thing just happens to be us i agree i
agree there's something else more

624
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:13,360
agree there's something else more
 

625
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,110
agree there's something else more
profound i think neil is just being

626
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,120
profound i think neil is just being
 

627
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,750
profound i think neil is just being
again he's just trying to stir the pot

628
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:17,760
again he's just trying to stir the pot
 

629
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,509
again he's just trying to stir the pot
i would say from a

630
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:19,519
i would say from a
 

631
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,509
i would say from a
from a contingency point of view i want

632
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:21,519
from a contingency point of view i want
 

633
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,350
from a contingency point of view i want
to know how many ways does the universe

634
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:23,360
to know how many ways does the universe
 

635
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,829
to know how many ways does the universe
build structures build memories right

636
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:25,839
build structures build memories right
 

637
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,670
build structures build memories right
that and then

638
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:27,680
that and then
 

639
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,190
that and then
i want to know if those memories can

640
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,200
i want to know if those memories can
 

641
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,470
i want to know if those memories can
interact with each other and if you have

642
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,480
interact with each other and if you have
 

643
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,269
interact with each other and if you have
to

644
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
to
 

645
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,670
to
um different origins of life and then

646
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680
um different origins of life and then
 

647
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,949
um different origins of life and then
origins of intelligence and then these

648
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:34,959
origins of intelligence and then these
 

649
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,630
origins of intelligence and then these
things become conscious

650
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:36,640
things become conscious
 

651
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,829
things become conscious
surely you want to go and talk to them

652
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:37,839
surely you want to go and talk to them
 

653
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,590
surely you want to go and talk to them
and figure out

654
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600
and figure out
 

655
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,990
and figure out
what commonalities you share and it

656
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,000
what commonalities you share and it
 

657
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,350
what commonalities you share and it
might be that we're just unable to

658
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:43,360
might be that we're just unable to
 

659
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,550
might be that we're just unable to
conceive of what they're going to look

660
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560
conceive of what they're going to look
 

661
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,750
conceive of what they're going to look
like they're just going to be completely

662
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:45,760
like they're just going to be completely
 

663
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,310
like they're just going to be completely
different you know infrastructure

664
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:48,320
different you know infrastructure
 

665
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,910
different you know infrastructure
but surely we'll want to go and find out

666
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:49,920
but surely we'll want to go and find out
 

667
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,310
but surely we'll want to go and find out
a map and surely curiosity is a property

668
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:52,320
a map and surely curiosity is a property
 

669
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,509
a map and surely curiosity is a property
that evolution has made on earth and i

670
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
that evolution has made on earth and i
 

671
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,430
that evolution has made on earth and i
can't see any reason that it won't

672
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:57,440
can't see any reason that it won't
 

673
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,430
can't see any reason that it won't
happen elsewhere because curiosity

674
00:10:59,430 --> 00:10:59,440
happen elsewhere because curiosity
 

675
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,230
happen elsewhere because curiosity
probably exists because we want to find

676
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:02,240
probably exists because we want to find
 

677
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,829
probably exists because we want to find
innovations in the environment we want

678
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
innovations in the environment we want
 

679
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,949
innovations in the environment we want
to use that information to help

680
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:06,959
to use that information to help
 

681
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,550
to use that information to help
our technology

682
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:08,560
our technology
 

683
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,310
our technology
and also curiosity is like planning for

684
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:10,320
and also curiosity is like planning for
 

685
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,990
and also curiosity is like planning for
the future are they going to fight us

686
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,000
the future are they going to fight us
 

687
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,829
the future are they going to fight us
are they are we going to be able to

688
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:13,839
are they are we going to be able to
 

689
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,110
are they are we going to be able to
trade with them

690
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,120
trade with them
 

691
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,949
trade with them
so i think that neil's just i don't know

692
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:16,959
so i think that neil's just i don't know
 

693
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:17,990
so i think that neil's just i don't know
maybe

694
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
maybe
 

695
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,430
maybe
you know i mean give a that's

696
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440
you know i mean give a that's
 

697
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,350
you know i mean give a that's
really i think that's really down on

698
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,360
really i think that's really down on
 

699
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,470
really i think that's really down on
earth right

700
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:22,480
earth right
 

701
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,230
earth right
how would aliens categorize humans do

702
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,240
how would aliens categorize humans do
 

703
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,990
how would aliens categorize humans do
you think

704
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,000
you think
 

705
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,430
you think
how would weak so let's put the other

706
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:27,440
how would weak so let's put the other
 

707
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,990
how would weak so let's put the other
way around slime category maybe no no no

708
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,000
way around slime category maybe no no no
 

709
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,470
way around slime category maybe no no no
we maybe we could the thing is a bit odd

710
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,480
we maybe we could the thing is a bit odd
 

711
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,630
we maybe we could the thing is a bit odd
right look at instagram

712
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:34,640
right look at instagram
 

713
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,710
right look at instagram
twitter all these people taking selfies

twitter all these people taking selfies
 

715
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,310
twitter all these people taking selfies
i mean does the universe

716
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,320
i mean does the universe
 

717
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,710
i mean does the universe
is the ultimate state of consciousness

718
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:40,720
is the ultimate state of consciousness
 

719
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,389
is the ultimate state of consciousness
thinking beings that take photographs

720
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:42,399
thinking beings that take photographs
 

721
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,670
thinking beings that take photographs
themselves and upload them to an

722
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
themselves and upload them to an
 

723
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,190
themselves and upload them to an
interweb with other thinking beings

724
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:45,200
interweb with other thinking beings
 

725
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,750
interweb with other thinking beings
looking at each other's photos so

726
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:47,760
looking at each other's photos so
 

727
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,910
looking at each other's photos so
um i think that they will be wrong with

728
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:49,920
um i think that they will be wrong with
 

729
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,949
um i think that they will be wrong with
that

730
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:50,959
that
 

731
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:51,750
that
yeah

732
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:51,760
yeah
 

733
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,030
yeah
i did not say there was anything wrong

734
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,040
i did not say there was anything wrong
 

735
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,670
i did not say there was anything wrong
with it consciousness manifested at

736
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:55,680
with it consciousness manifested at
 

737
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,389
with it consciousness manifested at
scale

738
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:56,399
scale
 

739
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,550
scale
yeah selfies yeah instagram like the

740
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:58,560
yeah selfies yeah instagram like the
 

741
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,790
yeah selfies yeah instagram like the
mirror test at scale yeah i do think

742
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:00,800
mirror test at scale yeah i do think
 

743
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,470
mirror test at scale yeah i do think
that curiosity

744
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:02,480
that curiosity
 

745
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,629
that curiosity
is really the driving force why we have

746
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:04,639
is really the driving force why we have
 

747
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,310
is really the driving force why we have
our technology right if we weren't

748
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:06,320
our technology right if we weren't
 

749
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,389
our technology right if we weren't
curious we wouldn't go out left the cave

750
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:08,399
curious we wouldn't go out left the cave
 

751
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,590
curious we wouldn't go out left the cave
so i think that um

752
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:11,600
so i think that um
 

753
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,430
so i think that um
so i think that neil's got it completely

754
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:13,440
so i think that neil's got it completely
 

755
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,190
so i think that neil's got it completely
wrong in fact actually of course they'd

756
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:15,200
wrong in fact actually of course they'd
 

757
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,949
wrong in fact actually of course they'd
want to come here it doesn't mean they

758
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:16,959
want to come here it doesn't mean they
 

759
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,710
want to come here it doesn't mean they
are coming here we've seen evidence for

760
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:18,720
are coming here we've seen evidence for
 

761
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,110
are coming here we've seen evidence for
that i guess we can argue about that

762
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,120
that i guess we can argue about that
 

763
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,910
that i guess we can argue about that
right

764
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:21,920
right
 

765
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,069
right
but i think that um we want i

766
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:24,079
but i think that um we want i
 

767
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,829
but i think that um we want i
desperately and i know that sarah does

768
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:25,839
desperately and i know that sarah does
 

769
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,269
desperately and i know that sarah does
too but i won't speak for you you're

770
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:27,279
too but i won't speak for you you're
 

771
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,350
too but i won't speak for you you're
here you can i desperately want to have

772
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:29,360
here you can i desperately want to have
 

773
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,350
here you can i desperately want to have
missions to look for life in the solar

774
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:31,360
missions to look for life in the solar
 

775
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,509
missions to look for life in the solar
system right now i want to map life over

776
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:33,519
system right now i want to map life over
 

777
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,269
system right now i want to map life over
the solar system and then i want to

778
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:35,279
the solar system and then i want to
 

779
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,870
the solar system and then i want to
understand how we can go and find life

780
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:36,880
understand how we can go and find life
 

781
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,790
understand how we can go and find life
as quickly as possible at the nearest

782
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:38,800
as quickly as possible at the nearest
 

783
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,750
as quickly as possible at the nearest
stars

784
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:39,760
stars
 

785
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,269
stars
and also at the same time do it in the

786
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:41,279
and also at the same time do it in the
 

787
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,110
and also at the same time do it in the
lab just to compensate

788
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,120
lab just to compensate
 

789
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,310
lab just to compensate
you know

790
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,320
you know
 

791
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,509
you know
so sure

792
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:45,519
so sure
 

793
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,509
so sure
yeah just one more point on this if you

794
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:47,519
yeah just one more point on this if you
 

795
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,750
yeah just one more point on this if you
think about sort of what's driven

796
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:49,760
think about sort of what's driven
 

797
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,750
think about sort of what's driven
the most like features of our own

798
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:51,760
the most like features of our own
 

799
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,670
the most like features of our own
evolution as a species you could and try

800
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:53,680
evolution as a species you could and try
 

801
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,110
evolution as a species you could and try
to map that to alien species i always

802
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,120
to map that to alien species i always
 

803
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,470
to map that to alien species i always
think like optimism is what's going to

804
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:56,480
think like optimism is what's going to
 

805
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,030
think like optimism is what's going to
get us furthest and so i think a lot of

806
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,040
get us furthest and so i think a lot of
 

807
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,710
get us furthest and so i think a lot of
people always think that it's like war

808
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
people always think that it's like war
 

809
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,790
people always think that it's like war
and conflict is going to be the way that

810
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:02,800
and conflict is going to be the way that
 

811
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,310
and conflict is going to be the way that
alien species will

812
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,320
alien species will
 

813
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,629
alien species will
expand out into the cosmos but if you

814
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:06,639
expand out into the cosmos but if you
 

815
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,470
expand out into the cosmos but if you
just look at how we're doing it and how

816
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:08,480
just look at how we're doing it and how
 

817
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,230
just look at how we're doing it and how
we talk about it zoe's our future and

818
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,240
we talk about it zoe's our future and
 

819
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,670
we talk about it zoe's our future and
space is always

820
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:11,680
space is always
 

821
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,110
space is always
you know built from narratives of

822
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,120
you know built from narratives of
 

823
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,470
you know built from narratives of
optimism and so it seems to me that if

824
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
optimism and so it seems to me that if
 

825
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,069
optimism and so it seems to me that if
intelligence does get out in the

826
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:18,079
intelligence does get out in the
 

827
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,670
intelligence does get out in the
universe that it's going to be more

828
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:19,680
universe that it's going to be more
 

829
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,430
universe that it's going to be more
optimism and curiosity driving it than

830
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:21,440
optimism and curiosity driving it than
 

831
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,350
optimism and curiosity driving it than
warren conflict because those things end

832
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:23,360
warren conflict because those things end
 

833
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,870
warren conflict because those things end
up crushing you

834
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:24,880
up crushing you
 

835
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,550
up crushing you
um so there might be some selective

836
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:26,560
um so there might be some selective
 

837
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,949
um so there might be some selective
filter uh of course this is me being an

838
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:28,959
filter uh of course this is me being an
 

839
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,310
filter uh of course this is me being an
optimist i'm a half

840
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,320
optimist i'm a half
 

841
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,069
optimist i'm a half
half full kind of person but is it

842
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:32,079
half full kind of person but is it
 

843
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,629
half full kind of person but is it
obvious that curiosity

844
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:34,639
obvious that curiosity
 

845
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,150
obvious that curiosity
not obvious but what do you think is

846
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,160
not obvious but what do you think is
 

847
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,230
not obvious but what do you think is
curiosity a more powerful force in the

848
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,240
curiosity a more powerful force in the
 

849
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,590
curiosity a more powerful force in the
universe than

850
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:39,600
universe than
 

851
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,350
universe than
violence and

852
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:41,360
violence and
 

853
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,189
violence and
the will to power

854
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:43,199
the will to power
 

855
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,350
the will to power
so uh because you said you frame

856
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:45,360
so uh because you said you frame
 

857
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,710
so uh because you said you frame
curiosity as a way to also plan on how

858
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
curiosity as a way to also plan on how
 

859
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,389
curiosity as a way to also plan on how
to avoid violence which is an

860
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:50,399
to avoid violence which is an
 

861
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,949
to avoid violence which is an
interesting frame of curiosity but i i

862
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:52,959
interesting frame of curiosity but i i
 

863
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,870
interesting frame of curiosity but i i
could also argue that

864
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:54,880
could also argue that
 

865
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,069
could also argue that
violence is a pretty productive way

866
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
violence is a pretty productive way
 

867
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,310
violence is a pretty productive way
to uh operate in the world

868
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:00,320
to uh operate in the world
 

869
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,150
to uh operate in the world
which is like that's one way to protect

870
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,160
which is like that's one way to protect
 

871
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,269
which is like that's one way to protect
yourself the best defense is offense

872
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:05,279
yourself the best defense is offense
 

873
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,189
yourself the best defense is offense
um i'm not qualified to answer this but

874
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:07,199
um i'm not qualified to answer this but
 

875
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,269
um i'm not qualified to answer this but
i'll have a go i think violent let's not

876
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:09,279
i'll have a go i think violent let's not
 

877
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,110
i'll have a go i think violent let's not
talk about violence that's the summary

878
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120
talk about violence that's the summary
 

879
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,269
talk about violence that's the summary
of this podcast

880
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:13,279
of this podcast
 

881
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,829
of this podcast
i would yeah but maybe i would let's

882
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:15,839
i would yeah but maybe i would let's
 

883
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,590
i would yeah but maybe i would let's
call it violence but i call it erasure

884
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:17,600
call it violence but i call it erasure
 

885
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,870
call it violence but i call it erasure
so if you think about um the way

886
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:18,880
so if you think about um the way
 

887
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,069
so if you think about um the way
evolution works all the way uh um

888
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:22,079
evolution works all the way uh um
 

889
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,430
evolution works all the way uh um
obviously talk about assembly's theory

890
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:23,440
obviously talk about assembly's theory
 

891
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,230
obviously talk about assembly's theory
but

892
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:24,240
but
 

893
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,389
but
so if you say you you build pro

894
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:26,399
so if you say you you build pro
 

895
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,230
so if you say you you build pro
curiosity allows you to open up avenues

896
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,240
curiosity allows you to open up avenues
 

897
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,870
curiosity allows you to open up avenues
new graphs right so new features you can

898
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:30,880
new graphs right so new features you can
 

899
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,750
new graphs right so new features you can
play

900
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:31,760
play
 

901
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,629
play
what

902
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:32,639
what
 

903
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,629
what
what the ability to erase those things

904
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:34,639
what the ability to erase those things
 

905
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,629
what the ability to erase those things
allows you to start again and do some

906
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:36,639
allows you to start again and do some
 

907
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,389
allows you to start again and do some
pruning so the universe i think

908
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:38,399
pruning so the universe i think
 

909
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,389
pruning so the universe i think
curiosity gets you further curiosity

910
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:40,399
curiosity gets you further curiosity
 

911
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,470
curiosity gets you further curiosity
gets you rockets that land it gets you

912
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:42,480
gets you rockets that land it gets you
 

913
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,870
gets you rockets that land it gets you
robots that can make drugs it gets you

914
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:44,880
robots that can make drugs it gets you
 

915
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,710
robots that can make drugs it gets you
poetry and art

916
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:46,720
poetry and art
 

917
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,750
poetry and art
and communication and then you know i

918
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:49,760
and communication and then you know i
 

919
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,509
and communication and then you know i
often think wouldn't it be great in

920
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:51,519
often think wouldn't it be great in
 

921
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,269
often think wouldn't it be great in
bureaucracy to have another world war

922
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:53,279
bureaucracy to have another world war
 

923
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,110
bureaucracy to have another world war
not literally a world war now please no

924
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,120
not literally a world war now please no
 

925
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,509
not literally a world war now please no
world war but a the equivalent so we get

926
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:57,519
world war but a the equivalent so we get
 

927
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,590
world war but a the equivalent so we get
remove all the admin bureaucracy right

928
00:14:59,590 --> 00:14:59,600
remove all the admin bureaucracy right
 

929
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,430
remove all the admin bureaucracy right
all the admin violence get rid of it and

930
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:01,440
all the admin violence get rid of it and
 

931
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,110
all the admin violence get rid of it and
start again do you know what i mean

932
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,120
start again do you know what i mean
 

933
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,470
start again do you know what i mean
because you get layers and you get

934
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:04,480
because you get layers and you get
 

935
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,350
because you get layers and you get
redundant systems built so actually

936
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:07,360
redundant systems built so actually
 

937
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,829
redundant systems built so actually
a reset let's call it violence a reset

938
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:09,839
a reset let's call it violence a reset
 

939
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,269
a reset let's call it violence a reset
in some aspects of our um

940
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:13,279
in some aspects of our um
 

941
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,990
in some aspects of our um
culture and our our technology allows us

942
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:16,000
culture and our our technology allows us
 

943
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,750
culture and our our technology allows us
to then

944
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:17,760
to then
 

945
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,670
to then
build more important things without the

946
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:19,680
build more important things without the
 

947
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,949
build more important things without the
because how many you know how many

948
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:20,959
because how many you know how many
 

949
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,470
because how many you know how many
cookies do i have to click on how many

950
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:22,480
cookies do i have to click on how many
 

951
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,949
cookies do i have to click on how many
think how many how many extra clicks i

952
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:24,959
think how many how many extra clicks i
 

953
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,790
think how many how many extra clicks i
do i have in the future of my life that

954
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:26,800
do i have in the future of my life that
 

955
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,790
do i have in the future of my life that
i could remove and a bit of

956
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:28,800
i could remove and a bit of
 

957
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,749
i could remove and a bit of
a reset would would allow us to

958
00:15:31,749 --> 00:15:31,759
a reset would would allow us to
 

959
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,310
a reset would would allow us to
to uh to start again and maybe that's

960
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,320
to uh to start again and maybe that's
 

961
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,389
to uh to start again and maybe that's
how i suppose our encounter with aliens

962
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:36,399
how i suppose our encounter with aliens
 

963
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,990
how i suppose our encounter with aliens
will be maybe they will fight with us

964
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,000
will be maybe they will fight with us
 

965
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,629
will be maybe they will fight with us
and say uh he went on as excited by you

966
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:40,639
and say uh he went on as excited by you
 

967
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,389
and say uh he went on as excited by you
so we thought we'll just get rid of you

968
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:42,399
so we thought we'll just get rid of you
 

969
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,389
so we thought we'll just get rid of you
so they might want to reset earth yeah

970
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:44,399
so they might want to reset earth yeah
 

971
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,069
so they might want to reset earth yeah
why not to be like let's see how the

972
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:46,079
why not to be like let's see how the
 

973
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,310
why not to be like let's see how the
evolution runs again this seems like

974
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:48,320
evolution runs again this seems like
 

975
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,829
evolution runs again this seems like
they've uh

976
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:49,839
they've uh
 

977
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,509
they've uh
uh there's nothing new happening here

978
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:51,519
uh there's nothing new happening here
 

979
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,269
uh there's nothing new happening here
they're observing for a while this is

980
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:53,279
they're observing for a while this is
 

981
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,910
they're observing for a while this is
just not let's keep it more fun let's

982
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:55,920
just not let's keep it more fun let's
 

983
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,949
just not let's keep it more fun let's
start with the fish again

984
00:15:58,949 --> 00:15:58,959

 

985
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,310

i like how you equated violence to um

986
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:02,320
i like how you equated violence to um
 

987
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,550
i like how you equated violence to um
resetting your cookies yeah i suppose

988
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:04,560
resetting your cookies yeah i suppose
 

989
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,230
resetting your cookies yeah i suppose
that's the kind of violence

990
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:06,240
that's the kind of violence
 

991
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,069
that's the kind of violence
in this modern world where wards are

992
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:08,079
in this modern world where wards are
 

993
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,230
in this modern world where wards are
violence resetting cookies i don't know

994
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:10,240
violence resetting cookies i don't know
 

995
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,990
violence resetting cookies i don't know
where that came from i'm completely yeah

996
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,000
where that came from i'm completely yeah
 

997
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,189
where that came from i'm completely yeah
that's poetic uh really okay so let's

998
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:15,199
that's poetic uh really okay so let's
 

999
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,509
that's poetic uh really okay so let's
talk about life

1000
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:17,519
talk about life
 

1001
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,189
talk about life
what is life

1002
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:19,199
what is life
 

1003
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,790
what is life
what is non-life

1004
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:20,800
what is non-life
 

1005
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,389
what is non-life
what is the line between life and

1006
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:22,399
what is the line between life and
 

1007
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,030
what is the line between life and
non-life and maybe at any point we can

1008
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,040
non-life and maybe at any point we can
 

1009
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,670
non-life and maybe at any point we can
pull in ideas of assembly theory

1010
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:27,680
pull in ideas of assembly theory
 

1011
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,509
pull in ideas of assembly theory
like how do we start to try to define

1012
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:29,519
like how do we start to try to define
 

1013
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,030
like how do we start to try to define
life and for people

1014
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,040
life and for people
 

1015
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,509
life and for people
uh listening so sarah

1016
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:33,519
uh listening so sarah
 

1017
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,990
uh listening so sarah
identifies as a physicist and lee

1018
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,000
identifies as a physicist and lee
 

1019
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,949
identifies as a physicist and lee
identifies as a chemist of course they

1020
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:38,959
identifies as a chemist of course they
 

1021
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,590
identifies as a chemist of course they
are very interdisciplinary in nature in

1022
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:41,600
are very interdisciplinary in nature in
 

1023
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,949
are very interdisciplinary in nature in
general but

1024
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:42,959
general but
 

1025
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,710
general but
um

1026
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:44,720
um
 

1027
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,710
um
so what is life

1028
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:46,720
so what is life
 

1029
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,710
so what is life
yeah

1030
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:48,720
yeah
 

1031
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,470
yeah
yeah i love asking that question because

1032
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:50,480
yeah i love asking that question because
 

1033
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,829
yeah i love asking that question because
it's so absurdly big i know i love it um

1034
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:53,839
it's so absurdly big i know i love it um
 

1035
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,269
it's so absurdly big i know i love it um
it's my absolute favorite question the

1036
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:55,279
it's my absolute favorite question the
 

1037
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,670
it's my absolute favorite question the
whole universe um so i think i have

1038
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:57,680
whole universe um so i think i have
 

1039
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,389
whole universe um so i think i have
three ways of describing it right now um

1040
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:00,399
three ways of describing it right now um
 

1041
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,590
three ways of describing it right now um
and i like to say all three of them

1042
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:01,600
and i like to say all three of them
 

1043
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,710
and i like to say all three of them
because people latch onto different

1044
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:02,720
because people latch onto different
 

1045
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,669
because people latch onto different
facets of them and so the whole idea of

1046
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:05,679
facets of them and so the whole idea of
 

1047
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,110
facets of them and so the whole idea of
what lee and i are trying to work on is

1048
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:07,120
what lee and i are trying to work on is
 

1049
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,789
what lee and i are trying to work on is
not to try to define life but to try to

1050
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:08,799
not to try to define life but to try to
 

1051
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,150
not to try to define life but to try to
find a more fundamental theory that

1052
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,160
find a more fundamental theory that
 

1053
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,309
find a more fundamental theory that
explains what the phenomena we call life

1054
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:12,319
explains what the phenomena we call life
 

1055
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,590
explains what the phenomena we call life
and then it should explain certain

1056
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:13,600
and then it should explain certain
 

1057
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,870
and then it should explain certain
attributes and you end up having a

1058
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:14,880
attributes and you end up having a
 

1059
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,630
attributes and you end up having a
really different framing than way people

1060
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:16,640
really different framing than way people
 

1061
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,470
really different framing than way people
usually talk so the way i i talk about

1062
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:18,480
usually talk so the way i i talk about
 

1063
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,909
usually talk so the way i i talk about
it three different ways

1064
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:19,919
it three different ways
 

1065
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,470
it three different ways
um life is how information structures

1066
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:22,480
um life is how information structures
 

1067
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,549
um life is how information structures
matter across space and time

1068
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:24,559
matter across space and time
 

1069
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,470
matter across space and time
um life is

1070
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:26,480
um life is
 

1071
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,510
um life is
uh

1072
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:27,520
uh
 

1073
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,470
uh
i don't know

1074
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:28,480
i don't know
 

1075
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,990
i don't know
this one's from you actually simple

1076
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,000
this one's from you actually simple
 

1077
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,430
this one's from you actually simple
machines constructing more complex

1078
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:31,440
machines constructing more complex
 

1079
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,789
machines constructing more complex
machines

1080
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:32,799
machines
 

1081
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,870
machines
and the other one is the physics of

1082
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:34,880
and the other one is the physics of
 

1083
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,350
and the other one is the physics of
existence so to speak which is

1084
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:37,360
existence so to speak which is
 

1085
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,510
existence so to speak which is
life is the mechanism the universe has

1086
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:39,520
life is the mechanism the universe has
 

1087
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,150
life is the mechanism the universe has
to explore the space of what's possible

1088
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:42,160
to explore the space of what's possible
 

1089
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,669
to explore the space of what's possible
um that's my favorite

1090
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:43,679
um that's my favorite
 

1091
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,630
um that's my favorite
so can i yeah yeah can i add on to that

1092
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:46,640
so can i yeah yeah can i add on to that
 

1093
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,310
so can i yeah yeah can i add on to that
okay can you say the physics one again

1094
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,320
okay can you say the physics one again
 

1095
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,110
okay can you say the physics one again
uh oh the physics of existence yeah the

1096
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:51,120
uh oh the physics of existence yeah the
 

1097
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,630
uh oh the physics of existence yeah the
physics of existence i don't know what

1098
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:52,640
physics of existence i don't know what
 

1099
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,150
physics of existence i don't know what
to call it you know like if you think of

1100
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:54,160
to call it you know like if you think of
 

1101
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,830
to call it you know like if you think of
all the things that could exist only

1102
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:55,840
all the things that could exist only
 

1103
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,150
all the things that could exist only
certain things do exist and i think life

1104
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:58,160
certain things do exist and i think life
 

1105
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,270
certain things do exist and i think life
is basically the universe's mechanism of

1106
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:01,280
is basically the universe's mechanism of
 

1107
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,110
is basically the universe's mechanism of
bringing things into physically existing

1108
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,120
bringing things into physically existing
 

1109
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,430
bringing things into physically existing
in the in the moment now

1110
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:05,440
in the in the moment now
 

1111
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,549
in the in the moment now
yeah

1112
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:06,559
yeah
 

1113
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,470
yeah
yeah well what's what's another one

1114
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:08,480
yeah well what's what's another one
 

1115
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,390
yeah well what's what's another one
we were debating this the other day so

1116
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:10,400
we were debating this the other day so
 

1117
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,710
we were debating this the other day so
if you think about universe that has

1118
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:12,720
if you think about universe that has
 

1119
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,029
if you think about universe that has
nothing in it that's kind of hard to

1120
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:15,039
nothing in it that's kind of hard to
 

1121
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,710
nothing in it that's kind of hard to
conceive of right because and this is

1122
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,720
conceive of right because and this is
 

1123
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,390
conceive of right because and this is
where physicists really go wrong they

1124
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:18,400
where physicists really go wrong they
 

1125
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,830
where physicists really go wrong they
think of a universe with nothing in it

1126
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:19,840
think of a universe with nothing in it
 

1127
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,830
think of a universe with nothing in it
they can't and you think non-existence

1128
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:21,840
they can't and you think non-existence
 

1129
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,270
they can't and you think non-existence
is really hard to think

1130
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:23,280
is really hard to think
 

1131
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,789
is really hard to think
yeah and then you think of universe with

1132
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:24,799
yeah and then you think of universe with
 

1133
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,710
yeah and then you think of universe with
everything in it

1134
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:26,720
everything in it
 

1135
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,710
everything in it
that's really hard and and you just you

1136
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:28,720
that's really hard and and you just you
 

1137
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,470
that's really hard and and you just you
just have this white blob right this is

1138
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:30,480
just have this white blob right this is
 

1139
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,630
just have this white blob right this is
everything but the fact we have to

1140
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:32,640
everything but the fact we have to
 

1141
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,789
everything but the fact we have to
discrete stuff in the universe beyonce

1142
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:34,799
discrete stuff in the universe beyonce
 

1143

planet so you've got stars space planet

1144
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:37,200
planet so you've got stars space planet
 

1145
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,310
planet so you've got stars space planet
stuff right the boring stuff

1146
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:40,320
stuff right the boring stuff
 

1147
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,549
stuff right the boring stuff
but i would define life or say that life

1148
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:42,559
but i would define life or say that life
 

1149
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,390
but i would define life or say that life
is where

1150
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:44,400
is where
 

1151
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,470
is where
there are architectures any

1152
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:46,480
there are architectures any
 

1153
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,669
there are architectures any
architectures and we should stop

1154
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:47,679
architectures and we should stop
 

1155
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,590
architectures and we should stop
fixating on

1156
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:49,600
fixating on
 

1157
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,590

what bill is building the architectures

1158
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:51,600
what bill is building the architectures
 

1159
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,270
what bill is building the architectures
to start with and the fact that the

1160
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,280
to start with and the fact that the
 

1161
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,830
to start with and the fact that the
universe has discrete things and it is

1162
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:55,840
universe has discrete things and it is
 

1163
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,669
universe has discrete things and it is
completely mind-blowing

1164
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:57,679
completely mind-blowing
 

1165
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,789
completely mind-blowing
if you think about it for one second

1166
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:00,799
if you think about it for one second
 

1167
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,510
if you think about it for one second
the fact there's any objects at all that

1168
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:03,520
the fact there's any objects at all that
 

1169
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,990
the fact there's any objects at all that
and there's because for me the the

1170
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,000
and there's because for me the the
 

1171
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,510
and there's because for me the the
object is a proxy for a machine that

1172
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:09,520
object is a proxy for a machine that
 

1173
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,909
object is a proxy for a machine that
built it some information

1174
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:11,919
built it some information
 

1175
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:12,789
built it some information
um

1176
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:12,799
um
 

1177
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,710
um
being moved around

1178
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:14,720

actuation sensing

1180
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:16,880

getting resource
 

1183
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,549
getting resource
and building these objects so for me

1184
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:20,559
and building these objects so for me
 

1185
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,990
and building these objects so for me
everyone's been obsessing about the

1186
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,000
everyone's been obsessing about the
 

1187
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,350
everyone's been obsessing about the
machine

1188
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:23,360
machine
 

1189
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,750
machine
but i'm like forget the machine let's

1190
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:25,760
but i'm like forget the machine let's
 

1191
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,070
but i'm like forget the machine let's
see the objects the you know and i think

1192
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,080
see the objects the you know and i think
 

1193
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,150
see the objects the you know and i think
in a way that assembly theory

1194
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:30,160
in a way that assembly theory
 

1195
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,909
in a way that assembly theory
we realized maybe a few months ago that

1196
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:31,919
we realized maybe a few months ago that
 

1197
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,549
we realized maybe a few months ago that
assembly theory actually does

1198
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:34,559
assembly theory actually does
 

1199
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,310
assembly theory actually does
account for the soul in the objects not

1200
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:36,320
account for the soul in the objects not
 

1201
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,710
account for the soul in the objects not
mystically like say sheldrick's morphic

1202
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:38,720
mystically like say sheldrick's morphic
 

1203
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,750
mystically like say sheldrick's morphic
resonance or leibniz's monodology seeing

1204
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:41,760
resonance or leibniz's monodology seeing
 

1205
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,669
resonance or leibniz's monodology seeing
souls and things but when you see an

1206
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:43,679
souls and things but when you see an
 

1207
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,990
souls and things but when you see an
object and i've said this before but

1208
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,000
object and i've said this before but
 

1209
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,110
object and i've said this before but
this object is evidence of thought

1210
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:49,120
this object is evidence of thought
 

1211
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,710
this object is evidence of thought
and then there's a lineage of those

1212
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:50,720
and then there's a lineage of those
 

1213
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,549
and then there's a lineage of those
objects so i think what is fascinating

1214
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:52,559
objects so i think what is fascinating
 

1215
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,190
objects so i think what is fascinating
is

1216
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,200
is
 

1217
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,470
is
that um

1218
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:54,480
that um
 

1219
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,630
that um
you put it much more elegantly but but

1220
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:56,640
you put it much more elegantly but but
 

1221
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,549
you put it much more elegantly but but
the barrier between life and non-life is

1222
00:19:58,549 --> 00:19:58,559
the barrier between life and non-life is
 

1223
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,430
the barrier between life and non-life is
accruing enough memories to then actuate

1224
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:01,440
accruing enough memories to then actuate
 

1225
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,470
accruing enough memories to then actuate
so

1226
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:02,480
so
 

1227
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,909
so
so what that means is there are

1228
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:03,919
so what that means is there are
 

1229
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,590
so what that means is there are
contingency there are things that happen

1230
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:05,600
contingency there are things that happen
 

1231
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,870
contingency there are things that happen
in the universe get trapped these

1232
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:06,880
in the universe get trapped these
 

1233
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,870
in the universe get trapped these
memories then have a causal effect on

1234
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:08,880
memories then have a causal effect on
 

1235
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,990
memories then have a causal effect on
the future

1236
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,000
the future
 

1237
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,750
the future
and then when you get those concentrated

1238
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:11,760
and then when you get those concentrated
 

1239
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,510
and then when you get those concentrated
in a machine and you're actually able in

1240
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:13,520
in a machine and you're actually able in
 

1241
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,149
in a machine and you're actually able in
real time able to integrate

1242
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:16,159
real time able to integrate
 

1243
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,669
real time able to integrate
the past

1244
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:17,679
the past
 

1245
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,750
the past
the present with the future and do stuff

1246
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:19,760
the present with the future and do stuff
 

1247
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,230
the present with the future and do stuff
that's when you are most alive

1248
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,240
that's when you are most alive
 

1249
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,710
that's when you are most alive
are you being the machine yes wait a

1250
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:24,720
are you being the machine yes wait a
 

1251
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,510
are you being the machine yes wait a
minute why is the object so one one of

1252
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:27,520
minute why is the object so one one of
 

1253
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,750
minute why is the object so one one of
the ways to define life uh that sarah

1254
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:29,760
the ways to define life uh that sarah
 

1255
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,710
the ways to define life uh that sarah
said

1256
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:30,720
said
 

1257
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,789
said
is simple machines creating complex

1258
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:32,799
is simple machines creating complex
 

1259
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,430
is simple machines creating complex
machines so

1260
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:35,440
machines so
 

1261
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,830
machines so
there's a million questions there so how

1262
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:37,840
there's a million questions there so how
 

1263
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,430
there's a million questions there so how
how the hell does a simple machine

1264
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:39,440
how the hell does a simple machine
 

1265
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,350
how the hell does a simple machine
create a complex machine

1266
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:41,360
create a complex machine
 

1267
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,710
create a complex machine
mutation

1268
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:42,720
mutation
 

1269
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,830
mutation
so this is what we're talking about at

1270
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:43,840
so this is what we're talking about at
 

1271
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,789
so this is what we're talking about at
the beginning you have the minimum

1272
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:44,799
the beginning you have the minimum
 

1273
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,549
the beginning you have the minimum
replicator so molecule so this is what i

1274
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:46,559
replicator so molecule so this is what i
 

1275
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:47,830
replicator so molecule so this is what i
was trying to convince sarah if the

1276
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:47,840
was trying to convince sarah if the
 

1277
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,590
was trying to convince sarah if the
mechanism get there years ago i think

1278
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:49,600
mechanism get there years ago i think
 

1279
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,950
mechanism get there years ago i think
but then you've been building on it and

1280
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:50,960
but then you've been building on it and
 

1281
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,470
but then you've been building on it and
saying

1282
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:52,480
saying
 

1283
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,750
saying
you have a small you have a molecule

1284
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:53,760
you have a small you have a molecule
 

1285
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,669
you have a small you have a molecule
that can copy itself

1286
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:55,679
that can copy itself
 

1287
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,430
that can copy itself
but then that be a has there has to be

1288
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:57,440
but then that be a has there has to be
 

1289
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,950
but then that be a has there has to be
some variability otherwise it's not

1290
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:58,960
some variability otherwise it's not
 

1291
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,630
some variability otherwise it's not
going to get more functional so you need

1292
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:00,640
going to get more functional so you need
 

1293
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,789
going to get more functional so you need
to add bits on so you have a minimum

1294
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:02,799
to add bits on so you have a minimum
 

1295
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,870
to add bits on so you have a minimum
molecule that can copy itself but then

1296
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:04,880
molecule that can copy itself but then
 

1297
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,149
molecule that can copy itself but then
it can add bits on and that can be

1298
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:06,159
it can add bits on and that can be
 

1299
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,310
it can add bits on and that can be
copied as well and those add-ons can

1300
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:08,320
copied as well and those add-ons can
 

1301
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,470
copied as well and those add-ons can
give you additional function

1302
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:10,480
give you additional function
 

1303
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,390
give you additional function
um

1304
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:12,400
um
 

1305
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,549
um
to be able to acquire more stuff to

1306
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:14,559
to be able to acquire more stuff to
 

1307
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,590
to be able to acquire more stuff to
exist

1308
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:15,600
exist
 

1309
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,310
exist
so existence is weird

1310
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:18,320
so existence is weird
 

1311
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,310
so existence is weird
but the fact that there is existence is

1312
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:20,320
but the fact that there is existence is
 

1313
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,750
but the fact that there is existence is
why there is life and that's why i

1314
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:21,760
why there is life and that's why i
 

1315
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,149
why there is life and that's why i
realized a few days ago that there must

1316
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:24,159
realized a few days ago that there must
 

1317
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,990
realized a few days ago that there must
be that's why alien life must be

1318
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,000
be that's why alien life must be
 

1319
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,190
be that's why alien life must be
everywhere

1320
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:27,200
everywhere
 

1321
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,350
everywhere
because there is existence is there like

1322
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,360
because there is existence is there like
 

1323
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,110
because there is existence is there like
a conservation

1324
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:31,120
a conservation
 

1325
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,110
a conservation
of cheeky stuff

1326
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,120
of cheeky stuff
 

1327
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,110
of cheeky stuff
happening so like how can you keep

1328
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,120
happening so like how can you keep
 

1329
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,669
happening so like how can you keep
injecting more complex things

1330
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:37,679
injecting more complex things
 

1331
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:38,870
injecting more complex things
like um

1332
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:38,880
like um
 

1333
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,789
like um
doesn't the machine that creates the

1334
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:40,799
doesn't the machine that creates the
 

1335
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,549
doesn't the machine that creates the
object need to be

1336
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:42,559
object need to be
 

1337
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,350
object need to be
as or more complex more

1338
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:45,360
as or more complex more
 

1339
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,310
as or more complex more
powerful than the things it creates

1340
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:48,320
powerful than the things it creates
 

1341
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,149
powerful than the things it creates
so how can you get complexity from

1342
00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:50,159
so how can you get complexity from
 

1343
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,750
so how can you get complexity from
simplicity

1344
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:51,760
simplicity
 

1345
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,630
simplicity
so

1346
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:52,640
so
 

1347
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,990
so
the way you get complexity from

1348
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:54,000
the way you get complexity from
 

1349
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,070
the way you get complexity from
simplicity is that you

1350
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,080
simplicity is that you
 

1351
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,669
simplicity is that you
i would this i'm just making this up but

1352
00:21:57,669 --> 00:21:57,679
i would this i'm just making this up but
 

1353
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:58,789
i would this i'm just making this up but
this is kind of my notion that you have

1354
00:21:58,789 --> 00:21:58,799
this is kind of my notion that you have
 

1355
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,310
this is kind of my notion that you have
a large volume of stuff

1356
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:00,320
a large volume of stuff
 

1357
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,470
a large volume of stuff
so you're able to get um

1358
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:02,480
so you're able to get um
 

1359
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,110
so you're able to get um
seeds if you like random cues from the

1360
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,120
seeds if you like random cues from the
 

1361
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,789
seeds if you like random cues from the
environment so you just use those

1362
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:06,799
environment so you just use those
 

1363
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,669
environment so you just use those
objects to basically write on your tape

1364
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:09,679
objects to basically write on your tape
 

1365
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,110
objects to basically write on your tape
ones and zeros whatever and that is that

1366
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,120
ones and zeros whatever and that is that
 

1367
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,950
ones and zeros whatever and that is that
is necessarily

1368
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:14,960
is necessarily
 

1369
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,710
is necessarily
rich complex

1370
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:16,720
rich complex
 

1371
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,590
rich complex
okay

1372
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:17,600
okay
 

1373
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,990
okay
but it has a low assembliness but even

1374
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,000
but it has a low assembliness but even
 

1375
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,270
but it has a low assembliness but even
though it has a higher assembly number

1376
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,280
though it has a higher assembly number
 

1377
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,110
though it has a higher assembly number
we can talk about that but then when you

1378
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,120
we can talk about that but then when you
 

1379
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,789
we can talk about that but then when you
start to then integrate that all into a

1380
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:24,799
start to then integrate that all into a
 

1381
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,630
start to then integrate that all into a
smaller volume as over time

1382
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:28,640
smaller volume as over time
 

1383
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,110
smaller volume as over time
and you become more autonomous

1384
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:31,120
and you become more autonomous
 

1385
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,870
and you become more autonomous
you then make the transition

1386
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:32,880
you then make the transition
 

1387
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,870
you then make the transition
i don't know what you think about that i

1388
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:34,880
i don't know what you think about that i
 

1389
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,909
i don't know what you think about that i
think

1390
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:35,919
think
 

1391
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,350
think
the easiest way

1392
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:37,360
the easiest way
 

1393
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,029
the easiest way
to think about it is actually which i

1394
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:39,039
to think about it is actually which i
 

1395
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,470
to think about it is actually which i
know is a concept you hate but i also

1396
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:40,480
know is a concept you hate but i also
 

1397
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,149
know is a concept you hate but i also
hate which is entropy but people are

1398
00:22:42,149 --> 00:22:42,159
hate which is entropy but people are
 

1399
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,510
hate which is entropy but people are
more familiar with entropy than what we

1400
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:43,520
more familiar with entropy than what we
 

1401
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,270
more familiar with entropy than what we
talk about in assembly theory

1402
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:45,280
talk about in assembly theory
 

1403
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,750
talk about in assembly theory
um and also the idea that

1404
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:47,760
um and also the idea that
 

1405
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,070
um and also the idea that
like say physics as we know it um

1406
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,080
like say physics as we know it um
 

1407
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,230
like say physics as we know it um
involves objects that don't exist across

1408
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,240
involves objects that don't exist across
 

1409
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,070
involves objects that don't exist across
time or as we would say low memory

1410
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,080
time or as we would say low memory
 

1411
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,110
time or as we would say low memory
objects

1412
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,120
objects
 

1413
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,270
objects
um so one of the the key distinctions

1414
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:57,280
um so one of the the key distinctions
 

1415
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,310
um so one of the the key distinctions
that that low memory objects yeah so

1416
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:00,320
that that low memory objects yeah so
 

1417
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,630
that that low memory objects yeah so
physics is all physicists are low memory

1418
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:02,640
physics is all physicists are low memory
 

1419
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,950
physics is all physicists are low memory
memory objects

1420
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:04,960
memory objects
 

1421
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,510
memory objects
physicists are creators of low memory

1422
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:07,520
physicists are creators of low memory
 

1423
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,510
physicists are creators of low memory
objects or manipulators of low memory

1424
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:09,520
objects or manipulators of low memory
 

1425
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,350
objects or manipulators of low memory
objects absolutely that's a very nice

1426
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:11,360
objects absolutely that's a very nice
 

1427
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,710
objects absolutely that's a very nice
way

1428
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:12,720
way
 

1429
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,470
way
putting okay sorry guys yeah

1430
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:14,480
putting okay sorry guys yeah
 

1431
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,630
putting okay sorry guys yeah
sorry to keep in trouble no it's fine um

1432
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:16,640
sorry to keep in trouble no it's fine um
 

1433
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,110
sorry to keep in trouble no it's fine um
i like it too it's very funny um but i

1434
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,120
i like it too it's very funny um but i
 

1435
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,310
i like it too it's very funny um but i
think it's a good way of phrasing it

1436
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:20,320
think it's a good way of phrasing it
 

1437
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,750
think it's a good way of phrasing it
because i i think you know this kind of

1438
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:21,760
because i i think you know this kind of
 

1439
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,750
because i i think you know this kind of
idea we have an assembly theory is that

1440
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:23,760
idea we have an assembly theory is that
 

1441
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,630
idea we have an assembly theory is that
um

1442
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:24,640
um
 

1443
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,310
um
you know physics as we know it has

1444
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:26,320
you know physics as we know it has
 

1445
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,870
you know physics as we know it has
basically removed time as being a

1446
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:28,880
basically removed time as being a
 

1447
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,990
basically removed time as being a
physical observable of an object and the

1448
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:32,000
physical observable of an object and the
 

1449
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,669
physical observable of an object and the
argument i would make is that when you

1450
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:33,679
argument i would make is that when you
 

1451
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,990
argument i would make is that when you
look at things like water bottles or us

1452
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,000
look at things like water bottles or us
 

1453
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,510
look at things like water bottles or us
we're actually

1454
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:37,520
we're actually
 

1455
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,350
we're actually
things that exist that have a large

1456
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:39,360
things that exist that have a large
 

1457
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,870
things that exist that have a large
extent in time

1458
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:40,880
extent in time
 

1459
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,870
extent in time
so we actually have a

1460
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:42,880
so we actually have a
 

1461
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,430
so we actually have a
physical size and time and we measure

1462
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:45,440
physical size and time and we measure
 

1463
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,950
physical size and time and we measure
that with something called the assembly

1464
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:46,960
that with something called the assembly
 

1465
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,630
that with something called the assembly
index

1466
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:48,640
index
 

1467
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,870
index
in molecules but presumably everyone

1468
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:50,880
in molecules but presumably everyone
 

1469
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,549
in molecules but presumably everyone
should have sort of a

1470
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:52,559
should have sort of a
 

1471
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,870
should have sort of a
uh do you want to explain what assembly

1472
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:54,880
uh do you want to explain what assembly
 

1473
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,430
uh do you want to explain what assembly
yeah let's you know what let's step back

1474
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:57,440
yeah let's you know what let's step back
 

1475
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,149
yeah let's you know what let's step back
and

1476
00:23:58,149 --> 00:23:58,159
and
 

1477
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,830
and
and start at the beginning what is

1478
00:23:59,830 --> 00:23:59,840
and start at the beginning what is
 

1479
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,990
and start at the beginning what is
assembly theory lee send me some slides

1480
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,000
assembly theory lee send me some slides
 

1481
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,390
assembly theory lee send me some slides
there's a there's a big sexy paper

1482
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:04,400
there's a there's a big sexy paper
 

1483
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,909
there's a there's a big sexy paper
coming out probably

1484
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:05,919
coming out probably
 

1485
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,149
coming out probably
maybe i don't know we've almost finished

1486
00:24:08,149 --> 00:24:08,159
maybe i don't know we've almost finished
 

1487
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,029
maybe i don't know we've almost finished
it

1488
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:09,039
it
 

1489
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,149
it
um

1490
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:10,159
um
 

1491
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,070
um
almost almost that's like that's also a

1492
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:12,080
almost almost that's like that's also a
 

1493
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,430
almost almost that's like that's also a
summary of science we're almost done yes

1494
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:15,440
summary of science we're almost done yes
 

1495
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,510
summary of science we're almost done yes
we're almost done the history of science

1496
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:17,520
we're almost done the history of science
 

1497
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,669
we're almost done the history of science
we are ready to start an interesting

1498
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:19,679
we are ready to start an interesting
 

1499
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,669
we are ready to start an interesting
discussion with our peers

1500
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:21,679
discussion with our peers
 

1501
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,510
discussion with our peers
right you're the machine that created

1502
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:23,520
right you're the machine that created
 

1503
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,870
right you're the machine that created
the object and we'll see where the

1504
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:24,880
the object and we'll see where the
 

1505
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,070
the object and we'll see where the
object takes

1506
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,080
object takes
 

1507
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,149
object takes
all right so what what is assembly

1508
00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:28,159
all right so what what is assembly
 

1509
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,149
all right so what what is assembly
theory um yeah well i think i think the

1510
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:30,159
theory um yeah well i think i think the
 

1511
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,510
theory um yeah well i think i think the
easiest way for people to understand it

1512
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:31,520
easiest way for people to understand it
 

1513
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,669
easiest way for people to understand it
is to think about um

1514
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:33,679
is to think about um
 

1515
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,269
is to think about um
assembly in molecules although the

1516
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:35,279
assembly in molecules although the
 

1517
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,789
assembly in molecules although the
theory is very general doesn't just

1518
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:36,799
theory is very general doesn't just
 

1519
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,710
theory is very general doesn't just
apply to molecules and this was really

1520
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:38,720
apply to molecules and this was really
 

1521
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,230
apply to molecules and this was really
leased in sight so it's kind of funny

1522
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:40,240
leased in sight so it's kind of funny
 

1523
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,470
leased in sight so it's kind of funny
that i'm explaining it but um okay i'll

1524
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:42,480
that i'm explaining it but um okay i'll
 

1525
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,029
that i'm explaining it but um okay i'll
mark you okay all right ready i'm ready

1526
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:45,039
mark you okay all right ready i'm ready
 

1527
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,710
mark you okay all right ready i'm ready
i'm ready tell me where i get the check

1528
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:46,720
i'm ready tell me where i get the check
 

1529
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,549
i'm ready tell me where i get the check
marks minus but it's your theory as well

1530
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:48,559
marks minus but it's your theory as well
 

1531
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,190
marks minus but it's your theory as well
yeah i know but ima imagine a molecule

1532
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:51,200
yeah i know but ima imagine a molecule
 

1533
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,190
yeah i know but ima imagine a molecule
um and then and then you can you know

1534
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:53,200
um and then and then you can you know
 

1535
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,110
um and then and then you can you know
break the molecule apart into elementary

1536
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,120
break the molecule apart into elementary
 

1537
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,950
break the molecule apart into elementary
building blocks they happen to be bonds

1538
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:56,960
building blocks they happen to be bonds
 

1539
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,470
building blocks they happen to be bonds
and then you can think of all the ways

1540
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:58,480
and then you can think of all the ways
 

1541
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,830
and then you can think of all the ways
for molecular assembly theory you can

1542
00:24:59,830 --> 00:24:59,840
for molecular assembly theory you can
 

1543
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,269
for molecular assembly theory you can
think about all the ways of building up

1544
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:01,279
think about all the ways of building up
 

1545
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,630
think about all the ways of building up
the original molecule so there's all

1546
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:02,640
the original molecule so there's all
 

1547
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,830
the original molecule so there's all
these paths

1548
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:03,840
these paths
 

1549
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,590
these paths
that you can assemble it and the sort of

1550
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:05,600
that you can assemble it and the sort of
 

1551
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,430
that you can assemble it and the sort of
rules or assembly is you can use pieces

1552
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:07,440
rules or assembly is you can use pieces
 

1553
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,269
rules or assembly is you can use pieces
that have been generated already

1554
00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:09,279
that have been generated already
 

1555
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,549
that have been generated already
so it has this kind of recursive

1556
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:10,559
so it has this kind of recursive
 

1557
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,870
so it has this kind of recursive
property to it um and so that's where

1558
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:12,880
property to it um and so that's where
 

1559
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,310
property to it um and so that's where
kind of memory comes into assembly

1560
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:14,320
kind of memory comes into assembly
 

1561
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,590
kind of memory comes into assembly
theory and then the assembly index is

1562
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:17,600
theory and then the assembly index is
 

1563
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,590
theory and then the assembly index is
the shortest path in that space so it's

1564
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:19,600
the shortest path in that space so it's
 

1565
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,870
the shortest path in that space so it's
supposed to be the minimal amount of

1566
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:20,880
supposed to be the minimal amount of
 

1567
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,110
supposed to be the minimal amount of
history that the universe has to undergo

1568
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,120
history that the universe has to undergo
 

1569
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,630
history that the universe has to undergo
in order to assemble that particular

1570
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:24,640
in order to assemble that particular
 

1571
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,470
in order to assemble that particular
object and the reason that this is

1572
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:26,480
object and the reason that this is
 

1573
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,470
object and the reason that this is
significant is we figured out how to

1574
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:28,480
significant is we figured out how to
 

1575
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,390
significant is we figured out how to
measure that

1576
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:30,400
measure that
 

1577
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,230
measure that
with a mass spec

1578
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:32,240
with a mass spec
 

1579
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,190
with a mass spec
in the lab and we had this conjecture

1580
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:35,200
in the lab and we had this conjecture
 

1581
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,870
in the lab and we had this conjecture
that if that minimal number of steps was

1582
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:36,880
that if that minimal number of steps was
 

1583
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,390
that if that minimal number of steps was
sufficiently large

1584
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:38,400
sufficiently large
 

1585
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,830
sufficiently large
it would indicate that you required a

1586
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:39,840
it would indicate that you required a
 

1587
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,510
it would indicate that you required a
machine or a system that had information

1588
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:41,520
machine or a system that had information
 

1589
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,870
machine or a system that had information
about how to assemble that specific

1590
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:42,880
about how to assemble that specific
 

1591
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,390
about how to assemble that specific
object because the combinatorial space

1592
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:44,400
object because the combinatorial space
 

1593
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,070
object because the combinatorial space
of possibilities is getting

1594
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,080
of possibilities is getting
 

1595
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,750
of possibilities is getting
exponentially large as the assembly

1596
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:47,760
exponentially large as the assembly
 

1597
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,830
exponentially large as the assembly
index is increasing so it's just sorry

1598
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:49,840
index is increasing so it's just sorry
 

1599
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,390
index is increasing so it's just sorry
to interrupt but so that means there's a

1600
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:52,400
to interrupt but so that means there's a
 

1601
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,590
to interrupt but so that means there's a
sufficiently high assembly index

1602
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:55,600
sufficiently high assembly index
 

1603
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,470
sufficiently high assembly index
that

1604
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:56,480
that
 

1605
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,510
that
if observed in an object

1606
00:25:59,510 --> 00:25:59,520
if observed in an object
 

1607
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,350
if observed in an object
is an indicator that

1608
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:01,360
is an indicator that
 

1609
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,470
is an indicator that
something

1610
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:02,480
something
 

1611
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,110
something
life like created it or is the object

1612
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:05,120
life like created it or is the object
 

1613
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,870
life like created it or is the object
itself life like

1614
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:06,880
itself life like
 

1615
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,310
itself life like
um both

1616
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:08,320
um both
 

1617
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,350
um both
but you might want to make the

1618
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:09,360
but you might want to make the
 

1619
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,510
but you might want to make the
distinction that a water bottle is not

1620
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:11,520
distinction that a water bottle is not
 

1621
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,390
distinction that a water bottle is not
life

1622
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:12,400
life
 

1623
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,630
life
but it would still be a signature that

1624
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:14,640
but it would still be a signature that
 

1625
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,470
but it would still be a signature that
you were in that domain of physics

1626
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:16,480
you were in that domain of physics
 

1627
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,310
you were in that domain of physics
and i might be alive

1628
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:18,320
and i might be alive
 

1629
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,669
and i might be alive
so um

1630
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:19,679
so um
 

1631
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,510
so um
so there will be potentially a lot of

1632
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:21,520
so there will be potentially a lot of
 

1633
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,310
so there will be potentially a lot of
arguments about where the line at which

1634
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:24,320
arguments about where the line at which
 

1635
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,909
arguments about where the line at which
assembly index

1636
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:25,919
assembly index
 

1637
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:26,710
assembly index
uh

1638
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:26,720
uh
 

1639
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,710
uh
does interesting stuff start to happen

1640
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:28,720
does interesting stuff start to happen
 

1641
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,990
does interesting stuff start to happen
the point is we can make all the

1642
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:30,000
the point is we can make all the
 

1643
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,870
the point is we can make all the
arguments but it should be

1644
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:30,880
arguments but it should be
 

1645
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,950
arguments but it should be
experimentally observable and and we can

1646
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:32,960
experimentally observable and and we can
 

1647
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,710
experimentally observable and and we can
talk more about that part of it but the

1648
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:34,720
talk more about that part of it but the
 

1649
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,549
talk more about that part of it but the
point i want to make about it is there

1650
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:36,559
point i want to make about it is there
 

1651
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,950
point i want to make about it is there
was always this intuition that i had

1652
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:38,960
was always this intuition that i had
 

1653
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,630
was always this intuition that i had
that there should be some complexity

1654
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:40,640
that there should be some complexity
 

1655
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,789
that there should be some complexity
threshold in the universe above which

1656
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:42,799
threshold in the universe above which
 

1657
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,710
threshold in the universe above which
you would start to say whatever physics

1658
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:44,720
you would start to say whatever physics
 

1659
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,789
you would start to say whatever physics
governs life actually becomes operative

1660
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:46,799
governs life actually becomes operative
 

1661
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,149
governs life actually becomes operative
and i think about it a little bit like

1662
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:48,159
and i think about it a little bit like
 

1663
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,310
and i think about it a little bit like
we have planks constant which you know

1664
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:50,320
we have planks constant which you know
 

1665
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,310
we have planks constant which you know
and we have the fine structure constant

1666
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:52,320
and we have the fine structure constant
 

1667
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,549
and we have the fine structure constant
and then this sort of assembly threshold

1668
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:54,559
and then this sort of assembly threshold
 

1669
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:55,750
and then this sort of assembly threshold
is basically

1670
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:55,760
is basically
 

1671
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,350
is basically
another sort of

1672
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,360
another sort of
 

1673
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,830
another sort of
uh potentially constant of nature it

1674
00:26:59,830 --> 00:26:59,840
uh potentially constant of nature it
 

1675
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,669
uh potentially constant of nature it
might depend on specific features of the

1676
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:01,679
might depend on specific features of the
 

1677
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,669
might depend on specific features of the
system like but um which we debate about

1678
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:03,679
system like but um which we debate about
 

1679
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,669
system like but um which we debate about
sometimes but um

1680
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:05,679
sometimes but um
 

1681
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,230
sometimes but um
but then when you're past that you have

1682
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:08,240
but then when you're past that you have
 

1683
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,909
but then when you're past that you have
you have to have some other explanation

1684
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:09,919
you have to have some other explanation
 

1685
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,190
you have to have some other explanation
than the current explanations we have in

1686
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:11,200
than the current explanations we have in
 

1687
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,310
than the current explanations we have in
physics because now you're in high

1688
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:12,320
physics because now you're in high
 

1689
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,149
physics because now you're in high
memory um

1690
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:14,159
memory um
 

1691
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,350
memory um
uh the things actually require time for

1692
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:17,360
uh the things actually require time for
 

1693
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,110
uh the things actually require time for
them to exist and time becomes a

1694
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,120
them to exist and time becomes a
 

1695
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,110
them to exist and time becomes a
physical variable the the path to the

1696
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,120
physical variable the the path to the
 

1697
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,430
physical variable the the path to the
creation of the object is the memory

1698
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:23,440
creation of the object is the memory
 

1699
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,590
creation of the object is the memory
yeah so you need to consider that

1700
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:25,600
yeah so you need to consider that
 

1701
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,430
yeah so you need to consider that
yeah but the but the point is that's a

1702
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:27,440
yeah but the but the point is that's a
 

1703
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,430
yeah but the but the point is that's a
feature of the object

1704
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:29,440
feature of the object
 

1705
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,070
feature of the object
so it's it's it so when i think of all

1706
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:32,080
so it's it's it so when i think of all
 

1707
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,630
so it's it's it so when i think of all
the things in this room uh you know we

1708
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:34,640
the things in this room uh you know we
 

1709
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,710
the things in this room uh you know we
see the the projection of them as a

1710
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:36,720
see the the projection of them as a
 

1711
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,389
see the the projection of them as a
water bottle but assembly theory would

1712
00:27:38,389 --> 00:27:38,399
water bottle but assembly theory would
 

1713
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,909
water bottle but assembly theory would
say that this is a causal graph of all

1714
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:39,919
say that this is a causal graph of all
 

1715
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,269
say that this is a causal graph of all
the ways the universe can create this

1716
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:41,279
the ways the universe can create this
 

1717
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,430
the ways the universe can create this
thing that's what it is as an object and

1718
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:43,440
thing that's what it is as an object and
 

1719
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,510
thing that's what it is as an object and
we're all interacting uh causal graphs

1720
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:45,520
we're all interacting uh causal graphs
 

1721
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,789
we're all interacting uh causal graphs
and most of the creativity in the

1722
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:46,799
and most of the creativity in the
 

1723
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,630
and most of the creativity in the
biosphere is because a lot of the

1724
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:48,640
biosphere is because a lot of the
 

1725
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,029
biosphere is because a lot of the
objects that exist now are huge in their

1726
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:51,039
objects that exist now are huge in their
 

1727
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,110
objects that exist now are huge in their

of evolution to get to us

1730
00:27:55,269 --> 00:27:55,279
of evolution to get to us
 

1731
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,430
of evolution to get to us
is it possible to look at me

1732
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:57,440
is it possible to look at me
 

1733
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,310
is it possible to look at me
and

1734
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:58,320
and
 

1735
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,789
and
infer the history that led to me

1736
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:02,799

 

1737
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,190

you as an individual might be hard you

1738
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:05,200
you as an individual might be hard you
 

1739
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,549
you as an individual might be hard you
as a representative of a population of

1740
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:08,559
as a representative of a population of
 

1741
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,149
as a representative of a population of
objects that have high assembly with

1742
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:10,159
objects that have high assembly with
 

1743
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,070
objects that have high assembly with
similar causal history and structure

1744
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:12,080
similar causal history and structure
 

1745
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,750
similar causal history and structure
that you can communicate with i.e other

1746
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:13,760
that you can communicate with i.e other
 

1747
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,830
that you can communicate with i.e other
humans you can refer a lot probably yeah

1748
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:15,840
humans you can refer a lot probably yeah
 

1749
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,350
humans you can refer a lot probably yeah
we'll stay with them which we do

1750
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:17,360
we'll stay with them which we do
 

1751
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,190
we'll stay with them which we do
genomically even i mean it's not like

1752
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,200
genomically even i mean it's not like
 

1753
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,630
genomically even i mean it's not like
like we have a lot of information and

1754
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:20,640
like we have a lot of information and
 

1755
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,950
like we have a lot of information and
that's we can reconstruct histories from

1756
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:22,960
that's we can reconstruct histories from
 

1757
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,070
that's we can reconstruct histories from
assembly is saying something slightly

1758
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,080
assembly is saying something slightly
 

1759
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,750
assembly is saying something slightly
deeper yeah one thing to add i mean it's

1760
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:25,760
deeper yeah one thing to add i mean it's
 

1761
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,029
deeper yeah one thing to add i mean it's
not just about the object but the

1762
00:28:27,029 --> 00:28:27,039
not just about the object but the
 

1763
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,029
not just about the object but the
objects occur and not just objects for a

1764
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:29,039
objects occur and not just objects for a
 

1765
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,110
objects occur and not just objects for a
high assembly number because you can

1766
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:31,120
high assembly number because you can
 

1767
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,310
high assembly number because you can
have random things that have a high

1768
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:32,320
have random things that have a high
 

1769
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,149
have random things that have a high
assembly number they must have there

1770
00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:34,159
assembly number they must have there
 

1771
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,389
assembly number they must have there
must be a number of identical copies so

1772
00:28:36,389 --> 00:28:36,399
must be a number of identical copies so
 

1773
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,590
must be a number of identical copies so
you know you're getting getting away

1774
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:37,600
you know you're getting getting away
 

1775
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,430
you know you're getting getting away
from the random because you could take a

1776
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:39,440
from the random because you could take a
 

1777
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,350
from the random because you could take a
snapshot this is why it's not i hate

1778
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:41,360
snapshot this is why it's not i hate
 

1779
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,430
snapshot this is why it's not i hate
entropy i love entropy when used

1780
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:43,440
entropy i love entropy when used
 

1781
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,510
entropy i love entropy when used
correctly but it's about the problem of

1782
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:45,520
correctly but it's about the problem of
 

1783
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,909
correctly but it's about the problem of
entropy you have to have a labeler and

1784
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:47,919
entropy you have to have a labeler and
 

1785
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,990
entropy you have to have a labeler and
so so you can label the beginning and

1786
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,000
so so you can label the beginning and
 

1787
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,149
so so you can label the beginning and
the end to start and the finish you know

1788
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:52,159
the end to start and the finish you know
 

1789
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,990
the end to start and the finish you know
what you can do in assembly is say oh i

1790
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,000
what you can do in assembly is say oh i
 

1791
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,710
what you can do in assembly is say oh i
have

1792
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:54,720
have
 

1793
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,549
have
a number of objects in abundance they

1794
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:56,559
a number of objects in abundance they
 

1795
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,630
a number of objects in abundance they
all have these features and then you can

1796
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:58,640
all have these features and then you can
 

1797
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,830
all have these features and then you can
infer

1798
00:28:59,830 --> 00:28:59,840
infer
 

1799
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,350
infer
and one of the things that we debated a

1800
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:01,360
and one of the things that we debated a
 

1801
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,950
and one of the things that we debated a
lot particularly during lockdown because

1802
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:02,960
lot particularly during lockdown because
 

1803
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,350
lot particularly during lockdown because
i almost went insane trying to crush the

1804
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:05,360
i almost went insane trying to crush the
 

1805
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,029
i almost went insane trying to crush the
produce the assembly equation so we came

1806
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:07,039
produce the assembly equation so we came
 

1807
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,350
produce the assembly equation so we came
up with the assembly equation i had just

1808
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:09,360
up with the assembly equation i had just
 

1809
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,430
up with the assembly equation i had just
imagine this so you have this string

1810
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:11,440
imagine this so you have this string
 

1811
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,549
imagine this so you have this string
where

1812
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:12,559
where
 

1813
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,669
where
oh

1814
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:13,679
oh
 

1815
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,190
oh
actually it makes me makes me sick

1816
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:15,200
actually it makes me makes me sick
 

1817
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,110
actually it makes me makes me sick
trying to remember it was so it did my

1818
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:17,120
trying to remember it was so it did my
 

1819
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,190
trying to remember it was so it did my
head in for a long time

1820
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:19,200
head in for a long time
 

1821
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,510
head in for a long time
yeah because i couldn't

1822
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:21,520
yeah because i couldn't
 

1823
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,190
yeah because i couldn't
so if you just have a string of say

1824
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:23,200
so if you just have a string of say
 

1825
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,750
so if you just have a string of say
words say you know a series of words

1826
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:25,760
words say you know a series of words
 

1827
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,909
words say you know a series of words
series of letters so you just have a aaa

1828
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:27,919
series of letters so you just have a aaa
 

1829
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,789
series of letters so you just have a aaa
bbb ccc ddd and you and you find that

1830
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:30,799
bbb ccc ddd and you and you find that
 

1831
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,389
bbb ccc ddd and you and you find that
object and you just just have four a's

1832
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:32,399
object and you just just have four a's
 

1833
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,269
object and you just just have four a's
four b's four c's four d's together boom

1834
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:35,279
four b's four c's four d's together boom
 

1835
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,230
four b's four c's four d's together boom
then

1836
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:36,240
then
 

1837
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,990
then
and that really that you measured that

1838
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:38,000
and that really that you measured that
 

1839
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,510
and that really that you measured that
you physically measured that string of

1840
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:39,520
you physically measured that string of
 

1841
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,549
you physically measured that string of
letters

1842
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:40,559
letters
 

1843
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,710
letters
then what you could do is you can infer

1844
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:42,720
then what you could do is you can infer
 

1845
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,590
then what you could do is you can infer
sub

1846
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:43,600
sub
 

1847
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,230
sub
graphs of maybe the four a's the four

1848
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:46,240

1849
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,990
graphs of maybe the four a's the four
b's the four c's and four c's we don't

1850
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,000
b's the four c's and four c's we don't
 

1851
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,029
b's the four c's and four c's we don't
see them

1852
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:49,039
see them
 

1853
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,190
see them
in the real world you just infer them

1854
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:51,200
in the real world you just infer them
 

1855
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,909
in the real world you just infer them
and i really got stuck with that because

1856
00:29:53,909 --> 00:29:53,919
and i really got stuck with that because
 

1857
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,510
and i really got stuck with that because
there's a problem to try and work out

1858
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:55,520
there's a problem to try and work out
 

1859
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,510
there's a problem to try and work out
what's the difference between a long

1860
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:57,520
what's the difference between a long
 

1861
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,470
what's the difference between a long
you know

1862
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:58,480
you know
 

1863
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,710
you know
a physical object in this assembly space

1864
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:00,720
a physical object in this assembly space
 

1865
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,029
a physical object in this assembly space
of objects that we realized the best way

1866
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:03,039
of objects that we realized the best way
 

1867
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,909
of objects that we realized the best way
to put that is infer in time that so

1868
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:05,919
to put that is infer in time that so
 

1869
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,590
to put that is infer in time that so
although we can't infer your entire

1870
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:07,600
although we can't infer your entire
 

1871
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,350
although we can't infer your entire
history we know at some point the four

1872
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:09,360
history we know at some point the four
 

1873
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,669
history we know at some point the four
a's were made the four b's was made the

1874
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:11,679
a's were made the four b's was made the
 

1875
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,669
a's were made the four b's was made the
four c's were made in four d's were made

1876
00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:13,679
four c's were made in four d's were made
 

1877
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,830
four c's were made in four d's were made
and they all got added together and and

1878
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:15,840
and they all got added together and and
 

1879
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,430
and they all got added together and and
that's one really interesting thing

1880
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:17,440
that's one really interesting thing
 

1881
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,669
that's one really interesting thing
that's come out the theory about the the

1882
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:19,679
that's come out the theory about the the
 

1883
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,230
that's come out the theory about the the
killer when we knew we were going beyond

1884
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:22,240
killer when we knew we were going beyond
 

1885
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,110
killer when we knew we were going beyond
um

1886
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,120
um
 

1887
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,070
um
and

1888
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:24,080
and
 

1889
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,389
and
beyond standard complexity theories was

1890
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:26,399
beyond standard complexity theories was
 

1891
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,549
beyond standard complexity theories was
incredibly successful

1892
00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:28,559
incredibly successful
 

1893
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,549
incredibly successful
is that we realized we could start to

1894
00:30:30,549 --> 00:30:30,559
is that we realized we could start to
 

1895
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,230
is that we realized we could start to
measure these things for real across

1896
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:32,240
measure these things for real across
 

1897
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,350
measure these things for real across
domains

1898
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:33,360
domains
 

1899
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,430
domains
so the assembly index is actually an

1900
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:35,440
so the assembly index is actually an
 

1901
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,750
so the assembly index is actually an
intrinsic property of all stuff that you

1902
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:37,760
intrinsic property of all stuff that you
 

1903
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,590
intrinsic property of all stuff that you
can break into

1904
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:39,600
can break into
 

1905
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,590
can break into
components

1906
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:41,600
components
 

1907
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,110
components
particularly molecules are good because

1908
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,120
particularly molecules are good because
 

1909
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,110
particularly molecules are good because
you can break them up into smaller

1910
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,120
you can break them up into smaller
 

1911
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,110
you can break them up into smaller
molecules into atoms

1912
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:47,120
molecules into atoms
 

1913
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,430
molecules into atoms
the challenge will be making that more

1914
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:49,440
the challenge will be making that more
 

1915
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,870
the challenge will be making that more
general across all the domains but we're

1916
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:50,880
general across all the domains but we're
 

1917
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,070
general across all the domains but we're
working on it right now and i think the

1918
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:52,080
working on it right now and i think the
 

1919
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,750
working on it right now and i think the
theory will do that so components

1920
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:53,760
theory will do that so components
 

1921
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,510
theory will do that so components
domains so

1922
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:55,520
domains so
 

1923
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,990
domains so
you're talking about basically measuring

1924
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,000
you're talking about basically measuring
 

1925
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,149
you're talking about basically measuring
the complexity of an object

1926
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:00,159
the complexity of an object
 

1927
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,269
the complexity of an object
in what biology chemistry physics that's

1928
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:03,279
in what biology chemistry physics that's
 

1929
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,269
in what biology chemistry physics that's
what you mean by domains

1930
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:05,279
what you mean by domains
 

1931
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,990
what you mean by domains
uh like if tesla's sociology computers

1932
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,000
uh like if tesla's sociology computers
 

1933
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,669
uh like if tesla's sociology computers
complexity of memes

1934
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:09,679
complexity of memes
 

1935
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,590
complexity of memes
you know memes yep

1936
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:11,600
you know memes yep
 

1937
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,789
you know memes yep
what was that ideas yeah i mean so

1938
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:14,799
what was that ideas yeah i mean so
 

1939
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,070
what was that ideas yeah i mean so
one of the ideas are objects and

1940
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,080
one of the ideas are objects and
 

1941
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,870
one of the ideas are objects and
assemblies areas

1942
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:18,880
assemblies areas
 

1943
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,990
assemblies areas
they're just pictures of the causal

1944
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,000
they're just pictures of the causal
 

1945
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,750
they're just pictures of the causal
graph i mean the fact i can talk to you

1946
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:21,760
graph i mean the fact i can talk to you
 

1947
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,269
graph i mean the fact i can talk to you
right now is because we're exchanging

1948
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:23,279
right now is because we're exchanging
 

1949
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,149
right now is because we're exchanging
structure of our assembly space

1950
00:31:26,149 --> 00:31:26,159
structure of our assembly space
 

1951
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,110
structure of our assembly space
uh

1952
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,120
uh
 

1953
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,750
uh
so conversation is the

1954
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:29,760
so conversation is the
 

1955
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,630
so conversation is the
uh

1956
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:30,640
uh
 

1957
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,190
uh
exchanging structures in assembly space

1958
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:33,200
exchanging structures in assembly space
 

1959
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,950
exchanging structures in assembly space
what is assembly space

1960
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:34,960
what is assembly space
 

1961
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,389
what is assembly space
when i started working on origins of

1962
00:31:36,389 --> 00:31:36,399
when i started working on origins of
 

1963
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,470
when i started working on origins of
life i um i was writing about something

1964
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:38,480
life i um i was writing about something
 

1965
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,070

called top down causation which a lot of

00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:40,080
called top down causation which a lot of

like philosophers philosophers are

1968
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:41,600
like philosophers philosophers are
 

1969
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,710
like philosophers philosophers are
interested in and people that worry

1970
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:42,720
interested in and people that worry
 

1971
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,230
interested in and people that worry
about the mind body problem but the

1972
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:44,240
about the mind body problem but the
 

1973
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,669
about the mind body problem but the
whole idea is you know if we have um you

1974
00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:47,679
whole idea is you know if we have um you
 

1975
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,990
whole idea is you know if we have um you
know the microscopic world of physics is

1976
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:50,000
know the microscopic world of physics is
 

1977
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,590
know the microscopic world of physics is
causally complete it seems like there's

1978
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:51,600
causally complete it seems like there's
 

1979
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,070
causally complete it seems like there's
no room for higher level causes like

1980
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:54,080
no room for higher level causes like
 

1981
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,990
no room for higher level causes like
our thoughts to actually have any impact

1982
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:56,000
our thoughts to actually have any impact
 

1983
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,389
our thoughts to actually have any impact
on the world and that didn't that seems

1984
00:31:58,389 --> 00:31:58,399
on the world and that didn't that seems
 

1985
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,630
on the world and that didn't that seems
problematic when you get to studying

1986
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:00,640
problematic when you get to studying
 

1987
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,789
problematic when you get to studying
life in mind because it does seem that

1988
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:02,799
life in mind because it does seem that

00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,470
life in mind because it does seem that
quote-unquote emergent properties do

1990
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:04,480
quote-unquote emergent properties do
 

1991
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,909
quote-unquote emergent properties do
matter to matter

1992
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:05,919
matter to matter
 

1993
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,909
matter to matter
um and so

1994
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:07,919
um and so
 

1995
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:08,870
um and so
um

1996
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:08,880
um
 

1997
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,990
um
and then there's this other sort of

1998
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:10,000
and then there's this other sort of
 

1999
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,750
and then there's this other sort of
paradoxical situation where information

2000
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:11,760
paradoxical situation where information
 

2001
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,430
paradoxical situation where information
looks like it's disembodied so we talk

2002
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:13,440
looks like it's disembodied so we talk
 

2003
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,110
looks like it's disembodied so we talk
about information like it can just move

2004
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,120
about information like it can just move
 

2005
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,630
about information like it can just move
from any physical system to any other

2006
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:16,640
from any physical system to any other
 

2007
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,509
from any physical system to any other
physical system and it doesn't require

2008
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:19,519
physical system and it doesn't require
 

2009
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,590
physical system and it doesn't require
um like you don't have to specify

2010
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:21,600
um like you don't have to specify
 

2011
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,950
um like you don't have to specify
anything about the substrate to talk

2012
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:22,960
anything about the substrate to talk
 

2013
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,110
anything about the substrate to talk
about information and then there's als

2014
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:25,120
about information and then there's als
 

2015
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,350
about information and then there's als
also the way we talk about mathematics

2016
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:27,360
also the way we talk about mathematics
 

2017
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,110
also the way we talk about mathematics
is also disembodied right like the

2018
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,120
is also disembodied right like the
 

2019
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,630
is also disembodied right like the
platonic world of forms and i think all

2020
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:32,640
platonic world of forms and i think all
 

2021
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,630
platonic world of forms and i think all
of those things are

2022
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:34,640
of those things are
 

2023
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,990
of those things are
hinting that we really don't know how to

2024
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,000
hinting that we really don't know how to
 

2025
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,750
hinting that we really don't know how to
think about abstractions as physical

2026
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:37,760
think about abstractions as physical
 

2027
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,789
think about abstractions as physical
things

2028
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:38,799
things
 

2029
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:39,669
things
um

2030
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:39,679
um
 

2031
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:40,870
um
and

2032
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:40,880
and
 

2033
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,350
and
really i think what assembly theory is

2034
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:43,360
really i think what assembly theory is
 

2035
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,950
really i think what assembly theory is
pointing to is what we're missing there

2036
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:44,960
pointing to is what we're missing there
 

2037
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,950
pointing to is what we're missing there
is the dimension of time

2038
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:46,960
is the dimension of time
 

2039
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,950
is the dimension of time
and if you actually look at an object

2040
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:48,960
and if you actually look at an object
 

2041
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,350
and if you actually look at an object
being extended across time

2042
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:51,360
being extended across time
 

2043
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,190
being extended across time
what we call information and the things

2044
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:53,200
what we call information and the things
 

2045
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,110
what we call information and the things
that look abstract are things that are

2046
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:55,120
that look abstract are things that are
 

2047
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,630
that look abstract are things that are
entangled in the histories of those

2048
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:56,640
entangled in the histories of those
 

2049
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,149
entangled in the histories of those
objects they're features of the

2050
00:32:58,149 --> 00:32:58,159
objects they're features of the
 

2051
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,549
objects they're features of the
overlapping assembly space so they look

2052
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:00,559
overlapping assembly space so they look
 

2053
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,310
overlapping assembly space so they look
abstract because they're not

2054
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:02,320
abstract because they're not
 

2055
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,549
abstract because they're not
you know part of the current

2056
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:04,559
you know part of the current
 

2057
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,230
you know part of the current
structure but they're part of the

2058
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:06,240
structure but they're part of the
 

2059
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,830
structure but they're part of the
structure if you thought about it as

2060
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:07,840
structure if you thought about it as
 

2061
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,269
structure if you thought about it as
like the philosophical concept of a

2062
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:09,279
like the philosophical concept of a
 

2063
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,110
like the philosophical concept of a
hyper object an object that's too big in

2064
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:11,120
hyper object an object that's too big in
 

2065
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,830
hyper object an object that's too big in
time for us to actually to resolve

2066
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:13,840
time for us to actually to resolve
 

2067
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,909
time for us to actually to resolve
and so i think information is physical

2068
00:33:15,909 --> 00:33:15,919
and so i think information is physical
 

2069
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,029
and so i think information is physical
it's just physical in time not in space

2070
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:19,039
it's just physical in time not in space
 

2071
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:19,750
it's just physical in time not in space
too

2072
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:19,760
too
 

2073
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,750
too
hyper object too difficult for us to

2074
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:21,760
hyper object too difficult for us to
 

2075
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,789
hyper object too difficult for us to
resolve so we're supposed to think about

2076
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:24,799
resolve so we're supposed to think about
 

2077
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,070
resolve so we're supposed to think about
of life

2078
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,080
of life
 

2079
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,750
of life
as this thing that stretches through

2080
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:27,760
as this thing that stretches through
 

2081
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,909
as this thing that stretches through
time and there's a causation chain that

2082
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:29,919
time and there's a causation chain that
 

2083
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,230
time and there's a causation chain that
led to that thing

2084
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:32,240
led to that thing
 

2085
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,990
led to that thing
and then you're trying to measure

2086
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:34,000
and then you're trying to measure
 

2087
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,870
and then you're trying to measure
something with the assembly index about

2088
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:36,880
something with the assembly index about
 

2089
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,029
something with the assembly index about
the assembly index is the ordering the

2090
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:39,039
the assembly index is the ordering the
 

2091
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,029
the assembly index is the ordering the
or like um you could think of it as like

2092
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:41,039
or like um you could think of it as like
 

2093
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,389
or like um you could think of it as like
a partial ordering of all the things

2094
00:33:42,389 --> 00:33:42,399
a partial ordering of all the things
 

2095
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,509
a partial ordering of all the things
that can happen

2096
00:33:43,509 --> 00:33:43,519
that can happen
 

2097
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,669
that can happen
um so in in thermodynamics we course

2098
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:45,679
um so in in thermodynamics we course
 

2099
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,149
um so in in thermodynamics we course
grain things by temperature and pressure

2100
00:33:48,149 --> 00:33:48,159
grain things by temperature and pressure
 

2101
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,789
grain things by temperature and pressure
in assembly theory we coarse grain by

2102
00:33:50,789 --> 00:33:50,799
in assembly theory we coarse grain by
 

2103
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,389
in assembly theory we coarse grain by
the number of copies of an object and

2104
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:52,399
the number of copies of an object and
 

2105
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,070
the number of copies of an object and
the assembly index which is basically if

2106
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:54,080
the assembly index which is basically if
 

2107
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,110
the assembly index which is basically if
you think about the space of all

2108
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:55,120
you think about the space of all
 

2109
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,190
you think about the space of all
possible things it's like a depth of how

2110
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:57,200
possible things it's like a depth of how
 

2111
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,630
possible things it's like a depth of how
far you've gone into that space and how

2112
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:58,640
far you've gone into that space and how
 

2113
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,549
far you've gone into that space and how
much time was required to get there in

2114
00:34:00,549 --> 00:34:00,559
much time was required to get there in
 

2115
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,990
much time was required to get there in
the shortest possible version

2116
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,000
the shortest possible version
 

2117
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,789
the shortest possible version
not

2118
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:04,799
not
 

2119
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,310
not
average because can't you just 3d

2120
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:08,320
average because can't you just 3d
 

2121
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,829
average because can't you just 3d
with that question oh not not not 3d

2122
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:11,839
with that question oh not not not 3d
 

2123
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,069
with that question oh not not not 3d
can't you always 3d print the thing in

2124
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:14,079
can't you always 3d print the thing in
 

2125
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,030
can't you always 3d print the thing in
the heart no because i had such fight so

2126
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:17,040
the heart no because i had such fight so

sarah's team and my team are writing

2128
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:18,399
sarah's team and my team are writing
 

2129
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,629
sarah's team and my team are writing
this paper at the moment and it's so

2130
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:20,639
this paper at the moment and it's so
 

2131
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,629
this paper at the moment and it's so
funny i think we kind of share the at

2132
00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:22,639
funny i think we kind of share the at
 

2133
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,669
funny i think we kind of share the at
the beginning you were like no that's

2134
00:34:23,669 --> 00:34:23,679
the beginning you were like no that's
 

2135
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,190
the beginning you were like no that's
not right oh yes right and we're doing

2136
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:25,200
not right oh yes right and we're doing
 

2137
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,030
not right oh yes right and we're doing
this for a bit and then the problem is

2138
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:27,040
this for a bit and then the problem is
 

2139
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,990
this for a bit and then the problem is
when you build a theory and build the

2140
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:28,000
when you build a theory and build the
 

2141
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,190
when you build a theory and build the
intuition

2142
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:29,200
intuition
 

2143
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,470
intuition
there's some certain

2144
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:30,480
there's some certain
 

2145
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,750
there's some certain
features right of the theory that almost

2146
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:33,760
features right of the theory that almost
 

2147
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,190
features right of the theory that almost

00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:35,200
felt like i was being religious about

brilliant they're brilliant but they
 

2161
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,270
brilliant they're brilliant but they
were like now we don't we don't buy that

2162
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:49,280
were like now we don't we don't buy that
 

2163
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,869
were like now we don't we don't buy that
and i was like

2164
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:50,879
and i was like
 

2165
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,030
and i was like
it is is they were like well lee

2166
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:53,040
it is is they were like well lee
 

2167
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,149
it is is they were like well lee
actually um

2168
00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:54,159
actually um
 

2169
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,510
actually um
i thought you're the first to say that

2170
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:55,520
i thought you're the first to say that
 

2171
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,349
i thought you're the first to say that
you know you can't if you can't explain

2172
00:34:57,349 --> 00:34:57,359
you know you can't if you can't explain
 

2173
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:58,470
you know you can't if you can't explain
it it doesn't and you can't do an

2174
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:58,480
it it doesn't and you can't do an
 

2175
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,390
it it doesn't and you can't do an
experiment that doesn't exist and that

2176
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:00,400
experiment that doesn't exist and that
 

2177
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,990
experiment that doesn't exist and that
saved me and i said to abhishek whoever

2178
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:02,000
saved me and i said to abhishek whoever
 

2179
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,150
saved me and i said to abhishek whoever
takes my postdoc in glasgow daniel was

2180
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:04,160
takes my postdoc in glasgow daniel was
 

2181
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,270
takes my postdoc in glasgow daniel was
sarah's postdoc in asu i was like

2182
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:07,280
sarah's postdoc in asu i was like
 

2183
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,270
sarah's postdoc in asu i was like
i have the experimental data so when i

2184
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:09,280
i have the experimental data so when i
 

2185
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,190
i have the experimental data so when i
basically take um the molecules and chop

2186
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:11,200
basically take um the molecules and chop
 

2187
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,190
basically take um the molecules and chop
them up in the mass spec the assembly

2188
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:13,200
them up in the mass spec the assembly
 

2189
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,950
them up in the mass spec the assembly
number is never the average it's always

2190
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:14,960
number is never the average it's always
 

2191
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,710
number is never the average it's always
the shortest it's an intrinsic property

2192
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:16,720
the shortest it's an intrinsic property
 

2193
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,150
the shortest it's an intrinsic property
and then the penny dropped for abhishek

2194
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:18,160
and then the penny dropped for abhishek
 

2195
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,470
and then the penny dropped for abhishek
said okay so i had these things that we

2196
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:20,480
said okay so i had these things that we
 

2197
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,510
said okay so i had these things that we
had to

2198
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:21,520
had to
 

2199
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,190
had to
believe to start with or to trust and

2200
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:23,200
believe to start with or to trust and
 

2201
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,550
believe to start with or to trust and
then we've done the math and it came out

2202
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:24,560
then we've done the math and it came out
 

2203
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,470
then we've done the math and it came out
and they now have the shortest path

2204
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:26,480
and they now have the shortest path
 

2205
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,069
and they now have the shortest path
actually it's up that explains why the

2206
00:35:28,069 --> 00:35:28,079
actually it's up that explains why the
 

2207
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,750
actually it's up that explains why the
shortest path here's why the shortest

2208
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:29,760
shortest path here's why the shortest
 

2209
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,470
shortest path here's why the shortest
path is important not the average

2210
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:32,480
path is important not the average
 

2211
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,550
path is important not the average
the shortest path needs you to identify

2212
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:34,560
the shortest path needs you to identify
 

2213
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,230
the shortest path needs you to identify
when the universe has basically got a

2214
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:36,240
when the universe has basically got a
 

2215
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,630
when the universe has basically got a
memory not an average so what you want

2216
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:38,640
memory not an average so what you want
 

2217
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,150
memory not an average so what you want
to do is to say

2218
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:40,160
to do is to say
 

2219
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,470
to do is to say
what is the minimum

2220
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:42,480
what is the minimum
 

2221
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,310
what is the minimum
number of features that i want to be

2222
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:44,320
number of features that i want to be
 

2223
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,990
number of features that i want to be
able to see in the universe when i find

2224
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:46,000
able to see in the universe when i find
 

2225
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,470
able to see in the universe when i find
those features i know the universe has

2226
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:48,480
those features i know the universe has
 

2227
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,710
those features i know the universe has
had a coherent memory

2228
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:50,720
had a coherent memory
 

2229
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,349
had a coherent memory
and it's basically a life

2230
00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:53,359
and it's basically a life
 

2231
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,109
and it's basically a life
and and so

2232
00:35:55,109 --> 00:35:55,119
and and so
 

2233
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,790
and and so
that means it gives you the lower bound

2234
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:56,800
that means it gives you the lower bound
 

2235
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,470
that means it gives you the lower bound
so that's like of course there's going

2236
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:58,480
so that's like of course there's going
 

2237
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,990
so that's like of course there's going
to be other paths we can be more

2238
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,000
to be other paths we can be more
 

2239
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,990
to be other paths we can be more
ridiculous right we can have other parts

2240
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:02,000
ridiculous right we can have other parts
 

2241
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,589
ridiculous right we can have other parts
but it's just the minimum so

2242
00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:03,599
but it's just the minimum so
 

2243
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,109
but it's just the minimum so
probabilistically

2244
00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:05,119
probabilistically
 

2245
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,270
probabilistically
at the beginning because assembly theory

2246
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:07,280
at the beginning because assembly theory
 

2247
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,990
at the beginning because assembly theory
was built as a measure for biosignatures

2248
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:10,000
was built as a measure for biosignatures
 

2249
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,670
was built as a measure for biosignatures
i needed to go there

2250
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:11,680
i needed to go there
 

2251
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,750
i needed to go there
and then i realized it was intrinsic and

2252
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:13,760
and then i realized it was intrinsic and
 

2253
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,670
and then i realized it was intrinsic and
then sarah realized it was intrinsic and

2254
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:15,680
then sarah realized it was intrinsic and
 

2255
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,950
then sarah realized it was intrinsic and
these hyper objects were coming and we

2256
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:16,960
these hyper objects were coming and we
 

2257
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,710
these hyper objects were coming and we
were kind of fusing that notions

2258
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:18,720
were kind of fusing that notions
 

2259
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,950
were kind of fusing that notions
together and then the team were like

2260
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:20,960
together and then the team were like
 

2261
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,310
together and then the team were like
yeah but

2262
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:22,320
yeah but
 

2263
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,230
yeah but
if i have enough energy and i have

2264
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:24,240
if i have enough energy and i have
 

2265
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,310
if i have enough energy and i have
enough resources i might not take the

2266
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:26,320
enough resources i might not take the
 

2267
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,069
enough resources i might not take the
shortest path i might go a bit longer i

2268
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:28,079
shortest path i might go a bit longer i
 

2269
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,150
shortest path i might go a bit longer i
might take a really long path because it

2270
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,160
might take a really long path because it
 

2271
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,910
might take a really long path because it
allows me then to

2272
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:31,920
allows me then to
 

2273
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,750
allows me then to
to do something else so what you do is

2274
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:33,760
to do something else so what you do is
 

2275
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,910
to do something else so what you do is
let's say i've got two different objects

2276
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:35,920
let's say i've got two different objects
 

2277
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,349
let's say i've got two different objects
a and b

2278
00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:37,359
a and b
 

2279
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,190
a and b
and they both have different shortest

2280
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:39,200
and they both have different shortest
 

2281
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,270
and they both have different shortest
paths to get them but then if you want

2282
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:41,280
paths to get them but then if you want
 

2283
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,750
paths to get them but then if you want
to make a and b together

2284
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:43,760
to make a and b together
 

2285
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,109
to make a and b together
they will have a compromise so in the

2286
00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:45,119
they will have a compromise so in the
 

2287
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,790
they will have a compromise so in the
joint assembly space

2288
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:46,800
joint assembly space
 

2289
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,710
joint assembly space
they might that might be an average but

2290
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:48,720
they might that might be an average but
 

2291
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,390
they might that might be an average but
actually it's the shortest way you can

2292
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:50,400
actually it's the shortest way you can
 

2293
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,150
actually it's the shortest way you can
make both a and b

2294
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:52,160
make both a and b
 

2295
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,910
make both a and b
with a minimum amount of resource in

2296
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:53,920
with a minimum amount of resource in
 

2297
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,910
with a minimum amount of resource in
time so suddenly you then layer these

2298
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:55,920
time so suddenly you then layer these
 

2299
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,790
time so suddenly you then layer these
things up and so the average becomes not

2300
00:36:58,790 --> 00:36:58,800
things up and so the average becomes not
 

2301
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,630
things up and so the average becomes not
important but it's a

2302
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:00,640
important but it's a
 

2303
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,589
important but it's a
as you

2304
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:01,599
as you
 

2305
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,069
as you
literally overlap those sets you get a

2306
00:37:04,069 --> 00:37:04,079
literally overlap those sets you get a
 

2307
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,310
literally overlap those sets you get a
new shortest path and so what we realize

2308
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:06,320
new shortest path and so what we realize
 

2309
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,510
new shortest path and so what we realize
time and time again when we're doing the

2310
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:07,520
time and time again when we're doing the
 

2311
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,230
time and time again when we're doing the
math the shortest path is intrinsic is

2312
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:10,240
math the shortest path is intrinsic is
 

2313
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,790
math the shortest path is intrinsic is
fundamental and is measurable which is

2314
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:12,800
fundamental and is measurable which is
 

2315
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,710
fundamental and is measurable which is
kind of mind-blowing so what we're

2316
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:14,720
kind of mind-blowing so what we're
 

2317
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,829
kind of mind-blowing so what we're
talking about

2318
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:15,839
talking about
 

2319
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,230
talking about
some basic ingredients so maybe

2320
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:18,240
some basic ingredients so maybe
 

2321
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,069
some basic ingredients so maybe
we'll talk about that what those basic

2322
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:20,079
we'll talk about that what those basic
 

2323
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,630
we'll talk about that what those basic
ingredients could be and how many step

2324
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:22,640
ingredients could be and how many step
 

2325
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,150
ingredients could be and how many step
when you say shortest path how many

2326
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:24,160
when you say shortest path how many
 

2327
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,670
when you say shortest path how many
steps it takes

2328
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:25,680
steps it takes
 

2329
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,710
steps it takes
to turn those basic ingredients into the

2330
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:28,720
to turn those basic ingredients into the
 

2331
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,390
to turn those basic ingredients into the
final

2332
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:30,400
final
 

2333
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,990
final
meal

2334
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:32,000
meal
 

2335
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,670
meal
so how to make a p what's the shortest

2336
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:33,680
so how to make a p what's the shortest
 

2337
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,829
so how to make a p what's the shortest
way to make a

2338
00:37:34,829 --> 00:37:34,839
way to make a
 

2339
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:37,030
way to make a
pizza pie

2340
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:37,040
pizza pie
 

2341
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,030
pizza pie
an apple pie that's right

2342
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:39,040
an apple pie that's right
 

2343
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,030
an apple pie that's right
and a pizza and a pie together scratch

2344
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:41,040
and a pizza and a pie together scratch
 

2345
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,750
and a pizza and a pie together scratch
yeah uh so there's a lot of ways

2346
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:43,760
yeah uh so there's a lot of ways
 

2347
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,790
yeah uh so there's a lot of ways
um

2348
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:44,800
um
 

2349
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,950
um
there's the shortest way and then you

2350
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:46,960
there's the shortest way and then you
 

2351
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,790
there's the shortest way and then you
know you take the full spectrum of ways

2352
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:48,800
know you take the full spectrum of ways
 

2353
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,790
know you take the full spectrum of ways
and there's probably an average

2354
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:50,800
and there's probably an average
 

2355
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,270
and there's probably an average
uh like duration

2356
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:53,280
uh like duration
 

2357
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,310
uh like duration
for a noob to make an apple pie

2358
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:56,320
for a noob to make an apple pie
 

2359
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,470
for a noob to make an apple pie
is the average interesting still if you

2360
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:58,480
is the average interesting still if you
 

2361
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,670
is the average interesting still if you
measure the

2362
00:37:59,670 --> 00:37:59,680
measure the
 

2363
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,630
measure the
average length of the path to assemble a

2364
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:02,640
average length of the path to assemble a
 

2365
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,589
average length of the path to assemble a
thing

2366
00:38:03,589 --> 00:38:03,599
thing
 

2367
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,349
thing
does that tell you something about the

2368
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:05,359
does that tell you something about the
 

2369
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,630
does that tell you something about the
way nature usually does it

2370
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:08,640
way nature usually does it
 

2371
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,230
way nature usually does it
versus

2372
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:10,240
versus
 

2373
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,230
versus
um

2374
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:12,240
um
 

2375
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,750
um
something fundamental about the object

2376
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:13,760
something fundamental about the object
 

2377
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,270
something fundamental about the object
which i think is what you're aiming at

2378
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:15,280
which i think is what you're aiming at
 

2379
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,510
which i think is what you're aiming at
with the assembly index yeah i mean look

2380
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:17,520
with the assembly index yeah i mean look
 

2381
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,430
with the assembly index yeah i mean look
we all love to quantify things the

2382
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:19,440
we all love to quantify things the
 

2383
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,030
we all love to quantify things the
minimum path gives you the lower bounce

2384
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:21,040
minimum path gives you the lower bounce
 

2385
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,310
minimum path gives you the lower bounce
you know you're detecting something you

2386
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:22,320
you know you're detecting something you
 

2387
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,069
you know you're detecting something you
know you're inferring something the

2388
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:24,079
know you're inferring something the
 

2389
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,069
know you're inferring something the
average tells you about really how the

2390
00:38:26,069 --> 00:38:26,079
average tells you about really how the
 

2391
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,550
average tells you about really how the
objects are are existing in the

00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:28,560
objects are are existing in the
 

2393
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,950
objects are are existing in the
ecosystem or the technology

2394
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:30,960
ecosystem or the technology
 

2395
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,030
ecosystem or the technology
and and that and though and there has to

2396
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:33,040
and and that and though and there has to
 

2397
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,349
and and that and though and there has to
be more paths explored because then you

2398
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:35,359
be more paths explored because then you
 

2399
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:36,150
be more paths explored because then you
can

2400
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:36,160
can
 

2401
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,910
can
um

2402
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:37,920
um
 

2403
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,150
um
happen upon other memories and then

2404
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:40,160
happen upon other memories and then
 

2405
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,990
happen upon other memories and then
condense them down i'm not making too

2406
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:42,000
condense them down i'm not making too
 

2407
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,069
condense them down i'm not making too
much sense but if you look at say let's

2408
00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:44,079
much sense but if you look at say let's
 

2409
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,510
much sense but if you look at say let's
just say i mean maybe we're going to get

2410
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:45,520
just say i mean maybe we're going to get
 

2411
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,589
just say i mean maybe we're going to get
to alien civilizations later right but i

2412
00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:47,599
to alien civilizations later right but i
 

2413
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,829
to alien civilizations later right but i
i would argue very strongly that alien

2414
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:49,839
i would argue very strongly that alien
 

2415
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,510
i would argue very strongly that alien
civilization a and alien civilization b

2416
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:53,520
civilization a and alien civilization b
 

2417
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,589
civilization a and alien civilization b
um they're different assembly spaces so

2418
00:38:55,589 --> 00:38:55,599
um they're different assembly spaces so
 

2419
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,870
um they're different assembly spaces so
they're kind of going to be a bit messed

2420
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:56,880
they're kind of going to be a bit messed
 

2421
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,190
they're kind of going to be a bit messed
up if they happen upon one another only

2422
00:38:59,190 --> 00:38:59,200
up if they happen upon one another only
 

2423
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,430
up if they happen upon one another only
when they find some joint overlap in

2424
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:01,440
when they find some joint overlap in
 

2425
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,030
when they find some joint overlap in
their technology because if aliens come

2426
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:03,040
their technology because if aliens come
 

2427
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,190
their technology because if aliens come
to us and we they don't share any of the

2428
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:05,200
to us and we they don't share any of the
 

2429
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,109
to us and we they don't share any of the
causal graph we've shown but hopefully

2430
00:39:07,109 --> 00:39:07,119
causal graph we've shown but hopefully
 

2431
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,109
causal graph we've shown but hopefully
they share the periodic table

2432
00:39:09,109 --> 00:39:09,119
they share the periodic table
 

2433
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,430
they share the periodic table
and some other and bonds and things that

2434
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:11,440
and some other and bonds and things that
 

2435
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,630
and some other and bonds and things that
we're going to have to really think

2436
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:12,640
we're going to have to really think
 

2437
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,670
we're going to have to really think
about the language to talk to us aliens

2438
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:15,680
about the language to talk to us aliens
 

2439
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,829
about the language to talk to us aliens
by inferring by using assembly theory to

2440
00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:17,839
by inferring by using assembly theory to
 

2441
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,109
by inferring by using assembly theory to
infer

2442
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:19,119
infer
 

2443
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,150
infer
um

2444
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:20,160
um
 

2445
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,310
um
the their language their technology and

2446
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:22,320
the their language their technology and
 

2447
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,670
the their language their technology and
other bits and bobs

2448
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:23,680
other bits and bobs
 

2449
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,270
other bits and bobs
and the shortest path will help you do

2450
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:25,280
and the shortest path will help you do
 

2451
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,750
and the shortest path will help you do
that quickly all right so all all aliens

2452
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:27,760
that quickly all right so all all aliens
 

2453
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,069
that quickly all right so all all aliens
in these causality graphs have a common

2454
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:30,079
in these causality graphs have a common
 

2455
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,510
in these causality graphs have a common
ancestor

2456
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:31,520
ancestor
 

2457
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,349
ancestor
in the if the building blocks are the

2458
00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:33,359
in the if the building blocks are the
 

2459
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,950
in the if the building blocks are the
same which means they live in the same

2460
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:34,960
same which means they live in the same
 

2461
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,030
same which means they live in the same
universe as us so this depends on how

2462
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:37,040
universe as us so this depends on how
 

2463
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,710
universe as us so this depends on how
far back in time you go though but the

2464
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:38,720
far back in time you go though but the
 

2465
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,349
far back in time you go though but the
universe has all the same building

2466
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:41,359
universe has all the same building
 

2467
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,990
universe has all the same building
blocks yeah and like we have to assume

2468
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:44,000
blocks yeah and like we have to assume
 

2469
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,670
blocks yeah and like we have to assume
that

2470
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:45,680
that
 

2471
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,829
that
so at least there's there's not

2472
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:47,839
so at least there's there's not
 

2473
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:51,109
so at least there's there's not
different classes of causality

2474
00:39:51,109 --> 00:39:51,119
different classes of causality
 

2475
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,550
different classes of causality
graphs

2476
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:52,560
graphs
 

2477
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,630

right no the universe doesn't just say

2478
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:54,640
right no the universe doesn't just say
 

2479
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,430
right no the universe doesn't just say
like

2480
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:55,440
like
 

2481
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,510
like
here you get the the red

00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:57,520
here you get the the red
 

2483
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,270
here you get the the red
causality gravity you get the blue one

2484
00:39:59,270 --> 00:39:59,280
causality gravity you get the blue one
 

2485
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,109
causality gravity you get the blue one
these basic ingredients and they're

2486
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:01,119
these basic ingredients and they're
 

2487
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,790
these basic ingredients and they're
geographically constrained or

2488
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:02,800
geographically constrained or
 

2489
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,710
geographically constrained or
constrained in space or time or

2490
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:04,720
constrained in space or time or
 

2491
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,990
constrained in space or time or
something like that

2492
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:06,000
something like that
 

2493
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,309
something like that
they're constrained in time because uh

2494
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:08,319
they're constrained in time because uh
 

2495
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,790
they're constrained in time because uh
only by the virtue of the fact that

2496
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:10,800
only by the virtue of the fact that
 

2497
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,710
only by the virtue of the fact that
um you need enough time to have passed

2498
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:12,720
um you need enough time to have passed
 

2499
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,470
um you need enough time to have passed
for some things to exist

2500
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:14,480
for some things to exist
 

2501
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,910
for some things to exist
so the universe has to be big enough in

2502
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:15,920
so the universe has to be big enough in
 

2503
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,670
so the universe has to be big enough in
time for some things so just so one

2504
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:17,680
time for some things so just so one
 

2505
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,109
time for some things so just so one
point on the shortest path versus the

2506
00:40:19,109 --> 00:40:19,119
point on the shortest path versus the
 

2507
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,470
point on the shortest path versus the
average path which i think will get to

2508
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:20,480
average path which i think will get to
 

2509
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,710
average path which i think will get to
this is um you had a nice way of saying

2510
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:22,720
this is um you had a nice way of saying
 

2511
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,550
this is um you had a nice way of saying
it's like the minimal compression is the

2512
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:24,560
it's like the minimal compression is the
 

2513
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,670
it's like the minimal compression is the
shortest path for the universe to

2514
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:25,680
shortest path for the universe to
 

2515
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,430
shortest path for the universe to
produce that but it's also like the

2516
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:27,440
produce that but it's also like the
 

2517
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,430
produce that but it's also like the
first time in the in the ordering of

2518
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:29,440
first time in the in the ordering of
 

2519
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,030
first time in the in the ordering of
events that you might expect to see that

2520
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:31,040
events that you might expect to see that
 

2521
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,390
events that you might expect to see that
object

2522
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:32,400
object
 

2523
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,630
object
but the average path tells you

2524
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:34,640
but the average path tells you
 

2525
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,150
but the average path tells you
um something about the actual steps that

2526
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:38,160
um something about the actual steps that
 

2527
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,069
um something about the actual steps that
were realized and that becomes an

2528
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:40,079
were realized and that becomes an
 

2529
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,430
were realized and that becomes an
emergent property of that object's

2530
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:41,440
emergent property of that object's
 

2531
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,910
emergent property of that object's
interaction with other objects so it's

2532
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:43,920
interaction with other objects so it's
 

2533
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,430
interaction with other objects so it's
not an intrinsic feature of that object

2534
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:45,440
not an intrinsic feature of that object
 

2535
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,109
not an intrinsic feature of that object
it's the future of the interactions with

2536
00:40:47,109 --> 00:40:47,119
it's the future of the interactions with
 

2537
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,950
it's the future of the interactions with
other things and so one of the nice

2538
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:48,960
other things and so one of the nice
 

2539
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,390
other things and so one of the nice
features of assembly is you've basically

2540
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:50,400
features of assembly is you've basically
 

2541
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,829
features of assembly is you've basically
gotten rid of you just look at the

2542
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:51,839
gotten rid of you just look at the
 

2543
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:53,270
gotten rid of you just look at the
things that exist and you've gotten rid

2544
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:53,280
things that exist and you've gotten rid
 

2545
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,510
things that exist and you've gotten rid
of the mechanisms for constructing them

2546
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:55,520
of the mechanisms for constructing them
 

2547
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,829
of the mechanisms for constructing them
in some sense like the machines are not

2548
00:40:57,829 --> 00:40:57,839
in some sense like the machines are not
 

2549
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,270
in some sense like the machines are not
um

2550
00:40:59,270 --> 00:40:59,280
um
 

2551
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,910
um
as important in the current construction

2552
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:01,920
as important in the current construction
 

2553
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,670
as important in the current construction
of the theory although i would like to

2554
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:03,680
of the theory although i would like to
 

2555
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,510
of the theory although i would like to
bridge it to some ideas about

2556
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:05,520
bridge it to some ideas about
 

2557
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,790
bridge it to some ideas about
constructors

2558
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:06,800
constructors
 

2559
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,910
constructors
um

2560
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:07,920
um
 

2561
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,870
um
but then

2562
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:08,880
but then
 

2563
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,870
but then
um you could only communicate with

2564
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:10,880
um you could only communicate with
 

2565
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,870
um you could only communicate with
things as as lee was saying if you have

2566
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:12,880
things as as lee was saying if you have
 

2567
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,589
things as as lee was saying if you have
some overlap in the past history so if

2568
00:41:15,589 --> 00:41:15,599
some overlap in the past history so if
 

2569
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,030
some overlap in the past history so if
you had an alien species that had

2570
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:17,040
you had an alien species that had
 

2571
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,950
you had an alien species that had
absolutely no overlap then there would

2572
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:18,960
absolutely no overlap then there would
 

2573
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,109
absolutely no overlap then there would
be no means of communication

2574
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:21,119
be no means of communication
 

2575
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,030
be no means of communication
but as we become

2576
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:23,040
but as we become
 

2577
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,309
but as we become
you know as we progress further and

2578
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:24,319
you know as we progress further and
 

2579
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:26,069
you know as we progress further and
further in time and more things become

2580
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:26,079
further in time and more things become
 

2581
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,390
further in time and more things become
possible because the assembly spaces are

2582
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:28,400
possible because the assembly spaces are
 

2583
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,470
possible because the assembly spaces are
larger because you can have a larger

2584
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:30,480
larger because you can have a larger
 

2585
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,710
larger because you can have a larger
assembly space in terms of index and

2586
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:32,720
assembly space in terms of index and
 

2587
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,150
assembly space in terms of index and
also just the size of the space because

2588
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:34,160
also just the size of the space because
 

2589
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,150
also just the size of the space because
it's exponentially growing

2590
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:36,160
it's exponentially growing
 

2591
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,430
it's exponentially growing
then more things can happen in the

2592
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:37,440
then more things can happen in the
 

2593
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,510
then more things can happen in the
future and the example i like to give is

2594
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:39,520
future and the example i like to give is
 

2595
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,750
future and the example i like to give is
actually um when we made first contact

2596
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:41,760
actually um when we made first contact
 

2597
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,550
actually um when we made first contact
with gravitational waves um because uh

2598
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:44,560
with gravitational waves um because uh
 

2599
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,910
with gravitational waves um because uh
you know that's an alien phenomena

2600
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:45,920
you know that's an alien phenomena
 

2601
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,270
you know that's an alien phenomena
that's been permeating our plate not

2602
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:47,280
that's been permeating our plate not
 

2603
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,589
that's been permeating our plate not
alien in life phenom by alien like

2604
00:41:49,589 --> 00:41:49,599
alien in life phenom by alien like
 

2605
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,990
alien in life phenom by alien like
something we had never knew existed it's

2606
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:52,000
something we had never knew existed it's
 

2607
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,670
something we had never knew existed it's
been you know like we're you know

2608
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:53,680
been you know like we're you know
 

2609
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,270
been you know like we're you know
there's gravitational waves rippling

2610
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:55,280
there's gravitational waves rippling
 

2611
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,670
there's gravitational waves rippling
through this room right now um but we

2612
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:57,680
through this room right now um but we
 

2613
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,069
through this room right now um but we
had to advance to the level of einstein

2614
00:42:00,069 --> 00:42:00,079
had to advance to the level of einstein
 

2615
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,270
had to advance to the level of einstein
writing down

2616
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:01,280
writing down
 

2617
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,069
writing down
um his theory of relativity and then 100

2618
00:42:04,069 --> 00:42:04,079
um his theory of relativity and then 100
 

2619
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,829
um his theory of relativity and then 100
years of technological development to

2620
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:05,839
years of technological development to
 

2621
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,390
years of technological development to
even quote unquote see that phenomena

2622
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:08,400
even quote unquote see that phenomena
 

2623
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,510
even quote unquote see that phenomena
so the

2624
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:09,520
so the
 

2625
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,990
so the
okay to see that phenomena

2626
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:12,000
okay to see that phenomena
 

2627
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,790
okay to see that phenomena
our

2628
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:12,800
our
 

2629
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,829
our
causal graph have to start

2630
00:42:14,829 --> 00:42:14,839
causal graph have to start
 

2631
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:17,190
causal graph have to start
intersecting yeah we needed the idea to

2632
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:17,200
intersecting yeah we needed the idea to
 

2633
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,950
intersecting yeah we needed the idea to
emerge first the abstraction right and

2634
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:18,960
emerge first the abstraction right and
 

2635
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,630
emerge first the abstraction right and
then we had to build the technology that

2636
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:20,640
then we had to build the technology that
 

2637
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,910
then we had to build the technology that
could actually

2638
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:21,920
could actually
 

2639
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,750
could actually
observe features of that abstraction so

2640
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:23,760
observe features of that abstraction so
 

2641
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,069
observe features of that abstraction so
the the nice promising thing is over

2642
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:26,079
the the nice promising thing is over
 

2643
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,069
the the nice promising thing is over
time the graph can grow so it can start

2644
00:42:28,069 --> 00:42:28,079
time the graph can grow so it can start
 

2645
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,910
time the graph can grow so it can start
overlapping eventually yeah so the

2646
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:29,920
overlapping eventually yeah so the
 

2647
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,670
overlapping eventually yeah so the
interesting feature of that graph is

2648
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:31,680
interesting feature of that graph is
 

2649
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,750
interesting feature of that graph is
there was an event you know 1.4 billion

2650
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:33,760
there was an event you know 1.4 billion
 

2651
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,910
there was an event you know 1.4 billion
years away of a black hole merger that

2652
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:35,920
years away of a black hole merger that
 

2653
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,349
years away of a black hole merger that
we detected on our detector and you know

2654
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:39,359
we detected on our detector and you know
 

2655
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,589
we detected on our detector and you know
now suddenly we're connected through

2656
00:42:41,589 --> 00:42:41,599
now suddenly we're connected through
 

2657
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,190
now suddenly we're connected through
this communication channel with this

2658
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:43,200
this communication channel with this
 

2659
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,510
this communication channel with this
distant event in our universe that you

2660
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:45,520
distant event in our universe that you
 

2661
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,510
distant event in our universe that you
know if you think about 1.4 billion

2662
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:47,520
know if you think about 1.4 billion
 

2663
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,790
know if you think about 1.4 billion
years ago what was happening on this

2664
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:48,800
years ago what was happening on this
 

2665
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,190
years ago what was happening on this
planet or even further back in time

2666
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:51,200
planet or even further back in time
 

2667
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,270
planet or even further back in time
um that you know there was common

2668
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:53,280
um that you know there was common
 

2669
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,109
um that you know there was common
physics underlying all those events but

2670
00:42:55,109 --> 00:42:55,119
physics underlying all those events but
 

2671
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:56,950
physics underlying all those events but
even for those two events to communicate

2672
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:56,960
even for those two events to communicate
 

2673
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,990
even for those two events to communicate
i understand what you were going on

2674
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:58,000
i understand what you were going on
 

2675
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,670
i understand what you were going on
about the other week yeah i'm sorry it's

2676
00:42:59,670 --> 00:42:59,680
about the other week yeah i'm sorry it's
 

2677
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,030
about the other week yeah i'm sorry it's
a really abstract example but um but

2678
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:03,040
a really abstract example but um but
 

2679
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,589
a really abstract example but um but
your causal graphs are not overlapping

2680
00:43:05,589 --> 00:43:05,599
your causal graphs are not overlapping
 

2681
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,510
your causal graphs are not overlapping
well let's just say now our causal

2682
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:07,520
well let's just say now our causal
 

2683
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:13,270
well let's just say now our causal
graphs are overlapping in the deep past

2684
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:13,280

 

2685
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,950

yeah you made a connection with it no i

2686
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:14,960
yeah you made a connection with it no i
 

2687
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,470
yeah you made a connection with it no i
do like that no no you can tell me what

2688
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:16,480
do like that no no you can tell me what
 

2689
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,710
do like that no no you can tell me what
your epiphany is now that's good because

2690
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:18,720
your epiphany is now that's good because
 

2691
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,470
your epiphany is now that's good because
i was and i should get the jokes before

2692
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:20,480
i was and i should get the jokes before
 

2693
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,710
i was and i should get the jokes before
30 seconds after

2694
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:22,720
30 seconds after
 

2695
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:28,550
30 seconds after
oh i get it now

2696
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:28,560

 

2697
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,990

i wasn't able to comprehend what you

2698
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:30,000
i wasn't able to comprehend what you
 

2699
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,349
i wasn't able to comprehend what you
were talking about with saying the

2700
00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:31,359
were talking about with saying the
 

2701
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,870
were talking about with saying the
channel communicating to the past but

2702
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:32,880
channel communicating to the past but
 

2703
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,550
channel communicating to the past but
what you're saying is

2704
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:34,560
what you're saying is
 

2705
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,670
what you're saying is
we were able to infer what happened

2706
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:37,680
we were able to infer what happened
 

2707
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,870
we were able to infer what happened
1.4 billion years ago we detected the

2708
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:40,880
1.4 billion years ago we detected the
 

2709
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,550
1.4 billion years ago we detected the
gravity wave i mean i think it's amazing

2710
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:42,560
gravity wave i mean i think it's amazing
 

2711
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,910
gravity wave i mean i think it's amazing
that you know at that time we weren't

2712
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:43,920
that you know at that time we weren't
 

2713
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,990
that you know at that time we weren't
even we were just becoming multicellular

2714
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:46,000
even we were just becoming multicellular
 

2715
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,349
even we were just becoming multicellular
right it's like insane and then we we we

2716
00:43:49,349 --> 00:43:49,359
right it's like insane and then we we we
 

2717
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,670
right it's like insane and then we we we
progress from multicellular clarity

2718
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:51,680
progress from multicellular clarity
 

2719
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,390
progress from multicellular clarity
through to technology technology

2720
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:54,400
through to technology technology
 

2721
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,150
through to technology technology
and build the detector and then for you

2722
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:56,160
and build the detector and then for you
 

2723
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,510
and build the detector and then for you
know and then we'll just extrapolate

2724
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:57,520
know and then we'll just extrapolate
 

2725
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,790
know and then we'll just extrapolate
backwards so

2726
00:43:58,790 --> 00:43:58,800
backwards so
 

2727
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,470
backwards so
so i although we haven't didn't do

2728
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:00,480
so i although we haven't didn't do
 

2729
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,069
so i although we haven't didn't do
anything back to the graph back in time

2730
00:44:02,069 --> 00:44:02,079
anything back to the graph back in time
 

2731
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,430
anything back to the graph back in time
we understood his existence then

2732
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:03,440
we understood his existence then
 

2733
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,870
we understood his existence then
overlapped going forward and that well

2734
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:04,880
overlapped going forward and that well
 

2735
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,470
overlapped going forward and that well
that's because our graphs are larger

2736
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:06,480
that's because our graphs are larger
 

2737
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,990
that's because our graphs are larger
yeah but that means that has a that has

2738
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:08,000
yeah but that means that has a that has
 

2739
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,589
yeah but that means that has a that has
a consequence one of the things i was

2740
00:44:09,589 --> 00:44:09,599
a consequence one of the things i was
 

2741
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,349
a consequence one of the things i was
trying to say is like i'm

2742
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:11,359
trying to say is like i'm
 

2743
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,589
trying to say is like i'm
i'm i'm i think

2744
00:44:13,589 --> 00:44:13,599
i'm i'm i think
 

2745
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,349
i'm i'm i think
i don't know sarah might be she can

2746
00:44:15,349 --> 00:44:15,359
i don't know sarah might be she can
 

2747
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,670
i don't know sarah might be she can
correct me information first and i'm a

2748
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:17,680
correct me information first and i'm a
 

2749
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,910
correct me information first and i'm a
object first kind of guy so i mean

2750
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:19,920
object first kind of guy so i mean
 

2751
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,589
object first kind of guy so i mean
there's things that get constructed

2752
00:44:21,589 --> 00:44:21,599
there's things that get constructed
 

2753
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,190
there's things that get constructed
there has to be this transition in

2754
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:23,200
there has to be this transition in
 

2755
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,230
there has to be this transition in
random constructions so when the the

2756
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:26,240
random constructions so when the the
 

2757
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,230
random constructions so when the the
constructing the object is construct

2758
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:28,240
constructing the object is construct
 

2759
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,630
constructing the object is construct
being constructed by the process

2760
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:30,640
being constructed by the process
 

2761
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,630
being constructed by the process
bakes in that memory and those memories

2762
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:32,640
bakes in that memory and those memories
 

2763
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,430
bakes in that memory and those memories
then add on and add on and add on

2764
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:35,440
then add on and add on and add on
 

2765
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,150
then add on and add on and add on
so as it becomes more competent and life

2766
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:38,160
so as it becomes more competent and life
 

2767
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,990
so as it becomes more competent and life
is about taking those memories and

2768
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:40,000
is about taking those memories and
 

2769
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,589
is about taking those memories and
compressing them increasing their

2770
00:44:41,589 --> 00:44:41,599
compressing them increasing their
 

2771
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,790
compressing them increasing their
autonomy

2772
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:42,800
autonomy
 

2773
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,109
autonomy
and and so i think that you know like

2774
00:44:45,109 --> 00:44:45,119
and and so i think that you know like
 

2775
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:46,790
and and so i think that you know like
the cell that we have in biology on

2776
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:46,800
the cell that we have in biology on
 

2777
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,230
the cell that we have in biology on
earth is our way of doing that that

2778
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:48,240
earth is our way of doing that that
 

2779
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,670
earth is our way of doing that that
really the maximum

2780
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:49,680
really the maximum
 

2781
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,829
really the maximum
ability to take memories and to act on

2782
00:44:51,829 --> 00:44:51,839
ability to take memories and to act on
 

2783
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,950
ability to take memories and to act on
the future

2784
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:52,960
the future
 

2785
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,030
the future
oh i think that's mathematics

2786
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:55,040
oh i think that's mathematics
 

2787
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,790
oh i think that's mathematics
um no

2788
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:56,800
um no
 

2789
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,790
um no
mathematics doesn't exist no but that's

2790
00:44:58,790 --> 00:44:58,800
mathematics doesn't exist no but that's
 

2791
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,109
mathematics doesn't exist no but that's
the point the point is that abstractions

2792
00:45:01,109 --> 00:45:01,119
the point the point is that abstractions
 

2793
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,270
the point the point is that abstractions
do exist they're real physical things we

2794
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:03,280
do exist they're real physical things we
 

2795
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,470
do exist they're real physical things we
call them

2796
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:04,480
call them
 

2797
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,109
call them
okay abstractions but the point

2798
00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:07,119
okay abstractions but the point
 

2799
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,349
okay abstractions but the point
about mathematics that i think is so i i

2800
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:09,359
about mathematics that i think is so i i
 

2801
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,109
about mathematics that i think is so i i
don't i don't disagree i think you're

2802
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:11,119
don't i don't disagree i think you're
 

2803
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:12,630
don't i don't disagree i think you're
object first and i'm information first

2804
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:12,640
object first and i'm information first
 

2805
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,470
object first and i'm information first
but i think i'm i'm only information

2806
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:14,480
but i think i'm i'm only information
 

2807
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,150
but i think i'm i'm only information
first in the sense that i think the

2808
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:16,160
first in the sense that i think the
 

2809
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,870
first in the sense that i think the
thing that we need to explain is why

2810
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:18,880
thing that we need to explain is why
 

2811
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,030
thing that we need to explain is why
what abstractions are and what they are

2812
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:21,040
what abstractions are and what they are
 

2813
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,950
what abstractions are and what they are
as physical things because of all all of

2814
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:22,960
as physical things because of all all of
 

2815
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,710
as physical things because of all all of
human history we've thought that there

2816
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:24,720
human history we've thought that there
 

2817
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,030
human history we've thought that there
were these properties that are

2818
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:27,040
were these properties that are
 

2819
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,870
were these properties that are
disembodied exist outside of the

2820
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:28,880
disembodied exist outside of the
 

2821
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,630
disembodied exist outside of the
universe and

2822
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:30,640
universe and
 

2823
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,390
universe and
really they do exist in the universe and

2824
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:32,400
really they do exist in the universe and
 

2825
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,829
really they do exist in the universe and
we just don't understand what their

2826
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:33,839
we just don't understand what their
 

2827
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,910
we just don't understand what their
physics is so i think mathematics is a

2828
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:35,920
physics is so i think mathematics is a
 

2829
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,910
physics is so i think mathematics is a
really good example we do theoretical

2830
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:37,920
really good example we do theoretical
 

2831
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,790
really good example we do theoretical
physics with math but imagine doing

2832
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:40,800
physics with math but imagine doing
 

2833
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,109
physics with math but imagine doing
physics of math and then thinking about

2834
00:45:43,109 --> 00:45:43,119
physics of math and then thinking about
 

2835
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,190
physics of math and then thinking about
math as a physical object and math is

2836
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:45,200
math as a physical object and math is
 

2837
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,030
math as a physical object and math is
super interesting i think this is why we

2838
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:47,040
super interesting i think this is why we
 

2839
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,630
super interesting i think this is why we
think it describes reality so well

2840
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:48,640
think it describes reality so well
 

2841
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,150
think it describes reality so well
because it's the most copyable kind of

2842
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:50,160
because it's the most copyable kind of
 

2843
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,230
because it's the most copyable kind of
information it retains its properties

2844
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:52,240
information it retains its properties
 

2845
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,069
information it retains its properties
when you move it between physical media

2846
00:45:54,069 --> 00:45:54,079
when you move it between physical media
 

2847
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:55,829
when you move it between physical media
which means that it's very

2848
00:45:55,829 --> 00:45:55,839
which means that it's very
 

2849
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,870
which means that it's very
d and

2850
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:56,880
d and
 

2851
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,630
d and
so it seems to describe the universe

2852
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:58,640
so it seems to describe the universe
 

2853
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,750
so it seems to describe the universe
really well but it probably is because

2854
00:45:59,750 --> 00:45:59,760
really well but it probably is because
 

2855
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,190
really well but it probably is because
it's information that's very deep in our

2856
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:01,200
it's information that's very deep in our
 

2857
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,109
it's information that's very deep in our
past and it's just

2858
00:46:03,109 --> 00:46:03,119
past and it's just
 

2859
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:05,430
past and it's just
we invented a way of

2860
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:05,440
we invented a way of
 

2861
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,190
we invented a way of
communicating it very effectively

2862
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:07,200
communicating it very effectively
 

2863
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,030
communicating it very effectively
between us

2864
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:09,040
between us
 

2865
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,550
between us
isn't math more

2866
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:10,560
isn't math more
 

2867
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,790
isn't math more
fundamental isn't as the assembly of the

2868
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:12,800
fundamental isn't as the assembly of the
 

2869
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,349
fundamental isn't as the assembly of the
graph isn't basically a i'm gonna sell i

2870
00:46:15,349 --> 00:46:15,359
graph isn't basically a i'm gonna sell i
 

2871
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:17,270
graph isn't basically a i'm gonna sell i
sound completely boring it's like math

2872
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:17,280
sound completely boring it's like math
 

2873
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,829
sound completely boring it's like math
assembly theory invented math but it did

2874
00:46:19,829 --> 00:46:19,839
assembly theory invented math but it did
 

2875
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:21,250
assembly theory invented math but it did
it has to be okay

2876
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:21,260
it has to be okay
 

2877
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:22,550
it has to be okay

so what what is uh what is math

2882
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:27,839
so what what is uh what is math
 

2883
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:31,349
so what what is uh what is math
exactly it's a uh

2884
00:46:31,349 --> 00:46:31,359
exactly it's a uh
 

2885
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:34,630
exactly it's a uh
a nice simplification

2886
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:34,640
a nice simplification
 

2887
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,270
a nice simplification
at this simple description

at this simple description
 

2889
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,190
at this simple description
of what so we have a computer scientist

2890
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:39,200
of what so we have a computer scientist
 

2891
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,829
of what so we have a computer scientist
a physicist in the chemist

2892
00:46:40,829 --> 00:46:40,839
a physicist in the chemist
 

2893
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,390
a physicist in the chemist
here why i can do a bar i think the

2894
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:42,400
here why i can do a bar i think the
 

2895
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,990
here why i can do a bar i think the
chemist is going to define math and you

2896
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:44,000
chemist is going to define math and you
 

2897
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,510
chemist is going to define math and you
guys can correct me

2898
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:45,520
guys can correct me
 

2899
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,349
guys can correct me
go for it i would say

2900
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:47,359
go for it i would say
 

2901
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,430
go for it i would say
lay it honestly

2902
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:49,440
lay it honestly
 

2903
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,790
lay it honestly
we're ready

2904
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:50,800
we're ready
 

2905
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,990
we're ready
i think the ability to um to label

2906
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:54,000
i think the ability to um to label
 

2907
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,190
i think the ability to um to label
objects and and place them into classes

2908
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:57,200
objects and and place them into classes
 

2909
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,030
objects and and place them into classes
and then do operations on the objects is

2910
00:46:59,030 --> 00:46:59,040
and then do operations on the objects is
 

2911
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,870
and then do operations on the objects is
what math is

2912
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:00,880
what math is
 

2913
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,109
what math is
so on that point what does it mean to be

2914
00:47:03,109 --> 00:47:03,119
so on that point what does it mean to be
 

2915
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,550
so on that point what does it mean to be
object first

2916
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:04,560
object first
 

2917
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,870
object first
versus information first

2918
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:06,880
versus information first
 

2919
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,309
versus information first
so what what's the difference between

2920
00:47:08,309 --> 00:47:08,319
so what what's the difference between
 

2921
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,069
so what what's the difference between
object and information when you get to

2922
00:47:10,069 --> 00:47:10,079
object and information when you get to
 

2923
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,790
object and information when you get to
that low fundamental level well i might

2924
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:12,800
that low fundamental level well i might
 

2925
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,190
that low fundamental level well i might
change my view so i'm stuff first the

2926
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:15,200
change my view so i'm stuff first the
 

2927
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,309
change my view so i'm stuff first the
stuff

2928
00:47:16,309 --> 00:47:16,319
stuff
 

2929
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,790
stuff
and then when stuff becomes objects it

2930
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:18,800
and then when stuff becomes objects it
 

2931
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,349
and then when stuff becomes objects it
has to invent information

2932
00:47:21,349 --> 00:47:21,359
has to invent information
 

2933
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,349
has to invent information
and then the information acts on more

2934
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:23,359
and then the information acts on more
 

2935
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:24,950
and then the information acts on more
stuff and becomes more objects so i

2936
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:24,960
stuff and becomes more objects so i
 

2937
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,309
stuff and becomes more objects so i
think there is a transition to

2938
00:47:26,309 --> 00:47:26,319
think there is a transition to
 

2939
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:27,589
think there is a transition to
information

2940
00:47:27,589 --> 00:47:27,599
information
 

2941
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,109
information
that occurs when you go from stuff to

2942
00:47:29,109 --> 00:47:29,119
that occurs when you go from stuff to
 

2943
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:30,549
that occurs when you go from stuff to
objects

2944
00:47:30,549 --> 00:47:30,559
objects
 

2945
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,390
objects
yeah information is

2946
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:32,400
yeah information is
 

2947
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,150
yeah information is
emergent not emergent information is

2948
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:36,160
emergent not emergent information is
 

2949
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,230
emergent not emergent information is
actionable memories from the universe

2950
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:40,240
actionable memories from the universe
 

2951
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,710
actionable memories from the universe
so when when memories become actionable

2952
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:42,720
so when when memories become actionable
 

2953
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,630
so when when memories become actionable
that's information

2954
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:44,640
that's information
 

2955
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,870
that's information
but there's always memory but it's not

2956
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:46,880
but there's always memory but it's not
 

2957
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,150
but there's always memory but it's not
actionable

2958
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:48,160
actionable
 

2959
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,829
actionable
yeah and then it's not information great

2960
00:47:49,829 --> 00:47:49,839
yeah and then it's not information great
 

2961
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:52,230
yeah and then it's not information great
and actionable is what you can create

2962
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:52,240
and actionable is what you can create
 

2963
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,510
and actionable is what you can create
you can use it

2964
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:53,520
you can use it
 

2965
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,030
you can use it
if you can't use it then it's not

2966
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:55,040
if you can't use it then it's not
 

2967
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,950
if you can't use it then it's not
information if you can't transmit it if

2968
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:56,960
information if you can't transmit it if
 

2969
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,630
information if you can't transmit it if
you if it doesn't have any causal

2970
00:47:58,630 --> 00:47:58,640
you if it doesn't have any causal
 

2971
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,790
you if it doesn't have any causal
consequences in the force i don't

2972
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:00,800
consequences in the force i don't
 

2973
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,430
consequences in the force i don't
understand why is that not information

2974
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:03,440
understand why is that not information
 

2975
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,309
understand why is that not information
it's not information it's it's um it's

2976
00:48:06,309 --> 00:48:06,319
it's not information it's it's um it's
 

2977
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,630
it's not information it's it's um it's
uh stuff it's stuff happening but it's

2978
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:08,640
uh stuff it's stuff happening but it's
 

2979
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,750
uh stuff it's stuff happening but it's
not it's not cause yeah yeah we can this

2980
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:11,760
not it's not cause yeah yeah we can this
 

2981
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,390
not it's not cause yeah yeah we can this
is happening no not happening requires

2982
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:14,400
is happening no not happening requires
 

2983
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,790
is happening no not happening requires
information no no no no

2984
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:16,800
information no no no no
 

2985
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,950
information no no no no
stuff is always happening no this is

2986
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:18,960
stuff is always happening no this is
 

2987
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:19,990
stuff is always happening no this is
where the physicists get and the

2988
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:20,000
where the physicists get and the
 

2989
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,670
where the physicists get and the
mathematicians get themselves in a loop

2990
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:21,680
mathematicians get themselves in a loop
 

2991
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,470
mathematicians get themselves in a loop
because they think the universe i mean

2992
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:24,480
because they think the universe i mean
 

2993
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,190
because they think the universe i mean
i think uh say max tegmark and and is

2994
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:27,200
i think uh say max tegmark and and is
 

2995
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,190
i think uh say max tegmark and and is
very playful and say like the universe

2996
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:29,200
very playful and say like the universe
 

2997
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,710
very playful and say like the universe
universe just meth well the universe is

2998
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:30,720
universe just meth well the universe is
 

2999
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,470
universe just meth well the universe is
just math then we might as well not

3000
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:32,480
just math then we might as well not
 

3001
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,150
just math then we might as well not
bother having any conversation because

3002
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:34,160
bother having any conversation because
 

3003
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,190
bother having any conversation because
the conversation already written we just

3004
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:35,200
the conversation already written we just
 

3005
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,309
the conversation already written we just
never go to the future and say can you

3006
00:48:36,309 --> 00:48:36,319
never go to the future and say can you
 

3007
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:37,510
never go to the future and say can you
just give us the conversation it's

3008
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:37,520
just give us the conversation it's
 

3009
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,510
just give us the conversation it's
happened already so i think the problem

3010
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:39,520
happened already so i think the problem
 

3011
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,270
happened already so i think the problem
is that mathematicians

3012
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:41,280
is that mathematicians
 

3013
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,829
is that mathematicians
are so successful labeling stuff and so

3014
00:48:43,829 --> 00:48:43,839
are so successful labeling stuff and so
 

3015
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:45,109
are so successful labeling stuff and so
successful understanding of stuff

3016
00:48:45,109 --> 00:48:45,119
successful understanding of stuff
 

3017
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,950
successful understanding of stuff
through those labels they forget that

3018
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:46,960
through those labels they forget that
 

3019
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,349
through those labels they forget that
actually the those labels had to emerge

3020
00:48:49,349 --> 00:48:49,359
actually the those labels had to emerge
 

3021
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:50,870
actually the those labels had to emerge
and that information

3022
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:50,880
and that information
 

3023
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,349
and that information
had to be built on those memories so

3024
00:48:53,349 --> 00:48:53,359
had to be built on those memories so
 

3025
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:55,670
had to be built on those memories so
memory in the universe so constraints

3026
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:55,680
memory in the universe so constraints
 

3027
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,750
memory in the universe so constraints
graph when they become actionable and

3028
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:57,760
graph when they become actionable and
 

3029
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,750
graph when they become actionable and
the graph can loop back on itself or

3030
00:48:59,750 --> 00:48:59,760
the graph can loop back on itself or
 

3031
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,510
the graph can loop back on itself or
interact with other graphs and they can

3032
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:01,520
interact with other graphs and they can
 

3033
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,790
interact with other graphs and they can
intersect

3034
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:02,800
intersect
 

3035
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,390
intersect
those memories become actionable and

3036
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:04,400
those memories become actionable and
 

3037
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,870
those memories become actionable and
therefore their information and i think

3038
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:06,880
therefore their information and i think
 

3039
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,109
therefore their information and i think
you just changed my son my my mind on

3040
00:49:09,109 --> 00:49:09,119
you just changed my son my my mind on
 

3041
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,630
you just changed my son my my mind on
something pretty big but i don't have a

3042
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:10,640
something pretty big but i don't have a
 

3043
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,069
something pretty big but i don't have a
pen so i can't i'm gonna write it down

3044
00:49:12,069 --> 00:49:12,079
pen so i can't i'm gonna write it down
 

3045
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,630
pen so i can't i'm gonna write it down
later but roughly the idea is it's like

3046
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:14,640
later but roughly the idea is it's like
 

3047
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,109
later but roughly the idea is it's like
you've got these these two graphs of

3048
00:49:17,109 --> 00:49:17,119
you've got these these two graphs of
 

3049
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:18,630
you've got these these two graphs of
objects of stuff

3050
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:18,640
objects of stuff
 

3051
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,309
objects of stuff
they have memories

3052
00:49:20,309 --> 00:49:20,319
they have memories
 

3053
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:22,309
they have memories
and then when they intersect

3054
00:49:22,309 --> 00:49:22,319
and then when they intersect
 

3055
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:24,309
and then when they intersect
and then they can act on each other

3056
00:49:24,309 --> 00:49:24,319
and then they can act on each other
 

3057
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:25,990
and then they can act on each other
that's maybe the mechanism by which

3058
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:26,000
that's maybe the mechanism by which
 

3059
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,309
that's maybe the mechanism by which
information is then so then you can then

3060
00:49:28,309 --> 00:49:28,319
information is then so then you can then
 

3061
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,030
information is then so then you can then
abstract so one when one graph can then

3062
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:31,040
abstract so one when one graph can then
 

3063
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,790
abstract so one when one graph can then
build another graph and say hey you'll

3064
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:32,800
build another graph and say hey you'll
 

3065
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:33,829
build another graph and say hey you'll
have to go through all the nonsense we

3066
00:49:33,829 --> 00:49:33,839
have to go through all the nonsense we
 

3067
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,270
have to go through all the nonsense we
had to go through here's literally the

3068
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:35,280
had to go through here's literally the
 

3069
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,670
had to go through here's literally the
way to do it staff always comes first

3070
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:37,680
way to do it staff always comes first
 

3071
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,870
way to do it staff always comes first
but then when staff builds the

3072
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:38,880
but then when staff builds the
 

3073
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,470
but then when staff builds the
abstraction the abstraction can be then

3074
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:40,480
abstraction the abstraction can be then
 

3075
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,230
abstraction the abstraction can be then
teleported onto other stuff directions

3076
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:42,240
teleported onto other stuff directions
 

3077
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,870
teleported onto other stuff directions
is the looping back yeah power

3078
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:44,880
is the looping back yeah power

a god made stuff
 

3085
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,670
a god made stuff

and after that
 

3087
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,670
and after that
when you start to be able to uh form

00:50:04,309 --> 00:50:04,319
otherwise there's no way did you just
 

3097
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:05,750
otherwise there's no way did you just
differ in that statement hundreds of

differ in that statement hundreds of
 

3099
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,910
differ in that statement hundreds of
years from now what does that mean what

3100
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:07,920
years from now what does that mean what
 

3101
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,910
years from now what does that mean what
did the humans mean by this hey look

3102
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:09,920
did the humans mean by this hey look
 

3103
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,950

it means what does it mean
okay wait we need to

what is accurate mathematics it's the
 

3135
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,109
what is accurate mathematics it's the
most efficient labeling scheme that you

most efficient labeling scheme that you
 

3137
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:49,030
most efficient labeling scheme that you
can apply to lots of different graphs

3138

can apply to lots of different graphs
 

3139
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,790
can apply to lots of different graphs
well the labeling scheme

3140
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:50,800
well the labeling scheme
 

3141
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,270
well the labeling scheme
doesn't make it sound useful can i try

3142
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:53,280
doesn't make it sound useful can i try
 

3143
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,510
doesn't make it sound useful can i try
yeah sure please have you rejected my

3144
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:55,520
yeah sure please have you rejected my
 

3145
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,670
yeah sure please have you rejected my
definition of mathematics i'm shocked

3146
00:50:57,670 --> 00:50:57,680
definition of mathematics i'm shocked
 

3147
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:01,109
definition of mathematics i'm shocked
yeah no i'm sorry um but it's correct

3148
00:51:01,109 --> 00:51:01,119
yeah no i'm sorry um but it's correct
 

3149
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:03,990
yeah no i'm sorry um but it's correct
oh i'm sorry excellent um no i mean i

3150
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:04,000
oh i'm sorry excellent um no i mean i
 

3151
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,230
oh i'm sorry excellent um no i mean i
think um i think we have a problem right

3152
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:06,240
think um i think we have a problem right
 

3153
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,790
think um i think we have a problem right
because we we can't not be us like we're

3154
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:08,800
because we we can't not be us like we're
 

3155
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,390
because we we can't not be us like we're
stuck in the shells we are and we're

3156
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:10,400
stuck in the shells we are and we're
 

3157
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,750
stuck in the shells we are and we're
trying to observe the world and so

3158
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:11,760
trying to observe the world and so
 

3159
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,109
trying to observe the world and so
mathematics looks like it has certain

3160
00:51:13,109 --> 00:51:13,119
mathematics looks like it has certain
 

3161
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:14,790
mathematics looks like it has certain
properties and i guess the thought

3162
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:14,800
properties and i guess the thought
 

3163
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,710
properties and i guess the thought
experiment i find is useful is to try to

3164
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:16,720
experiment i find is useful is to try to
 

3165
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,950
experiment i find is useful is to try to
imagine if you were outside of us

3166
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:18,960
imagine if you were outside of us
 

3167
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,030
imagine if you were outside of us
looking at us as physical systems using

3168
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:21,040
looking at us as physical systems using
 

3169
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,190
looking at us as physical systems using
mathematics what would be the specific

3170
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:23,200
mathematics what would be the specific
 

3171
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,790
mathematics what would be the specific
features you associate

3172
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:24,800
features you associate
 

3173
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,670
features you associate
to the property of

3174
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:27,680
to the property of
 

3175
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,109
to the property of
understanding mathematics and being able

3176
00:51:29,109 --> 00:51:29,119
understanding mathematics and being able
 

3177
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,109
understanding mathematics and being able
to implement it in the universe

3178
00:51:31,109 --> 00:51:31,119
to implement it in the universe
 

3179
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:31,910
to implement it in the universe
right

3180
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:31,920
right
 

3181
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,630
right
and um and when you do that mathematics

3182
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:34,640
and um and when you do that mathematics
 

3183
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,069
and um and when you do that mathematics
seems to have some really interesting

3184
00:51:36,069 --> 00:51:36,079
seems to have some really interesting
 

3185
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:38,549
seems to have some really interesting
properties relative to other kinds of

3186
00:51:38,549 --> 00:51:38,559
properties relative to other kinds of
 

3187
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:39,829
properties relative to other kinds of
abstraction we might talk about like

3188
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:39,839
abstraction we might talk about like
 

3189
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,950
abstraction we might talk about like
language or artistic expression

3190
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:42,960
language or artistic expression
 

3191
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,390
language or artistic expression
one of those properties is the one i

3192
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:44,400
one of those properties is the one i
 

3193
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,069
one of those properties is the one i
mentioned already that is really easy to

3194
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:46,079
mentioned already that is really easy to
 

3195
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:48,870
mentioned already that is really easy to
copy between physical media so if i give

3196
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:48,880
copy between physical media so if i give
 

3197
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,710
copy between physical media so if i give
you a mathematical statement you almost

3198
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:50,720
you a mathematical statement you almost
 

3199
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,150
you a mathematical statement you almost
immediately know what i mean if i tell

3200
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:52,160
immediately know what i mean if i tell
 

3201
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,150
immediately know what i mean if i tell
you the sky is blue you might say is it

3202
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:54,160
you the sky is blue you might say is it
 

3203
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,589
you the sky is blue you might say is it
cobalt blue is it is your blue what

3204
00:51:55,589 --> 00:51:55,599
cobalt blue is it is your blue what
 

3205
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:57,030
cobalt blue is it is your blue what
color blue do you mean and you have a

3206
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:57,040
color blue do you mean and you have a
 

3207
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,829
color blue do you mean and you have a
harder time visualizing what i actually

3208
00:51:59,829 --> 00:51:59,839
harder time visualizing what i actually
 

3209
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:01,270
harder time visualizing what i actually
mean so mathematics carries a lot of

3210
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:01,280
mean so mathematics carries a lot of
 

3211
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,630
mean so mathematics carries a lot of
meaning with it when it's copied between

3212
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:02,640
meaning with it when it's copied between
 

3213
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,069
meaning with it when it's copied between
physical systems it's also the reason we

3214
00:52:04,069 --> 00:52:04,079
physical systems it's also the reason we
 

3215
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,150
physical systems it's also the reason we
use it to communicate with computers

3216
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:06,160
use it to communicate with computers
 

3217
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,950
use it to communicate with computers
um and then the second one is it retains

3218
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:08,960
um and then the second one is it retains
 

3219
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,829
um and then the second one is it retains
its property of actually what it can do

3220
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:11,839
its property of actually what it can do
 

3221
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:14,390
its property of actually what it can do
in the universe when it's copied so the

3222
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:14,400
in the universe when it's copied so the
 

3223
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,470
in the universe when it's copied so the
example i like to give there is is think

3224
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:16,480
example i like to give there is is think
 

3225
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,630
example i like to give there is is think
about like newton's law of gravitation

3226
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:18,640
about like newton's law of gravitation
 

3227
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,950
about like newton's law of gravitation
um it's actually it's a it's a

3228
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:20,960
um it's actually it's a it's a
 

3229
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,270
um it's actually it's a it's a
compressed regularity of a bunch of uh

3230
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:23,280
compressed regularity of a bunch of uh
 

3231
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,630
compressed regularity of a bunch of uh
phenomena that we observe in the

3232
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:24,640
phenomena that we observe in the
 

3233
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,030
phenomena that we observe in the
universe but then it'll that information

3234
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:27,040
universe but then it'll that information
 

3235
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,790
universe but then it'll that information
actually is a causal in a sense that it

3236
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:28,800
actually is a causal in a sense that it
 

3237
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,069
actually is a causal in a sense that it
allows us to do things we wouldn't be

3238
00:52:30,069 --> 00:52:30,079
allows us to do things we wouldn't be
 

3239
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,430
allows us to do things we wouldn't be
able to do without that particular

3240
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:31,440
able to do without that particular
 

3241
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,309
able to do without that particular
knowledge and that particular

3242
00:52:32,309 --> 00:52:32,319
knowledge and that particular
 

3243
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,230
knowledge and that particular
abstraction and in this case like launch

3244
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:34,240
abstraction and in this case like launch
 

3245
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,670
abstraction and in this case like launch
satellites to space or send people to

3246
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:35,680
satellites to space or send people to
 

3247
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,069
satellites to space or send people to
mars or whatever it is um

3248
00:52:38,069 --> 00:52:38,079
mars or whatever it is um
 

3249
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:39,030
mars or whatever it is um
so

3250
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:39,040
so
 

3251
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,790
so
so if you look at us from the outside

3252
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:40,800
so if you look at us from the outside
 

3253
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,230
so if you look at us from the outside
and you say what is it for physical

3254
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:42,240
and you say what is it for physical
 

3255
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,589
and you say what is it for physical
systems to invent a thing called

3256
00:52:43,589 --> 00:52:43,599
systems to invent a thing called
 

3257
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:47,109
systems to invent a thing called
mathematics and then to use uh

3258
00:52:47,109 --> 00:52:47,119
mathematics and then to use uh
 

3259
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:48,309
mathematics and then to use uh
and and then

3260
00:52:48,309 --> 00:52:48,319
and and then
 

3261
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:50,150
and and then
and then it to become a physical

3262
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:50,160
and then it to become a physical
 

3263
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,710
and then it to become a physical
observable mathematics is kind of like

3264
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:52,720
observable mathematics is kind of like
 

3265
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,430
observable mathematics is kind of like
the universally copyable information

3266
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:55,440
the universally copyable information
 

3267
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,390
the universally copyable information
that allows uh new possibility spaces to

3268
00:52:58,390 --> 00:52:58,400
that allows uh new possibility spaces to
 

3269
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,069
that allows uh new possibility spaces to
be open in the future because it allows

3270
00:53:00,069 --> 00:53:00,079
be open in the future because it allows
 

3271
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,069
be open in the future because it allows
this kind of ability to map one physical

3272
00:53:02,069 --> 00:53:02,079
this kind of ability to map one physical
 

3273
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,510
this kind of ability to map one physical
system to another and actually

3274
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:03,520
system to another and actually
 

3275
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,349
system to another and actually
understand that the general principles

3276
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:05,359
understand that the general principles
 

3277
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:09,109
understand that the general principles
yeah so is it helping the uh overlap of

3278
00:53:09,109 --> 00:53:09,119
yeah so is it helping the uh overlap of
 

3279
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,150
yeah so is it helping the uh overlap of
causal graphs then by mapping oh well i

3280
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:12,160
causal graphs then by mapping oh well i
 

3281
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,829
causal graphs then by mapping oh well i
think that's the explanation for what it

3282
00:53:13,829 --> 00:53:13,839
think that's the explanation for what it
 

3283
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:15,190
think that's the explanation for what it
is in terms of the physical theory of

3284
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:15,200
is in terms of the physical theory of
 

3285
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,349
is in terms of the physical theory of
assembly would be some feature of the

3286
00:53:17,349 --> 00:53:17,359
assembly would be some feature of the
 

3287
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:18,870
assembly would be some feature of the
structure of

3288
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:18,880
structure of
 

3289
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,549
structure of
the assembly spaces the causal graphs

3290
00:53:20,549 --> 00:53:20,559
the assembly spaces the causal graphs
 

3291
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:22,710
the assembly spaces the causal graphs
and their relationship to each other so

3292
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:22,720
and their relationship to each other so
 

3293
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,190
and their relationship to each other so
for example and i mean this is things

3294
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:25,200
for example and i mean this is things
 

3295
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,069
for example and i mean this is things
that we're going to have to work out

3296
00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:26,079
that we're going to have to work out
 

3297
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:27,510
that we're going to have to work out
over the next few years i mean we're in

3298
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:27,520
over the next few years i mean we're in
 

3299
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,430
over the next few years i mean we're in
totally uncharted conceptual territory

3300
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:29,440
totally uncharted conceptual territory
 

3301
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,069
totally uncharted conceptual territory
here um but

3302
00:53:32,069 --> 00:53:32,079
here um but
 

3303
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:35,190
here um but
as is usual diving off the deep end um

3304
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:35,200
as is usual diving off the deep end um
 

3305
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,349
as is usual diving off the deep end um
but i would expect that we would be able

3306
00:53:37,349 --> 00:53:37,359
but i would expect that we would be able
 

3307
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:39,430
but i would expect that we would be able
to come up with a theory of like why is

3308
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:39,440
to come up with a theory of like why is
 

3309
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,790
to come up with a theory of like why is
it that some physical systems can

3310
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:40,800
it that some physical systems can
 

3311
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,950
it that some physical systems can
communicate with each other

3312
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:42,960
communicate with each other
 

3313
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,270
communicate with each other
like language language is basically

3314
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:45,280
like language language is basically
 

3315
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,109
like language language is basically
because we're objects extended over time

3316
00:53:47,109 --> 00:53:47,119
because we're objects extended over time
 

3317
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:49,349
because we're objects extended over time
and some of the history of that assembly

3318
00:53:49,349 --> 00:53:49,359
and some of the history of that assembly
 

3319
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,430
and some of the history of that assembly
space actually overlaps and when we

3320
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:51,440
space actually overlaps and when we
 

3321
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,790
space actually overlaps and when we
communicate it's because we actually

3322
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:52,800
communicate it's because we actually
 

3323
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,150
communicate it's because we actually
have shared structure in our causal

3324
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:54,160
have shared structure in our causal
 

3325
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,910
have shared structure in our causal
history so let me have another quick go

3326
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:55,920
history so let me have another quick go
 

3327
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,510
history so let me have another quick go
at this right so i think we all agree so

3328
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:57,520
at this right so i think we all agree so
 

3329
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,670
at this right so i think we all agree so
i think um

3330
00:53:59,670 --> 00:53:59,680
i think um
 

3331
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,589
i think um
we take mathematics for granted because

3332
00:54:01,589 --> 00:54:01,599
we take mathematics for granted because
 

3333
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:03,109
we take mathematics for granted because
we've gone through this chain right of

3334
00:54:03,109 --> 00:54:03,119
we've gone through this chain right of
 

3335
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,270
we've gone through this chain right of
you know um we all we all share a

3336
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:05,280
you know um we all we all share a
 

3337
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,030
you know um we all we all share a
language now okay and we can well we

3338
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:07,040
language now okay and we can well we
 

3339
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,710
language now okay and we can well we
share length so we have languages that

3340
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:08,720
share length so we have languages that
 

3341
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,349
share length so we have languages that
we can we can make interoperable

3342
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:11,359
we can we can make interoperable
 

3343
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:14,230
we can we can make interoperable
and and so whether you're speaking

3344
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:14,240
and and so whether you're speaking
 

3345
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,230
and and so whether you're speaking
i don't know all the different dialects

3346
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:16,240
i don't know all the different dialects
 

3347
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,710
i don't know all the different dialects
of chinese all the different dialects of

00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:18,720
of chinese all the different dialects of
 

3349
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,670

french german whatever you can
 

3353
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,190
french german whatever you can
interconvert them the interesting thing

3354
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:23,200
interconvert them the interesting thing
 

3355
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,950
interconvert them the interesting thing
about mathematics now is that everybody

3356
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:24,960
about mathematics now is that everybody
 

3357
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,630
about mathematics now is that everybody
on planet earth every human being and

3358
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:26,640
on planet earth every human being and
 

3359
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,670
on planet earth every human being and
computers um share that common language

3360
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:29,680
computers um share that common language
 

3361
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,829
computers um share that common language
that language was constructed by a

3362
00:54:31,829 --> 00:54:31,839
that language was constructed by a
 

3363
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:33,829
that language was constructed by a
process in time so what i'm trying to

3364
00:54:33,829 --> 00:54:33,839
process in time so what i'm trying to
 

3365
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:36,069
process in time so what i'm trying to
say is assembly invented math is those

3366
00:54:36,069 --> 00:54:36,079
say is assembly invented math is those
 

3367
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:37,829
say is assembly invented math is those
those pro right from the you know

3368
00:54:37,829 --> 00:54:37,839
those pro right from the you know
 

3369
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:39,750
those pro right from the you know
mathematics didn't occur it didn't exist

3370
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:39,760
mathematics didn't occur it didn't exist
 

3371
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,030
mathematics didn't occur it didn't exist
before life abstraction was invented by

3372
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:43,040
before life abstraction was invented by
 

3373
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,870
before life abstraction was invented by
life right that doesn't mean that the

3374
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:44,880
life right that doesn't mean that the
 

3375
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,710
life right that doesn't mean that the
universe wasn't capable of mathematical

3376
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:46,720
universe wasn't capable of mathematical
 

3377
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,230
universe wasn't capable of mathematical
things wait wait a minute can we just

3378
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:48,240
things wait wait a minute can we just
 

3379
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,789
things wait wait a minute can we just
ask that that old famous question is

3380
00:54:50,789 --> 00:54:50,799
ask that that old famous question is
 

3381
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:53,109
ask that that old famous question is
math invented or discovered so when you

3382
00:54:53,109 --> 00:54:53,119
math invented or discovered so when you
 

3383
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:55,670
math invented or discovered so when you
say assembly invented

3384
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:55,680
say assembly invented
 

3385
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,109
say assembly invented
or whatever

3386
00:54:57,109 --> 00:54:57,119
or whatever
 

3387
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,430
or whatever
uh you you it means this is simply a

3388
00:54:59,430 --> 00:54:59,440
uh you you it means this is simply a
 

3389
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,430
uh you you it means this is simply a
mathematical theory but sorry

3390
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:01,440
mathematical theory but sorry
 

3391
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,109
mathematical theory but sorry
right are we arguing exactly are we

3392
00:55:03,109 --> 00:55:03,119
right are we arguing exactly are we
 

3393
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:04,870
right are we arguing exactly are we
arguing that that's what it sounds like

3394
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:04,880
arguing that that's what it sounds like
 

3395
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,789
arguing that that's what it sounds like
i we discovering

3396
00:55:06,789 --> 00:55:06,799
i we discovering
 

3397
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:09,589
i we discovering
no well yes and no i would say

3398
00:55:09,589 --> 00:55:09,599
no well yes and no i would say
 

3399
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,829
no well yes and no i would say
you called mathematics a language

3400
00:55:11,829 --> 00:55:11,839
you called mathematics a language
 

3401
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:13,750
you called mathematics a language
i would say developing like i'm pretty

3402
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:13,760
i would say developing like i'm pretty
 

3403
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,349
i would say developing like i'm pretty
sure that um

3404
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:15,359
sure that um
 

3405
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:17,349
sure that um
there are some very common seeds of

3406
00:55:17,349 --> 00:55:17,359
there are some very common seeds of
 

3407
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:19,829
there are some very common seeds of
mathematics in the universe right but

3408
00:55:19,829 --> 00:55:19,839
mathematics in the universe right but
 

3409
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:22,150
mathematics in the universe right but
actually not the mathematics that we are

3410
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:22,160
actually not the mathematics that we are
 

3411
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,829
actually not the mathematics that we are
finding now

3412
00:55:23,829 --> 00:55:23,839
finding now
 

3413
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:27,109
finding now
is not discovered it's invented

3414
00:55:27,109 --> 00:55:27,119
is not discovered it's invented
 

3415
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:28,630
is not discovered it's invented
and but even though i think those two

3416
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:28,640
and but even though i think those two
 

3417
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,150
and but even though i think those two
terms are very triggering and i don't

3418
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:30,160
terms are very triggering and i don't
 

3419
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,069
terms are very triggering and i don't
think they're necessarily useful because

3420
00:55:32,069 --> 00:55:32,079
think they're necessarily useful because
 

3421
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,829
think they're necessarily useful because
i think that what people do the

3422
00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:33,839
i think that what people do the
 

3423
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:36,069
i think that what people do the
mathematicians that say oh mathematics

3424
00:55:36,069 --> 00:55:36,079
mathematicians that say oh mathematics
 

3425
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:37,990
mathematicians that say oh mathematics
was discovered

3426
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:38,000
was discovered
 

3427
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,589
was discovered
because they live in a universe where

3428
00:55:39,589 --> 00:55:39,599
because they live in a universe where
 

3429
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,309
because they live in a universe where
there is no time and it just all exists

3430
00:55:42,309 --> 00:55:42,319
there is no time and it just all exists
 

3431
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:44,630
there is no time and it just all exists
but what i'm saying is and i think in

3432
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:44,640
but what i'm saying is and i think in
 

3433
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,390
but what i'm saying is and i think in
the same way you can create let's say

3434
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:46,400
the same way you can create let's say
 

3435
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,549
the same way you can create let's say
i'm going to go and create and make a

3436
00:55:48,549 --> 00:55:48,559
i'm going to go and create and make a
 

3437
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:51,270
i'm going to go and create and make a
piece of art

3438
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:51,280
piece of art
 

3439
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,990
piece of art
did i make that piece of art or did i

3440
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:54,000
did i make that piece of art or did i
 

3441
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,829
did i make that piece of art or did i
escape discover it

3442
00:55:55,829 --> 00:55:55,839
escape discover it
 

3443
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:57,829
escape discover it
like inventing the airplane did i invent

3444
00:55:57,829 --> 00:55:57,839
like inventing the airplane did i invent
 

3445
00:55:57,839 --> 00:55:59,030
like inventing the airplane did i invent
the airplane let's stick with the

3446
00:55:59,030 --> 00:55:59,040
the airplane let's stick with the
 

3447
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,630
the airplane let's stick with the
airplane the airplane's a good one i

3448
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:00,640
airplane the airplane's a good one i
 

3449
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,309
airplane the airplane's a good one i
let's say i'm i did i discovered the

3450
00:56:02,309 --> 00:56:02,319
let's say i'm i did i discovered the
 

3451
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:03,990
let's say i'm i did i discovered the
airplane well in a way the universe

3452
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:04,000
airplane well in a way the universe
 

3453
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,109
airplane well in a way the universe
discovered the airplane because it just

3454
00:56:05,109 --> 00:56:05,119
discovered the airplane because it just
 

3455
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,390
discovered the airplane because it just
chucked a load of atoms together a load

3456
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:06,400
chucked a load of atoms together a load
 

3457
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,150
chucked a load of atoms together a load
of random human beings won't do stuff

3458
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:08,160
of random human beings won't do stuff
 

3459
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,549
of random human beings won't do stuff
and they we we discovered the aeroplane

3460
00:56:10,549 --> 00:56:10,559
and they we we discovered the aeroplane
 

3461
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:12,549
and they we we discovered the aeroplane
in the space of possibilities but here's

3462
00:56:12,549 --> 00:56:12,559
in the space of possibilities but here's
 

3463
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:14,069
in the space of possibilities but here's
the thing when the space of

3464
00:56:14,069 --> 00:56:14,079
the thing when the space of
 

3465
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,710
the thing when the space of
possibilities is so

3466
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:16,720
possibilities is so
 

3467
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,069
possibilities is so
vast

3468
00:56:18,069 --> 00:56:18,079
vast
 

3469
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:19,990
vast
infinite almost

3470
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:20,000
infinite almost
 

3471
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,910
infinite almost
and you're able to actualize one of

3472
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:21,920
and you're able to actualize one of
 

3473
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,910
and you're able to actualize one of
those in an object and you are inventing

3474
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:23,920
those in an object and you are inventing
 

3475
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,309
those in an object and you are inventing
it so in mathematics because there are

3476
00:56:26,309 --> 00:56:26,319
it so in mathematics because there are
 

3477
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:28,069
it so in mathematics because there are
infinite number of theorems the fact

3478
00:56:28,069 --> 00:56:28,079
infinite number of theorems the fact
 

3479
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:29,589
infinite number of theorems the fact
you're actually pulling there's no

3480
00:56:29,589 --> 00:56:29,599
you're actually pulling there's no
 

3481
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:30,950
you're actually pulling there's no
difference between

3482
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:30,960
difference between
 

3483
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,030
difference between
inventing a mathematical structure and

3484
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:33,040
inventing a mathematical structure and
 

3485
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,710
inventing a mathematical structure and
inventing the airplane they're the same

3486
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:34,720
inventing the airplane they're the same
 

3487
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,630
inventing the airplane they're the same
thing but that doesn't mean that now the

3488
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:36,640
thing but that doesn't mean that now the
 

3489
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,470
thing but that doesn't mean that now the
airplane exists in the universe there's

3490
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:38,480
airplane exists in the universe there's
 

3491
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,390
airplane exists in the universe there's
something weird about the universe that

3492
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:40,400
something weird about the universe that
 

3493
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,950
something weird about the universe that
you know so i think that the more this

3494
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:42,960
you know so i think that the more this
 

3495
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,950
you know so i think that the more this
is the thing that i you probably the

3496
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:44,960
is the thing that i you probably the
 

3497
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,309
is the thing that i you probably the
more memory

3498
00:56:46,309 --> 00:56:46,319
more memory
 

3499
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,710
more memory
required for the object the more

3500
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:48,720
required for the object the more
 

3501
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,270
required for the object the more
invented it is so when a mathematical

3502
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:51,280
invented it is so when a mathematical
 

3503
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,710
invented it is so when a mathematical
theorem has a

3504
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:52,720
theorem has a
 

3505
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,589
theorem has a
hazard needs more bytes to store it the

3506
00:56:55,589 --> 00:56:55,599
hazard needs more bytes to store it the
 

3507
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:57,910
hazard needs more bytes to store it the
more invented it is and the less bites

3508
00:56:57,910 --> 00:56:57,920
more invented it is and the less bites
 

3509
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,910
more invented it is and the less bites
the more discovered is

3510
00:56:59,910 --> 00:56:59,920
the more discovered is
 

3511
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,069
the more discovered is
but everything then is invented it's

3512
00:57:02,069 --> 00:57:02,079
but everything then is invented it's
 

3513
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:04,710
but everything then is invented it's
just more or less invented absolutely

3514
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:04,720
just more or less invented absolutely
 

3515
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:05,510
just more or less invented absolutely
okay

3516
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:05,520
okay
 

3517
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,670
okay
has to generate everything as it goes

3518
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:07,680
has to generate everything as it goes
 

3519
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,510
has to generate everything as it goes
yeah

3520
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:09,520
yeah
 

3521
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,030
yeah
and it wasn't there in the beginning and

3522
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:11,040
and it wasn't there in the beginning and
 

3523
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,630
and it wasn't there in the beginning and
the way we're thinking it

3524
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:12,640
the way we're thinking it
 

3525
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,670
the way we're thinking it
when you're thinking about the

3526
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:13,680
when you're thinking about the
 

3527
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,430
when you're thinking about the
difference between invented discovered

3528
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:15,440
difference between invented discovered
 

3529
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,870
difference between invented discovered
is because we're throwing away all the

3530
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:16,880
is because we're throwing away all the
 

3531
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,670
is because we're throwing away all the
memory yeah so if you start to think in

3532
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:19,680
memory yeah so if you start to think in
 

3533
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,069
memory yeah so if you start to think in
terms of causality and time

3534
00:57:22,069 --> 00:57:22,079
terms of causality and time
 

3535
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:23,589
terms of causality and time
then those things become the same

3536
00:57:23,589 --> 00:57:23,599
then those things become the same
 

3537
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:24,829
then those things become the same
everything is

3538
00:57:24,829 --> 00:57:24,839
everything is
 

3539
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:26,630
everything is
invented and the idea is to make

3540
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:26,640
invented and the idea is to make
 

3541
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,230
invented and the idea is to make
everything intrinsic to the universe so

3542
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:28,240
everything intrinsic to the universe so
 

3543
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,230
everything intrinsic to the universe so
i think one of the features of assembly

3544
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:30,240
i think one of the features of assembly
 

3545
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,910
i think one of the features of assembly
theory is we don't want to have external

3546
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:31,920
theory is we don't want to have external
 

3547
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,030
theory is we don't want to have external
observers there's been this long

3548
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:33,040
observers there's been this long
 

3549
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,230
observers there's been this long
tradition in physics of trying to

3550
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:34,240
tradition in physics of trying to
 

3551
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,510
tradition in physics of trying to
describe the universe from the outside

3552
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:35,520
describe the universe from the outside
 

3553
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,349
describe the universe from the outside
and not the inside

3554
00:57:37,349 --> 00:57:37,359
and not the inside
 

3555
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:38,230
and not the inside
and

3556
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:38,240
and
 

3557
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,589
and
the universe has to generate everything

3558
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:39,599
the universe has to generate everything
 

3559
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:40,950
the universe has to generate everything
itself if you do it from the inside

3560
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:40,960
itself if you do it from the inside

assembly theory describes how the

3562
00:57:42,789 --> 00:57:42,799
assembly theory describes how the

00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:46,309
assembly theory describes how the

3565
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:48,309

did it take you 15 seconds to say that

3566
00:57:48,309 --> 00:57:48,319
did it take you 15 seconds to say that
 

3567
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:50,069
did it take you 15 seconds to say that
yeah to come up with that also no i've

3568
00:57:50,069 --> 00:57:50,079
yeah to come up with that also no i've
 

3569
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,230
yeah to come up with that also no i've
thought about that before okay a good

3570
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:52,240
thought about that before okay a good
 

3571
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,190
thought about that before okay a good

not making fun i'm having fun there's a
 

3577

and there's a causal history to that fun

3584
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:05,200
and there's a causal history to that fun
 

3585
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,069
and there's a causal history to that fun
um

3586
00:58:06,069 --> 00:58:06,079
um
 

3587
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:07,990
um
you mentioned that there's no way to

3588
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:08,000
you mentioned that there's no way to
 

3589
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,470
you mentioned that there's no way to
communicate with aliens until

3590
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:10,480
communicate with aliens until
 

3591
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,069
communicate with aliens until
there's overlap in the causal craft

3592
00:58:14,069 --> 00:58:14,079
there's overlap in the causal craft
 

3593
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:15,670
there's overlap in the causal craft
communication

3594
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:15,680
communication
 

3595
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,470
communication
includes being able to see them

3596
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:18,480
includes being able to see them
 

3597
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,630
includes being able to see them
and like what are we

3598
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:20,640
and like what are we
 

3599
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,390
and like what are we
this is the question is

3600
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:22,400
this is the question is
 

3601
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,589
this is the question is
um

3602
00:58:23,589 --> 00:58:23,599
um
 

3603
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:26,230
um
is communication any kind of detection

3604
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:26,240
is communication any kind of detection
 

3605
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,910
is communication any kind of detection
and if so

3606
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:27,920
and if so
 

3607
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,870
and if so
what do aliens look like as you get more

3608
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:30,880
what do aliens look like as you get more
 

3609
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,950
what do aliens look like as you get more
and more overlap on the cause of gravity

3610
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:32,960
and more overlap on the cause of gravity
 

3611
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,190
and more overlap on the cause of gravity
you're assuming let's assume

3612
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:35,200
you're assuming let's assume
 

3613
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,750
you're assuming let's assume
that so when you see them when they see

3614
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:37,760
that so when you see them when they see
 

3615
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:38,950
that so when you see them when they see
you

3616
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:38,960
you
 

3617
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,789
you
you're assuming they have vision they

3618
00:58:40,789 --> 00:58:40,799
you're assuming they have vision they
 

3619
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:42,950
you're assuming they have vision they
have the ability to construct in 3d and

3620
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:42,960
have the ability to construct in 3d and
 

3621
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,870
have the ability to construct in 3d and
in time there's a lot of assumptions

3622
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:44,880
in time there's a lot of assumptions
 

3623
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,630
in time there's a lot of assumptions
we're making what detection all right

3624
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:46,640
we're making what detection all right
 

3625
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:49,030
we're making what detection all right
let's step back so yes okay you're right

3626
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:49,040
let's step back so yes okay you're right
 

3627
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,789
let's step back so yes okay you're right
so when in the english language when we

3628
00:58:50,789 --> 00:58:50,799
so when in the english language when we
 

3629
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:53,349
so when in the english language when we
say the word see we mean visually they

3630
00:58:53,349 --> 00:58:53,359
say the word see we mean visually they
 

3631
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:55,190
say the word see we mean visually they
show up to a party it's like oh wow

3632
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:55,200
show up to a party it's like oh wow
 

3633
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,670
show up to a party it's like oh wow
that's an alien that's visual that's 3d

3634
00:58:57,670 --> 00:58:57,680
that's an alien that's visual that's 3d
 

3635
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:58,710
that's an alien that's visual that's 3d
that's

3636
00:58:58,710 --> 00:58:58,720
that's
 

3637
00:58:58,720 --> 00:58:59,750
that's
okay

3638
00:58:59,750 --> 00:58:59,760
okay
 

3639
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:03,030
okay
and that's also assuming scale

3640
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:03,040
and that's also assuming scale
 

3641
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,870
and that's also assuming scale
spatial scale of something that's

3642
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:04,880
spatial scale of something that's
 

3643
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,390
spatial scale of something that's
visible to you so it can't be

3644
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:06,400
visible to you so it can't be
 

3645
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,390
visible to you so it can't be
microscopic or it can't be so big that

3646
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:08,400
microscopic or it can't be so big that
 

3647
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,630
microscopic or it can't be so big that
you don't even realize that's an entity

3648
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:10,640
you don't even realize that's an entity
 

3649
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,990
you don't even realize that's an entity
okay um but other kinds of detection too

3650
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:14,000
okay um but other kinds of detection too
 

3651
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,349
okay um but other kinds of detection too
i would make it more abstract and go

3652
00:59:15,349 --> 00:59:15,359
i would make it more abstract and go
 

3653
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:17,670
i would make it more abstract and go
down i was thinking this morning about

3654
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:17,680
down i was thinking this morning about
 

3655
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,670
down i was thinking this morning about
how to rewrite the arecibo message in

3656
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:19,680
how to rewrite the arecibo message in
 

3657
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,150
how to rewrite the arecibo message in
assembly theory and also to abandon

3658
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:22,160
assembly theory and also to abandon
 

3659
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,069
assembly theory and also to abandon
binary because i don't think aliens

3660
00:59:24,069 --> 00:59:24,079
binary because i don't think aliens
 

3661
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:27,030
binary because i don't think aliens
necessarily why should they have binary

3662
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:27,040
necessarily why should they have binary
 

3663
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,990
necessarily why should they have binary
well they have some basic elements with

3664
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:30,000
well they have some basic elements with
 

3665
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,950
well they have some basic elements with
which to to do information exchange

3666
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:32,960
which to to do information exchange
 

3667
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,870
which to to do information exchange
let's make it more

3668
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:34,880
let's make it more
 

3669
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,430
let's make it more
fundamental more universal so we need to

3670
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:37,440
fundamental more universal so we need to
 

3671
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,950
fundamental more universal so we need to
think about what is a universal way of

3672
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:38,960
think about what is a universal way of
 

3673
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,710
think about what is a universal way of
making a memory and then we should

3674
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:40,720
making a memory and then we should
 

3675
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,270
making a memory and then we should
re-encode arecibo in that way

3676
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:43,280
re-encode arecibo in that way
 

3677
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,510
re-encode arecibo in that way
what's more basic than zeros and ones

3678
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:45,520
what's more basic than zeros and ones
 

3679
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,349
what's more basic than zeros and ones
well it's really difficult to get out

3680
00:59:47,349 --> 00:59:47,359
well it's really difficult to get out
 

3681
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:49,589
well it's really difficult to get out
that causal chain because we're so let's

3682
00:59:49,589 --> 00:59:49,599
that causal chain because we're so let's
 

3683
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:51,750
that causal chain because we're so let's
raise the idea of zero for a moment it

3684
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:51,760
raise the idea of zero for a moment it
 

3685
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,430
raise the idea of zero for a moment it
took human beings a long time to come up

3686
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:53,440
took human beings a long time to come up
 

3687
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,190
took human beings a long time to come up
with the idea of zero now now you've got

3688
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:55,200
with the idea of zero now now you've got
 

3689
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,630
with the idea of zero now now you've got
the idea of zero you can't throw it away

3690
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:56,640
the idea of zero you can't throw it away
 

3691
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,950
the idea of zero you can't throw it away
it's so useful to discover the idea yeah

3692
00:59:58,950 --> 00:59:58,960
it's so useful to discover the idea yeah
 

3693
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,630
it's so useful to discover the idea yeah
to discover an event

3694
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:00,640
to discover an event
 

3695
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,630
to discover an event
i don't know but it took a long time so

3696
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:02,640
i don't know but it took a long time so
 

3697
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,510
i don't know but it took a long time so
it was

3698
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:03,520
it was
 

3699
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,910
it was
invented that's right yeah i think zero

3700
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:05,920

was invented so exactly so it's not a

01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:13,440
that's the one the massive assumption

that's the one the massive assumption

01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:23,040
want to meet him and ask him
 

3717
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,430
want to meet him and ask him
for a shortcut but you won't be able to

01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:25,440
for a shortcut but you won't be able to
 

3719
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,470
for a shortcut but you won't be able to
um ask him until what so i interrupted

01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:28,480
um ask him until what so i interrupted
 

3721
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,510

01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:43,520
change how do we so
 

3737
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,190
change how do we so
oh i don't know what it's like to be an

01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:45,200
oh i don't know what it's like to be an
 

3739
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,270
oh i don't know what it's like to be an
alien i would like to know

3740
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:47,280
alien i would like to know
 

3741
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,309
alien i would like to know
what is the full spectrum of what aliens

3742
01:00:50,309 --> 01:00:50,319
what is the full spectrum of what aliens
 

3743
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:51,510
what is the full spectrum of what aliens
might look like

3744
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:51,520
might look like
 

3745
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,109
might look like
to us

3746
01:00:53,109 --> 01:00:53,119
to us
 

3747
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:55,589
to us
now that we've laid this all on

now that we've laid this all on
 

3749
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:58,069
now that we've laid this all on
on the table of like all right so there

01:00:58,069 --> 01:00:58,079
on the table of like all right so there
 

3751
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:00,950
on the table of like all right so there
has to be some overlap and this

has to be some overlap and this

01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,109
do you think we should be looking for so
you met you mentioned mass spec

01:01:24,549 --> 01:01:24,559
cut ourselves a break let's assume that

01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,069
cut ourselves a break let's assume that
they are

they are

there are a size that we can recognize

01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:32,799
there are a size that we can recognize
 

3783
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,910
there are a size that we can recognize
let's give our cut ourselves a break

3784
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:33,920
let's give our cut ourselves a break
 

3785
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,510
let's give our cut ourselves a break
because there could be aliens that are

3786
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:35,520
because there could be aliens that are
 

3787
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,670
because there could be aliens that are
so big we don't recognize we're seeing

3788
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:37,680
so big we don't recognize we're seeing
 

3789
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:38,950
so big we don't recognize we're seeing
them there might be aliens that are so

3790
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:38,960
them there might be aliens that are so
 

3791
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,549
them there might be aliens that are so
small we don't yet have the ability to

3792
01:01:40,549 --> 01:01:40,559
small we don't yet have the ability to
 

3793
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:42,549
small we don't yet have the ability to
you know we have microscopes we can see

3794
01:01:42,549 --> 01:01:42,559
you know we have microscopes we can see
 

3795
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:44,230
you know we have microscopes we can see
you know far enough away that just

3796
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:44,240
you know far enough away that just
 

3797
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,750
you know far enough away that just
wouldn't be i see them so that's a good

3798
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:45,760
wouldn't be i see them so that's a good
 

3799
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,910
wouldn't be i see them so that's a good
range so let's just make a range let's

3800
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:47,920
range so let's just make a range let's
 

3801
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,309
range so let's just make a range let's
just be very am for eccentric and say

3802
01:01:50,309 --> 01:01:50,319
just be very am for eccentric and say
 

3803
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:51,829
just be very am for eccentric and say
we're gonna look for aliens roughly our

3804
01:01:51,829 --> 01:01:51,839
we're gonna look for aliens roughly our
 

3805
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:54,470
we're gonna look for aliens roughly our
size and technology our size because we

3806
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:54,480
size and technology our size because we
 

3807
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,309
size and technology our size because we
we know it's possible on earth right i

3808
01:01:56,309 --> 01:01:56,319
we know it's possible on earth right i
 

3809
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:57,510
we know it's possible on earth right i
mean a reasonable thing to do would be

3810
01:01:57,510 --> 01:01:57,520
mean a reasonable thing to do would be
 

3811
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,990
mean a reasonable thing to do would be
to to find exoplanets that in the same

3812
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:00,000
to to find exoplanets that in the same
 

3813
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,029
to to find exoplanets that in the same
zone as earth in terms of heat and stuff

3814
01:02:03,029 --> 01:02:03,039
zone as earth in terms of heat and stuff
 

3815
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:04,150
zone as earth in terms of heat and stuff
and then say

3816
01:02:04,150 --> 01:02:04,160
and then say
 

3817
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,150
and then say
hey if there's that same kind of gravity

3818
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:06,160
hey if there's that same kind of gravity
 

3819
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,549
hey if there's that same kind of gravity
same type of stuff we could reasonably

3820
01:02:08,549 --> 01:02:08,559
same type of stuff we could reasonably
 

3821
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:09,670
same type of stuff we could reasonably
assume

3822
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:09,680
assume
 

3823
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:12,950
assume
that the alien life there might use a

3824
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:12,960
that the alien life there might use a
 

3825
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,829
that the alien life there might use a
similar kind of physical infrastructure

3826
01:02:15,829 --> 01:02:15,839
similar kind of physical infrastructure
 

3827
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:17,589
similar kind of physical infrastructure
and then we're good so then then you'll

3828
01:02:17,589 --> 01:02:17,599
and then we're good so then then you'll
 

3829
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,029
and then we're good so then then you'll
then then your question becomes really

3830
01:02:19,029 --> 01:02:19,039
then then your question becomes really
 

3831
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:20,789
then then your question becomes really
relevant and say right let's use vision

3832
01:02:20,789 --> 01:02:20,799
relevant and say right let's use vision
 

3833
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:23,190
relevant and say right let's use vision
sound touch

3834
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:23,200
sound touch
 

3835
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,950
sound touch
and and so okay that's really nice so

3836
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:24,960
and and so okay that's really nice so
 

3837
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,710
and and so okay that's really nice so
that if there's a lot of aliens out

3838
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:26,720
that if there's a lot of aliens out
 

3839
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,630
that if there's a lot of aliens out
there

3840
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:28,640
there
 

3841
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,109
there
if there's a good likelihood if you

3842
01:02:31,109 --> 01:02:31,119
if there's a good likelihood if you
 

3843
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:33,109
if there's a good likelihood if you
match to the planet that they're going

3844
01:02:33,109 --> 01:02:33,119
match to the planet that they're going
 

3845
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:36,950
match to the planet that they're going
to be in the same spatial and temporal

01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:36,960
to be in the same spatial and temporal

what did they look like
 

3857
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:49,510
what did they look like
visually what do they sound like

3858
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:49,520
visually what do they sound like
 

3859
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,430
visually what do they sound like
uh what are they oh god this sounds

3860
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:51,440
uh what are they oh god this sounds
 

3861
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,109
uh what are they oh god this sounds
creepy tastes like

3862
01:02:53,109 --> 01:02:53,119
creepy tastes like
 

3863
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:54,710
creepy tastes like
what is it

3864
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:54,720
what is it
 

3865
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,630
what is it
oh it smells like smell like that sounds

3866
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:56,640
oh it smells like smell like that sounds
 

3867
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:57,990
oh it smells like smell like that sounds
like our clubhouse and he's like can we

3868
01:02:57,990 --> 01:02:58,000
like our clubhouse and he's like can we
 

3869
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,150
like our clubhouse and he's like can we
have sex with aliens which was basically

3870
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:00,160
have sex with aliens which was basically
 

3871
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:01,910
have sex with aliens which was basically
me saying passionate love but it wasn't

3872
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:01,920
me saying passionate love but it wasn't
 

3873
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,510
me saying passionate love but it wasn't
actually about sex it was about is our

3874
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:03,520
actually about sex it was about is our
 

3875
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,670
actually about sex it was about is our
chemistry compatible right is there some

3876
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:05,680
chemistry compatible right is there some
 

3877
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:09,829
chemistry compatible right is there some
yeah so yeah yeah can can we um yeah are

3878
01:03:09,829 --> 01:03:09,839
yeah so yeah yeah can can we um yeah are
 

3879
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:11,430
yeah so yeah yeah can can we um yeah are
they edible too they could be very

3880
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:11,440
they edible too they could be very
 

3881
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,190
they edible too they could be very
edible they could be delicious that's

3882
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:13,200
edible they could be delicious that's
 

3883
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,549
edible they could be delicious that's
why i want to see some aliens right

3884
01:03:14,549 --> 01:03:14,559
why i want to see some aliens right
 

3885
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:16,549
why i want to see some aliens right
because i think are there i think

3886
01:03:16,549 --> 01:03:16,559
because i think are there i think
 

3887
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:17,829
because i think are there i think
evolution

3888
01:03:17,829 --> 01:03:17,839
evolution
 

3889
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:19,430
evolution
um

3890
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:19,440
um
 

3891
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,430
um
i mean evolution exploits symmetry right

3892
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:21,440
i mean evolution exploits symmetry right
 

3893
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,430
i mean evolution exploits symmetry right
because why why generate memory why

3894
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:23,440
because why why generate memory why
 

3895
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,430
because why why generate memory why
generate storage the need for storage

3896
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:25,440
generate storage the need for storage
 

3897
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,510
generate storage the need for storage
space when you can use symmetry

3898
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:27,520
space when you can use symmetry
 

3899
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,309
space when you can use symmetry
so

3900
01:03:28,309 --> 01:03:28,319
so
 

3901
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:29,910
so
and symmetry is quite maybe quite

3902
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:29,920
and symmetry is quite maybe quite
 

3903
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:30,950
and symmetry is quite maybe quite
effective in allowing you to

3904
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:30,960
effective in allowing you to
 

3905
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,870
effective in allowing you to
mechanically design stuff right

3906
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:32,880
mechanically design stuff right
 

3907
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,109
mechanically design stuff right
so maybe alien it could you could be

3908
01:03:35,109 --> 01:03:35,119
so maybe alien it could you could be
 

3909
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:36,710
so maybe alien it could you could be
reasonable to assume that aliens could

3910
01:03:36,710 --> 01:03:36,720
reasonable to assume that aliens could
 

3911
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:37,910
reasonable to assume that aliens could
have

3912
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:37,920
have
 

3913
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,230
have
they could be bipedal they could be

3914
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:40,240
they could be bipedal they could be
 

3915
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,230
they could be bipedal they could be
symmetric in the same way

3916
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:42,240
symmetric in the same way
 

3917
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,069
symmetric in the same way
might have a couple of eyes or a couple

3918
01:03:44,069 --> 01:03:44,079
might have a couple of eyes or a couple
 

3919
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:46,069
might have a couple of eyes or a couple
of sensors well we can make make that

3920
01:03:46,069 --> 01:03:46,079
of sensors well we can make make that
 

3921
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:47,910
of sensors well we can make make that
and perhaps there's this whole zoo of

3922
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:47,920
and perhaps there's this whole zoo of
 

3923
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,109
and perhaps there's this whole zoo of
different aliens out there and we'll

3924
01:03:49,109 --> 01:03:49,119
different aliens out there and we'll
 

3925
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:50,789
different aliens out there and we'll
never get to be able to classify some of

3926
01:03:50,789 --> 01:03:50,799
never get to be able to classify some of
 

3927
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:52,470
never get to be able to classify some of
the weird aliens we can't interact with

3928
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:52,480
the weird aliens we can't interact with
 

3929
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,109
the weird aliens we can't interact with
because they have made such weird stuff

3930
01:03:55,109 --> 01:03:55,119
because they have made such weird stuff
 

3931
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:57,029
because they have made such weird stuff
yeah but we are just going to look at

3932
01:03:57,029 --> 01:03:57,039
yeah but we are just going to look at
 

3933
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:58,230
yeah but we are just going to look at
we're going to find aliens that look

3934
01:03:58,230 --> 01:03:58,240
we're going to find aliens that look
 

3935
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,230
we're going to find aliens that look
most like us why not

3936
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:00,240
most like us why not
 

3937
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,430
most like us why not
because those are the first ones we're

3938
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:01,440
because those are the first ones we're
 

3939
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,230
because those are the first ones we're
likely to see yeah yeah but i i think

3940
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:04,240
likely to see yeah yeah but i i think
 

3941
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,230
likely to see yeah yeah but i i think
it's really hard to imagine what the

3942
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:06,240
it's really hard to imagine what the
 

3943
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,549
it's really hard to imagine what the
space of aliens is because the space is

3944
01:04:08,549 --> 01:04:08,559
space of aliens is because the space is
 

3945
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:10,630
space of aliens is because the space is
huge because you know like one of the

3946
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:10,640
huge because you know like one of the
 

3947
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:11,829
huge because you know like one of the
arguments that you can make about why

3948
01:04:11,829 --> 01:04:11,839
arguments that you can make about why
 

3949
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:13,510
arguments that you can make about why
life emerges in chemistry is because

3950
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:13,520
life emerges in chemistry is because
 

3951
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,630
life emerges in chemistry is because
chemistry

3952
01:04:14,630 --> 01:04:14,640
chemistry
 

3953
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:15,910
chemistry
is the first

3954
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:15,920
is the first
 

3955
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,069
is the first
scale in terms of like you know building

3956
01:04:18,069 --> 01:04:18,079
scale in terms of like you know building
 

3957
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:20,150
scale in terms of like you know building
up objects from elementary objects

3958
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:20,160
up objects from elementary objects
 

3959
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,270
up objects from elementary objects
um

3960
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:21,280
um
 

3961
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,789
um
that the number of possible things that

3962
01:04:22,789 --> 01:04:22,799
that the number of possible things that
 

3963
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:24,309
that the number of possible things that
could exist is larger than the universe

3964
01:04:24,309 --> 01:04:24,319
could exist is larger than the universe
 

3965
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,710
could exist is larger than the universe
can possibly make all at once right so

3966
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:26,720
can possibly make all at once right so
 

3967
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:27,589
can possibly make all at once right so
um

3968
01:04:27,589 --> 01:04:27,599
um
 

3969
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:29,589
um
so you imagine you have two planets and

3970
01:04:29,589 --> 01:04:29,599
so you imagine you have two planets and
 

3971
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,670
so you imagine you have two planets and
they're cooking some geochemistry you

3972
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:31,680
they're cooking some geochemistry you
 

3973
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,430
they're cooking some geochemistry you
know our planet invented one kind of

3974
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:33,440
know our planet invented one kind of
 

3975
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,630
know our planet invented one kind of
biochemistry and presumably as you start

3976
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:36,640
biochemistry and presumably as you start
 

3977
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:37,670
biochemistry and presumably as you start
building up the complexity of the

3978
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:37,680
building up the complexity of the
 

3979
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:40,309
building up the complexity of the
molecules the chances of the overlap in

3980
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:40,319
molecules the chances of the overlap in
 

3981
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:41,990
molecules the chances of the overlap in
those trajectories those causal chains

3982
01:04:41,990 --> 01:04:42,000
those trajectories those causal chains
 

3983
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,309
those trajectories those causal chains
being built up is probably very low

3984
01:04:44,309 --> 01:04:44,319
being built up is probably very low
 

3985
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:46,390
being built up is probably very low
um and it gets lower and lower as it

3986
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:46,400
um and it gets lower and lower as it
 

3987
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,150
um and it gets lower and lower as it
gets further advanced along its

3988
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:48,160
gets further advanced along its
 

3989
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,670
gets further advanced along its
evolutionary path so i think it's very

3990
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:49,680
evolutionary path so i think it's very
 

3991
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:50,950
evolutionary path so i think it's very
difficult to

3992
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:50,960
difficult to
 

3993
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,789
difficult to
imagine predicting the technologies that

3994
01:04:52,789 --> 01:04:52,799
imagine predicting the technologies that
 

3995
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:54,390
imagine predicting the technologies that
aliens are going to have

3996
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:54,400
aliens are going to have
 

3997
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,470
aliens are going to have
i mean it's it's so it's you're looking

3998
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:56,480
i mean it's it's so it's you're looking
 

3999
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,549
i mean it's it's so it's you're looking
at basically planets have kind of

4000
01:04:58,549 --> 01:04:58,559
at basically planets have kind of
 

4001
01:04:58,559 --> 01:04:59,990
at basically planets have kind of
convergent chemistry but there's some

4002
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:00,000
convergent chemistry but there's some
 

4003
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,349
convergent chemistry but there's some
variability and then you're looking

4004
01:05:01,349 --> 01:05:01,359
variability and then you're looking
 

4005
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:02,870
variability and then you're looking
basically at the outgrowth into the

4006
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:02,880
basically at the outgrowth into the
 

4007
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,710
basically at the outgrowth into the
possibility space chemistry so do you

4008
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:04,720
possibility space chemistry so do you
 

4009
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:07,349
possibility space chemistry so do you
think it would detect the the technology

4010
01:05:07,349 --> 01:05:07,359
think it would detect the the technology
 

4011
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:09,589
think it would detect the the technology
the objects created by aliens before we

4012
01:05:09,589 --> 01:05:09,599
the objects created by aliens before we
 

4013
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:11,430
the objects created by aliens before we
detect the aliens

4014
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:11,440
detect the aliens
 

4015
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,109
detect the aliens
possibly so when you're talking about

4016
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:13,119
possibly so when you're talking about
 

4017
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:15,190
possibly so when you're talking about
measuring assembly index

4018
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:15,200
measuring assembly index
 

4019
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,670
measuring assembly index
um don't you think we would detect the

4020
01:05:17,670 --> 01:05:17,680
um don't you think we would detect the
 

4021
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,109
um don't you think we would detect the
garbage first

4022
01:05:19,109 --> 01:05:19,119
garbage first
 

4023
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:20,870
garbage first
like at the outskirts of alien

4024
01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:20,880
like at the outskirts of alien
 

4025
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,470
like at the outskirts of alien
civilizations is this is going to be

4026
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:22,480
civilizations is this is going to be
 

4027
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,530
civilizations is this is going to be

i think i would come back to arecibo the

4032
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:28,000
i think i would come back to arecibo the
 

4033
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,750
i think i would come back to arecibo the
arecibo message sent from the arecibo

4034
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:29,760
arecibo message sent from the arecibo
 

4035
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,430

01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:31,440
telescope built by
 

4037
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,670
telescope built by
drake i think and and sagan how's

4038
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:33,680
drake i think and and sagan how's
 

4039
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,870
drake i think and and sagan how's
arecibo spelled

4040
01:05:35,870 --> 01:05:35,880
arecibo spelled
 

4041
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:38,309
arecibo spelled
a-r-e-c-i-b-o yes thank you

4042
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:38,319
a-r-e-c-i-b-o yes thank you
 

4043
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:39,829
a-r-e-c-i-b-o yes thank you
yeah and there we go out there that

4044
01:05:39,829 --> 01:05:39,839
yeah and there we go out there that
 

4045
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,349
yeah and there we go out there that
that's the telescope that sent the

4046
01:05:41,349 --> 01:05:41,359
that's the telescope that sent the
 

4047
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:43,029
that's the telescope that sent the
message that you're doing so that

4048
01:05:43,029 --> 01:05:43,039
message that you're doing so that
 

4049
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,630
message that you're doing so that
message was sent

4050
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:44,640
message was sent
 

4051
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,190
message was sent
where it was beamed it beamed at a star

4052
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:47,200
where it was beamed it beamed at a star
 

4053
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,349
where it was beamed it beamed at a star
of a specific star um and it was sent

4054
01:05:49,349 --> 01:05:49,359
of a specific star um and it was sent
 

4055
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:52,150
of a specific star um and it was sent
out many years ago um

4056
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:52,160
out many years ago um
 

4057
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,069
out many years ago um
and what they did so this is why i was

4058
01:05:54,069 --> 01:05:54,079
and what they did so this is why i was
 

4059
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:56,870
and what they did so this is why i was
pushing on binary is a binary message

4060
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:56,880
pushing on binary is a binary message
 

4061
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,029
pushing on binary is a binary message
i think it's a semi-prime

4062
01:05:59,029 --> 01:05:59,039
i think it's a semi-prime
 

4063
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,750
i think it's a semi-prime
number of characters so i think 20 73 by

4064
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:01,760
number of characters so i think 20 73 by
 

4065
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,029
number of characters so i think 20 73 by
23

4066
01:06:03,029 --> 01:06:03,039
23
 

4067
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:04,950
23
i think and it basically represents

4068
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:04,960
i think and it basically represents
 

4069
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,549
i think and it basically represents
human bit proton

4070
01:06:06,549 --> 01:06:06,559
human bit proton
 

4071
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:09,430
human bit proton
um binary human beings dna male and

4072
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:09,440
um binary human beings dna male and
 

4073
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:10,390
um binary human beings dna male and
female

4074
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:10,400
female
 

4075
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,470
female
and it's it's really cool

4076
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:12,480
and it's it's really cool
 

4077
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:16,870
and it's it's really cool
but i'm just wondering if um it could be

4078
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:16,880
but i'm just wondering if um it could be
 

4079
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,470
but i'm just wondering if um it could be
done

4080
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:18,480
done
 

4081
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,150

not making any because he's made

4082
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:20,160
not making any because he's made
 

4083
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,950
not making any because he's made
assumptions that aliens speak binary

4084
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:22,960
assumptions that aliens speak binary
 

4085
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,190
assumptions that aliens speak binary
make that assumption why not just assume

4086
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:25,200
make that assumption why not just assume
 

4087
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,510
make that assumption why not just assume
that if the difference between physics

4088
01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:27,520
that if the difference between physics
 

4089
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,029
that if the difference between physics
chemistry and biology is the amount of

4090
01:06:29,029 --> 01:06:29,039
chemistry and biology is the amount of
 

4091
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:31,670
chemistry and biology is the amount of
memory that's instead that's recordable

4092
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:31,680
memory that's instead that's recordable
 

4093
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,750

01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:37,029
by the substrate
then surely the universal thing my i'm

4096
01:06:37,029 --> 01:06:37,039
then surely the universal thing my i'm
 

4097
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:38,390
then surely the universal thing my i'm
going to make some sacrilegious

4098
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:38,400
going to make some sacrilegious
 

4099
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,910
going to make some sacrilegious
statement which i think is pretty

4100
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:39,920
statement which i think is pretty
 

4101
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,470
statement which i think is pretty
awesome um for people to argue with so

4102
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:42,480
awesome um for people to argue with so
 

4103
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,630
awesome um for people to argue with so
this is uh we're looking at an image

4104
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:44,640
this is uh we're looking at an image
 

4105
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,190
this is uh we're looking at an image
where it's the the entirety of the

4106
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:47,200
where it's the the entirety of the
 

4107
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,589
where it's the the entirety of the
message encoded in binary

4108
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:49,599
message encoded in binary
 

4109
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:51,430
message encoded in binary
and then there's a probably

4110
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:51,440
and then there's a probably
 

4111
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,789
and then there's a probably
interpretation of different parts of

4112
01:06:52,789 --> 01:06:52,799
interpretation of different parts of
 

4113
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:55,589
interpretation of different parts of
that image there's a there's a person

4114
01:06:55,589 --> 01:06:55,599
that image there's a there's a person
 

4115
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:58,710
that image there's a there's a person
um there's green parts it looks like for

4116
01:06:58,710 --> 01:06:58,720
um there's green parts it looks like for
 

4117
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,390
um there's green parts it looks like for
people just listening like a tetra game

4118
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:00,400
people just listening like a tetra game
 

4119
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,029
people just listening like a tetra game
of tetris so it's encoding in minimal

4120
01:07:03,029 --> 01:07:03,039
of tetris so it's encoding in minimal
 

4121
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,789
of tetris so it's encoding in minimal
ways a bunch of cool information

4122
01:07:04,789 --> 01:07:04,799
ways a bunch of cool information
 

4123
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:06,950
ways a bunch of cool information
probably representing all of us so the

4124
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:06,960
probably representing all of us so the
 

4125
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,309
probably representing all of us so the
top it's kind of teaching us how to

4126
01:07:08,309 --> 01:07:08,319
top it's kind of teaching us how to
 

4127
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:09,910
top it's kind of teaching us how to
count and then all goes all the way down

4128
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:09,920
count and then all goes all the way down
 

4129
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,349
count and then all goes all the way down
teaching you chemistry and then just

4130
01:07:11,349 --> 01:07:11,359
teaching you chemistry and then just
 

4131
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:12,150
teaching you chemistry and then just
says

4132
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:12,160
says
 

4133
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,309
says
but it makes so many assumptions and i

4134
01:07:14,309 --> 01:07:14,319
but it makes so many assumptions and i
 

4135
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:16,789
but it makes so many assumptions and i
think if we can actually so

4136
01:07:16,789 --> 01:07:16,799
think if we can actually so
 

4137
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:18,630
think if we can actually so
i think i mean sarah's much more

4138
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:18,640
i think i mean sarah's much more
 

4139
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,150
i think i mean sarah's much more
eloquent expressing this but i'll have a

4140
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:20,160
eloquent expressing this but i'll have a
 

4141
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,750
eloquent expressing this but i'll have a
go and you can correct it if you want

4142
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:21,760
go and you can correct it if you want
 

4143
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,150
go and you can correct it if you want
which is like um we one of the things

4144
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:24,160
which is like um we one of the things
 

4145
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,309
which is like um we one of the things
that sarah has had a profound effect on

4146
01:07:26,309 --> 01:07:26,319
that sarah has had a profound effect on
 

4147
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:27,670
that sarah has had a profound effect on
the way i

4148
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:27,680
the way i
 

4149
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,670
the way i
look at the origin of life and this is

4150
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:29,680
look at the origin of life and this is
 

4151
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,109
look at the origin of life and this is
one of the reasons why we're working

4152
01:07:31,109 --> 01:07:31,119
one of the reasons why we're working
 

4153
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:32,309
one of the reasons why we're working
together because

4154
01:07:32,309 --> 01:07:32,319
together because
 

4155
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:33,829
together because
we don't really care about the origin of

4156
01:07:33,829 --> 01:07:33,839
we don't really care about the origin of
 

4157
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:36,309
we don't really care about the origin of
life we want to make life make aliens

4158
01:07:36,309 --> 01:07:36,319
life we want to make life make aliens
 

4159
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,710
life we want to make life make aliens
and find aliens make aliens find aliens

4160
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:38,720
and find aliens make aliens find aliens
 

4161
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,309
and find aliens make aliens find aliens
i think we might have to make aliens in

4162
01:07:40,309 --> 01:07:40,319
i think we might have to make aliens in
 

4163
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:41,670
i think we might have to make aliens in
the lab before we find aliens in the

4164
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:41,680
the lab before we find aliens in the
 

4165
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,510
the lab before we find aliens in the
universe right i think that would be a

4166
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:43,520
universe right i think that would be a
 

4167
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,270
universe right i think that would be a
cool way to do it

4168
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:45,280
cool way to do it
 

4169
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,950
cool way to do it
so what is it about the universe that

4170
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:46,960
so what is it about the universe that
 

4171
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:50,390
so what is it about the universe that
creates a aliens well it's selection

4172
01:07:50,390 --> 01:07:50,400
creates a aliens well it's selection
 

4173
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,829
creates a aliens well it's selection
through assembly theory creating

4174
01:07:51,829 --> 01:07:51,839
through assembly theory creating
 

4175
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:53,109
through assembly theory creating
memories because when you create

4176
01:07:53,109 --> 01:07:53,119
memories because when you create
 

4177
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:56,309
memories because when you create
memories you can then command

4178
01:07:56,309 --> 01:07:56,319
memories you can then command
 

4179
01:07:56,319 --> 01:07:58,230
memories you can then command
your domain you can basically do stuff

4180
01:07:58,230 --> 01:07:58,240
your domain you can basically do stuff
 

4181
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,630
your domain you can basically do stuff
you can command matter

4182
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:00,640
you can command matter
 

4183
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,309
you can command matter
so we need to find a way by

4184
01:08:02,309 --> 01:08:02,319
so we need to find a way by
 

4185
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:04,309
so we need to find a way by
understanding what life is of how the

4186
01:08:04,309 --> 01:08:04,319
understanding what life is of how the
 

4187
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:06,069
understanding what life is of how the
minimal way to command matter how that

4188
01:08:06,069 --> 01:08:06,079
minimal way to command matter how that
 

4189
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:07,990
minimal way to command matter how that
would emerge in the universe

4190
01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:08,000
would emerge in the universe
 

4191
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,990
would emerge in the universe
and be if we want to communicate i mean

4192
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:10,000
and be if we want to communicate i mean
 

4193
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,349
and be if we want to communicate i mean
maybe we don't want to necessarily

4194
01:08:11,349 --> 01:08:11,359
maybe we don't want to necessarily
 

4195
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:12,950
maybe we don't want to necessarily
uniformly communicate

4196
01:08:12,950 --> 01:08:12,960
uniformly communicate
 

4197
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,349
uniformly communicate
um what i would do perhaps if i had is i

4198
01:08:15,349 --> 01:08:15,359
um what i would do perhaps if i had is i
 

4199
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:17,269
um what i would do perhaps if i had is i
would send out lots of probes

4200
01:08:17,269 --> 01:08:17,279
would send out lots of probes
 

4201
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,870
would send out lots of probes
away from earth that have this magic way

4202
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:18,880
away from earth that have this magic way
 

4203
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,229
away from earth that have this magic way
of communicating with aliens get them

4204
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:20,239
of communicating with aliens get them
 

4205
01:08:20,239 --> 01:08:22,149
of communicating with aliens get them
quite far away from earth

4206
01:08:22,149 --> 01:08:22,159
quite far away from earth
 

4207
01:08:22,159 --> 01:08:24,630
quite far away from earth
plausibly deniable and then send out the

4208
01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:24,640
plausibly deniable and then send out the
 

4209
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,550
plausibly deniable and then send out the
message that would then attract all the

4210
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:26,560
message that would then attract all the
 

4211
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,390
message that would then attract all the
aliens and then basically work out if

4212
01:08:28,390 --> 01:08:28,400
aliens and then basically work out if
 

4213
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:29,990
aliens and then basically work out if
they're a friend or foe and how they

4214
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:30,000
they're a friend or foe and how they
 

4215
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,590
they're a friend or foe and how they
want to hang out the messages being

4216
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:31,600
want to hang out the messages being
 

4217
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,590
want to hang out the messages being
something has to do with the memory yes

4218
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:33,600
something has to do with the memory yes
 

4219
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,630
something has to do with the memory yes
like the the assembly version of arecibo

4220
01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:36,640
like the the assembly version of arecibo
 

4221
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,390
like the the assembly version of arecibo
so that everyone in the universe that

4222
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:38,400
so that everyone in the universe that
 

4223
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,870
so that everyone in the universe that
has been understands what life is

4224
01:08:40,870 --> 01:08:40,880
has been understands what life is
 

4225
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,110
has been understands what life is
so aliens need to work out what they are

4226
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:43,120
so aliens need to work out what they are
 

4227
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,630
so aliens need to work out what they are
once they've worked out what they are

4228
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:44,640
once they've worked out what they are
 

4229
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,070
once they've worked out what they are
they then can work out how to encode

4230
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:46,080
they then can work out how to encode
 

4231
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,749
they then can work out how to encode
what they are and then they can go out

4232
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:47,759
what they are and then they can go out
 

4233
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:48,950
what they are and then they can go out
and send messages it's like the

4234
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:48,960
and send messages it's like the
 

4235
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:52,789
and send messages it's like the
universal um the rosetta stone

4236
01:08:52,789 --> 01:08:52,799
universal um the rosetta stone
 

4237
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:55,110
universal um the rosetta stone
for life in the universe

4238
01:08:55,110 --> 01:08:55,120
for life in the universe
 

4239
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,470
for life in the universe
is working out how the memories are

4240
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:56,480
is working out how the memories are
 

4241
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:58,470
is working out how the memories are
built i don't know if sarah you have any

4242
01:08:58,470 --> 01:08:58,480
built i don't know if sarah you have any
 

4243
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,070
built i don't know if sarah you have any
well

4244
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:00,080
well
 

4245
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:00,950
well
um

4246
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:00,960
um
 

4247
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,789
um
whether that you would agree with that

4248
01:09:02,789 --> 01:09:02,799
whether that you would agree with that
 

4249
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:05,269
whether that you would agree with that
no i i i wanted to raise a different

4250
01:09:05,269 --> 01:09:05,279
no i i i wanted to raise a different
 

4251
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:08,309
no i i i wanted to raise a different
point which is about the fact that we

4252
01:09:08,309 --> 01:09:08,319
point which is about the fact that we
 

4253
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:09,590
point which is about the fact that we
can't see the aliens yet because we

4254
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:09,600
can't see the aliens yet because we
 

4255
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,510
can't see the aliens yet because we
haven't gotten the technology

4256
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:11,520
haven't gotten the technology
 

4257
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:13,910
haven't gotten the technology
and presumably we think assembly theory

4258
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:13,920
and presumably we think assembly theory
 

4259
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,349
and presumably we think assembly theory
is the right way of doing it but i don't

4260
01:09:15,349 --> 01:09:15,359
is the right way of doing it but i don't
 

4261
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:16,630
is the right way of doing it but i don't
think that we know how to go from the

4262
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:16,640
think that we know how to go from the
 

4263
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:19,110
think that we know how to go from the
kind of data you're describing lex like

4264
01:09:19,110 --> 01:09:19,120
kind of data you're describing lex like
 

4265
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,349
kind of data you're describing lex like
you know visual data or smell to

4266
01:09:21,349 --> 01:09:21,359
you know visual data or smell to
 

4267
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:23,669
you know visual data or smell to
construct the assembly spaces yet and in

4268
01:09:23,669 --> 01:09:23,679
construct the assembly spaces yet and in
 

4269
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:25,829
construct the assembly spaces yet and in
some ways i think that the problem of

4270
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:25,839
some ways i think that the problem of
 

4271
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:27,510
some ways i think that the problem of
life detection really is the same

4272
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:27,520
life detection really is the same
 

4273
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,470
life detection really is the same
problem at the foundations of ai that we

4274
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:30,480
problem at the foundations of ai that we
 

4275
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:33,910
problem at the foundations of ai that we
don't understand how to get machines to

4276
01:09:33,910 --> 01:09:33,920
don't understand how to get machines to
 

4277
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,749
don't understand how to get machines to
see causal graphs to see reality in

4278
01:09:35,749 --> 01:09:35,759
see causal graphs to see reality in
 

4279
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:37,189
see causal graphs to see reality in
terms of causation

4280
01:09:37,189 --> 01:09:37,199
terms of causation
 

4281
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:40,309
terms of causation
um and so i i think assembly and ai are

4282
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:40,319
um and so i i think assembly and ai are
 

4283
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:41,749
um and so i i think assembly and ai are
going to intersect in interesting ways

4284
01:09:41,749 --> 01:09:41,759
going to intersect in interesting ways
 

4285
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:42,789
going to intersect in interesting ways
hopefully

4286
01:09:42,789 --> 01:09:42,799
hopefully
 

4287
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:43,669
hopefully
um

4288
01:09:43,669 --> 01:09:43,679
um
 

4289
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,709
um
but the the sort of key point and i've

4290
01:09:46,709 --> 01:09:46,719
but the the sort of key point and i've
 

4291
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:47,990
but the the sort of key point and i've
been trying to make this argument more

4292
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:48,000
been trying to make this argument more
 

4293
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,110
been trying to make this argument more
recently

4294
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:49,120
recently
 

4295
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,189
recently
um and might write an essay on it is you

4296
01:09:51,189 --> 01:09:51,199
um and might write an essay on it is you
 

4297
01:09:51,199 --> 01:09:53,030
um and might write an essay on it is you
know people talk about the great filter

4298
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:53,040
know people talk about the great filter
 

4299
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,630
know people talk about the great filter
right and which is again this like

4300
01:09:54,630 --> 01:09:54,640
right and which is again this like
 

4301
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,229
right and which is again this like
doomsday thing that you know people want

4302
01:09:56,229 --> 01:09:56,239
doomsday thing that you know people want
 

4303
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:57,669
doomsday thing that you know people want
to say there's no aliens out there

4304
01:09:57,669 --> 01:09:57,679
to say there's no aliens out there
 

4305
01:09:57,679 --> 01:09:58,790
to say there's no aliens out there
because something terrible happened to

4306
01:09:58,790 --> 01:09:58,800
because something terrible happened to
 

4307
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,830
because something terrible happened to
them um and it matters whether that's in

4308
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:01,840
them um and it matters whether that's in
 

4309
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:04,149
them um and it matters whether that's in
our in our past or our future as to the

4310
01:10:04,149 --> 01:10:04,159
our in our past or our future as to the
 

4311
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:06,310
our in our past or our future as to the
longevity of our species presumably

4312
01:10:06,310 --> 01:10:06,320
longevity of our species presumably
 

4313
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,910
longevity of our species presumably
which is why people find it interesting

4314
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:07,920
which is why people find it interesting
 

4315
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:10,310
which is why people find it interesting
but i think it's not it's not a physical

4316
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:10,320
but i think it's not it's not a physical
 

4317
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,910
but i think it's not it's not a physical
filter it's not like things go extinct i

4318
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:11,920
filter it's not like things go extinct i
 

4319
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,030
filter it's not like things go extinct i
think it's literally we don't have the

4320
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:13,040
think it's literally we don't have the
 

4321
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,110
think it's literally we don't have the
technology to see them

4322
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:15,120
technology to see them
 

4323
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,870
technology to see them
um and you can see that with microscopes

4324
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:16,880
um and you can see that with microscopes
 

4325
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:17,669
um and you can see that with microscopes
i mean we didn't know there were

4326
01:10:17,669 --> 01:10:17,679
i mean we didn't know there were
 

4327
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:19,830
i mean we didn't know there were
microbes on this table for our tables

4328
01:10:19,830 --> 01:10:19,840
microbes on this table for our tables
 

4329
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,590
microbes on this table for our tables
for thousands of years or telescopes

4330
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:21,600
for thousands of years or telescopes
 

4331
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,790
for thousands of years or telescopes
like there's so much of the universe we

4332
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:22,800
like there's so much of the universe we
 

4333
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,310
like there's so much of the universe we
can't see and then basically what we

4334
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:24,320
can't see and then basically what we
 

4335
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,950
can't see and then basically what we
have done as a species is outsource our

4336
01:10:26,950 --> 01:10:26,960
have done as a species is outsource our
 

4337
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,110
have done as a species is outsource our
physical perceptions to technology

4338
01:10:29,110 --> 01:10:29,120
physical perceptions to technology
 

4339
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,189
physical perceptions to technology
building microscopes based on our eyes

4340
01:10:31,189 --> 01:10:31,199
building microscopes based on our eyes
 

4341
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:33,350
building microscopes based on our eyes
um you know and building seismometers

4342
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:33,360
um you know and building seismometers
 

4343
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,189
um you know and building seismometers
based on our sense of feelings like feel

4344
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:35,199
based on our sense of feelings like feel
 

4345
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:36,790
based on our sense of feelings like feel
earthquakes and things and ai is

4346
01:10:36,790 --> 01:10:36,800
earthquakes and things and ai is
 

4347
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:37,910
earthquakes and things and ai is
basically we're trying to outsource

4348
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:37,920
basically we're trying to outsource
 

4349
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,189
basically we're trying to outsource
what's actually happening in our

4350
01:10:39,189 --> 01:10:39,199
what's actually happening in our
 

4351
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:41,350
what's actually happening in our
thinking apparatus into machines now

4352
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:41,360
thinking apparatus into machines now
 

4353
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,510
thinking apparatus into machines now
into technological devices and maybe

4354
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:43,520
into technological devices and maybe
 

4355
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,189
into technological devices and maybe
that's the key technology that's going

4356
01:10:45,189 --> 01:10:45,199
that's the key technology that's going
 

4357
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,189
that's the key technology that's going
to allow us to see things like us and

4358
01:10:47,189 --> 01:10:47,199
to allow us to see things like us and
 

4359
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:48,390
to allow us to see things like us and
see the universe in a totally different

4360
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:48,400
see the universe in a totally different
 

4361
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,830
see the universe in a totally different
way but you kind of mentioned the great

4362
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:49,840
way but you kind of mentioned the great
 

4363
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,030
way but you kind of mentioned the great
filter do you think there's a way

4364
01:10:51,030 --> 01:10:51,040
filter do you think there's a way
 

4365
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,350
filter do you think there's a way
through technology to stop being able to

4366
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:53,360
through technology to stop being able to
 

4367
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,590
through technology to stop being able to
see stuff so can you take step backwards

4368
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:55,600
see stuff so can you take step backwards
 

4369
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,270
see stuff so can you take step backwards
i think so yeah did you imply that with

4370
01:10:57,270 --> 01:10:57,280
i think so yeah did you imply that with
 

4371
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,510
i think so yeah did you imply that with
the great so like well no i mean i think

4372
01:10:59,510 --> 01:10:59,520
the great so like well no i mean i think
 

4373
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,189
the great so like well no i mean i think
there's a great perceptual filter in the

4374
01:11:01,189 --> 01:11:01,199
there's a great perceptual filter in the
 

4375
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:02,310
there's a great perceptual filter in the
sense that

4376
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:02,320
sense that
 

4377
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:03,350
sense that
a

4378
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:03,360
a
 

4379
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,310
a
a

4380
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:04,320
a
 

4381
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,149
a
example of life evolving on a planet

4382
01:11:06,149 --> 01:11:06,159
example of life evolving on a planet
 

4383
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:08,709
example of life evolving on a planet
over billions of years has to acquire a

4384
01:11:08,709 --> 01:11:08,719
over billions of years has to acquire a
 

4385
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:09,750
over billions of years has to acquire a
certain amount of knowledge and

4386
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:09,760
certain amount of knowledge and
 

4387
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,709
certain amount of knowledge and
technology to actually recognize

4388
01:11:12,709 --> 01:11:12,719
technology to actually recognize
 

4389
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:15,110
technology to actually recognize
the phenomena that it is well that's the

4390
01:11:15,110 --> 01:11:15,120
the phenomena that it is well that's the
 

4391
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,390
the phenomena that it is well that's the
sense i have

4392
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:16,400
sense i have
 

4393
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,669
sense i have
is uh

4394
01:11:17,669 --> 01:11:17,679
is uh
 

4395
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:19,669
is uh
i mean you talk with physicist engineers

4396
01:11:19,669 --> 01:11:19,679
i mean you talk with physicist engineers
 

4397
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:21,830
i mean you talk with physicist engineers
in general that there's this kind of

4398
01:11:21,830 --> 01:11:21,840
in general that there's this kind of
 

4399
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,149
in general that there's this kind of
idea that we have

4400
01:11:24,149 --> 01:11:24,159
idea that we have
 

4401
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:26,630
idea that we have
most of the tools are ready just to hear

4402
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:26,640
most of the tools are ready just to hear
 

4403
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:27,830
most of the tools are ready just to hear
the signal

4404
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:27,840
the signal
 

4405
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,709
the signal
but to me it feels like we don't have

4406
01:11:30,709 --> 01:11:30,719
but to me it feels like we don't have
 

4407
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:32,950
but to me it feels like we don't have
any of the tools to see the segment yeah

4408
01:11:32,950 --> 01:11:32,960
any of the tools to see the segment yeah
 

4409
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,110
any of the tools to see the segment yeah
i agree that's that's the biggest like

4410
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:35,120
i agree that's that's the biggest like
 

4411
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,630
i agree that's that's the biggest like
to hear we don't have the tools to

4412
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:36,640
to hear we don't have the tools to
 

4413
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,510
to hear we don't have the tools to
really hear to see yeah

4414
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:39,520
really hear to see yeah
 

4415
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:41,270
really hear to see yeah
are everywhere we just don't have the

4416
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:41,280
are everywhere we just don't have the
 

4417
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:44,149
are everywhere we just don't have the
the um yeah i mean well

4418
01:11:44,149 --> 01:11:44,159
the um yeah i mean well
 

4419
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:45,910
the um yeah i mean well
oh that's i mean i got this in part

4420
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:45,920
oh that's i mean i got this in part
 

4421
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,110
oh that's i mean i got this in part
actually because you were like you know

4422
01:11:47,110 --> 01:11:47,120
actually because you were like you know
 

4423
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,390
actually because you were like you know
that last time i was here was like look

4424
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:48,400
that last time i was here was like look
 

4425
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,149
that last time i was here was like look
at the carpet you know could it like if

4426
01:11:50,149 --> 01:11:50,159
at the carpet you know could it like if
 

4427
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:51,430
at the carpet you know could it like if
you had an alien detector where the

4428
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:51,440
you had an alien detector where the
 

4429
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,110
you had an alien detector where the
carpet be aliens i mean i think we

4430
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:53,120
carpet be aliens i mean i think we
 

4431
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,390
carpet be aliens i mean i think we
really don't

4432
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:54,400
really don't
 

4433
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,870
really don't
i i would be both the aliens would

4434
01:11:56,870 --> 01:11:56,880
i i would be both the aliens would
 

4435
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,790
i i would be both the aliens would
nevertheless have a high assembly index

4436
01:11:58,790 --> 01:11:58,800
nevertheless have a high assembly index
 

4437
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,630
nevertheless have a high assembly index
or produce things like high assembly

4438
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:00,640
or produce things like high assembly
 

4439
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:01,830
or produce things like high assembly
yeah yeah yeah and those things have a

4440
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:01,840
yeah yeah yeah and those things have a
 

4441
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,910
yeah yeah yeah and those things have a
high assembly index

4442
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:03,920
high assembly index
 

4443
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,229
high assembly index
uh you have to have a detector that can

4444
01:12:06,229 --> 01:12:06,239
uh you have to have a detector that can
 

4445
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:08,550
uh you have to have a detector that can
recognize high assembly index in all its

4446
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:08,560
recognize high assembly index in all its
 

4447
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,030
recognize high assembly index in all its
forms yeah yes that's it that's it take

4448
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:11,040
forms yeah yes that's it that's it take
 

4449
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,149
forms yeah yes that's it that's it take
data

4450
01:12:12,149 --> 01:12:12,159
data
 

4451
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:14,470
data
construct assembly space yes patterns

4452
01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:14,480
construct assembly space yes patterns
 

4453
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:16,550
construct assembly space yes patterns
basically so one way to think about high

4454
01:12:16,550 --> 01:12:16,560
basically so one way to think about high
 

4455
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:19,030
basically so one way to think about high
assembly index is interesting patterns

4456
01:12:19,030 --> 01:12:19,040
assembly index is interesting patterns
 

4457
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,910
assembly index is interesting patterns
uh of basic ingredients i can give you

4458
01:12:21,910 --> 01:12:21,920
uh of basic ingredients i can give you
 

4459
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,229
uh of basic ingredients i can give you
an example because i mean molecules

4460
01:12:24,229 --> 01:12:24,239
an example because i mean molecules
 

4461
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:25,910
an example because i mean molecules
we've been talking about in objects but

4462
01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:25,920
we've been talking about in objects but
 

4463
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:28,390
we've been talking about in objects but
we're also trying to do it in um spatial

4464
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:28,400
we're also trying to do it in um spatial
 

4465
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,390
we're also trying to do it in um spatial
trajectories like imagine you're just

4466
01:12:30,390 --> 01:12:30,400
trajectories like imagine you're just
 

4467
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,550
trajectories like imagine you're just
um like i i always get bothered by the

4468
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:32,560
um like i i always get bothered by the
 

4469
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,709
um like i i always get bothered by the
fact that like when you look at birds

4470
01:12:34,709 --> 01:12:34,719
fact that like when you look at birds
 

4471
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:36,229
fact that like when you look at birds
flocking you can describe that with like

4472
01:12:36,229 --> 01:12:36,239
flocking you can describe that with like
 

4473
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:37,910
flocking you can describe that with like
a simple boys model or like you know

4474
01:12:37,910 --> 01:12:37,920
a simple boys model or like you know
 

4475
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,590
a simple boys model or like you know
people use spin glass to describe animal

4476
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:39,600
people use spin glass to describe animal
 

4477
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:40,630
people use spin glass to describe animal
behavior and those are like really

4478
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:40,640
behavior and those are like really
 

4479
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:42,870
behavior and those are like really
simple physics models yet you're looking

4480
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:42,880
simple physics models yet you're looking
 

4481
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,149
simple physics models yet you're looking
at a

4482
01:12:44,149 --> 01:12:44,159
at a
 

4483
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:46,709
at a
system that you know has agency and

4484
01:12:46,709 --> 01:12:46,719
system that you know has agency and
 

4485
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:48,870
system that you know has agency and
there's intelligence in those birds and

4486
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:48,880
there's intelligence in those birds and
 

4487
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:51,669
there's intelligence in those birds and
i and basically like you can't help but

4488
01:12:51,669 --> 01:12:51,679
i and basically like you can't help but
 

4489
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:53,350
i and basically like you can't help but
think there must be some statistical

a high assembly index and let's watch
 

4555
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,870
a high assembly index and let's watch
them create more and more memories

so like and mathematically you get to
 

4561
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,510
so like and mathematically you get to
observe what that looks like to build up

we are building a toolkit right now so i
 

4567
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,750
we are building a toolkit right now so i
think it's a really good idea but what

think it's a really good idea but what
 

4569
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,590
think it's a really good idea but what
we've got to do is i'm kind of still

01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:21,600
we've got to do is i'm kind of still
 

4571

we've got to do is i'm kind of still

when human being we take a lot of the
 

4583
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:33,430
when human being we take a lot of the

infrastructure for granted and and i
 

4585
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:34,950
infrastructure for granted and and i
think we have to strip that back a bit

4586
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:34,960
think we have to strip that back a bit
 

4587
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,470
think we have to strip that back a bit
for going forward but you're absolutely

4588
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:36,480
for going forward but you're absolutely
 

4589
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,149
for going forward but you're absolutely
right i would agree that

4590
01:14:38,149 --> 01:14:38,159
right i would agree that
 

4591
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:39,030
right i would agree that
i think

4592
01:14:39,030 --> 01:14:39,040
i think
 

4593
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,950
i think
the fact that we exist in the universe

4594
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:40,960
the fact that we exist in the universe
 

4595
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:43,510
the fact that we exist in the universe
this is like i can see there are lots of

4596
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:43,520
this is like i can see there are lots of
 

4597
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,110
this is like i can see there are lots of
people disagree with the statement but i

4598
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:45,120
people disagree with the statement but i
 

4599
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,430
people disagree with the statement but i
don't think i don't think sarah will but

4600
01:14:47,430 --> 01:14:47,440
don't think i don't think sarah will but
 

4601
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:50,229
don't think i don't think sarah will but
i don't know the fact that objects exist

4602
01:14:50,229 --> 01:14:50,239
i don't know the fact that objects exist
 

4603
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:51,990
i don't know the fact that objects exist
i don't think anyone on earth can just

01:14:51,990 --> 01:14:52,000
i don't think anyone on earth can just
 

4605
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,350
i don't think anyone on earth can just
will disagree

4606
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:53,360
will disagree
 

4607
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,669
will disagree
that objects can exist elsewhere right

4608
01:14:55,669 --> 01:14:55,679
that objects can exist elsewhere right
 

4609
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:57,430
that objects can exist elsewhere right
but they will disagree that life can

4610
01:14:57,430 --> 01:14:57,440
but they will disagree that life can
 

4611
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:59,669
but they will disagree that life can
exist elsewhere but what perhaps i'm

4612
01:14:59,669 --> 01:14:59,679
exist elsewhere but what perhaps i'm
 

4613
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:01,910
exist elsewhere but what perhaps i'm
trying to say is that the the

4614
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:01,920
trying to say is that the the
 

4615
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,550
trying to say is that the the
the acquisition the universe's ability

4616
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:04,560
the acquisition the universe's ability
 

4617
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:06,630
the acquisition the universe's ability
to acquire memory

4618
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:06,640
to acquire memory
 

4619
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:10,070
to acquire memory
is the very first step for building life

4620
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:10,080
is the very first step for building life
 

4621
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:10,950
is the very first step for building life
and

4622
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:10,960
and
 

4623
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,310
and
that must be that's so easy to happen so

4624
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:14,320
that must be that's so easy to happen so
 

4625
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,470
that must be that's so easy to happen so
therefore alien life is everywhere

4626
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:16,480
therefore alien life is everywhere
 

4627
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,709
therefore alien life is everywhere
because all alien life is

4628
01:15:18,709 --> 01:15:18,719
because all alien life is
 

4629
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:21,110
because all alien life is
is uh those memories being compressed

4630
01:15:21,110 --> 01:15:21,120
is uh those memories being compressed
 

4631
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,030
is uh those memories being compressed
and minimalized and the alien equivalent

4632
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:23,040
and minimalized and the alien equivalent
 

4633
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,709
and minimalized and the alien equivalent
of the cell working

4634
01:15:24,709 --> 01:15:24,719
of the cell working
 

4635
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:27,110
of the cell working
so i think that we will build new

4636
01:15:27,110 --> 01:15:27,120
so i think that we will build new
 

4637
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,270
so i think that we will build new
technologies to find aliens

4638
01:15:29,270 --> 01:15:29,280
technologies to find aliens
 

4639
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,110
technologies to find aliens
um but we do not we need to understand

4640
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:31,120
um but we do not we need to understand
 

4641
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,590
um but we do not we need to understand
what we are first and and how we go from

4642
01:15:33,590 --> 01:15:33,600
what we are first and and how we go from
 

4643
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:36,390
what we are first and and how we go from
physics to chemistry to biology

4644
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:36,400
physics to chemistry to biology
 

4645
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,709
physics to chemistry to biology
the most interesting thing as you're

the most interesting thing as you're
 

4647
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:40,790
the most interesting thing as you're
saying between these two organisms

4648
01:15:40,790 --> 01:15:40,800
saying between these two organisms
 

4649
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,070
saying between these two organisms
different assemblies is when you get

4650
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:42,080
different assemblies is when you get
 

4651
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,550
different assemblies is when you get
into biology biology gets more and more

4652
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:44,560
into biology biology gets more and more
 

4653
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,550
into biology biology gets more and more
weird more and more contingent where

4654
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:46,560
weird more and more contingent where
 

4655
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,630
weird more and more contingent where
physics is pro chemistry is less weird

4656
01:15:48,630 --> 01:15:48,640
physics is pro chemistry is less weird
 

4657
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:49,830
physics is pro chemistry is less weird
because the rules of chemistry are

4658
01:15:49,830 --> 01:15:49,840
because the rules of chemistry are
 

4659
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:50,870
because the rules of chemistry are
smaller than the rules of biology and

4660
01:15:50,870 --> 01:15:50,880
smaller than the rules of biology and
 

4661
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,630
smaller than the rules of biology and
then going away to physics where you

4662
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:52,640
then going away to physics where you
 

4663
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:56,070
then going away to physics where you
have a very

4664
01:15:56,070 --> 01:15:56,080

 

4665
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:58,470

nicely tangible number of ways of

01:15:58,470 --> 01:15:58,480
nicely tangible number of ways of
 

4667
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,149
nicely tangible number of ways of
arranging things

4668
01:16:00,149 --> 01:16:00,159
arranging things
 

4669
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:01,590
arranging things
and i think

4670
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:01,600
and i think
 

4671
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,630
and i think
assembly theory just helps you

4672
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:02,640
assembly theory just helps you
 

4673
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,630
assembly theory just helps you
appreciate that and so once we get there

4674
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:04,640
appreciate that and so once we get there
 

4675
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,149
appreciate that and so once we get there
my dream is that we are just going to be

4676
01:16:06,149 --> 01:16:06,159
my dream is that we are just going to be
 

4677
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:08,149
my dream is that we are just going to be
able to suddenly are

4678
01:16:08,149 --> 01:16:08,159
able to suddenly are
 

4679
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:09,750
able to suddenly are
i mean i'm i mean i'm maybe just being

4680
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:09,760
i mean i'm i mean i'm maybe just being
 

4681
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,110
i mean i'm i mean i'm maybe just being
really arrogant here i don't mean to be

4682
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:11,120
really arrogant here i don't mean to be
 

4683
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,709
really arrogant here i don't mean to be
arrogant it's just again i've just got

4684
01:16:12,709 --> 01:16:12,719
arrogant it's just again i've just got
 

4685
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:14,070
arrogant it's just again i've just got
this hammer called assembly and

4686
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:14,080
this hammer called assembly and
 

4687
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:16,630
this hammer called assembly and
everything's nail but i think that once

4688
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:16,640
everything's nail but i think that once
 

4689
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:17,910
everything's nail but i think that once
we crack it we'll be able to use

4690
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:17,920
we crack it we'll be able to use
 

4691
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,310
we crack it we'll be able to use

01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:23,760
do you have sarah do you have

4699
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:29,430

01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:29,440
aliens that are out there so and
 

4701
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,270
aliens that are out there so and
actually yeah well and what they look

4702
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:31,280
actually yeah well and what they look
 

4703
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,550
actually yeah well and what they look
like so any of the things we've been

4704
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:32,560
like so any of the things we've been
 

4705
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:36,229
like so any of the things we've been
talking about is there um nuanced

4706
01:16:36,229 --> 01:16:36,239
talking about is there um nuanced
 

4707
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:39,350
talking about is there um nuanced
oh it's always nice to discover

4708
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:39,360
oh it's always nice to discover
 

4709
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:40,790
oh it's always nice to discover
uh wisdom

4710
01:16:40,790 --> 01:16:40,800
uh wisdom
 

4711
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,229

through nuance
disagreement yeah i i don't i don't

4714
01:16:45,110 --> 01:16:45,120
disagreement yeah i i don't i don't
 

4715
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:47,590
disagreement yeah i i don't i don't
wholly disagree but i think um but i do

4716
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:47,600
wholly disagree but i think um but i do
 

4717
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,830
wholly disagree but i think um but i do
think i disagree it's kind of there's

4718
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:49,840
think i disagree it's kind of there's
 

4719
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,630
think i disagree it's kind of there's
nuance there um but but you can disagree

4720
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:52,640
nuance there um but but you can disagree
 

4721
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,550
nuance there um but but you can disagree
no it's fine um

4722
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:54,560
no it's fine um
 

4723
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,470
no it's fine um
it is nuanced right so you made the

4724
01:16:56,470 --> 01:16:56,480
it is nuanced right so you made the
 

4725
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,950
it is nuanced right so you made the
point earlier that you think um

4726
01:16:58,950 --> 01:16:58,960
point earlier that you think um
 

4727
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,709
point earlier that you think um
you know once we discover what alien

4728
01:17:00,709 --> 01:17:00,719
you know once we discover what alien
 

4729
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:02,709
you know once we discover what alien
like what life is we'll see alien life

4730
01:17:02,709 --> 01:17:02,719
like what life is we'll see alien life
 

4731
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:03,750
like what life is we'll see alien life
everywhere

4732
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:03,760
everywhere
 

4733
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,990
everywhere
um and i think i agree on some levels in

4734
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:06,000
um and i think i agree on some levels in
 

4735
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,189
um and i think i agree on some levels in
the sense that i think the physics that

4736
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:07,199
the sense that i think the physics that
 

4737
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:09,830
the sense that i think the physics that
governs us is universal but i i don't

4738
01:17:09,830 --> 01:17:09,840
governs us is universal but i i don't
 

4739
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,590
governs us is universal but i i don't
know how far i would go to say to say

4740
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:11,600
know how far i would go to say to say
 

4741
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,950
know how far i would go to say to say
that we're a likely phenomenon because

4742
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:12,960
that we're a likely phenomenon because
 

4743
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,390
that we're a likely phenomenon because
we don't understand

4744
01:17:14,390 --> 01:17:14,400
we don't understand
 

4745
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,790
we don't understand
all of the features of the transition at

4746
01:17:16,790 --> 01:17:16,800
all of the features of the transition at
 

4747
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,630
all of the features of the transition at
the original life which which we would

4748
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:18,640
the original life which which we would
 

4749
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,870
the original life which which we would
just say in assembly as you go from uh

4750
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:20,880
just say in assembly as you go from uh
 

4751
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:23,430
just say in assembly as you go from uh
the no memory physics to

4752
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:23,440
the no memory physics to
 

4753
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:24,310
the no memory physics to
uh

4754
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:24,320
uh
 

4755
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,990
uh
there's like a critical transition

4756
01:17:25,990 --> 01:17:26,000
there's like a critical transition
 

4757
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,270
there's like a critical transition
around the assembly index where

4758
01:17:27,270 --> 01:17:27,280
around the assembly index where
 

4759
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:28,709
around the assembly index where
assembliness starts to increase and

4760
01:17:28,709 --> 01:17:28,719
assembliness starts to increase and
 

4761
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:29,669
assembliness starts to increase and
that's what we call the evolution of the

4762
01:17:29,669 --> 01:17:29,679
that's what we call the evolution of the
 

4763
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:31,030
that's what we call the evolution of the
biosphere and complexification of the

4764
01:17:31,030 --> 01:17:31,040
biosphere and complexification of the
 

4765
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:32,790
biosphere and complexification of the
biosphere

4766
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:32,800
biosphere
 

4767
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:33,990
biosphere
so there's a principle of increasing

4768
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:34,000
so there's a principle of increasing
 

4769
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,430
so there's a principle of increasing
assembliness or that goes back to what i

4770
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:35,440
assembliness or that goes back to what i
 

4771
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:36,470
assembliness or that goes back to what i
was saying at the very beginning about

4772
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:36,480
was saying at the very beginning about
 

4773
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,630
was saying at the very beginning about
the physics of the possible that the

4774
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:38,640
the physics of the possible that the
 

4775
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,709
the physics of the possible that the
universe basically gets in this mode of

4776
01:17:40,709 --> 01:17:40,719
universe basically gets in this mode of
 

4777
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:41,830
universe basically gets in this mode of
trying to make

4778
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:41,840
trying to make
 

4779
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:45,990
trying to make
as much possibilities as possible um now

4780
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:46,000
as much possibilities as possible um now
 

4781
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,870
as much possibilities as possible um now
how often that transition happens

4782
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:48,880
how often that transition happens
 

4783
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:50,229
how often that transition happens
that you get the kind of cascading

4784
01:17:50,229 --> 01:17:50,239
that you get the kind of cascading
 

4785
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:51,750
that you get the kind of cascading
effect that we get in our biosphere i

4786
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:51,760
effect that we get in our biosphere i
 

4787
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,590
effect that we get in our biosphere i
think we don't know if we did we would

4788
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:53,600
think we don't know if we did we would
 

4789
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:54,709
think we don't know if we did we would
know the likelihood of life in the

4790
01:17:54,709 --> 01:17:54,719
know the likelihood of life in the
 

4791
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:56,310
know the likelihood of life in the
universe and a lot of people want to say

4792
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:56,320
universe and a lot of people want to say
 

4793
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,669
universe and a lot of people want to say
life is common but i don't think that we

4794
01:17:57,669 --> 01:17:57,679
life is common but i don't think that we
 

4795
01:17:57,679 --> 01:17:58,630
life is common but i don't think that we
can say that yet so we have the

4796
01:17:58,630 --> 01:17:58,640
can say that yet so we have the
 

4797
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,390
can say that yet so we have the
empirical data which i think you would

4798
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:00,400
empirical data which i think you would
 

4799
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,149
empirical data which i think you would
agree with but then there's this other

4800
01:18:02,149 --> 01:18:02,159
agree with but then there's this other
 

4801
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:03,430
agree with but then there's this other
kind of

4802
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:03,440
kind of
 

4803
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,950
kind of
thought experiment i have which i i

4804
01:18:04,950 --> 01:18:04,960
thought experiment i have which i i
 

4805
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:08,070
thought experiment i have which i i
don't like um but i did have it um which

4806
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:08,080
don't like um but i did have it um which
 

4807
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,510
don't like um but i did have it um which
is um

4808
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:09,520
is um
 

4809
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,669
is um
you know if life emerges on one planet

4810
01:18:11,669 --> 01:18:11,679
you know if life emerges on one planet
 

4811
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:13,030
you know if life emerges on one planet
and you get this real high density of

4812
01:18:13,030 --> 01:18:13,040
and you get this real high density of
 

4813
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,709
and you get this real high density of
things that can exist on that planet is

4814
01:18:14,709 --> 01:18:14,719
things that can exist on that planet is
 

4815
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:17,189
things that can exist on that planet is
it sort of dominating the density of

4816
01:18:17,189 --> 01:18:17,199
it sort of dominating the density of
 

4817
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:18,709
it sort of dominating the density of
creation that the universe can actually

4818
01:18:18,709 --> 01:18:18,719
creation that the universe can actually
 

4819
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:19,830
creation that the universe can actually
generate so like if you're thinking

4820
01:18:19,830 --> 01:18:19,840
generate so like if you're thinking
 

4821
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,590
generate so like if you're thinking
about counting entropy right like the

4822
01:18:21,590 --> 01:18:21,600
about counting entropy right like the
 

4823
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,189
about counting entropy right like the
universe has a certain amount of stuff

4824
01:18:23,189 --> 01:18:23,199
universe has a certain amount of stuff
 

4825
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:25,350
universe has a certain amount of stuff
in it and then you know

4826
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:25,360
in it and then you know
 

4827
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:27,350
in it and then you know
assembly is kind of like an entropic

4828
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:27,360
assembly is kind of like an entropic
 

4829
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:29,830
assembly is kind of like an entropic
principle it's not entropy but the idea

4830
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:29,840
principle it's not entropy but the idea
 

4831
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,870
principle it's not entropy but the idea
is that now transformations among stuff

4832
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:32,880
is that now transformations among stuff
 

4833
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:35,430
is that now transformations among stuff
or the actual physical histories of

4834
01:18:35,430 --> 01:18:35,440
or the actual physical histories of
 

4835
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,110
or the actual physical histories of
things now become things that you have

4836
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:37,120
things now become things that you have
 

4837
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,790
things now become things that you have
to count as far as

4838
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:38,800
to count as far as
 

4839
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,229
to count as far as
saying that these things exist and we're

4840
01:18:40,229 --> 01:18:40,239
saying that these things exist and we're
 

4841
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:41,590
saying that these things exist and we're
increasing the number of things that

4842
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:41,600
increasing the number of things that
 

4843
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:42,709
increasing the number of things that
exist

4844
01:18:42,709 --> 01:18:42,719
exist
 

4845
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:44,550
exist
and uh and if you think about that

4846
01:18:44,550 --> 01:18:44,560
and uh and if you think about that
 

4847
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,709
and uh and if you think about that
cosmologically maybe earth is sucking up

4848
01:18:46,709 --> 01:18:46,719
cosmologically maybe earth is sucking up
 

4849
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:47,910
cosmologically maybe earth is sucking up
all the life potential of the whole

4850
01:18:47,910 --> 01:18:47,920
all the life potential of the whole
 

4851
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:49,270
all the life potential of the whole
universe i don't know

4852
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:49,280
universe i don't know
 

4853
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,110
universe i don't know
but how's that can you explain that a

4854
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:51,120
but how's that can you explain that a
 

4855
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,430
but how's that can you explain that a
little bit why can any one geographical

4856
01:18:53,430 --> 01:18:53,440
little bit why can any one geographical
 

4857
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:54,470
little bit why can any one geographical
region

4858
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:54,480
region
 

4859
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,709
region
suck up the creative capacity of the

4860
01:18:56,709 --> 01:18:56,719
suck up the creative capacity of the
 

4861
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:58,630
suck up the creative capacity of the
universe um just like

4862
01:18:58,630 --> 01:18:58,640
universe um just like
 

4863
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:00,229
universe um just like
i i know it's a ridiculous thought i

4864
01:19:00,229 --> 01:19:00,239
i i know it's a ridiculous thought i
 

4865
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:01,510
i i know it's a ridiculous thought i
don't i don't actually agree with it but

4866
01:19:01,510 --> 01:19:01,520
don't i don't actually agree with it but
 

4867
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,030
don't i don't actually agree with it but
it was just the thought i love that you

4868
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:03,040
it was just the thought i love that you
 

4869
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,630
it was just the thought i love that you
can have thoughts

4870
01:19:04,630 --> 01:19:04,640
can have thoughts
 

4871
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,870
can have thoughts
that you don't like and don't agree with

4872
01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:06,880
that you don't like and don't agree with
 

4873
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,390
that you don't like and don't agree with
but you have to think through them

4874
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:08,400
but you have to think through them
 

4875
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,470
but you have to think through them
anyway yeah

4876
01:19:10,470 --> 01:19:10,480
anyway yeah
 

4877
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,709
anyway yeah
the human mind is fascinating yeah i i

4878
01:19:12,709 --> 01:19:12,719
the human mind is fascinating yeah i i
 

4879
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:14,470
the human mind is fascinating yeah i i
think these sort of um

4880
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:14,480
think these sort of um
 

4881
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:15,910
think these sort of um
like counter factual thought experiments

4882
01:19:15,910 --> 01:19:15,920
like counter factual thought experiments
 

4883
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:16,790
like counter factual thought experiments
are really good when you're trying to

4884
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:16,800
are really good when you're trying to
 

4885
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:17,990
are really good when you're trying to
build new theories because you have to

4886
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:18,000
build new theories because you have to
 

4887
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,149
build new theories because you have to
think through all the consequences and

4888
01:19:20,149 --> 01:19:20,159
think through all the consequences and
 

4889
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:22,149
think through all the consequences and
there are people that want to try to

4890
01:19:22,149 --> 01:19:22,159
there are people that want to try to
 

4891
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:24,470
there are people that want to try to
account for say the degrees of freedom

4892
01:19:24,470 --> 01:19:24,480
account for say the degrees of freedom
 

4893
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:26,310
account for say the degrees of freedom
on our planet in cosmological

4894
01:19:26,310 --> 01:19:26,320
on our planet in cosmological
 

4895
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,390
on our planet in cosmological
inventories of you know talking about

4896
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:28,400
inventories of you know talking about
 

4897
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,550
inventories of you know talking about
the entropy of the universe and you know

4898
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:30,560
the entropy of the universe and you know
 

4899
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:31,430
the entropy of the universe and you know
and when we're thinking about like

4900
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:31,440
and when we're thinking about like
 

4901
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:32,950
and when we're thinking about like
cosmological arrow of time and things

4902
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:32,960
cosmological arrow of time and things
 

4903
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,310
cosmological arrow of time and things
like that now i think those are pretty

4904
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:34,320
like that now i think those are pretty
 

4905
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,070
like that now i think those are pretty
superficial proposals as they stand now

4906
01:19:36,070 --> 01:19:36,080
superficial proposals as they stand now
 

4907
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,350
superficial proposals as they stand now
but assembly would give you a way of

4908
01:19:37,350 --> 01:19:37,360
but assembly would give you a way of
 

4909
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,350
but assembly would give you a way of
counting it and then the question is if

4910
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:39,360
counting it and then the question is if
 

4911
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:41,830
counting it and then the question is if
there's a certain maximal capacity of

4912
01:19:41,830 --> 01:19:41,840
there's a certain maximal capacity of
 

4913
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,990
there's a certain maximal capacity of
the universe's speed of generating stuff

4914
01:19:43,990 --> 01:19:44,000
the universe's speed of generating stuff
 

4915
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,910
the universe's speed of generating stuff
which lee always has this argument that

4916
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:45,920
which lee always has this argument that
 

4917
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,990
which lee always has this argument that
assembly is about time the universe is

4918
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:48,000
assembly is about time the universe is
 

4919
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,669
assembly is about time the universe is
generating more states really what it's

4920
01:19:49,669 --> 01:19:49,679
generating more states really what it's
 

4921
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:51,110
generating more states really what it's
generating is more

4922
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:51,120
generating is more
 

4923
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,830
generating is more
assembly possibilities and then dark

4924
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:53,840
assembly possibilities and then dark
 

4925
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,750
assembly possibilities and then dark
energy might be one manifestation of

4926
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:55,760
energy might be one manifestation of
 

4927
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,430
energy might be one manifestation of
that that the universe is accelerating

4928
01:19:57,430 --> 01:19:57,440
that that the universe is accelerating
 

4929
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:58,870
that that the universe is accelerating
its expansion because that makes more

4930
01:19:58,870 --> 01:19:58,880
its expansion because that makes more
 

4931
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,709
its expansion because that makes more
physical space and what's happening on

4932
01:20:00,709 --> 01:20:00,719
physical space and what's happening on
 

4933
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:02,550
physical space and what's happening on
our planet is it's accelerating in the

4934
01:20:02,550 --> 01:20:02,560
our planet is it's accelerating in the
 

4935
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:05,030
our planet is it's accelerating in the
expansion of possible things that exist

4936
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:05,040
expansion of possible things that exist
 

4937
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,149
expansion of possible things that exist
and maybe the universe just has a

4938
01:20:06,149 --> 01:20:06,159
and maybe the universe just has a
 

4939
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:07,990
and maybe the universe just has a
maximal rate of what it can do to

4940
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:08,000
maximal rate of what it can do to
 

4941
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,149
maximal rate of what it can do to
generate things and then if if there is

4942
01:20:10,149 --> 01:20:10,159
generate things and then if if there is
 

4943
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:11,669
generate things and then if if there is
a maximal rate maybe only a certain

4944
01:20:11,669 --> 01:20:11,679
a maximal rate maybe only a certain
 

4945
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:13,430
a maximal rate maybe only a certain
number of planets can actually do that

4946
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:13,440
number of planets can actually do that
 

4947
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,669
number of planets can actually do that
or there's a trade-off about the pace of

4948
01:20:15,669 --> 01:20:15,679
or there's a trade-off about the pace of
 

4949
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:17,830
or there's a trade-off about the pace of
growth on certain planets versus others

4950
01:20:17,830 --> 01:20:17,840
growth on certain planets versus others
 

4951
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,270
growth on certain planets versus others
i have a million questions there would

4952
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:19,280
i have a million questions there would
 

4953
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:21,030
i have a million questions there would
you have you have thoughts and just a

4954
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:21,040
you have you have thoughts and just a
 

4955
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:22,149
you have you have thoughts and just a
quick yeah i'll just say something very

4956
01:20:22,149 --> 01:20:22,159
quick yeah i'll just say something very
 

4957
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:22,950
quick yeah i'll just say something very
quickly

4958
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:22,960
quickly
 

4959
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,470
quickly
no it's good i think i get it i think i

4960
01:20:24,470 --> 01:20:24,480
no it's good i think i get it i think i
 

4961
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:27,430
no it's good i think i get it i think i
get it so um all i want to say is

4962
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:27,440
get it so um all i want to say is
 

4963
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:30,830
get it so um all i want to say is
when i mean aliens are everywhere i mean

4964
01:20:30,830 --> 01:20:30,840
when i mean aliens are everywhere i mean
 

4965
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:35,590
when i mean aliens are everywhere i mean
memories are the prerequisite for

4966
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:35,600
memories are the prerequisite for
 

4967
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,189
memories are the prerequisite for
aliens via selection and then

4968
01:20:37,189 --> 01:20:37,199
aliens via selection and then
 

4969
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:39,110
aliens via selection and then
concentration of selection when

4970
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:39,120
concentration of selection when
 

4971
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,629
concentration of selection when
selection becomes autonomous so what i

4972
01:20:40,629 --> 01:20:40,639
selection becomes autonomous so what i
 

4973
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:42,709
selection becomes autonomous so what i
would love to do is to build say a

4974
01:20:42,709 --> 01:20:42,719
would love to do is to build say a
 

4975
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:45,510
would love to do is to build say a
magical telescope that was a memory a

4976
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:45,520
magical telescope that was a memory a
 

4977
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,030
magical telescope that was a memory a
magical one yeah

4978
01:20:47,030 --> 01:20:47,040
magical one yeah
 

4979
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,870
magical one yeah
or a real one there would be a memory

4980
01:20:48,870 --> 01:20:48,880
or a real one there would be a memory
 

4981
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,910
or a real one there would be a memory
detector to see selection so you could

4982
01:20:51,910 --> 01:20:51,920
detector to see selection so you could
 

4983
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,510
detector to see selection so you could
you could get to exoplanets and say that

4984
01:20:53,510 --> 01:20:53,520
you could get to exoplanets and say that
 

4985
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:54,790
you could get to exoplanets and say that
exoplanet looks like there's lots of

4986
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:54,800
exoplanet looks like there's lots of
 

4987
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,790
exoplanet looks like there's lots of
selection going on there maybe there's

4988
01:20:56,790 --> 01:20:56,800
selection going on there maybe there's
 

4989
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,070
selection going on there maybe there's
evolution and maybe there's going to be

4990
01:20:58,070 --> 01:20:58,080
evolution and maybe there's going to be
 

4991
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:59,830
evolution and maybe there's going to be
life so what i'm trying to say is narrow

4992
01:20:59,830 --> 01:20:59,840
life so what i'm trying to say is narrow
 

4993
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:01,669
life so what i'm trying to say is narrow
down the regions of space where you say

4994
01:21:01,669 --> 01:21:01,679
down the regions of space where you say
 

4995
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:03,990
down the regions of space where you say
there's definitely evidence of memory as

4996
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:04,000
there's definitely evidence of memory as
 

4997
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,830
there's definitely evidence of memory as
high assembly there or not the high

4998
01:21:05,830 --> 01:21:05,840
high assembly there or not the high
 

4999
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,430
high assembly there or not the high
assembly because that would be life but

5000
01:21:07,430 --> 01:21:07,440
assembly because that would be life but
 

5001
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:10,070
assembly because that would be life but
if select this where where it's capable

5002
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:10,080
if select this where where it's capable
 

5003
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,149
if select this where where it's capable
of happening and then we've then that

5004
01:21:12,149 --> 01:21:12,159
of happening and then we've then that
 

5005
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:13,750
of happening and then we've then that
would also help us frame the search for

5006
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:13,760
would also help us frame the search for
 

5007
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:16,229
would also help us frame the search for
aliens i don't know how likely it is to

5008
01:21:16,229 --> 01:21:16,239
aliens i don't know how likely it is to
 

5009
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:18,070
aliens i don't know how likely it is to
make the transition to cells and all the

5010
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:18,080
make the transition to cells and all the
 

5011
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,390
make the transition to cells and all the
other things i think you're right but i

5012
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:20,400
other things i think you're right but i
 

5013
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:21,590
other things i think you're right but i
think that is

5014
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:21,600
think that is
 

5015
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,430
think that is
yeah we just need to get more data well

5016
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:23,440
yeah we just need to get more data well
 

5017
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:24,709
yeah we just need to get more data well
i didn't like the thought experiment

5018
01:21:24,709 --> 01:21:24,719
i didn't like the thought experiment
 

5019
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:26,149
i didn't like the thought experiment
because i don't like the idea that if

5020
01:21:26,149 --> 01:21:26,159
because i don't like the idea that if
 

5021
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:27,910
because i don't like the idea that if
the universe has a maximal limit on the

5022
01:21:27,910 --> 01:21:27,920
the universe has a maximal limit on the
 

5023
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:29,590
the universe has a maximal limit on the
amount it can generate per unit time

5024
01:21:29,590 --> 01:21:29,600
amount it can generate per unit time
 

5025
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,870
amount it can generate per unit time
that our existence is actually

5026
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:30,880
that our existence is actually
 

5027
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,390
that our existence is actually
precluding the existence of other things

5028
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:32,400
precluding the existence of other things
 

5029
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:33,270
precluding the existence of other things
i'll just say one thing but i think

5030
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:33,280
i'll just say one thing but i think
 

5031
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:34,390
i'll just say one thing but i think
that's probably true anyway because the

5032
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:34,400
that's probably true anyway because the
 

5033
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,310
that's probably true anyway because the
resource limitations so i don't like

5034
01:21:36,310 --> 01:21:36,320
resource limitations so i don't like
 

5035
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:37,830
resource limitations so i don't like
your thought experiment because i think

5036
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:37,840
your thought experiment because i think
 

5037
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:40,149
your thought experiment because i think
it's wrong because well no no no i do

5038
01:21:40,149 --> 01:21:40,159
it's wrong because well no no no i do
 

5039
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:41,750
it's wrong because well no no no i do
like thor express so what you're trying

5040
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:41,760
like thor express so what you're trying
 

5041
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:43,030
like thor express so what you're trying
to say is like there is a chain of

5042
01:21:43,030 --> 01:21:43,040
to say is like there is a chain of
 

5043
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:45,990
to say is like there is a chain of
events that goes back that's manifestly

5044
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:46,000
events that goes back that's manifestly
 

5045
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,070
events that goes back that's manifestly
collimated with life on earth

5046
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:48,080
collimated with life on earth
 

5047
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:49,430
collimated with life on earth
and you're not saying that life isn't

5048
01:21:49,430 --> 01:21:49,440
and you're not saying that life isn't
 

5049
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,189
and you're not saying that life isn't
possible elsewhere say that there has

5050
01:21:51,189 --> 01:21:51,199
possible elsewhere say that there has
 

5051
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:52,790
possible elsewhere say that there has
been these number of things contingent

5052
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:52,800
been these number of things contingent
 

5053
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,229
been these number of things contingent
things that have happened that have

5054
01:21:54,229 --> 01:21:54,239
things that have happened that have
 

5055
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:56,629
things that have happened that have
allowed life to merge here um that

5056
01:21:56,629 --> 01:21:56,639
allowed life to merge here um that
 

5057
01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:57,750
allowed life to merge here um that
doesn't mean that life can't emerge

5058
01:21:57,750 --> 01:21:57,760
doesn't mean that life can't emerge
 

5059
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,110
doesn't mean that life can't emerge
elsewhere but you're saying that these

5060
01:21:59,110 --> 01:21:59,120
elsewhere but you're saying that these
 

5061
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,189
elsewhere but you're saying that these
the intersection of events may have may

5062
01:22:01,189 --> 01:22:01,199
the intersection of events may have may
 

5063
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:03,430
the intersection of events may have may
be concentrated here right

5064
01:22:03,430 --> 01:22:03,440
be concentrated here right
 

5065
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:05,830
be concentrated here right
um and i think that's not exact not

5066
01:22:05,830 --> 01:22:05,840
um and i think that's not exact not
 

5067
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,830
um and i think that's not exact not
exactly it's more like um

5068
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:07,840
exactly it's more like um
 

5069
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,790
exactly it's more like um
like uh you know if you you look at say

5070
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:10,800
like uh you know if you you look at say
 

5071
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,310
like uh you know if you you look at say
the causal graphs are fundamental maybe

5072
01:22:12,310 --> 01:22:12,320
the causal graphs are fundamental maybe
 

5073
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,470
the causal graphs are fundamental maybe
space is an emergent property which is

5074
01:22:14,470 --> 01:22:14,480
space is an emergent property which is
 

5075
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:15,990
space is an emergent property which is
consistent with some proposals in

5076
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:16,000
consistent with some proposals in
 

5077
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,270
consistent with some proposals in
quantum gravity but also how we talk

5078
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:17,280
quantum gravity but also how we talk
 

5079
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:18,950
quantum gravity but also how we talk
about things in assembly theory

5080
01:22:18,950 --> 01:22:18,960
about things in assembly theory
 

5081
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,110
about things in assembly theory
then the universe is causal graphs

5082
01:22:21,110 --> 01:22:21,120
then the universe is causal graphs
 

5083
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:22,229
then the universe is causal graphs
generating

5084
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:22,239
generating
 

5085
01:22:22,239 --> 01:22:24,070
generating
more structure in clausal graphs right

5086
01:22:24,070 --> 01:22:24,080
more structure in clausal graphs right
 

5087
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,070
more structure in clausal graphs right
so this is how the universe is unfolding

5088
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:26,080
so this is how the universe is unfolding
 

5089
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,669
so this is how the universe is unfolding
and maybe there's a

5090
01:22:27,669 --> 01:22:27,679
and maybe there's a
 

5091
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:30,390
and maybe there's a
cap on the rate of generation like the

5092
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:30,400
cap on the rate of generation like the
 

5093
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:31,910
cap on the rate of generation like the
there's only so much stuff that gets

5094
01:22:31,910 --> 01:22:31,920
there's only so much stuff that gets
 

5095
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,030
there's only so much stuff that gets
made per

5096
01:22:33,030 --> 01:22:33,040
made per
 

5097
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:35,030
made per
update of the universe and then if

5098
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:35,040
update of the universe and then if
 

5099
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,470
update of the universe and then if
there's a lot of stuff being made in a

5100
01:22:36,470 --> 01:22:36,480
there's a lot of stuff being made in a
 

5101
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,709
there's a lot of stuff being made in a
particular region that happens to look

5102
01:22:38,709 --> 01:22:38,719
particular region that happens to look
 

5103
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:41,350
particular region that happens to look
the same locally spatially that's an

5104
01:22:41,350 --> 01:22:41,360
the same locally spatially that's an
 

5105
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:42,709
the same locally spatially that's an
after effect

5106
01:22:42,709 --> 01:22:42,719
after effect
 

5107
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:44,229
after effect
of the fact that the whole causal graph

5108
01:22:44,229 --> 01:22:44,239
of the fact that the whole causal graph
 

5109
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:46,870
of the fact that the whole causal graph
is updating like it's it it

5110
01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:46,880
is updating like it's it it
 

5111
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:49,270
is updating like it's it it
uh yeah i don't i don't know that i

5112
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:49,280
uh yeah i don't i don't know that i
 

5113
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,030
uh yeah i don't i don't know that i
think that that doesn't work i don't

5114
01:22:51,030 --> 01:22:51,040
think that that doesn't work i don't
 

5115
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:52,390
think that that doesn't work i don't
think it works either but i don't have a

5116
01:22:52,390 --> 01:22:52,400
think it works either but i don't have a
 

5117
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:53,990
think it works either but i don't have a
good argument in my mind about but i do

5118
01:22:53,990 --> 01:22:54,000
good argument in my mind about but i do
 

5119
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,430
good argument in my mind about but i do
like the idea of the capacity the

5120
01:22:55,430 --> 01:22:55,440
like the idea of the capacity the
 

5121
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:56,470
like the idea of the capacity the
universe because you've got the number

5122
01:22:56,470 --> 01:22:56,480
universe because you've got the number
 

5123
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,790
universe because you've got the number
of states yeah we can come back to it

5124
01:22:58,790 --> 01:22:58,800
of states yeah we can come back to it
 

5125
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:01,350
of states yeah we can come back to it
well let me ask real quick like why does

5126
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:01,360
well let me ask real quick like why does
 

5127
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:04,470
well let me ask real quick like why does
uh different like local pockets

5128
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:04,480
uh different like local pockets
 

5129
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:07,430
uh different like local pockets
of the universe start remembering stuff

5130
01:23:07,430 --> 01:23:07,440
of the universe start remembering stuff
 

5131
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:11,110
of the universe start remembering stuff
how does memory uh emerge exactly so

5132
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:11,120
how does memory uh emerge exactly so
 

5133
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,629
how does memory uh emerge exactly so
at the origin

5134
01:23:12,629 --> 01:23:12,639
at the origin
 

5135
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:13,990
at the origin
of the universe

5136
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:14,000
of the universe
 

5137
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,310
of the universe
i was very forgetful that's when the

5138
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:16,320
i was very forgetful that's when the
 

5139
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,870
i was very forgetful that's when the
physicists were happiest as low memory

5140
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:18,880
physicists were happiest as low memory
 

5141
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,870
physicists were happiest as low memory
objects um

5142
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:20,880
objects um
 

5143
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:23,750
objects um
which is like ultra low memory objects

5144
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:23,760
which is like ultra low memory objects
 

5145
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,390
which is like ultra low memory objects
which is what the definition of stuff

5146
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:26,400
which is what the definition of stuff
 

5147
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:29,430
which is what the definition of stuff
okay so how does memory emerge how does

5148
01:23:29,430 --> 01:23:29,440
okay so how does memory emerge how does
 

5149
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:30,390
okay so how does memory emerge how does
which is

5150
01:23:30,390 --> 01:23:30,400
which is
 

5151
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:32,550
which is
this how does this the temporal

5152
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:32,560
this how does this the temporal
 

5153
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:34,149
this how does this the temporal
stickiness

5154
01:23:34,149 --> 01:23:34,159
stickiness
 

5155
01:23:34,159 --> 01:23:36,470
stickiness
so objects emerge

5156
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:36,480
so objects emerge
 

5157
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:37,350
so objects emerge
um

5158
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:37,360
um
 

5159
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:39,910
um
i i i i'm going to take a very

5160
01:23:39,910 --> 01:23:39,920
i i i i'm going to take a very
 

5161
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:42,229
i i i i'm going to take a very
chemocentric point of view because i

5162
01:23:42,229 --> 01:23:42,239
chemocentric point of view because i
 

5163
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:43,910
chemocentric point of view because i
can't imagine any other way of doing it

5164
01:23:43,910 --> 01:23:43,920
can't imagine any other way of doing it
 

5165
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:47,030
can't imagine any other way of doing it
you you could think of other ways maybe

5166
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:47,040
you you could think of other ways maybe
 

5167
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:49,350
you you could think of other ways maybe
um but i would say

5168
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:49,360
um but i would say
 

5169
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,990
um but i would say
heterogeneity in matter

5170
01:23:51,990 --> 01:23:52,000
heterogeneity in matter
 

5171
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,990
heterogeneity in matter
is where the memory so you must have

5172
01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:54,000
is where the memory so you must have
 

5173
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:54,870
is where the memory so you must have
enough

5174
01:23:54,870 --> 01:23:54,880
enough
 

5175
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:57,030
enough
different ways of rearranging matter for

5176
01:23:57,030 --> 01:23:57,040
different ways of rearranging matter for
 

5177
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,030
different ways of rearranging matter for
there to be a memory so what that means

5178
01:23:59,030 --> 01:23:59,040
there to be a memory so what that means
 

5179
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,550
there to be a memory so what that means
is if you've got particles colliding in

5180
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:00,560
is if you've got particles colliding in
 

5181
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:04,149
is if you've got particles colliding in
a box let's just take a um some in or

5182
01:24:04,149 --> 01:24:04,159
a box let's just take a um some in or
 

5183
01:24:04,159 --> 01:24:06,790
a box let's just take a um some in or
some elements in a box

5184
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:06,800
some elements in a box
 

5185
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,550
some elements in a box
those elements can combine in a

5186
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:08,560
those elements can combine in a
 

5187
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,550
those elements can combine in a
combinatorial set of ways so there's a

5188
01:24:10,550 --> 01:24:10,560
combinatorial set of ways so there's a
 

5189
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,550
combinatorial set of ways so there's a
commentary explosion of the number of

5190
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:12,560
commentary explosion of the number of
 

5191
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:15,189
commentary explosion of the number of
molecules or minerals or solid objects

5192
01:24:15,189 --> 01:24:15,199
molecules or minerals or solid objects
 

5193
01:24:15,199 --> 01:24:16,870
molecules or minerals or solid objects
bonds being made

5194
01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:16,880
bonds being made
 

5195
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:19,430
bonds being made
because there's such a large number the

5196
01:24:19,430 --> 01:24:19,440
because there's such a large number the
 

5197
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:21,430
because there's such a large number the
population of different objects that are

5198
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:21,440
population of different objects that are
 

5199
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,270
population of different objects that are
possible this goes back to assembly

5200
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:23,280
possible this goes back to assembly
 

5201
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:25,189
possible this goes back to assembly
theory where assembly theory there's

5202
01:24:25,189 --> 01:24:25,199
theory where assembly theory there's
 

5203
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:27,430
theory where assembly theory there's
four types of universes right so you've

5204
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:27,440
four types of universes right so you've
 

5205
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,910
four types of universes right so you've
got basically a um and this is what one

5206
01:24:29,910 --> 01:24:29,920
got basically a um and this is what one
 

5207
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:31,910
got basically a um and this is what one
was up earlier where

5208
01:24:31,910 --> 01:24:31,920
was up earlier where
 

5209
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:33,430
was up earlier where
one universe where you've just got

5210
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:33,440
one universe where you've just got
 

5211
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:34,870
one universe where you've just got
everything is possible so you can take

5212
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:34,880
everything is possible so you can take
 

5213
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,390
everything is possible so you can take
all the atoms and combine them and make

5214
01:24:36,390 --> 01:24:36,400
all the atoms and combine them and make
 

5215
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:39,189
all the atoms and combine them and make
everything then you've got basically

5216
01:24:39,189 --> 01:24:39,199
everything then you've got basically
 

5217
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:42,550
everything then you've got basically
what is the assembly combinatorial where

5218
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:42,560
what is the assembly combinatorial where
 

5219
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,709
what is the assembly combinatorial where
you basically have to accrue information

5220
01:24:44,709 --> 01:24:44,719
you basically have to accrue information
 

5221
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:47,590
you basically have to accrue information
in steps then you've got um assembly

5222
01:24:47,590 --> 01:24:47,600
in steps then you've got um assembly
 

5223
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,669
in steps then you've got um assembly
observed right and then you've got the

5224
01:24:49,669 --> 01:24:49,679
observed right and then you've got the
 

5225
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:51,750
observed right and then you've got the
object assembly going back so what that

5226
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:51,760
object assembly going back so what that
 

5227
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,669
object assembly going back so what that
mean what i'm trying to say is like if

5228
01:24:53,669 --> 01:24:53,679
mean what i'm trying to say is like if
 

5229
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:55,430
mean what i'm trying to say is like if
you can take atoms and make bonds let's

5230
01:24:55,430 --> 01:24:55,440
you can take atoms and make bonds let's
 

5231
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,270
you can take atoms and make bonds let's
say you take a nitrogen atom and add it

5232
01:24:57,270 --> 01:24:57,280
say you take a nitrogen atom and add it
 

5233
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,430
say you take a nitrogen atom and add it
to a carbon atom you find an amino acid

5234
01:24:59,430 --> 01:24:59,440
to a carbon atom you find an amino acid
 

5235
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:01,030
to a carbon atom you find an amino acid
then you add another carbon atom on in a

5236
01:25:01,030 --> 01:25:01,040
then you add another carbon atom on in a
 

5237
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:02,470
then you add another carbon atom on in a
particular configuration then another

5238
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:02,480
particular configuration then another
 

5239
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:04,550
particular configuration then another
one all different molecules they all

5240
01:25:04,550 --> 01:25:04,560
one all different molecules they all
 

5241
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:07,669
one all different molecules they all
represent different histories

5242
01:25:07,669 --> 01:25:07,679
represent different histories
 

5243
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:10,709
represent different histories
so i would say for me right now the most

5244
01:25:10,709 --> 01:25:10,719
so i would say for me right now the most
 

5245
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:13,110
so i would say for me right now the most
simple route into life seems to be

5246
01:25:13,110 --> 01:25:13,120
simple route into life seems to be
 

5247
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:15,910
simple route into life seems to be
through recording memories and chemistry

5248
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:15,920
through recording memories and chemistry
 

5249
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:17,270
through recording memories and chemistry
but that doesn't mean there can't be

5250
01:25:17,270 --> 01:25:17,280
but that doesn't mean there can't be
 

5251
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,590
but that doesn't mean there can't be
other ways and can't be other emergent

5252
01:25:19,590 --> 01:25:19,600
other ways and can't be other emergent
 

5253
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,070
other ways and can't be other emergent
effects but i i think if you can make

5254
01:25:22,070 --> 01:25:22,080
effects but i i think if you can make
 

5255
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,149
effects but i i think if you can make
bonds and lots of different bonds

5256
01:25:24,149 --> 01:25:24,159
bonds and lots of different bonds
 

5257
01:25:24,159 --> 01:25:27,030
bonds and lots of different bonds
and they those molecules can have a

5258
01:25:27,030 --> 01:25:27,040
and they those molecules can have a
 

5259
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:29,910
and they those molecules can have a
causal effect on the future so imagine a

5260
01:25:29,910 --> 01:25:29,920
causal effect on the future so imagine a
 

5261
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:32,390
causal effect on the future so imagine a
box of atoms

5262
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:32,400
box of atoms
 

5263
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,310
box of atoms
and then then you combine those atoms in

5264
01:25:34,310 --> 01:25:34,320
and then then you combine those atoms in
 

5265
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:37,350
and then then you combine those atoms in
some way so you make molecule

5266
01:25:37,350 --> 01:25:37,360
some way so you make molecule
 

5267
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:38,550
some way so you make molecule
a

5268
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:38,560
a
 

5269
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:41,110
a
from load of atoms and then molecule a

5270
01:25:41,110 --> 01:25:41,120
from load of atoms and then molecule a
 

5271
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:43,030
from load of atoms and then molecule a
can go back to the box

5272
01:25:43,030 --> 01:25:43,040
can go back to the box
 

5273
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,910
can go back to the box
and influence the box

5274
01:25:45,910 --> 01:25:45,920
and influence the box
 

5275
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:47,110
and influence the box
then you make

5276
01:25:47,110 --> 01:25:47,120
then you make
 

5277
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:50,310
then you make
a prime or a b or abc and that process

5278
01:25:50,310 --> 01:25:50,320
a prime or a b or abc and that process
 

5279
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:52,149
a prime or a b or abc and that process
keeps going and that's where the

5280
01:25:52,149 --> 01:25:52,159
keeps going and that's where the
 

5281
01:25:52,159 --> 01:25:55,030
keeps going and that's where the
memories come from is that heterogeneity

5282
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:55,040
memories come from is that heterogeneity
 

5283
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:56,870
memories come from is that heterogeneity
in the universe from bonding

5284
01:25:56,870 --> 01:25:56,880
in the universe from bonding
 

5285
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,070
in the universe from bonding
i don't know if it makes anything and

5286
01:25:58,070 --> 01:25:58,080
i don't know if it makes anything and
 

5287
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:59,430
i don't know if it makes anything and
it's

5288
01:25:59,430 --> 01:25:59,440
it's
 

5289
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:01,750
it's
beginning to flourish

5290
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:01,760
beginning to flourish
 

5291
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:04,149
beginning to flourish
at the chemistry level

5292
01:26:04,149 --> 01:26:04,159
at the chemistry level
 

5293
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:07,270
at the chemistry level
yeah so the physicists have no no

5294
01:26:07,270 --> 01:26:07,280
yeah so the physicists have no no
 

5295
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:10,870
yeah so the physicists have no no
no like not enough yeah the phys i mean

5296
01:26:10,870 --> 01:26:10,880
no like not enough yeah the phys i mean
 

5297
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:13,030
no like not enough yeah the phys i mean
they're like desperately begging well

5298
01:26:13,030 --> 01:26:13,040
they're like desperately begging well
 

5299
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:14,950
they're like desperately begging well
the physicist would claim

5300
01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:14,960
the physicist would claim
 

5301
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:19,189
the physicist would claim
freedom yeah uh and heterogeneous

5302
01:26:19,189 --> 01:26:19,199
freedom yeah uh and heterogeneous
 

5303
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:22,070
freedom yeah uh and heterogeneous
components to play with yeah that's

5304
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:22,080
components to play with yeah that's
 

5305
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:23,830
components to play with yeah that's
exactly it what do you think about that

5306
01:26:23,830 --> 01:26:23,840
exactly it what do you think about that
 

5307
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:26,070
exactly it what do you think about that
sarah i mentioned already i think it's

5308
01:26:26,070 --> 01:26:26,080
sarah i mentioned already i think it's
 

5309
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:27,669
sarah i mentioned already i think it's
significant that whatever physics

5310
01:26:27,669 --> 01:26:27,679
significant that whatever physics
 

5311
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:29,510
significant that whatever physics
governs life emerges actually in

5312
01:26:29,510 --> 01:26:29,520
governs life emerges actually in
 

5313
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:31,669
governs life emerges actually in
chemistry it's not relevant at the

5314
01:26:31,669 --> 01:26:31,679
chemistry it's not relevant at the
 

5315
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:33,510
chemistry it's not relevant at the
subatomic scale or

5316
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:33,520
subatomic scale or
 

5317
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:36,470
subatomic scale or
even at the atomic scale it's in well

5318
01:26:36,470 --> 01:26:36,480
even at the atomic scale it's in well
 

5319
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,229
even at the atomic scale it's in well
atomic scale because chemistry but like

5320
01:26:38,229 --> 01:26:38,239
atomic scale because chemistry but like
 

5321
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:39,590
atomic scale because chemistry but like
when you get into this this

5322
01:26:39,590 --> 01:26:39,600
when you get into this this
 

5323
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,750
when you get into this this
combinatorial diversity that you get

5324
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:41,760
combinatorial diversity that you get
 

5325
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,510
combinatorial diversity that you get
from combining things on the periodic

5326
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:43,520
from combining things on the periodic
 

5327
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:45,910
from combining things on the periodic
table that's when

5328
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:45,920
table that's when
 

5329
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:47,750
table that's when
selection actually matters or the fact

5330
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:47,760
selection actually matters or the fact
 

5331
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,350
selection actually matters or the fact
that some things can exist and others

5332
01:26:49,350 --> 01:26:49,360
that some things can exist and others
 

5333
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,910
that some things can exist and others
can't exist actually starts to matter

5334
01:26:51,910 --> 01:26:51,920
can't exist actually starts to matter
 

5335
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,669
can't exist actually starts to matter
so i think of it like

5336
01:26:53,669 --> 01:26:53,679
so i think of it like
 

5337
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:56,070
so i think of it like
you don't you don't study gravity inside

5338
01:26:56,070 --> 01:26:56,080
you don't you don't study gravity inside
 

5339
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,990
you don't you don't study gravity inside
the atomic nucleus you study it in terms

5340
01:26:57,990 --> 01:26:58,000
the atomic nucleus you study it in terms
 

5341
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,430
the atomic nucleus you study it in terms
of large scale structure of the universe

5342
01:26:59,430 --> 01:26:59,440
of large scale structure of the universe
 

5343
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,270
of large scale structure of the universe
or black holes or things like that and

5344
01:27:01,270 --> 01:27:01,280
or black holes or things like that and
 

5345
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:03,510
or black holes or things like that and
whatever we're talking about as physics

5346
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:03,520
whatever we're talking about as physics
 

5347
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,189
whatever we're talking about as physics
of information or physics of assembly

5348
01:27:05,189 --> 01:27:05,199
of information or physics of assembly
 

5349
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:06,950
of information or physics of assembly
becomes relevant at a certain scale of

5350
01:27:06,950 --> 01:27:06,960
becomes relevant at a certain scale of
 

5351
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:10,229
becomes relevant at a certain scale of
reality and um and the transition that

5352
01:27:10,229 --> 01:27:10,239
reality and um and the transition that
 

5353
01:27:10,239 --> 01:27:11,830
reality and um and the transition that
you're talking about i would think of is

5354
01:27:11,830 --> 01:27:11,840
you're talking about i would think of is
 

5355
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:14,950
you're talking about i would think of is
just when you get a sufficient density

5356
01:27:14,950 --> 01:27:14,960
just when you get a sufficient density
 

5357
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:17,110
just when you get a sufficient density
in terms of the assembly space of like

5358
01:27:17,110 --> 01:27:17,120
in terms of the assembly space of like
 

5359
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:19,510
in terms of the assembly space of like
the relationship of the overlap and and

5360
01:27:19,510 --> 01:27:19,520
the relationship of the overlap and and
 

5361
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:21,510
the relationship of the overlap and and
the assembly space which is like a

5362
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:21,520
the assembly space which is like a
 

5363
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,750
the assembly space which is like a
feature of common memory there is this

5364
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:23,760
feature of common memory there is this
 

5365
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:24,950
feature of common memory there is this
transition

5366
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:24,960
transition
 

5367
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:27,430
transition
um to assembly dominated physics

5368
01:27:27,430 --> 01:27:27,440
um to assembly dominated physics
 

5369
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:28,790
um to assembly dominated physics
whatever that is

5370
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:28,800
whatever that is
 

5371
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,629
whatever that is
oh like when we're talking about and

5372
01:27:30,629 --> 01:27:30,639
oh like when we're talking about and
 

5373
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:31,910
oh like when we're talking about and
we're trying to map out exactly what

5374
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:31,920
we're trying to map out exactly what
 

5375
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:33,669
we're trying to map out exactly what
that transition looks like we're pretty

5376
01:27:33,669 --> 01:27:33,679
that transition looks like we're pretty
 

5377
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:34,709
that transition looks like we're pretty
sure

5378
01:27:34,709 --> 01:27:34,719
sure
 

5379
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:36,390
sure
you know of some of its features but we

5380
01:27:36,390 --> 01:27:36,400
you know of some of its features but we
 

5381
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,149
you know of some of its features but we
haven't done all of that do you think if

5382
01:27:38,149 --> 01:27:38,159
haven't done all of that do you think if
 

5383
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:39,510
haven't done all of that do you think if
you were there in the early universe you

5384
01:27:39,510 --> 01:27:39,520
you were there in the early universe you
 

5385
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,030
you were there in the early universe you
would have been able to predict the

5386
01:27:41,030 --> 01:27:41,040
would have been able to predict the
 

5387
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:43,350
would have been able to predict the
emergence of chemistry and biology and i

5388
01:27:43,350 --> 01:27:43,360
emergence of chemistry and biology and i
 

5389
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,830
emergence of chemistry and biology and i
asked that because at this stage as

5390
01:27:45,830 --> 01:27:45,840
asked that because at this stage as
 

5391
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,990
asked that because at this stage as
humans do you think we can possibly

5392
01:27:47,990 --> 01:27:48,000
humans do you think we can possibly
 

5393
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,590
humans do you think we can possibly
predict

5394
01:27:49,590 --> 01:27:49,600
predict
 

5395
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:52,149
predict
the length of memory that's that might

5396
01:27:52,149 --> 01:27:52,159
the length of memory that's that might
 

5397
01:27:52,159 --> 01:27:54,149
the length of memory that's that might
be able to be formed

5398
01:27:54,149 --> 01:27:54,159
be able to be formed
 

5399
01:27:54,159 --> 01:27:55,510
be able to be formed
later on

5400
01:27:55,510 --> 01:27:55,520
later on
 

5401
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,910
later on
in this pocket in the universe like how

5402
01:27:57,910 --> 01:27:57,920
in this pocket in the universe like how
 

5403
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:59,350
in this pocket in the universe like how
how complex

5404
01:27:59,350 --> 01:27:59,360
how complex
 

5405
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:02,709
how complex
is uh what is the ceiling of assembly

5406
01:28:02,709 --> 01:28:02,719
is uh what is the ceiling of assembly
 

5407
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:04,470
is uh what is the ceiling of assembly
i think as much time as you have in the

5408
01:28:04,470 --> 01:28:04,480
i think as much time as you have in the
 

5409
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:05,910
i think as much time as you have in the
past is how much you can predict in the

5410
01:28:05,910 --> 01:28:05,920
past is how much you can predict in the
 

5411
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,750
past is how much you can predict in the
future because that it's actually

5412
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:07,760
future because that it's actually
 

5413
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,990
future because that it's actually
physical in the system and you have to

5414
01:28:09,990 --> 01:28:10,000
physical in the system and you have to
 

5415
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,990
physical in the system and you have to
have enough time for

5416
01:28:11,990 --> 01:28:12,000
have enough time for
 

5417
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,430
have enough time for
uh

5418
01:28:13,430 --> 01:28:13,440
uh
 

5419
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,669
uh
features of that structure to exist

5420
01:28:15,669 --> 01:28:15,679
features of that structure to exist
 

5421
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:17,430
features of that structure to exist
wait let me push back on that wait god

5422
01:28:17,430 --> 01:28:17,440
wait let me push back on that wait god
 

5423
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:19,270
wait let me push back on that wait god
what isn't that isn't there somewhere in

5424
01:28:19,270 --> 01:28:19,280
what isn't that isn't there somewhere in
 

5425
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:21,030
what isn't that isn't there somewhere in
the universe that's like a shortest path

5426
01:28:21,030 --> 01:28:21,040
the universe that's like a shortest path
 

5427
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:22,709
the universe that's like a shortest path
that's been that stretches all the way

5428
01:28:22,709 --> 01:28:22,719
that's been that stretches all the way
 

5429
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:24,709
that's been that stretches all the way
to the beginning yeah that's building

5430
01:28:24,709 --> 01:28:24,719
to the beginning yeah that's building
 

5431
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:26,629
to the beginning yeah that's building
some giant monster

5432
01:28:26,629 --> 01:28:26,639
some giant monster
 

5433
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:28,390
some giant monster
maybe yeah yes

5434
01:28:28,390 --> 01:28:28,400
maybe yeah yes
 

5435
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,470
maybe yeah yes
so the universe has as much memory as

5436
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:30,480
so the universe has as much memory as
 

5437
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:31,830
so the universe has as much memory as
the largest assembly object in the

5438
01:28:31,830 --> 01:28:31,840
the largest assembly object in the
 

5439
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,750
the largest assembly object in the
universe yeah right but like so you

5440
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:33,760
universe yeah right but like so you
 

5441
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,189
universe yeah right but like so you
can't predict

5442
01:28:35,189 --> 01:28:35,199
can't predict
 

5443
01:28:35,199 --> 01:28:36,950
can't predict
you can't predict any deeper than that

5444
01:28:36,950 --> 01:28:36,960
you can't predict any deeper than that
 

5445
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,430
you can't predict any deeper than that
no right so like that i guess

5446
01:28:39,430 --> 01:28:39,440
no right so like that i guess
 

5447
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:40,709
no right so like that i guess
i'm saying is

5448
01:28:40,709 --> 01:28:40,719
i'm saying is
 

5449
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:42,390
i'm saying is
like what intuition do you have about

5450
01:28:42,390 --> 01:28:42,400
like what intuition do you have about
 

5451
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,790
like what intuition do you have about
complexity living in the world that

5452
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:44,800
complexity living in the world that
 

5453
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,149
complexity living in the world that
you'd have today

5454
01:28:46,149 --> 01:28:46,159
you'd have today
 

5455
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:48,870
you'd have today
right because you you just you can

5456
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:48,880
right because you you just you can
 

5457
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:50,950
right because you you just you can
i mean i guess how long

5458
01:28:50,950 --> 01:28:50,960
i mean i guess how long
 

5459
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,470
i mean i guess how long
um

5460
01:28:52,470 --> 01:28:52,480
um
 

5461
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,629
um
does it get more fun like isn't there

5462
01:28:54,629 --> 01:28:54,639
does it get more fun like isn't there
 

5463
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:55,830
does it get more fun like isn't there
going to be at some point because

5464
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:55,840
going to be at some point because
 

5465
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:57,430
going to be at some point because
there's a there's a heat death in the

5466
01:28:57,430 --> 01:28:57,440
there's a there's a heat death in the
 

5467
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:58,790
there's a there's a heat death in the
universe isn't it

5468
01:28:58,790 --> 01:28:58,800
universe isn't it
 

5469
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:01,590
universe isn't it
going to be a point of the most

5470
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:01,600
going to be a point of the most
 

5471
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:04,229
going to be a point of the most
uh of the highest assembly of object

5472
01:29:04,229 --> 01:29:04,239
uh of the highest assembly of object
 

5473
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:05,910
uh of the highest assembly of object
with the highest probability being

5474
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:05,920
with the highest probability being
 

5475
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:07,830
with the highest probability being
generated when is the universe going to

5476
01:29:07,830 --> 01:29:07,840
generated when is the universe going to
 

5477
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,030
generated when is the universe going to
be the most fun and can we freeze

5478
01:29:09,030 --> 01:29:09,040
be the most fun and can we freeze
 

5479
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:11,110
be the most fun and can we freeze
ourselves and then live then exactly

5480
01:29:11,110 --> 01:29:11,120
ourselves and then live then exactly
 

5481
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:13,189
ourselves and then live then exactly
and will you know when you're having the

5482
01:29:13,189 --> 01:29:13,199
and will you know when you're having the
 

5483
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:15,510
and will you know when you're having the
most fun that this is the best time

5484
01:29:15,510 --> 01:29:15,520
most fun that this is the best time
 

5485
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,270
most fun that this is the best time
you're in your prime are you going to do

5486
01:29:17,270 --> 01:29:17,280
you're in your prime are you going to do
 

5487
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:18,790
you're in your prime are you going to do
what everyone does which is deny that

5488
01:29:18,790 --> 01:29:18,800
what everyone does which is deny that
 

5489
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,470
what everyone does which is deny that
you're in your prime and the best years

5490
01:29:20,470 --> 01:29:20,480
you're in your prime and the best years
 

5491
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,629
you're in your prime and the best years
are still ahead of you

5492
01:29:22,629 --> 01:29:22,639
are still ahead of you
 

5493
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:24,870
are still ahead of you
i don't know what option do you have um

5494
01:29:24,870 --> 01:29:24,880
i don't know what option do you have um
 

5495
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:26,390
i don't know what option do you have um
uh

5496
01:29:26,390 --> 01:29:26,400
uh
 

5497
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,790
uh
i i i mean the problem is with there's a

5498
01:29:28,790 --> 01:29:28,800
i i i mean the problem is with there's a
 

5499
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:29,750
i i i mean the problem is with there's a
lots of

5500
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:29,760
lots of
 

5501
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,270
lots of
lots of really interesting features here

5502
01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:31,280
lots of really interesting features here
 

5503
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:32,550
lots of really interesting features here
i just want to mention one thing that

5504
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:32,560
i just want to mention one thing that
 

5505
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:33,510
i just want to mention one thing that
might be

5506
01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:33,520
might be
 

5507
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:35,270
might be
is i do think assembly theory applies

5508
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:35,280
is i do think assembly theory applies
 

5509
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:37,590
is i do think assembly theory applies
all the way back to subatomic particles

5510
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:37,600
all the way back to subatomic particles
 

5511
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,750
all the way back to subatomic particles
and i also think that cosmological

5512
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:39,760
and i also think that cosmological
 

5513
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,510
and i also think that cosmological
selection might have been actually there

5514
01:29:41,510 --> 01:29:41,520
selection might have been actually there
 

5515
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:42,950
selection might have been actually there
there might be it's not i would say it's

5516
01:29:42,950 --> 01:29:42,960
there might be it's not i would say it's
 

5517
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,149
there might be it's not i would say it's
a really boring bit but it's really

5518
01:29:44,149 --> 01:29:44,159
a really boring bit but it's really
 

5519
01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:46,070
a really boring bit but it's really
important for a cosmologist that the

5520
01:29:46,070 --> 01:29:46,080
important for a cosmologist that the
 

5521
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:47,990
important for a cosmologist that the
universes have gone through was it lee

5522
01:29:47,990 --> 01:29:48,000
universes have gone through was it lee
 

5523
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,750
universes have gone through was it lee
smolin who proposed this maybe that

5524
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:49,760
smolin who proposed this maybe that
 

5525
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,430
smolin who proposed this maybe that
there is this that basically universe

5526
01:29:51,430 --> 01:29:51,440
there is this that basically universe
 

5527
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:53,590
there is this that basically universe
evolves you've got the wrong constants

5528
01:29:53,590 --> 01:29:53,600
evolves you've got the wrong constants
 

5529
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,270
evolves you've got the wrong constants
we'll start again and the most

5530
01:29:55,270 --> 01:29:55,280
we'll start again and the most
 

5531
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:57,189
we'll start again and the most
productive constants where you can allow

5532
01:29:57,189 --> 01:29:57,199
productive constants where you can allow
 

5533
01:29:57,199 --> 01:29:58,950
productive constants where you can allow
particles to form in a certain way get

5534
01:29:58,950 --> 01:29:58,960
particles to form in a certain way get
 

5535
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,390
particles to form in a certain way get
propagated to the next universe we go

5536
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:00,400
propagated to the next universe we go
 

5537
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,550
propagated to the next universe we go
again so actually selection goes all the

5538
01:30:02,550 --> 01:30:02,560
again so actually selection goes all the
 

5539
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:04,070
again so actually selection goes all the
way back and there's these cycle of

5540
01:30:04,070 --> 01:30:04,080
way back and there's these cycle of
 

5541
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:05,990
way back and there's these cycle of
universes and now this universe has been

5542
01:30:05,990 --> 01:30:06,000
universes and now this universe has been
 

5543
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,270
universes and now this universe has been
selected because

5544
01:30:07,270 --> 01:30:07,280
selected because
 

5545
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:10,390
selected because
um life can occur and it carries on but

5546
01:30:10,390 --> 01:30:10,400
um life can occur and it carries on but
 

5547
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,629
um life can occur and it carries on but
i've i've really butchered that there's

5548
01:30:12,629 --> 01:30:12,639
i've i've really butchered that there's
 

5549
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:14,950
i've i've really butchered that there's
a much more so this is some aspect where

5550
01:30:14,950 --> 01:30:14,960
a much more so this is some aspect where
 

5551
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:17,270
a much more so this is some aspect where
through the selection process

5552
01:30:17,270 --> 01:30:17,280
through the selection process
 

5553
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:18,550
through the selection process
there's parameters that are being

5554
01:30:18,550 --> 01:30:18,560
there's parameters that are being
 

5555
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:20,310
there's parameters that are being
fine-tuned and we happen to be living in

5556
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:20,320
fine-tuned and we happen to be living in
 

5557
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:21,590
fine-tuned and we happen to be living in
one where there's some level of

5558
01:30:21,590 --> 01:30:21,600
one where there's some level of
 

5559
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:22,790
one where there's some level of
fine-tuning

5560
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:22,800
fine-tuning
 

5561
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,510
fine-tuning
is there given that

5562
01:30:25,510 --> 01:30:25,520
is there given that
 

5563
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:28,390
is there given that
um can you still man the case that we

5564
01:30:28,390 --> 01:30:28,400
um can you still man the case that we
 

5565
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:31,510
um can you still man the case that we
humans are alone in the universe we are

5566
01:30:31,510 --> 01:30:31,520
humans are alone in the universe we are
 

5567
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:34,390
humans are alone in the universe we are
the highest assembly index object in the

5568
01:30:34,390 --> 01:30:34,400
the highest assembly index object in the
 

5569
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:37,270
the highest assembly index object in the
universe yeah i can i guess sad though i

5570
01:30:37,270 --> 01:30:37,280
universe yeah i can i guess sad though i
 

5571
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:40,070
universe yeah i can i guess sad though i
mean so from is it possible yes

5572
01:30:40,070 --> 01:30:40,080
mean so from is it possible yes
 

5573
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:41,350
mean so from is it possible yes
it's possible

5574
01:30:41,350 --> 01:30:41,360
it's possible
 

5575
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:43,110
it's possible
let's assume

5576
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:43,120
let's assume
 

5577
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:45,030
let's assume
well we we know

5578
01:30:45,030 --> 01:30:45,040
well we we know
 

5579
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:47,350
well we we know
i mean it's possible

5580
01:30:47,350 --> 01:30:47,360
i mean it's possible
 

5581
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:48,470
i mean it's possible
so let me

5582
01:30:48,470 --> 01:30:48,480
so let me
 

5583
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:50,790
so let me
so okay so there is a particular

5584
01:30:50,790 --> 01:30:50,800
so okay so there is a particular
 

5585
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:52,790
so okay so there is a particular
set of elements on earth in a particular

5586
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:52,800
set of elements on earth in a particular

ratio
and the right gravitational constant

5590
01:30:57,189 --> 01:30:57,199
and the right gravitational constant
 

5591
01:30:57,199 --> 01:30:59,910
and the right gravitational constant
and the right viscosity you know of

5592
01:30:59,910 --> 01:30:59,920
and the right viscosity you know of
 

5593
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:01,830
and the right viscosity you know of
staff being able to move around the

5601
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:09,350
moon
um the earth is rotating

5602
01:31:09,350 --> 01:31:09,360
um the earth is rotating
 

5603
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:10,629
um the earth is rotating
um

5604
01:31:10,629 --> 01:31:10,639
um
 

5605
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:13,110
um
the late heavy bombardment produced a

5606
01:31:13,110 --> 01:31:13,120
the late heavy bombardment produced a
 

5607
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:13,990
the late heavy bombardment produced a
lot of

5608
01:31:13,990 --> 01:31:14,000
lot of
 

5609
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,750
lot of
brought in the right stuff and um

5610
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:17,760
brought in the right stuff and um
 

5611
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,910
brought in the right stuff and um
and mars was cooking up cam you know the

5612
01:31:19,910 --> 01:31:19,920
and mars was cooking up cam you know the
 

5613
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:21,830
and mars was cooking up cam you know the
right molecules first so it was

5614
01:31:21,830 --> 01:31:21,840
right molecules first so it was
 

5615
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:23,830
right molecules first so it was
habitable before earth was literally

5616
01:31:23,830 --> 01:31:23,840
habitable before earth was literally
 

5617
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:25,910
habitable before earth was literally
doing the combinatorial search and

5618
01:31:25,910 --> 01:31:25,920
doing the combinatorial search and
 

5619
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:29,510
doing the combinatorial search and
before mars kind of became unhabitable

5620
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:29,520
before mars kind of became unhabitable
 

5621
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:32,390
before mars kind of became unhabitable
it it seeded earth with the right

5622
01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:32,400
it it seeded earth with the right
 

5623
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:34,550
it it seeded earth with the right
molecular replicators

5624
01:31:34,550 --> 01:31:34,560
molecular replicators
 

5625
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:35,990
molecular replicators
and there was just the right stuff on

5626
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:36,000
and there was just the right stuff on
 

5627
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,470
and there was just the right stuff on
earth and that's how the miracle of life

5628
01:31:38,470 --> 01:31:38,480
earth and that's how the miracle of life
 

5629
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,629
earth and that's how the miracle of life
occurred

5630
01:31:40,629 --> 01:31:40,639
occurred
 

5631
01:31:40,639 --> 01:31:42,870
occurred
although i find i'm very uncomfortable

5632
01:31:42,870 --> 01:31:42,880
although i find i'm very uncomfortable
 

5633
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:45,669
although i find i'm very uncomfortable
with that because actually because life

5634
01:31:45,669 --> 01:31:45,679
with that because actually because life
 

5635
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:46,629
with that because actually because life
came

5636
01:31:46,629 --> 01:31:46,639
came
 

5637
01:31:46,639 --> 01:31:50,629
came
so quickly in the earth's past

5638
01:31:50,629 --> 01:31:50,639
so quickly in the earth's past
 

5639
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:52,709
so quickly in the earth's past
but that doesn't mean

5640
01:31:52,709 --> 01:31:52,719
but that doesn't mean
 

5641
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:55,910
but that doesn't mean
that life is easy elsewhere it just

5642
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:55,920
that life is easy elsewhere it just
 

5643
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,910
that life is easy elsewhere it just
might mean that that the the because

5644
01:31:57,910 --> 01:31:57,920
might mean that that the the because
 

5645
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:59,750
might mean that that the the because
chemistry is actually not a long-term

5646
01:31:59,750 --> 01:31:59,760
chemistry is actually not a long-term
 

5647
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:01,350
chemistry is actually not a long-term
thing chemistry can happen quickly so

5648
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:01,360
thing chemistry can happen quickly so
 

5649
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:02,229
thing chemistry can happen quickly so
maybe

5650
01:32:02,229 --> 01:32:02,239
maybe
 

5651
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:03,669
maybe
going on with a steel manning of the

5652
01:32:03,669 --> 01:32:03,679
going on with a steel manning of the
 

5653
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:05,830
going on with a steel manning of the
argument to say actually the fact that

5654
01:32:05,830 --> 01:32:05,840
argument to say actually the fact that
 

5655
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:07,350
argument to say actually the fact that
life emerged quickly doesn't mean that

5656
01:32:07,350 --> 01:32:07,360
life emerged quickly doesn't mean that
 

5657
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,270
life emerged quickly doesn't mean that
life is easy it just means that the

5658
01:32:09,270 --> 01:32:09,280
life is easy it just means that the
 

5659
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:12,310
life is easy it just means that the
chemistry was right on earth and earth

5660
01:32:12,310 --> 01:32:12,320
chemistry was right on earth and earth
 

5661
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,390
chemistry was right on earth and earth
is very special and that's why there's

5662
01:32:14,390 --> 01:32:14,400
is very special and that's why there's
 

5663
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:16,950
is very special and that's why there's
no life anywhere else in the universe

5664
01:32:16,950 --> 01:32:16,960
no life anywhere else in the universe
 

5665
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:19,270
no life anywhere else in the universe
yeah so sarah mentioned this kind of

5666
01:32:19,270 --> 01:32:19,280
yeah so sarah mentioned this kind of
 

5667
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:21,510
yeah so sarah mentioned this kind of
cascading thing

5668
01:32:21,510 --> 01:32:21,520
cascading thing
 

5669
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:23,270
cascading thing
so what if

5670
01:32:23,270 --> 01:32:23,280
so what if
 

5671
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:25,189
so what if
that's the reason we're lucky is that we

5672
01:32:25,189 --> 01:32:25,199
that's the reason we're lucky is that we
 

5673
01:32:25,199 --> 01:32:28,390
that's the reason we're lucky is that we
got to have a rare cascading

5674
01:32:28,390 --> 01:32:28,400
got to have a rare cascading
 

5675
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:31,830
got to have a rare cascading
of um like accelerating cascading effect

5676
01:32:31,830 --> 01:32:31,840
of um like accelerating cascading effect
 

5677
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:34,310
of um like accelerating cascading effect
in terms of the complexity of things

5678
01:32:34,310 --> 01:32:34,320
in terms of the complexity of things
 

5679
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:35,350
in terms of the complexity of things
so like

5680
01:32:35,350 --> 01:32:35,360
so like
 

5681
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:37,590
so like
maybe most of the universe is trying to

5682
01:32:37,590 --> 01:32:37,600
maybe most of the universe is trying to
 

5683
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:39,590
maybe most of the universe is trying to
get sticky with the memory

5684
01:32:39,590 --> 01:32:39,600
get sticky with the memory
 

5685
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,350
get sticky with the memory
and it's not able to really form it and

5686
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:41,360
and it's not able to really form it and
 

5687
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:43,110
and it's not able to really form it and
then we got really lucky in that and it

5688
01:32:43,110 --> 01:32:43,120
then we got really lucky in that and it
 

5689
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:44,390
then we got really lucky in that and it
has nothing

5690
01:32:44,390 --> 01:32:44,400
has nothing
 

5691
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:45,590
has nothing
like there's a lot of earth like

5692
01:32:45,590 --> 01:32:45,600
like there's a lot of earth like
 

5693
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,270
like there's a lot of earth like
conditions let's say

5694
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:47,280
conditions let's say
 

5695
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:48,390
conditions let's say
but it's just

5696
01:32:48,390 --> 01:32:48,400
but it's just
 

5697
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,709
but it's just
you really really have to get lucky on

5698
01:32:50,709 --> 01:32:50,719
you really really have to get lucky on
 

5699
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:51,510
you really really have to get lucky on
this

5700
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:51,520
this
 

5701
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:53,189
this
but i'm doing experiment i'm doing

5702
01:32:53,189 --> 01:32:53,199
but i'm doing experiment i'm doing
 

5703
01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:54,470
but i'm doing experiment i'm doing
experiments right now in fact

5704
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:54,480
experiments right now in fact
 

5705
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:56,229
experiments right now in fact
experiments that sarah and i are working

5706
01:32:56,229 --> 01:32:56,239
experiments that sarah and i are working
 

5707
01:32:56,239 --> 01:32:57,430
experiments that sarah and i are working
on because we have some joint funding

5708
01:32:57,430 --> 01:32:57,440
on because we have some joint funding
 

5709
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,510
on because we have some joint funding
for this where we're seeing that the

5710
01:32:59,510 --> 01:32:59,520
for this where we're seeing that the
 

5711
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,350
for this where we're seeing that the
universe can get sticky really quickly

5712
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:01,360
universe can get sticky really quickly
 

5713
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:03,270
universe can get sticky really quickly
now of course we're being very

5714
01:33:03,270 --> 01:33:03,280
now of course we're being very
 

5715
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:05,270
now of course we're being very
anthropocentric we're using laboratory

5716
01:33:05,270 --> 01:33:05,280
anthropocentric we're using laboratory
 

5717
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:07,750
anthropocentric we're using laboratory
tools we're using theory but actually

5718
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:07,760

01:33:15,750 --> 01:33:15,760
we can do in the lab we're just seeing
 

5727
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:18,229
we can do in the lab we're just seeing
the very first hints of it and

the very first hints of it and
 

5729
01:33:18,239 --> 01:33:20,229
the very first hints of it and
it wouldn't it be great if um we can

5730
01:33:20,229 --> 01:33:20,239
it wouldn't it be great if um we can
 

5731
01:33:20,239 --> 01:33:22,390
it wouldn't it be great if um we can
start to pin down

5732
01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:22,400
start to pin down
 

5733
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,629
start to pin down
a bit more precisely

a bit more precisely
um begin because becoming good

5742
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:32,080
finding out what kind of chemistries we
 

5743
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:34,390
finding out what kind of chemistries we
really need to look for

01:33:34,390 --> 01:33:34,400
really need to look for
 

5745
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:35,910
really need to look for
and i'm becoming increasingly confident

5746
01:33:35,910 --> 01:33:35,920
and i'm becoming increasingly confident
 

5747
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,110
and i'm becoming increasingly confident
we'll be able to do that in the next few

5748
01:33:37,110 --> 01:33:37,120
we'll be able to do that in the next few
 

5749
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:39,430
we'll be able to do that in the next few
years make life in the lab or make some

it be great to get stuff from the moon

5758
01:33:47,830 --> 01:33:47,840
it be great to get stuff from the moon
 

5759
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:51,030
it be great to get stuff from the moon
put it in our origin of life experiment

5760
01:33:51,030 --> 01:33:51,040
put it in our origin of life experiment
 

5761
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:52,870
put it in our origin of life experiment
and make moon life

5762

01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,950
and make moon life
and restrict ourselves to interesting

5764
01:33:54,950 --> 01:33:54,960
and restrict ourselves to interesting
 

5765
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,870
and restrict ourselves to interesting
self-replicating stuff that we find on

5766
01:33:56,870 --> 01:33:56,880
self-replicating stuff that we find on
 

5767
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:57,910
self-replicating stuff that we find on
the moon

5768
01:33:57,910 --> 01:33:57,920
the moon
 

5769
01:33:57,920 --> 01:33:59,990
the moon
well sarah what do you think about this

5770
01:33:59,990 --> 01:34:00,000
well sarah what do you think about this
 

5771
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,229
well sarah what do you think about this
approach of engineering life in order to

5772
01:34:02,229 --> 01:34:02,239
approach of engineering life in order to
 

5773
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:04,870
approach of engineering life in order to
understand life so building life in the

5774
01:34:04,870 --> 01:34:04,880
understand life so building life in the
 

5775
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:06,950
understand life so building life in the
in the machine yeah so

5776
01:34:06,950 --> 01:34:06,960
in the machine yeah so
 

5777
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:10,229
in the machine yeah so
i mean lee and i are trying right now to

5778
01:34:10,229 --> 01:34:10,239
i mean lee and i are trying right now to
 

5779
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:12,149
i mean lee and i are trying right now to
build a vision for

5780
01:34:12,149 --> 01:34:12,159
build a vision for
 

5781
01:34:12,159 --> 01:34:13,910
build a vision for
a large

5782
01:34:13,910 --> 01:34:13,920
a large
 

5783
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:16,149
a large
institute or experimental program

5784
01:34:16,149 --> 01:34:16,159
institute or experimental program
 

5785
01:34:16,159 --> 01:34:17,910
institute or experimental program
basically to do this problem but i think

5786
01:34:17,910 --> 01:34:17,920
basically to do this problem but i think
 

5787
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:19,510
basically to do this problem but i think
of it as like

5788
01:34:19,510 --> 01:34:19,520
of it as like
 

5789
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,189
of it as like
we need to simulate a planet so like the

5790
01:34:21,189 --> 01:34:21,199
we need to simulate a planet so like the
 

5791
01:34:21,199 --> 01:34:23,510
we need to simulate a planet so like the
large hadron collider was supposed to be

5792
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:23,520
large hadron collider was supposed to be
 

5793
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:25,270
large hadron collider was supposed to be
simulating conditions just after the big

5794
01:34:25,270 --> 01:34:25,280
simulating conditions just after the big
 

5795
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,430
simulating conditions just after the big
bang lee built a lot of technology in

5796
01:34:27,430 --> 01:34:27,440
bang lee built a lot of technology in
 

5797
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:28,950
bang lee built a lot of technology in
his lab to do these kind of selection

5798
01:34:28,950 --> 01:34:28,960
his lab to do these kind of selection
 

5799
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:32,229
his lab to do these kind of selection
engines but the question you're asking

5800
01:34:32,229 --> 01:34:32,239
engines but the question you're asking
 

5801
01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:34,390
engines but the question you're asking
is how many experiments do you need to

5802
01:34:34,390 --> 01:34:34,400
is how many experiments do you need to
 

5803
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:36,310
is how many experiments do you need to
run what volume of chemical space do you

5804
01:34:36,310 --> 01:34:36,320
run what volume of chemical space do you
 

5805
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:39,189
run what volume of chemical space do you
need to explore before you actually

5806
01:34:39,189 --> 01:34:39,199
need to explore before you actually
 

5807
01:34:39,199 --> 01:34:41,189
need to explore before you actually
see an event and i like to make an

5808
01:34:41,189 --> 01:34:41,199
see an event and i like to make an
 

5809
01:34:41,199 --> 01:34:42,709
see an event and i like to make an
analogy to one of my favorite particle

5810
01:34:42,709 --> 01:34:42,719
analogy to one of my favorite particle
 

5811
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:44,310
analogy to one of my favorite particle
physics experiments which is super kami

5812
01:34:44,310 --> 01:34:44,320
physics experiments which is super kami
 

5813
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:45,910
physics experiments which is super kami
akande that's looking for the decay of

5814
01:34:45,910 --> 01:34:45,920
akande that's looking for the decay of
 

5815
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:47,350
akande that's looking for the decay of
the proton so this is something that we

5816
01:34:47,350 --> 01:34:47,360
the proton so this is something that we
 

5817
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:49,430
the proton so this is something that we
predicted theoretically but we've never

5818
01:34:49,430 --> 01:34:49,440
predicted theoretically but we've never
 

5819
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:51,830
predicted theoretically but we've never
observed in our universe and basically

5820
01:34:51,830 --> 01:34:51,840
observed in our universe and basically
 

5821
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:53,270
observed in our universe and basically
what they're doing is every time they

5822
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:53,280
what they're doing is every time they
 

5823
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:55,430
what they're doing is every time they
don't see a proton decay event they have

5824
01:34:55,430 --> 01:34:55,440
don't see a proton decay event they have
 

5825
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:56,870
don't see a proton decay event they have
a longer bound on the lifetime of a

5826
01:34:56,870 --> 01:34:56,880
a longer bound on the lifetime of a
 

5827
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:59,430
a longer bound on the lifetime of a
proton so imagine we built an experiment

5828
01:34:59,430 --> 01:34:59,440
proton so imagine we built an experiment
 

5829
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:01,750
proton so imagine we built an experiment
with the idea in mind of trying to

01:35:01,750 --> 01:35:01,760
with the idea in mind of trying to
 

5831
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:03,910
with the idea in mind of trying to
simulate planetary conditions physically

5832
01:35:03,910 --> 01:35:03,920
simulate planetary conditions physically
 

5833
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:05,430
simulate planetary conditions physically
simulate you can't simulate original

5834
01:35:05,430 --> 01:35:05,440
simulate you can't simulate original
 

5835
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:06,709
simulate you can't simulate original
life in the computer you have to do it

5836
01:35:06,709 --> 01:35:06,719
life in the computer you have to do it
 

5837
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:08,229
life in the computer you have to do it
in an experiment

5838
01:35:08,229 --> 01:35:08,239
in an experiment
 

5839
01:35:08,239 --> 01:35:10,790
in an experiment
simulate enough planetary conditions to

5840
01:35:10,790 --> 01:35:10,800
simulate enough planetary conditions to
 

5841
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:12,790
simulate enough planetary conditions to
explore the space what's possible and

5842
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:12,800
explore the space what's possible and
 

5843
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,390
explore the space what's possible and
bound the probability for an original

5844
01:35:14,390 --> 01:35:14,400
bound the probability for an original
 

5845
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:15,910
bound the probability for an original
life event even if you're not observing

5846
01:35:15,910 --> 01:35:15,920
life event even if you're not observing
 

5847
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:17,350
life event even if you're not observing
it you can talk about the probability

5848
01:35:17,350 --> 01:35:17,360
it you can talk about the probability
 

5849
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:19,669
it you can talk about the probability
but we hopefully

5850
01:35:19,669 --> 01:35:19,679
but we hopefully
 

5851
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:20,790
but we hopefully
life is

5852
01:35:20,790 --> 01:35:20,800
life is
 

5853
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,629
life is
not exponentially

not exponentially
 

5855
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:27,030
not exponentially
rare and we would then be able to evolve

5856
01:35:27,030 --> 01:35:27,040
rare and we would then be able to evolve
 

5857
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:30,390
rare and we would then be able to evolve
in an automated system

5858
01:35:30,390 --> 01:35:30,400

 

5859
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,390

alien life in the lab and if we can do

5860
01:35:32,390 --> 01:35:32,400
alien life in the lab and if we can do
 

5861
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:34,229
alien life in the lab and if we can do
that then we understand the physics as

5862
01:35:34,229 --> 01:35:34,239
that then we understand the physics as
 

5863
01:35:34,239 --> 01:35:35,830
that then we understand the physics as
well as we understand what we can do in

5864
01:35:35,830 --> 01:35:35,840
well as we understand what we can do in
 

5865
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,350
well as we understand what we can do in

so keep expanding physically the

5868
01:35:39,189 --> 01:35:39,199
so keep expanding physically the
 

5869
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:40,470
so keep expanding physically the
simulation

5870
01:35:40,470 --> 01:35:40,480

until something happens yeah or just

5874
01:35:45,189 --> 01:35:45,199
until something happens yeah or just
 

5875
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:46,470
until something happens yeah or just
build build a big enough volume of

5876
01:35:46,470 --> 01:35:46,480
build build a big enough volume of
 

5877
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:48,390
build build a big enough volume of
chemical experiments and and evolve them

5878
01:35:48,390 --> 01:35:48,400
chemical experiments and and evolve them
 

5879
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:50,229
chemical experiments and and evolve them
just say volume you mean like literally

5880
01:35:50,229 --> 01:35:50,239
just say volume you mean like literally
 

5881
01:35:50,239 --> 01:35:52,390
just say volume you mean like literally
volume i mean uh physical volume in

5882
01:35:52,390 --> 01:35:52,400
volume i mean uh physical volume in
 

5883
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:53,910
volume i mean uh physical volume in
terms of space but i actually mean

5884
01:35:53,910 --> 01:35:53,920
terms of space but i actually mean
 

5885
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:55,270
terms of space but i actually mean
volume in terms of the combinatorial

5886
01:35:55,270 --> 01:35:55,280
volume in terms of the combinatorial
 

5887
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:57,350

so how do you nicely control the

5890
01:35:59,270 --> 01:35:59,280
so how do you nicely control the
 

5891
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:02,229
so how do you nicely control the
combinatorial exploration the search

5892
01:36:02,229 --> 01:36:02,239
combinatorial exploration the search
 

5893
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:03,350
combinatorial exploration the search

5895
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:05,430
space
such that it's always like

5896
01:36:05,430 --> 01:36:05,440
such that it's always like
 

5897
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:07,910
such that it's always like
you keep grabbing the low-hanging fruit

5898
01:36:07,910 --> 01:36:07,920
you keep grabbing the low-hanging fruit
 

5899
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:09,590
you keep grabbing the low-hanging fruit
yeah how do you build a search engine

5900
01:36:09,590 --> 01:36:09,600
yeah how do you build a search engine
 

5901
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,350
yeah how do you build a search engine
for chemistry

5902
01:36:11,350 --> 01:36:11,360
for chemistry
 

5903
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:12,470
for chemistry
well we should carry on doing this i

5904
01:36:12,470 --> 01:36:12,480
well we should carry on doing this i
 

5905
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:13,750
well we should carry on doing this i
should pretend the physics be the

5906
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:13,760
should pretend the physics be the
 

5907
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:15,750
should pretend the physics be the
physicist you'd be the chemist no so the

5908
01:36:15,750 --> 01:36:15,760
physicist you'd be the chemist no so the
 

5909
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:17,430
physicist you'd be the chemist no so the
way to do it is um

5910
01:36:17,430 --> 01:36:17,440
way to do it is um
 

5911
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:20,070
way to do it is um
i will always play a joke because i i i

5912
01:36:20,070 --> 01:36:20,080
i will always play a joke because i i i
 

5913
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:23,030
i will always play a joke because i i i
like writing grants um uh to ask for you

5914
01:36:23,030 --> 01:36:23,040
like writing grants um uh to ask for you
 

5915
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,990
like writing grants um uh to ask for you
know money to do cool stuff but and i

years ago i started wanting to build so

5918
01:36:29,030 --> 01:36:29,040
years ago i started wanting to build so
 

5919
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:30,950
years ago i started wanting to build so
i actually wanted the weather so i built

5920
01:36:30,950 --> 01:36:30,960
i actually wanted the weather so i built
 

5921
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:32,709
i actually wanted the weather so i built
this robot in my lab called the computer

5922
01:36:32,709 --> 01:36:32,719
this robot in my lab called the computer
 

5923
01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:34,390
this robot in my lab called the computer
which is this robot you can program to

01:36:34,390 --> 01:36:34,400
which is this robot you can program to
 

5925
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:35,750
which is this robot you can program to
do chemistry

5926
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:35,760
do chemistry
 

5927
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:36,550
do chemistry
um

5928
01:36:36,550 --> 01:36:36,560
um
 

5929
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:38,310
um
now it's a pro i made a programming

5930
01:36:38,310 --> 01:36:38,320
now it's a pro i made a programming
 

5931
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:40,229
now it's a pro i made a programming
language for the computer and made it

5932
01:36:40,229 --> 01:36:40,239
language for the computer and made it
 

5933
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:41,430
language for the computer and made it
operate

5934
01:36:41,430 --> 01:36:41,440
operate
 

5935
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:44,310
operate
chemist chemical equipment

5936
01:36:44,310 --> 01:36:44,320
chemist chemical equipment
 

5937
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:46,070
chemist chemical equipment
um originally i wrote grants to say hey

5938
01:36:46,070 --> 01:36:46,080
um originally i wrote grants to say hey
 

5939
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:48,870
um originally i wrote grants to say hey
i want to make an origin of life system

5940
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:48,880
i want to make an origin of life system
 

5941
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:51,030
i want to make an origin of life system
and no one would give me any money

5942
01:36:51,030 --> 01:36:51,040
and no one would give me any money
 

5943
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:53,350
and no one would give me any money
for this this isn't what is ridiculous

5944
01:36:53,350 --> 01:36:53,360
for this this isn't what is ridiculous
 

5945
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:54,629
for this this isn't what is ridiculous
why are you wanting to make oh it's

5946
01:36:54,629 --> 01:36:54,639
why are you wanting to make oh it's
 

5947
01:36:54,639 --> 01:36:56,310
why are you wanting to make oh it's
really hard it takes forever you're not

5948
01:36:56,310 --> 01:36:56,320
really hard it takes forever you're not
 

5949
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:57,910
really hard it takes forever you're not
a very good origin of life chemist

5950
01:36:57,910 --> 01:36:57,920
a very good origin of life chemist
 

5951
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:00,070
a very good origin of life chemist
anyway why would we give you any money

5952
01:37:00,070 --> 01:37:00,080
anyway why would we give you any money
 

5953
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:02,070
anyway why would we give you any money
and so i turned around and said can we

5954
01:37:02,070 --> 01:37:02,080
and so i turned around and said can we
 

5955
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:04,470
and so i turned around and said can we
you can instead can you give me money to

5956
01:37:04,470 --> 01:37:04,480
you can instead can you give me money to
 

5957
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:06,709
you can instead can you give me money to
make robots to make molecules are

5958
01:37:06,709 --> 01:37:06,719
make robots to make molecules are
 

5959
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:08,229
make robots to make molecules are
interesting and everyone went yeah okay

5960
01:37:08,229 --> 01:37:08,239
interesting and everyone went yeah okay
 

5961
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:09,430
interesting and everyone went yeah okay
you can do that

5962
01:37:09,430 --> 01:37:09,440
you can do that
 

5963
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:10,629
you can do that
uh um

5964
01:37:10,629 --> 01:37:10,639
uh um
 

5965
01:37:10,639 --> 01:37:12,390
uh um
and that's so actually the funny thing

5966
01:37:12,390 --> 01:37:12,400
and that's so actually the funny thing
 

5967
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:14,550
and that's so actually the funny thing
is the computer

5968
01:37:14,550 --> 01:37:14,560
is the computer
 

5969
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:17,189
is the computer
um project which i have in my lab which

5970
01:37:17,189 --> 01:37:17,199
um project which i have in my lab which
 

5971
01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:19,109
um project which i have in my lab which
is very briefly it's just basically it's

5972
01:37:19,109 --> 01:37:19,119
is very briefly it's just basically it's
 

5973
01:37:19,119 --> 01:37:20,870
is very briefly it's just basically it's
like literally an automated test tube

5974
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:20,880
like literally an automated test tube
 

5975
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,070
like literally an automated test tube
and we've made a programming language

5976
01:37:22,070 --> 01:37:22,080
and we've made a programming language
 

5977
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:24,470
and we've made a programming language
for the test tube which is cool um

5978
01:37:24,470 --> 01:37:24,480
for the test tube which is cool um
 

5979
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:28,470
for the test tube which is cool um
um has come as literally came from this

5980
01:37:28,470 --> 01:37:28,480
um has come as literally came from this
 

5981
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:29,990
um has come as literally came from this
i went to my lab one day said i want to

5982
01:37:29,990 --> 01:37:30,000
i went to my lab one day said i want to
 

5983
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,669
i went to my lab one day said i want to
make a search engine to get the origin

5984
01:37:31,669 --> 01:37:31,679
make a search engine to get the origin
 

5985
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:33,430
make a search engine to get the origin
of life because i don't have a planet

5986
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:33,440
of life because i don't have a planet
 

5987
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,709
of life because i don't have a planet
and i thought about doing in a

5988
01:37:34,709 --> 01:37:34,719
and i thought about doing in a
 

5989
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:37,109
and i thought about doing in a
microfluidic format so microfluidic is

5990
01:37:37,109 --> 01:37:37,119
microfluidic format so microfluidic is
 

5991
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:38,229
microfluidic format so microfluidic is
very nano

5992
01:37:38,229 --> 01:37:38,239
very nano
 

5993
01:37:38,239 --> 01:37:40,229
very nano
very small channels in device where you

5994
01:37:40,229 --> 01:37:40,239
very small channels in device where you
 

5995
01:37:40,239 --> 01:37:42,229
very small channels in device where you
can basically have all the pipes

5996
01:37:42,229 --> 01:37:42,239
can basically have all the pipes
 

5997
01:37:42,239 --> 01:37:44,229
can basically have all the pipes
produced by lithography and you can have

5998
01:37:44,229 --> 01:37:44,239
produced by lithography and you can have
 

5999
01:37:44,239 --> 01:37:46,629
produced by lithography and you can have
a chamber maybe say between say 10 and

6000
01:37:46,629 --> 01:37:46,639
a chamber maybe say between say 10 and
 

6001
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:48,390
a chamber maybe say between say 10 and
100 microns in volume

6002
01:37:48,390 --> 01:37:48,400
100 microns in volume
 

6003
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:50,390
100 microns in volume
and we slot them all together like lego

6004
01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:50,400
and we slot them all together like lego
 

6005
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:52,709
and we slot them all together like lego
and we can make an origin of life system

6006
01:37:52,709 --> 01:37:52,719
and we can make an origin of life system
 

6007
01:37:52,719 --> 01:37:55,270
and we can make an origin of life system
and i i could never get it to work

6008
01:37:55,270 --> 01:37:55,280
and i i could never get it to work
 

6009
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:57,590
and i i could never get it to work
um and i realized i had to make do

6010
01:37:57,590 --> 01:37:57,600
um and i realized i had to make do
 

6011
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:59,189
um and i realized i had to make do
chemistry at the kind of

6012
01:37:59,189 --> 01:37:59,199
chemistry at the kind of
 

6013
01:37:59,199 --> 01:38:00,950
chemistry at the kind of
test tube level

6014
01:38:00,950 --> 01:38:00,960
test tube level
 

6015
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:03,669
test tube level
and what you want to be able to do yeah

6016
01:38:03,669 --> 01:38:03,679
and what you want to be able to do yeah
 

6017
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:05,590
and what you want to be able to do yeah
yeah it goes back tonight that tweet

6018
01:38:05,590 --> 01:38:05,600
yeah it goes back tonight that tweet
 

6019
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:08,390
yeah it goes back tonight that tweet
1981 1981 the computer we're looking at

6020
01:38:08,390 --> 01:38:08,400
1981 1981 the computer we're looking at
 

6021
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:11,430
1981 1981 the computer we're looking at
a tweet from lee in 1981 the computer

6022
01:38:11,430 --> 01:38:11,440
a tweet from lee in 1981 the computer
 

6023
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:13,189
a tweet from lee in 1981 the computer
was a distant dream

6024
01:38:13,189 --> 01:38:13,199
was a distant dream
 

6025
01:38:13,199 --> 01:38:15,510
was a distant dream
and oh wow this is the scientist looking

6026
01:38:15,510 --> 01:38:15,520
and oh wow this is the scientist looking
 

6027
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:17,270
and oh wow this is the scientist looking
back it is

6028
01:38:17,270 --> 01:38:17,280
back it is
 

6029
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:21,030
back it is
the young boy who dreamed in 2018 it was

6030
01:38:21,030 --> 01:38:21,040
the young boy who dreamed in 2018 it was
 

6031
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:22,229
the young boy who dreamed in 2018 it was
realized

6032
01:38:22,229 --> 01:38:22,239
realized
 

6033
01:38:22,239 --> 01:38:24,790
realized
spelled in a british way realized

6034
01:38:24,790 --> 01:38:24,800
spelled in a british way realized
 

6035
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:27,750
spelled in a british way realized
um

6036
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:27,760

 

6037
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:29,990

so now there's a system that does the

6038
01:38:29,990 --> 01:38:30,000
so now there's a system that does the
 

6039
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,590
so now there's a system that does the
physical manifestation or whatever the

um

6044
01:38:34,470 --> 01:38:34,480
um
 

6045
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:35,669
um
the spec

6046
01:38:35,669 --> 01:38:35,679
the spec
 

6047
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:38,070
the spec
uh tells you to do yeah well in 1981 i

6048
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:38,080
uh tells you to do yeah well in 1981 i
 

6049
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:40,629
uh tells you to do yeah well in 1981 i
got my first computer zx81

6050
01:38:40,629 --> 01:38:40,639
got my first computer zx81
 

6051
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:44,070
got my first computer zx81
what was the computer zx81 zx81

6052
01:38:44,070 --> 01:38:44,080
what was the computer zx81 zx81
 

6053
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:47,109
what was the computer zx81 zx81
sinclair zx81 it was um and i got a

6054
01:38:47,109 --> 01:38:47,119
sinclair zx81 it was um and i got a
 

6055
01:38:47,119 --> 01:38:49,109
sinclair zx81 it was um and i got a
chemistry set

6056
01:38:49,109 --> 01:38:49,119
chemistry set
 

6057
01:38:49,119 --> 01:38:51,910
chemistry set
and i like i like the chemistry set and

6058
01:38:51,910 --> 01:38:51,920
and i like i like the chemistry set and
 

6059
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:53,990
and i like i like the chemistry set and
i like the computer and i just wanted to

6060
01:38:53,990 --> 01:38:54,000
i like the computer and i just wanted to
 

6061
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,430
i like the computer and i just wanted to
put them together i thought wouldn't be

6062
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:55,440
put them together i thought wouldn't be
 

6063
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:56,950
put them together i thought wouldn't be
cool if i could use use the computer to

6064
01:38:56,950 --> 01:38:56,960
cool if i could use use the computer to
 

6065
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:58,709
cool if i could use use the computer to
control the chemistry set

6066
01:38:58,709 --> 01:38:58,719
control the chemistry set
 

6067
01:38:58,719 --> 01:39:00,709
control the chemistry set
and um and obviously that was insane and

6068
01:39:00,709 --> 01:39:00,719
and um and obviously that was insane and
 

6069
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:02,870
and um and obviously that was insane and
i was like

6070
01:39:02,870 --> 01:39:02,880
i was like
 

6071
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:04,390
i was like
you know eight years old right nine

6072
01:39:04,390 --> 01:39:04,400
you know eight years old right nine
 

6073
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,870
you know eight years old right nine
years going on nine years old and um and

6074
01:39:06,870 --> 01:39:06,880
years going on nine years old and um and
 

6075
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:09,669
years going on nine years old and um and
then i i

6076
01:39:09,669 --> 01:39:09,679
then i i
 

6077
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:12,390
then i i
i invented the computer

6078
01:39:12,390 --> 01:39:12,400
i invented the computer
 

6079
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:13,510
i invented the computer
just because i wanted to build this

6080
01:39:13,510 --> 01:39:13,520
just because i wanted to build this
 

6081
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:15,270
just because i wanted to build this
origin of life grid

6082
01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:15,280

what we i think sarah and i have been
 

6097
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:31,430
what we i think sarah and i have been
thinking very deeply about because um

6098
01:39:31,430 --> 01:39:31,440
thinking very deeply about because um
 

6099
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:32,870
thinking very deeply about because um
you know there's more money being spent

6100
01:39:32,870 --> 01:39:32,880
you know there's more money being spent
 

6101
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:33,830
you know there's more money being spent
on the

6102

on the
 

6103
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:36,229
on the

the origin of life
 

6111
01:39:41,119 --> 01:39:43,830
the origin of life
is the i think the biggest question or

6112
01:39:43,830 --> 01:39:43,840
is the i think the biggest question or
 

6113
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:45,669
is the i think the biggest question or
not the biggest question it is a big

6114
01:39:45,669 --> 01:39:45,679
not the biggest question it is a big
 

6115
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:47,030
not the biggest question it is a big
question let's put it that way the

6116
01:39:47,030 --> 01:39:47,040
question let's put it that way the
 

6117
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:49,030
question let's put it that way the
biggest question you're okay saying that

6118
01:39:49,030 --> 01:39:49,040
biggest question you're okay saying that
 

6119
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:50,629
biggest question you're okay saying that
okay all right

6120
01:39:50,629 --> 01:39:50,639
okay all right
 

6121
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:51,910
okay all right
isn't it possible once you figure out

6122
01:39:51,910 --> 01:39:51,920
isn't it possible once you figure out
 

6123
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:53,510
isn't it possible once you figure out
the origin of life that that's not going

6124
01:39:53,510 --> 01:39:53,520
the origin of life that that's not going
 

6125
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:54,870
the origin of life that that's not going
to solve

6126
01:39:54,870 --> 01:39:54,880
to solve
 

6127
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:55,750
to solve
um

6128
01:39:55,750 --> 01:39:55,760
um
 

6129
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:57,990
um
that's not actually going to solve

6130
01:39:57,990 --> 01:39:58,000
that's not actually going to solve
 

6131
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,149
that's not actually going to solve
the question of what is life

6132
01:40:00,149 --> 01:40:00,159
the question of what is life
 

6133
01:40:00,159 --> 01:40:01,910
the question of what is life
like is isn't it because you're kind of

6134
01:40:01,910 --> 01:40:01,920
like is isn't it because you're kind of
 

6135
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,590
like is isn't it because you're kind of
putting a lot of yeah i think that's the

6136
01:40:03,590 --> 01:40:03,600
putting a lot of yeah i think that's the
 

6137
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:06,070
putting a lot of yeah i think that's the
same problem but you're putting is it

6138
01:40:06,070 --> 01:40:06,080
same problem but you're putting is it
 

6139
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:07,510
same problem but you're putting is it
possible that you're

6140
01:40:07,510 --> 01:40:07,520
possible that you're
 

6141
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:09,750
possible that you're
putting too many um

6142
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:09,760
putting too many um
 

6143
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:11,910
putting too many um
too much bets into this origin part

6144
01:40:11,910 --> 01:40:11,920
too much bets into this origin part
 

6145
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:13,990
too much bets into this origin part
maybe the origin thing isn't

6146
01:40:13,990 --> 01:40:14,000
maybe the origin thing isn't
 

6147
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,830
maybe the origin thing isn't
isn't there always a turtle underneath

6148
01:40:15,830 --> 01:40:15,840
isn't there always a turtle underneath
 

6149
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:17,590
isn't there always a turtle underneath
the turtle isn't it a stack of turtles

6150
01:40:17,590 --> 01:40:17,600
the turtle isn't it a stack of turtles
 

6151
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:19,430
the turtle isn't it a stack of turtles
because then if you create it in the lab

6152
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:19,440
because then if you create it in the lab
 

6153
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:21,669
because then if you create it in the lab
maybe you need some other stuff well

6154
01:40:21,669 --> 01:40:21,679
maybe you need some other stuff well
 

6155
01:40:21,679 --> 01:40:24,310
maybe you need some other stuff well
that's nothing but they already like you

6156
01:40:24,310 --> 01:40:24,320
that's nothing but they already like you
 

6157
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:26,950
that's nothing but they already like you
like in the lab there's still memory

6158
01:40:26,950 --> 01:40:26,960
like in the lab there's still memory
 

6159
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:30,310
like in the lab there's still memory
yeah yes right the experiment is already

6160
01:40:30,310 --> 01:40:30,320
yeah yes right the experiment is already
 

6161
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:32,310
yeah yes right the experiment is already
the product of evolution right in some

6162
01:40:32,310 --> 01:40:32,320
the product of evolution right in some
 

6163
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:34,790
the product of evolution right in some
maybe really deep way not an obvious way

6164
01:40:34,790 --> 01:40:34,800
maybe really deep way not an obvious way
 

6165
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:37,750
maybe really deep way not an obvious way
it's a very deep way yeah so maybe uh

6166
01:40:37,750 --> 01:40:37,760
it's a very deep way yeah so maybe uh
 

6167
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:39,510
it's a very deep way yeah so maybe uh
the haters are always going to be like

6168
01:40:39,510 --> 01:40:39,520
the haters are always going to be like
 

6169
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:40,470
the haters are always going to be like
well

6170
01:40:40,470 --> 01:40:40,480
well
 

6171
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:42,070
well
you have to reconstruct the full do you

6172
01:40:42,070 --> 01:40:42,080
you have to reconstruct the full do you
 

6173
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:43,590
you have to reconstruct the full do you
have to build it fortunately for us the

6174
01:40:43,590 --> 01:40:43,600
have to build it fortunately for us the
 

6175
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:46,709
have to build it fortunately for us the
haters are not aware of that argument

6176
01:40:46,709 --> 01:40:46,719
haters are not aware of that argument
 

6177
01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:48,390
haters are not aware of that argument
well no i know i know you're the one

6178
01:40:48,390 --> 01:40:48,400
well no i know i know you're the one
 

6179
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:50,390
well no i know i know you're the one
making that argument usually but

6180
01:40:50,390 --> 01:40:50,400
making that argument usually but
 

6181
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:52,550
making that argument usually but
yeah i just think that

6182
01:40:52,550 --> 01:40:52,560
yeah i just think that
 

6183
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:54,870
yeah i just think that
if we create life in the lab it's not

6184
01:40:54,870 --> 01:40:54,880
if we create life in the lab it's not
 

6185
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:57,350
if we create life in the lab it's not
obvious that you'll get to the deep deep

6186
01:40:57,350 --> 01:40:57,360
obvious that you'll get to the deep deep
 

6187
01:40:57,360 --> 01:41:00,629
obvious that you'll get to the deep deep

6189
01:41:00,639 --> 01:41:02,229

what is the line between life and

6190
01:41:02,229 --> 01:41:02,239
what is the line between life and
 

6191
01:41:02,239 --> 01:41:04,629
what is the line between life and
non-life no i think so there's so much

6192
01:41:04,629 --> 01:41:04,639
non-life no i think so there's so much
 

6193
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:06,229
non-life no i think so there's so much
here i'm just saying god playing devil

01:41:06,239 --> 01:41:08,149
here i'm just saying god playing devil
so much here but let me play devil's

6196

you know let's kind of let's find some

6264
01:42:19,990 --> 01:42:20,000
you know let's kind of let's find some

long-term memory
 

6313
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:11,590
long-term memory
uh well while the individual components

6314
01:43:11,590 --> 01:43:11,600
uh well while the individual components
 

6315
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:13,270
uh well while the individual components
don't seem like they have any memory at

don't seem like they have any memory at
all

6318
01:43:14,070 --> 01:43:14,080
all
 

6319
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:15,510
all
yeah it's just fascinating the argument

6320
01:43:15,510 --> 01:43:15,520
yeah it's just fascinating the argument
 

6321
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:16,790
yeah it's just fascinating the argument
here is um

6322
01:43:16,790 --> 01:43:16,800
here is um
 

6323
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:18,870
here is um
that has to exist on all this layer of

6324
01:43:18,870 --> 01:43:18,880
that has to exist on all this layer of
 

6325
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:20,470
that has to exist on all this layer of
infrastructure right and though it looks

6326
01:43:20,470 --> 01:43:20,480
infrastructure right and though it looks
 

6327
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:21,430
infrastructure right and though it looks
simple

6328
01:43:21,430 --> 01:43:21,440
simple
 

6329
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:22,790
simple
and then what i would make the argument

6330
01:43:22,790 --> 01:43:22,800
and then what i would make the argument
 

6331
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:24,629
and then what i would make the argument
i would make a value say well i think

6332
01:43:24,629 --> 01:43:24,639
i would make a value say well i think
 

6333
01:43:24,639 --> 01:43:27,189
i would make a value say well i think
cas are really simple and everywhere is

6334
01:43:27,189 --> 01:43:27,199
cas are really simple and everywhere is
 

6335
01:43:27,199 --> 01:43:28,709
cas are really simple and everywhere is
safe show me how they emerge and

6336
01:43:28,709 --> 01:43:28,719
safe show me how they emerge and
 

6337
01:43:28,719 --> 01:43:30,390
safe show me how they emerge and
substrate now let's go to the origin of

6338
01:43:30,390 --> 01:43:30,400
substrate now let's go to the origin of
 

6339
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:33,109
substrate now let's go to the origin of
life where or machine i don't think we

6340
01:43:33,109 --> 01:43:33,119
life where or machine i don't think we
 

6341
01:43:33,119 --> 01:43:35,350
life where or machine i don't think we
want to do the origin of life just any

6342
01:43:35,350 --> 01:43:35,360
want to do the origin of life just any
 

6343
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:37,510
want to do the origin of life just any
origin is good so we do so we literally

6344
01:43:37,510 --> 01:43:37,520
origin is good so we do so we literally
 

6345
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:40,470
origin is good so we do so we literally
have our sand shaker shake the sand like

6346
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:40,480
have our sand shaker shake the sand like
 

6347
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:42,149
have our sand shaker shake the sand like
massive grid of chemistry experiments

6348

shaking sand shaking whatever

6350
01:43:45,109 --> 01:43:45,119
shaking sand shaking whatever
 

6351
01:43:45,119 --> 01:43:46,870
shaking sand shaking whatever
and then because we know what we've put

6352
01:43:46,870 --> 01:43:46,880
and then because we know what we've put
 

6353
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:48,390
and then because we know what we've put
in so we know where how we've cheated

6354
01:43:48,390 --> 01:43:48,400
in so we know where how we've cheated
 

6355
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:49,669
in so we know where how we've cheated
and the same way with ca we know how

6356
01:43:49,669 --> 01:43:49,679
and the same way with ca we know how
 

6357
01:43:49,679 --> 01:43:50,870
and the same way with ca we know how
we've cheated we know what the micro we

6358
01:43:50,870 --> 01:43:50,880
we've cheated we know what the micro we
 

6359
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:52,229
we've cheated we know what the micro we
know the number of operations needed we

6360
01:43:52,229 --> 01:43:52,239
know the number of operations needed we
 

6361
01:43:52,239 --> 01:43:54,470
know the number of operations needed we
know how big a grid we want to get this

6362
01:43:54,470 --> 01:43:54,480
know how big a grid we want to get this
 

6363
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:58,229
know how big a grid we want to get this
if we could then say okay how can we

6364
01:43:58,229 --> 01:43:58,239
if we could then say okay how can we
 

6365
01:43:58,239 --> 01:43:59,350
if we could then say okay how can we
um

6366
01:43:59,350 --> 01:43:59,360
um
 

6367
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:01,669
um
generate this recipe in the lab and make

6368
01:44:01,669 --> 01:44:01,679
generate this recipe in the lab and make
 

6369
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:03,430
generate this recipe in the lab and make
a life form

6370
01:44:03,430 --> 01:44:03,440
a life form
 

6371
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:05,430
a life form
what were the what contingency did we

6372
01:44:05,430 --> 01:44:05,440
what were the what contingency did we
 

6373
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:07,109
what were the what contingency did we
need to put in and we're up front about

6374
01:44:07,109 --> 01:44:07,119
need to put in and we're up front about
 

6375
01:44:07,119 --> 01:44:08,629
need to put in and we're up front about
how we cheated

6376
01:44:08,629 --> 01:44:08,639
how we cheated
 

6377
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:11,030
how we cheated
okay say oh you had to shake it was it

6378
01:44:11,030 --> 01:44:11,040
okay say oh you had to shake it was it
 

6379
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:13,910
okay say oh you had to shake it was it
periodic planet rotates

6380
01:44:13,910 --> 01:44:13,920
periodic planet rotates
 

6381
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:16,149
periodic planet rotates
it's tried comes in and out so and then

6382
01:44:16,149 --> 01:44:16,159
it's tried comes in and out so and then
 

6383
01:44:16,159 --> 01:44:19,109
it's tried comes in and out so and then
we can start to basically say okay how

6384
01:44:19,109 --> 01:44:19,119
we can start to basically say okay how
 

6385
01:44:19,119 --> 01:44:22,149
we can start to basically say okay how
difficult is it for these features to be

6386
01:44:22,149 --> 01:44:22,159
difficult is it for these features to be
 

6387
01:44:22,159 --> 01:44:23,750
difficult is it for these features to be
found and then we can look for

6388
01:44:23,750 --> 01:44:23,760
found and then we can look for
 

6389
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:26,470
found and then we can look for
exoplanets and other features so i think

6390
01:44:26,470 --> 01:44:26,480
exoplanets and other features so i think
 

6391
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:27,990
exoplanets and other features so i think
sarah's absolutely right we want to

6392
01:44:27,990 --> 01:44:28,000
sarah's absolutely right we want to
 

6393
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,590
sarah's absolutely right we want to
explain to people we're cheating in fact

6394
01:44:29,590 --> 01:44:29,600
explain to people we're cheating in fact
 

6395
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:31,750
explain to people we're cheating in fact
we have to cheat no one has given i'm

6396
01:44:31,750 --> 01:44:31,760
we have to cheat no one has given i'm
 

6397
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:33,109
we have to cheat no one has given i'm
good at writing grants i used to be i'm

6398
01:44:33,109 --> 01:44:33,119
good at writing grants i used to be i'm
 

6399
01:44:33,119 --> 01:44:34,629
good at writing grants i used to be i'm
not very good right now keep getting

01:44:34,629 --> 01:44:34,639
not very good right now keep getting
 

6401
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:36,390
not very good right now keep getting
rejected but i writing a grant for a

6402
01:44:36,390 --> 01:44:36,400
rejected but i writing a grant for a
 

6403
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:38,390
rejected but i writing a grant for a
planet and 100 million years no grant

fund there is going to give me that but

6406
01:44:39,830 --> 01:44:39,840
fund there is going to give me that but
 

6407
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:42,790
fund there is going to give me that but
maybe money to make a a kind of a grid a

6408
01:44:42,790 --> 01:44:42,800
maybe money to make a a kind of a grid a
 

6409
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:44,470
maybe money to make a a kind of a grid a
computer grid

6410
01:44:44,470 --> 01:44:44,480
computer grid
 

6411
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:46,790
computer grid
origin of life computing into this space

6412
01:44:46,790 --> 01:44:46,800
origin of life computing into this space
 

6413
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:49,270
origin of life computing into this space
in physical space and just do it so

6414
01:44:49,270 --> 01:44:49,280
in physical space and just do it so
 

6415
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:52,790
in physical space and just do it so
sarah said something which is you can't

6416
01:44:52,790 --> 01:44:52,800
sarah said something which is you can't
 

6417
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:55,669
sarah said something which is you can't
simulate the or engine of life in a in a

6418
01:44:55,669 --> 01:44:55,679
simulate the or engine of life in a in a
 

6419
01:44:55,679 --> 01:44:58,470
simulate the or engine of life in a in a
computer so like in simulation

6420
01:44:58,470 --> 01:44:58,480
computer so like in simulation
 

6421
01:44:58,480 --> 01:44:59,430
computer so like in simulation
why not

6422
01:44:59,430 --> 01:44:59,440
why not
 

6423
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:01,510
why not
what what were your you said it very

6424
01:45:01,510 --> 01:45:01,520
what what were your you said it very
 

6425
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:04,870
what what were your you said it very
confidently so yeah is it possible

6426
01:45:04,870 --> 01:45:04,880
confidently so yeah is it possible
 

6427
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:07,030
confidently so yeah is it possible
and why would it be very difficult like

6428
01:45:07,030 --> 01:45:07,040
and why would it be very difficult like
 

6429
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:08,790
and why would it be very difficult like
what's your intuition there

6430
01:45:08,790 --> 01:45:08,800
what's your intuition there
 

6431
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:10,149
what's your intuition there
i think

6432
01:45:10,149 --> 01:45:10,159
i think
 

6433
01:45:10,159 --> 01:45:12,149
i think
it's very difficult right now because we

6434
01:45:12,149 --> 01:45:12,159
it's very difficult right now because we
 

6435
01:45:12,159 --> 01:45:13,510
it's very difficult right now because we
don't know the physics but if you go

6436
01:45:13,510 --> 01:45:13,520
don't know the physics but if you go
 

6437
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:15,109
don't know the physics but if you go
based on principles of assembly theory

6438
01:45:15,109 --> 01:45:15,119
based on principles of assembly theory
 

6439
01:45:15,119 --> 01:45:17,189
based on principles of assembly theory
and you think every molecule is actually

6440
01:45:17,189 --> 01:45:17,199
and you think every molecule is actually
 

6441
01:45:17,199 --> 01:45:18,950
and you think every molecule is actually
a very large causal graph not just the

6442
01:45:18,950 --> 01:45:18,960
a very large causal graph not just the
 

6443
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:21,030
a very large causal graph not just the
molecule then you have to simulate all

6444
01:45:21,030 --> 01:45:21,040
molecule then you have to simulate all
 

6445
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:22,550
molecule then you have to simulate all
the features of those causal graphs and

6446
01:45:22,550 --> 01:45:22,560
the features of those causal graphs and
 

6447
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:24,070
the features of those causal graphs and
i think it becomes computationally

6448
01:45:24,070 --> 01:45:24,080
i think it becomes computationally
 

6449
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:25,430
i think it becomes computationally
intractable you might as well just build

6450
01:45:25,430 --> 01:45:25,440
intractable you might as well just build
 

6451
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:26,790
intractable you might as well just build
the experiment

6452
01:45:26,790 --> 01:45:26,800
the experiment
 

6453
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:28,550
the experiment
because you have in the physical space

6454
01:45:28,550 --> 01:45:28,560
because you have in the physical space
 

6455
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:30,790
because you have in the physical space
you have all the objects with all the

6456
01:45:30,790 --> 01:45:30,800
you have all the objects with all the
 

6457
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:32,390
you have all the objects with all the
memories yes

6458
01:45:32,390 --> 01:45:32,400
memories yes
 

6459
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:34,709
memories yes
and in the computer you would have to

6460
01:45:34,709 --> 01:45:34,719
and in the computer you would have to
 

6461
01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:37,510
and in the computer you would have to
copy them and reconstruct yes

6462
01:45:37,510 --> 01:45:37,520
copy them and reconstruct yes
 

6463
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:39,030
copy them and reconstruct yes
that's a beautifully put and i would say

6464
01:45:39,030 --> 01:45:39,040
that's a beautifully put and i would say
 

6465
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:39,830
that's a beautifully put and i would say
that

6466
01:45:39,830 --> 01:45:39,840
that
 

6467
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:41,750
that
lots of people

6468
01:45:41,750 --> 01:45:41,760
lots of people
 

6469
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:45,109
lots of people
you you just don't have enough resources

6470
01:45:45,109 --> 01:45:45,119
you you just don't have enough resources
 

6471
01:45:45,119 --> 01:45:47,189
you you just don't have enough resources
it's easier to actually do the physical

6472
01:45:47,189 --> 01:45:47,199
it's easier to actually do the physical
 

6473
01:45:47,199 --> 01:45:48,629
it's easier to actually do the physical
experiment because

6474
01:45:48,629 --> 01:45:48,639
experiment because
 

6475
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:50,390
experiment because
we are literally i would view the

6476
01:45:50,390 --> 01:45:50,400
we are literally i would view the
 

6477
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:51,750
we are literally i would view the
physical experiment almost like a

6478
01:45:51,750 --> 01:45:51,760
physical experiment almost like a
 

6479
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:53,750
physical experiment almost like a
computational experiment we're just

6480
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:53,760
computational experiment we're just
 

6481
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:55,030
computational experiment we're just
outsourcing it's just basically we're

6482
01:45:55,030 --> 01:45:55,040
outsourcing it's just basically we're
 

6483
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:57,510
outsourcing it's just basically we're
just outsourcing all the matrix

6484
01:45:57,510 --> 01:45:57,520
just outsourcing all the matrix
 

6485
01:45:57,520 --> 01:45:59,510
just outsourcing all the matrix
and algebra on your point about the

6486
01:45:59,510 --> 01:45:59,520
and algebra on your point about the
 

6487
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,030
and algebra on your point about the
experiment being

6488
01:46:01,030 --> 01:46:01,040
experiment being
 

6489
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:02,229
experiment being
also

6490
01:46:02,229 --> 01:46:02,239
also
 

6491
01:46:02,239 --> 01:46:04,550
also
an example of life it's almost like you

6492
01:46:04,550 --> 01:46:04,560
an example of life it's almost like you
 

6493
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:06,390
an example of life it's almost like you
want to design it's like you know all of

6494
01:46:06,390 --> 01:46:06,400
want to design it's like you know all of
 

6495
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:07,750
want to design it's like you know all of
us are

6496
01:46:07,750 --> 01:46:07,760
us are
 

6497
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:09,350
us are
lineages of propagating information

6498
01:46:09,350 --> 01:46:09,360
lineages of propagating information
 

6499
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:11,109
lineages of propagating information
across time and so everything we do

6500
01:46:11,109 --> 01:46:11,119
across time and so everything we do
 

6501
01:46:11,119 --> 01:46:12,709
across time and so everything we do
becomes part of life because it's part

6502
01:46:12,709 --> 01:46:12,719
becomes part of life because it's part
 

6503
01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:14,550
becomes part of life because it's part
of that causal chain so it's like you

6504
01:46:14,550 --> 01:46:14,560
of that causal chain so it's like you
 

6505
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:16,390
of that causal chain so it's like you
want to try to pinch off as much as you

6506
01:46:16,390 --> 01:46:16,400
want to try to pinch off as much as you
 

6507
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:18,310
want to try to pinch off as much as you
can of the information from your causal

6508
01:46:18,310 --> 01:46:18,320
can of the information from your causal
 

6509
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:20,149
can of the information from your causal
chain that goes into the experiment but

6510
01:46:20,149 --> 01:46:20,159
chain that goes into the experiment but
 

6511
01:46:20,159 --> 01:46:22,229
chain that goes into the experiment but
you can't pinch off all of it to move it

6512
01:46:22,229 --> 01:46:22,239
you can't pinch off all of it to move it
 

6513
01:46:22,239 --> 01:46:23,830
you can't pinch off all of it to move it
to like a different timeline it's always

6514
01:46:23,830 --> 01:46:23,840
to like a different timeline it's always
 

6515
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:25,270
to like a different timeline it's always
going to be part of your timeline but at

6516
01:46:25,270 --> 01:46:25,280
going to be part of your timeline but at
 

6517
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:26,470
going to be part of your timeline but at
least if you can control how much

6518
01:46:26,470 --> 01:46:26,480
least if you can control how much
 

6519
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:27,910
least if you can control how much
information you put in you can try to

6520
01:46:27,910 --> 01:46:27,920
information you put in you can try to
 

6521
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:29,830
information you put in you can try to
see how much does that particular

6522
01:46:29,830 --> 01:46:29,840
see how much does that particular
 

6523
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:32,550
see how much does that particular
trajectory you set up start generating

6524
01:46:32,550 --> 01:46:32,560
trajectory you set up start generating
 

6525
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:34,950
trajectory you set up start generating
its own assembly so you you know where

6526
01:46:34,950 --> 01:46:34,960
its own assembly so you you know where
 

6527
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:36,790
its own assembly so you you know where
it starts and then you want to try to

6528
01:46:36,790 --> 01:46:36,800
it starts and then you want to try to
 

6529
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,950
it starts and then you want to try to
see it take off on its own when you try

6530
01:46:38,950 --> 01:46:38,960
see it take off on its own when you try
 

6531
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:42,070
see it take off on its own when you try
to pinch it off as much as possible

6532
01:46:42,070 --> 01:46:42,080
to pinch it off as much as possible
 

6533
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:43,590
to pinch it off as much as possible
got it

6534
01:46:43,590 --> 01:46:43,600
got it
 

6535
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:46,149
got it
quick pause bath break yes all right

6536
01:46:46,149 --> 01:46:46,159
quick pause bath break yes all right
 

6537
01:46:46,159 --> 01:46:47,430
quick pause bath break yes all right
cool

6538
01:46:47,430 --> 01:46:47,440
cool
 

6539
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:49,430
cool
and now we're back

6540
01:46:49,430 --> 01:46:49,440
and now we're back
 

6541
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:50,790
and now we're back
all right

6542
01:46:50,790 --> 01:46:50,800
all right
 

6543
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:53,030
all right
we talked about the early days of the

6544
01:46:53,030 --> 01:46:53,040
we talked about the early days of the
 

6545
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:54,470
we talked about the early days of the
universe when there was just stuff and

6546
01:46:54,470 --> 01:46:54,480
universe when there was just stuff and
 

6547
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:55,830
universe when there was just stuff and
no memory

6548
01:46:55,830 --> 01:46:55,840
no memory
 

6549
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:58,070
no memory
not even causality i think lee at least

6550
01:46:58,070 --> 01:46:58,080
not even causality i think lee at least
 

6551
01:46:58,080 --> 01:46:59,669
not even causality i think lee at least
implied the causality's immersion

6552
01:46:59,669 --> 01:46:59,679
implied the causality's immersion
 

6553
01:46:59,679 --> 01:47:01,990
implied the causality's immersion
somehow we could discuss this what

6554
01:47:01,990 --> 01:47:02,000
somehow we could discuss this what
 

6555
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,430
somehow we could discuss this what
happened before

6556
01:47:05,430 --> 01:47:05,440

 

6557
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:07,189

this all originated

6558
01:47:07,189 --> 01:47:07,199
this all originated
 

6559
01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:10,470
this all originated
what's outside the universe

6560
01:47:10,470 --> 01:47:10,480
what's outside the universe
 

6561
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:11,990
what's outside the universe
divided by zero

6562
01:47:11,990 --> 01:47:12,000
divided by zero
 

6563
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,669
divided by zero
okay so it's not

6564
01:47:13,669 --> 01:47:13,679
okay so it's not
 

6565
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:16,229
okay so it's not
it's not relevant not understandable

6566
01:47:16,229 --> 01:47:16,239
it's not relevant not understandable
 

6567
01:47:16,239 --> 01:47:20,870
it's not relevant not understandable
is it useful to even ask the question

6568
01:47:20,870 --> 01:47:20,880

 

6569
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:23,109

because it's so hard no it's not hard

6570
01:47:23,109 --> 01:47:23,119
because it's so hard no it's not hard
 

6571
01:47:23,119 --> 01:47:24,790
because it's so hard no it's not hard
it's just not a question

6572
01:47:24,790 --> 01:47:24,800
it's just not a question
 

6573
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,229
it's just not a question
if i can't do an experiment or even

6574
01:47:26,229 --> 01:47:26,239
if i can't do an experiment or even
 

6575
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:27,910
if i can't do an experiment or even
think of experiment the question doesn't

6576
01:47:27,910 --> 01:47:27,920
think of experiment the question doesn't
 

6577
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:29,430
think of experiment the question doesn't
exist

6578
01:47:29,430 --> 01:47:29,440
exist
 

6579
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:31,430
exist
well no you can't think of a lot of

6580
01:47:31,430 --> 01:47:31,440
well no you can't think of a lot of
 

6581
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:33,990
well no you can't think of a lot of
experiments no effects

6582
01:47:33,990 --> 01:47:34,000
experiments no effects
 

6583
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,310
experiments no effects
what i mean is your causality graph is

6584
01:47:36,310 --> 01:47:36,320
what i mean is your causality graph is
 

6585
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,990
what i mean is your causality graph is
like this is what we've been talking

6586
01:47:37,990 --> 01:47:38,000
like this is what we've been talking
 

6587
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:38,950
like this is what we've been talking
about

6588
01:47:38,950 --> 01:47:38,960
about
 

6589
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:40,310
about
it's like

6590
01:47:40,310 --> 01:47:40,320
it's like
 

6591
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:43,910
it's like
there is limits to your ability

6592
01:47:43,910 --> 01:47:43,920
there is limits to your ability
 

6593
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:46,550
there is limits to your ability
to construct experiments i agree but i'm

6594
01:47:46,550 --> 01:47:46,560
to construct experiments i agree but i'm
 

6595
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,390
to construct experiments i agree but i'm
i'm i was trying to be facetious and i'm

6596
01:47:48,390 --> 01:47:48,400
i'm i was trying to be facetious and i'm
 

6597
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:50,870
i'm i was trying to be facetious and i'm
trying to make a point i think that if

6598
01:47:50,870 --> 01:47:50,880
trying to make a point i think that if
 

6599
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:54,390
trying to make a point i think that if
you if there is a

6600
01:47:54,390 --> 01:47:54,400

 

6601
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:56,470

causal bottleneck

6602
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:56,480
causal bottleneck
 

6603
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:57,990
causal bottleneck
through which information can't

6604
01:47:57,990 --> 01:47:58,000
through which information can't
 

6605
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,990
through which information can't
propagate in principle

6606
01:47:59,990 --> 01:48:00,000
propagate in principle
 

6607
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,830
propagate in principle
then it's very hard

6608
01:48:01,830 --> 01:48:01,840
then it's very hard
 

6609
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:04,149
then it's very hard
to ask to think of an experiment even in

6610
01:48:04,149 --> 01:48:04,159
to ask to think of an experiment even in
 

6611
01:48:04,159 --> 01:48:06,149
to ask to think of an experiment even in
principle even one that's beyond my my

6612
01:48:06,149 --> 01:48:06,159
principle even one that's beyond my my
 

6613
01:48:06,159 --> 01:48:07,430
principle even one that's beyond my my
mediocre

6614
01:48:07,430 --> 01:48:07,440
mediocre
 

6615
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:09,750
mediocre
intellect right which is fine i'm happy

6616
01:48:09,750 --> 01:48:09,760
intellect right which is fine i'm happy
 

6617
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:11,669
intellect right which is fine i'm happy
to accept that but this is one of the

6618
01:48:11,669 --> 01:48:11,679
to accept that but this is one of the
 

6619
01:48:11,679 --> 01:48:13,109
to accept that but this is one of the
things i actually do think there was

6620
01:48:13,109 --> 01:48:13,119
things i actually do think there was
 

6621
01:48:13,119 --> 01:48:14,870
things i actually do think there was
something before the big bang because

6622
01:48:14,870 --> 01:48:14,880
something before the big bang because
 

6623
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:17,189
something before the big bang because
i'm i would say that i think the big

6624
01:48:17,189 --> 01:48:17,199
i'm i would say that i think the big
 

6625
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:19,430
i'm i would say that i think the big
bang just couldn't occur and create time

6626
01:48:19,430 --> 01:48:19,440
bang just couldn't occur and create time
 

6627
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:21,109
bang just couldn't occur and create time
time created the big bang

6628
01:48:21,109 --> 01:48:21,119
time created the big bang
 

6629
01:48:21,119 --> 01:48:22,870
time created the big bang
but uh there was time before the big

6630
01:48:22,870 --> 01:48:22,880
but uh there was time before the big
 

6631
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:24,950
but uh there was time before the big
bang yeah there was no space but those

6632
01:48:24,950 --> 01:48:24,960
bang yeah there was no space but those
 

6633
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,629
bang yeah there was no space but those
times yeah

6634
01:48:26,629 --> 01:48:26,639
times yeah
 

6635
01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:27,510
times yeah
yeah

6636
01:48:27,510 --> 01:48:27,520
yeah
 

6637
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:29,510
yeah
but i mean i'm just making that stuff up

6638
01:48:29,510 --> 01:48:29,520
but i mean i'm just making that stuff up
 

6639
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:30,870
but i mean i'm just making that stuff up
just to make all the physicists happy

6640
01:48:30,870 --> 01:48:30,880
just to make all the physicists happy
 

6641
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:31,990
just to make all the physicists happy
but i think it's

6642
01:48:31,990 --> 01:48:32,000
but i think it's
 

6643
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,350
but i think it's
dad would you think that would make them

6644
01:48:33,350 --> 01:48:33,360
dad would you think that would make them
 

6645
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:35,189
dad would you think that would make them
happy because they would be quite upset

6646
01:48:35,189 --> 01:48:35,199
happy because they would be quite upset
 

6647
01:48:35,199 --> 01:48:37,030
happy because they would be quite upset
actually and why would they be upset

6648
01:48:37,030 --> 01:48:37,040
actually and why would they be upset
 

6649
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:39,109
actually and why would they be upset
because they would say that

6650
01:48:39,109 --> 01:48:39,119
because they would say that
 

6651
01:48:39,119 --> 01:48:42,070
because they would say that
like time can't exist before yeah i mean

6652
01:48:42,070 --> 01:48:42,080
like time can't exist before yeah i mean
 

6653
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:43,990
like time can't exist before yeah i mean
this goes back to an argument that you

6654
01:48:43,990 --> 01:48:44,000
this goes back to an argument that you
 

6655
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,070
this goes back to an argument that you
might not want to have the argument here

6656
01:48:46,070 --> 01:48:46,080
might not want to have the argument here
 

6657
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:48,390
might not want to have the argument here
i i was talking to sarah earlier today

6658
01:48:48,390 --> 01:48:48,400
i i was talking to sarah earlier today
 

6659
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:49,910
i i was talking to sarah earlier today
about an argument we had about time a

6660
01:48:49,910 --> 01:48:49,920
about an argument we had about time a
 

6661
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:51,830
about an argument we had about time a
long time ago

6662
01:48:51,830 --> 01:48:51,840
long time ago
 

6663
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:54,470
long time ago
time and time and what i would it's like

6664
01:48:54,470 --> 01:48:54,480
time and time and what i would it's like
 

6665
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:56,149
time and time and what i would it's like
i think there is this thing called time

6666
01:48:56,149 --> 01:48:56,159
i think there is this thing called time
 

6667
01:48:56,159 --> 01:48:57,750
i think there is this thing called time
or state creation the universe is

6668
01:48:57,750 --> 01:48:57,760
or state creation the universe is
 

6669
01:48:57,760 --> 01:48:59,830
or state creation the universe is
creating states and it's outside of

6670
01:48:59,830 --> 01:48:59,840
creating states and it's outside of
 

6671
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:00,870
creating states and it's outside of
space

6672
01:49:00,870 --> 01:49:00,880
space
 

6673
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:02,870
space
but they create space so what i mean is

6674
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:02,880
but they create space so what i mean is
 

6675
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:04,229
but they create space so what i mean is
you can imagine there are states being

6676
01:49:04,229 --> 01:49:04,239
you can imagine there are states being
 

6677
01:49:04,239 --> 01:49:06,550
you can imagine there are states being
created all the time and there is this

6678
01:49:06,550 --> 01:49:06,560
created all the time and there is this
 

6679
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:08,229
created all the time and there is this
thing called time

6680
01:49:08,229 --> 01:49:08,239
thing called time
 

6681
01:49:08,239 --> 01:49:10,229
thing called time
time is a clock which you can use to

6682
01:49:10,229 --> 01:49:10,239
time is a clock which you can use to
 

6683
01:49:10,239 --> 01:49:12,470
time is a clock which you can use to
measure when things happen

6684
01:49:12,470 --> 01:49:12,480
measure when things happen
 

6685
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:14,470
measure when things happen
but that doesn't mean because you can't

6686
01:49:14,470 --> 01:49:14,480
but that doesn't mean because you can't
 

6687
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:15,830
but that doesn't mean because you can't
measure something that states aren't

6688
01:49:15,830 --> 01:49:15,840
measure something that states aren't
 

6689
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:17,109
measure something that states aren't
being created

6690
01:49:17,109 --> 01:49:17,119
being created
 

6691
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:21,030
being created
and so you might locally refer to

6692
01:49:21,030 --> 01:49:21,040
and so you might locally refer to
 

6693
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:23,830
and so you might locally refer to
the big bang and the bing bang occurred

6694
01:49:23,830 --> 01:49:23,840
the big bang and the bing bang occurred
 

6695
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:25,350
the big bang and the bing bang occurred
at some point

6696
01:49:25,350 --> 01:49:25,360
at some point
 

6697
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:27,350
at some point
in when those states were there

6698
01:49:27,350 --> 01:49:27,360
in when those states were there
 

6699
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:28,709
in when those states were there
probably there had to be enough states

6700
01:49:28,709 --> 01:49:28,719
probably there had to be enough states
 

6701
01:49:28,719 --> 01:49:30,629
probably there had to be enough states
for the big bang to occur

6702
01:49:30,629 --> 01:49:30,639
for the big bang to occur
 

6703
01:49:30,639 --> 01:49:32,310
for the big bang to occur
um and then

6704
01:49:32,310 --> 01:49:32,320
um and then
 

6705
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:34,229
um and then
but i i i think that there is something

6706
01:49:34,229 --> 01:49:34,239
but i i i think that there is something
 

6707
01:49:34,239 --> 01:49:35,910
but i i i think that there is something
wrong with our conception of how the

6708
01:49:35,910 --> 01:49:35,920
wrong with our conception of how the
 

6709
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:38,390
wrong with our conception of how the
universe was created in the big bang um

6710
01:49:38,390 --> 01:49:38,400
universe was created in the big bang um
 

6711
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:40,709
universe was created in the big bang um
because we don't really get time and

6712
01:49:40,709 --> 01:49:40,719
because we don't really get time and
 

6713
01:49:40,719 --> 01:49:42,950
because we don't really get time and
because again you know

6714
01:49:42,950 --> 01:49:42,960
because again you know
 

6715
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:44,229
because again you know
i don't want to become boring and sound

6716
01:49:44,229 --> 01:49:44,239
i don't want to become boring and sound
 

6717
01:49:44,239 --> 01:49:46,870
i don't want to become boring and sound
like a broken record but but um

6718
01:49:46,870 --> 01:49:46,880
like a broken record but but um
 

6719
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:48,870
like a broken record but but um
time is a real thing

6720
01:49:48,870 --> 01:49:48,880
time is a real thing
 

6721
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:50,070
time is a real thing
and until

6722
01:49:50,070 --> 01:49:50,080
and until
 

6723
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:52,629
and until
i can really explain that more elegantly

6724
01:49:52,629 --> 01:49:52,639
i can really explain that more elegantly
 

6725
01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:54,709
i can really explain that more elegantly
i'm just going to get into more trouble

6726
01:49:54,709 --> 01:49:54,719
i'm just going to get into more trouble
 

6727
01:49:54,719 --> 01:49:56,629
i'm just going to get into more trouble
we're going to talk about time because

6728
01:49:56,629 --> 01:49:56,639
we're going to talk about time because
 

6729
01:49:56,639 --> 01:49:58,870
we're going to talk about time because
uh time is useful measuring device for

6730
01:49:58,870 --> 01:49:58,880
uh time is useful measuring device for
 

6731
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:01,189
uh time is useful measuring device for
experiments but also time is as an idea

6732
01:50:01,189 --> 01:50:01,199
experiments but also time is as an idea
 

6733
01:50:01,199 --> 01:50:03,270
experiments but also time is as an idea
all that okay but let me first ask sarah

6734
01:50:03,270 --> 01:50:03,280
all that okay but let me first ask sarah
 

6735
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:05,270
all that okay but let me first ask sarah
is like what what do you think

6736
01:50:05,270 --> 01:50:05,280
is like what what do you think
 

6737
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:06,790
is like what what do you think
is it a useful question to ask what

6738
01:50:06,790 --> 01:50:06,800
is it a useful question to ask what
 

6739
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:07,750
is it a useful question to ask what
happened

6740
01:50:07,750 --> 01:50:07,760
happened
 

6741
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:09,510
happened
before the big bang is a useful question

6742
01:50:09,510 --> 01:50:09,520
before the big bang is a useful question
 

6743
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:11,589
before the big bang is a useful question
ask what's outside

6744
01:50:11,589 --> 01:50:11,599
ask what's outside
 

6745
01:50:11,599 --> 01:50:14,870
ask what's outside
the universe

6746
01:50:14,870 --> 01:50:14,880

 

6747
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:16,790

so i would think about it as

6748
01:50:16,790 --> 01:50:16,800
so i would think about it as
 

6749
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:18,550
so i would think about it as
the big bang is an event that we

6750
01:50:18,550 --> 01:50:18,560
the big bang is an event that we
 

6751
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:20,790
the big bang is an event that we
reconstructed as probably happening in

6752
01:50:20,790 --> 01:50:20,800
reconstructed as probably happening in
 

6753
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:22,229
reconstructed as probably happening in
the past of our universe based on

6754
01:50:22,229 --> 01:50:22,239
the past of our universe based on
 

6755
01:50:22,239 --> 01:50:24,629
the past of our universe based on
current observational data and so the

6756
01:50:24,629 --> 01:50:24,639
current observational data and so the
 

6757
01:50:24,639 --> 01:50:28,070
current observational data and so the
way i like to think about it is

6758
01:50:28,070 --> 01:50:28,080
way i like to think about it is
 

6759
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:29,910
way i like to think about it is
we exist locally

6760
01:50:29,910 --> 01:50:29,920
we exist locally
 

6761
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:32,310
we exist locally
in something called the universe

6762
01:50:32,310 --> 01:50:32,320
in something called the universe
 

6763
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:34,790
in something called the universe
um so and and going back to like the

6764
01:50:34,790 --> 01:50:34,800
um so and and going back to like the
 

6765
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:37,109
um so and and going back to like the
physics of existence we exist locally in

6766
01:50:37,109 --> 01:50:37,119
physics of existence we exist locally in
 

6767
01:50:37,119 --> 01:50:39,030
physics of existence we exist locally in
the space of all things that could exist

6768
01:50:39,030 --> 01:50:39,040
the space of all things that could exist
 

6769
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:41,430
the space of all things that could exist
and we can infer certain properties of

6770
01:50:41,430 --> 01:50:41,440
and we can infer certain properties of
 

6771
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:43,430
and we can infer certain properties of
the structure of where we exist locally

6772
01:50:43,430 --> 01:50:43,440
the structure of where we exist locally
 

6773
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:44,629
the structure of where we exist locally
and one of the properties that we've

6774
01:50:44,629 --> 01:50:44,639
and one of the properties that we've
 

6775
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:48,390
and one of the properties that we've
inferred in the past is that there is

6776
01:50:48,390 --> 01:50:48,400
inferred in the past is that there is
 

6777
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:49,510
inferred in the past is that there is
a

6778
01:50:49,510 --> 01:50:49,520
a
 

6779
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:51,109
a
thing we call the big bang there's some

6780
01:50:51,109 --> 01:50:51,119
thing we call the big bang there's some
 

6781
01:50:51,119 --> 01:50:52,950
thing we call the big bang there's some
signatures of our local environment that

6782
01:50:52,950 --> 01:50:52,960
signatures of our local environment that
 

6783
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:55,669
signatures of our local environment that
indicate that there was a very um low

6784
01:50:55,669 --> 01:50:55,679
indicate that there was a very um low
 

6785
01:50:55,679 --> 01:50:57,030
indicate that there was a very um low
information

6786
01:50:57,030 --> 01:50:57,040
information
 

6787
01:50:57,040 --> 01:50:58,149
information
uh

6788
01:50:58,149 --> 01:50:58,159
uh
 

6789
01:50:58,159 --> 01:51:00,149
uh
event that started our universe i think

6790
01:51:00,149 --> 01:51:00,159
event that started our universe i think
 

6791
01:51:00,159 --> 01:51:02,870
event that started our universe i think
that's actually just an artifact of

6792
01:51:02,870 --> 01:51:02,880
that's actually just an artifact of
 

6793
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:05,189
that's actually just an artifact of
the structure of the assembly space that

6794
01:51:05,189 --> 01:51:05,199
the structure of the assembly space that
 

6795
01:51:05,199 --> 01:51:06,950
the structure of the assembly space that
when you

6796
01:51:06,950 --> 01:51:06,960
when you
 

6797
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:07,990
when you
when you

6798
01:51:07,990 --> 01:51:08,000
when you
 

6799
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,430
when you
start losing all the memory in the

6800
01:51:09,430 --> 01:51:09,440
start losing all the memory in the
 

6801
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:11,669
start losing all the memory in the
objects it it looks like what we call a

6802
01:51:11,669 --> 01:51:11,679
objects it it looks like what we call a
 

6803
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:12,709
objects it it looks like what we call a
big bang

6804
01:51:12,709 --> 01:51:12,719
big bang
 

6805
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:14,550
big bang
um so i think it makes sense to talk

6806
01:51:14,550 --> 01:51:14,560
um so i think it makes sense to talk
 

6807
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:17,109
um so i think it makes sense to talk
about where you are locally i think it

6808
01:51:17,109 --> 01:51:17,119
about where you are locally i think it
 

6809
01:51:17,119 --> 01:51:18,870
about where you are locally i think it
makes sense to talk about counterfactual

6810
01:51:18,870 --> 01:51:18,880
makes sense to talk about counterfactual
 

6811
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:21,109
makes sense to talk about counterfactual
possibilities what could exist outside

6812
01:51:21,109 --> 01:51:21,119
possibilities what could exist outside
 

6813
01:51:21,119 --> 01:51:22,950
possibilities what could exist outside
the universe in the sense that they

6814
01:51:22,950 --> 01:51:22,960
the universe in the sense that they
 

6815
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:24,709
the universe in the sense that they
become part of our reasoning and

6816
01:51:24,709 --> 01:51:24,719
become part of our reasoning and
 

6817
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:26,310
become part of our reasoning and
therefore part of our causal chain of

6818
01:51:26,310 --> 01:51:26,320
therefore part of our causal chain of
 

6819
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:27,910
therefore part of our causal chain of
things that we can do

6820
01:51:27,910 --> 01:51:27,920
things that we can do
 

6821
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:30,229
things that we can do
um so like the multiverse

6822
01:51:30,229 --> 01:51:30,239
um so like the multiverse
 

6823
01:51:30,239 --> 01:51:32,470
um so like the multiverse
in my mind exists but it doesn't exist

6824
01:51:32,470 --> 01:51:32,480
in my mind exists but it doesn't exist
 

6825
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:34,550
in my mind exists but it doesn't exist
as a multiverse of possible universes it

6826
01:51:34,550 --> 01:51:34,560
as a multiverse of possible universes it
 

6827
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:36,229
as a multiverse of possible universes it
exists as an idea in our minds that

6828
01:51:36,229 --> 01:51:36,239
exists as an idea in our minds that
 

6829
01:51:36,239 --> 01:51:37,669
exists as an idea in our minds that
allows us to reason about how physics

6830
01:51:37,669 --> 01:51:37,679
allows us to reason about how physics
 

6831
01:51:37,679 --> 01:51:39,430
allows us to reason about how physics
works and then to do physics differently

6832
01:51:39,430 --> 01:51:39,440
works and then to do physics differently
 

6833
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:41,350
works and then to do physics differently
because we reason about it that way

6834
01:51:41,350 --> 01:51:41,360
because we reason about it that way
 

6835
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:46,149
because we reason about it that way
um so i always like to re-center it on

6836
01:51:46,149 --> 01:51:46,159
um so i always like to re-center it on
 

6837
01:51:46,159 --> 01:51:48,070
um so i always like to re-center it on
things exist but they don't always exist

6838
01:51:48,070 --> 01:51:48,080
things exist but they don't always exist
 

6839
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:50,070
things exist but they don't always exist
like we think they exist

6840
01:51:50,070 --> 01:51:50,080
like we think they exist
 

6841
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:51,669
like we think they exist
um so when we're thinking about things

6842
01:51:51,669 --> 01:51:51,679
um so when we're thinking about things
 

6843
01:51:51,679 --> 01:51:53,589
um so when we're thinking about things
outside the universe they absolutely

6844
01:51:53,589 --> 01:51:53,599
outside the universe they absolutely
 

6845
01:51:53,599 --> 01:51:55,109
outside the universe they absolutely
exist because we're thinking about them

6846
01:51:55,109 --> 01:51:55,119
exist because we're thinking about them
 

6847
01:51:55,119 --> 01:51:57,510
exist because we're thinking about them
but they don't look like

6848
01:51:57,510 --> 01:51:57,520
but they don't look like
 

6849
01:51:57,520 --> 01:51:58,870
but they don't look like
they don't look like the projections in

6850
01:51:58,870 --> 01:51:58,880
they don't look like the projections in
 

6851
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:00,709
they don't look like the projections in
our minds they're something else

6852
01:52:00,709 --> 01:52:00,719
our minds they're something else
 

6853
01:52:00,719 --> 01:52:01,990
our minds they're something else
something you said just gave me an idea

6854
01:52:01,990 --> 01:52:02,000
something you said just gave me an idea
 

6855
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,550
something you said just gave me an idea
to go back to your question

6856
01:52:04,550 --> 01:52:04,560
to go back to your question
 

6857
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:05,990
to go back to your question
if

6858
01:52:05,990 --> 01:52:06,000
if
 

6859
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,629
if
there was court i mean some if something

6860
01:52:08,629 --> 01:52:08,639
there was court i mean some if something
 

6861
01:52:08,639 --> 01:52:10,229
there was court i mean some if something
caused the big bang if there was some

6862
01:52:10,229 --> 01:52:10,239
caused the big bang if there was some
 

6863
01:52:10,239 --> 01:52:12,310
caused the big bang if there was some
memory or some artifact of that then of

6864
01:52:12,310 --> 01:52:12,320
memory or some artifact of that then of
 

6865
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:13,750
memory or some artifact of that then of
course it's to answer your question it's

6866
01:52:13,750 --> 01:52:13,760
course it's to answer your question it's
 

6867
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:15,990
course it's to answer your question it's
worth going back to that because it that

6868
01:52:15,990 --> 01:52:16,000
worth going back to that because it that
 

6869
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,589
worth going back to that because it that
would imply there is something beyond

6870
01:52:17,589 --> 01:52:17,599
would imply there is something beyond
 

6871
01:52:17,599 --> 01:52:19,830
would imply there is something beyond
that barrier that filter yeah and that's

6872
01:52:19,830 --> 01:52:19,840
that barrier that filter yeah and that's
 

6873
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:21,589
that barrier that filter yeah and that's
what you were saying i guess right

6874
01:52:21,589 --> 01:52:21,599
what you were saying i guess right
 

6875
01:52:21,599 --> 01:52:23,350
what you were saying i guess right
i'm agnostic to what exists outside the

6876
01:52:23,350 --> 01:52:23,360
i'm agnostic to what exists outside the
 

6877
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:24,870
i'm agnostic to what exists outside the
universe i just don't think that like i

6878
01:52:24,870 --> 01:52:24,880
universe i just don't think that like i
 

6879
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:26,310
universe i just don't think that like i
think the most interesting things for us

6880
01:52:26,310 --> 01:52:26,320
think the most interesting things for us
 

6881
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:28,550
think the most interesting things for us
to be doing are finding explanations

6882
01:52:28,550 --> 01:52:28,560
to be doing are finding explanations
 

6883
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:31,830
to be doing are finding explanations
that allow us to do more like like that

6884
01:52:31,830 --> 01:52:31,840
that allow us to do more like like that
 

6885
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:34,629
that allow us to do more like like that
optimism so i tend to draw the boundary

6886
01:52:34,629 --> 01:52:34,639
optimism so i tend to draw the boundary
 

6887
01:52:34,639 --> 01:52:36,310
optimism so i tend to draw the boundary
on questions i ask as being scientific

6888
01:52:36,310 --> 01:52:36,320
on questions i ask as being scientific
 

6889
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:38,070
on questions i ask as being scientific
ones because i find

6890
01:52:38,070 --> 01:52:38,080
ones because i find
 

6891
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:38,870
ones because i find
that

6892
01:52:38,870 --> 01:52:38,880
that
 

6893
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:40,390
that
that's where the most creative potential

6894
01:52:40,390 --> 01:52:40,400
that's where the most creative potential
 

6895
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:42,629
that's where the most creative potential
is to impact the future trajectory of

6896
01:52:42,629 --> 01:52:42,639
is to impact the future trajectory of
 

6897
01:52:42,639 --> 01:52:44,070
is to impact the future trajectory of
what we're doing on this planet the

6898
01:52:44,070 --> 01:52:44,080
what we're doing on this planet the
 

6899
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:45,910
what we're doing on this planet the
interesting thing about the big bang is

6900
01:52:45,910 --> 01:52:45,920
interesting thing about the big bang is
 

6901
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:47,669
interesting thing about the big bang is
basically from our

6902
01:52:47,669 --> 01:52:47,679
basically from our
 

6903
01:52:47,679 --> 01:52:49,270
basically from our
current perspective of what we're able

6904
01:52:49,270 --> 01:52:49,280
current perspective of what we're able
 

6905
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:50,709
current perspective of what we're able
to detect

6906
01:52:50,709 --> 01:52:50,719
to detect
 

6907
01:52:50,719 --> 01:52:52,870
to detect
it's the time when things were forgotten

6908
01:52:52,870 --> 01:52:52,880
it's the time when things were forgotten
 

6909
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:53,990
it's the time when things were forgotten
yes

6910
01:52:53,990 --> 01:52:54,000
yes
 

6911
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,229
yes
it's the time the reset

6912
01:52:56,229 --> 01:52:56,239
it's the time the reset
 

6913
01:52:56,239 --> 01:52:58,390
it's the time the reset
from our limited perspective

6914
01:52:58,390 --> 01:52:58,400
from our limited perspective
 

6915
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:00,229
from our limited perspective
and so the question is is it useful to

6916
01:53:00,229 --> 01:53:00,239
and so the question is is it useful to
 

6917
01:53:00,239 --> 01:53:01,270
and so the question is is it useful to
ever

6918
01:53:01,270 --> 01:53:01,280
ever
 

6919
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:04,390
ever
study the thing that was forgotten

6920
01:53:04,390 --> 01:53:04,400
study the thing that was forgotten
 

6921
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:06,950
study the thing that was forgotten
um or should we focus just on the on the

6922
01:53:06,950 --> 01:53:06,960
um or should we focus just on the on the
 

6923
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:08,390
um or should we focus just on the on the
memories that are still there well the

6924
01:53:08,390 --> 01:53:08,400
memories that are still there well the
 

6925
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:09,350
memories that are still there well the
point i was trying to make with

6926
01:53:09,350 --> 01:53:09,360
point i was trying to make with
 

6927
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:11,350
point i was trying to make with
experiment is i was trying to say both

6928
01:53:11,350 --> 01:53:11,360
experiment is i was trying to say both
 

6929
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:13,109
experiment is i was trying to say both
things and i think perhaps yes from the

6930
01:53:13,109 --> 01:53:13,119
things and i think perhaps yes from the
 

6931
01:53:13,119 --> 01:53:14,629
things and i think perhaps yes from the
pot following point of view if you could

6932
01:53:14,629 --> 01:53:14,639
pot following point of view if you could
 

6933
01:53:14,639 --> 01:53:17,430
pot following point of view if you could
then imagine what was forgotten

6934
01:53:17,430 --> 01:53:17,440
then imagine what was forgotten
 

6935
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:19,669
then imagine what was forgotten
and then work forwards you will have

6936
01:53:19,669 --> 01:53:19,679
and then work forwards you will have
 

6937
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:21,189
and then work forwards you will have
different consequences so then it

6938
01:53:21,189 --> 01:53:21,199
different consequences so then it
 

6939
01:53:21,199 --> 01:53:22,550
different consequences so then it
becomes testable

6940
01:53:22,550 --> 01:53:22,560
becomes testable
 

6941
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:24,629
becomes testable
so i'm as long as we can find tests and

6942
01:53:24,629 --> 01:53:24,639
so i'm as long as we can find tests and
 

6943
01:53:24,639 --> 01:53:26,229
so i'm as long as we can find tests and
it's definitely worth thinking about

6944
01:53:26,229 --> 01:53:26,239
it's definitely worth thinking about
 

6945
01:53:26,239 --> 01:53:28,229
it's definitely worth thinking about
what i don't like is when physicists say

6946
01:53:28,229 --> 01:53:28,239
what i don't like is when physicists say
 

6947
01:53:28,239 --> 01:53:29,669
what i don't like is when physicists say
what happened before the big bang and

6948
01:53:29,669 --> 01:53:29,679
what happened before the big bang and
 

6949
01:53:29,679 --> 01:53:31,750
what happened before the big bang and
before before before without giving me

6950
01:53:31,750 --> 01:53:31,760
before before before without giving me
 

6951
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:33,430
before before before without giving me
any credible

6952
01:53:33,430 --> 01:53:33,440
any credible
 

6953
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:36,470
any credible
um conjecture about what we would

6954
01:53:36,470 --> 01:53:36,480
um conjecture about what we would
 

6955
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:38,070
um conjecture about what we would
what how would we know the difference

6956
01:53:38,070 --> 01:53:38,080
what how would we know the difference
 

6957
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:39,270
what how would we know the difference
but the way you've framed it is quite

6958
01:53:39,270 --> 01:53:39,280
but the way you've framed it is quite
 

6959
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:41,510
but the way you've framed it is quite
nice i like that it's like what

6960
01:53:41,510 --> 01:53:41,520
nice i like that it's like what
 

6961
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:43,430
nice i like that it's like what
what have we forgotten

6962
01:53:43,430 --> 01:53:43,440
what have we forgotten
 

6963
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:45,589
what have we forgotten
is there room for god

6964
01:53:45,589 --> 01:53:45,599
is there room for god
 

6965
01:53:45,599 --> 01:53:47,669
is there room for god
in assembly theory

6966
01:53:47,669 --> 01:53:47,679
in assembly theory
 

6967
01:53:47,679 --> 01:53:49,430
in assembly theory
who's god

6968
01:53:49,430 --> 01:53:49,440
who's god
 

6969
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:51,189
who's god
i like arguments for a necessary being

6970
01:53:51,189 --> 01:53:51,199
i like arguments for a necessary being
 

6971
01:53:51,199 --> 01:53:52,550
i like arguments for a necessary being
better than god

6972
01:53:52,550 --> 01:53:52,560
better than god
 

6973
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,790
better than god
well i think i said it earlier

6974
01:53:54,790 --> 01:53:54,800
well i think i said it earlier
 

6975
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:58,229
well i think i said it earlier
like something that has to exist

6976
01:53:58,229 --> 01:53:58,239

 

6977
01:53:58,239 --> 01:53:59,990

oh so you like i mean you like the

6978
01:53:59,990 --> 01:54:00,000
oh so you like i mean you like the
 

6979
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,870
oh so you like i mean you like the
shortest path like does god need no no i

6980
01:54:02,870 --> 01:54:02,880
shortest path like does god need no no i
 

6981
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:04,629
shortest path like does god need no no i
i mean well you can go back to like

6982
01:54:04,629 --> 01:54:04,639
i mean well you can go back to like
 

6983
01:54:04,639 --> 01:54:07,589
i mean well you can go back to like
thomas aquinas and arguments for

6984
01:54:07,589 --> 01:54:07,599
thomas aquinas and arguments for
 

6985
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:09,750
thomas aquinas and arguments for
the existence of god but i think i think

6986
01:54:09,750 --> 01:54:09,760
the existence of god but i think i think
 

6987
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:11,189
the existence of god but i think i think
most of the interesting theological

6988
01:54:11,189 --> 01:54:11,199
most of the interesting theological
 

6989
01:54:11,199 --> 01:54:13,109
most of the interesting theological
arguments are always

6990
01:54:13,109 --> 01:54:13,119
arguments are always
 

6991
01:54:13,119 --> 01:54:14,870
arguments are always
about whether something has to exist or

6992
01:54:14,870 --> 01:54:14,880
about whether something has to exist or
 

6993
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:16,950
about whether something has to exist or
there was a first thing that had exist

6994
01:54:16,950 --> 01:54:16,960
there was a first thing that had exist
 

6995
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:18,310
there was a first thing that had exist
but i think there's a lot of logical

6996
01:54:18,310 --> 01:54:18,320
but i think there's a lot of logical
 

6997
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:20,070
but i think there's a lot of logical
loopholes in those kind of organs well

6998
01:54:20,070 --> 01:54:20,080
loopholes in those kind of organs well
 

6999
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:24,070
loopholes in those kind of organs well
so god here meaning the machine

7000
01:54:24,070 --> 01:54:24,080
so god here meaning the machine
 

7001
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:25,830
so god here meaning the machine
that creates

7002
01:54:25,830 --> 01:54:25,840
that creates
 

7003
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:27,750
that creates
that generates

7004
01:54:27,750 --> 01:54:27,760
that generates
 

7005
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:29,189
that generates
the stuff

7006
01:54:29,189 --> 01:54:29,199
the stuff
 

7007
01:54:29,199 --> 01:54:30,950
the stuff
because god so what i was trying to say

7008
01:54:30,950 --> 01:54:30,960
because god so what i was trying to say
 

7009
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:32,550
because god so what i was trying to say
earlier isn't that just the universe

7010
01:54:32,550 --> 01:54:32,560
earlier isn't that just the universe
 

7011
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:35,030
earlier isn't that just the universe
yeah yeah well yeah well but i there's a

7012
01:54:35,030 --> 01:54:35,040
yeah yeah well yeah well but i there's a
 

7013
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:36,390
yeah yeah well yeah well but i there's a
difference between

7014
01:54:36,390 --> 01:54:36,400
difference between
 

7015
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:38,550
difference between
i i should i imagine like a black box

7016
01:54:38,550 --> 01:54:38,560
i i should i imagine like a black box
 

7017
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:40,310
i i should i imagine like a black box
like a machine

7018
01:54:40,310 --> 01:54:40,320
like a machine
 

7019
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:41,990
like a machine
yeah that's then i would be more

7020
01:54:41,990 --> 01:54:42,000
yeah that's then i would be more
 

7021
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,229
yeah that's then i would be more
comfortable calling that god

7022
01:54:44,229 --> 01:54:44,239
comfortable calling that god
 

7023
01:54:44,239 --> 01:54:45,589
comfortable calling that god
because it's a machine you go into a

7024
01:54:45,589 --> 01:54:45,599
because it's a machine you go into a
 

7025
01:54:45,599 --> 01:54:47,510
because it's a machine you go into a
room and there's a thing with a button

7026
01:54:47,510 --> 01:54:47,520
room and there's a thing with a button
 

7027
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:48,790
room and there's a thing with a button
yeah i don't like the great programmer

7028
01:54:48,790 --> 01:54:48,800
yeah i don't like the great programmer
 

7029
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:51,189
yeah i don't like the great programmer
in the sky version can i yeah but if

7030
01:54:51,189 --> 01:54:51,199
in the sky version can i yeah but if
 

7031
01:54:51,199 --> 01:54:53,510
in the sky version can i yeah but if
it's more kind of uh

7032
01:54:53,510 --> 01:54:53,520
it's more kind of uh
 

7033
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:55,910
it's more kind of uh
um like i don't like to think of if you

7034
01:54:55,910 --> 01:54:55,920
um like i don't like to think of if you
 

7035
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:59,750
um like i don't like to think of if you
look at a cellular automata

7036
01:54:59,750 --> 01:54:59,760

 

7037
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:02,870

if it if it's the cells and the rules

7038
01:55:02,870 --> 01:55:02,880
if it if it's the cells and the rules
 

7039
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:04,470
if it if it's the cells and the rules
that doesn't feel like god that

7040
01:55:04,470 --> 01:55:04,480
that doesn't feel like god that
 

7041
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:06,390
that doesn't feel like god that
generates a bunch of stuff but if

7042
01:55:06,390 --> 01:55:06,400
generates a bunch of stuff but if
 

7043
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:08,550
generates a bunch of stuff but if
there's a machine

7044
01:55:08,550 --> 01:55:08,560
there's a machine
 

7045
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:11,430
there's a machine
like uh that does that runs the cellular

7046
01:55:11,430 --> 01:55:11,440
like uh that does that runs the cellular
 

7047
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:13,910
like uh that does that runs the cellular
automata and set the rules then that

7048
01:55:13,910 --> 01:55:13,920
automata and set the rules then that
 

7049
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:15,669
automata and set the rules then that
feels like god

7050
01:55:15,669 --> 01:55:15,679
feels like god
 

7051
01:55:15,679 --> 01:55:18,310
feels like god
that the other sort of in terms of

7052
01:55:18,310 --> 01:55:18,320
that the other sort of in terms of
 

7053
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:20,070
that the other sort of in terms of
terminology so i wonder if there's like

7054
01:55:20,070 --> 01:55:20,080
terminology so i wonder if there's like
 

7055
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:22,629
terminology so i wonder if there's like
a machine that's required to generate

7056
01:55:22,629 --> 01:55:22,639
a machine that's required to generate
 

7057
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:24,149
a machine that's required to generate
this universe that's very sort of

7058
01:55:24,149 --> 01:55:24,159
this universe that's very sort of
 

7059
01:55:24,159 --> 01:55:26,629
this universe that's very sort of
important for running this in the lab

7060
01:55:26,629 --> 01:55:26,639
important for running this in the lab
 

7061
01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:28,950
important for running this in the lab
so as i said earlier i think i said this

7062
01:55:28,950 --> 01:55:28,960
so as i said earlier i think i said this
 

7063
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:30,629
so as i said earlier i think i said this
earlier that i can't remember the phrase

7064
01:55:30,629 --> 01:55:30,639
earlier that i can't remember the phrase
 

7065
01:55:30,639 --> 01:55:33,189
earlier that i can't remember the phrase
but something like i mean does god exist

7066
01:55:33,189 --> 01:55:33,199
but something like i mean does god exist
 

7067
01:55:33,199 --> 01:55:35,030
but something like i mean does god exist
in our universe yes

7068
01:55:35,030 --> 01:55:35,040
in our universe yes
 

7069
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:37,189
in our universe yes
where does god exist exhaust god at

7070
01:55:37,189 --> 01:55:37,199
where does god exist exhaust god at
 

7071
01:55:37,199 --> 01:55:39,589
where does god exist exhaust god at
least exists in the abstraction in my in

7072
01:55:39,589 --> 01:55:39,599
least exists in the abstraction in my in
 

7073
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:40,870
least exists in the abstraction in my in
our minds

7074
01:55:40,870 --> 01:55:40,880
our minds
 

7075
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:42,709
our minds
particularly people who have who have

7076
01:55:42,709 --> 01:55:42,719
particularly people who have who have
 

7077
01:55:42,719 --> 01:55:45,109
particularly people who have who have
religious faith they believe in but

7078
01:55:45,109 --> 01:55:45,119
religious faith they believe in but
 

7079
01:55:45,119 --> 01:55:46,629
religious faith they believe in but
let's then take your but you're talking

7080
01:55:46,629 --> 01:55:46,639
let's then take your but you're talking
 

7081
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:48,229
let's then take your but you're talking
a little bit more about generics say

7082
01:55:48,229 --> 01:55:48,239
a little bit more about generics say
 

7083
01:55:48,239 --> 01:55:49,030
a little bit more about generics say
well

7084
01:55:49,030 --> 01:55:49,040
well
 

7085
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:51,030
well
is there a mechanism beyond the universe

7086
01:55:51,030 --> 01:55:51,040
is there a mechanism beyond the universe
 

7087
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:53,510
is there a mechanism beyond the universe
you're calling god i would say god

7088
01:55:53,510 --> 01:55:53,520
you're calling god i would say god
 

7089
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:55,830
you're calling god i would say god
did not exist at the beginning

7090
01:55:55,830 --> 01:55:55,840
did not exist at the beginning
 

7091
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:59,589
did not exist at the beginning
but he or she does now

7092
01:55:59,589 --> 01:55:59,599
but he or she does now
 

7093
01:55:59,599 --> 01:56:00,550
but he or she does now
because i'm saying the mix well you

7094
01:56:00,550 --> 01:56:00,560
because i'm saying the mix well you
 

7095
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:01,589
because i'm saying the mix well you
don't know if

7096
01:56:01,589 --> 01:56:01,599
don't know if
 

7097
01:56:01,599 --> 01:56:03,350
don't know if
he didn't exist in the beginning

7098
01:56:03,350 --> 01:56:03,360
he didn't exist in the beginning
 

7099
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:04,629
he didn't exist in the beginning
so like uh

7100
01:56:04,629 --> 01:56:04,639
so like uh
 

7101
01:56:04,639 --> 01:56:07,750
so like uh
this could be us in our minds trying to

7102
01:56:07,750 --> 01:56:07,760
this could be us in our minds trying to
 

7103
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:08,950
this could be us in our minds trying to
like just

7104
01:56:08,950 --> 01:56:08,960
like just
 

7105
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:10,790
like just
listening to gravitational waves

7106
01:56:10,790 --> 01:56:10,800
listening to gravitational waves
 

7107
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:12,390
listening to gravitational waves
detecting gravitational waves it's the

7108
01:56:12,390 --> 01:56:12,400
detecting gravitational waves it's the
 

7109
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:14,550
detecting gravitational waves it's the
same thing us trying to

7110
01:56:14,550 --> 01:56:14,560
same thing us trying to
 

7111
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:17,189
same thing us trying to
uh go back further and further into our

7112
01:56:17,189 --> 01:56:17,199
uh go back further and further into our
 

7113
01:56:17,199 --> 01:56:19,189
uh go back further and further into our
memories to try to understand the

7114
01:56:19,189 --> 01:56:19,199
memories to try to understand the
 

7115
01:56:19,199 --> 01:56:21,910
memories to try to understand the
machines that make up

7116
01:56:21,910 --> 01:56:21,920
machines that make up
 

7117
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:23,990
machines that make up
that make up us and so it's possible

7118
01:56:23,990 --> 01:56:24,000
that make up us and so it's possible
 

7119
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,350
that make up us and so it's possible
that we're trying to

7120
01:56:25,350 --> 01:56:25,360
that we're trying to
 

7121
01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:26,470
that we're trying to
um

7122
01:56:26,470 --> 01:56:26,480
um
 

7123
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:29,189
um
grasp that possible kind of

7124
01:56:29,189 --> 01:56:29,199
grasp that possible kind of
 

7125
01:56:29,199 --> 01:56:31,669
grasp that possible kind of
what kind of machines could create

7126
01:56:31,669 --> 01:56:31,679
what kind of machines could create
 

7127
01:56:31,679 --> 01:56:33,830
what kind of machines could create
uh there's a there's always a tweet

7128
01:56:33,830 --> 01:56:33,840
uh there's a there's always a tweet
 

7129
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:36,550
uh there's a there's always a tweet
there's always a tweet uh if the

7130
01:56:36,550 --> 01:56:36,560
there's always a tweet uh if the
 

7131
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:38,310
there's always a tweet uh if the
universe is a computer then god must

7132
01:56:38,310 --> 01:56:38,320
universe is a computer then god must
 

7133
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:40,149
universe is a computer then god must
have built it because computers need

7134
01:56:40,149 --> 01:56:40,159
have built it because computers need
 

7135
01:56:40,159 --> 01:56:43,030
have built it because computers need
creators there you go

7136
01:56:43,030 --> 01:56:43,040
creators there you go
 

7137
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:46,390
creators there you go
and then uh yoshibok replied

7138
01:56:46,390 --> 01:56:46,400
and then uh yoshibok replied
 

7139
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:48,149
and then uh yoshibok replied
since there's something rather than

7140
01:56:48,149 --> 01:56:48,159
since there's something rather than
 

7141
01:56:48,159 --> 01:56:52,229
since there's something rather than
nothing perhaps existence is the default

7142
01:56:52,229 --> 01:56:52,239
nothing perhaps existence is the default
 

7143
01:56:52,239 --> 01:56:54,950
nothing perhaps existence is the default
if existence is the default then many

7144
01:56:54,950 --> 01:56:54,960
if existence is the default then many
 

7145
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:57,589
if existence is the default then many
computers exist creator gods are

7146
01:56:57,589 --> 01:56:57,599
computers exist creator gods are
 

7147
01:56:57,599 --> 01:56:59,669
computers exist creator gods are
necessary computers unnecessarily

7148
01:56:59,669 --> 01:56:59,679
necessary computers unnecessarily
 

7149
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:01,910
necessary computers unnecessarily
computers too i'm very confused by that

7150
01:57:01,910 --> 01:57:01,920
computers too i'm very confused by that
 

7151
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:03,350
computers too i'm very confused by that
but that's an interesting idea that

7152
01:57:03,350 --> 01:57:03,360
but that's an interesting idea that
 

7153
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:04,950
but that's an interesting idea that
existence is a default versus

7154
01:57:04,950 --> 01:57:04,960
existence is a default versus
 

7155
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:06,950
existence is a default versus
non-existence i agree with that but the

7156
01:57:06,950 --> 01:57:06,960
non-existence i agree with that but the
 

7157
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:09,669
non-existence i agree with that but the
rest is the response perhaps this

7158
01:57:09,669 --> 01:57:09,679
rest is the response perhaps this
 

7159
01:57:09,679 --> 01:57:12,470
rest is the response perhaps this
reasoning is incomplete that's

7160
01:57:12,470 --> 01:57:12,480
reasoning is incomplete that's
 

7161
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:14,229
reasoning is incomplete that's
that's how scientists talk trash each

7162
01:57:14,229 --> 01:57:14,239
that's how scientists talk trash each
 

7163
01:57:14,239 --> 01:57:16,390
that's how scientists talk trash each
other on twitter apparently uh which

7164
01:57:16,390 --> 01:57:16,400
other on twitter apparently uh which
 

7165
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:18,310
other on twitter apparently uh which
part don't you agree with

7166
01:57:18,310 --> 01:57:18,320
part don't you agree with
 

7167
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:20,470
part don't you agree with
uh when he said if existence is default

7168
01:57:20,470 --> 01:57:20,480
uh when he said if existence is default
 

7169
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:22,310
uh when he said if existence is default
then many computers exist this comes

7170
01:57:22,310 --> 01:57:22,320
then many computers exist this comes
 

7171
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:24,229
then many computers exist this comes
back to the inventor and discovery

7172
01:57:24,229 --> 01:57:24,239
back to the inventor and discovery
 

7173
01:57:24,239 --> 01:57:26,149
back to the inventor and discovery
argument

7174
01:57:26,149 --> 01:57:26,159
argument
 

7175
01:57:26,159 --> 01:57:27,669
argument
i would say the universe at the

7176
01:57:27,669 --> 01:57:27,679
i would say the universe at the
 

7177
01:57:27,679 --> 01:57:29,589
i would say the universe at the
beginning wasn't capable

7178
01:57:29,589 --> 01:57:29,599
beginning wasn't capable
 

7179
01:57:29,599 --> 01:57:31,510
beginning wasn't capable
of computation

7180
01:57:31,510 --> 01:57:31,520
of computation
 

7181
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:33,189
of computation
because there wasn't enough technology

7182
01:57:33,189 --> 01:57:33,199
because there wasn't enough technology
 

7183
01:57:33,199 --> 01:57:34,629
because there wasn't enough technology
enough states

7184
01:57:34,629 --> 01:57:34,639
enough states
 

7185
01:57:34,639 --> 01:57:36,950
enough states
so what you're saying is the mec if god

7186
01:57:36,950 --> 01:57:36,960
so what you're saying is the mec if god
 

7187
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:38,470
so what you're saying is the mec if god
is a mechanism

7188
01:57:38,470 --> 01:57:38,480
is a mechanism
 

7189
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:40,950
is a mechanism
so i might actually agree but then the

7190
01:57:40,950 --> 01:57:40,960
so i might actually agree but then the
 

7191
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:43,109
so i might actually agree but then the
thing is lots of people seem more see

7192
01:57:43,109 --> 01:57:43,119
thing is lots of people seem more see
 

7193
01:57:43,119 --> 01:57:45,109
thing is lots of people seem more see
god is more than a mechanism for me god

7194
01:57:45,109 --> 01:57:45,119
god is more than a mechanism for me god
 

7195
01:57:45,119 --> 01:57:47,109
god is more than a mechanism for me god
could be the causal graph and assembly

01:57:47,109 --> 01:57:47,119
could be the causal graph and assembly

01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:53,109
we can
even relate to each other is because we

7204
01:57:53,109 --> 01:57:53,119
even relate to each other is because we
 

7205
01:57:53,119 --> 01:57:55,669
even relate to each other is because we
have the same we share that heritage and

7206
01:57:55,669 --> 01:57:55,679
have the same we share that heritage and
 

7207
01:57:55,679 --> 01:57:57,830
have the same we share that heritage and
why we love each other or we like to see

7208
01:57:57,830 --> 01:57:57,840
why we love each other or we like to see
 

7209
01:57:57,840 --> 01:57:59,270
why we love each other or we like to see
god in each other is

7210
01:57:59,270 --> 01:57:59,280
god in each other is
 

7211
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:01,189
god in each other is
it's just

7212
01:58:01,189 --> 01:58:01,199
it's just
 

7213
01:58:01,199 --> 01:58:02,149
it's just
we

7214
01:58:02,149 --> 01:58:02,159
we
 

7215
01:58:02,159 --> 01:58:04,629
we
know we have a shared existence

7216
01:58:04,629 --> 01:58:04,639
know we have a shared existence
 

7217
01:58:04,639 --> 01:58:06,550
know we have a shared existence
so that if the god is the mechanism that

7218
01:58:06,550 --> 01:58:06,560
so that if the god is the mechanism that
 

7219
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:08,310
so that if the god is the mechanism that
created this whole thing

7220
01:58:08,310 --> 01:58:08,320
created this whole thing
 

7221
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:10,310
created this whole thing
i think a lot of people see god you know

7222
01:58:10,310 --> 01:58:10,320
i think a lot of people see god you know
 

7223
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:11,990
i think a lot of people see god you know
in a religious sense

7224
01:58:11,990 --> 01:58:12,000
in a religious sense
 

7225
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:13,109
in a religious sense
as a

7226
01:58:13,109 --> 01:58:13,119
as a
 

7227
01:58:13,119 --> 01:58:15,109
as a
as that mechanism also being able to

7228
01:58:15,109 --> 01:58:15,119
as that mechanism also being able to
 

7229
01:58:15,119 --> 01:58:17,910
as that mechanism also being able to
communicate with the objects it creates

7230
01:58:17,910 --> 01:58:17,920
communicate with the objects it creates
 

7231
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:19,750
communicate with the objects it creates
and if it's just the mechanism it won't

7232
01:58:19,750 --> 01:58:19,760
and if it's just the mechanism it won't
 

7233
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:21,750
and if it's just the mechanism it won't
be able to create with the object uh

7234
01:58:21,750 --> 01:58:21,760
be able to create with the object uh
 

7235
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:23,430
be able to create with the object uh
communicate with the objects it creates

7236
01:58:23,430 --> 01:58:23,440
communicate with the objects it creates
 

7237
01:58:23,440 --> 01:58:26,149
communicate with the objects it creates
it can only create you can't like

7238
01:58:26,149 --> 01:58:26,159
it can only create you can't like
 

7239
01:58:26,159 --> 01:58:28,070
it can only create you can't like
interact

7240
01:58:28,070 --> 01:58:28,080
interact
 

7241
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:29,910
interact
with the uh there's versions of god that

7242
01:58:29,910 --> 01:58:29,920
with the uh there's versions of god that
 

7243
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:32,070
with the uh there's versions of god that
create the universe and then left

7244
01:58:32,070 --> 01:58:32,080
create the universe and then left
 

7245
01:58:32,080 --> 01:58:33,510
create the universe and then left
you know

7246
01:58:33,510 --> 01:58:33,520
you know
 

7247
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:35,510
you know
yeah like spark for some for some

7248
01:58:35,510 --> 01:58:35,520
yeah like spark for some for some
 

7249
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:37,669
yeah like spark for some for some
religions but the first spark yeah yeah

7250
01:58:37,669 --> 01:58:37,679
religions but the first spark yeah yeah
 

7251
01:58:37,679 --> 01:58:39,990
religions but the first spark yeah yeah
but i i think i liked your analogy of

7252
01:58:39,990 --> 01:58:40,000
but i i think i liked your analogy of
 

7253
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:43,750
but i i think i liked your analogy of
the machine and the rules right but

7254
01:58:43,750 --> 01:58:43,760
the machine and the rules right but
 

7255
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:45,030
the machine and the rules right but
um

7256
01:58:45,030 --> 01:58:45,040
um
 

7257
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:47,350
um
i think part of the problem is you i

7258
01:58:47,350 --> 01:58:47,360
i think part of the problem is you i
 

7259
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:49,109
i think part of the problem is you i
mean we have this conception that we can

7260
01:58:49,109 --> 01:58:49,119
mean we have this conception that we can
 

7261
01:58:49,119 --> 01:58:50,950
mean we have this conception that we can
disentangle the rules from the physical

7262
01:58:50,950 --> 01:58:50,960
disentangle the rules from the physical
 

7263
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:52,390
disentangle the rules from the physical
substrate right and that's the whole

7264
01:58:52,390 --> 01:58:52,400
substrate right and that's the whole
 

7265
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:53,830
substrate right and that's the whole
thing about like software and hardware

7266
01:58:53,830 --> 01:58:53,840
thing about like software and hardware
 

7267
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:55,430
thing about like software and hardware
being separate or the way newton wrote

7268
01:58:55,430 --> 01:58:55,440
being separate or the way newton wrote
 

7269
01:58:55,440 --> 01:58:57,030
being separate or the way newton wrote
his laws that there was some you know

7270
01:58:57,030 --> 01:58:57,040
his laws that there was some you know
 

7271
01:58:57,040 --> 01:58:58,390
his laws that there was some you know
like they exist outside the universe

7272
01:58:58,390 --> 01:58:58,400
like they exist outside the universe
 

7273
01:58:58,400 --> 01:58:59,589
like they exist outside the universe
they're not actually a feature of the

7274
01:58:59,589 --> 01:58:59,599
they're not actually a feature of the
 

7275
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:00,709
they're not actually a feature of the
universe they don't have to emerge out

7276
01:59:00,709 --> 01:59:00,719
universe they don't have to emerge out
 

7277
01:59:00,719 --> 01:59:02,950
universe they don't have to emerge out
of the universe itself

7278
01:59:02,950 --> 01:59:02,960
of the universe itself
 

7279
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:05,430
of the universe itself
so i think if you if you merged your two

7280
01:59:05,430 --> 01:59:05,440
so i think if you if you merged your two
 

7281
01:59:05,440 --> 01:59:07,910
so i think if you if you merged your two
views then it gets back to the god is

7282
01:59:07,910 --> 01:59:07,920
views then it gets back to the god is
 

7283
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:09,270
views then it gets back to the god is
the universe and then i think the the

7284
01:59:09,270 --> 01:59:09,280
the universe and then i think the the
 

7285
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:11,030
the universe and then i think the the
deeper question is why does it seem like

7286
01:59:11,030 --> 01:59:11,040
deeper question is why does it seem like
 

7287
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:12,709
deeper question is why does it seem like
there's meaning and purpose

7288
01:59:12,709 --> 01:59:12,719
there's meaning and purpose
 

7289
01:59:12,719 --> 01:59:13,910
there's meaning and purpose
and

7290
01:59:13,910 --> 01:59:13,920
and
 

7291
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:15,750
and
if i think about the features of the

7292
01:59:15,750 --> 01:59:15,760
if i think about the features of the
 

7293
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:17,189
if i think about the features of the
universe that give it the most meaning

7294
01:59:17,189 --> 01:59:17,199
universe that give it the most meaning
 

7295
01:59:17,199 --> 01:59:18,870
universe that give it the most meaning
and purpose those are the the what we

7296
01:59:18,870 --> 01:59:18,880
and purpose those are the the what we
 

7297
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:20,470
and purpose those are the the what we
would call the living components of the

7298
01:59:20,470 --> 01:59:20,480
would call the living components of the
 

7299
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:22,870
would call the living components of the
universe so if you wanted to say god is

7300
01:59:22,870 --> 01:59:22,880
universe so if you wanted to say god is
 

7301
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:24,709
universe so if you wanted to say god is
a physically real thing which you were

7302
01:59:24,709 --> 01:59:24,719
a physically real thing which you were
 

7303
01:59:24,719 --> 01:59:26,070
a physically real thing which you were
saying is like an emergent property of

7304
01:59:26,070 --> 01:59:26,080
saying is like an emergent property of
 

7305
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:28,070
saying is like an emergent property of
our minds but i would just say

7306
01:59:28,070 --> 01:59:28,080
our minds but i would just say
 

7307
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:30,229
our minds but i would just say
you know the way the universe creates

7308
01:59:30,229 --> 01:59:30,239
you know the way the universe creates
 

7309
01:59:30,239 --> 01:59:32,070
you know the way the universe creates
meaning and purpose there is really a

7310
01:59:32,070 --> 01:59:32,080
meaning and purpose there is really a
 

7311
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:34,550
meaning and purpose there is really a
physics there it's not like a illusory

7312
01:59:34,550 --> 01:59:34,560
physics there it's not like a illusory
 

7313
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:36,070
physics there it's not like a illusory
thing and that is just what what the

7314
01:59:36,070 --> 01:59:36,080
thing and that is just what what the
 

7315
01:59:36,080 --> 01:59:37,750
thing and that is just what what the
physics of life is

7316
01:59:37,750 --> 01:59:37,760
physics of life is
 

7317
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:41,109
physics of life is
um is it is it possible that we've

7318
01:59:41,109 --> 01:59:41,119
um is it is it possible that we've
 

7319
01:59:41,119 --> 01:59:43,109
um is it is it possible that we've
forgotten much of the mechanisms that

7320
01:59:43,109 --> 01:59:43,119
forgotten much of the mechanisms that
 

7321
01:59:43,119 --> 01:59:45,430
forgotten much of the mechanisms that
created the universe

7322
01:59:45,430 --> 01:59:45,440
created the universe
 

7323
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:46,870
created the universe
so like is

7324
01:59:46,870 --> 01:59:46,880
so like is
 

7325
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:49,270
so like is
so basically you know whatever if god is

7326
01:59:49,270 --> 01:59:49,280
so basically you know whatever if god is
 

7327
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:50,550
so basically you know whatever if god is
that mechanism

7328
01:59:50,550 --> 01:59:50,560
that mechanism
 

7329
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:52,390
that mechanism
we just leave parts of that behind well

7330
01:59:52,390 --> 01:59:52,400
we just leave parts of that behind well
 

7331
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:53,669
we just leave parts of that behind well
but the universe is constantly

7332
01:59:53,669 --> 01:59:53,679
but the universe is constantly
 

7333
01:59:53,679 --> 01:59:55,350
but the universe is constantly
generating itself so if god is that

7334
01:59:55,350 --> 01:59:55,360
generating itself so if god is that
 

7335
01:59:55,360 --> 01:59:57,030
generating itself so if god is that
mechanism it would be that that would

7336
01:59:57,030 --> 01:59:57,040
mechanism it would be that that would
 

7337
01:59:57,040 --> 01:59:59,270
mechanism it would be that that would
still be active today i don't belie like

7338
01:59:59,270 --> 01:59:59,280
still be active today i don't belie like
 

7339
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:02,790
still be active today i don't belie like
i'm agnostic but if i if i if i

7340
02:00:02,790 --> 02:00:02,800
i'm agnostic but if i if i if i
 

7341
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:04,470
i'm agnostic but if i if i if i
recall would call the things i believe

7342
02:00:04,470 --> 02:00:04,480
recall would call the things i believe
 

7343
02:00:04,480 --> 02:00:06,629
recall would call the things i believe
in god in the way that some people

7344
02:00:06,629 --> 02:00:06,639
in god in the way that some people
 

7345
02:00:06,639 --> 02:00:09,430
in god in the way that some people
talk about god i would say that god is

7346
02:00:09,430 --> 02:00:09,440
talk about god i would say that god is
 

7347
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:12,070
talk about god i would say that god is
you know like in the like universe now

7348
02:00:12,070 --> 02:00:12,080
you know like in the like universe now
 

7349
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:14,070
you know like in the like universe now
it's not an absent thing

7350
02:00:14,070 --> 02:00:14,080
it's not an absent thing
 

7351
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:15,589
it's not an absent thing
are you

7352
02:00:15,589 --> 02:00:15,599
are you
 

7353
02:00:15,599 --> 02:00:17,669
are you
i'm so i think there's a mislabeling

7354
02:00:17,669 --> 02:00:17,679
i'm so i think there's a mislabeling
 

7355
02:00:17,679 --> 02:00:18,870
i'm so i think there's a mislabeling
here because you're

7356
02:00:18,870 --> 02:00:18,880
here because you're
 

7357
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:20,550
here because you're
i mean from

7358
02:00:20,550 --> 02:00:20,560
i mean from
 

7359
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:23,510
i mean from
i mean i'm

7360
02:00:23,510 --> 02:00:23,520

 

7361
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:27,430

a professional idiot um actually but but

7362
02:00:27,430 --> 02:00:27,440
a professional idiot um actually but but
 

7363

7371
02:00:36,239 --> 02:00:37,830
professionally but i think for it
i would say if you were talking about

yeah but i feel quite uncomfortable
articulating but i'll try

7380
02:00:44,870 --> 02:00:44,880
articulating but i'll try
 

7381
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:46,709
articulating but i'll try
for me a lot of people that think of god

7382
02:00:46,709 --> 02:00:46,719
for me a lot of people that think of god
 

7383
02:00:46,719 --> 02:00:48,870
for me a lot of people that think of god
as a consciousness a reasoning entity

7384
02:00:48,870 --> 02:00:48,880
as a consciousness a reasoning entity
 

7385
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:52,390
as a consciousness a reasoning entity
that actually has causal power

7386
02:00:52,390 --> 02:00:52,400
that actually has causal power
 

7387
02:00:52,400 --> 02:00:54,229
that actually has causal power
and you're just human like intelligence

7388
02:00:54,229 --> 02:00:54,239
and you're just human like intelligence
 

7389
02:00:54,239 --> 02:00:56,229
and you're just human like intelligence
and you're and so you're like then

7390
02:00:56,229 --> 02:00:56,239
and you're and so you're like then
 

7391
02:00:56,239 --> 02:00:57,669
and you're and so you're like then
you're saying like gravity could be god

7392
02:00:57,669 --> 02:00:57,679
you're saying like gravity could be god
 

7393
02:00:57,679 --> 02:00:59,750
you're saying like gravity could be god
or time could be god i mean i think for

7394
02:00:59,750 --> 02:00:59,760
or time could be god i mean i think for
 

7395
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:01,109
or time could be god i mean i think for
me

7396
02:01:01,109 --> 02:01:01,119
me
 

7397
02:01:01,119 --> 02:01:03,189
me
for my conception of time is probably as

7398
02:01:03,189 --> 02:01:03,199
for my conception of time is probably as
 

7399
02:01:03,199 --> 02:01:05,510
for my conception of time is probably as
fundamental as god because it gave rise

7400
02:01:05,510 --> 02:01:05,520
fundamental as god because it gave rise
 

7401
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:07,510
fundamental as god because it gave rise
to human intelligence and consciousness

7402
02:01:07,510 --> 02:01:07,520
to human intelligence and consciousness
 

7403
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:09,350
to human intelligence and consciousness
in which we can have this abstract

7404
02:01:09,350 --> 02:01:09,360
in which we can have this abstract
 

7405
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:10,790
in which we can have this abstract
notion of god

7406
02:01:10,790 --> 02:01:10,800
notion of god
 

7407
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:11,910
notion of god
um

7408
02:01:11,910 --> 02:01:11,920
um
 

7409
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:13,990
um
so i i think that

7410
02:01:13,990 --> 02:01:14,000
so i i think that
 

7411
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:15,910
so i i think that
you're maybe talking about god in a very

7412
02:01:15,910 --> 02:01:15,920
you're maybe talking about god in a very
 

7413
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:18,470
you're maybe talking about god in a very
mechanistic kind of unsophisticated

7414
02:01:18,470 --> 02:01:18,480
mechanistic kind of unsophisticated
 

7415
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:19,350
mechanistic kind of unsophisticated
sense

7416
02:01:19,350 --> 02:01:19,360
sense
 

7417
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:20,709
sense
whereas other people say that god is

7418
02:01:20,709 --> 02:01:20,719
whereas other people say that god is
 

7419
02:01:20,719 --> 02:01:22,310
whereas other people say that god is
more sophisticated and got all this you

7420
02:01:22,310 --> 02:01:22,320
more sophisticated and got all this you
 

7421
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:24,070
more sophisticated and got all this you
know feelings and love and

7422
02:01:24,070 --> 02:01:24,080
know feelings and love and
 

7423
02:01:24,080 --> 02:01:25,109
know feelings and love and
you know

7424
02:01:25,109 --> 02:01:25,119
you know
 

7425
02:01:25,119 --> 02:01:27,669
you know
and this abstracting ability so

7426
02:01:27,669 --> 02:01:27,679
and this abstracting ability so
 

7427
02:01:27,679 --> 02:01:29,589
and this abstracting ability so
is that what or do you mean that do you

7428
02:01:29,589 --> 02:01:29,599
is that what or do you mean that do you
 

7429
02:01:29,599 --> 02:01:32,229
is that what or do you mean that do you
mean god as in this conscious entity

7430
02:01:32,229 --> 02:01:32,239
mean god as in this conscious entity
 

7431
02:01:32,239 --> 02:01:34,149
mean god as in this conscious entity
that decided to flick the universe into

7432
02:01:34,149 --> 02:01:34,159
that decided to flick the universe into
 

7433
02:01:34,159 --> 02:01:35,990
that decided to flick the universe into
existence

7434
02:01:35,990 --> 02:01:36,000
existence
 

7435
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,750
existence
well

7436
02:01:37,750 --> 02:01:37,760
well
 

7437
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:41,189
well
one of the features that god

7438
02:01:41,189 --> 02:01:41,199
one of the features that god
 

7439
02:01:41,199 --> 02:01:44,149
one of the features that god
would have is the ability to flick the

7440
02:01:44,149 --> 02:01:44,159
would have is the ability to flick the
 

7441
02:01:44,159 --> 02:01:46,629
would have is the ability to flick the
universe into existence

7442
02:01:46,629 --> 02:01:46,639
universe into existence
 

7443
02:01:46,639 --> 02:01:49,430
universe into existence
i you know like windows 95 i don't know

7444
02:01:49,430 --> 02:01:49,440
i you know like windows 95 i don't know
 

7445
02:01:49,440 --> 02:01:52,149
i you know like windows 95 i don't know
if god is windows 95 or windows xp or

7446
02:01:52,149 --> 02:01:52,159
if god is windows 95 or windows xp or
 

7447
02:01:52,159 --> 02:01:54,629
if god is windows 95 or windows xp or
windows 10 i don't know the full feature

7448
02:01:54,629 --> 02:01:54,639
windows 10 i don't know the full feature
 

7449
02:01:54,639 --> 02:01:57,350
windows 10 i don't know the full feature
set okay so you at the very least you

7450
02:01:57,350 --> 02:01:57,360
set okay so you at the very least you
 

7451
02:01:57,360 --> 02:01:58,709
set okay so you at the very least you
have to flick the universe into

7452
02:01:58,709 --> 02:01:58,719
have to flick the universe into
 

7453
02:01:58,719 --> 02:01:59,830
have to flick the universe into
existence

7454
02:01:59,830 --> 02:01:59,840
existence
 

7455
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:01,510
existence
and then

7456
02:02:01,510 --> 02:02:01,520
and then
 

7457
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:04,229
and then
other features might include ability to

7458
02:02:04,229 --> 02:02:04,239
other features might include ability to
 

7459
02:02:04,239 --> 02:02:05,990
other features might include ability to
interact with that universe in

7460
02:02:05,990 --> 02:02:06,000
interact with that universe in
 

7461
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,510
interact with that universe in
interesting ways

7462
02:02:07,510 --> 02:02:07,520
interesting ways
 

7463
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:08,709
interesting ways
and then

7464
02:02:08,709 --> 02:02:08,719
and then
 

7465
02:02:08,719 --> 02:02:10,790
and then
how do you interact with the universe

7466
02:02:10,790 --> 02:02:10,800
how do you interact with the universe
 

7467
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:12,310
how do you interact with the universe
interesting ways you have to be able to

7468
02:02:12,310 --> 02:02:12,320
interesting ways you have to be able to
 

7469
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:13,990
interesting ways you have to be able to
speak the language of its different

7470
02:02:13,990 --> 02:02:14,000
speak the language of its different
 

7471
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:15,109
speak the language of its different
components

7472
02:02:15,109 --> 02:02:15,119
components
 

7473
02:02:15,119 --> 02:02:17,510
components
so in order to interact with humans

7474
02:02:17,510 --> 02:02:17,520
so in order to interact with humans
 

7475
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:18,790
so in order to interact with humans
you have to

7476
02:02:18,790 --> 02:02:18,800
you have to
 

7477
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:20,310
you have to
um

7478
02:02:20,310 --> 02:02:20,320
um
 

7479
02:02:20,320 --> 02:02:24,229
um
know how to act human-like

7480
02:02:24,229 --> 02:02:24,239

 

7481
02:02:24,239 --> 02:02:28,790

so so i don't i don't know

7482
02:02:28,790 --> 02:02:28,800

 

7483
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:31,589

but it seems like

7484
02:02:31,589 --> 02:02:31,599
but it seems like
 

7485
02:02:31,599 --> 02:02:34,709
but it seems like
whatever mechanism created the universe

7486
02:02:34,709 --> 02:02:34,719
whatever mechanism created the universe
 

7487
02:02:34,719 --> 02:02:37,030
whatever mechanism created the universe
might want

7488
02:02:37,030 --> 02:02:37,040
might want
 

7489
02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:39,030
might want
to also generate

7490
02:02:39,030 --> 02:02:39,040
to also generate
 

7491
02:02:39,040 --> 02:02:40,950
to also generate
local pockets of mechanisms that can

7492
02:02:40,950 --> 02:02:40,960
local pockets of mechanisms that can
 

7493
02:02:40,960 --> 02:02:43,589
local pockets of mechanisms that can
interact with that

7494
02:02:43,589 --> 02:02:43,599
interact with that
 

7495
02:02:43,599 --> 02:02:44,950
interact with that
inject

7496
02:02:44,950 --> 02:02:44,960
inject
 

7497
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:46,550
inject
god was lonely

7498
02:02:46,550 --> 02:02:46,560
god was lonely
 

7499
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:48,470
god was lonely

02:02:48,470 --> 02:02:48,480
yeah it was long i mean it could be just
 

7501
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:50,390
yeah it was long i mean it could be just
a teenager and another

7502
02:02:50,390 --> 02:02:50,400
a teenager and another
 

7503
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:52,310
a teenager and another
just playing a video yeah maybe well i

7504
02:02:52,310 --> 02:02:52,320
just playing a video yeah maybe well i
 

7505
02:02:52,320 --> 02:02:54,550

was gonna say i mean i i don't so this
 

7507
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:56,790
was gonna say i mean i i don't so this
is referring from our origin of life

7508
02:02:56,790 --> 02:02:56,800
is referring from our origin of life
 

7509
02:02:56,800 --> 02:02:58,790
is referring from our origin of life
engine it's like i i don't believe in

7510
02:02:58,790 --> 02:02:58,800
engine it's like i i don't believe in
 

7511
02:02:58,800 --> 02:02:59,910
engine it's like i i don't believe in
god but that doesn't mean i don't want

7512
02:02:59,910 --> 02:02:59,920
god but that doesn't mean i don't want
 

7513
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:01,430
god but that doesn't mean i don't want
to be one

7514
02:03:01,430 --> 02:03:01,440

7515
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:02,229
to be one
right

7516
02:03:02,229 --> 02:03:02,239
right
 

7517
02:03:02,239 --> 02:03:03,589
right
i want to make a universe and make a

7518
02:03:03,589 --> 02:03:03,599
i want to make a universe and make a
 

7519
02:03:03,599 --> 02:03:05,589
i want to make a universe and make a
life form but that maybe that may be

7520
02:03:05,589 --> 02:03:05,599
life form but that maybe that may be
 

7521
02:03:05,599 --> 02:03:07,750
life form but that maybe that may be
rude to people who have you know dear

7522
02:03:07,750 --> 02:03:07,760
rude to people who have you know dear
 

7523
02:03:07,760 --> 02:03:11,109
rude to people who have you know dear
religious beliefs what i mean by that is

7524
02:03:11,109 --> 02:03:11,119
religious beliefs what i mean by that is
 

7525
02:03:11,119 --> 02:03:13,589
religious beliefs what i mean by that is
isn't it if we are able to create an

7526
02:03:13,589 --> 02:03:13,599
isn't it if we are able to create an
 

7527
02:03:13,599 --> 02:03:15,589
isn't it if we are able to create an
entirely new life form different

7528
02:03:15,589 --> 02:03:15,599
entirely new life form different
 

7529
02:03:15,599 --> 02:03:19,350
entirely new life form different
chemistry different culture

7530
02:03:19,350 --> 02:03:19,360

 

7531
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:20,870

what does it make up and makes us good

7532
02:03:20,870 --> 02:03:20,880
what does it make up and makes us good
 

7533
02:03:20,880 --> 02:03:22,470
what does it make up and makes us good
by that definition it makes us gods

7534
02:03:22,470 --> 02:03:22,480
by that definition it makes us gods
 

7535
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:24,229
by that definition it makes us gods
right well there is i mean like when you

7536
02:03:24,229 --> 02:03:24,239
right well there is i mean like when you
 

7537
02:03:24,239 --> 02:03:26,390
right well there is i mean like when you
have children you're like one of the

7538
02:03:26,390 --> 02:03:26,400
have children you're like one of the
 

7539
02:03:26,400 --> 02:03:28,629
have children you're like one of the
magical things of that is you're kind of

7540
02:03:28,629 --> 02:03:28,639
magical things of that is you're kind of
 

7541
02:03:28,639 --> 02:03:30,950
magical things of that is you're kind of
mini gods i mean first of all

7542
02:03:30,950 --> 02:03:30,960
mini gods i mean first of all
 

7543
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:33,189
mini gods i mean first of all
uh from a child's perspective parents

7544
02:03:33,189 --> 02:03:33,199
uh from a child's perspective parents
 

7545
02:03:33,199 --> 02:03:35,830
uh from a child's perspective parents
are gods for quite a while

7546
02:03:35,830 --> 02:03:35,840
are gods for quite a while
 

7547
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:37,589
are gods for quite a while
and then you i mean they're they're in

7548
02:03:37,589 --> 02:03:37,599
and then you i mean they're they're in
 

7549
02:03:37,599 --> 02:03:39,270
and then you i mean they're they're in
the positive sense there's a magic to

7550
02:03:39,270 --> 02:03:39,280
the positive sense there's a magic to
 

7551
02:03:39,280 --> 02:03:41,430
the positive sense there's a magic to
that's why i love robotics is you

7552
02:03:41,430 --> 02:03:41,440
that's why i love robotics is you
 

7553
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:43,750
that's why i love robotics is you
instill life into something and that

7554
02:03:43,750 --> 02:03:43,760
instill life into something and that
 

7555
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:45,990
instill life into something and that
makes you

7556
02:03:45,990 --> 02:03:46,000
makes you
 

7557
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:49,589
makes you
um feel god like in a sort of positive

7558
02:03:49,589 --> 02:03:49,599
um feel god like in a sort of positive
 

7559
02:03:49,599 --> 02:03:51,510
um feel god like in a sort of positive
way being a creator is a positive

7560
02:03:51,510 --> 02:03:51,520
way being a creator is a positive
 

7561
02:03:51,520 --> 02:03:54,149
way being a creator is a positive
creator yeah exactly and a small scale

7562
02:03:54,149 --> 02:03:54,159
creator yeah exactly and a small scale
 

7563
02:03:54,159 --> 02:03:57,030
creator yeah exactly and a small scale
and then god is would be a creator at

7564
02:03:57,030 --> 02:03:57,040
and then god is would be a creator at
 

7565
02:03:57,040 --> 02:03:59,669
and then god is would be a creator at
the largest possible scale i suppose

7566
02:03:59,669 --> 02:03:59,679
the largest possible scale i suppose
 

7567
02:03:59,679 --> 02:04:00,550
the largest possible scale i suppose
okay

7568
02:04:00,550 --> 02:04:00,560
okay
 

7569
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:05,109
okay
you mentioned offline the assembledtron

7570
02:04:05,109 --> 02:04:05,119
you mentioned offline the assembledtron
 

7571
02:04:05,119 --> 02:04:08,310
you mentioned offline the assembledtron
assemblytron assemblytron yep uh what

7572
02:04:08,310 --> 02:04:08,320
assemblytron assemblytron yep uh what
 

7573
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:09,990
assemblytron assemblytron yep uh what
what's an assemblytron these are the

7574
02:04:09,990 --> 02:04:10,000
what's an assemblytron these are the
 

7575
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,430
what's an assemblytron these are the
there's an early idea of something

7576
02:04:11,430 --> 02:04:11,440
there's an early idea of something
 

7577
02:04:11,440 --> 02:04:13,990
there's an early idea of something
you're thinking about um so sarah's team

7578
02:04:13,990 --> 02:04:14,000
you're thinking about um so sarah's team
 

7579
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,669
you're thinking about um so sarah's team
uh well i think sarah's team are

7580
02:04:15,669 --> 02:04:15,679
uh well i think sarah's team are
 

7581
02:04:15,679 --> 02:04:17,270
uh well i think sarah's team are
interested in um

7582
02:04:17,270 --> 02:04:17,280
interested in um
 

7583
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:19,589
interested in um
under using ai to understand life my

7584
02:04:19,589 --> 02:04:19,599
under using ai to understand life my
 

7585
02:04:19,599 --> 02:04:22,149
under using ai to understand life my
team is and i'm and i'm think wondering

7586
02:04:22,149 --> 02:04:22,159
team is and i'm and i'm think wondering
 

7587
02:04:22,159 --> 02:04:24,229
team is and i'm and i'm think wondering
if we could apply the principles of

7588
02:04:24,229 --> 02:04:24,239
if we could apply the principles of
 

7589
02:04:24,239 --> 02:04:26,390
if we could apply the principles of
assembly theory that is

7590
02:04:26,390 --> 02:04:26,400
assembly theory that is
 

7591
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:28,229
assembly theory that is
um the causal structure that you get

7592
02:04:28,229 --> 02:04:28,239
um the causal structure that you get
 

7593
02:04:28,239 --> 02:04:30,790
um the causal structure that you get
with assembly theory and hybridize it

7594
02:04:30,790 --> 02:04:30,800
with assembly theory and hybridize it
 

7595
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:33,510
with assembly theory and hybridize it
and make a new type of

7596
02:04:33,510 --> 02:04:33,520
and make a new type of
 

7597
02:04:33,520 --> 02:04:35,430
and make a new type of
neuron if you like i mean there are

7598
02:04:35,430 --> 02:04:35,440
neuron if you like i mean there are
 

7599
02:04:35,440 --> 02:04:36,470
neuron if you like i mean there are
causal

7600
02:04:36,470 --> 02:04:36,480
causal
 

7601
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:38,390
causal
neural networks out there but they are

7602
02:04:38,390 --> 02:04:38,400
neural networks out there but they are
 

7603
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:40,629
neural networks out there but they are
they are not quite the architecture like

7604
02:04:40,629 --> 02:04:40,639
they are not quite the architecture like
 

7605
02:04:40,639 --> 02:04:42,470
they are not quite the architecture like
what i would like i would like to

7606
02:04:42,470 --> 02:04:42,480
what i would like i would like to
 

7607
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:43,669
what i would like i would like to
associate

7608
02:04:43,669 --> 02:04:43,679
associate
 

7609
02:04:43,679 --> 02:04:45,669
associate
memory bits with um

7610
02:04:45,669 --> 02:04:45,679
memory bits with um
 

7611
02:04:45,679 --> 02:04:48,069
memory bits with um
basically i'd like to make a rather than

7612
02:04:48,069 --> 02:04:48,079
basically i'd like to make a rather than
 

7613
02:04:48,079 --> 02:04:50,390
basically i'd like to make a rather than
have an asic for neural networks i want

7614
02:04:50,390 --> 02:04:50,400
have an asic for neural networks i want
 

7615
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:54,229
have an asic for neural networks i want
to make it asic for assembly networks

7616
02:04:54,229 --> 02:04:54,239
to make it asic for assembly networks
 

7617
02:04:54,239 --> 02:04:56,950
to make it asic for assembly networks
right and um so can you say that again

7618
02:04:56,950 --> 02:04:56,960
right and um so can you say that again
 

7619
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:59,830
right and um so can you say that again
assembly networks uh

7620
02:04:59,830 --> 02:04:59,840
assembly networks uh
 

7621
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:02,069
assembly networks uh
uh so what what is a

7622
02:05:02,069 --> 02:05:02,079
uh so what what is a
 

7623
02:05:02,079 --> 02:05:03,669
uh so what what is a
like a

7624
02:05:03,669 --> 02:05:03,679
like a
 

7625
02:05:03,679 --> 02:05:05,510
like a
a thing with an input and output and

7626
02:05:05,510 --> 02:05:05,520
a thing with an input and output and
 

7627
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:07,350
a thing with an input and output and
it's like a neural network type of thing

7628
02:05:07,350 --> 02:05:07,360
it's like a neural network type of thing
 

7629
02:05:07,360 --> 02:05:08,709
it's like a neural network type of thing
what does it do exactly what's the input

7630
02:05:08,709 --> 02:05:08,719
what does it do exactly what's the input
 

7631
02:05:08,719 --> 02:05:11,189
what does it do exactly what's the input
what's the output so in in this case so

7632
02:05:11,189 --> 02:05:11,199
what's the output so in in this case so
 

7633
02:05:11,199 --> 02:05:12,550
what's the output so in in this case so
if you're talking about a general neural

7634
02:05:12,550 --> 02:05:12,560
if you're talking about a general neural
 

7635
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:14,950
if you're talking about a general neural
network i mean in general neural network

7636
02:05:14,950 --> 02:05:14,960
network i mean in general neural network
 

7637
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:16,950
network i mean in general neural network
you can train it on all sort any sort of

7638
02:05:16,950 --> 02:05:16,960
you can train it on all sort any sort of
 

7639
02:05:16,960 --> 02:05:18,870
you can train it on all sort any sort of
data right depending on

7640
02:05:18,870 --> 02:05:18,880
data right depending on
 

7641
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:22,550
data right depending on
the the framework whether it's like um

7642
02:05:22,550 --> 02:05:22,560
the the framework whether it's like um
 

7643
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:23,669
the the framework whether it's like um
text or

7644
02:05:23,669 --> 02:05:23,679
text or
 

7645
02:05:23,679 --> 02:05:25,830
text or
or image data or whatnot

7646
02:05:25,830 --> 02:05:25,840
or image data or whatnot
 

7647
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:28,870
or image data or whatnot
and that's fine but there's no

7648
02:05:28,870 --> 02:05:28,880
and that's fine but there's no
 

7649
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:30,790
and that's fine but there's no
causal structure associated with that

7650
02:05:30,790 --> 02:05:30,800
causal structure associated with that
 

7651
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:32,790
causal structure associated with that
data now just imagine

7652
02:05:32,790 --> 02:05:32,800
data now just imagine
 

7653
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:34,149

rather than you know let's say we're
 

7655
02:05:34,159 --> 02:05:35,109

02:05:35,109 --> 02:05:35,119
going to classify a difference between
 

7657
02:05:35,119 --> 02:05:36,629
going to classify a difference between
cat and good dog right classic cat and

02:05:36,629 --> 02:05:36,639
cat and good dog right classic cat and
 

7659
02:05:36,639 --> 02:05:39,270
cat and good dog right classic cat and
dog neural network what about if the

7660
02:05:39,270 --> 02:05:39,280
dog neural network what about if the
 

7661
02:05:39,280 --> 02:05:42,310
dog neural network what about if the
system understood the assembly space it

7662
02:05:42,310 --> 02:05:42,320
system understood the assembly space it
 

7663
02:05:42,320 --> 02:05:44,950
system understood the assembly space it
created the cat and the dog

7664
02:05:44,950 --> 02:05:44,960
created the cat and the dog
 

7665
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:46,709
created the cat and the dog
and rather than

7666
02:05:46,709 --> 02:05:46,719
and rather than
 

7667
02:05:46,719 --> 02:05:48,390
and rather than
guessing what was happening and training

02:05:48,390 --> 02:05:48,400
guessing what was happening and training
 

7669

7673
02:05:53,679 --> 02:05:55,270

you almost like you could imagine doing

7674
02:05:55,270 --> 02:05:55,280
you almost like you could imagine doing
 

7675
02:05:55,280 --> 02:05:56,470
you almost like you could imagine doing

7685
02:06:04,719 --> 02:06:06,629
back a step and and i wonder if that is
actually the origin of intelligence or

7686
02:06:06,629 --> 02:06:06,639
actually the origin of intelligence or
 

7687
02:06:06,639 --> 02:06:08,709
actually the origin of intelligence or
how we'll crack intelligence

7688
02:06:08,709 --> 02:06:08,719
how we'll crack intelligence
 

7689
02:06:08,719 --> 02:06:11,270
how we'll crack intelligence
because we need to because we'll we'll

7690
02:06:11,270 --> 02:06:11,280
because we need to because we'll we'll
 

7691
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:14,629
because we need to because we'll we'll
create the entire graph of events

7692
02:06:14,629 --> 02:06:14,639
create the entire graph of events
 

7693
02:06:14,639 --> 02:06:15,669
create the entire graph of events
and

7694
02:06:15,669 --> 02:06:15,679
and
 

7695
02:06:15,679 --> 02:06:17,830
and
and be able to kind of look at calls and

7696
02:06:17,830 --> 02:06:17,840
and be able to kind of look at calls and
 

7697
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:19,109
and be able to kind of look at calls and
effect across those graphs i'm

7698
02:06:19,109 --> 02:06:19,119
effect across those graphs i'm
 

7699
02:06:19,119 --> 02:06:20,950
effect across those graphs i'm
explaining it really badly but it's it's

7700
02:06:20,950 --> 02:06:20,960
explaining it really badly but it's it's
 

7701
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:23,910
explaining it really badly but it's it's
a gene of an idea and i'm guessing very

7702
02:06:23,910 --> 02:06:23,920
a gene of an idea and i'm guessing very
 

7703
02:06:23,920 --> 02:06:25,589
a gene of an idea and i'm guessing very
smart very rich

um people in ai are already doing this

7706
02:06:29,350 --> 02:06:29,360
um people in ai are already doing this
 

7707
02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:31,669
um people in ai are already doing this

02:06:33,360 --> 02:06:35,589
trying to generate
things of high assembly index yeah and i

7712
02:06:35,589 --> 02:06:35,599
things of high assembly index yeah and i
 

7713
02:06:35,599 --> 02:06:38,069
things of high assembly index yeah and i
think that i think and and also using

7714
02:06:38,069 --> 02:06:38,079
think that i think and and also using
 

7715
02:06:38,079 --> 02:06:41,030
think that i think and and also using
causal graphs in neural networks and

7716
02:06:41,030 --> 02:06:41,040
causal graphs in neural networks and
 

7717
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:43,030
causal graphs in neural networks and
machine learning and deep learning maybe

7718
02:06:43,030 --> 02:06:43,040
machine learning and deep learning maybe
 

7719
02:06:43,040 --> 02:06:44,470
machine learning and deep learning maybe
building a new architecture i'm just

7720
02:06:44,470 --> 02:06:44,480
building a new architecture i'm just
 

7721
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:46,149
building a new architecture i'm just
wondering is there something we can get

7722
02:06:46,149 --> 02:06:46,159
wondering is there something we can get
 

7723
02:06:46,159 --> 02:06:48,709
wondering is there something we can get
out assembly theory allows us to rebuild

7724
02:06:48,709 --> 02:06:48,719
out assembly theory allows us to rebuild
 

7725
02:06:48,719 --> 02:06:51,030
out assembly theory allows us to rebuild

to give more give causation more cheaply
 

7729
02:06:54,719 --> 02:06:56,629
to give more give causation more cheaply
i mean i don't know if that's what you

7730
02:06:56,629 --> 02:06:56,639
i mean i don't know if that's what you
 

7731
02:06:56,639 --> 02:06:57,750
i mean i don't know if that's what you
we've been inventing this for a little

7732
02:06:57,750 --> 02:06:57,760
we've been inventing this for a little
 

7733
02:06:57,760 --> 02:06:59,270
we've been inventing this for a little
while but we're trying to finish the

7734
02:06:59,270 --> 02:06:59,280
while but we're trying to finish the
 

7735
02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:01,109
while but we're trying to finish the
theory paper first before we do anything

7736
02:07:01,109 --> 02:07:01,119
theory paper first before we do anything
 

7737
02:07:01,119 --> 02:07:03,669
theory paper first before we do anything
else yeah you also want to have um

7738
02:07:03,669 --> 02:07:03,679
else yeah you also want to have um
 

7739
02:07:03,679 --> 02:07:05,669
else yeah you also want to have um
say goal directed behavior in neural

7740
02:07:05,669 --> 02:07:05,679
say goal directed behavior in neural
 

7741
02:07:05,679 --> 02:07:07,510
say goal directed behavior in neural
networks then assembly theory is a good

7742
02:07:07,510 --> 02:07:07,520
networks then assembly theory is a good
 

7743
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:08,870
networks then assembly theory is a good
framework for doing that danielle's been

02:07:08,870 --> 02:07:08,880
framework for doing that danielle's been
 

7745
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:10,470
framework for doing that danielle's been
thinking about that a lot yeah and i

7746
02:07:10,470 --> 02:07:10,480
thinking about that a lot yeah and i
 

7747
02:07:10,480 --> 02:07:12,069
thinking about that a lot yeah and i
think it's a really interesting idea

7748
02:07:12,069 --> 02:07:12,079
think it's a really interesting idea
 

7749
02:07:12,079 --> 02:07:14,709
think it's a really interesting idea
that you can map concepts from

7750
02:07:14,709 --> 02:07:14,719
that you can map concepts from
 

7751
02:07:14,719 --> 02:07:16,470
that you can map concepts from
how neural networks learn to thinking

7752
02:07:16,470 --> 02:07:16,480
how neural networks learn to thinking
 

7753
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:18,149
how neural networks learn to thinking
about goal directed

7754
02:07:18,149 --> 02:07:18,159
about goal directed
 

7755
02:07:18,159 --> 02:07:19,990
about goal directed
behavior as a learning process that

7756
02:07:19,990 --> 02:07:20,000
behavior as a learning process that
 

7757
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:21,270
behavior as a learning process that
you're learning a specific goal the

7758
02:07:21,270 --> 02:07:21,280
you're learning a specific goal the
 

7759
02:07:21,280 --> 02:07:22,629
you're learning a specific goal the
universe is learning a goal when it

7760
02:07:22,629 --> 02:07:22,639
universe is learning a goal when it
 

7761
02:07:22,639 --> 02:07:24,069
universe is learning a goal when it
generates a particular structure and

7762
02:07:24,069 --> 02:07:24,079
generates a particular structure and
 

7763
02:07:24,079 --> 02:07:25,830
generates a particular structure and
that you can map that physical structure

7764
02:07:25,830 --> 02:07:25,840
that you can map that physical structure
 

7765
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:28,950
that you can map that physical structure
into a neural network how

7766
02:07:28,950 --> 02:07:28,960
into a neural network how
 

7767
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:30,709
into a neural network how
what's the goal

7768
02:07:30,709 --> 02:07:30,719
what's the goal
 

7769
02:07:30,719 --> 02:07:31,669
what's the goal
uh

7770
02:07:31,669 --> 02:07:31,679
uh
 

7771
02:07:31,679 --> 02:07:32,870
uh
well in a neural network you're

7772
02:07:32,870 --> 02:07:32,880
well in a neural network you're
 

7773
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:35,750
well in a neural network you're
designing the goal and um

7774
02:07:35,750 --> 02:07:35,760
designing the goal and um
 

7775
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:36,629
designing the goal and um
in

7776
02:07:36,629 --> 02:07:36,639
in
 

7777
02:07:36,639 --> 02:07:38,790
in
biology i mean you know people are not

7778
02:07:38,790 --> 02:07:38,800
biology i mean you know people are not
 

7779
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:40,390
biology i mean you know people are not
supposed to use teleological language in

7780
02:07:40,390 --> 02:07:40,400
supposed to use teleological language in
 

7781
02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:43,270
supposed to use teleological language in
biology which is ridiculous but um

7782
02:07:43,270 --> 02:07:43,280
biology which is ridiculous but um
 

7783
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:45,189
biology which is ridiculous but um
uh because goals are real things they're

7784
02:07:45,189 --> 02:07:45,199
uh because goals are real things they're
 

7785
02:07:45,199 --> 02:07:46,229
uh because goals are real things they're
just

7786
02:07:46,229 --> 02:07:46,239
just
 

7787
02:07:46,239 --> 02:07:47,910
just
post-selected so you can talk about

7788
02:07:47,910 --> 02:07:47,920
post-selected so you can talk about
 

7789
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:49,750
post-selected so you can talk about
goals after the fact

7790
02:07:49,750 --> 02:07:49,760
goals after the fact
 

7791
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:50,629
goals after the fact
um

7792
02:07:50,629 --> 02:07:50,639
um
 

7793
02:07:50,639 --> 02:07:52,229
um
you know once a goal emerges in the

7794
02:07:52,229 --> 02:07:52,239
you know once a goal emerges in the
 

7795
02:07:52,239 --> 02:07:54,629
you know once a goal emerges in the
universe that physical entity has a goal

7796
02:07:54,629 --> 02:07:54,639
universe that physical entity has a goal
 

7797
02:07:54,639 --> 02:07:56,470
universe that physical entity has a goal
but but lee and i came up with a test

7798
02:07:56,470 --> 02:07:56,480
but but lee and i came up with a test
 

7799
02:07:56,480 --> 02:07:58,629
but but lee and i came up with a test
for um like a turing test for goal

7800
02:07:58,629 --> 02:07:58,639
for um like a turing test for goal
 

7801
02:07:58,639 --> 02:08:00,870
for um like a turing test for goal
directed behavior uh based on the idea

7802
02:08:00,870 --> 02:08:00,880
directed behavior uh based on the idea
 

7803
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:02,069
directed behavior uh based on the idea
of assembly when like we have to

7804
02:08:02,069 --> 02:08:02,079
of assembly when like we have to
 

7805
02:08:02,079 --> 02:08:03,669
of assembly when like we have to
formalize it still but i i would like to

7806
02:08:03,669 --> 02:08:03,679
formalize it still but i i would like to
 

7807
02:08:03,679 --> 02:08:05,589
formalize it still but i i would like to
write a paper on it but like the basic

7808
02:08:05,589 --> 02:08:05,599
write a paper on it but like the basic
 

7809
02:08:05,599 --> 02:08:07,669
write a paper on it but like the basic
idea is like if you

7810
02:08:07,669 --> 02:08:07,679
idea is like if you
 

7811
02:08:07,679 --> 02:08:09,350
idea is like if you
like if you had two systems that were

7812
02:08:09,350 --> 02:08:09,360
like if you had two systems that were
 

7813
02:08:09,360 --> 02:08:11,669
like if you had two systems that were
completely equivalent

7814
02:08:11,669 --> 02:08:11,679
completely equivalent
 

7815
02:08:11,679 --> 02:08:12,550
completely equivalent
um

7816
02:08:12,550 --> 02:08:12,560
um
 

7817
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:14,550
um
you know like in the instantaneous like

7818
02:08:14,550 --> 02:08:14,560
you know like in the instantaneous like
 

7819
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:16,310
you know like in the instantaneous like
physical experimental setup so lee has

7820
02:08:16,310 --> 02:08:16,320
physical experimental setup so lee has
 

7821
02:08:16,320 --> 02:08:18,069
physical experimental setup so lee has
to figure out how to do this

7822
02:08:18,069 --> 02:08:18,079
to figure out how to do this
 

7823
02:08:18,079 --> 02:08:19,430
to figure out how to do this
but there was something that would be

7824
02:08:19,430 --> 02:08:19,440
but there was something that would be
 

7825
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:21,109
but there was something that would be
different in their future

7826
02:08:21,109 --> 02:08:21,119
different in their future
 

7827
02:08:21,119 --> 02:08:23,030
different in their future
um and there was a symmetry breaking you

7828
02:08:23,030 --> 02:08:23,040
um and there was a symmetry breaking you
 

7829
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:24,629
um and there was a symmetry breaking you
observe in the present based on that

7830
02:08:24,629 --> 02:08:24,639
observe in the present based on that
 

7831
02:08:24,639 --> 02:08:27,030
observe in the present based on that
possibility that future outcome then you

7832
02:08:27,030 --> 02:08:27,040
possibility that future outcome then you
 

7833
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:28,470
possibility that future outcome then you
could say that that system had some

7834
02:08:28,470 --> 02:08:28,480
could say that that system had some
 

7835
02:08:28,480 --> 02:08:30,470
could say that that system had some
representation of of some kind of goal

7836
02:08:30,470 --> 02:08:30,480
representation of of some kind of goal
 

7837
02:08:30,480 --> 02:08:31,910
representation of of some kind of goal
in mind about what it wanted to do in

7838
02:08:31,910 --> 02:08:31,920
in mind about what it wanted to do in
 

7839
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:32,950
in mind about what it wanted to do in
the future

7840
02:08:32,950 --> 02:08:32,960
the future
 

7841
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:35,589
the future
um and i so so goals are interesting

7842
02:08:35,589 --> 02:08:35,599
um and i so so goals are interesting
 

7843
02:08:35,599 --> 02:08:36,550
um and i so so goals are interesting
because

7844
02:08:36,550 --> 02:08:36,560
because
 

7845
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:38,629
because
they don't exist as instantaneous things

7846
02:08:38,629 --> 02:08:38,639
they don't exist as instantaneous things
 

7847
02:08:38,639 --> 02:08:40,550
they don't exist as instantaneous things
they exist across time which is one one

7848
02:08:40,550 --> 02:08:40,560
they exist across time which is one one
 

7849
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:42,550
they exist across time which is one one
of the reasons that assembly theories

7850
02:08:42,550 --> 02:08:42,560
of the reasons that assembly theories
 

7851
02:08:42,560 --> 02:08:44,470
of the reasons that assembly theories
may be more naturally

7852
02:08:44,470 --> 02:08:44,480
may be more naturally
 

7853
02:08:44,480 --> 02:08:46,629
may be more naturally
uh able to account for the existence of

7854
02:08:46,629 --> 02:08:46,639
uh able to account for the existence of
 

7855
02:08:46,639 --> 02:08:47,669
uh able to account for the existence of
goals

7856
02:08:47,669 --> 02:08:47,679
goals
 

7857
02:08:47,679 --> 02:08:51,030
goals
um so goals are they they only exist in

7858
02:08:51,030 --> 02:08:51,040
um so goals are they they only exist in
 

7859
02:08:51,040 --> 02:08:52,149
um so goals are they they only exist in
time

7860
02:08:52,149 --> 02:08:52,159
time
 

7861
02:08:52,159 --> 02:08:55,030
time
or they manifest themselves in time

7862
02:08:55,030 --> 02:08:55,040
or they manifest themselves in time
 

7863
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:56,390
or they manifest themselves in time
through

7864
02:08:56,390 --> 02:08:56,400
through
 

7865
02:08:56,400 --> 02:08:59,350
through
um you said symmetry breaking so it's

7866
02:08:59,350 --> 02:08:59,360
um you said symmetry breaking so it's
 

7867
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:01,109
um you said symmetry breaking so it's
it's almost like

7868
02:09:01,109 --> 02:09:01,119
it's almost like
 

7869
02:09:01,119 --> 02:09:03,189
it's almost like
imagine like if representations in your

7870
02:09:03,189 --> 02:09:03,199
imagine like if representations in your
 

7871
02:09:03,199 --> 02:09:04,870
imagine like if representations in your
mind are real right

7872
02:09:04,870 --> 02:09:04,880
mind are real right
 

7873
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:07,030
mind are real right
um and you you can imagine future

7874
02:09:07,030 --> 02:09:07,040
um and you you can imagine future
 

7875
02:09:07,040 --> 02:09:09,109
um and you you can imagine future
possibilities but imagine everything

7876
02:09:09,109 --> 02:09:09,119
possibilities but imagine everything
 

7877
02:09:09,119 --> 02:09:11,189
possibilities but imagine everything
else is physically equivalent and the

7878
02:09:11,189 --> 02:09:11,199
else is physically equivalent and the
 

7879
02:09:11,199 --> 02:09:13,109
else is physically equivalent and the
only thing that you actually change your

7880
02:09:13,109 --> 02:09:13,119
only thing that you actually change your
 

7881
02:09:13,119 --> 02:09:15,430
only thing that you actually change your
decision based on is what you model as

7882
02:09:15,430 --> 02:09:15,440
decision based on is what you model as
 

7883
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:17,189
decision based on is what you model as
being the future outcome

7884
02:09:17,189 --> 02:09:17,199
being the future outcome
 

7885
02:09:17,199 --> 02:09:19,750
being the future outcome
then somehow that representation in your

7886
02:09:19,750 --> 02:09:19,760
then somehow that representation in your
 

7887
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:21,189
then somehow that representation in your
mind of the future outcome becomes

7888
02:09:21,189 --> 02:09:21,199
mind of the future outcome becomes
 

7889
02:09:21,199 --> 02:09:22,550
mind of the future outcome becomes
causal to what you're doing now so it's

7890
02:09:22,550 --> 02:09:22,560
causal to what you're doing now so it's
 

7891
02:09:22,560 --> 02:09:24,629
causal to what you're doing now so it's
kind of like retrocausal effect but it's

7892
02:09:24,629 --> 02:09:24,639
kind of like retrocausal effect but it's
 

7893
02:09:24,639 --> 02:09:26,390
kind of like retrocausal effect but it's
not actually retrocausal it's just that

7894
02:09:26,390 --> 02:09:26,400
not actually retrocausal it's just that
 

7895
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:27,189
not actually retrocausal it's just that
your

7896
02:09:27,189 --> 02:09:27,199
your
 

7897
02:09:27,199 --> 02:09:29,750
your
your assembly space is actually

7898
02:09:29,750 --> 02:09:29,760
your assembly space is actually
 

7899
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:31,910
your assembly space is actually
includes those possibilities as as part

7900
02:09:31,910 --> 02:09:31,920
includes those possibilities as as part
 

7901
02:09:31,920 --> 02:09:33,109
includes those possibilities as as part
of the structure it's just you're not

7902
02:09:33,109 --> 02:09:33,119
of the structure it's just you're not
 

7903
02:09:33,119 --> 02:09:34,470
of the structure it's just you're not
observing all the features the assembly

7904
02:09:34,470 --> 02:09:34,480
observing all the features the assembly
 

7905
02:09:34,480 --> 02:09:35,910
observing all the features the assembly
space in the current moment

7906
02:09:35,910 --> 02:09:35,920
space in the current moment
 

7907
02:09:35,920 --> 02:09:37,589
space in the current moment
well the possibilities exist but they

7908
02:09:37,589 --> 02:09:37,599
well the possibilities exist but they
 

7909
02:09:37,599 --> 02:09:39,510
well the possibilities exist but they
don't become

7910
02:09:39,510 --> 02:09:39,520
don't become
 

7911
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:42,629
don't become
a goal until they're realized so so one

7912
02:09:42,629 --> 02:09:42,639
a goal until they're realized so so one
 

7913
02:09:42,639 --> 02:09:44,149
a goal until they're realized so so one
of the features of assembly space that's

7914
02:09:44,149 --> 02:09:44,159
of the features of assembly space that's
 

7915
02:09:44,159 --> 02:09:46,229
of the features of assembly space that's
super interesting and it's easier to

7916
02:09:46,229 --> 02:09:46,239
super interesting and it's easier to
 

7917
02:09:46,239 --> 02:09:48,870
super interesting and it's easier to
envision with like legos for example

7918
02:09:48,870 --> 02:09:48,880
envision with like legos for example
 

7919
02:09:48,880 --> 02:09:50,470
envision with like legos for example
is if you're thinking about an assembly

7920
02:09:50,470 --> 02:09:50,480
is if you're thinking about an assembly
 

7921
02:09:50,480 --> 02:09:51,990
is if you're thinking about an assembly
space you can't observe the entire

7922
02:09:51,990 --> 02:09:52,000
space you can't observe the entire
 

7923
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:53,990
space you can't observe the entire
assembly space in any instant in time so

7924
02:09:53,990 --> 02:09:54,000
assembly space in any instant in time so
 

7925
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:55,910
assembly space in any instant in time so
if you imagine a stack of legos and you

7926
02:09:55,910 --> 02:09:55,920
if you imagine a stack of legos and you
 

7927
02:09:55,920 --> 02:09:57,430
if you imagine a stack of legos and you
want to look at the assembly space of a

7928
02:09:57,430 --> 02:09:57,440
want to look at the assembly space of a
 

7929
02:09:57,440 --> 02:09:59,270
want to look at the assembly space of a
stack of legos you have to break the

7930
02:09:59,270 --> 02:09:59,280
stack of legos you have to break the
 

7931
02:09:59,280 --> 02:10:00,470
stack of legos you have to break the
legos apart

7932
02:10:00,470 --> 02:10:00,480
legos apart
 

7933
02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:02,229
legos apart
and then you look and then you look at

7934
02:10:02,229 --> 02:10:02,239
and then you look and then you look at
 

7935
02:10:02,239 --> 02:10:04,390
and then you look and then you look at
all the possible ways of building up the

7936
02:10:04,390 --> 02:10:04,400
all the possible ways of building up the
 

7937
02:10:04,400 --> 02:10:06,310
all the possible ways of building up the
original object so now you have in your

7938
02:10:06,310 --> 02:10:06,320
original object so now you have in your
 

7939
02:10:06,320 --> 02:10:08,310
original object so now you have in your
mind the goal of building that object

7940
02:10:08,310 --> 02:10:08,320
mind the goal of building that object
 

7941
02:10:08,320 --> 02:10:09,669
mind the goal of building that object
and you have all the possible ways of

7942
02:10:09,669 --> 02:10:09,679
and you have all the possible ways of
 

7943
02:10:09,679 --> 02:10:11,830
and you have all the possible ways of
doing it and those are actual physical

7944
02:10:11,830 --> 02:10:11,840
doing it and those are actual physical
 

7945
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:13,510
doing it and those are actual physical
features of that object but that object

7946
02:10:13,510 --> 02:10:13,520
features of that object but that object
 

7947
02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:15,669
features of that object but that object
doesn't always exist what exists is the

7948
02:10:15,669 --> 02:10:15,679
doesn't always exist what exists is the
 

7949
02:10:15,679 --> 02:10:17,589
doesn't always exist what exists is the
possibility of generating it right and

7950
02:10:17,589 --> 02:10:17,599
possibility of generating it right and
 

7951
02:10:17,599 --> 02:10:20,069
possibility of generating it right and
the possibilities are always infinite

7952
02:10:20,069 --> 02:10:20,079
the possibilities are always infinite
 

7953
02:10:20,079 --> 02:10:22,310
the possibilities are always infinite
uh well for that particular object

7954
02:10:22,310 --> 02:10:22,320
uh well for that particular object
 

7955
02:10:22,320 --> 02:10:23,669
uh well for that particular object
you know like you know it has a

7956
02:10:23,669 --> 02:10:23,679
you know like you know it has a
 

7957
02:10:23,679 --> 02:10:25,589
you know like you know it has a
well-defined assembly space and i guess

7958
02:10:25,589 --> 02:10:25,599
well-defined assembly space and i guess
 

7959
02:10:25,599 --> 02:10:27,430
well-defined assembly space and i guess
what i'm saying is that object is the

7960
02:10:27,430 --> 02:10:27,440
what i'm saying is that object is the
 

7961
02:10:27,440 --> 02:10:29,830
what i'm saying is that object is the
assembly space but you actually have to

7962
02:10:29,830 --> 02:10:29,840
assembly space but you actually have to
 

7963
02:10:29,840 --> 02:10:32,069
assembly space but you actually have to
unpack that object across time to view

7964
02:10:32,069 --> 02:10:32,079
unpack that object across time to view
 

7965
02:10:32,079 --> 02:10:33,669
unpack that object across time to view
that feature of it it's only an

7966
02:10:33,669 --> 02:10:33,679
that feature of it it's only an
 

7967
02:10:33,679 --> 02:10:36,550
that feature of it it's only an
observable across time the term goal is

7968
02:10:36,550 --> 02:10:36,560
observable across time the term goal is
 

7969
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:38,550
observable across time the term goal is
such a

7970
02:10:38,550 --> 02:10:38,560
such a
 

7971
02:10:38,560 --> 02:10:40,709
such a
important and difficult to explain

7972
02:10:40,709 --> 02:10:40,719
important and difficult to explain
 

7973
02:10:40,719 --> 02:10:42,790
important and difficult to explain
concept right because what you want is a

7974
02:10:42,790 --> 02:10:42,800
concept right because what you want is a
 

7975
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:44,390
concept right because what you want is a
way is like um

7976
02:10:44,390 --> 02:10:44,400
way is like um
 

7977
02:10:44,400 --> 02:10:46,550
way is like um
i think only conscious beings can have

7978
02:10:46,550 --> 02:10:46,560
i think only conscious beings can have
 

7979
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:49,109
i think only conscious beings can have
conscious goals

7980
02:10:49,109 --> 02:10:49,119
conscious goals
 

7981
02:10:49,119 --> 02:10:51,430
conscious goals
everything else is doing selection

7982
02:10:51,430 --> 02:10:51,440
everything else is doing selection
 

7983
02:10:51,440 --> 02:10:53,510
everything else is doing selection
and but selection does invent goals and

7984
02:10:53,510 --> 02:10:53,520
and but selection does invent goals and
 

7985
02:10:53,520 --> 02:10:55,109
and but selection does invent goals and
in a way that um

7986
02:10:55,109 --> 02:10:55,119
in a way that um
 

7987
02:10:55,119 --> 02:10:57,350
in a way that um
the the way that biology reinterprets

7988
02:10:57,350 --> 02:10:57,360
the the way that biology reinterprets
 

7989
02:10:57,360 --> 02:11:01,350
the the way that biology reinterprets
the past in the present

7990
02:11:01,350 --> 02:11:01,360
the past in the present
 

7991
02:11:01,360 --> 02:11:03,350
the past in the present
is kind of how allows you to understand

7992
02:11:03,350 --> 02:11:03,360
is kind of how allows you to understand
 

7993
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:05,270
is kind of how allows you to understand
there was a goal in the past now right

7994
02:11:05,270 --> 02:11:05,280
there was a goal in the past now right
 

7995
02:11:05,280 --> 02:11:07,430
there was a goal in the past now right
it's kind of like goals only exist back

7996
02:11:07,430 --> 02:11:07,440
it's kind of like goals only exist back
 

7997
02:11:07,440 --> 02:11:09,189
it's kind of like goals only exist back
in time

7998
02:11:09,189 --> 02:11:09,199
in time
 

7999
02:11:09,199 --> 02:11:12,870
in time
so first of all um

8000
02:11:12,870 --> 02:11:12,880
so first of all um
 

8001
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:15,750
so first of all um
only conscious beings can have

8002
02:11:15,750 --> 02:11:15,760
only conscious beings can have
 

8003
02:11:15,760 --> 02:11:17,910
only conscious beings can have
conscious goals i'm not even going to

8004
02:11:17,910 --> 02:11:17,920
conscious goals i'm not even going to
 

8005
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:19,589
conscious goals i'm not even going to
touch that one

8006
02:11:19,589 --> 02:11:19,599
touch that one
 

8007
02:11:19,599 --> 02:11:20,390
touch that one
why

8008
02:11:20,390 --> 02:11:20,400
why
 

8009
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:21,589
why
well

8010
02:11:21,589 --> 02:11:21,599
well
 

8011
02:11:21,599 --> 02:11:23,669
well
go for it come on what what the line

8012
02:11:23,669 --> 02:11:23,679
go for it come on what what the line
 

8013
02:11:23,679 --> 02:11:26,390
go for it come on what what the line
between conscious goals and uh

8014
02:11:26,390 --> 02:11:26,400
between conscious goals and uh
 

8015
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:29,189
between conscious goals and uh
non-conscious goals exactly right and

8016
02:11:29,189 --> 02:11:29,199
non-conscious goals exactly right and
 

8017
02:11:29,199 --> 02:11:31,270
non-conscious goals exactly right and
also maybe just on top of that you said

8018
02:11:31,270 --> 02:11:31,280
also maybe just on top of that you said
 

8019
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:32,870
also maybe just on top of that you said
a touring test for gold directed

8020
02:11:32,870 --> 02:11:32,880
a touring test for gold directed
 

8021
02:11:32,880 --> 02:11:35,750
a touring test for gold directed
behavior what's what's what's it what's

8022
02:11:35,750 --> 02:11:35,760
behavior what's what's what's it what's
 

8023
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:37,510
behavior what's what's what's it what's
the turn what is the touring test

8024
02:11:37,510 --> 02:11:37,520
the turn what is the touring test
 

8025
02:11:37,520 --> 02:11:39,350
the turn what is the touring test
potentially look like so if you've got

8026
02:11:39,350 --> 02:11:39,360
potentially look like so if you've got
 

8027
02:11:39,360 --> 02:11:40,709
potentially look like so if you've got
two objects we were thinking about this

8028
02:11:40,709 --> 02:11:40,719
two objects we were thinking about this
 

8029
02:11:40,719 --> 02:11:42,709
two objects we were thinking about this
so we we actually got some funding to

8030
02:11:42,709 --> 02:11:42,719
so we we actually got some funding to
 

8031
02:11:42,719 --> 02:11:44,629
so we we actually got some funding to
work together two teams so

8032
02:11:44,629 --> 02:11:44,639
work together two teams so
 

8033
02:11:44,639 --> 02:11:46,310
work together two teams so
i'm trying to do in part of this is i'm

8034
02:11:46,310 --> 02:11:46,320
i'm trying to do in part of this is i'm
 

8035
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:48,069
i'm trying to do in part of this is i'm
trying to do a bit theory and sarah is

8036
02:11:48,069 --> 02:11:48,079
trying to do a bit theory and sarah is
 

8037
02:11:48,079 --> 02:11:50,069
trying to do a bit theory and sarah is
teaching me a bit of theory and sarah's

8038
02:11:50,069 --> 02:11:50,079
teaching me a bit of theory and sarah's
 

8039
02:11:50,079 --> 02:11:51,510
teaching me a bit of theory and sarah's
trying to design experiments and i'm

8040
02:11:51,510 --> 02:11:51,520
trying to design experiments and i'm
 

8041
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:52,470
trying to design experiments and i'm
teaching experiments because i think

8042
02:11:52,470 --> 02:11:52,480
teaching experiments because i think
 

8043
02:11:52,480 --> 02:11:53,589
teaching experiments because i think
it's really good for us to have that

8044
02:11:53,589 --> 02:11:53,599
it's really good for us to have that
 

8045
02:11:53,599 --> 02:11:55,270
it's really good for us to have that
just say

8046
02:11:55,270 --> 02:11:55,280
just say
 

8047
02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:57,830
just say
um when would a

8048
02:11:57,830 --> 02:11:57,840
um when would a
 

8049
02:11:57,840 --> 02:11:59,830
um when would a
so that's good i like this this i'm sure

8050
02:11:59,830 --> 02:11:59,840
so that's good i like this this i'm sure
 

8051
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:01,669
so that's good i like this this i'm sure
we use the dandenon essay right on

8052
02:12:01,669 --> 02:12:01,679
we use the dandenon essay right on
 

8053
02:12:01,679 --> 02:12:03,270
we use the dandenon essay right on
google yeah and i can explain why we

8054
02:12:03,270 --> 02:12:03,280
google yeah and i can explain why we
 

8055
02:12:03,280 --> 02:12:04,550
google yeah and i can explain why we
wouldn't want to call it a turing test

8056
02:12:04,550 --> 02:12:04,560
wouldn't want to call it a turing test
 

8057
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:06,629
wouldn't want to call it a turing test
after but yeah yeah so dan dalett wrote

8058
02:12:06,629 --> 02:12:06,639
after but yeah yeah so dan dalett wrote
 

8059
02:12:06,639 --> 02:12:09,430
after but yeah yeah so dan dalett wrote
this really nice essay about um

8060
02:12:09,430 --> 02:12:09,440
this really nice essay about um
 

8061
02:12:09,440 --> 02:12:12,550
this really nice essay about um
uh herding cats and free will inflation

8062
02:12:12,550 --> 02:12:12,560
uh herding cats and free will inflation
 

8063
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:14,310
uh herding cats and free will inflation
the title is so pretty it's the actual

8064
02:12:14,310 --> 02:12:14,320
the title is so pretty it's the actual
 

8065
02:12:14,320 --> 02:12:16,709
the title is so pretty it's the actual
title i think so hurting cats and free

8066
02:12:16,709 --> 02:12:16,719
title i think so hurting cats and free
 

8067
02:12:16,719 --> 02:12:18,870
title i think so hurting cats and free
will inflation yeah something like that

8068
02:12:18,870 --> 02:12:18,880
will inflation yeah something like that
 

8069
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:20,870
will inflation yeah something like that
i mean it's not maybe not and so no i

8070
02:12:20,870 --> 02:12:20,880
i mean it's not maybe not and so no i
 

8071
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:22,229
i mean it's not maybe not and so no i
think that's right so if you've got a

8072
02:12:22,229 --> 02:12:22,239
think that's right so if you've got a
 

8073
02:12:22,239 --> 02:12:23,910
think that's right so if you've got a
let's imagine you've got two objects on

8074
02:12:23,910 --> 02:12:23,920
let's imagine you've got two objects on
 

8075
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:25,589
let's imagine you've got two objects on
a hillside

8076
02:12:25,589 --> 02:12:25,599
a hillside
 

8077
02:12:25,599 --> 02:12:27,990
a hillside
okay and this happens to be a snowy hill

8078
02:12:27,990 --> 02:12:28,000
okay and this happens to be a snowy hill
 

8079
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:29,669
okay and this happens to be a snowy hill
and let's just say you see an object go

8080
02:12:29,669 --> 02:12:29,679
and let's just say you see an object go
 

8081
02:12:29,679 --> 02:12:31,270
and let's just say you see an object go
rolling down the hill

8082
02:12:31,270 --> 02:12:31,280
rolling down the hill
 

8083
02:12:31,280 --> 02:12:33,830
rolling down the hill
or you you you and the rocker rolls

8084
02:12:33,830 --> 02:12:33,840
or you you you and the rocker rolls
 

8085
02:12:33,840 --> 02:12:36,470
or you you you and the rocker rolls
downhill but the start goes to the end

8086
02:12:36,470 --> 02:12:36,480
downhill but the start goes to the end
 

8087
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:38,390
downhill but the start goes to the end
how do that objects had a goal now you

8088
02:12:38,390 --> 02:12:38,400
how do that objects had a goal now you
 

8089
02:12:38,400 --> 02:12:39,910
how do that objects had a goal now you
unveil the object and you'll see it's

8090
02:12:39,910 --> 02:12:39,920
unveil the object and you'll see it's
 

8091
02:12:39,920 --> 02:12:41,589
unveil the object and you'll see it's
actually a skier

8092
02:12:41,589 --> 02:12:41,599
actually a skier
 

8093
02:12:41,599 --> 02:12:43,030
actually a skier
and the skier starts the top and goes

8094
02:12:43,030 --> 02:12:43,040
and the skier starts the top and goes
 

8095
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:44,229
and the skier starts the top and goes
down the bottom

8096
02:12:44,229 --> 02:12:44,239
down the bottom
 

8097
02:12:44,239 --> 02:12:45,430
down the bottom
great

8098
02:12:45,430 --> 02:12:45,440
great
 

8099
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:47,030
great
then you look at the rock rock rolls

8100
02:12:47,030 --> 02:12:47,040
then you look at the rock rock rolls
 

8101
02:12:47,040 --> 02:12:48,950
then you look at the rock rock rolls
down the hill gets to the bottom how can

8102
02:12:48,950 --> 02:12:48,960
down the hill gets to the bottom how can
 

8103
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:51,109
down the hill gets to the bottom how can
you tell the difference between the two

8104
02:12:51,109 --> 02:12:51,119
you tell the difference between the two
 

8105
02:12:51,119 --> 02:12:53,589
you tell the difference between the two
so and what dan says is like well this

8106
02:12:53,589 --> 02:12:53,599
so and what dan says is like well this
 

8107
02:12:53,599 --> 02:12:56,149
so and what dan says is like well this
is clear the skier's in control

8108
02:12:56,149 --> 02:12:56,159
is clear the skier's in control
 

8109
02:12:56,159 --> 02:12:57,750
is clear the skier's in control
and the um because they're they're

8110
02:12:57,750 --> 02:12:57,760
and the um because they're they're
 

8111
02:12:57,760 --> 02:12:59,669
and the um because they're they're
adjusting trajectory so some updating

8112
02:12:59,669 --> 02:12:59,679
adjusting trajectory so some updating
 

8113
02:12:59,679 --> 02:13:01,189
adjusting trajectory so some updating
going on then the only way you can

8114
02:13:01,189 --> 02:13:01,199
going on then the only way you can
 

8115
02:13:01,199 --> 02:13:02,229
going on then the only way you can
really do that is you have to put the

8116
02:13:02,229 --> 02:13:02,239
really do that is you have to put the
 

8117
02:13:02,239 --> 02:13:04,069
really do that is you have to put the
skier back to the top of the hill again

8118
02:13:04,069 --> 02:13:04,079
skier back to the top of the hill again
 

8119
02:13:04,079 --> 02:13:05,430
skier back to the top of the hill again
they would tend to start roughly in the

8120
02:13:05,430 --> 02:13:05,440
they would tend to start roughly in the
 

8121
02:13:05,440 --> 02:13:07,350
they would tend to start roughly in the
same space and probably go

8122
02:13:07,350 --> 02:13:07,360
same space and probably go
 

8123
02:13:07,360 --> 02:13:08,870
same space and probably go
take all that that complex set of

8124
02:13:08,870 --> 02:13:08,880
take all that that complex set of
 

8125
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:10,709
take all that that complex set of
trajectories and end up pretty much at

8126
02:13:10,709 --> 02:13:10,719
trajectories and end up pretty much at
 

8127
02:13:10,719 --> 02:13:12,629
trajectories and end up pretty much at
the same finish point right with plus or

8128
02:13:12,629 --> 02:13:12,639
the same finish point right with plus or
 

8129
02:13:12,639 --> 02:13:14,310
the same finish point right with plus or
minus view mirrors whereas if it's just

8130
02:13:14,310 --> 02:13:14,320
minus view mirrors whereas if it's just
 

8131
02:13:14,320 --> 02:13:16,390
minus view mirrors whereas if it's just
a random rock going down random

8132
02:13:16,390 --> 02:13:16,400
a random rock going down random
 

8133
02:13:16,400 --> 02:13:18,470
a random rock going down random
trajectory that wouldn't happen and so

8134
02:13:18,470 --> 02:13:18,480
trajectory that wouldn't happen and so
 

8135
02:13:18,480 --> 02:13:20,310
trajectory that wouldn't happen and so
what sarah and i were kind of doing when

8136
02:13:20,310 --> 02:13:20,320
what sarah and i were kind of doing when
 

8137
02:13:20,320 --> 02:13:22,310
what sarah and i were kind of doing when
we were writing this grant we're like we

8138
02:13:22,310 --> 02:13:22,320
we were writing this grant we're like we
 

8139
02:13:22,320 --> 02:13:23,910
we were writing this grant we're like we
need to somehow

8140
02:13:23,910 --> 02:13:23,920
need to somehow
 

8141
02:13:23,920 --> 02:13:26,950
need to somehow
instantiate the skier and the rock in an

8142
02:13:26,950 --> 02:13:26,960
instantiate the skier and the rock in an
 

8143
02:13:26,960 --> 02:13:29,350
instantiate the skier and the rock in an
experiment and then say okay when does

8144
02:13:29,350 --> 02:13:29,360
experiment and then say okay when does
 

8145
02:13:29,360 --> 02:13:30,390
experiment and then say okay when does
the object

8146
02:13:30,390 --> 02:13:30,400
the object
 

8147
02:13:30,400 --> 02:13:31,990
the object
when it so

8148
02:13:31,990 --> 02:13:32,000
when it so
 

8149
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:33,510
when it so
for an object to have a goal it has to

8150
02:13:33,510 --> 02:13:33,520
for an object to have a goal it has to
 

8151
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:34,790
for an object to have a goal it has to
have an update it has to have some

8152
02:13:34,790 --> 02:13:34,800
have an update it has to have some
 

8153
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:36,950
have an update it has to have some
sensing and some kind of you know

8154
02:13:36,950 --> 02:13:36,960
sensing and some kind of you know
 

8155
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:40,310
sensing and some kind of you know
in-built actuation to respond to the

8156
02:13:40,310 --> 02:13:40,320
in-built actuation to respond to the
 

8157
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:42,550
in-built actuation to respond to the
environment and

8158
02:13:42,550 --> 02:13:42,560
environment and
 

8159
02:13:42,560 --> 02:13:43,990
environment and
and then we just have to iterate on that

8160
02:13:43,990 --> 02:13:44,000
and then we just have to iterate on that
 

8161
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:45,830
and then we just have to iterate on that
and maybe sarah you can then fill in the

8162
02:13:45,830 --> 02:13:45,840
and maybe sarah you can then fill in the
 

8163
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:48,149
and maybe sarah you can then fill in the
turing test part well yeah i guess the

8164
02:13:48,149 --> 02:13:48,159
turing test part well yeah i guess the
 

8165
02:13:48,159 --> 02:13:49,830
turing test part well yeah i guess the
motivation for me was slightly different

8166
02:13:49,830 --> 02:13:49,840
motivation for me was slightly different
 

8167
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:51,430
motivation for me was slightly different
so i i get really frustrated about

8168
02:13:51,430 --> 02:13:51,440
so i i get really frustrated about
 

8169
02:13:51,440 --> 02:13:52,870
so i i get really frustrated about
conversations about consciousness as

8170
02:13:52,870 --> 02:13:52,880
conversations about consciousness as
 

8171
02:13:52,880 --> 02:13:54,950
conversations about consciousness as
most people do um you know a lot of

8172
02:13:54,950 --> 02:13:54,960
most people do um you know a lot of
 

8173
02:13:54,960 --> 02:13:55,990
most people do um you know a lot of
people are

8174
02:13:55,990 --> 02:13:56,000
people are
 

8175
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:57,990
people are
which is not necessarily related to to

8176
02:13:57,990 --> 02:13:58,000
which is not necessarily related to to
 

8177
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,069
which is not necessarily related to to
free will directly or to this goal

8178
02:14:00,069 --> 02:14:00,079
free will directly or to this goal
 

8179
02:14:00,079 --> 02:14:02,069
free will directly or to this goal
directed behavior but i think there's a

8180
02:14:02,069 --> 02:14:02,079
directed behavior but i think there's a
 

8181
02:14:02,079 --> 02:14:03,830
directed behavior but i think there's a
whole set of bundled and related topics

8182
02:14:03,830 --> 02:14:03,840
whole set of bundled and related topics
 

8183
02:14:03,840 --> 02:14:06,870
whole set of bundled and related topics
here but i think for me i was you know

8184
02:14:06,870 --> 02:14:06,880
here but i think for me i was you know
 

8185
02:14:06,880 --> 02:14:08,709
here but i think for me i was you know
everybody's always interested in

8186
02:14:08,709 --> 02:14:08,719
everybody's always interested in
 

8187
02:14:08,719 --> 02:14:10,470
everybody's always interested in
explaining intrinsic experience and

8188
02:14:10,470 --> 02:14:10,480
explaining intrinsic experience and
 

8189
02:14:10,480 --> 02:14:12,310
explaining intrinsic experience and
quantifying intrinsic experience and

8190
02:14:12,310 --> 02:14:12,320
quantifying intrinsic experience and
 

8191
02:14:12,320 --> 02:14:14,629
quantifying intrinsic experience and
there's all sorts of problems with that

8192
02:14:14,629 --> 02:14:14,639
there's all sorts of problems with that
 

8193
02:14:14,639 --> 02:14:16,149
there's all sorts of problems with that
because you can never actually be

8194
02:14:16,149 --> 02:14:16,159
because you can never actually be
 

8195
02:14:16,159 --> 02:14:17,510
because you can never actually be
another physical system so you can't

8196
02:14:17,510 --> 02:14:17,520
another physical system so you can't
 

8197
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:18,550
another physical system so you can't
know what it's like to be another

8198
02:14:18,550 --> 02:14:18,560
know what it's like to be another
 

8199
02:14:18,560 --> 02:14:20,790
know what it's like to be another
physical system um so i always thought

8200
02:14:20,790 --> 02:14:20,800
physical system um so i always thought
 

8201
02:14:20,800 --> 02:14:21,990
physical system um so i always thought
there must be some way of getting at

8202
02:14:21,990 --> 02:14:22,000
there must be some way of getting at
 

8203
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:23,510
there must be some way of getting at
this problem about

8204
02:14:23,510 --> 02:14:23,520
this problem about
 

8205
02:14:23,520 --> 02:14:26,310
this problem about
if an agent or an entity is conscious or

8206
02:14:26,310 --> 02:14:26,320
if an agent or an entity is conscious or
 

8207
02:14:26,320 --> 02:14:28,629
if an agent or an entity is conscious or
at least has internal representations

8208
02:14:28,629 --> 02:14:28,639
at least has internal representations
 

8209
02:14:28,639 --> 02:14:30,950
at least has internal representations
and those are real physical things that

8210
02:14:30,950 --> 02:14:30,960
and those are real physical things that
 

8211
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:32,629
and those are real physical things that
they're it must

8212
02:14:32,629 --> 02:14:32,639
they're it must
 

8213
02:14:32,639 --> 02:14:34,550
they're it must
have causal consequences

8214
02:14:34,550 --> 02:14:34,560
have causal consequences
 

8215
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:37,430
have causal consequences
so the way i would ask the question of

8216
02:14:37,430 --> 02:14:37,440
so the way i would ask the question of
 

8217
02:14:37,440 --> 02:14:39,830
so the way i would ask the question of
consciousness is not you know what it is

8218
02:14:39,830 --> 02:14:39,840
consciousness is not you know what it is
 

8219
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:41,830
consciousness is not you know what it is
like intrinsically but if if things have

8220
02:14:41,830 --> 02:14:41,840
like intrinsically but if if things have
 

8221
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:43,510
like intrinsically but if if things have
intrinsic experience

8222
02:14:43,510 --> 02:14:43,520
intrinsic experience
 

8223
02:14:43,520 --> 02:14:45,030
intrinsic experience
is there any observable difference from

8224
02:14:45,030 --> 02:14:45,040
is there any observable difference from
 

8225
02:14:45,040 --> 02:14:47,030
is there any observable difference from
the outside about the the kind of

8226
02:14:47,030 --> 02:14:47,040
the outside about the the kind of
 

8227
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:48,870
the outside about the the kind of
causation that that physical system

8228
02:14:48,870 --> 02:14:48,880
causation that that physical system
 

8229
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:51,510
causation that that physical system
would enact in and for me the most

8230
02:14:51,510 --> 02:14:51,520
would enact in and for me the most
 

8231
02:14:51,520 --> 02:14:52,950
would enact in and for me the most
interesting thing that humans do is have

8232
02:14:52,950 --> 02:14:52,960
interesting thing that humans do is have
 

8233
02:14:52,960 --> 02:14:55,109
interesting thing that humans do is have
imagination so like we can imagine

8234
02:14:55,109 --> 02:14:55,119
imagination so like we can imagine
 

8235
02:14:55,119 --> 02:14:57,270
imagination so like we can imagine
rockets centuries before we build them

8236
02:14:57,270 --> 02:14:57,280
rockets centuries before we build them
 

8237
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:59,189
rockets centuries before we build them
they become real physical things because

8238
02:14:59,189 --> 02:14:59,199
they become real physical things because
 

8239
02:14:59,199 --> 02:15:01,030
they become real physical things because
we imagine them and people might

8240
02:15:01,030 --> 02:15:01,040
we imagine them and people might
 

8241
02:15:01,040 --> 02:15:02,310
we imagine them and people might
disentangle that from conscious

8242
02:15:02,310 --> 02:15:02,320
disentangle that from conscious
 

8243
02:15:02,320 --> 02:15:03,669
disentangle that from conscious
experience but i think a lot of the sort

8244
02:15:03,669 --> 02:15:03,679
experience but i think a lot of the sort
 

8245
02:15:03,679 --> 02:15:05,750
experience but i think a lot of the sort
of imagination we do is actually a

8246
02:15:05,750 --> 02:15:05,760
of imagination we do is actually a
 

8247
02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:08,229
of imagination we do is actually a
conscious process so then this becomes a

8248
02:15:08,229 --> 02:15:08,239
conscious process so then this becomes a
 

8249
02:15:08,239 --> 02:15:11,270
conscious process so then this becomes a
question of if i were observing systems

8250
02:15:11,270 --> 02:15:11,280
question of if i were observing systems
 

8251
02:15:11,280 --> 02:15:13,669
question of if i were observing systems
and i said one had an internal

8252
02:15:13,669 --> 02:15:13,679
and i said one had an internal
 

8253
02:15:13,679 --> 02:15:15,750
and i said one had an internal
representation which is slightly

8254
02:15:15,750 --> 02:15:15,760
representation which is slightly
 

8255
02:15:15,760 --> 02:15:17,270
representation which is slightly
different than a conscious experience

8256
02:15:17,270 --> 02:15:17,280
different than a conscious experience
 

8257
02:15:17,280 --> 02:15:18,629
different than a conscious experience
obviously so i'm entangling some

8258
02:15:18,629 --> 02:15:18,639
obviously so i'm entangling some
 

8259
02:15:18,639 --> 02:15:20,950
obviously so i'm entangling some
concepts but it's a loose set of thought

8260
02:15:20,950 --> 02:15:20,960
concepts but it's a loose set of thought
 

8261
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:23,910
concepts but it's a loose set of thought
experiments then how and i and i set

8262
02:15:23,910 --> 02:15:23,920
experiments then how and i and i set
 

8263
02:15:23,920 --> 02:15:26,229
experiments then how and i and i set
them up in a physically equivalent

8264
02:15:26,229 --> 02:15:26,239
them up in a physically equivalent
 

8265
02:15:26,239 --> 02:15:27,669
them up in a physically equivalent
situation

8266
02:15:27,669 --> 02:15:27,679
situation
 

8267
02:15:27,679 --> 02:15:30,149
situation
um would it be the case that

8268
02:15:30,149 --> 02:15:30,159
um would it be the case that
 

8269
02:15:30,159 --> 02:15:32,470
um would it be the case that
there would be

8270
02:15:32,470 --> 02:15:32,480
there would be
 

8271
02:15:32,480 --> 02:15:34,550
there would be
experimental observables associated with

8272
02:15:34,550 --> 02:15:34,560
experimental observables associated with
 

8273
02:15:34,560 --> 02:15:36,790
experimental observables associated with
it and that that became the idea of

8274
02:15:36,790 --> 02:15:36,800
it and that that became the idea of
 

8275
02:15:36,800 --> 02:15:38,229
it and that that became the idea of
trying to actually

8276
02:15:38,229 --> 02:15:38,239
trying to actually
 

8277
02:15:38,239 --> 02:15:39,669
trying to actually
measure for internal representation or

8278
02:15:39,669 --> 02:15:39,679
measure for internal representation or
 

8279
02:15:39,679 --> 02:15:41,669
measure for internal representation or
conscious so turing basically didn't

8280
02:15:41,669 --> 02:15:41,679
conscious so turing basically didn't
 

8281
02:15:41,679 --> 02:15:42,870
conscious so turing basically didn't
want to do that you just wanted the

8282
02:15:42,870 --> 02:15:42,880
want to do that you just wanted the
 

8283
02:15:42,880 --> 02:15:44,950
want to do that you just wanted the
machine that could emulate and trick you

8284
02:15:44,950 --> 02:15:44,960
machine that could emulate and trick you
 

8285
02:15:44,960 --> 02:15:46,950
machine that could emulate and trick you
into having the behavior but never dealt

8286
02:15:46,950 --> 02:15:46,960
into having the behavior but never dealt
 

8287
02:15:46,960 --> 02:15:49,510
into having the behavior but never dealt
with the internal experience because

8288
02:15:49,510 --> 02:15:49,520
with the internal experience because
 

8289
02:15:49,520 --> 02:15:51,350
with the internal experience because
he didn't know how to do that and i

8290
02:15:51,350 --> 02:15:51,360
he didn't know how to do that and i
 

8291
02:15:51,360 --> 02:15:53,669
he didn't know how to do that and i
guess i was wondering is there a way to

8292
02:15:53,669 --> 02:15:53,679
guess i was wondering is there a way to
 

8293
02:15:53,679 --> 02:15:55,669
guess i was wondering is there a way to
set up the experiment where you could

8294
02:15:55,669 --> 02:15:55,679
set up the experiment where you could
 

8295
02:15:55,679 --> 02:15:57,589
set up the experiment where you could
actually test for that

8296
02:15:57,589 --> 02:15:57,599
actually test for that
 

8297
02:15:57,599 --> 02:16:00,229
actually test for that
for imagination the blood

8298
02:16:00,229 --> 02:16:00,239
for imagination the blood
 

8299
02:16:00,239 --> 02:16:02,069
for imagination the blood
to the that there was something internal

8300
02:16:02,069 --> 02:16:02,079
to the that there was something internal
 

8301
02:16:02,079 --> 02:16:03,750
to the that there was something internal
going on some kind of

8302
02:16:03,750 --> 02:16:03,760
going on some kind of
 

8303
02:16:03,760 --> 02:16:06,629
going on some kind of
inner world as people say but i i or you

8304
02:16:06,629 --> 02:16:06,639
inner world as people say but i i or you
 

8305
02:16:06,639 --> 02:16:07,510
inner world as people say but i i or you
could say

8306
02:16:07,510 --> 02:16:07,520
could say
 

8307
02:16:07,520 --> 02:16:09,830
could say
you know like it actually is an agent

8308
02:16:09,830 --> 02:16:09,840
you know like it actually is an agent
 

8309
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:12,390
you know like it actually is an agent
it's making decisions it has an internal

8310
02:16:12,390 --> 02:16:12,400
it's making decisions it has an internal
 

8311
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:14,550
it's making decisions it has an internal
representation and whether you say

8312
02:16:14,550 --> 02:16:14,560
representation and whether you say
 

8313
02:16:14,560 --> 02:16:16,069
representation and whether you say
that's experience or not is a different

8314
02:16:16,069 --> 02:16:16,079
that's experience or not is a different
 

8315
02:16:16,079 --> 02:16:18,149
that's experience or not is a different
thing but at least the the feature that

8316
02:16:18,149 --> 02:16:18,159
thing but at least the the feature that
 

8317
02:16:18,159 --> 02:16:20,229
thing but at least the the feature that
there's some abstraction it's doing

8318
02:16:20,229 --> 02:16:20,239
there's some abstraction it's doing
 

8319
02:16:20,239 --> 02:16:22,229
there's some abstraction it's doing
that's not obvious from looking at the

8320
02:16:22,229 --> 02:16:22,239
that's not obvious from looking at the
 

8321
02:16:22,239 --> 02:16:23,750
that's not obvious from looking at the
physical substrates do you think it's

8322
02:16:23,750 --> 02:16:23,760
physical substrates do you think it's
 

8323
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:25,350
physical substrates do you think it's
possible to do that kind of thing one of

8324
02:16:25,350 --> 02:16:25,360
possible to do that kind of thing one of
 

8325
02:16:25,360 --> 02:16:26,709
possible to do that kind of thing one of
the compelling things about the turing

8326
02:16:26,709 --> 02:16:26,719
the compelling things about the turing
 

8327
02:16:26,719 --> 02:16:27,910
the compelling things about the turing
test

8328
02:16:27,910 --> 02:16:27,920
test
 

8329
02:16:27,920 --> 02:16:28,870
test
is that

8330
02:16:28,870 --> 02:16:28,880
is that
 

8331
02:16:28,880 --> 02:16:30,629
is that
you know defining intelligent defining

8332
02:16:30,629 --> 02:16:30,639
you know defining intelligent defining
 

8333
02:16:30,639 --> 02:16:32,549
you know defining intelligent defining
any complicated concept

8334
02:16:32,549 --> 02:16:32,559
any complicated concept
 

8335
02:16:32,559 --> 02:16:34,230
any complicated concept
as

8336
02:16:34,230 --> 02:16:34,240
as
 

8337
02:16:34,240 --> 02:16:36,870
as
um as a thing like observing it from the

8338
02:16:36,870 --> 02:16:36,880
um as a thing like observing it from the
 

8339
02:16:36,880 --> 02:16:38,950
um as a thing like observing it from the
surface and not caring about what's

8340
02:16:38,950 --> 02:16:38,960
surface and not caring about what's
 

8341
02:16:38,960 --> 02:16:41,509
surface and not caring about what's
going on deep inside because how do you

8342
02:16:41,509 --> 02:16:41,519
going on deep inside because how do you
 

8343
02:16:41,519 --> 02:16:42,469
going on deep inside because how do you
know

8344
02:16:42,469 --> 02:16:42,479
know
 

8345
02:16:42,479 --> 02:16:44,629
know
that's the point so the idea is exactly

8346
02:16:44,629 --> 02:16:44,639
that's the point so the idea is exactly
 

8347
02:16:44,639 --> 02:16:45,589
that's the point so the idea is exactly
that so

8348
02:16:45,589 --> 02:16:45,599
that so
 

8349
02:16:45,599 --> 02:16:46,790
that so
what we're trying to do the turing test

8350
02:16:46,790 --> 02:16:46,800
what we're trying to do the turing test
 

8351
02:16:46,800 --> 02:16:48,950
what we're trying to do the turing test
for goal directedness is literally

8352
02:16:48,950 --> 02:16:48,960
for goal directedness is literally
 

8353
02:16:48,960 --> 02:16:51,030
for goal directedness is literally
um take some objects that clearly don't

8354
02:16:51,030 --> 02:16:51,040
um take some objects that clearly don't
 

8355
02:16:51,040 --> 02:16:52,549
um take some objects that clearly don't
have any internal representation grains

8356
02:16:52,549 --> 02:16:52,559
have any internal representation grains
 

8357
02:16:52,559 --> 02:16:54,230
have any internal representation grains
of sand blowing on the beach or

8358
02:16:54,230 --> 02:16:54,240
of sand blowing on the beach or
 

8359
02:16:54,240 --> 02:16:55,750
of sand blowing on the beach or
something right

8360
02:16:55,750 --> 02:16:55,760
something right
 

8361
02:16:55,760 --> 02:16:58,150
something right
and i know a crab wandering around on

8362
02:16:58,150 --> 02:16:58,160
and i know a crab wandering around on
 

8363
02:16:58,160 --> 02:16:59,190
and i know a crab wandering around on
the beach

8364
02:16:59,190 --> 02:16:59,200
the beach
 

8365
02:16:59,200 --> 02:17:00,870
the beach
and then generating an experiment where

8366
02:17:00,870 --> 02:17:00,880
and then generating an experiment where
 

8367
02:17:00,880 --> 02:17:03,190
and then generating an experiment where
we literally the experiment generates an

8368
02:17:03,190 --> 02:17:03,200
we literally the experiment generates an
 

8369
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:05,509
we literally the experiment generates an
entity that literally has no internal

8370
02:17:05,509 --> 02:17:05,519
entity that literally has no internal

these are oil droplets actually we've

8374
02:17:08,950 --> 02:17:08,960
these are oil droplets actually we've
 

8375
02:17:08,960 --> 02:17:10,950
these are oil droplets actually we've
got in mind a robot that makes all

8376
02:17:10,950 --> 02:17:10,960
got in mind a robot that makes all
 

8377
02:17:10,960 --> 02:17:12,469
got in mind a robot that makes all
droplets but then what we want to try

8378
02:17:12,469 --> 02:17:12,479
droplets but then what we want to try
 

8379
02:17:12,479 --> 02:17:14,629
droplets but then what we want to try
and do is train the oil droplets to be

8380
02:17:14,629 --> 02:17:14,639
and do is train the oil droplets to be
 

8381
02:17:14,639 --> 02:17:15,990
and do is train the oil droplets to be
like crabs

8382
02:17:15,990 --> 02:17:16,000
like crabs
 

8383
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:17,990
like crabs
give them an internal representation

8384
02:17:17,990 --> 02:17:18,000
give them an internal representation
 

8385
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,389
give them an internal representation
give them the ability to

8386
02:17:20,389 --> 02:17:20,399
give them the ability to
 

8387
02:17:20,399 --> 02:17:21,750
give them the ability to
integrate information from the

8388
02:17:21,750 --> 02:17:21,760
integrate information from the
 

8389
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:24,070
integrate information from the
environment so they unders they remember

8390
02:17:24,070 --> 02:17:24,080
environment so they unders they remember
 

8391
02:17:24,080 --> 02:17:26,950
environment so they unders they remember
the past

8392
02:17:26,950 --> 02:17:26,960

 

8393
02:17:26,960 --> 02:17:28,629

are in the present

8394
02:17:28,629 --> 02:17:28,639
are in the present
 

8395
02:17:28,639 --> 02:17:30,870
are in the present
and can imagine a future

8396
02:17:30,870 --> 02:17:30,880
and can imagine a future
 

8397
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:32,870
and can imagine a future
and a very limited way their kind of

8398
02:17:32,870 --> 02:17:32,880
and a very limited way their kind of
 

8399
02:17:32,880 --> 02:17:35,030
and a very limited way their kind of
game engine their limited simulation of

8400
02:17:35,030 --> 02:17:35,040
game engine their limited simulation of
 

8401
02:17:35,040 --> 02:17:36,230
game engine their limited simulation of
the world

8402
02:17:36,230 --> 02:17:36,240
the world
 

8403
02:17:36,240 --> 02:17:38,309
the world
allows them to then make a decision your

8404
02:17:38,309 --> 02:17:38,319
allows them to then make a decision your
 

8405
02:17:38,319 --> 02:17:40,230
allows them to then make a decision your
objects across time

8406
02:17:40,230 --> 02:17:40,240
objects across time
 

8407
02:17:40,240 --> 02:17:42,870
objects across time
so then you would run a bunch of crabs

8408
02:17:42,870 --> 02:17:42,880
so then you would run a bunch of crabs
 

8409
02:17:42,880 --> 02:17:44,629
so then you would run a bunch of crabs
like over and over and over and over how

8410
02:17:44,629 --> 02:17:44,639
like over and over and over and over how
 

8411
02:17:44,639 --> 02:17:46,870
like over and over and over and over how
many crabs lee how many is that what

8412
02:17:46,870 --> 02:17:46,880
many crabs lee how many is that what
 

8413
02:17:46,880 --> 02:17:48,389
many crabs lee how many is that what
what's because you have to have a large

8414
02:17:48,389 --> 02:17:48,399
what's because you have to have a large
 

8415
02:17:48,399 --> 02:17:50,150
what's because you have to have a large
number of crabs what is

8416
02:17:50,150 --> 02:17:50,160
number of crabs what is
 

8417
02:17:50,160 --> 02:17:51,669
number of crabs what is
what does your theory say is there a

8418
02:17:51,669 --> 02:17:51,679
what does your theory say is there a
 

8419
02:17:51,679 --> 02:17:53,509
what does your theory say is there a
mathematical we're working on it i mean

8420
02:17:53,509 --> 02:17:53,519
mathematical we're working on it i mean
 

8421
02:17:53,519 --> 02:17:55,990
mathematical we're working on it i mean
this is limit crab limit there's

8422
02:17:55,990 --> 02:17:56,000
this is limit crab limit there's
 

8423
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,070
this is limit crab limit there's
literally a excellent there's lit

8424
02:17:58,070 --> 02:17:58,080
literally a excellent there's lit
 

8425
02:17:58,080 --> 02:17:59,589
literally a excellent there's lit
literally what's the herding cats have

8426
02:17:59,589 --> 02:17:59,599
literally what's the herding cats have
 

8427
02:17:59,599 --> 02:18:02,389
literally what's the herding cats have
to do oh that's random wait what's cats

8428
02:18:02,389 --> 02:18:02,399
to do oh that's random wait what's cats

hurting cats and the free will inflation

8432
02:18:06,709 --> 02:18:06,719
hurting cats and the free will inflation
 

8433
02:18:06,719 --> 02:18:08,950
hurting cats and the free will inflation
so um what does herding cats mean what

8434
02:18:08,950 --> 02:18:08,960
so um what does herding cats mean what
 

8435
02:18:08,960 --> 02:18:11,349
so um what does herding cats mean what
does free will inflation mean so this i

8436
02:18:11,349 --> 02:18:11,359
does free will inflation mean so this i
 

8437
02:18:11,359 --> 02:18:13,910
does free will inflation mean so this i
love this essay um because it explained

8438
02:18:13,910 --> 02:18:13,920
love this essay um because it explained
 

8439
02:18:13,920 --> 02:18:15,190
love this essay um because it explained
to me how i could live in a

8440
02:18:15,190 --> 02:18:15,200
to me how i could live in a
 

8441
02:18:15,200 --> 02:18:17,669
to me how i could live in a
deterministic universe

8442
02:18:17,669 --> 02:18:17,679
deterministic universe
 

8443
02:18:17,679 --> 02:18:19,429
deterministic universe
um but

8444
02:18:19,429 --> 02:18:19,439
um but
 

8445
02:18:19,439 --> 02:18:20,549
um but
have

8446
02:18:20,549 --> 02:18:20,559
have
 

8447
02:18:20,559 --> 02:18:23,030
have
not free will but have freedom you know

8448
02:18:23,030 --> 02:18:23,040
not free will but have freedom you know
 

8449
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:26,150
not free will but have freedom you know
um and beca and also it helped me

8450
02:18:26,150 --> 02:18:26,160
um and beca and also it helped me
 

8451
02:18:26,160 --> 02:18:27,349
um and beca and also it helped me
explain that

8452
02:18:27,349 --> 02:18:27,359
explain that
 

8453
02:18:27,359 --> 02:18:29,669
explain that
that time needed to be a real thing in

8454
02:18:29,669 --> 02:18:29,679
that time needed to be a real thing in
 

8455
02:18:29,679 --> 02:18:32,070
that time needed to be a real thing in
this universe so what basically dan was

8456
02:18:32,070 --> 02:18:32,080
this universe so what basically dan was
 

8457
02:18:32,080 --> 02:18:34,870
this universe so what basically dan was
saying here is like um how do you how do

8458
02:18:34,870 --> 02:18:34,880
saying here is like um how do you how do
 

8459
02:18:34,880 --> 02:18:36,309
saying here is like um how do you how do
these cats appear to just do what they

8460
02:18:36,309 --> 02:18:36,319
these cats appear to just do what they
 

8461
02:18:36,319 --> 02:18:37,509
these cats appear to just do what they
want

8462
02:18:37,509 --> 02:18:37,519
want
 

8463
02:18:37,519 --> 02:18:39,830
want
right and how if you live in a

8464
02:18:39,830 --> 02:18:39,840
right and how if you live in a
 

8465
02:18:39,840 --> 02:18:41,830
right and how if you live in a
deterministic universe why do the cats

8466
02:18:41,830 --> 02:18:41,840
deterministic universe why do the cats
 

8467
02:18:41,840 --> 02:18:43,669
deterministic universe why do the cats
do these things you know aren't they

8468
02:18:43,669 --> 02:18:43,679
do these things you know aren't they
 

8469
02:18:43,679 --> 02:18:45,349
do these things you know aren't they
just isn't it all obvious

8470
02:18:45,349 --> 02:18:45,359
just isn't it all obvious
 

8471
02:18:45,359 --> 02:18:47,669
just isn't it all obvious
um and how does free will inflate the

8472
02:18:47,669 --> 02:18:47,679
um and how does free will inflate the
 

8473
02:18:47,679 --> 02:18:49,589
um and how does free will inflate the
universe and for me

8474
02:18:49,589 --> 02:18:49,599
universe and for me
 

8475
02:18:49,599 --> 02:18:51,669
universe and for me
i mean probably i love the essay because

8476
02:18:51,669 --> 02:18:51,679
i mean probably i love the essay because
 

8477
02:18:51,679 --> 02:18:53,830
i mean probably i love the essay because
my interpretation of the essay in

8478
02:18:53,830 --> 02:18:53,840
my interpretation of the essay in
 

8479
02:18:53,840 --> 02:18:56,309
my interpretation of the essay in
assembly theory makes complete sense

8480
02:18:56,309 --> 02:18:56,319
assembly theory makes complete sense
 

8481
02:18:56,319 --> 02:18:57,429
assembly theory makes complete sense
um

8482
02:18:57,429 --> 02:18:57,439
um
 

8483
02:18:57,439 --> 02:18:58,389
um
because

8484
02:18:58,389 --> 02:18:58,399
because
 

8485
02:18:58,399 --> 02:19:00,549
because
you need an expanding universe in

8486
02:19:00,549 --> 02:19:00,559
you need an expanding universe in
 

8487
02:19:00,559 --> 02:19:02,230
you need an expanding universe in
assembly theory

8488
02:19:02,230 --> 02:19:02,240
assembly theory
 

8489
02:19:02,240 --> 02:19:04,629
assembly theory
to create novelty

8490
02:19:04,629 --> 02:19:04,639
to create novelty
 

8491
02:19:04,639 --> 02:19:06,389
to create novelty
that you search

8492
02:19:06,389 --> 02:19:06,399
that you search
 

8493
02:19:06,399 --> 02:19:08,309
that you search
for that then when you find something

8494
02:19:08,309 --> 02:19:08,319
for that then when you find something
 

8495
02:19:08,319 --> 02:19:09,669
for that then when you find something
interesting and you keep doing it

8496
02:19:09,669 --> 02:19:09,679
interesting and you keep doing it
 

8497
02:19:09,679 --> 02:19:11,349
interesting and you keep doing it
because it's cool and it gives you an

8498
02:19:11,349 --> 02:19:11,359
because it's cool and it gives you an
 

8499
02:19:11,359 --> 02:19:13,110
because it's cool and it gives you an
advantage

8500
02:19:13,110 --> 02:19:13,120
advantage
 

8501
02:19:13,120 --> 02:19:15,349
advantage
then it appears in the past to be a goal

8502
02:19:15,349 --> 02:19:15,359
then it appears in the past to be a goal
 

8503
02:19:15,359 --> 02:19:17,190
then it appears in the past to be a goal
so what what does in assembly theory the

8504
02:19:17,190 --> 02:19:17,200
so what what does in assembly theory the
 

8505
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:18,950
so what what does in assembly theory the
expansion of the universe

8506
02:19:18,950 --> 02:19:18,960
expansion of the universe
 

8507
02:19:18,960 --> 02:19:20,709
expansion of the universe
look like

8508
02:19:20,709 --> 02:19:20,719
look like
 

8509
02:19:20,719 --> 02:19:22,150
look like
what are we what are we talking about

8510
02:19:22,150 --> 02:19:22,160
what are we what are we talking about
 

8511
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:24,230
what are we what are we talking about
why is why

8512
02:19:24,230 --> 02:19:24,240
why is why
 

8513
02:19:24,240 --> 02:19:26,950
why is why
why does the expansion universe give you

8514
02:19:26,950 --> 02:19:26,960
why does the expansion universe give you
 

8515
02:19:26,960 --> 02:19:29,190
why does the expansion universe give you
more possibilities of novelty and cool

8516
02:19:29,190 --> 02:19:29,200
more possibilities of novelty and cool
 

8517
02:19:29,200 --> 02:19:30,309
more possibilities of novelty and cool
stuff

8518
02:19:30,309 --> 02:19:30,319
stuff
 

8519
02:19:30,319 --> 02:19:31,750
stuff
so for me i don't think about the

8520
02:19:31,750 --> 02:19:31,760
so for me i don't think about the
 

8521
02:19:31,760 --> 02:19:34,150
so for me i don't think about the
universe in terms of big bang in space i

8522
02:19:34,150 --> 02:19:34,160
universe in terms of big bang in space i
 

8523
02:19:34,160 --> 02:19:36,230
universe in terms of big bang in space i
think about in terms of the big the big

8524
02:19:36,230 --> 02:19:36,240
think about in terms of the big the big
 

8525
02:19:36,240 --> 02:19:38,549
think about in terms of the big the big
memory expansion that you have one you

8526
02:19:38,549 --> 02:19:38,559
memory expansion that you have one you
 

8527
02:19:38,559 --> 02:19:40,070
memory expansion that you have one you
only have the ability to store one bit

8528
02:19:40,070 --> 02:19:40,080
only have the ability to store one bit
 

8529
02:19:40,080 --> 02:19:42,150
only have the ability to store one bit
of information so then you can't do very

8530
02:19:42,150 --> 02:19:42,160
of information so then you can't do very
 

8531
02:19:42,160 --> 02:19:44,230
of information so then you can't do very
much so what the universe has been doing

8532
02:19:44,230 --> 02:19:44,240
much so what the universe has been doing
 

8533
02:19:44,240 --> 02:19:46,870
much so what the universe has been doing
since the since forever it's been

8534
02:19:46,870 --> 02:19:46,880
since the since forever it's been
 

8535
02:19:46,880 --> 02:19:48,870
since the since forever it's been
creating more

8536
02:19:48,870 --> 02:19:48,880
creating more
 

8537
02:19:48,880 --> 02:19:52,469
creating more
it's been increasing the size of its ram

8538
02:19:52,469 --> 02:19:52,479
it's been increasing the size of its ram
 

8539
02:19:52,479 --> 02:19:54,790
it's been increasing the size of its ram
okay so it's like one megabyte two

8540
02:19:54,790 --> 02:19:54,800
okay so it's like one megabyte two
 

8541
02:19:54,800 --> 02:19:56,469
okay so it's like one megabyte two
megabytes three megabytes four megabytes

8542
02:19:56,469 --> 02:19:56,479
megabytes three megabytes four megabytes
 

8543
02:19:56,479 --> 02:19:58,389
megabytes three megabytes four megabytes
all the way up and so

8544
02:19:58,389 --> 02:19:58,399
all the way up and so
 

8545
02:19:58,399 --> 02:20:00,550
all the way up and so
the more ram you have

8546
02:20:00,550 --> 02:20:00,560
the more ram you have
 

8547
02:20:00,560 --> 02:20:04,150
the more ram you have
the more you can remember about the past

8548
02:20:04,150 --> 02:20:04,160
the more you can remember about the past
 

8549
02:20:04,160 --> 02:20:05,670
the more you can remember about the past
then which allows you to do cooler

8550
02:20:05,670 --> 02:20:05,680
then which allows you to do cooler
 

8551
02:20:05,680 --> 02:20:07,670
then which allows you to do cooler
things in the future so if you can

8552
02:20:07,670 --> 02:20:07,680
things in the future so if you can
 

8553
02:20:07,680 --> 02:20:09,750
things in the future so if you can
remember how to launch a rocket then you

8554
02:20:09,750 --> 02:20:09,760
remember how to launch a rocket then you
 

8555
02:20:09,760 --> 02:20:11,510
remember how to launch a rocket then you
might be able to imagine how to land a

8556
02:20:11,510 --> 02:20:11,520
might be able to imagine how to land a
 

8557
02:20:11,520 --> 02:20:12,469
might be able to imagine how to land a
rocket

8558
02:20:12,469 --> 02:20:12,479
rocket
 

8559
02:20:12,479 --> 02:20:14,469
rocket
and then re-launch re-land and carry on

8560
02:20:14,469 --> 02:20:14,479
and then re-launch re-land and carry on
 

8561
02:20:14,479 --> 02:20:16,710
and then re-launch re-land and carry on
because and so the the

8562
02:20:16,710 --> 02:20:16,720
because and so the the
 

8563
02:20:16,720 --> 02:20:19,590
because and so the the
you able you're able to expand the space

8564
02:20:19,590 --> 02:20:19,600
you able you're able to expand the space
 

8565
02:20:19,600 --> 02:20:21,910
you able you're able to expand the space
and remember the past and so that's why

8566
02:20:21,910 --> 02:20:21,920
and remember the past and so that's why
 

8567
02:20:21,920 --> 02:20:23,910
and remember the past and so that's why
i think it's very important but not a

8568
02:20:23,910 --> 02:20:23,920
i think it's very important but not a
 

8569
02:20:23,920 --> 02:20:26,150
i think it's very important but not a
perfect memory it's it's a it's an

8570
02:20:26,150 --> 02:20:26,160
perfect memory it's it's a it's an
 

8571
02:20:26,160 --> 02:20:27,590
perfect memory it's it's a it's an
interesting question whether there's

8572
02:20:27,590 --> 02:20:27,600
interesting question whether there's
 

8573
02:20:27,600 --> 02:20:29,110
interesting question whether there's
some forgetting that happens it might

8574
02:20:29,110 --> 02:20:29,120
some forgetting that happens it might
 

8575
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:30,389
some forgetting that happens it might
increase

8576
02:20:30,389 --> 02:20:30,399
increase
 

8577
02:20:30,399 --> 02:20:32,309
increase
is the expansion of the

8578
02:20:32,309 --> 02:20:32,319
is the expansion of the
 

8579
02:20:32,319 --> 02:20:34,710
is the expansion of the
forgetting at some point accelerate

8580
02:20:34,710 --> 02:20:34,720
forgetting at some point accelerate
 

8581
02:20:34,720 --> 02:20:35,830
forgetting at some point accelerate
faster than

8582
02:20:35,830 --> 02:20:35,840
faster than
 

8583
02:20:35,840 --> 02:20:37,910
faster than
the remembering i think that that's a

8584
02:20:37,910 --> 02:20:37,920
the remembering i think that that's a
 

8585
02:20:37,920 --> 02:20:39,750
the remembering i think that that's a
very important thing that probably

8586
02:20:39,750 --> 02:20:39,760
very important thing that probably
 

8587
02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:41,030
very important thing that probably
intelligence does and we're going to

8588
02:20:41,030 --> 02:20:41,040
intelligence does and we're going to
 

8589
02:20:41,040 --> 02:20:42,389
intelligence does and we're going to
learn in machine learning about because

8590
02:20:42,389 --> 02:20:42,399
learn in machine learning about because
 

8591
02:20:42,399 --> 02:20:44,469
learn in machine learning about because
you want machine learning right now or

8592
02:20:44,469 --> 02:20:44,479
you want machine learning right now or
 

8593
02:20:44,479 --> 02:20:45,670
you want machine learning right now or
artificial intelligence right now it

8594
02:20:45,670 --> 02:20:45,680
artificial intelligence right now it
 

8595
02:20:45,680 --> 02:20:47,510
artificial intelligence right now it
doesn't have memory right but you want

8596
02:20:47,510 --> 02:20:47,520
doesn't have memory right but you want
 

8597
02:20:47,520 --> 02:20:48,950
doesn't have memory right but you want
the ability to

8598
02:20:48,950 --> 02:20:48,960
the ability to
 

8599
02:20:48,960 --> 02:20:51,030
the ability to
or not for if you want to get to

8600
02:20:51,030 --> 02:20:51,040
or not for if you want to get to
 

8601
02:20:51,040 --> 02:20:53,110
or not for if you want to get to
human-like consciousness you need to

8602
02:20:53,110 --> 02:20:53,120
human-like consciousness you need to
 

8603
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:54,950
human-like consciousness you need to
have the ability i suppose to remember

8604
02:20:54,950 --> 02:20:54,960
have the ability i suppose to remember
 

8605
02:20:54,960 --> 02:20:56,710
have the ability i suppose to remember
stuff and then to selectively forget

8606
02:20:56,710 --> 02:20:56,720
stuff and then to selectively forget
 

8607
02:20:56,720 --> 02:20:58,389
stuff and then to selectively forget
stuff so you can re-remember it and

8608
02:20:58,389 --> 02:20:58,399
stuff so you can re-remember it and
 

8609
02:20:58,399 --> 02:21:00,550
stuff so you can re-remember it and
compress it arguably the way that we

8610
02:21:00,550 --> 02:21:00,560
compress it arguably the way that we
 

8611
02:21:00,560 --> 02:21:03,030
compress it arguably the way that we
come up with new physical laws

8612
02:21:03,030 --> 02:21:03,040
come up with new physical laws
 

8613
02:21:03,040 --> 02:21:04,630
come up with new physical laws
yeah you like it that's it for that yeah

8614
02:21:04,630 --> 02:21:04,640
yeah you like it that's it for that yeah
 

8615
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:05,990
yeah you like it that's it for that yeah
sorry you were confronted no no that's

8616
02:21:05,990 --> 02:21:06,000
sorry you were confronted no no that's
 

8617
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:07,750
sorry you were confronted no no that's
all right no i just wanted it i i think

8618
02:21:07,750 --> 02:21:07,760
all right no i just wanted it i i think
 

8619
02:21:07,760 --> 02:21:08,710
all right no i just wanted it i i think
that um

8620
02:21:08,710 --> 02:21:08,720
that um
 

8621
02:21:08,720 --> 02:21:09,830
that um
there is a

8622
02:21:09,830 --> 02:21:09,840
there is a
 

8623
02:21:09,840 --> 02:21:13,510
there is a
a great deal to be gained from having

8624
02:21:13,510 --> 02:21:13,520
a great deal to be gained from having
 

8625
02:21:13,520 --> 02:21:16,469
a great deal to be gained from having
the ability to remember things but then

8626
02:21:16,469 --> 02:21:16,479
the ability to remember things but then
 

8627
02:21:16,479 --> 02:21:18,790
the ability to remember things but then
when you forget them you can then have a

8628
02:21:18,790 --> 02:21:18,800
when you forget them you can then have a
 

8629
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:20,150
when you forget them you can then have a
you can basically do the simulation

8630
02:21:20,150 --> 02:21:20,160
you can basically do the simulation
 

8631
02:21:20,160 --> 02:21:21,750
you can basically do the simulation
again and work out if you get to that

8632
02:21:21,750 --> 02:21:21,760
again and work out if you get to that
 

8633
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:23,750
again and work out if you get to that
compressed representation

8634
02:21:23,750 --> 02:21:23,760
compressed representation
 

8635
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:26,790
compressed representation
so that it's in cycles so cycles of

8636
02:21:26,790 --> 02:21:26,800
so that it's in cycles so cycles of
 

8637
02:21:26,800 --> 02:21:29,429
so that it's in cycles so cycles of
memory remembering and and forgetting

8638
02:21:29,429 --> 02:21:29,439
memory remembering and and forgetting
 

8639
02:21:29,439 --> 02:21:31,110
memory remembering and and forgetting
are probably important but there

8640
02:21:31,110 --> 02:21:31,120
are probably important but there
 

8641
02:21:31,120 --> 02:21:32,630
are probably important but there
shouldn't be excuse to

8642
02:21:32,630 --> 02:21:32,640
shouldn't be excuse to
 

8643
02:21:32,640 --> 02:21:34,389
shouldn't be excuse to
have a universe with no memory in it the

8644

universe is going to remember that it
 

8647
02:21:36,319 --> 02:21:40,150
universe is going to remember that it
forgot but just not tell you

8648
02:21:40,150 --> 02:21:40,160
forgot but just not tell you

i'm i'm looking at the this paper and

8650
02:21:42,309 --> 02:21:42,319
i'm i'm looking at the this paper and
 

8651
02:21:42,319 --> 02:21:44,150
i'm i'm looking at the this paper and
it's talking about a puppet controlling

8652
02:21:44,150 --> 02:21:44,160
it's talking about a puppet controlling
 

8653
02:21:44,160 --> 02:21:45,510
it's talking about a puppet controlling

easy to understand but physically

8660
02:21:49,990 --> 02:21:50,000
easy to understand but physically
 

8661
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:51,590

8665
02:21:53,760 --> 02:21:55,670
predicting a fair coin toss i don't know
what he's talking about but there's

8666
02:21:55,670 --> 02:21:55,680
what he's talking about but there's
 

8667
02:21:55,680 --> 02:21:57,910
what he's talking about but there's
pictures of puppets controlling puppets

8668
02:21:57,910 --> 02:21:57,920
pictures of puppets controlling puppets
 

8669
02:21:57,920 --> 02:22:00,309
pictures of puppets controlling puppets
um let me ask you there's a there's a

8670
02:22:00,309 --> 02:22:00,319
um let me ask you there's a there's a
 

8671
02:22:00,319 --> 02:22:02,469
um let me ask you there's a there's a
few things i want to ask but we brought

8672
02:22:02,469 --> 02:22:02,479
few things i want to ask but we brought
 

8673
02:22:02,479 --> 02:22:04,550
few things i want to ask but we brought
up time quite a bit

8674
02:22:04,550 --> 02:22:04,560
up time quite a bit
 

8675
02:22:04,560 --> 02:22:08,389
up time quite a bit
you guys tweet about time quite a bit

8676
02:22:08,389 --> 02:22:08,399
you guys tweet about time quite a bit
 

8677
02:22:08,399 --> 02:22:10,950
you guys tweet about time quite a bit
uh what is time in all this we kind of

8678
02:22:10,950 --> 02:22:10,960
uh what is time in all this we kind of
 

8679
02:22:10,960 --> 02:22:12,630
uh what is time in all this we kind of
mentioned it a bunch

8680
02:22:12,630 --> 02:22:12,640
mentioned it a bunch
 

8681
02:22:12,640 --> 02:22:15,030
mentioned it a bunch
um is it not important at all in terms

8682
02:22:15,030 --> 02:22:15,040
um is it not important at all in terms
 

8683
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:17,270
um is it not important at all in terms
of uh is it just a word should we be

8684
02:22:17,270 --> 02:22:17,280
of uh is it just a word should we be
 

8685
02:22:17,280 --> 02:22:19,110
of uh is it just a word should we be
talking about causality mostly like sir

8686
02:22:19,110 --> 02:22:19,120
talking about causality mostly like sir
 

8687
02:22:19,120 --> 02:22:20,230
talking about causality mostly like sir
what do you think

8688
02:22:20,230 --> 02:22:20,240
what do you think
 

8689
02:22:20,240 --> 02:22:23,990
what do you think
is uh we've talked about like memories

8690
02:22:23,990 --> 02:22:24,000
is uh we've talked about like memories
 

8691
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:25,510
is uh we've talked about like memories
is that the fundamental thing that we

8692
02:22:25,510 --> 02:22:25,520
is that the fundamental thing that we
 

8693
02:22:25,520 --> 02:22:27,590
is that the fundamental thing that we
should be thinking about and and time is

8694
02:22:27,590 --> 02:22:27,600
should be thinking about and and time is
 

8695
02:22:27,600 --> 02:22:29,349
should be thinking about and and time is
just a useful measurement device or

8696
02:22:29,349 --> 02:22:29,359
just a useful measurement device or
 

8697
02:22:29,359 --> 02:22:30,790
just a useful measurement device or
something like that well there's

8698
02:22:30,790 --> 02:22:30,800
something like that well there's
 

8699
02:22:30,800 --> 02:22:32,630
something like that well there's
different concepts of time right so i

8700
02:22:32,630 --> 02:22:32,640
different concepts of time right so i
 

8701
02:22:32,640 --> 02:22:33,830
different concepts of time right so i
think in assembly theory when we're

8702
02:22:33,830 --> 02:22:33,840
think in assembly theory when we're
 

8703
02:22:33,840 --> 02:22:34,790
think in assembly theory when we're
talking about time we're talking about

8704
02:22:34,790 --> 02:22:34,800
talking about time we're talking about
 

8705
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:36,790
talking about time we're talking about
the ordering of things so that's the

8706
02:22:36,790 --> 02:22:36,800
the ordering of things so that's the
 

8707
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:39,429
the ordering of things so that's the
causal graph part and so then the

8708
02:22:39,429 --> 02:22:39,439
causal graph part and so then the
 

8709
02:22:39,439 --> 02:22:40,710
causal graph part and so then the
fundamental structure of the universe is

8710
02:22:40,710 --> 02:22:40,720
fundamental structure of the universe is
 

8711
02:22:40,720 --> 02:22:42,630
fundamental structure of the universe is
that there is a certain ordering

8712
02:22:42,630 --> 02:22:42,640
that there is a certain ordering
 

8713
02:22:42,640 --> 02:22:43,750
that there is a certain ordering
and certain things can't happen till

8714
02:22:43,750 --> 02:22:43,760
and certain things can't happen till
 

8715
02:22:43,760 --> 02:22:45,349
and certain things can't happen till
other things happen but usually when we

8716
02:22:45,349 --> 02:22:45,359
other things happen but usually when we
 

8717
02:22:45,359 --> 02:22:47,830
other things happen but usually when we
colloquially attack colloquially talk

8718
02:22:47,830 --> 02:22:47,840
colloquially attack colloquially talk
 

8719
02:22:47,840 --> 02:22:49,270
colloquially attack colloquially talk
about time we're talking about the flow

8720
02:22:49,270 --> 02:22:49,280
about time we're talking about the flow
 

8721
02:22:49,280 --> 02:22:51,270
about time we're talking about the flow
of time um

8722
02:22:51,270 --> 02:22:51,280
of time um
 

8723
02:22:51,280 --> 02:22:52,550
of time um
and i guess lee and i were actually

8724
02:22:52,550 --> 02:22:52,560
and i guess lee and i were actually
 

8725
02:22:52,560 --> 02:22:54,950
and i guess lee and i were actually
debating about this this morning so and

8726
02:22:54,950 --> 02:22:54,960
debating about this this morning so and
 

8727
02:22:54,960 --> 02:22:56,550
debating about this this morning so and
talking on it walking on the river here

8728
02:22:56,550 --> 02:22:56,560
talking on it walking on the river here
 

8729
02:22:56,560 --> 02:22:58,230
talking on it walking on the river here
which is a very lovely spot for talking

8730
02:22:58,230 --> 02:22:58,240
which is a very lovely spot for talking
 

8731
02:22:58,240 --> 02:23:01,270
which is a very lovely spot for talking
about time um but that the you know that

8732
02:23:01,270 --> 02:23:01,280
about time um but that the you know that
 

8733
02:23:01,280 --> 02:23:02,710
about time um but that the you know that
when the universe is updating it's

8734
02:23:02,710 --> 02:23:02,720
when the universe is updating it's
 

8735
02:23:02,720 --> 02:23:04,710
when the universe is updating it's
transitioning between

8736
02:23:04,710 --> 02:23:04,720
transitioning between
 

8737
02:23:04,720 --> 02:23:06,150
transitioning between
things that exist now and things that

8738
02:23:06,150 --> 02:23:06,160
things that exist now and things that
 

8739
02:23:06,160 --> 02:23:09,030
things that exist now and things that
exist now

8740
02:23:09,030 --> 02:23:09,040

 

8741
02:23:09,040 --> 02:23:11,510

that's really the flow of time

8742
02:23:11,510 --> 02:23:11,520
that's really the flow of time
 

8743
02:23:11,520 --> 02:23:13,030
that's really the flow of time
so there's there's

8744
02:23:13,030 --> 02:23:13,040
so there's there's
 

8745
02:23:13,040 --> 02:23:14,790
so there's there's
you have to separate out those concepts

8746
02:23:14,790 --> 02:23:14,800
you have to separate out those concepts
 

8747
02:23:14,800 --> 02:23:16,389
you have to separate out those concepts
at bare minimum and then there's also an

8748
02:23:16,389 --> 02:23:16,399
at bare minimum and then there's also an
 

8749
02:23:16,399 --> 02:23:18,710
at bare minimum and then there's also an
arrow of time that people talk about in

8750
02:23:18,710 --> 02:23:18,720
arrow of time that people talk about in
 

8751
02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:20,550
arrow of time that people talk about in
physics which is that time doesn't

8752
02:23:20,550 --> 02:23:20,560
physics which is that time doesn't
 

8753
02:23:20,560 --> 02:23:21,830
physics which is that time doesn't
appear to have a directionality in

8754
02:23:21,830 --> 02:23:21,840
appear to have a directionality in
 

8755
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:24,790
appear to have a directionality in
fundamental physics but it does um to us

8756
02:23:24,790 --> 02:23:24,800
fundamental physics but it does um to us
 

8757
02:23:24,800 --> 02:23:26,630
fundamental physics but it does um to us
right like we can't go backwards in time

8758
02:23:26,630 --> 02:23:26,640
right like we can't go backwards in time
 

8759
02:23:26,640 --> 02:23:28,230
right like we can't go backwards in time
and usually we you know that would be

8760
02:23:28,230 --> 02:23:28,240
and usually we you know that would be
 

8761
02:23:28,240 --> 02:23:30,630
and usually we you know that would be
explained in physics in terms of um well

8762
02:23:30,630 --> 02:23:30,640
explained in physics in terms of um well
 

8763
02:23:30,640 --> 02:23:32,070
explained in physics in terms of um well
there's a cosmological arrow of time but

8764
02:23:32,070 --> 02:23:32,080
there's a cosmological arrow of time but
 

8765
02:23:32,080 --> 02:23:33,510
there's a cosmological arrow of time but
there's also the thermodynamic arrow of

8766
02:23:33,510 --> 02:23:33,520
there's also the thermodynamic arrow of
 

8767
02:23:33,520 --> 02:23:35,349
there's also the thermodynamic arrow of
time of increasing entropy

8768
02:23:35,349 --> 02:23:35,359
time of increasing entropy
 

8769
02:23:35,359 --> 02:23:37,429
time of increasing entropy
um but what we would say in assembly

8770
02:23:37,429 --> 02:23:37,439
um but what we would say in assembly
 

8771
02:23:37,439 --> 02:23:38,550
um but what we would say in assembly
theory is that there is a clear

8772
02:23:38,550 --> 02:23:38,560
theory is that there is a clear
 

8773
02:23:38,560 --> 02:23:40,230
theory is that there is a clear
directionality the universe only runs in

8774
02:23:40,230 --> 02:23:40,240
directionality the universe only runs in
 

8775
02:23:40,240 --> 02:23:41,910
directionality the universe only runs in
one direction which is why some things

8776
02:23:41,910 --> 02:23:41,920
one direction which is why some things
 

8777
02:23:41,920 --> 02:23:43,510
one direction which is why some things
it's easy to make if the universe ones

8778
02:23:43,510 --> 02:23:43,520
it's easy to make if the universe ones
 

8779
02:23:43,520 --> 02:23:45,830
it's easy to make if the universe ones
and runs in one direction it's easy to

8780
02:23:45,830 --> 02:23:45,840
and runs in one direction it's easy to
 

8781
02:23:45,840 --> 02:23:47,670
and runs in one direction it's easy to
make processes look reversible for

8782
02:23:47,670 --> 02:23:47,680
make processes look reversible for
 

8783
02:23:47,680 --> 02:23:49,670
make processes look reversible for
example if they have no memory they're

8784
02:23:49,670 --> 02:23:49,680
example if they have no memory they're
 

8785
02:23:49,680 --> 02:23:51,030
example if they have no memory they're
easy to run forward and backwards which

8786
02:23:51,030 --> 02:23:51,040
easy to run forward and backwards which
 

8787
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:52,389
easy to run forward and backwards which
is why the laws of physics that we have

8788
02:23:52,389 --> 02:23:52,399
is why the laws of physics that we have
 

8789
02:23:52,399 --> 02:23:54,790
is why the laws of physics that we have
now look the way they do because they

8790
02:23:54,790 --> 02:23:54,800
now look the way they do because they
 

8791
02:23:54,800 --> 02:23:56,550
now look the way they do because they
involve objects that have no memory but

8792
02:23:56,550 --> 02:23:56,560
involve objects that have no memory but
 

8793
02:23:56,560 --> 02:23:58,230
involve objects that have no memory but
when you get to things like us it

8794
02:23:58,230 --> 02:23:58,240
when you get to things like us it
 

8795
02:23:58,240 --> 02:23:59,830
when you get to things like us it
becomes very clear that the universe has

8796
02:23:59,830 --> 02:23:59,840
becomes very clear that the universe has
 

8797
02:23:59,840 --> 02:24:01,590
becomes very clear that the universe has
a directionality associated to it so

8798
02:24:01,590 --> 02:24:01,600
a directionality associated to it so
 

8799
02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:04,389
a directionality associated to it so
it's not reversible at all it's the um

8800
02:24:04,389 --> 02:24:04,399
it's not reversible at all it's the um
 

8801
02:24:04,399 --> 02:24:06,309
it's not reversible at all it's the um
no man ever steps in the same river i

8802
02:24:06,309 --> 02:24:06,319
no man ever steps in the same river i
 

8803
02:24:06,319 --> 02:24:07,830
no man ever steps in the same river i
just have to bring that out because yeah

8804
02:24:07,830 --> 02:24:07,840
just have to bring that out because yeah
 

8805
02:24:07,840 --> 02:24:09,830
just have to bring that out because yeah
on the river no man ever steps in the

8806
02:24:09,830 --> 02:24:09,840
on the river no man ever steps in the
 

8807
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:11,830
on the river no man ever steps in the
same river twice for it's not the same

8808
02:24:11,830 --> 02:24:11,840
same river twice for it's not the same
 

8809
02:24:11,840 --> 02:24:14,389
same river twice for it's not the same
river and he's not the same man uh so

8810
02:24:14,389 --> 02:24:14,399
river and he's not the same man uh so
 

8811
02:24:14,399 --> 02:24:16,710
river and he's not the same man uh so
that it's not reversible any of this no

8812
02:24:16,710 --> 02:24:16,720
that it's not reversible any of this no
 

8813
02:24:16,720 --> 02:24:18,630
that it's not reversible any of this no
no but reversibility is an emergent

8814
02:24:18,630 --> 02:24:18,640
no but reversibility is an emergent
 

8815
02:24:18,640 --> 02:24:20,070
no but reversibility is an emergent
property right so we think of the

8816
02:24:20,070 --> 02:24:20,080
property right so we think of the
 

8817
02:24:20,080 --> 02:24:21,270
property right so we think of the
reversibility of laws as being

8818
02:24:21,270 --> 02:24:21,280
reversibility of laws as being
 

8819
02:24:21,280 --> 02:24:23,110
reversibility of laws as being
fundamental and the irreversibility is

8820
02:24:23,110 --> 02:24:23,120
fundamental and the irreversibility is
 

8821
02:24:23,120 --> 02:24:24,710
fundamental and the irreversibility is
being emergent but i think what we would

8822
02:24:24,710 --> 02:24:24,720
being emergent but i think what we would
 

8823
02:24:24,720 --> 02:24:25,510
being emergent but i think what we would
say

8824
02:24:25,510 --> 02:24:25,520
say
 

8825
02:24:25,520 --> 02:24:27,590
say
from how we think about it and certainly

8826
02:24:27,590 --> 02:24:27,600
from how we think about it and certainly
 

8827
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:29,510
from how we think about it and certainly
sees the case for our perception of time

8828
02:24:29,510 --> 02:24:29,520
sees the case for our perception of time
 

8829
02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:31,349
sees the case for our perception of time
but also you know what's happening in

8830
02:24:31,349 --> 02:24:31,359
but also you know what's happening in
 

8831
02:24:31,359 --> 02:24:33,270
but also you know what's happening in
biological evolution

8832
02:24:33,270 --> 02:24:33,280
biological evolution
 

8833
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:35,510
biological evolution
you can make things reversible but it

8834
02:24:35,510 --> 02:24:35,520
you can make things reversible but it
 

8835
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:37,830
you can make things reversible but it
requires work to do it and it requires

8836
02:24:37,830 --> 02:24:37,840
requires work to do it and it requires
 

8837
02:24:37,840 --> 02:24:39,830
requires work to do it and it requires
certain machines to run it forward and

8838
02:24:39,830 --> 02:24:39,840
certain machines to run it forward and
 

8839
02:24:39,840 --> 02:24:41,910
certain machines to run it forward and
backward and akira marletto is working

8840
02:24:41,910 --> 02:24:41,920
backward and akira marletto is working
 

8841
02:24:41,920 --> 02:24:43,190
backward and akira marletto is working
some interesting ideas on constructor

8842
02:24:43,190 --> 02:24:43,200
some interesting ideas on constructor
 

8843
02:24:43,200 --> 02:24:44,950
some interesting ideas on constructor
theory related to that which is totally

8844
02:24:44,950 --> 02:24:44,960
theory related to that which is totally
 

8845
02:24:44,960 --> 02:24:47,270
theory related to that which is totally
different set of ideas so you can travel

8846
02:24:47,270 --> 02:24:47,280
different set of ideas so you can travel
 

8847
02:24:47,280 --> 02:24:48,550
different set of ideas so you can travel
back in time

8848
02:24:48,550 --> 02:24:48,560
back in time
 

8849
02:24:48,560 --> 02:24:51,349
back in time
sometimes yes

8850
02:24:51,349 --> 02:24:51,359
sometimes yes
 

8851
02:24:51,359 --> 02:24:53,510
sometimes yes
you can not you can't travel actually

8852
02:24:53,510 --> 02:24:53,520
you can not you can't travel actually
 

8853
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:55,510
you can not you can't travel actually
back in time but you could reconstruct

8854
02:24:55,510 --> 02:24:55,520
back in time but you could reconstruct
 

8855
02:24:55,520 --> 02:24:56,950
back in time but you could reconstruct
yeah you tried things that have existed

8856
02:24:56,950 --> 02:24:56,960
yeah you tried things that have existed
 

8857
02:24:56,960 --> 02:24:58,870
yeah you tried things that have existed
in the past you're always moving forward

8858
02:24:58,870 --> 02:24:58,880
in the past you're always moving forward
 

8859
02:24:58,880 --> 02:25:01,429
in the past you're always moving forward
in time but you can cycle through like i

8860
02:25:01,429 --> 02:25:01,439
in time but you can cycle through like i
 

8861
02:25:01,439 --> 02:25:03,270
in time but you can cycle through like i
i mean i might clarify yeah yeah go for

8862
02:25:03,270 --> 02:25:03,280
i mean i might clarify yeah yeah go for
 

8863
02:25:03,280 --> 02:25:05,349
i mean i might clarify yeah yeah go for
it quickly you travel forward in time to

8864
02:25:05,349 --> 02:25:05,359
it quickly you travel forward in time to
 

8865
02:25:05,359 --> 02:25:07,910
it quickly you travel forward in time to
travel back yes that thank you that

8866
02:25:07,910 --> 02:25:07,920
travel back yes that thank you that
 

8867
02:25:07,920 --> 02:25:09,110
travel back yes that thank you that
really clearly

8868
02:25:09,110 --> 02:25:09,120
really clearly
 

8869
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:11,030
really clearly
what what's sarah saying you don't go

8870
02:25:11,030 --> 02:25:11,040
what what's sarah saying you don't go
 

8871
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:13,670
what what's sarah saying you don't go
back in time you recreate what happened

8872
02:25:13,670 --> 02:25:13,680
back in time you recreate what happened
 

8873
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:15,429
back in time you recreate what happened
in the past in the future and inspect it

8874
02:25:15,429 --> 02:25:15,439
in the past in the future and inspect it
 

8875
02:25:15,439 --> 02:25:17,270
in the past in the future and inspect it
again so in that local pocket of time

8876
02:25:17,270 --> 02:25:17,280
again so in that local pocket of time
 

8877
02:25:17,280 --> 02:25:19,349
again so in that local pocket of time
it's as if you travel back in time so i

8878
02:25:19,349 --> 02:25:19,359
it's as if you travel back in time so i
 

8879
02:25:19,359 --> 02:25:20,230
it's as if you travel back in time so i
i don't

8880
02:25:20,230 --> 02:25:20,240
i don't
 

8881
02:25:20,240 --> 02:25:22,070
i don't
how's that not traveling back in time

8882
02:25:22,070 --> 02:25:22,080
how's that not traveling back in time
 

8883
02:25:22,080 --> 02:25:23,110
how's that not traveling back in time
because you're not going back to your

8884
02:25:23,110 --> 02:25:23,120
because you're not going back to your
 

8885
02:25:23,120 --> 02:25:25,670
because you're not going back to your
same self back in time you are you're

8886
02:25:25,670 --> 02:25:25,680
same self back in time you are you're
 

8887
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:27,750
same self back in time you are you're
creating that in the future what else is

8888
02:25:27,750 --> 02:25:27,760
creating that in the future what else is
 

8889
02:25:27,760 --> 02:25:29,510
creating that in the future what else is
the same as it was in the past

8890
02:25:29,510 --> 02:25:29,520
the same as it was in the past
 

8891
02:25:29,520 --> 02:25:30,389
the same as it was in the past
no

8892
02:25:30,389 --> 02:25:30,399
no
 

8893
02:25:30,399 --> 02:25:31,429
no
no no no

8894
02:25:31,429 --> 02:25:31,439
no no no
 

8895
02:25:31,439 --> 02:25:33,190
no no no
it's not in registry i mean it goes back

8896
02:25:33,190 --> 02:25:33,200
it's not in registry i mean it goes back
 

8897
02:25:33,200 --> 02:25:35,270
it's not in registry i mean it goes back
to the big question i'm saying i mean

8898
02:25:35,270 --> 02:25:35,280
to the big question i'm saying i mean
 

8899
02:25:35,280 --> 02:25:36,950
to the big question i'm saying i mean
this is something

8900
02:25:36,950 --> 02:25:36,960
this is something
 

8901
02:25:36,960 --> 02:25:38,630
this is something
i was trying to look up today when i

8902
02:25:38,630 --> 02:25:38,640
i was trying to look up today when i
 

8903
02:25:38,640 --> 02:25:40,469
i was trying to look up today when i
first we first had this discussion and i

8904
02:25:40,469 --> 02:25:40,479
first we first had this discussion and i
 

8905
02:25:40,479 --> 02:25:42,230
first we first had this discussion and i
was talking to sarah on skype and i said

8906
02:25:42,230 --> 02:25:42,240
was talking to sarah on skype and i said
 

8907
02:25:42,240 --> 02:25:43,270
was talking to sarah on skype and i said
by the way

8908
02:25:43,270 --> 02:25:43,280
by the way
 

8909
02:25:43,280 --> 02:25:44,870
by the way
time because time is the fundamental

8910
02:25:44,870 --> 02:25:44,880
time because time is the fundamental
 

8911
02:25:44,880 --> 02:25:46,469
time because time is the fundamental
thing in the universe she's almost hung

8912
02:25:46,469 --> 02:25:46,479
thing in the universe she's almost hung
 

8913
02:25:46,479 --> 02:25:48,630
thing in the universe she's almost hung
up on me right but but you can even i

8914
02:25:48,630 --> 02:25:48,640
up on me right but but you can even i
 

8915
02:25:48,640 --> 02:25:50,230
up on me right but but you can even i
mean if you want to make an analogy to

8916
02:25:50,230 --> 02:25:50,240
mean if you want to make an analogy to
 

8917
02:25:50,240 --> 02:25:51,830
mean if you want to make an analogy to
computation and i think charles bennett

8918
02:25:51,830 --> 02:25:51,840
computation and i think charles bennett
 

8919
02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:53,349
computation and i think charles bennett
actually has a paper on this like about

8920
02:25:53,349 --> 02:25:53,359
actually has a paper on this like about
 

8921
02:25:53,359 --> 02:25:55,830
actually has a paper on this like about
reversible computation and reversible

8922
02:25:55,830 --> 02:25:55,840
reversible computation and reversible
 

8923
02:25:55,840 --> 02:25:57,510
reversible computation and reversible
turing machines in order to make it

8924
02:25:57,510 --> 02:25:57,520
turing machines in order to make it
 

8925
02:25:57,520 --> 02:25:59,349
turing machines in order to make it
reversible you have to store memory to

8926
02:25:59,349 --> 02:25:59,359
reversible you have to store memory to
 

8927
02:25:59,359 --> 02:26:01,190
reversible you have to store memory to
run the process backwards

8928
02:26:01,190 --> 02:26:01,200
run the process backwards
 

8929
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:02,230
run the process backwards
so

8930
02:26:02,230 --> 02:26:02,240
so
 

8931
02:26:02,240 --> 02:26:04,469
so
time is always running forward in that

8932
02:26:04,469 --> 02:26:04,479
time is always running forward in that
 

8933
02:26:04,479 --> 02:26:05,510
time is always running forward in that
because you have to write the memory

8934
02:26:05,510 --> 02:26:05,520
because you have to write the memory
 

8935
02:26:05,520 --> 02:26:07,349
because you have to write the memory
erase the memory you can erase the

8936
02:26:07,349 --> 02:26:07,359
erase the memory you can erase the
 

8937
02:26:07,359 --> 02:26:09,670
erase the memory you can erase the
memory but the point

8938
02:26:09,670 --> 02:26:09,680
memory but the point
 

8939
02:26:09,680 --> 02:26:11,590
memory but the point
when you go back to zero right but the

8940
02:26:11,590 --> 02:26:11,600
when you go back to zero right but the
 

8941
02:26:11,600 --> 02:26:14,230
when you go back to zero right but the
whole point is that in order to have a

8942
02:26:14,230 --> 02:26:14,240
whole point is that in order to have a
 

8943
02:26:14,240 --> 02:26:16,710
whole point is that in order to have a
process that even runs in both

8944
02:26:16,710 --> 02:26:16,720
process that even runs in both
 

8945
02:26:16,720 --> 02:26:18,309
process that even runs in both
directions you have to start talking

8946
02:26:18,309 --> 02:26:18,319
directions you have to start talking
 

8947
02:26:18,319 --> 02:26:20,389
directions you have to start talking
about memory to store the information to

8948
02:26:20,389 --> 02:26:20,399
about memory to store the information to
 

8949
02:26:20,399 --> 02:26:23,030
about memory to store the information to
run it backwards i got it so you can't

8950
02:26:23,030 --> 02:26:23,040
run it backwards i got it so you can't
 

8951
02:26:23,040 --> 02:26:24,550
run it backwards i got it so you can't
really then

8952
02:26:24,550 --> 02:26:24,560
really then
 

8953
02:26:24,560 --> 02:26:26,389
really then
you can't have it exactly how it was in

8954
02:26:26,389 --> 02:26:26,399
you can't have it exactly how it was in
 

8955
02:26:26,399 --> 02:26:28,550
you can't have it exactly how it was in
the past yeah you exactly so you either

8956
02:26:28,550 --> 02:26:28,560
the past yeah you exactly so you either
 

8957
02:26:28,560 --> 02:26:30,790
the past yeah you exactly so you either
have extra stuff extra baggage always

8958
02:26:30,790 --> 02:26:30,800
have extra stuff extra baggage always
 

8959
02:26:30,800 --> 02:26:32,710
have extra stuff extra baggage always
okay a really important thing i want to

8960
02:26:32,710 --> 02:26:32,720
okay a really important thing i want to
 

8961
02:26:32,720 --> 02:26:34,230
okay a really important thing i want to
say on this i think if i try and get it

8962
02:26:34,230 --> 02:26:34,240
say on this i think if i try and get it
 

8963
02:26:34,240 --> 02:26:36,469
say on this i think if i try and get it
right to say that if you can think that

8964
02:26:36,469 --> 02:26:36,479
right to say that if you can think that
 

8965
02:26:36,479 --> 02:26:38,950
right to say that if you can think that
the universe is expanding in terms of

8966
02:26:38,950 --> 02:26:38,960
the universe is expanding in terms of
 

8967
02:26:38,960 --> 02:26:40,230
the universe is expanding in terms of
the number of

8968
02:26:40,230 --> 02:26:40,240
the number of
 

8969
02:26:40,240 --> 02:26:43,750
the number of
boxes that it has to store states

8970
02:26:43,750 --> 02:26:43,760
boxes that it has to store states
 

8971
02:26:43,760 --> 02:26:44,790
boxes that it has to store states
right

8972
02:26:44,790 --> 02:26:44,800
right
 

8973
02:26:44,800 --> 02:26:46,630
right
um and this is where the directionality

8974
02:26:46,630 --> 02:26:46,640
um and this is where the directionality
 

8975
02:26:46,640 --> 02:26:48,070
um and this is where the directionality
of the universe comes from everything

8976
02:26:48,070 --> 02:26:48,080
of the universe comes from everything
 

8977
02:26:48,080 --> 02:26:49,990
of the universe comes from everything
comes from you could erase what's in

8978
02:26:49,990 --> 02:26:50,000
comes from you could erase what's in
 

8979
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,150
comes from you could erase what's in
those boxes but the fact you've now got

8980
02:26:52,150 --> 02:26:52,160
those boxes but the fact you've now got
 

8981
02:26:52,160 --> 02:26:54,790
those boxes but the fact you've now got
so many boxes at time now in the in this

8982
02:26:54,790 --> 02:26:54,800
so many boxes at time now in the in this
 

8983
02:26:54,800 --> 02:26:56,550
so many boxes at time now in the in this
present there's more of those boxes than

8984
02:26:56,550 --> 02:26:56,560
present there's more of those boxes than
 

8985
02:26:56,560 --> 02:26:59,030
present there's more of those boxes than
there were in the past see but the boxes

8986
02:26:59,030 --> 02:26:59,040
there were in the past see but the boxes
 

8987
02:26:59,040 --> 02:27:00,870
there were in the past see but the boxes
aren't physical boxes

8988
02:27:00,870 --> 02:27:00,880
aren't physical boxes
 

8989
02:27:00,880 --> 02:27:03,349
aren't physical boxes
they

8990
02:27:03,349 --> 02:27:03,359

 

8991
02:27:03,359 --> 02:27:04,710

why is the number of boxes always

8992
02:27:04,710 --> 02:27:04,720
why is the number of boxes always
 

8993
02:27:04,720 --> 02:27:07,750
why is the number of boxes always
expanding it's very hard to imagine this

8994
02:27:07,750 --> 02:27:07,760
expanding it's very hard to imagine this
 

8995
02:27:07,760 --> 02:27:09,510
expanding it's very hard to imagine this
because we live in space

8996
02:27:09,510 --> 02:27:09,520
because we live in space
 

8997
02:27:09,520 --> 02:27:12,550
because we live in space
so what i'm saying which is i think

8998
02:27:12,550 --> 02:27:12,560
so what i'm saying which is i think
 

8999
02:27:12,560 --> 02:27:14,309
so what i'm saying which is i think
probably correct

9000
02:27:14,309 --> 02:27:14,319
probably correct
 

9001
02:27:14,319 --> 02:27:16,469
probably correct
is that we just let's just imagine for a

9002
02:27:16,469 --> 02:27:16,479
is that we just let's just imagine for a
 

9003
02:27:16,479 --> 02:27:17,750
is that we just let's just imagine for a
second

9004
02:27:17,750 --> 02:27:17,760
second
 

9005
02:27:17,760 --> 02:27:20,870
second
there is a non-local situation but there

9006
02:27:20,870 --> 02:27:20,880
there is a non-local situation but there
 

9007
02:27:20,880 --> 02:27:23,349
there is a non-local situation but there
are these things called states

9008
02:27:23,349 --> 02:27:23,359
are these things called states
 

9009
02:27:23,359 --> 02:27:25,510
are these things called states
and that the universe

9010
02:27:25,510 --> 02:27:25,520
and that the universe
 

9011
02:27:25,520 --> 02:27:27,750
and that the universe
um irrespective of whether you measure

9012
02:27:27,750 --> 02:27:27,760
um irrespective of whether you measure
 

9013
02:27:27,760 --> 02:27:28,790
um irrespective of whether you measure
anything

9014
02:27:28,790 --> 02:27:28,800
anything
 

9015
02:27:28,800 --> 02:27:31,030
anything
there is a universal let's call it a

9016
02:27:31,030 --> 02:27:31,040
there is a universal let's call it a
 

9017
02:27:31,040 --> 02:27:33,270
there is a universal let's call it a
clock or a state creator

9018
02:27:33,270 --> 02:27:33,280
clock or a state creator
 

9019
02:27:33,280 --> 02:27:35,510
clock or a state creator
maybe we can call it this way maybe you

9020
02:27:35,510 --> 02:27:35,520
maybe we can call it this way maybe you
 

9021
02:27:35,520 --> 02:27:37,030
maybe we can call it this way maybe you
can call it god but let's call it a

9022
02:27:37,030 --> 02:27:37,040
can call it god but let's call it a
 

9023
02:27:37,040 --> 02:27:38,870
can call it god but let's call it a
state creator where the universe is

9024
02:27:38,870 --> 02:27:38,880
state creator where the universe is
 

9025
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:41,510
state creator where the universe is
expanding in the number of states it has

9026
02:27:41,510 --> 02:27:41,520
expanding in the number of states it has
 

9027
02:27:41,520 --> 02:27:43,190
expanding in the number of states it has
why are you saying it's expanding though

9028
02:27:43,190 --> 02:27:43,200
why are you saying it's expanding though
 

9029
02:27:43,200 --> 02:27:44,710
why are you saying it's expanding though
is that obvious that it's expanding it's

9030
02:27:44,710 --> 02:27:44,720
is that obvious that it's expanding it's
 

9031
02:27:44,720 --> 02:27:46,550
is that obvious that it's expanding it's
obvious because that's where the because

9032
02:27:46,550 --> 02:27:46,560
obvious because that's where the because
 

9033
02:27:46,560 --> 02:27:47,750
obvious because that's where the because
um we

9034
02:27:47,750 --> 02:27:47,760
um we
 

9035
02:27:47,760 --> 02:27:48,870
um we
we

9036
02:27:48,870 --> 02:27:48,880
we
 

9037
02:27:48,880 --> 02:27:50,790
we
that's a source of novelty it's a source

9038
02:27:50,790 --> 02:27:50,800
that's a source of novelty it's a source
 

9039
02:27:50,800 --> 02:27:53,030
that's a source of novelty it's a source
of novelty and it also explains why the

9040
02:27:53,030 --> 02:27:53,040
of novelty and it also explains why the
 

9041
02:27:53,040 --> 02:27:55,270
of novelty and it also explains why the
universe is not predictable

9042
02:27:55,270 --> 02:27:55,280
universe is not predictable
 

9043
02:27:55,280 --> 02:27:56,950
universe is not predictable
um and you know it's not predictable

9044
02:27:56,950 --> 02:27:56,960
um and you know it's not predictable
 

9045
02:27:56,960 --> 02:27:57,590
um and you know it's not predictable
well

9046
02:27:57,590 --> 02:27:57,600
well
 

9047
02:27:57,600 --> 02:27:59,270
well
i just like interrupting you i'm sorry

9048
02:27:59,270 --> 02:27:59,280
i just like interrupting you i'm sorry
 

9049
02:27:59,280 --> 02:28:01,510
i just like interrupting you i'm sorry
it's fun as you're struggling i'm

9050
02:28:01,510 --> 02:28:01,520
it's fun as you're struggling i'm
 

9051
02:28:01,520 --> 02:28:03,270
it's fun as you're struggling i'm
struggling because it's but i'm trying

9052
02:28:03,270 --> 02:28:03,280
struggling because it's but i'm trying
 

9053
02:28:03,280 --> 02:28:04,950
struggling because it's but i'm trying
to be as concrete as possible and not

9054
02:28:04,950 --> 02:28:04,960
to be as concrete as possible and not
 

9055
02:28:04,960 --> 02:28:07,750
to be as concrete as possible and not
sound like i'm insane yeah um and i'm

9056
02:28:07,750 --> 02:28:07,760
sound like i'm insane yeah um and i'm
 

9057
02:28:07,760 --> 02:28:10,830
sound like i'm insane yeah um and i'm
not insane it's it's obvious because you

9058
02:28:10,830 --> 02:28:10,840
not insane it's it's obvious because you
 

9059
02:28:10,840 --> 02:28:13,270
not insane it's it's obvious because you
did um

9060
02:28:13,270 --> 02:28:13,280
did um
 

9061
02:28:13,280 --> 02:28:16,389
did um
i'm a chemist so as a chemist i grew

9062
02:28:16,389 --> 02:28:16,399
i'm a chemist so as a chemist i grew
 

9063
02:28:16,399 --> 02:28:17,910
i'm a chemist so as a chemist i grew
into the world understanding

irreversibility all irreversibility is

9066
02:28:20,230 --> 02:28:20,240
irreversibility all irreversibility is
 

9067
02:28:20,240 --> 02:28:21,910
irreversibility all irreversibility is
all i knew

9068
02:28:21,910 --> 02:28:21,920
all i knew
 

9069
02:28:21,920 --> 02:28:23,990
all i knew
and when people start

9070
02:28:23,990 --> 02:28:24,000
and when people start
 

9071
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:25,510
and when people start
telling me the universe is actually

9072
02:28:25,510 --> 02:28:25,520
telling me the universe is actually
 

9073
02:28:25,520 --> 02:28:27,750
telling me the universe is actually
reversible it's a magic trick we can use

9074
02:28:27,750 --> 02:28:27,760
reversible it's a magic trick we can use
 

9075
02:28:27,760 --> 02:28:30,630
reversible it's a magic trick we can use
time to do it so what i mean is the the

9076
02:28:30,630 --> 02:28:30,640
time to do it so what i mean is the the
 

9077
02:28:30,640 --> 02:28:32,550
time to do it so what i mean is the the
the second law

9078
02:28:32,550 --> 02:28:32,560
the second law
 

9079
02:28:32,560 --> 02:28:34,630
the second law
is um

9080
02:28:34,630 --> 02:28:34,640
is um
 

9081
02:28:34,640 --> 02:28:36,870
is um
really the

9082
02:28:36,870 --> 02:28:36,880
really the
 

9083
02:28:36,880 --> 02:28:38,469
really the
magical

9084
02:28:38,469 --> 02:28:38,479
magical
 

9085
02:28:38,479 --> 02:28:39,990
magical
but why does it need to be magical the

9086
02:28:39,990 --> 02:28:40,000
but why does it need to be magical the
 

9087
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:41,750
but why does it need to be magical the
universe is just asymmetric all i'm

9088
02:28:41,750 --> 02:28:41,760
universe is just asymmetric all i'm
 

9089
02:28:41,760 --> 02:28:43,670
universe is just asymmetric all i'm
saying is the universe is asymmetric in

9090
02:28:43,670 --> 02:28:43,680
saying is the universe is asymmetric in
 

9091
02:28:43,680 --> 02:28:45,190
saying is the universe is asymmetric in
the state production

9092
02:28:45,190 --> 02:28:45,200
the state production
 

9093
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:48,150
the state production
and we can erase those states but we

9094
02:28:48,150 --> 02:28:48,160
and we can erase those states but we
 

9095
02:28:48,160 --> 02:28:50,389
and we can erase those states but we
just have more computational power so

9096
02:28:50,389 --> 02:28:50,399
just have more computational power so
 

9097
02:28:50,399 --> 02:28:53,429
just have more computational power so
what i'm saying is that the universe is

9098
02:28:53,429 --> 02:28:53,439
what i'm saying is that the universe is
 

9099
02:28:53,439 --> 02:28:55,910
what i'm saying is that the universe is
deterministic horizon this is one of the

9100
02:28:55,910 --> 02:28:55,920
deterministic horizon this is one of the
 

9101
02:28:55,920 --> 02:28:57,510
deterministic horizon this is one of the
reasons we can't live in a simulation by

9102
02:28:57,510 --> 02:28:57,520
reasons we can't live in a simulation by
 

9103
02:28:57,520 --> 02:28:59,990
reasons we can't live in a simulation by
the way

9104
02:28:59,990 --> 02:29:00,000

 

9105
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:01,309

we can't live in a simulation the

9106
02:29:01,309 --> 02:29:01,319
we can't live in a simulation the
 

9107
02:29:01,319 --> 02:29:03,510
we can't live in a simulation the
irreversibility yeah yeah so basically

9108
02:29:03,510 --> 02:29:03,520
irreversibility yeah yeah so basically
 

9109
02:29:03,520 --> 02:29:04,790
irreversibility yeah yeah so basically
every time you try and simulate the

9110
02:29:04,790 --> 02:29:04,800
every time you try and simulate the
 

9111
02:29:04,800 --> 02:29:05,910
every time you try and simulate the
universe

9112
02:29:05,910 --> 02:29:05,920
universe
 

9113
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:07,349
universe
in this you know live in a simulation

9114
02:29:07,349 --> 02:29:07,359
in this you know live in a simulation
 

9115
02:29:07,359 --> 02:29:09,190
in this you know live in a simulation
the universe has expanded in states like

9116
02:29:09,190 --> 02:29:09,200
the universe has expanded in states like
 

9117
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:10,469
the universe has expanded in states like
oh damn it i need to make my computer

9118
02:29:10,469 --> 02:29:10,479
oh damn it i need to make my computer
 

9119
02:29:10,479 --> 02:29:12,389
oh damn it i need to make my computer
bigger again and every time you try and

9120
02:29:12,389 --> 02:29:12,399
bigger again and every time you try and
 

9121
02:29:12,399 --> 02:29:14,389
bigger again and every time you try and
contain the universe in the computation

9122
02:29:14,389 --> 02:29:14,399
contain the universe in the computation
 

9123
02:29:14,399 --> 02:29:15,670
contain the universe in the computation
because it's got bigger a number of

9124
02:29:15,670 --> 02:29:15,680
because it's got bigger a number of
 

9125
02:29:15,680 --> 02:29:18,550
because it's got bigger a number of
states and so i'm saying

9126
02:29:18,550 --> 02:29:18,560
states and so i'm saying
 

9127
02:29:18,560 --> 02:29:21,270
states and so i'm saying
the fact the universe has novelty in it

9128
02:29:21,270 --> 02:29:21,280
the fact the universe has novelty in it
 

9129
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:23,750
the fact the universe has novelty in it
is going to turn out experimentally to

9130
02:29:23,750 --> 02:29:23,760
is going to turn out experimentally to
 

9131
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:25,110
is going to turn out experimentally to
be proof

9132
02:29:25,110 --> 02:29:25,120
be proof
 

9133
02:29:25,120 --> 02:29:27,190
be proof
that time

9134
02:29:27,190 --> 02:29:27,200
that time
 

9135
02:29:27,200 --> 02:29:30,070
that time
as i've labeled it is fundamental

9136
02:29:30,070 --> 02:29:30,080
as i've labeled it is fundamental
 

9137
02:29:30,080 --> 02:29:32,870
as i've labeled it is fundamental
and exists as a physical thing that

9138
02:29:32,870 --> 02:29:32,880
and exists as a physical thing that
 

9139
02:29:32,880 --> 02:29:34,870
and exists as a physical thing that
creates space

9140
02:29:34,870 --> 02:29:34,880
creates space
 

9141
02:29:34,880 --> 02:29:36,790
creates space
okay so if you can prove

9142
02:29:36,790 --> 02:29:36,800
okay so if you can prove
 

9143
02:29:36,800 --> 02:29:39,510
okay so if you can prove
that novelty is always being created

9144
02:29:39,510 --> 02:29:39,520
that novelty is always being created
 

9145
02:29:39,520 --> 02:29:41,110
that novelty is always being created
you're saying that it's possible to also

9146
02:29:41,110 --> 02:29:41,120
you're saying that it's possible to also
 

9147
02:29:41,120 --> 02:29:43,990
you're saying that it's possible to also
then prove that it's always expanding in

9148
02:29:43,990 --> 02:29:44,000
then prove that it's always expanding in
 

9149
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,230
then prove that it's always expanding in
the state space those are things that to

9150
02:29:46,230 --> 02:29:46,240
the state space those are things that to
 

9151
02:29:46,240 --> 02:29:47,110
the state space those are things that to
be

9152
02:29:47,110 --> 02:29:47,120
be
 

9153
02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:48,710
be
have to be proven that's what working

9154
02:29:48,710 --> 02:29:48,720
have to be proven that's what working
 

9155
02:29:48,720 --> 02:29:50,550
have to be proven that's what working
experiments for yeah and you're trying

9156
02:29:50,550 --> 02:29:50,560
experiments for yeah and you're trying
 

9157
02:29:50,560 --> 02:29:52,710
experiments for yeah and you're trying
to like by looking at the sliver of

9158
02:29:52,710 --> 02:29:52,720
to like by looking at the sliver of
 

9159
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:54,230
to like by looking at the sliver of
reality

9160
02:29:54,230 --> 02:29:54,240
reality
 

9161
02:29:54,240 --> 02:29:55,990
reality
show that there's always novelty being

9162
02:29:55,990 --> 02:29:56,000
show that there's always novelty being
 

9163
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:57,110
show that there's always novelty being
generated yeah

9164
02:29:57,110 --> 02:29:57,120
generated yeah
 

9165
02:29:57,120 --> 02:29:58,950
generated yeah
because if we go and live in a universe

9166
02:29:58,950 --> 02:29:58,960
because if we go and live in a universe
 

9167
02:29:58,960 --> 02:30:00,790
because if we go and live in a universe
that the conventional physicists would

9168
02:30:00,790 --> 02:30:00,800
that the conventional physicists would
 

9169
02:30:00,800 --> 02:30:03,190
that the conventional physicists would
live in it's a big lookup table of stuff

9170
02:30:03,190 --> 02:30:03,200
live in it's a big lookup table of stuff
 

9171
02:30:03,200 --> 02:30:04,950
live in it's a big lookup table of stuff
and everything exists

9172
02:30:04,950 --> 02:30:04,960
and everything exists
 

9173
02:30:04,960 --> 02:30:06,950
and everything exists
i want to prove

9174
02:30:06,950 --> 02:30:06,960
i want to prove
 

9175
02:30:06,960 --> 02:30:08,790
i want to prove
that that book is

9176
02:30:08,790 --> 02:30:08,800
that that book is
 

9177
02:30:08,800 --> 02:30:10,070
that that book is
that book doesn't exist it's

9178
02:30:10,070 --> 02:30:10,080
that book doesn't exist it's
 

9179
02:30:10,080 --> 02:30:12,309
that book doesn't exist it's
continuously being added pages on so

9180
02:30:12,309 --> 02:30:12,319
continuously being added pages on so
 

9181
02:30:12,319 --> 02:30:13,590
continuously being added pages on so
what i'm saying if the universe is a

9182
02:30:13,590 --> 02:30:13,600
what i'm saying if the universe is a
 

9183
02:30:13,600 --> 02:30:14,389
what i'm saying if the universe is a
book

9184
02:30:14,389 --> 02:30:14,399
book
 

9185
02:30:14,399 --> 02:30:16,150
book
we started the universe at the beginning

9186
02:30:16,150 --> 02:30:16,160
we started the universe at the beginning
 

9187
02:30:16,160 --> 02:30:18,150
we started the universe at the beginning
only had no pages and they have all had

9188
02:30:18,150 --> 02:30:18,160
only had no pages and they have all had
 

9189
02:30:18,160 --> 02:30:19,750
only had no pages and they have all had
one page another page another page

9190
02:30:19,750 --> 02:30:19,760
one page another page another page
 

9191
02:30:19,760 --> 02:30:21,190
one page another page another page
whereas a physicist will now say all the

9192
02:30:21,190 --> 02:30:21,200
whereas a physicist will now say all the
 

9193
02:30:21,200 --> 02:30:23,670
whereas a physicist will now say all the
pages exist and we could in principle

9194
02:30:23,670 --> 02:30:23,680
pages exist and we could in principle
 

9195
02:30:23,680 --> 02:30:25,590
pages exist and we could in principle
access them i'm saying that is

9196
02:30:25,590 --> 02:30:25,600
access them i'm saying that is
 

9197
02:30:25,600 --> 02:30:27,590
access them i'm saying that is
fundamentally incorrect do you know

9198
02:30:27,590 --> 02:30:27,600
fundamentally incorrect do you know
 

9199
02:30:27,600 --> 02:30:29,510
fundamentally incorrect do you know
what's written in this book the free

9200
02:30:29,510 --> 02:30:29,520
what's written in this book the free
 

9201
02:30:29,520 --> 02:30:30,710
what's written in this book the free
will question

9202
02:30:30,710 --> 02:30:30,720
will question
 

9203
02:30:30,720 --> 02:30:34,230
will question
um is there room for free will

9204
02:30:34,230 --> 02:30:34,240
um is there room for free will
 

9205
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:35,510
um is there room for free will
in this

9206
02:30:35,510 --> 02:30:35,520
in this
 

9207
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:36,870
in this
uh

9208
02:30:36,870 --> 02:30:36,880
uh
 

9209
02:30:36,880 --> 02:30:38,950
uh
in us in this view of the universe is

9210
02:30:38,950 --> 02:30:38,960
in us in this view of the universe is
 

9211
02:30:38,960 --> 02:30:41,670
in us in this view of the universe is
generating novelty and getting greater

9212
02:30:41,670 --> 02:30:41,680
generating novelty and getting greater
 

9213
02:30:41,680 --> 02:30:43,270
generating novelty and getting greater
and greater assembly

9214
02:30:43,270 --> 02:30:43,280
and greater assembly
 

9215
02:30:43,280 --> 02:30:44,790
and greater assembly
uh structures

9216
02:30:44,790 --> 02:30:44,800
uh structures
 

9217
02:30:44,800 --> 02:30:45,590
uh structures
built

9218
02:30:45,590 --> 02:30:45,600

sarah
yes

9222
02:30:47,910 --> 02:30:47,920
yes
 

9223
02:30:47,920 --> 02:30:48,870
yes
okay

9224
02:30:48,870 --> 02:30:48,880
okay
 

9225
02:30:48,880 --> 02:30:49,750
okay
done

9226
02:30:49,750 --> 02:30:49,760
done
 

9227
02:30:49,760 --> 02:30:50,950
done
next question

9228
02:30:50,950 --> 02:30:50,960
next question
 

9229
02:30:50,960 --> 02:30:52,710
next question
why what's the source of free will in

9230
02:30:52,710 --> 02:30:52,720
why what's the source of free will in
 

9231
02:30:52,720 --> 02:30:54,469
why what's the source of free will in
this well so i i think it depends on

9232
02:30:54,469 --> 02:30:54,479
this well so i i think it depends on
 

9233
02:30:54,479 --> 02:30:57,110
this well so i i think it depends on
what you mean by free will um

9234
02:30:57,110 --> 02:30:57,120
what you mean by free will um
 

9235
02:30:57,120 --> 02:30:58,150
what you mean by free will um
but

9236
02:30:58,150 --> 02:30:58,160
but
 

9237
02:30:58,160 --> 02:31:00,469
but
yeah well please

9238
02:31:00,469 --> 02:31:00,479
yeah well please
 

9239
02:31:00,479 --> 02:31:02,389
yeah well please
i think i think what i'm interested in

9240
02:31:02,389 --> 02:31:02,399
i think i think what i'm interested in
 

9241
02:31:02,399 --> 02:31:03,990
i think i think what i'm interested in
as far as the

9242
02:31:03,990 --> 02:31:04,000
as far as the
 

9243
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,150
as far as the
phenomena of free will is

9244
02:31:06,150 --> 02:31:06,160
phenomena of free will is
 

9245
02:31:06,160 --> 02:31:07,830
phenomena of free will is
uh do we have

9246
02:31:07,830 --> 02:31:07,840
uh do we have
 

9247
02:31:07,840 --> 02:31:10,389
uh do we have
individual autonomy and agency

9248
02:31:10,389 --> 02:31:10,399
individual autonomy and agency
 

9249
02:31:10,399 --> 02:31:12,550
individual autonomy and agency
and you know when i do things is it

9250
02:31:12,550 --> 02:31:12,560
and you know when i do things is it
 

9251
02:31:12,560 --> 02:31:15,670
and you know when i do things is it
really me or is it my atoms that did it

9252
02:31:15,670 --> 02:31:15,680
really me or is it my atoms that did it
 

9253
02:31:15,680 --> 02:31:17,590
really me or is it my atoms that did it
um and

9254
02:31:17,590 --> 02:31:17,600
um and
 

9255
02:31:17,600 --> 02:31:19,030
um and
that's the part that's interesting to me

9256
02:31:19,030 --> 02:31:19,040
that's the part that's interesting to me
 

9257
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:20,630
that's the part that's interesting to me
i guess there's also the determinism

9258
02:31:20,630 --> 02:31:20,640
i guess there's also the determinism
 

9259
02:31:20,640 --> 02:31:22,469
i guess there's also the determinism
versus randomness part

9260
02:31:22,469 --> 02:31:22,479
versus randomness part
 

9261
02:31:22,479 --> 02:31:24,630
versus randomness part
um but the way i think about it is like

9262
02:31:24,630 --> 02:31:24,640
um but the way i think about it is like
 

9263
02:31:24,640 --> 02:31:26,469
um but the way i think about it is like
each of us are

9264
02:31:26,469 --> 02:31:26,479
each of us are
 

9265
02:31:26,479 --> 02:31:29,190
each of us are
like a thread or like an a you know

9266
02:31:29,190 --> 02:31:29,200
like a thread or like an a you know
 

9267
02:31:29,200 --> 02:31:30,870
like a thread or like an a you know
assembly space through

9268
02:31:30,870 --> 02:31:30,880
assembly space through
 

9269
02:31:30,880 --> 02:31:33,030
assembly space through
you know this this giant possibility

9270
02:31:33,030 --> 02:31:33,040
you know this this giant possibility
 

9271
02:31:33,040 --> 02:31:35,990
you know this this giant possibility
space and it's like we're moving

9272
02:31:35,990 --> 02:31:36,000
space and it's like we're moving
 

9273
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:37,670
space and it's like we're moving
on our own trajectory through that space

9274
02:31:37,670 --> 02:31:37,680
on our own trajectory through that space
 

9275
02:31:37,680 --> 02:31:39,670
on our own trajectory through that space
and that is defined by our history so

9276
02:31:39,670 --> 02:31:39,680
and that is defined by our history so
 

9277
02:31:39,680 --> 02:31:41,510
and that is defined by our history so
we're sort of causally contingent on our

9278
02:31:41,510 --> 02:31:41,520
we're sort of causally contingent on our
 

9279
02:31:41,520 --> 02:31:42,469
we're sort of causally contingent on our
past

9280
02:31:42,469 --> 02:31:42,479
past
 

9281
02:31:42,479 --> 02:31:44,950
past
but also because of the

9282
02:31:44,950 --> 02:31:44,960
but also because of the
 

9283
02:31:44,960 --> 02:31:45,830
but also because of the
sort of

9284
02:31:45,830 --> 02:31:45,840
sort of
 

9285
02:31:45,840 --> 02:31:47,349
sort of
intersection of

9286
02:31:47,349 --> 02:31:47,359
intersection of
 

9287
02:31:47,359 --> 02:31:49,910
intersection of
novelty generation it's not completely

9288
02:31:49,910 --> 02:31:49,920
novelty generation it's not completely
 

9289
02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:51,990
novelty generation it's not completely
predetermined by the past

9290
02:31:51,990 --> 02:31:52,000
predetermined by the past
 

9291
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:53,110
predetermined by the past
and so

9292
02:31:53,110 --> 02:31:53,120
and so
 

9293
02:31:53,120 --> 02:31:54,830
and so
so then you have the causal

9294
02:31:54,830 --> 02:31:54,840
so then you have the causal
 

9295
02:31:54,840 --> 02:31:58,230
so then you have the causal
control of the determinism part that you

9296
02:31:58,230 --> 02:31:58,240
control of the determinism part that you
 

9297
02:31:58,240 --> 02:31:59,750
control of the determinism part that you
are your causal history and there's some

9298
02:31:59,750 --> 02:31:59,760
are your causal history and there's some
 

9299
02:31:59,760 --> 02:32:01,910
are your causal history and there's some
determinism from that past but there's

9300
02:32:01,910 --> 02:32:01,920
determinism from that past but there's
 

9301
02:32:01,920 --> 02:32:03,190
determinism from that past but there's
also

9302
02:32:03,190 --> 02:32:03,200
also
 

9303
02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:04,950
also
room for creativity and i think it's

9304
02:32:04,950 --> 02:32:04,960
room for creativity and i think it's
 

9305
02:32:04,960 --> 02:32:05,910
room for creativity and i think it's
actually

9306
02:32:05,910 --> 02:32:05,920
actually
 

9307
02:32:05,920 --> 02:32:07,830
actually
necessary that something like free will

9308
02:32:07,830 --> 02:32:07,840
necessary that something like free will
 

9309
02:32:07,840 --> 02:32:09,830
necessary that something like free will
exists if the universe is going to be as

9310
02:32:09,830 --> 02:32:09,840
exists if the universe is going to be as
 

9311
02:32:09,840 --> 02:32:12,309
exists if the universe is going to be as
creative as possible because

9312
02:32:12,309 --> 02:32:12,319
creative as possible because
 

9313
02:32:12,319 --> 02:32:14,790
creative as possible because
if i were

9314
02:32:14,790 --> 02:32:14,800
if i were
 

9315
02:32:14,800 --> 02:32:16,870
if i were
all intelligent being inventing a

9316
02:32:16,870 --> 02:32:16,880
all intelligent being inventing a
 

9317
02:32:16,880 --> 02:32:17,990
all intelligent being inventing a

9318
02:32:17,990 --> 02:32:18,000
universe
 

9319
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:19,990
universe
and i wanted it to have

9320
02:32:19,990 --> 02:32:20,000
and i wanted it to have
 

9321
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:21,990
and i wanted it to have
maximal number of interesting things

9322
02:32:21,990 --> 02:32:22,000
maximal number of interesting things
 

9323
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:23,590
maximal number of interesting things
happen again we should come up with the

9324
02:32:23,590 --> 02:32:23,600
happen again we should come up with the
 

9325
02:32:23,600 --> 02:32:26,230
happen again we should come up with the
metric of interesting um but

9326
02:32:26,230 --> 02:32:26,240
metric of interesting um but
 

9327
02:32:26,240 --> 02:32:29,670
metric of interesting um but
generating yes i know generating um you

9328
02:32:29,670 --> 02:32:29,680
generating yes i know generating um you
 

9329
02:32:29,680 --> 02:32:32,150
generating yes i know generating um you
know maximal possibilities then i would

9330
02:32:32,150 --> 02:32:32,160
know maximal possibilities then i would
 

9331
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:33,670
know maximal possibilities then i would
want the agents to have free will

9332
02:32:33,670 --> 02:32:33,680
want the agents to have free will
 

9333
02:32:33,680 --> 02:32:37,030
want the agents to have free will
because it means that they're

9334
02:32:37,030 --> 02:32:37,040
because it means that they're
 

9335
02:32:37,040 --> 02:32:39,750
because it means that they're
more individual like they are like each

9336
02:32:39,750 --> 02:32:39,760
more individual like they are like each
 

9337
02:32:39,760 --> 02:32:41,429
more individual like they are like each
entity actually is a different causal

9338
02:32:41,429 --> 02:32:41,439
entity actually is a different causal
 

9339
02:32:41,439 --> 02:32:43,190
entity actually is a different causal
force in the universe

9340
02:32:43,190 --> 02:32:43,200
force in the universe
 

9341
02:32:43,200 --> 02:32:45,349
force in the universe
and it's intrinsic and local property of

9342
02:32:45,349 --> 02:32:45,359
and it's intrinsic and local property of
 

9343
02:32:45,359 --> 02:32:46,469
and it's intrinsic and local property of
that system

9344
02:32:46,469 --> 02:32:46,479
that system
 

9345
02:32:46,479 --> 02:32:49,270
that system
there's a greater number of distributed

9346
02:32:49,270 --> 02:32:49,280
there's a greater number of distributed
 

9347
02:32:49,280 --> 02:32:50,309
there's a greater number of distributed
agents

9348
02:32:50,309 --> 02:32:50,319
agents
 

9349
02:32:50,319 --> 02:32:52,230
agents
like are you always creating more and

9350
02:32:52,230 --> 02:32:52,240
like are you always creating more and
 

9351
02:32:52,240 --> 02:32:54,469
like are you always creating more and
more individuality

9352
02:32:54,469 --> 02:32:54,479
more individuality
 

9353
02:32:54,479 --> 02:32:55,910
more individuality
kind of

9354
02:32:55,910 --> 02:32:55,920
kind of
 

9355
02:32:55,920 --> 02:32:57,349
kind of
i i would say you're creating more

9356
02:32:57,349 --> 02:32:57,359
i i would say you're creating more
 

9357
02:32:57,359 --> 02:33:00,389
i i would say you're creating more
causal power but so cause of power

9358
02:33:00,389 --> 02:33:00,399
causal power but so cause of power
 

9359
02:33:00,399 --> 02:33:02,710
causal power but so cause of power
the word consciousness is is the cause

9360
02:33:02,710 --> 02:33:02,720
the word consciousness is is the cause
 

9361
02:33:02,720 --> 02:33:04,389
the word consciousness is is the cause
of power somehow correlated with

9362
02:33:04,389 --> 02:33:04,399
of power somehow correlated with
 

9363
02:33:04,399 --> 02:33:06,150
of power somehow correlated with
consciousness i mean that that's why i

9364
02:33:06,150 --> 02:33:06,160
consciousness i mean that that's why i
 

9365
02:33:06,160 --> 02:33:07,670
consciousness i mean that that's why i
have this conception of consciousness

9366
02:33:07,670 --> 02:33:07,680
have this conception of consciousness
 

9367
02:33:07,680 --> 02:33:09,270
have this conception of consciousness
being related to imagination because the

9368
02:33:09,270 --> 02:33:09,280
being related to imagination because the
 

9369
02:33:09,280 --> 02:33:11,270
being related to imagination because the
more that we can imagine can happen and

9370
02:33:11,270 --> 02:33:11,280
more that we can imagine can happen and
 

9371
02:33:11,280 --> 02:33:13,349
more that we can imagine can happen and
the more counter-factual possibilities

9372
02:33:13,349 --> 02:33:13,359
the more counter-factual possibilities
 

9373
02:33:13,359 --> 02:33:15,270
the more counter-factual possibilities
you have in mind the more you can

9374
02:33:15,270 --> 02:33:15,280
you have in mind the more you can
 

9375
02:33:15,280 --> 02:33:17,110
you have in mind the more you can
actually implement and somehow free will

9376
02:33:17,110 --> 02:33:17,120
actually implement and somehow free will
 

9377
02:33:17,120 --> 02:33:18,309
actually implement and somehow free will
is also at the intersection of the

9378
02:33:18,309 --> 02:33:18,319
is also at the intersection of the
 

9379
02:33:18,319 --> 02:33:20,710
is also at the intersection of the
counter factual becoming the actual

9380
02:33:20,710 --> 02:33:20,720
counter factual becoming the actual
 

9381
02:33:20,720 --> 02:33:23,349
counter factual becoming the actual
um so can you elaborate on that a little

9382
02:33:23,349 --> 02:33:23,359
um so can you elaborate on that a little
 

9383
02:33:23,359 --> 02:33:24,710
um so can you elaborate on that a little
bit that consciousness in his

9384
02:33:24,710 --> 02:33:24,720
bit that consciousness in his
 

9385
02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:26,790
bit that consciousness in his
imagination i don't know exactly how to

9386
02:33:26,790 --> 02:33:26,800
imagination i don't know exactly how to
 

9387
02:33:26,800 --> 02:33:29,190
imagination i don't know exactly how to
articulate it and i'm sure people take

9388
02:33:29,190 --> 02:33:29,200
articulate it and i'm sure people take
 

9389
02:33:29,200 --> 02:33:30,710
articulate it and i'm sure people take
you know aim at certain things i'm

9390
02:33:30,710 --> 02:33:30,720
you know aim at certain things i'm
 

9391
02:33:30,720 --> 02:33:32,230
you know aim at certain things i'm
saying but i think the language is

9392
02:33:32,230 --> 02:33:32,240
saying but i think the language is
 

9393
02:33:32,240 --> 02:33:34,630
saying but i think the language is
really imprecise so i'm not the best way

9394
02:33:34,630 --> 02:33:34,640
really imprecise so i'm not the best way
 

9395
02:33:34,640 --> 02:33:36,309
really imprecise so i'm not the best way
to really it's really interesting like

9396
02:33:36,309 --> 02:33:36,319
to really it's really interesting like
 

9397
02:33:36,319 --> 02:33:39,510
to really it's really interesting like
what is imagination and what is it uh

9398
02:33:39,510 --> 02:33:39,520
what is imagination and what is it uh
 

9399
02:33:39,520 --> 02:33:41,510
what is imagination and what is it uh
what role does it play

9400
02:33:41,510 --> 02:33:41,520
what role does it play
 

9401
02:33:41,520 --> 02:33:43,830
what role does it play
in the human experience in experience of

9402
02:33:43,830 --> 02:33:43,840
in the human experience in experience of
 

9403
02:33:43,840 --> 02:33:45,190
in the human experience in experience of
any yeah

9404
02:33:45,190 --> 02:33:45,200
any yeah
 

9405
02:33:45,200 --> 02:33:46,790
any yeah
i love imagination i think it's like the

9406
02:33:46,790 --> 02:33:46,800
i love imagination i think it's like the
 

9407
02:33:46,800 --> 02:33:49,670
i love imagination i think it's like the
most amazing uh thing we do but i guess

9408
02:33:49,670 --> 02:33:49,680
most amazing uh thing we do but i guess
 

9409
02:33:49,680 --> 02:33:51,429
most amazing uh thing we do but i guess
one way i would think about it is we

9410
02:33:51,429 --> 02:33:51,439
one way i would think about it is we
 

9411
02:33:51,439 --> 02:33:52,790
one way i would think about it is we
talked about the transition to life

9412
02:33:52,790 --> 02:33:52,800
talked about the transition to life
 

9413
02:33:52,800 --> 02:33:55,349
talked about the transition to life
being the universe acquiring memory and

9414
02:33:55,349 --> 02:33:55,359
being the universe acquiring memory and
 

9415
02:33:55,359 --> 02:33:56,550
being the universe acquiring memory and
life does something really interesting

9416
02:33:56,550 --> 02:33:56,560
life does something really interesting
 

9417
02:33:56,560 --> 02:33:58,710
life does something really interesting
just think about biology generally it

9418
02:33:58,710 --> 02:33:58,720
just think about biology generally it
 

9419
02:33:58,720 --> 02:34:00,630
just think about biology generally it
remembers states of the past to adapt to

9420
02:34:00,630 --> 02:34:00,640
remembers states of the past to adapt to
 

9421
02:34:00,640 --> 02:34:03,030
remembers states of the past to adapt to
things that happen in the future so so

9422
02:34:03,030 --> 02:34:03,040
things that happen in the future so so
 

9423
02:34:03,040 --> 02:34:04,389
things that happen in the future so so
the longer life has evolved on this

9424
02:34:04,389 --> 02:34:04,399
the longer life has evolved on this
 

9425
02:34:04,399 --> 02:34:05,830
the longer life has evolved on this
planet the deeper that past is the more

9426
02:34:05,830 --> 02:34:05,840
planet the deeper that past is the more
 

9427
02:34:05,840 --> 02:34:07,670
planet the deeper that past is the more
memory we have the more kinds of

9428
02:34:07,670 --> 02:34:07,680
memory we have the more kinds of
 

9429
02:34:07,680 --> 02:34:10,389
memory we have the more kinds of
organisms and things but what human

9430
02:34:10,389 --> 02:34:10,399
organisms and things but what human
 

9431
02:34:10,399 --> 02:34:11,830
organisms and things but what human
level intelligence has done is quite

9432
02:34:11,830 --> 02:34:11,840
level intelligence has done is quite
 

9433
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:14,070
level intelligence has done is quite
different it's not just that we remember

9434
02:34:14,070 --> 02:34:14,080
different it's not just that we remember
 

9435
02:34:14,080 --> 02:34:15,910
different it's not just that we remember
states that the universe has existed in

9436
02:34:15,910 --> 02:34:15,920
states that the universe has existed in
 

9437
02:34:15,920 --> 02:34:18,070
states that the universe has existed in
before it's that we can imagine ones

9438
02:34:18,070 --> 02:34:18,080
before it's that we can imagine ones
 

9439
02:34:18,080 --> 02:34:19,990
before it's that we can imagine ones
that have never existed and we can

9440
02:34:19,990 --> 02:34:20,000
that have never existed and we can
 

9441
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,469
that have never existed and we can
actually make them come into existence

9442
02:34:22,469 --> 02:34:22,479
actually make them come into existence
 

9443
02:34:22,479 --> 02:34:24,309
actually make them come into existence
and i think that's the most unique

9444
02:34:24,309 --> 02:34:24,319
and i think that's the most unique
 

9445
02:34:24,319 --> 02:34:27,030
and i think that's the most unique
feature about the transition to whatever

9446
02:34:27,030 --> 02:34:27,040
feature about the transition to whatever
 

9447
02:34:27,040 --> 02:34:29,190
feature about the transition to whatever
we are from what life on this planet has

9448
02:34:29,190 --> 02:34:29,200
we are from what life on this planet has
 

9449
02:34:29,200 --> 02:34:31,030
we are from what life on this planet has
been doing for the last four billion

9450
02:34:31,030 --> 02:34:31,040
been doing for the last four billion
 

9451
02:34:31,040 --> 02:34:31,990
been doing for the last four billion
years

9452
02:34:31,990 --> 02:34:32,000
years
 

9453
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:33,190
years
and i think it's deeply related to the

9454
02:34:33,190 --> 02:34:33,200
and i think it's deeply related to the
 

9455
02:34:33,200 --> 02:34:34,950
and i think it's deeply related to the
phenomena we call consciousness yeah i

9456
02:34:34,950 --> 02:34:34,960
phenomena we call consciousness yeah i
 

9457
02:34:34,960 --> 02:34:36,309
phenomena we call consciousness yeah i
was gonna i mean just agree with that i

9458
02:34:36,309 --> 02:34:36,319
was gonna i mean just agree with that i
 

9459
02:34:36,319 --> 02:34:38,150
was gonna i mean just agree with that i
think that consciousness is the ability

9460
02:34:38,150 --> 02:34:38,160
think that consciousness is the ability
 

9461
02:34:38,160 --> 02:34:40,389
think that consciousness is the ability
to generate those counter factuals now

9462
02:34:40,389 --> 02:34:40,399
to generate those counter factuals now
 

9463
02:34:40,399 --> 02:34:41,750
to generate those counter factuals now
whether you can say you know are there

9464
02:34:41,750 --> 02:34:41,760
whether you can say you know are there
 

9465
02:34:41,760 --> 02:34:44,150
whether you can say you know are there
degrees of consciousness i mean and i

9466
02:34:44,150 --> 02:34:44,160
degrees of consciousness i mean and i
 

9467
02:34:44,160 --> 02:34:44,870
degrees of consciousness i mean and i
mean

9468
02:34:44,870 --> 02:34:44,880
mean
 

9469
02:34:44,880 --> 02:34:46,950
mean
i mean i'm i'm sorry

9470
02:34:46,950 --> 02:34:46,960
i mean i'm i'm sorry
 

9471

pan psychists but electrons don't have

9472
02:34:49,110 --> 02:34:49,120
pan psychists but electrons don't have
 

9473
02:34:49,120 --> 02:34:50,630
pan psychists but electrons don't have
counterfactuals although they do have

9474
02:34:50,630 --> 02:34:50,640
counterfactuals although they do have
 

9475
02:34:50,640 --> 02:34:52,309
counterfactuals although they do have
some kind of they are able to search the

9476
02:34:52,309 --> 02:34:52,319
some kind of they are able to search the
 

9477
02:34:52,319 --> 02:34:54,710
some kind of they are able to search the
space and pathways but but i think that

9478
02:34:54,710 --> 02:34:54,720
space and pathways but but i think that
 

9479
02:34:54,720 --> 02:34:56,790
space and pathways but but i think that
there is a very

9480
02:34:56,790 --> 02:34:56,800
there is a very
 

9481
02:34:56,800 --> 02:34:58,950
there is a very
concrete or

9482
02:34:58,950 --> 02:34:58,960
concrete or
 

9483
02:34:58,960 --> 02:35:00,950
concrete or
concrete there's a very specific

9484
02:35:00,950 --> 02:35:00,960
concrete there's a very specific
 

9485
02:35:00,960 --> 02:35:03,750
concrete there's a very specific
property that humans have and i'm and i

9486
02:35:03,750 --> 02:35:03,760
property that humans have and i'm and i
 

9487
02:35:03,760 --> 02:35:05,030
property that humans have and i'm and i
don't know if it's unique to humans i

9488
02:35:05,030 --> 02:35:05,040
don't know if it's unique to humans i
 

9489
02:35:05,040 --> 02:35:07,429
don't know if it's unique to humans i
mean maybe dogs can do it and and and

9490
02:35:07,429 --> 02:35:07,439
mean maybe dogs can do it and and and
 

9491
02:35:07,439 --> 02:35:09,670
mean maybe dogs can do it and and and
birds can do it right and where they are

9492
02:35:09,670 --> 02:35:09,680
birds can do it right and where they are
 

9493
02:35:09,680 --> 02:35:12,150
birds can do it right and where they are
basically solving a problem because

9494
02:35:12,150 --> 02:35:12,160
basically solving a problem because
 

9495
02:35:12,160 --> 02:35:14,469
basically solving a problem because
consciousness was invented or this

9496
02:35:14,469 --> 02:35:14,479
consciousness was invented or this
 

9497
02:35:14,479 --> 02:35:16,230
consciousness was invented or this
abstraction was invented by evolution

9498
02:35:16,230 --> 02:35:16,240
abstraction was invented by evolution
 

9499
02:35:16,240 --> 02:35:18,630
abstraction was invented by evolution
for that for a specific reason

9500
02:35:18,630 --> 02:35:18,640
for that for a specific reason
 

9501
02:35:18,640 --> 02:35:20,630
for that for a specific reason
um and so look the

9502
02:35:20,630 --> 02:35:20,640
um and so look the
 

9503
02:35:20,640 --> 02:35:22,230
um and so look the
one of the reasons why i came to the

9504
02:35:22,230 --> 02:35:22,240
one of the reasons why i came to the
 

9505
02:35:22,240 --> 02:35:24,950
one of the reasons why i came to the
conclusion that time was fundamental was

9506
02:35:24,950 --> 02:35:24,960
conclusion that time was fundamental was
 

9507
02:35:24,960 --> 02:35:28,790
conclusion that time was fundamental was
actually because sarah and i had

9508
02:35:28,790 --> 02:35:28,800
actually because sarah and i had
 

9509
02:35:28,800 --> 02:35:30,710
actually because sarah and i had

9512
02:35:34,870 --> 02:35:34,880

9513
02:35:34,880 --> 02:35:36,870

no i no it goes back to the free will

9514
02:35:36,870 --> 02:35:36,880
no i no it goes back to the free will
 

9515
02:35:36,880 --> 02:35:39,510
no i no it goes back to the free will
thing so i i think that although i've

9516
02:35:39,510 --> 02:35:39,520
thing so i i think that although i've
 

9517
02:35:39,520 --> 02:35:40,870
thing so i i think that although i've
changed my view a bit because there's

9518
02:35:40,870 --> 02:35:40,880
changed my view a bit because there's
 

9519
02:35:40,880 --> 02:35:42,469
changed my view a bit because there's
some really interesting physicists out

9520
02:35:42,469 --> 02:35:42,479
some really interesting physicists out
 

9521
02:35:42,479 --> 02:35:44,389
some really interesting physicists out
there who talks about how the

9522
02:35:44,389 --> 02:35:44,399
there who talks about how the
 

9523
02:35:44,399 --> 02:35:45,750
there who talks about how the

9524
02:35:45,750 --> 02:35:45,760
measurement problem
 

9525
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:48,389
measurement problem
in in in newtonian space but i want to

9526
02:35:48,389 --> 02:35:48,399
in in in newtonian space but i want to
 

9527
02:35:48,399 --> 02:35:49,750
in in in newtonian space but i want to
go there just now because i think i'll

9528
02:35:49,750 --> 02:35:49,760
go there just now because i think i'll
 

9529
02:35:49,760 --> 02:35:51,030
go there just now because i think i'll
mess it up but

9530
02:35:51,030 --> 02:35:51,040
mess it up but
 

9531
02:35:51,040 --> 02:35:52,150
mess it up but
briefly

9532
02:35:52,150 --> 02:35:52,160
briefly
 

9533
02:35:52,160 --> 02:35:53,190
briefly
um

9534
02:35:53,190 --> 02:35:53,200
um
 

9535
02:35:53,200 --> 02:35:55,190
um
i could not see how the universe how we

9536
02:35:55,190 --> 02:35:55,200
i could not see how the universe how we
 

9537
02:35:55,200 --> 02:35:56,469
i could not see how the universe how we
can have free will and i mean this is

9538
02:35:56,469 --> 02:35:56,479
can have free will and i mean this is
 

9539
02:35:56,479 --> 02:35:58,150
can have free will and i mean this is
really boring because like this is like

9540
02:35:58,150 --> 02:35:58,160
really boring because like this is like
 

9541
02:35:58,160 --> 02:35:59,990
really boring because like this is like
this is a well trodden path but

9542
02:35:59,990 --> 02:36:00,000
this is a well trodden path but
 

9543
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,230
this is a well trodden path but
but it's not so boring i suppose it's

9544
02:36:02,230 --> 02:36:02,240
but it's not so boring i suppose it's
 

9545
02:36:02,240 --> 02:36:03,990
but it's not so boring i suppose it's
kind of we just want to be precise

9546
02:36:03,990 --> 02:36:04,000
kind of we just want to be precise
 

9547
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,070
kind of we just want to be precise
if the universe is deterministic how can

9548
02:36:06,070 --> 02:36:06,080
if the universe is deterministic how can
 

9549
02:36:06,080 --> 02:36:07,429
if the universe is deterministic how can
we have free will

9550
02:36:07,429 --> 02:36:07,439
we have free will
 

9551
02:36:07,439 --> 02:36:08,790
we have free will
right so

9552
02:36:08,790 --> 02:36:08,800
right so
 

9553
02:36:08,800 --> 02:36:10,950
right so

uh sarah is a physicist
i think she believes but not believe can

9556
02:36:13,110 --> 02:36:13,120
i think she believes but not believe can
 

9557
02:36:13,120 --> 02:36:15,590
i think she believes but not believe can

there's serotonin i mean she believes in
 

9565
02:36:21,760 --> 02:36:24,070
there's serotonin i mean she believes in

in a deterministic universe
 

9575
02:36:32,080 --> 02:36:33,830
in a deterministic universe
and and then i've

9576
02:36:33,830 --> 02:36:33,840
and and then i've
 

9577
02:36:33,840 --> 02:36:36,950
and and then i've
realized that i i agreed with her that i

9578
02:36:36,950 --> 02:36:36,960
realized that i i agreed with her that i
 

9579
02:36:36,960 --> 02:36:39,110
realized that i i agreed with her that i
do think that free will is a thing

9580
02:36:39,110 --> 02:36:39,120
do think that free will is a thing
 

9581
02:36:39,120 --> 02:36:40,469
do think that free will is a thing
because we are able to search for

9582
02:36:40,469 --> 02:36:40,479
because we are able to search for
 

9583
02:36:40,479 --> 02:36:42,389
because we are able to search for
novelty and then that's where i came to

9584
02:36:42,389 --> 02:36:42,399
novelty and then that's where i came to
 

9585
02:36:42,399 --> 02:36:44,150
novelty and then that's where i came to
the conclusion that time the universe

9586
02:36:44,150 --> 02:36:44,160
the conclusion that time the universe
 

9587
02:36:44,160 --> 02:36:46,550
the conclusion that time the universe
was expanding in terms of novelty and it

9588
02:36:46,550 --> 02:36:46,560
was expanding in terms of novelty and it
 

9589
02:36:46,560 --> 02:36:48,389
was expanding in terms of novelty and it

goes back to that dan dennett essay they
were talking about the free will

were talking about the free will

exists in the present what i mean is
like you are the there was no past there

9604
02:37:01,670 --> 02:37:01,680
like you are the there was no past there
 

9605
02:37:01,680 --> 02:37:03,429
like you are the there was no past there
is only present

9606
02:37:03,429 --> 02:37:03,439
is only present
 

9607
02:37:03,439 --> 02:37:04,790
is only present
that means you are the sum total

9608
02:37:04,790 --> 02:37:04,800
that means you are the sum total
 

9609
02:37:04,800 --> 02:37:06,309
that means you are the sum total
although everything that occurs in the

9610
02:37:06,309 --> 02:37:06,319
although everything that occurs in the
 

9611
02:37:06,319 --> 02:37:08,469
although everything that occurs in the
past is it is manifestly here in the

9612
02:37:08,469 --> 02:37:08,479
past is it is manifestly here in the
 

9613
02:37:08,479 --> 02:37:09,510
past is it is manifestly here in the
present

9614
02:37:09,510 --> 02:37:09,520
present
 

9615
02:37:09,520 --> 02:37:10,550
present
and then

9616
02:37:10,550 --> 02:37:10,560
and then
 

9617
02:37:10,560 --> 02:37:12,790
and then
you have this little echo state in your

9618
02:37:12,790 --> 02:37:12,800
you have this little echo state in your
 

9619
02:37:12,800 --> 02:37:14,630
you have this little echo state in your
consciousness because you're able to

9620
02:37:14,630 --> 02:37:14,640
consciousness because you're able to
 

9621
02:37:14,640 --> 02:37:16,710
consciousness because you're able to
you're able to imagine something without

9622
02:37:16,710 --> 02:37:16,720
you're able to imagine something without
 

9623
02:37:16,720 --> 02:37:19,110
you're able to imagine something without
actualization but the fact you imagine

9624
02:37:19,110 --> 02:37:19,120
actualization but the fact you imagine
 

9625
02:37:19,120 --> 02:37:21,030
actualization but the fact you imagine
it that occurs in electrons and

9626
02:37:21,030 --> 02:37:21,040
it that occurs in electrons and
 

9627
02:37:21,040 --> 02:37:23,110
it that occurs in electrons and
potassium iron flows in your neural

9628
02:37:23,110 --> 02:37:23,120
potassium iron flows in your neural
 

9629
02:37:23,120 --> 02:37:24,790
potassium iron flows in your neural
network in your brain maybe

9630
02:37:24,790 --> 02:37:24,800
network in your brain maybe
 

9631
02:37:24,800 --> 02:37:27,190
network in your brain maybe
consciousness is just the present

9632
02:37:27,190 --> 02:37:27,200
consciousness is just the present
 

9633
02:37:27,200 --> 02:37:30,710
consciousness is just the present
so so somehow you imagine that

9634
02:37:30,710 --> 02:37:30,720
so so somehow you imagine that
 

9635
02:37:30,720 --> 02:37:31,990
so so somehow you imagine that
and then by imagining oh that's good

9636
02:37:31,990 --> 02:37:32,000
and then by imagining oh that's good
 

9637
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,070
and then by imagining oh that's good
yeah um i'm gonna make a robot then do

9638
02:37:34,070 --> 02:37:34,080
yeah um i'm gonna make a robot then do
 

9639
02:37:34,080 --> 02:37:35,510
yeah um i'm gonna make a robot then do
this thing

9640
02:37:35,510 --> 02:37:35,520
this thing
 

9641
02:37:35,520 --> 02:37:37,110
this thing
and program it and then you physically

9642
02:37:37,110 --> 02:37:37,120
and program it and then you physically
 

9643
02:37:37,120 --> 02:37:38,950
and program it and then you physically
then go and do it

9644
02:37:38,950 --> 02:37:38,960
then go and do it
 

9645
02:37:38,960 --> 02:37:41,990
then go and do it
so that changes the future sorry

9646
02:37:41,990 --> 02:37:42,000
so that changes the future sorry
 

9647
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,070
so that changes the future sorry
what's imagination

9648
02:37:44,070 --> 02:37:44,080
what's imagination
 

9649
02:37:44,080 --> 02:37:46,870
what's imagination
does it require the past does it require

9650
02:37:46,870 --> 02:37:46,880
does it require the past does it require
 

9651
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:49,030
does it require the past does it require
the future does it require memory does

9652
02:37:49,030 --> 02:37:49,040
the future does it require memory does
 

9653
02:37:49,040 --> 02:37:51,190
the future does it require memory does
it it's imagination

9654
02:37:51,190 --> 02:37:51,200
it it's imagination
 

9655
02:37:51,200 --> 02:37:53,190
it it's imagination
does it only exist in the moment so

9656
02:37:53,190 --> 02:37:53,200
does it only exist in the moment so
 

9657
02:37:53,200 --> 02:37:55,910
does it only exist in the moment so
imagination is

9658
02:37:55,910 --> 02:37:55,920
imagination is
 

9659
02:37:55,920 --> 02:37:57,990
imagination is
yeah probably it's an instantaneous

9660
02:37:57,990 --> 02:37:58,000
yeah probably it's an instantaneous
 

9661
02:37:58,000 --> 02:37:59,670
yeah probably it's an instantaneous
readout of what's going on you can maybe

9662
02:37:59,670 --> 02:37:59,680
readout of what's going on you can maybe
 

9663
02:37:59,680 --> 02:38:01,429
readout of what's going on you can maybe
your your subconscious brain has been

9664
02:38:01,429 --> 02:38:01,439
your your subconscious brain has been
 

9665
02:38:01,439 --> 02:38:03,429
your your subconscious brain has been
generating all the all the bits for it

9666
02:38:03,429 --> 02:38:03,439
generating all the all the bits for it
 

9667
02:38:03,439 --> 02:38:05,830
generating all the all the bits for it
but no imagination occurs

9668
02:38:05,830 --> 02:38:05,840
but no imagination occurs
 

9669
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:07,270
but no imagination occurs
when you

9670
02:38:07,270 --> 02:38:07,280
when you
 

9671
02:38:07,280 --> 02:38:09,429
when you
in your game engine you you remember the

9672
02:38:09,429 --> 02:38:09,439
in your game engine you you remember the
 

9673
02:38:09,439 --> 02:38:11,190
in your game engine you you remember the
past and you integrate sensory the

9674
02:38:11,190 --> 02:38:11,200
past and you integrate sensory the
 

9675
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:12,630
past and you integrate sensory the
present and you try and work out what

9676
02:38:12,630 --> 02:38:12,640
present and you try and work out what
 

9677
02:38:12,640 --> 02:38:14,469
present and you try and work out what
you want to do in the future and then

9678
02:38:14,469 --> 02:38:14,479
you want to do in the future and then
 

9679
02:38:14,479 --> 02:38:16,469
you want to do in the future and then
you go and make that happen so the

9680
02:38:16,469 --> 02:38:16,479
you go and make that happen so the
 

9681
02:38:16,479 --> 02:38:19,110
you go and make that happen so the
imagination is this is like imagine

9682
02:38:19,110 --> 02:38:19,120
imagination is this is like imagine
 

9683
02:38:19,120 --> 02:38:20,550
imagination is this is like imagine
asking what imagination is about asking

9684
02:38:20,550 --> 02:38:20,560
asking what imagination is about asking
 

9685
02:38:20,560 --> 02:38:22,309
asking what imagination is about asking
what surfing is

9686
02:38:22,309 --> 02:38:22,319
what surfing is
 

9687
02:38:22,319 --> 02:38:24,790
what surfing is
you can see you can surfboard surfer

9688
02:38:24,790 --> 02:38:24,800
you can see you can surfboard surfer
 

9689
02:38:24,800 --> 02:38:27,270
you can see you can surfboard surfer
wave coming in when you're on that wave

9690
02:38:27,270 --> 02:38:27,280
wave coming in when you're on that wave
 

9691
02:38:27,280 --> 02:38:29,429
wave coming in when you're on that wave
and you're surfing

9692
02:38:29,429 --> 02:38:29,439
and you're surfing
 

9693
02:38:29,439 --> 02:38:31,670
and you're surfing
that's where the imagination is i think

9694
02:38:31,670 --> 02:38:31,680
that's where the imagination is i think
 

9695
02:38:31,680 --> 02:38:33,750
that's where the imagination is i think
i think imagination is just accessing

9696
02:38:33,750 --> 02:38:33,760
i think imagination is just accessing
 

9697
02:38:33,760 --> 02:38:35,270
i think imagination is just accessing
things that aren't the present moment in

9698
02:38:35,270 --> 02:38:35,280
things that aren't the present moment in
 

9699
02:38:35,280 --> 02:38:36,790
things that aren't the present moment in
the present moment so like i can i'm

9700
02:38:36,790 --> 02:38:36,800
the present moment so like i can i'm
 

9701
02:38:36,800 --> 02:38:37,910
the present moment so like i can i'm
sitting here and i'm looking at the

9702
02:38:37,910 --> 02:38:37,920
sitting here and i'm looking at the
 

9703
02:38:37,920 --> 02:38:40,309
sitting here and i'm looking at the
table and i can imagine

9704
02:38:40,309 --> 02:38:40,319
table and i can imagine
 

9705
02:38:40,319 --> 02:38:43,190
table and i can imagine
the river in things or whatever it was

9706
02:38:43,190 --> 02:38:43,200
the river in things or whatever it was
 

9707
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:45,590
the river in things or whatever it was
and so it seems to be that it's like

9708
02:38:45,590 --> 02:38:45,600
and so it seems to be that it's like
 

9709
02:38:45,600 --> 02:38:48,309
and so it seems to be that it's like
it's our ability to access

9710
02:38:48,309 --> 02:38:48,319
it's our ability to access
 

9711
02:38:48,319 --> 02:38:50,710
it's our ability to access
things that aren't present but so

9712
02:38:50,710 --> 02:38:50,720
things that aren't present but so
 

9713
02:38:50,720 --> 02:38:53,349
things that aren't present but so
conjure up worlds some of them might be

9714
02:38:53,349 --> 02:38:53,359
conjure up worlds some of them might be
 

9715
02:38:53,359 --> 02:38:55,110
conjure up worlds some of them might be
akin to

9716
02:38:55,110 --> 02:38:55,120
akin to
 

9717
02:38:55,120 --> 02:38:57,190
akin to
something that happened to you recently

9718
02:38:57,190 --> 02:38:57,200
something that happened to you recently
 

9719
02:38:57,200 --> 02:38:58,309
something that happened to you recently
right but they don't have they don't

9720
02:38:58,309 --> 02:38:58,319
right but they don't have they don't
 

9721
02:38:58,319 --> 02:38:59,910
right but they don't have they don't
have to be things that actually happen

9722
02:38:59,910 --> 02:38:59,920
have to be things that actually happen
 

9723
02:38:59,920 --> 02:39:01,510
have to be things that actually happen
in your past and i think this gets back

9724
02:39:01,510 --> 02:39:01,520
in your past and i think this gets back
 

9725
02:39:01,520 --> 02:39:03,429
in your past and i think this gets back
to assembly theory like the way i would

9726
02:39:03,429 --> 02:39:03,439
to assembly theory like the way i would
 

9727
02:39:03,439 --> 02:39:05,429
to assembly theory like the way i would
think about imagination from an assembly

9728
02:39:05,429 --> 02:39:05,439
think about imagination from an assembly
 

9729
02:39:05,439 --> 02:39:07,830
think about imagination from an assembly
theoretic standpoint is i'm a giant

9730
02:39:07,830 --> 02:39:07,840
theoretic standpoint is i'm a giant
 

9731
02:39:07,840 --> 02:39:09,670
theoretic standpoint is i'm a giant
causal graph

9732
02:39:09,670 --> 02:39:09,680
causal graph
 

9733
02:39:09,680 --> 02:39:12,070
causal graph
and i exist in a present moment as a

9734
02:39:12,070 --> 02:39:12,080
and i exist in a present moment as a
 

9735
02:39:12,080 --> 02:39:14,309
and i exist in a present moment as a
particular configuration of sarah

9736
02:39:14,309 --> 02:39:14,319
particular configuration of sarah
 

9737
02:39:14,319 --> 02:39:15,270
particular configuration of sarah
and

9738
02:39:15,270 --> 02:39:15,280
and
 

9739
02:39:15,280 --> 02:39:17,670
and
but there's a lot of i carry a lot of

9740
02:39:17,670 --> 02:39:17,680
but there's a lot of i carry a lot of
 

9741
02:39:17,680 --> 02:39:19,190
but there's a lot of i carry a lot of
evolutionary baggage i have that whole

9742
02:39:19,190 --> 02:39:19,200
evolutionary baggage i have that whole
 

9743
02:39:19,200 --> 02:39:20,870
evolutionary baggage i have that whole
causal history and i can

9744
02:39:20,870 --> 02:39:20,880
causal history and i can
 

9745
02:39:20,880 --> 02:39:23,110
causal history and i can
access parts of it now when you talk

9746
02:39:23,110 --> 02:39:23,120
access parts of it now when you talk
 

9747
02:39:23,120 --> 02:39:24,870
access parts of it now when you talk
about getting to something as complex as

9748
02:39:24,870 --> 02:39:24,880
about getting to something as complex as
 

9749
02:39:24,880 --> 02:39:26,950
about getting to something as complex as
us having as large assembly space as us

9750
02:39:26,950 --> 02:39:26,960
us having as large assembly space as us
 

9751
02:39:26,960 --> 02:39:28,469
us having as large assembly space as us
there's ways of

9752
02:39:28,469 --> 02:39:28,479
there's ways of
 

9753
02:39:28,479 --> 02:39:30,070
there's ways of
like there's a lot of things in that

9754
02:39:30,070 --> 02:39:30,080
like there's a lot of things in that
 

9755
02:39:30,080 --> 02:39:32,550
like there's a lot of things in that
causal graph that have ever actually

9756
02:39:32,550 --> 02:39:32,560
causal graph that have ever actually
 

9757
02:39:32,560 --> 02:39:34,950
causal graph that have ever actually
never existed in the past history of the

9758
02:39:34,950 --> 02:39:34,960
never existed in the past history of the
 

9759
02:39:34,960 --> 02:39:36,230
never existed in the past history of the
universe because like the universe got

9760
02:39:36,230 --> 02:39:36,240
universe because like the universe got
 

9761
02:39:36,240 --> 02:39:38,710
universe because like the universe got
big enough to contain the three of us in

9762
02:39:38,710 --> 02:39:38,720
big enough to contain the three of us in
 

9763
02:39:38,720 --> 02:39:39,830
big enough to contain the three of us in
this room

9764
02:39:39,830 --> 02:39:39,840
this room
 

9765
02:39:39,840 --> 02:39:41,750
this room
in time but

9766
02:39:41,750 --> 02:39:41,760
in time but
 

9767
02:39:41,760 --> 02:39:44,230
in time but
not all the features of each one of us

9768
02:39:44,230 --> 02:39:44,240
not all the features of each one of us
 

9769
02:39:44,240 --> 02:39:45,510
not all the features of each one of us
individually

9770
02:39:45,510 --> 02:39:45,520
individually
 

9771
02:39:45,520 --> 02:39:48,389
individually
have come into existence as physical

9772
02:39:48,389 --> 02:39:48,399
have come into existence as physical
 

9773
02:39:48,399 --> 02:39:49,990
have come into existence as physical
objects we would recognize as individual

9774
02:39:49,990 --> 02:39:50,000
objects we would recognize as individual
 

9775
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:51,190
objects we would recognize as individual
objects this goes back to your point

9776
02:39:51,190 --> 02:39:51,200
objects this goes back to your point
 

9777
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:53,429
objects this goes back to your point
that we actually have to explain why why

9778
02:39:53,429 --> 02:39:53,439
that we actually have to explain why why
 

9779
02:39:53,439 --> 02:39:54,389
that we actually have to explain why why
things

9780
02:39:54,389 --> 02:39:54,399
things
 

9781
02:39:54,399 --> 02:39:56,150
things
actually even look like objects and

9782
02:39:56,150 --> 02:39:56,160
actually even look like objects and
 

9783
02:39:56,160 --> 02:39:57,990
actually even look like objects and
aren't just a smear of

9784
02:39:57,990 --> 02:39:58,000
aren't just a smear of
 

9785
02:39:58,000 --> 02:39:59,270
aren't just a smear of
mass

9786
02:39:59,270 --> 02:39:59,280
mass
 

9787
02:39:59,280 --> 02:40:00,630
mass
um

9788
02:40:00,630 --> 02:40:00,640
um
 

9789
02:40:00,640 --> 02:40:01,990
um
and just on the the free will and

9790
02:40:01,990 --> 02:40:02,000
and just on the the free will and
 

9791
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:03,190
and just on the the free will and
physics thing

9792
02:40:03,190 --> 02:40:03,200
physics thing
 

9793
02:40:03,200 --> 02:40:04,790
physics thing
when you were talking i was i just want

9794
02:40:04,790 --> 02:40:04,800
when you were talking i was i just want
 

9795
02:40:04,800 --> 02:40:05,590
when you were talking i was i just want
to bring this up because i think it's a

9796
02:40:05,590 --> 02:40:05,600
to bring this up because i think it's a
 

9797
02:40:05,600 --> 02:40:07,110
to bring this up because i think it's a
really interesting viewpoint that

9798
02:40:07,110 --> 02:40:07,120
really interesting viewpoint that
 

9799
02:40:07,120 --> 02:40:09,750
really interesting viewpoint that
nicholas jizzin has that um you know

9800
02:40:09,750 --> 02:40:09,760
nicholas jizzin has that um you know
 

9801
02:40:09,760 --> 02:40:11,190
nicholas jizzin has that um you know
like we want to use the laws of physics

9802
02:40:11,190 --> 02:40:11,200
like we want to use the laws of physics
 

9803
02:40:11,200 --> 02:40:12,550
like we want to use the laws of physics
and then say you can't have free will

9804
02:40:12,550 --> 02:40:12,560
and then say you can't have free will
 

9805
02:40:12,560 --> 02:40:14,710
and then say you can't have free will
and his point is you have to have free

9806
02:40:14,710 --> 02:40:14,720
and his point is you have to have free
 

9807
02:40:14,720 --> 02:40:16,389
and his point is you have to have free
will in order to even choose to set up

9808
02:40:16,389 --> 02:40:16,399
will in order to even choose to set up
 

9809
02:40:16,399 --> 02:40:17,750
will in order to even choose to set up
an experiment to test the laws of

9810
02:40:17,750 --> 02:40:17,760
an experiment to test the laws of
 

9811
02:40:17,760 --> 02:40:19,269
an experiment to test the laws of
physics so in some sense free will

9812
02:40:19,269 --> 02:40:19,279
physics so in some sense free will
 

9813
02:40:19,279 --> 02:40:21,190
physics so in some sense free will
should be more fundamental than physics

9814
02:40:21,190 --> 02:40:21,200
should be more fundamental than physics
 

9815
02:40:21,200 --> 02:40:23,510
should be more fundamental than physics
is to because to even do science there's

9816
02:40:23,510 --> 02:40:23,520
is to because to even do science there's
 

9817
02:40:23,520 --> 02:40:25,110
is to because to even do science there's
some assumption

9818
02:40:25,110 --> 02:40:25,120
some assumption
 

9819
02:40:25,120 --> 02:40:25,990
some assumption
that

9820
02:40:25,990 --> 02:40:26,000
that
 

9821
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,710
that
the agents have free will and i always

9822
02:40:28,710 --> 02:40:28,720
the agents have free will and i always
 

9823
02:40:28,720 --> 02:40:30,870
the agents have free will and i always
thought it was really perplexing that

9824
02:40:30,870 --> 02:40:30,880
thought it was really perplexing that
 

9825
02:40:30,880 --> 02:40:32,070
thought it was really perplexing that
um

9826
02:40:32,070 --> 02:40:32,080
um
 

9827
02:40:32,080 --> 02:40:33,830
um
you know physics wants to remove agency

9828
02:40:33,830 --> 02:40:33,840
you know physics wants to remove agency
 

9829
02:40:33,840 --> 02:40:35,110
you know physics wants to remove agency
because the idea that i could do an

9830
02:40:35,110 --> 02:40:35,120
because the idea that i could do an
 

9831
02:40:35,120 --> 02:40:36,870
because the idea that i could do an
experiment here on this part of earth

9832
02:40:36,870 --> 02:40:36,880
experiment here on this part of earth
 

9833
02:40:36,880 --> 02:40:38,150
experiment here on this part of earth
and then i can move somewhere else and

9834
02:40:38,150 --> 02:40:38,160
and then i can move somewhere else and
 

9835
02:40:38,160 --> 02:40:39,750
and then i can move somewhere else and
prepare an identically you know

9836
02:40:39,750 --> 02:40:39,760
prepare an identically you know
 

9837
02:40:39,760 --> 02:40:41,590
prepare an identically you know
identically prepared experiment run an

9838
02:40:41,590 --> 02:40:41,600
identically prepared experiment run an
 

9839
02:40:41,600 --> 02:40:42,950
identically prepared experiment run an
experiment again

9840
02:40:42,950 --> 02:40:42,960
experiment again
 

9841
02:40:42,960 --> 02:40:44,710
experiment again
seems to imply something about the

9842
02:40:44,710 --> 02:40:44,720
seems to imply something about the
 

9843
02:40:44,720 --> 02:40:45,990
seems to imply something about the
structure of our universe that is not

9844
02:40:45,990 --> 02:40:46,000
structure of our universe that is not
 

9845
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:47,590
structure of our universe that is not
encoded in the laws that we're testing

9846
02:40:47,590 --> 02:40:47,600
encoded in the laws that we're testing
 

9847
02:40:47,600 --> 02:40:49,750
encoded in the laws that we're testing
in those experiments

9848
02:40:49,750 --> 02:40:49,760
in those experiments
 

9849
02:40:49,760 --> 02:40:51,349
in those experiments
so this kind of dream of physics that

9850
02:40:51,349 --> 02:40:51,359
so this kind of dream of physics that
 

9851
02:40:51,359 --> 02:40:52,630
so this kind of dream of physics that
you can do multiple experiments

9852
02:40:52,630 --> 02:40:52,640
you can do multiple experiments
 

9853
02:40:52,640 --> 02:40:54,150
you can do multiple experiments
different locations and then validate

9854
02:40:54,150 --> 02:40:54,160
different locations and then validate
 

9855
02:40:54,160 --> 02:40:55,190
different locations and then validate
each other

9856
02:40:55,190 --> 02:40:55,200
each other
 

9857
02:40:55,200 --> 02:40:58,070
each other
um you're saying that's uh that's an

9858
02:40:58,070 --> 02:40:58,080
um you're saying that's uh that's an
 

9859
02:40:58,080 --> 02:41:00,950
um you're saying that's uh that's an
illusion no i'm saying that requires

9860
02:41:00,950 --> 02:41:00,960
illusion no i'm saying that requires
 

9861
02:41:00,960 --> 02:41:02,469
illusion no i'm saying that requires
decision making and free will to be a

9862
02:41:02,469 --> 02:41:02,479
decision making and free will to be a
 

9863
02:41:02,479 --> 02:41:03,990
decision making and free will to be a
real thing i think

9864
02:41:03,990 --> 02:41:04,000
real thing i think
 

9865
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:05,269
real thing i think
like i think that i think the fact that

9866
02:41:05,269 --> 02:41:05,279
like i think that i think the fact that
 

9867
02:41:05,279 --> 02:41:08,469
like i think that i think the fact that
we can do science is not arbitrary and i

9868
02:41:08,469 --> 02:41:08,479
we can do science is not arbitrary and i
 

9869
02:41:08,479 --> 02:41:10,950
we can do science is not arbitrary and i
think people you know the standard canon

9870
02:41:10,950 --> 02:41:10,960
think people you know the standard canon
 

9871
02:41:10,960 --> 02:41:12,230
think people you know the standard canon
in physics would be well you could trace

9872
02:41:12,230 --> 02:41:12,240
in physics would be well you could trace
 

9873
02:41:12,240 --> 02:41:13,269
in physics would be well you could trace
all of that back to the initial

9874
02:41:13,269 --> 02:41:13,279
all of that back to the initial
 

9875
02:41:13,279 --> 02:41:15,030
all of that back to the initial
condition the universe but the whole

9876
02:41:15,030 --> 02:41:15,040
condition the universe but the whole
 

9877
02:41:15,040 --> 02:41:16,950
condition the universe but the whole
point of science is i can imagine doing

9878
02:41:16,950 --> 02:41:16,960
point of science is i can imagine doing
 

9879
02:41:16,960 --> 02:41:18,389
point of science is i can imagine doing
the experiment and i can do it and then

9880
02:41:18,389 --> 02:41:18,399
the experiment and i can do it and then
 

9881
02:41:18,399 --> 02:41:19,590
the experiment and i can do it and then
i can do it again and again and again

9882
02:41:19,590 --> 02:41:19,600
i can do it again and again and again
 

9883
02:41:19,600 --> 02:41:21,590
i can do it again and again and again
all over the place to you imagination

9884
02:41:21,590 --> 02:41:21,600
all over the place to you imagination
 

9885
02:41:21,600 --> 02:41:23,190
all over the place to you imagination
somehow fundamentally

9886
02:41:23,190 --> 02:41:23,200
somehow fundamentally
 

9887
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:25,750
somehow fundamentally
generative of novelty yes so it's not

9888
02:41:25,750 --> 02:41:25,760
generative of novelty yes so it's not
 

9889
02:41:25,760 --> 02:41:27,510
generative of novelty yes so it's not
like the universe could have predicted

9890
02:41:27,510 --> 02:41:27,520
like the universe could have predicted
 

9891
02:41:27,520 --> 02:41:29,670
like the universe could have predicted
the things you imagined imagination

9892
02:41:29,670 --> 02:41:29,680
the things you imagined imagination
 

9893
02:41:29,680 --> 02:41:31,349
the things you imagined imagination
super so coming back to novelty i think

9894
02:41:31,349 --> 02:41:31,359
super so coming back to novelty i think
 

9895
02:41:31,359 --> 02:41:33,349
super so coming back to novelty i think
novelty can exist outside of imagination

9896
02:41:33,349 --> 02:41:33,359
novelty can exist outside of imagination
 

9897
02:41:33,359 --> 02:41:34,710
novelty can exist outside of imagination
but it supercharges it it's another

9898
02:41:34,710 --> 02:41:34,720
but it supercharges it it's another
 

9899
02:41:34,720 --> 02:41:36,150
but it supercharges it it's another
transition i think

9900
02:41:36,150 --> 02:41:36,160
transition i think
 

9901
02:41:36,160 --> 02:41:37,510
transition i think
i mean i would say

9902
02:41:37,510 --> 02:41:37,520
i mean i would say
 

9903
02:41:37,520 --> 02:41:38,870
i mean i would say
i mean this may be a boring statement

9904
02:41:38,870 --> 02:41:38,880
i mean this may be a boring statement
 

9905
02:41:38,880 --> 02:41:40,710
i mean this may be a boring statement
but i would say that they're sorry i'm

9906
02:41:40,710 --> 02:41:40,720
but i would say that they're sorry i'm
 

9907
02:41:40,720 --> 02:41:42,230
but i would say that they're sorry i'm
not sure it's a heart these are hard

9908
02:41:42,230 --> 02:41:42,240
not sure it's a heart these are hard
 

9909
02:41:42,240 --> 02:41:43,750
not sure it's a heart these are hard
questions yeah i mean i think the fact

9910
02:41:43,750 --> 02:41:43,760
questions yeah i mean i think the fact
 

9911
02:41:43,760 --> 02:41:46,070
questions yeah i mean i think the fact
that objects exist is yet another proof

9912
02:41:46,070 --> 02:41:46,080
that objects exist is yet another proof
 

9913
02:41:46,080 --> 02:41:46,790
that objects exist is yet another proof
that

9914
02:41:46,790 --> 02:41:46,800
that
 

9915
02:41:46,800 --> 02:41:49,110
that
that time is fundamental and novelty

9916
02:41:49,110 --> 02:41:49,120
that time is fundamental and novelty
 

9917
02:41:49,120 --> 02:41:50,389
that time is fundamental and novelty
exists right

9918
02:41:50,389 --> 02:41:50,399
exists right
 

9919
02:41:50,399 --> 02:41:51,910
exists right
because i think again

9920
02:41:51,910 --> 02:41:51,920
because i think again
 

9921
02:41:51,920 --> 02:41:53,429
because i think again
if you ask a physicist to write down in

9922
02:41:53,429 --> 02:41:53,439
if you ask a physicist to write down in
 

9923
02:41:53,439 --> 02:41:55,429
if you ask a physicist to write down in
their infinite bible of the universe

02:42:15,040 --> 02:42:16,710
of pretty pictures
it's really interesting that they they

9944
02:42:16,710 --> 02:42:16,720
it's really interesting that they they
 

9945
02:42:16,720 --> 02:42:18,870
it's really interesting that they they
cope with the enormity of the universe

9946
02:42:18,870 --> 02:42:18,880
cope with the enormity of the universe
 

9947
02:42:18,880 --> 02:42:20,150
cope with the enormity of the universe
by saying well it's all their

9948
02:42:20,150 --> 02:42:20,160
by saying well it's all their
 

9949
02:42:20,160 --> 02:42:22,630
by saying well it's all their
mathematics it all exists right and and

9950
02:42:22,630 --> 02:42:22,640
mathematics it all exists right and and
 

9951
02:42:22,640 --> 02:42:24,150
mathematics it all exists right and and
i would say that

9952
02:42:24,150 --> 02:42:24,160
i would say that
 

9953
02:42:24,160 --> 02:42:25,750
i would say that
that's why i'm excited about the future

9954
02:42:25,750 --> 02:42:25,760
that's why i'm excited about the future
 

9955
02:42:25,760 --> 02:42:27,349
that's why i'm excited about the future
of the universe because it

9956
02:42:27,349 --> 02:42:27,359
of the universe because it
 

9957
02:42:27,359 --> 02:42:30,070
of the universe because it
it although it is somehow dependent upon

9958
02:42:30,070 --> 02:42:30,080
it although it is somehow dependent upon
 

9959
02:42:30,080 --> 02:42:31,269
it although it is somehow dependent upon
the past

9960
02:42:31,269 --> 02:42:31,279
the past
 

9961
02:42:31,279 --> 02:42:33,750
the past
it is not constrained

9962
02:42:33,750 --> 02:42:33,760
it is not constrained
 

9963
02:42:33,760 --> 02:42:36,550
it is not constrained
just by the past

9964
02:42:36,550 --> 02:42:36,560
just by the past
 

9965
02:42:36,560 --> 02:42:38,550
just by the past
which is kind of mad

9966
02:42:38,550 --> 02:42:38,560
which is kind of mad
 

9967
02:42:38,560 --> 02:42:41,110
which is kind of mad
yeah that's what free will is it's not

9968
02:42:41,110 --> 02:42:41,120
yeah that's what free will is it's not
 

9969
02:42:41,120 --> 02:42:42,950
yeah that's what free will is it's not
constrained by the past it's dependent

9970
02:42:42,950 --> 02:42:42,960
constrained by the past it's dependent
 

9971
02:42:42,960 --> 02:42:44,230
constrained by the past it's dependent
on the past

9972
02:42:44,230 --> 02:42:44,240
on the past
 

9973
02:42:44,240 --> 02:42:46,550
on the past
this moment it's not just dependent this

9974
02:42:46,550 --> 02:42:46,560
this moment it's not just dependent this
 

9975
02:42:46,560 --> 02:42:48,870
this moment it's not just dependent this
moment is the past and yet it has the

9976
02:42:48,870 --> 02:42:48,880
moment is the past and yet it has the
 

9977
02:42:48,880 --> 02:42:51,110
moment is the past and yet it has the
capacity to generate a totally

9978
02:42:51,110 --> 02:42:51,120
capacity to generate a totally
 

9979
02:42:51,120 --> 02:42:53,349
capacity to generate a totally
unpredictable future i mean the other

9980
02:42:53,349 --> 02:42:53,359
unpredictable future i mean the other
 

9981
02:42:53,359 --> 02:42:54,710
unpredictable future i mean the other
thing i would say is super important for

9982
02:42:54,710 --> 02:42:54,720
thing i would say is super important for
 

9983
02:42:54,720 --> 02:42:57,190
thing i would say is super important for
human beings right human beings have

9984
02:42:57,190 --> 02:42:57,200
human beings right human beings have
 

9985
02:42:57,200 --> 02:42:59,190
human beings right human beings have
actually very little causal control in

9986
02:42:59,190 --> 02:42:59,200
actually very little causal control in
 

9987
02:42:59,200 --> 02:43:00,550
actually very little causal control in
the future

9988
02:43:00,550 --> 02:43:00,560
the future
 

9989
02:43:00,560 --> 02:43:03,349
the future
i realized this the other week

9990
02:43:03,349 --> 02:43:03,359
i realized this the other week
 

9991
02:43:03,359 --> 02:43:05,190
i realized this the other week
yeah yeah so what happened so this is

9992
02:43:05,190 --> 02:43:05,200
yeah yeah so what happened so this is
 

9993
02:43:05,200 --> 02:43:07,190
yeah yeah so what happened so this is
what i think it is the way

9994
02:43:07,190 --> 02:43:07,200
what i think it is the way
 

9995
02:43:07,200 --> 02:43:09,349
what i think it is the way
by reinterpreting your past i mean talk

9996
02:43:09,349 --> 02:43:09,359
by reinterpreting your past i mean talk
 

9997
02:43:09,359 --> 02:43:11,190
by reinterpreting your past i mean talk
about from a kind of cognitive

9998
02:43:11,190 --> 02:43:11,200
about from a kind of cognitive
 

9999
02:43:11,200 --> 02:43:13,190
about from a kind of cognitive
psychological cognitive point of view by

10000
02:43:13,190 --> 02:43:13,200
psychological cognitive point of view by
 

10001
02:43:13,200 --> 02:43:15,990
psychological cognitive point of view by
reinterpreting your past

10002
02:43:15,990 --> 02:43:16,000
reinterpreting your past
 

10003
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:17,750
reinterpreting your past
in your current mind

10004
02:43:17,750 --> 02:43:17,760
in your current mind
 

10005
02:43:17,760 --> 02:43:19,670
in your current mind
you can actually helps you shape your

10006
02:43:19,670 --> 02:43:19,680
you can actually helps you shape your
 

10007
02:43:19,680 --> 02:43:21,110
you can actually helps you shape your
future again

10008
02:43:21,110 --> 02:43:21,120
future again
 

10009
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:22,870
future again
so you but you you have much more

10010
02:43:22,870 --> 02:43:22,880
so you but you you have much more
 

10011
02:43:22,880 --> 02:43:25,910
so you but you you have much more
freedom to interpret your past to act in

10012
02:43:25,910 --> 02:43:25,920
freedom to interpret your past to act in
 

10013
02:43:25,920 --> 02:43:28,230
freedom to interpret your past to act in
the present to change your future than

10014
02:43:28,230 --> 02:43:28,240
the present to change your future than
 

10015
02:43:28,240 --> 02:43:29,670
the present to change your future than
you do to change your future it may

10016
02:43:29,670 --> 02:43:29,680
you do to change your future it may
 

10017
02:43:29,680 --> 02:43:31,590
you do to change your future it may
sound weird so i'm saying everybody

10018
02:43:31,590 --> 02:43:31,600
sound weird so i'm saying everybody
 

10019
02:43:31,600 --> 02:43:33,750
sound weird so i'm saying everybody
imagine your past think about your past

10020
02:43:33,750 --> 02:43:33,760
imagine your past think about your past
 

10021
02:43:33,760 --> 02:43:36,389
imagine your past think about your past
reinterpret your past in the nicest way

10022
02:43:36,389 --> 02:43:36,399
reinterpret your past in the nicest way
 

10023
02:43:36,399 --> 02:43:37,349
reinterpret your past in the nicest way
you can

10024
02:43:37,349 --> 02:43:37,359
you can
 

10025
02:43:37,359 --> 02:43:39,429
you can
then imagine what you can do next or

10026
02:43:39,429 --> 02:43:39,439
then imagine what you can do next or
 

10027
02:43:39,439 --> 02:43:41,030
then imagine what you can do next or
imagine your past in a more negative way

10028
02:43:41,030 --> 02:43:41,040
imagine your past in a more negative way
 

10029
02:43:41,040 --> 02:43:42,309
imagine your past in a more negative way
and what you do next and look at those

10030
02:43:42,309 --> 02:43:42,319
and what you do next and look at those
 

10031
02:43:42,319 --> 02:43:44,950
and what you do next and look at those
two counterfactuals they're different

10032
02:43:44,950 --> 02:43:44,960
two counterfactuals they're different
 

10033
02:43:44,960 --> 02:43:45,990
two counterfactuals they're different
yeah it's fascinating i mean daniel

10034
02:43:45,990 --> 02:43:46,000
yeah it's fascinating i mean daniel
 

10035
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:47,510
yeah it's fascinating i mean daniel
o'connor talks about this that most of

10036
02:43:47,510 --> 02:43:47,520
o'connor talks about this that most of
 

10037
02:43:47,520 --> 02:43:49,590
o'connor talks about this that most of
our life is lived in our memories it's

10038
02:43:49,590 --> 02:43:49,600
our life is lived in our memories it's
 

10039
02:43:49,600 --> 02:43:51,429
our life is lived in our memories it's
interesting because you can essentially

10040
02:43:51,429 --> 02:43:51,439
interesting because you can essentially
 

10041
02:43:51,439 --> 02:43:53,670
interesting because you can essentially
in imagination choose the life you live

10042
02:43:53,670 --> 02:43:53,680
in imagination choose the life you live
 

10043
02:43:53,680 --> 02:43:57,429
in imagination choose the life you live
so maybe free will exist in imagination

10044
02:43:57,429 --> 02:43:57,439
so maybe free will exist in imagination
 

10045
02:43:57,439 --> 02:44:00,309
so maybe free will exist in imagination
choices are made in your imagination

10046
02:44:00,309 --> 02:44:00,319
choices are made in your imagination
 

10047
02:44:00,319 --> 02:44:02,790
choices are made in your imagination
and that results in you basically able

10048
02:44:02,790 --> 02:44:02,800
and that results in you basically able
 

10049
02:44:02,800 --> 02:44:05,190
and that results in you basically able
to control how the future unrolls

10050
02:44:05,190 --> 02:44:05,200
to control how the future unrolls
 

10051
02:44:05,200 --> 02:44:06,790
to control how the future unrolls
because you're like

10052
02:44:06,790 --> 02:44:06,800
because you're like
 

10053
02:44:06,800 --> 02:44:08,230
because you're like
imagining

10054
02:44:08,230 --> 02:44:08,240
imagining
 

10055
02:44:08,240 --> 02:44:10,070
imagining
like reinterpreting constantly the

10056
02:44:10,070 --> 02:44:10,080
like reinterpreting constantly the
 

10057
02:44:10,080 --> 02:44:11,830
like reinterpreting constantly the
things that happen to you exactly so

10058
02:44:11,830 --> 02:44:11,840
things that happen to you exactly so
 

10059
02:44:11,840 --> 02:44:13,670
things that happen to you exactly so
you're the if you want to increase your

10060
02:44:13,670 --> 02:44:13,680
you're the if you want to increase your
 

10061
02:44:13,680 --> 02:44:15,190
you're the if you want to increase your
amount of free will

10062
02:44:15,190 --> 02:44:15,200
amount of free will
 

10063
02:44:15,200 --> 02:44:16,389
amount of free will
those people that have most i don't

10064
02:44:16,389 --> 02:44:16,399
those people that have most i don't
 

10065
02:44:16,399 --> 02:44:17,670
those people that have most i don't
think everyone has equal amounts of

10066
02:44:17,670 --> 02:44:17,680
think everyone has equal amounts of
 

10067
02:44:17,680 --> 02:44:21,030
think everyone has equal amounts of
agency because of uh because of our sad

10068
02:44:21,030 --> 02:44:21,040
agency because of uh because of our sad
 

10069
02:44:21,040 --> 02:44:23,429
agency because of uh because of our sad
sad constraints whether whether you know

10070
02:44:23,429 --> 02:44:23,439
sad constraints whether whether you know
 

10071
02:44:23,439 --> 02:44:25,349
sad constraints whether whether you know
happenstance with health

10072
02:44:25,349 --> 02:44:25,359
happenstance with health
 

10073

10079
02:44:30,160 --> 02:44:32,309
but
you're those of us that have the ability

02:44:32,309 --> 02:44:32,319
you're those of us that have the ability
 

10081
02:44:32,319 --> 02:44:34,790
you're those of us that have the ability
to go back and reinterpret our past

10082
02:44:34,790 --> 02:44:34,800
to go back and reinterpret our past
 

10083
02:44:34,800 --> 02:44:36,630
to go back and reinterpret our past
and and and use that to change the

02:44:36,630 --> 02:44:36,640
and and and use that to change the
 

10085
02:44:36,640 --> 02:44:37,830
and and and use that to change the
future

10086
02:44:37,830 --> 02:44:37,840
future
 

10087
02:44:37,840 --> 02:44:40,950
future
are the ones that exert most agency in

10088
02:44:40,950 --> 02:44:40,960
are the ones that exert most agency in
 

10089
02:44:40,960 --> 02:44:42,630
are the ones that exert most agency in
the present

10090
02:44:42,630 --> 02:44:42,640
the present
 

10091
02:44:42,640 --> 02:44:46,070
the present
and i i want to i want to achieve higher

10092
02:44:46,070 --> 02:44:46,080
and i i want to i want to achieve higher
 

10093
02:44:46,080 --> 02:44:48,230
and i i want to i want to achieve higher
degrees of agency and enable everyone

10094
02:44:48,230 --> 02:44:48,240
degrees of agency and enable everyone
 

10095
02:44:48,240 --> 02:44:50,870
degrees of agency and enable everyone
else to do that as well to have more fun

10096
02:44:50,870 --> 02:44:50,880
else to do that as well to have more fun
 

10097
02:44:50,880 --> 02:44:53,429
else to do that as well to have more fun
in the universe then we'll hit that peak

10098
02:44:53,429 --> 02:44:53,439
in the universe then we'll hit that peak
 

10099
02:44:53,439 --> 02:44:55,190
in the universe then we'll hit that peak
maximum fun i don't think there's ever

10100
02:44:55,190 --> 02:44:55,200
maximum fun i don't think there's ever
 

10101
02:44:55,200 --> 02:44:56,790
maximum fun i don't think there's ever
going to be a maximum pop but i think

10102
02:44:56,790 --> 02:44:56,800
going to be a maximum pop but i think
 

10103
02:44:56,800 --> 02:44:58,309
going to be a maximum pop but i think
it's the wonderful thing about the

10104
02:44:58,309 --> 02:44:58,319
it's the wonderful thing about the
 

10105
02:44:58,319 --> 02:44:59,510
it's the wonderful thing about the
future is always always gonna be more

10106
02:44:59,510 --> 02:44:59,520
future is always always gonna be more
 

10107
02:44:59,520 --> 02:45:02,950
future is always always gonna be more
fun yeah you i think again going back to

10108
02:45:02,950 --> 02:45:02,960
fun yeah you i think again going back to
 

10109
02:45:02,960 --> 02:45:03,910
fun yeah you i think again going back to
um

10110
02:45:03,910 --> 02:45:03,920
um
 

10111
02:45:03,920 --> 02:45:06,389
um
to twitter i think you lee tweeted

10112
02:45:06,389 --> 02:45:06,399
to twitter i think you lee tweeted
 

10113
02:45:06,399 --> 02:45:08,389
to twitter i think you lee tweeted
something about being a life maximalist

10114
02:45:08,389 --> 02:45:08,399
something about being a life maximalist
 

10115
02:45:08,399 --> 02:45:09,910
something about being a life maximalist
that you want to maximize the number of

10116
02:45:09,910 --> 02:45:09,920
that you want to maximize the number of
 

10117
02:45:09,920 --> 02:45:10,790
that you want to maximize the number of
life

10118
02:45:10,790 --> 02:45:10,800
life
 

10119
02:45:10,800 --> 02:45:12,710
life
the the amount of life in the universe

10120
02:45:12,710 --> 02:45:12,720
the the amount of life in the universe
 

10121
02:45:12,720 --> 02:45:16,550
the the amount of life in the universe
so and you know that's the more general

10122
02:45:16,550 --> 02:45:16,560
so and you know that's the more general
 

10123
02:45:16,560 --> 02:45:17,990
so and you know that's the more general
version of that

10124
02:45:17,990 --> 02:45:18,000
version of that
 

10125
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:19,830
version of that
goal is to maximize the amount of fun in

10126
02:45:19,830 --> 02:45:19,840
goal is to maximize the amount of fun in
 

10127
02:45:19,840 --> 02:45:21,590
goal is to maximize the amount of fun in
the universe because life is a subset of

10128
02:45:21,590 --> 02:45:21,600
the universe because life is a subset of
 

10129
02:45:21,600 --> 02:45:24,150
the universe because life is a subset of
fun all kinds of i suppose they're

10130
02:45:24,150 --> 02:45:24,160
fun all kinds of i suppose they're
 

10131
02:45:24,160 --> 02:45:25,910
fun all kinds of i suppose they're
either correlated or exactly equal i

10132
02:45:25,910 --> 02:45:25,920
either correlated or exactly equal i
 

10133
02:45:25,920 --> 02:45:26,870
either correlated or exactly equal i
don't know

10134
02:45:26,870 --> 02:45:26,880
don't know
 

10135
02:45:26,880 --> 02:45:29,269
don't know
anyway speaking of fun let me ask you

10136
02:45:29,269 --> 02:45:29,279
anyway speaking of fun let me ask you
 

10137
02:45:29,279 --> 02:45:32,150
anyway speaking of fun let me ask you
about alien sightings

10138
02:45:32,150 --> 02:45:32,160
about alien sightings
 

10139
02:45:32,160 --> 02:45:33,830
about alien sightings
so there's been quite a bit of ufo

10140
02:45:33,830 --> 02:45:33,840
so there's been quite a bit of ufo
 

10141
02:45:33,840 --> 02:45:36,150
so there's been quite a bit of ufo
sightings and all that kind of stuff

10142
02:45:36,150 --> 02:45:36,160
sightings and all that kind of stuff
 

10143
02:45:36,160 --> 02:45:38,309
sightings and all that kind of stuff
what do you think

10144
02:45:38,309 --> 02:45:38,319
what do you think
 

10145
02:45:38,319 --> 02:45:41,429
what do you think
would be the first time

10146
02:45:41,429 --> 02:45:41,439
would be the first time
 

10147
02:45:41,439 --> 02:45:45,830
would be the first time
when humans cite aliens see aliens in a

10148
02:45:45,830 --> 02:45:45,840
when humans cite aliens see aliens in a
 

10149
02:45:45,840 --> 02:45:46,870
when humans cite aliens see aliens in a
sort of

10150
02:45:46,870 --> 02:45:46,880
sort of
 

10151
02:45:46,880 --> 02:45:49,269
sort of
unquestionable way

10152
02:45:49,269 --> 02:45:49,279
unquestionable way
 

10153
02:45:49,279 --> 02:45:50,230
unquestionable way
this

10154
02:45:50,230 --> 02:45:50,240
this
 

10155
02:45:50,240 --> 02:45:54,150
this
extremely strong and arguable way

10156
02:45:54,150 --> 02:45:54,160
extremely strong and arguable way
 

10157
02:45:54,160 --> 02:45:56,870
extremely strong and arguable way
we've made contact with aliens

10158
02:45:56,870 --> 02:45:56,880
we've made contact with aliens
 

10159
02:45:56,880 --> 02:45:59,510
we've made contact with aliens
sarah what would it look like obviously

10160
02:45:59,510 --> 02:45:59,520
sarah what would it look like obviously
 

10161
02:45:59,520 --> 02:46:02,469
sarah what would it look like obviously
the the the space of possibilities is is

10162
02:46:02,469 --> 02:46:02,479
the the the space of possibilities is is
 

10163
02:46:02,479 --> 02:46:03,750
the the the space of possibilities is is
huge here but

10164
02:46:03,750 --> 02:46:03,760
huge here but
 

10165
02:46:03,760 --> 02:46:05,510
huge here but
if you were to kind of look into the

10166
02:46:05,510 --> 02:46:05,520
if you were to kind of look into the
 

10167
02:46:05,520 --> 02:46:07,190
if you were to kind of look into the
future what would that look like would

10168
02:46:07,190 --> 02:46:07,200
future what would that look like would
 

10169
02:46:07,200 --> 02:46:10,150
future what would that look like would
it be inklings of ufos here and there

10170
02:46:10,150 --> 02:46:10,160
it be inklings of ufos here and there
 

10171
02:46:10,160 --> 02:46:13,510
it be inklings of ufos here and there
that slowly unravel a mystery

10172
02:46:13,510 --> 02:46:13,520
that slowly unravel a mystery
 

10173
02:46:13,520 --> 02:46:16,630
that slowly unravel a mystery
or or would it be like an obvious

10174
02:46:16,630 --> 02:46:16,640
or or would it be like an obvious
 

10175
02:46:16,640 --> 02:46:18,870
or or would it be like an obvious
overwhelming signal

10176
02:46:18,870 --> 02:46:18,880
overwhelming signal
 

10177
02:46:18,880 --> 02:46:20,870
overwhelming signal
so i think we have an obsession with

10178
02:46:20,870 --> 02:46:20,880
so i think we have an obsession with
 

10179
02:46:20,880 --> 02:46:23,030
so i think we have an obsession with
making contact with events

10180
02:46:23,030 --> 02:46:23,040
making contact with events
 

10181
02:46:23,040 --> 02:46:24,389
making contact with events
so uh

10182
02:46:24,389 --> 02:46:24,399
so uh
 

10183
02:46:24,399 --> 02:46:26,070
so uh
what i mean by that is

10184
02:46:26,070 --> 02:46:26,080
what i mean by that is
 

10185
02:46:26,080 --> 02:46:27,670
what i mean by that is
you know like people have a ufo sighting

10186
02:46:27,670 --> 02:46:27,680
you know like people have a ufo sighting
 

10187
02:46:27,680 --> 02:46:29,349
you know like people have a ufo sighting
they make contact

10188
02:46:29,349 --> 02:46:29,359
they make contact
 

10189
02:46:29,359 --> 02:46:31,510
they make contact
um and i always think

10190
02:46:31,510 --> 02:46:31,520
um and i always think
 

10191
02:46:31,520 --> 02:46:32,389
um and i always think
you know

10192
02:46:32,389 --> 02:46:32,399
you know
 

10193
02:46:32,399 --> 02:46:34,710
you know
what's interesting to me about

10194
02:46:34,710 --> 02:46:34,720
what's interesting to me about
 

10195
02:46:34,720 --> 02:46:37,030
what's interesting to me about
the ufo narratives right now is not that

10196
02:46:37,030 --> 02:46:37,040
the ufo narratives right now is not that
 

10197
02:46:37,040 --> 02:46:38,870
the ufo narratives right now is not that
i have a disbelief about

10198
02:46:38,870 --> 02:46:38,880
i have a disbelief about
 

10199
02:46:38,880 --> 02:46:40,469
i have a disbelief about
what people are experiencing or feeling

10200
02:46:40,469 --> 02:46:40,479
what people are experiencing or feeling
 

10201
02:46:40,479 --> 02:46:42,230
what people are experiencing or feeling
but like the discussion right now is

10202
02:46:42,230 --> 02:46:42,240
but like the discussion right now is
 

10203
02:46:42,240 --> 02:46:43,190
but like the discussion right now is
sort of

10204
02:46:43,190 --> 02:46:43,200
sort of
 

10205
02:46:43,200 --> 02:46:45,670
sort of
at the level of modern mythology aliens

10206
02:46:45,670 --> 02:46:45,680
at the level of modern mythology aliens
 

10207
02:46:45,680 --> 02:46:47,510
at the level of modern mythology aliens
are our mythos

10208
02:46:47,510 --> 02:46:47,520
are our mythos
 

10209
02:46:47,520 --> 02:46:49,830
are our mythos
in modern culture and and when you treat

10210
02:46:49,830 --> 02:46:49,840
in modern culture and and when you treat
 

10211
02:46:49,840 --> 02:46:52,309
in modern culture and and when you treat
it like that then then i want to think

10212
02:46:52,309 --> 02:46:52,319
it like that then then i want to think
 

10213
02:46:52,319 --> 02:46:55,030
it like that then then i want to think
about when do things that we

10214
02:46:55,030 --> 02:46:55,040
about when do things that we
 

10215
02:46:55,040 --> 02:46:56,950
about when do things that we
traditionally only regularize through

10216
02:46:56,950 --> 02:46:56,960
traditionally only regularize through
 

10217
02:46:56,960 --> 02:46:58,870
traditionally only regularize through
mythology actually become things that

10218
02:46:58,870 --> 02:46:58,880
mythology actually become things that
 

10219
02:46:58,880 --> 02:47:00,870
mythology actually become things that
become standard knowledge so you know

10220
02:47:00,870 --> 02:47:00,880
become standard knowledge so you know
 

10221
02:47:00,880 --> 02:47:03,349
become standard knowledge so you know
like it used to be you know variations

10222
02:47:03,349 --> 02:47:03,359
like it used to be you know variations
 

10223
02:47:03,359 --> 02:47:04,710
like it used to be you know variations
in the climate were described by some

10224
02:47:04,710 --> 02:47:04,720
in the climate were described by some
 

10225
02:47:04,720 --> 02:47:06,150
in the climate were described by some
kind of gods or something and now it's

10226
02:47:06,150 --> 02:47:06,160
kind of gods or something and now it's
 

10227
02:47:06,160 --> 02:47:07,910
kind of gods or something and now it's
like you know our technology picks up an

10228
02:47:07,910 --> 02:47:07,920
like you know our technology picks up an
 

10229
02:47:07,920 --> 02:47:09,990
like you know our technology picks up an
anomaly or someone sees something we say

10230
02:47:09,990 --> 02:47:10,000
anomaly or someone sees something we say
 

10231
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,630
anomaly or someone sees something we say
it's aliens and i think the real thing

10232
02:47:12,630 --> 02:47:12,640
it's aliens and i think the real thing
 

10233
02:47:12,640 --> 02:47:15,429
it's aliens and i think the real thing
is it's not contact with events but like

10234
02:47:15,429 --> 02:47:15,439
is it's not contact with events but like
 

10235
02:47:15,439 --> 02:47:17,349
is it's not contact with events but like
first contact is actually contact with

10236
02:47:17,349 --> 02:47:17,359
first contact is actually contact with
 

10237
02:47:17,359 --> 02:47:18,830
first contact is actually contact with
knowledge of the phenomena or the

10238
02:47:18,830 --> 02:47:18,840
knowledge of the phenomena or the
 

10239
02:47:18,840 --> 02:47:20,790
knowledge of the phenomena or the
explanation and so

10240
02:47:20,790 --> 02:47:20,800
explanation and so
 

10241
02:47:20,800 --> 02:47:22,950
explanation and so
this is very subtle and very abstract

10242
02:47:22,950 --> 02:47:22,960
this is very subtle and very abstract
 

10243
02:47:22,960 --> 02:47:23,670
this is very subtle and very abstract
but

10244
02:47:23,670 --> 02:47:23,680
but
 

10245
02:47:23,680 --> 02:47:25,190
but
when does it become something that we

10246
02:47:25,190 --> 02:47:25,200
when does it become something that we
 

10247
02:47:25,200 --> 02:47:27,190
when does it become something that we
actually understand what it is that

10248
02:47:27,190 --> 02:47:27,200
actually understand what it is that
 

10249
02:47:27,200 --> 02:47:29,269
actually understand what it is that
we're talking about that's first contact

10250
02:47:29,269 --> 02:47:29,279
we're talking about that's first contact
 

10251
02:47:29,279 --> 02:47:31,349
we're talking about that's first contact
it's not would you make the myth would

10252
02:47:31,349 --> 02:47:31,359
it's not would you make the myth would
 

10253
02:47:31,359 --> 02:47:33,110
it's not would you make the myth would
you give credit to the myth the

10254
02:47:33,110 --> 02:47:33,120
you give credit to the myth the
 

10255
02:47:33,120 --> 02:47:35,590
you give credit to the myth the
mythology as first contact

10256
02:47:35,590 --> 02:47:35,600
mythology as first contact
 

10257
02:47:35,600 --> 02:47:37,510
mythology as first contact
because i think yes i think it's the

10258
02:47:37,510 --> 02:47:37,520
because i think yes i think it's the
 

10259
02:47:37,520 --> 02:47:39,030
because i think yes i think it's the
rudimentary that we have some

10260
02:47:39,030 --> 02:47:39,040
rudimentary that we have some
 

10261
02:47:39,040 --> 02:47:40,710
rudimentary that we have some
understanding that there's a phenomena

10262
02:47:40,710 --> 02:47:40,720
understanding that there's a phenomena
 

10263
02:47:40,720 --> 02:47:42,230
understanding that there's a phenomena
that we have to understand and

10264
02:47:42,230 --> 02:47:42,240
that we have to understand and
 

10265
02:47:42,240 --> 02:47:43,510
that we have to understand and
regularize so i think right to

10266
02:47:43,510 --> 02:47:43,520
regularize so i think right to
 

10267
02:47:43,520 --> 02:47:45,590
regularize so i think right to
understand that there is weather yes you

10268
02:47:45,590 --> 02:47:45,600
understand that there is weather yes you
 

10269
02:47:45,600 --> 02:47:47,349
understand that there is weather yes you
have to construct the pathology around

10270
02:47:47,349 --> 02:47:47,359
have to construct the pathology around
 

10271
02:47:47,359 --> 02:47:48,389
have to construct the pathology around
that yes

10272
02:47:48,389 --> 02:47:48,399
that yes
 

10273
02:47:48,399 --> 02:47:50,630
that yes
it's something that's controllable

10274
02:47:50,630 --> 02:47:50,640
it's something that's controllable
 

10275
02:47:50,640 --> 02:47:52,630
it's something that's controllable
right yeah like this is i see mythology

10276
02:47:52,630 --> 02:47:52,640
right yeah like this is i see mythology
 

10277
02:47:52,640 --> 02:47:55,269
right yeah like this is i see mythology
basically as like baby knowledge

10278
02:47:55,269 --> 02:47:55,279
basically as like baby knowledge
 

10279
02:47:55,279 --> 02:47:56,150
basically as like baby knowledge
right

10280
02:47:56,150 --> 02:47:56,160
right
 

10281
02:47:56,160 --> 02:47:58,070
right
it could be that you know although

10282
02:47:58,070 --> 02:47:58,080
it could be that you know although
 

10283
02:47:58,080 --> 02:48:00,150
it could be that you know although
there's lots of there's lots of alien

10284
02:48:00,150 --> 02:48:00,160
there's lots of there's lots of alien
 

10285
02:48:00,160 --> 02:48:03,030
there's lots of there's lots of alien
sight up so-called alien sightings right

10286
02:48:03,030 --> 02:48:03,040
sight up so-called alien sightings right
 

10287
02:48:03,040 --> 02:48:04,070
sight up so-called alien sightings right
so there are a number of things you can

10288
02:48:04,070 --> 02:48:04,080
so there are a number of things you can
 

10289
02:48:04,080 --> 02:48:05,269
so there are a number of things you can
do you could just dismiss them and say

10290
02:48:05,269 --> 02:48:05,279
do you could just dismiss them and say
 

10291
02:48:05,279 --> 02:48:07,269
do you could just dismiss them and say
that's not true they're kind of made up

10292
02:48:07,269 --> 02:48:07,279
that's not true they're kind of made up
 

10293
02:48:07,279 --> 02:48:08,630
that's not true they're kind of made up
or you say well there's some there's

10294
02:48:08,630 --> 02:48:08,640
or you say well there's some there's
 

10295
02:48:08,640 --> 02:48:09,830
or you say well there's some there's
something interesting here right we keep

10296
02:48:09,830 --> 02:48:09,840
something interesting here right we keep
 

10297
02:48:09,840 --> 02:48:11,910
something interesting here right we keep
seeing the commonality right we see the

10298
02:48:11,910 --> 02:48:11,920
seeing the commonality right we see the
 

10299
02:48:11,920 --> 02:48:13,269
seeing the commonality right we see the
same phenomenon again and again and

10300
02:48:13,269 --> 02:48:13,279
same phenomenon again and again and
 

10301
02:48:13,279 --> 02:48:14,230
same phenomenon again and again and
again

10302
02:48:14,230 --> 02:48:14,240
again
 

10303
02:48:14,240 --> 02:48:15,830
again
also this is interesting about human

10304
02:48:15,830 --> 02:48:15,840
also this is interesting about human
 

10305
02:48:15,840 --> 02:48:17,190
also this is interesting about human
imagination

10306
02:48:17,190 --> 02:48:17,200
imagination
 

10307
02:48:17,200 --> 02:48:18,870
imagination
even if they are

10308
02:48:18,870 --> 02:48:18,880
even if they are
 

10309
02:48:18,880 --> 02:48:20,990
even if they are
let's not say made up but mis

10310
02:48:20,990 --> 02:48:21,000
let's not say made up but mis
 

10311
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,590
let's not say made up but mis
misappropriated kind of other inputs

10312
02:48:23,590 --> 02:48:23,600
misappropriated kind of other inputs
 

10313
02:48:23,600 --> 02:48:25,670
misappropriated kind of other inputs
the fact that human consciousness is

10314
02:48:25,670 --> 02:48:25,680
the fact that human consciousness is
 

10315
02:48:25,680 --> 02:48:29,110
the fact that human consciousness is
capable of imagining contact with aliens

10316
02:48:29,110 --> 02:48:29,120
capable of imagining contact with aliens
 

10317
02:48:29,120 --> 02:48:30,550
capable of imagining contact with aliens
does that not tell us about something

10318
02:48:30,550 --> 02:48:30,560
does that not tell us about something
 

10319
02:48:30,560 --> 02:48:32,070
does that not tell us about something
about where we are in our position in

10320
02:48:32,070 --> 02:48:32,080
about where we are in our position in
 

10321
02:48:32,080 --> 02:48:34,150
about where we are in our position in
our culture and our technology it tells

10322
02:48:34,150 --> 02:48:34,160
our culture and our technology it tells
 

10323
02:48:34,160 --> 02:48:36,150
our culture and our technology it tells
us where in time we are could it be that

10324
02:48:36,150 --> 02:48:36,160
us where in time we are could it be that
 

10325
02:48:36,160 --> 02:48:38,550
us where in time we are could it be that
we're making contact with let's say that

10326
02:48:38,550 --> 02:48:38,560
we're making contact with let's say that
 

10327
02:48:38,560 --> 02:48:40,630
we're making contact with let's say that
so let's say let's take the most

10328
02:48:40,630 --> 02:48:40,640
so let's say let's take the most
 

10329
02:48:40,640 --> 02:48:42,070
so let's say let's take the most
miserable version there are no aliens in

10330
02:48:42,070 --> 02:48:42,080
miserable version there are no aliens in
 

10331
02:48:42,080 --> 02:48:44,550
miserable version there are no aliens in
the universe life is only on earth

10332
02:48:44,550 --> 02:48:44,560
the universe life is only on earth
 

10333
02:48:44,560 --> 02:48:46,230
the universe life is only on earth
that then the interpretation of that is

10334
02:48:46,230 --> 02:48:46,240
that then the interpretation of that is
 

10335
02:48:46,240 --> 02:48:47,990
that then the interpretation of that is
we're desperate to kind of understand

10336
02:48:47,990 --> 02:48:48,000
we're desperate to kind of understand
 

10337
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:49,670
we're desperate to kind of understand
why we're the only life in the universe

10338
02:48:49,670 --> 02:48:49,680
why we're the only life in the universe
 

10339
02:48:49,680 --> 02:48:51,429
why we're the only life in the universe
right the other one is the other most

10340
02:48:51,429 --> 02:48:51,439
right the other one is the other most
 

10341
02:48:51,439 --> 02:48:52,870
right the other one is the other most
extreme is that aliens are visiting all

10342
02:48:52,870 --> 02:48:52,880
extreme is that aliens are visiting all
 

10343
02:48:52,880 --> 02:48:54,309
extreme is that aliens are visiting all
the time and we just you know we're just

10344
02:48:54,309 --> 02:48:54,319
the time and we just you know we're just
 

10345
02:48:54,319 --> 02:48:57,030
the time and we just you know we're just
not able to capture them coherently or

10346
02:48:57,030 --> 02:48:57,040
not able to capture them coherently or
 

10347
02:48:57,040 --> 02:48:58,469
not able to capture them coherently or
there's a big conspiracy and you know

10348
02:48:58,469 --> 02:48:58,479
there's a big conspiracy and you know
 

10349
02:48:58,479 --> 02:49:00,950
there's a big conspiracy and you know
there's an area 51 and there are lizards

10350
02:49:00,950 --> 02:49:00,960
there's an area 51 and there are lizards
 

10351
02:49:00,960 --> 02:49:02,150
there's an area 51 and there are lizards
everywhere and

10352
02:49:02,150 --> 02:49:02,160
everywhere and
 

10353
02:49:02,160 --> 02:49:03,269
everywhere and
there's that

10354
02:49:03,269 --> 02:49:03,279
there's that
 

10355
02:49:03,279 --> 02:49:05,750
there's that
um or i i'm i kind of in favor of the

10356
02:49:05,750 --> 02:49:05,760
um or i i'm i kind of in favor of the
 

10357
02:49:05,760 --> 02:49:07,830
um or i i'm i kind of in favor of the
idea that maybe humanity is waking up to

10358
02:49:07,830 --> 02:49:07,840
idea that maybe humanity is waking up to
 

10359
02:49:07,840 --> 02:49:09,190
idea that maybe humanity is waking up to
the idea that we aren't alone in the

10360
02:49:09,190 --> 02:49:09,200
the idea that we aren't alone in the
 

10361
02:49:09,200 --> 02:49:10,469
the idea that we aren't alone in the
universe and we're just running the

10362
02:49:10,469 --> 02:49:10,479
universe and we're just running the
 

10363
02:49:10,479 --> 02:49:11,990
universe and we're just running the
simulation

10364
02:49:11,990 --> 02:49:12,000
simulation
 

10365
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,469
simulation
and we're seeing some evidence you know

10366
02:49:14,469 --> 02:49:14,479
and we're seeing some evidence you know
 

10367
02:49:14,479 --> 02:49:16,870
and we're seeing some evidence you know
we don't we don't know what life is yet

10368
02:49:16,870 --> 02:49:16,880
we don't we don't know what life is yet
 

10369
02:49:16,880 --> 02:49:18,710
we don't we don't know what life is yet
we are we do have some anomalies out

10370
02:49:18,710 --> 02:49:18,720
we are we do have some anomalies out
 

10371
02:49:18,720 --> 02:49:19,590
we are we do have some anomalies out
there

10372
02:49:19,590 --> 02:49:19,600
there
 

10373
02:49:19,600 --> 02:49:21,510
there
we can't explain everything

10374
02:49:21,510 --> 02:49:21,520
we can't explain everything
 

10375
02:49:21,520 --> 02:49:22,630
we can't explain everything
um

10376
02:49:22,630 --> 02:49:22,640
um
 

10377
02:49:22,640 --> 02:49:24,870
um
and over time

10378
02:49:24,870 --> 02:49:24,880
and over time
 

10379
02:49:24,880 --> 02:49:28,469
and over time
um you know we will start to unpack that

10380
02:49:28,469 --> 02:49:28,479
um you know we will start to unpack that
 

10381
02:49:28,479 --> 02:49:30,710
um you know we will start to unpack that
one very plausible thing we might do

10382
02:49:30,710 --> 02:49:30,720
one very plausible thing we might do
 

10383
02:49:30,720 --> 02:49:32,469
one very plausible thing we might do
which might be boring for the average

10384
02:49:32,469 --> 02:49:32,479
which might be boring for the average
 

10385
02:49:32,479 --> 02:49:33,510
which might be boring for the average
alien

10386
02:49:33,510 --> 02:49:33,520
alien
 

10387
02:49:33,520 --> 02:49:35,190
alien
um

10388
02:49:35,190 --> 02:49:35,200
um
 

10389
02:49:35,200 --> 02:49:37,429
um
observer or believes that aliens are as

10390
02:49:37,429 --> 02:49:37,439
observer or believes that aliens are as
 

10391
02:49:37,439 --> 02:49:39,510
observer or believes that aliens are as
in intelligent aliens are visiting earth

10392
02:49:39,510 --> 02:49:39,520
in intelligent aliens are visiting earth
 

10393
02:49:39,520 --> 02:49:40,790
in intelligent aliens are visiting earth
it could be that we might go to the

10394
02:49:40,790 --> 02:49:40,800
it could be that we might go to the
 

10395
02:49:40,800 --> 02:49:42,550
it could be that we might go to the
outer solar system

10396
02:49:42,550 --> 02:49:42,560
outer solar system
 

10397
02:49:42,560 --> 02:49:44,710
outer solar system

completely new chemistry bring these

10400
02:49:47,030 --> 02:49:47,040
completely new chemistry bring these
 

10401
02:49:47,040 --> 02:49:48,950
completely new chemistry bring these
cells back to earth where you could say

10402
02:49:48,950 --> 02:49:48,960
cells back to earth where you could say
 

10403
02:49:48,960 --> 02:49:52,150
cells back to earth where you could say
in my hand on earth here's rna dna and

10404
02:49:52,150 --> 02:49:52,160
in my hand on earth here's rna dna and
 

10405
02:49:52,160 --> 02:49:54,870
in my hand on earth here's rna dna and
proteins and look cells self-replicate

from titan we've got this new set of

10408
02:49:56,870 --> 02:49:56,880
from titan we've got this new set of
 

10409
02:49:56,880 --> 02:49:58,870
from titan we've got this new set of
molecules new set of cells

molecules new set of cells
 

10411
02:49:58,880 --> 02:50:01,349
molecules new set of cells
and we feed it stuff and it grows

10412
02:50:01,349 --> 02:50:01,359
and we feed it stuff and it grows
 

10413
02:50:01,359 --> 02:50:02,550
and we feed it stuff and it grows
that for me

10414
02:50:02,550 --> 02:50:02,560
that for me
 

10415
02:50:02,560 --> 02:50:05,110
that for me
if we were able to do that which

10416
02:50:05,110 --> 02:50:05,120
if we were able to do that which
 

10417
02:50:05,120 --> 02:50:07,910
if we were able to do that which
would be like the the most that would be

10418
02:50:07,910 --> 02:50:07,920
would be like the the most that would be
 

10419
02:50:07,920 --> 02:50:10,150
would be like the the most that would be
my ufo sighting that's a good test so

10420
02:50:10,150 --> 02:50:10,160
my ufo sighting that's a good test so
 

10421
02:50:10,160 --> 02:50:14,469
my ufo sighting that's a good test so
you feed it and it grows yeah

10422
02:50:14,469 --> 02:50:14,479
you feed it and it grows yeah
 

10423
02:50:14,479 --> 02:50:16,950
you feed it and it grows yeah
we've made so not until you know how to

10424
02:50:16,950 --> 02:50:16,960
we've made so not until you know how to
 

10425
02:50:16,960 --> 02:50:18,900
we've made so not until you know how to
feed the thing

10426
02:50:18,900 --> 02:50:18,910
feed the thing
 

10427
02:50:18,910 --> 02:50:21,429

02:50:23,269 --> 02:50:23,279
it grows somehow we can make a comic

02:50:23,279 --> 02:50:24,550
it grows somehow we can make a comic
book you know the tiger that came for

02:50:27,840 --> 02:50:29,670
tea the alien that came for tea
what would you say is

10436
02:50:29,670 --> 02:50:29,680
what would you say is
 

10437
02:50:29,680 --> 02:50:31,190
what would you say is
between the two of you is the biggest

10438
02:50:31,190 --> 02:50:31,200
between the two of you is the biggest
 

10439
02:50:31,200 --> 02:50:34,389
between the two of you is the biggest
disagreement about aliens alien life out

10440
02:50:34,389 --> 02:50:34,399
disagreement about aliens alien life out
 

10441
02:50:34,399 --> 02:50:35,670
disagreement about aliens alien life out
there

10442
02:50:35,670 --> 02:50:35,680
there
 

10443
02:50:35,680 --> 02:50:36,950
there
is it

10444
02:50:36,950 --> 02:50:36,960
is it
 

10445
02:50:36,960 --> 02:50:38,790
is it
from the basic framework of thinking

10446
02:50:38,790 --> 02:50:38,800
from the basic framework of thinking
 

10447
02:50:38,800 --> 02:50:41,349
from the basic framework of thinking
about what is life to maybe what aliens

10448
02:50:41,349 --> 02:50:41,359
about what is life to maybe what aliens
 

10449
02:50:41,359 --> 02:50:43,990
about what is life to maybe what aliens
look like to alien civilizations to a

10450
02:50:43,990 --> 02:50:44,000
look like to alien civilizations to a
 

10451
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:45,750
look like to alien civilizations to a
ufo sightings

10452
02:50:45,750 --> 02:50:45,760
ufo sightings
 

10453
02:50:45,760 --> 02:50:47,190
ufo sightings
what would you think

10454
02:50:47,190 --> 02:50:47,200
what would you think
 

10455
02:50:47,200 --> 02:50:49,030
what would you think
so i would say the biggest one is that

10456
02:50:49,030 --> 02:50:49,040
so i would say the biggest one is that
 

10457
02:50:49,040 --> 02:50:52,469
so i would say the biggest one is that
um the emergence of life does not have

10458
02:50:52,469 --> 02:50:52,479
um the emergence of life does not have
 

10459
02:50:52,479 --> 02:50:53,670
um the emergence of life does not have
to be

10460
02:50:53,670 --> 02:50:53,680
to be
 

10461
02:50:53,680 --> 02:50:54,870
to be
um

10462
02:50:54,870 --> 02:50:54,880
um
 

10463
02:50:54,880 --> 02:50:56,870
um
that can it can't just happen once on

10464
02:50:56,870 --> 02:50:56,880
that can it can't just happen once on
 

10465
02:50:56,880 --> 02:50:58,790
that can it can't just happen once on
the planet that it could be two or more

10466
02:50:58,790 --> 02:50:58,800
the planet that it could be two or more
 

10467
02:50:58,800 --> 02:51:01,190
the planet that it could be two or more
life forms present on the planet at once

10468
02:51:01,190 --> 02:51:01,200
life forms present on the planet at once
 

10469
02:51:01,200 --> 02:51:02,389
life forms present on the planet at once
and i think sarah doesn't agree with

10470
02:51:02,389 --> 02:51:02,399
and i think sarah doesn't agree with
 

10471
02:51:02,399 --> 02:51:03,349
and i think sarah doesn't agree with
that

10472
02:51:03,349 --> 02:51:03,359
that
 

10473
02:51:03,359 --> 02:51:04,950
that
i think that's like

10474
02:51:04,950 --> 02:51:04,960
i think that's like
 

10475
02:51:04,960 --> 02:51:07,510
i think that's like
logically inconsistent

10476
02:51:07,510 --> 02:51:07,520
logically inconsistent
 

10477
02:51:07,520 --> 02:51:09,349
logically inconsistent
that's really polite you're saying it's

10478
02:51:09,349 --> 02:51:09,359
that's really polite you're saying it's
 

10479
02:51:09,359 --> 02:51:11,190
that's really polite you're saying it's
nonsense but because you think that yeah

10480
02:51:11,190 --> 02:51:11,200
nonsense but because you think that yeah
 

10481
02:51:11,200 --> 02:51:13,110
nonsense but because you think that yeah
how likely is that so the idea that what

10482
02:51:13,110 --> 02:51:13,120
how likely is that so the idea that what
 

10483
02:51:13,120 --> 02:51:15,990
how likely is that so the idea that what
is what does it look like let's imagine

10484
02:51:15,990 --> 02:51:16,000
is what does it look like let's imagine
 

10485
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,790
is what does it look like let's imagine
uh two alien civilizations coexisting on

10486
02:51:18,790 --> 02:51:18,800
uh two alien civilizations coexisting on
 

10487
02:51:18,800 --> 02:51:21,110
uh two alien civilizations coexisting on
a planet what's that look like exactly

10488
02:51:21,110 --> 02:51:21,120
a planet what's that look like exactly
 

10489
02:51:21,120 --> 02:51:23,510
a planet what's that look like exactly
so i would say um

10490
02:51:23,510 --> 02:51:23,520
so i would say um
 

10491
02:51:23,520 --> 02:51:24,870
so i would say um
i think i've got to get around your

10492
02:51:24,870 --> 02:51:24,880
i think i've got to get around your
 

10493
02:51:24,880 --> 02:51:27,510
i think i've got to get around your
argument okay yeah let's say that say

10494
02:51:27,510 --> 02:51:27,520
argument okay yeah let's say that say
 

10495
02:51:27,520 --> 02:51:29,269
argument okay yeah let's say that say
that on this planet there's just like

10496
02:51:29,269 --> 02:51:29,279
that on this planet there's just like
 

10497
02:51:29,279 --> 02:51:31,670
that on this planet there's just like
there's lots of available chemistry

10498
02:51:31,670 --> 02:51:31,680
there's lots of available chemistry
 

10499
02:51:31,680 --> 02:51:34,070
there's lots of available chemistry
and one life form gets some

10500
02:51:34,070 --> 02:51:34,080
and one life form gets some
 

10501
02:51:34,080 --> 02:51:36,070
and one life form gets some
emerges based on carbon and interacts

10502
02:51:36,070 --> 02:51:36,080
emerges based on carbon and interacts
 

10503
02:51:36,080 --> 02:51:37,830
emerges based on carbon and interacts
and there's a there's an ecosystem based

10504
02:51:37,830 --> 02:51:37,840
and there's a there's an ecosystem based
 

10505
02:51:37,840 --> 02:51:40,630
and there's a there's an ecosystem based
on carbon and there's an orthogonal

10506
02:51:40,630 --> 02:51:40,640
on carbon and there's an orthogonal
 

10507
02:51:40,640 --> 02:51:41,750
on carbon and there's an orthogonal
um

10508
02:51:41,750 --> 02:51:41,760
um
 

10509
02:51:41,760 --> 02:51:43,510
um
and so it's planetary phenomena which is

10510
02:51:43,510 --> 02:51:43,520
and so it's planetary phenomena which is
 

10511
02:51:43,520 --> 02:51:45,110
and so it's planetary phenomena which is
what you i think right

10512
02:51:45,110 --> 02:51:45,120
what you i think right
 

10513
02:51:45,120 --> 02:51:46,469
what you i think right
but there's also one that goes on

10514
02:51:46,469 --> 02:51:46,479
but there's also one that goes on
 

10515
02:51:46,479 --> 02:51:47,510
but there's also one that goes on
silicon

10516
02:51:47,510 --> 02:51:47,520
silicon
 

10517
02:51:47,520 --> 02:51:49,750
silicon
and and because there's enough energy

10518
02:51:49,750 --> 02:51:49,760
and and because there's enough energy
 

10519
02:51:49,760 --> 02:51:50,950
and and because there's enough energy
and there's enough

10520
02:51:50,950 --> 02:51:50,960
and there's enough
 

10521
02:51:50,960 --> 02:51:51,990
and there's enough
stuff

10522
02:51:51,990 --> 02:51:52,000
stuff
 

10523
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:53,750
stuff
that these light forms might not

10524
02:51:53,750 --> 02:51:53,760
that these light forms might not
 

10525
02:51:53,760 --> 02:51:56,510
that these light forms might not
actually necessarily compete um

10526
02:51:56,510 --> 02:51:56,520
actually necessarily compete um
 

10527
02:51:56,520 --> 02:51:58,469
actually necessarily compete um
evolutionarily yeah but they would have

10528
02:51:58,469 --> 02:51:58,479
evolutionarily yeah but they would have
 

10529
02:51:58,479 --> 02:52:00,070
evolutionarily yeah but they would have
to not interact at all because they're

10530
02:52:00,070 --> 02:52:00,080
to not interact at all because they're
 

10531
02:52:00,080 --> 02:52:01,830
to not interact at all because they're
going to be co-constructing each other's

10532
02:52:01,830 --> 02:52:01,840
going to be co-constructing each other's
 

10533
02:52:01,840 --> 02:52:03,110
going to be co-constructing each other's
causal chains i think that's where you

10534
02:52:03,110 --> 02:52:03,120
causal chains i think that's where you
 

10535
02:52:03,120 --> 02:52:05,190
causal chains i think that's where you
just got me yeah so there's no

10536
02:52:05,190 --> 02:52:05,200
just got me yeah so there's no
 

10537
02:52:05,200 --> 02:52:07,910
just got me yeah so there's no
so there's no overlap

10538
02:52:07,910 --> 02:52:07,920
so there's no overlap
 

10539
02:52:07,920 --> 02:52:09,269
so there's no overlap
in terms of their causal change they're

10540
02:52:09,269 --> 02:52:09,279
in terms of their causal change they're
 

10541
02:52:09,279 --> 02:52:10,950
in terms of their causal change they're
very limited yeah so i think the only

10542
02:52:10,950 --> 02:52:10,960
very limited yeah so i think the only
 

10543
02:52:10,960 --> 02:52:12,309
very limited yeah so i think the only
way i can get away with that is to say

10544
02:52:12,309 --> 02:52:12,319
way i can get away with that is to say
 

10545
02:52:12,319 --> 02:52:13,990
way i can get away with that is to say
right life can emerge on a planet

10546
02:52:13,990 --> 02:52:14,000
right life can emerge on a planet
 

10547
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:15,269
right life can emerge on a planet
underneath

10548
02:52:15,269 --> 02:52:15,279
underneath
 

10549
02:52:15,279 --> 02:52:17,830
underneath
and uh okay lizard people under the

10550
02:52:17,830 --> 02:52:17,840
and uh okay lizard people under the
 

10551
02:52:17,840 --> 02:52:19,670
and uh okay lizard people under the
quest of the year i think i think i

10552
02:52:19,670 --> 02:52:19,680
quest of the year i think i think i
 

10553
02:52:19,680 --> 02:52:22,870
quest of the year i think i think i
think let's go d i i i think

10554
02:52:22,870 --> 02:52:22,880
think let's go d i i i think
 

10555
02:52:22,880 --> 02:52:24,309
think let's go d i i i think
that but look as you can see we disagree

10556
02:52:24,309 --> 02:52:24,319
that but look as you can see we disagree
 

10557
02:52:24,319 --> 02:52:26,230
that but look as you can see we disagree
so and i think sarah actually has

10558
02:52:26,230 --> 02:52:26,240
so and i think sarah actually has
 

10559
02:52:26,240 --> 02:52:28,469
so and i think sarah actually has
convinced me because of that that life

10560
02:52:28,469 --> 02:52:28,479
convinced me because of that that life
 

10561
02:52:28,479 --> 02:52:30,469
convinced me because of that that life
is a planetary for not the emotional

10562
02:52:30,469 --> 02:52:30,479
is a planetary for not the emotional
 

10563
02:52:30,479 --> 02:52:33,030
is a planetary for not the emotional
slice of planetary phenomena and and

10564
02:52:33,030 --> 02:52:33,040
slice of planetary phenomena and and
 

10565
02:52:33,040 --> 02:52:35,510
slice of planetary phenomena and and
actually um because of the way evolution

10566
02:52:35,510 --> 02:52:35,520
actually um because of the way evolution
 

10567
02:52:35,520 --> 02:52:37,590
actually um because of the way evolution
selection works then nothing occurs in

10568
02:52:37,590 --> 02:52:37,600
selection works then nothing occurs in
 

10569
02:52:37,600 --> 02:52:39,349
selection works then nothing occurs in
isolation the causal chains interact so

10570
02:52:39,349 --> 02:52:39,359
isolation the causal chains interact so
 

10571
02:52:39,359 --> 02:52:41,190
isolation the causal chains interact so
there is a common there's a consensus

10572
02:52:41,190 --> 02:52:41,200
there is a common there's a consensus
 

10573
02:52:41,200 --> 02:52:42,630
there is a common there's a consensus
model for life on the earth but you

10574
02:52:42,630 --> 02:52:42,640
model for life on the earth but you
 

10575
02:52:42,640 --> 02:52:45,750
model for life on the earth but you
don't think you can place aliens

10576
02:52:45,750 --> 02:52:45,760
don't think you can place aliens
 

10577
02:52:45,760 --> 02:52:48,870
don't think you can place aliens
from elsewhere onto the can't you just

10578
02:52:48,870 --> 02:52:48,880
from elsewhere onto the can't you just
 

10579
02:52:48,880 --> 02:52:51,429
from elsewhere onto the can't you just
uh place multiple alien civilizations on

10580
02:52:51,429 --> 02:52:51,439
uh place multiple alien civilizations on
 

10581
02:52:51,439 --> 02:52:53,910
uh place multiple alien civilizations on
one planet right but i think

10582
02:52:53,910 --> 02:52:53,920
one planet right but i think
 

10583
02:52:53,920 --> 02:52:55,590
one planet right but i think
so you can take

10584
02:52:55,590 --> 02:52:55,600
so you can take
 

10585
02:52:55,600 --> 02:52:57,030
so you can take
two original life events that were

10586
02:52:57,030 --> 02:52:57,040
two original life events that were
 

10587
02:52:57,040 --> 02:52:59,750
two original life events that were
independent and co-mingle them but

10588
02:52:59,750 --> 02:52:59,760
independent and co-mingle them but
 

10589
02:52:59,760 --> 02:53:03,349
independent and co-mingle them but
i don't think when you're talking about

10590
02:53:03,349 --> 02:53:03,359
i don't think when you're talking about
 

10591
02:53:03,359 --> 02:53:04,550
i don't think when you're talking about
when you when you look at the

10592
02:53:04,550 --> 02:53:04,560
when you when you look at the
 

10593
02:53:04,560 --> 02:53:07,910
when you when you look at the
interaction of that structure it's it

10594
02:53:07,910 --> 02:53:07,920
interaction of that structure it's it
 

10595
02:53:07,920 --> 02:53:09,429
interaction of that structure it's it
it's like the same idea as like an

10596
02:53:09,429 --> 02:53:09,439
it's like the same idea as like an
 

10597
02:53:09,439 --> 02:53:11,110
it's like the same idea as like an
experiment being an example of life

10598
02:53:11,110 --> 02:53:11,120
experiment being an example of life
 

10599
02:53:11,120 --> 02:53:12,469
experiment being an example of life
right that's a really abstract and

10600
02:53:12,469 --> 02:53:12,479
right that's a really abstract and
 

10601
02:53:12,479 --> 02:53:14,230
right that's a really abstract and
subtle concept and i guess what i'm

10602
02:53:14,230 --> 02:53:14,240
subtle concept and i guess what i'm
 

10603
02:53:14,240 --> 02:53:15,510
subtle concept and i guess what i'm
saying is

10604
02:53:15,510 --> 02:53:15,520
saying is
 

10605
02:53:15,520 --> 02:53:17,750
saying is
life is information propagating through

10606
02:53:17,750 --> 02:53:17,760
life is information propagating through
 

10607
02:53:17,760 --> 02:53:19,590
life is information propagating through
matter so once you start having things

10608
02:53:19,590 --> 02:53:19,600
matter so once you start having things
 

10609
02:53:19,600 --> 02:53:21,190
matter so once you start having things
interacting

10610
02:53:21,190 --> 02:53:21,200
interacting
 

10611
02:53:21,200 --> 02:53:23,590
interacting
they in some sense commingle and they

10612
02:53:23,590 --> 02:53:23,600
they in some sense commingle and they
 

10613
02:53:23,600 --> 02:53:25,590
they in some sense commingle and they
become part of the same

10614
02:53:25,590 --> 02:53:25,600
become part of the same
 

10615
02:53:25,600 --> 02:53:26,950
become part of the same
chain

10616
02:53:26,950 --> 02:53:26,960
chain
 

10617
02:53:26,960 --> 02:53:27,670
chain
so

10618
02:53:27,670 --> 02:53:27,680
so
 

10619
02:53:27,680 --> 02:53:29,830
so
the commingling starts quickly yeah

10620
02:53:29,830 --> 02:53:29,840
the commingling starts quickly yeah
 

10621
02:53:29,840 --> 02:53:32,309
the commingling starts quickly yeah
proceeds we proceed to co-mingle quickly

10622
02:53:32,309 --> 02:53:32,319
proceeds we proceed to co-mingle quickly
 

10623
02:53:32,319 --> 02:53:34,950
proceeds we proceed to co-mingle quickly
right right so you you could say so the

10624
02:53:34,950 --> 02:53:34,960
right right so you you could say so the
 

10625
02:53:34,960 --> 02:53:36,469
right right so you you could say so the
question is then

10626
02:53:36,469 --> 02:53:36,479
question is then
 

10627
02:53:36,479 --> 02:53:37,910
question is then
the more interesting question is are

10628
02:53:37,910 --> 02:53:37,920
the more interesting question is are
 

10629
02:53:37,920 --> 02:53:39,990
the more interesting question is are
there two distinct origins events and i

10630
02:53:39,990 --> 02:53:40,000
there two distinct origins events and i
 

10631
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:41,910
there two distinct origins events and i
still think that there's reasons that on

10632
02:53:41,910 --> 02:53:41,920
still think that there's reasons that on
 

10633
02:53:41,920 --> 02:53:43,429
still think that there's reasons that on
a single planet you would have one

10634
02:53:43,429 --> 02:53:43,439
a single planet you would have one
 

10635
02:53:43,439 --> 02:53:45,910
a single planet you would have one
origins event because of the time scales

10636
02:53:45,910 --> 02:53:45,920
origins event because of the time scales
 

10637
02:53:45,920 --> 02:53:47,510
origins event because of the time scales
of cycling

10638
02:53:47,510 --> 02:53:47,520
of cycling
 

10639
02:53:47,520 --> 02:53:50,070
of cycling
of geochemistry on a planet and also the

10640
02:53:50,070 --> 02:53:50,080
of geochemistry on a planet and also the
 

10641
02:53:50,080 --> 02:53:51,590
of geochemistry on a planet and also the
fact that i don't think that the origin

10642
02:53:51,590 --> 02:53:51,600
fact that i don't think that the origin
 

10643
02:53:51,600 --> 02:53:53,510
fact that i don't think that the origin
of life happens in a pool and like

10644
02:53:53,510 --> 02:53:53,520
of life happens in a pool and like
 

10645
02:53:53,520 --> 02:53:55,429
of life happens in a pool and like
radiates outward through evolutionary

10646
02:53:55,429 --> 02:53:55,439
radiates outward through evolutionary
 

10647
02:53:55,439 --> 02:53:57,110
radiates outward through evolutionary
processes i think it's a multi-scale

10648
02:53:57,110 --> 02:53:57,120
processes i think it's a multi-scale
 

10649
02:53:57,120 --> 02:53:58,630
processes i think it's a multi-scale
phenomena it happens at the level of

10650
02:53:58,630 --> 02:53:58,640
phenomena it happens at the level of
 

10651
02:53:58,640 --> 02:54:00,389
phenomena it happens at the level of
individual molecules interacting

10652
02:54:00,389 --> 02:54:00,399
individual molecules interacting
 

10653
02:54:00,399 --> 02:54:02,150
individual molecules interacting
collections of molecules interacting and

10654
02:54:02,150 --> 02:54:02,160
collections of molecules interacting and
 

10655
02:54:02,160 --> 02:54:04,870
collections of molecules interacting and
entire planetary scale cycles so life as

10656
02:54:04,870 --> 02:54:04,880
entire planetary scale cycles so life as
 

10657
02:54:04,880 --> 02:54:07,830
entire planetary scale cycles so life as
we know it has always been multi-scale

10658
02:54:07,830 --> 02:54:07,840
we know it has always been multi-scale
 

10659
02:54:07,840 --> 02:54:10,309
we know it has always been multi-scale
and there's i'm brilliant examples of

10660
02:54:10,309 --> 02:54:10,319
and there's i'm brilliant examples of
 

10661
02:54:10,319 --> 02:54:12,309
and there's i'm brilliant examples of
individual mutations at the genome level

10662
02:54:12,309 --> 02:54:12,319
individual mutations at the genome level
 

10663
02:54:12,319 --> 02:54:14,790
individual mutations at the genome level
changing global climate right so there's

10664
02:54:14,790 --> 02:54:14,800
changing global climate right so there's
 

10665
02:54:14,800 --> 02:54:16,870
changing global climate right so there's
a tight coupling between things that

10666
02:54:16,870 --> 02:54:16,880
a tight coupling between things that
 

10667
02:54:16,880 --> 02:54:17,750
a tight coupling between things that
happen

10668
02:54:17,750 --> 02:54:17,760
happen
 

10669
02:54:17,760 --> 02:54:19,990
happen
at you know the largest scale our

10670
02:54:19,990 --> 02:54:20,000
at you know the largest scale our
 

10671
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:22,950
at you know the largest scale our
planetary scale and the smallest scale

10672
02:54:22,950 --> 02:54:22,960
planetary scale and the smallest scale
 

10673
02:54:22,960 --> 02:54:24,790
planetary scale and the smallest scale
that life mediates but it still might be

10674
02:54:24,790 --> 02:54:24,800
that life mediates but it still might be
 

10675
02:54:24,800 --> 02:54:26,870
that life mediates but it still might be
difficult within something you would

10676
02:54:26,870 --> 02:54:26,880
difficult within something you would
 

10677
02:54:26,880 --> 02:54:28,630
difficult within something you would
call as a single civil alien

10678
02:54:28,630 --> 02:54:28,640
call as a single civil alien
 

10679
02:54:28,640 --> 02:54:30,870
call as a single civil alien
civilization you know different their

10680
02:54:30,870 --> 02:54:30,880
civilization you know different their
 

10681
02:54:30,880 --> 02:54:32,630
civilization you know different their
species and stuff but i think what yeah

10682
02:54:32,630 --> 02:54:32,640
species and stuff but i think what yeah
 

10683
02:54:32,640 --> 02:54:34,150
species and stuff but i think what yeah
they might not be able to communicate

10684
02:54:34,150 --> 02:54:34,160
they might not be able to communicate
 

10685
02:54:34,160 --> 02:54:36,230
they might not be able to communicate
but you're asking about life not species

10686
02:54:36,230 --> 02:54:36,240
but you're asking about life not species
 

10687
02:54:36,240 --> 02:54:39,990
but you're asking about life not species
right so what's the difference between

10688
02:54:39,990 --> 02:54:40,000

 

10689
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:40,870

one

10690
02:54:40,870 --> 02:54:40,880
one
 

10691
02:54:40,880 --> 02:54:43,510
one
living civilization this this is almost

10692
02:54:43,510 --> 02:54:43,520
living civilization this this is almost
 

10693
02:54:43,520 --> 02:54:45,910
living civilization this this is almost
like a category question yeah

10694
02:54:45,910 --> 02:54:45,920
like a category question yeah
 

10695
02:54:45,920 --> 02:54:48,389
like a category question yeah
versus species because it can be very

10696
02:54:48,389 --> 02:54:48,399
versus species because it can be very
 

10697
02:54:48,399 --> 02:54:50,710
versus species because it can be very
different like evolution because there's

10698
02:54:50,710 --> 02:54:50,720
different like evolution because there's
 

10699
02:54:50,720 --> 02:54:53,110
different like evolution because there's
like island like literally islands that

10700
02:54:53,110 --> 02:54:53,120
like island like literally islands that
 

10701
02:54:53,120 --> 02:54:54,469
like island like literally islands that
you can involve different kinds of

10702
02:54:54,469 --> 02:54:54,479
you can involve different kinds of
 

10703
02:54:54,479 --> 02:54:56,950
you can involve different kinds of
turtles and stuff and they can

10704
02:54:56,950 --> 02:54:56,960
turtles and stuff and they can
 

10705
02:54:56,960 --> 02:54:59,269
turtles and stuff and they can
so i guess what i'm saying is weird if

10706
02:54:59,269 --> 02:54:59,279
so i guess what i'm saying is weird if
 

10707
02:54:59,279 --> 02:55:01,269
so i guess what i'm saying is weird if
you look at the structure of two

10708
02:55:01,269 --> 02:55:01,279
you look at the structure of two
 

10709
02:55:01,279 --> 02:55:02,630
you look at the structure of two
interacting

10710
02:55:02,630 --> 02:55:02,640
interacting
 

10711
02:55:02,640 --> 02:55:05,269
interacting
living things populations

10712
02:55:05,269 --> 02:55:05,279
living things populations
 

10713
02:55:05,279 --> 02:55:07,910
living things populations
and you look in their past and they have

10714
02:55:07,910 --> 02:55:07,920
and you look in their past and they have
 

10715
02:55:07,920 --> 02:55:09,670
and you look in their past and they have
independent origins for their causal

10716
02:55:09,670 --> 02:55:09,680
independent origins for their causal
 

10717
02:55:09,680 --> 02:55:11,910
independent origins for their causal
chain then you would say one was alien

10718
02:55:11,910 --> 02:55:11,920
chain then you would say one was alien
 

10719
02:55:11,920 --> 02:55:13,670
chain then you would say one was alien
you know they have different independent

10720
02:55:13,670 --> 02:55:13,680
you know they have different independent
 

10721
02:55:13,680 --> 02:55:15,429
you know they have different independent
origins events but if you look at their

10722
02:55:15,429 --> 02:55:15,439
origins events but if you look at their
 

10723
02:55:15,439 --> 02:55:17,030
origins events but if you look at their
future by virtue of the fact they're

10724
02:55:17,030 --> 02:55:17,040
future by virtue of the fact they're
 

10725
02:55:17,040 --> 02:55:18,950
future by virtue of the fact they're
interacting their causal chains have

10726
02:55:18,950 --> 02:55:18,960
interacting their causal chains have
 

10727
02:55:18,960 --> 02:55:21,110
interacting their causal chains have
become co-mingled so that and then in

10728
02:55:21,110 --> 02:55:21,120
become co-mingled so that and then in
 

10729
02:55:21,120 --> 02:55:22,950
become co-mingled so that and then in
the future they they

10730
02:55:22,950 --> 02:55:22,960
the future they they
 

10731
02:55:22,960 --> 02:55:24,790
the future they they
they are not independent

10732
02:55:24,790 --> 02:55:24,800
they are not independent
 

10733
02:55:24,800 --> 02:55:27,190
they are not independent
um right right so that's why you would

10734
02:55:27,190 --> 02:55:27,200
um right right so that's why you would
 

10735
02:55:27,200 --> 02:55:29,110
um right right so that's why you would
even define them as aliens so the

10736
02:55:29,110 --> 02:55:29,120
even define them as aliens so the
 

10737
02:55:29,120 --> 02:55:30,790
even define them as aliens so the
structure across time

10738
02:55:30,790 --> 02:55:30,800
structure across time
 

10739
02:55:30,800 --> 02:55:32,870
structure across time
is two examples of life become one

10740
02:55:32,870 --> 02:55:32,880
is two examples of life become one
 

10741
02:55:32,880 --> 02:55:34,230
is two examples of life become one
example of life because life is the

10742
02:55:34,230 --> 02:55:34,240
example of life because life is the
 

10743
02:55:34,240 --> 02:55:37,030
example of life because life is the
entire structure across time right but

10744
02:55:37,030 --> 02:55:37,040
entire structure across time right but
 

10745
02:55:37,040 --> 02:55:39,030
entire structure across time right but
there could be a lot of variation with

10746
02:55:39,030 --> 02:55:39,040
there could be a lot of variation with
 

10747
02:55:39,040 --> 02:55:40,469
there could be a lot of variation with
this yeah so the question we're all

10748
02:55:40,469 --> 02:55:40,479
this yeah so the question we're all
 

10749
02:55:40,479 --> 02:55:42,630
this yeah so the question we're all
interested in is how many

10750
02:55:42,630 --> 02:55:42,640
interested in is how many
 

10751
02:55:42,640 --> 02:55:46,150
interested in is how many
independent origins of a complexifying

10752
02:55:46,150 --> 02:55:46,160
independent origins of a complexifying
 

10753
02:55:46,160 --> 02:55:48,790
independent origins of a complexifying
causal chain are there in the universe

10754
02:55:48,790 --> 02:55:48,800
causal chain are there in the universe
 

10755
02:55:48,800 --> 02:55:49,830
causal chain are there in the universe
see but

10756
02:55:49,830 --> 02:55:49,840
see but
 

10757
02:55:49,840 --> 02:55:53,190
see but
is the idea of origin

10758
02:55:53,190 --> 02:55:53,200
is the idea of origin
 

10759
02:55:53,200 --> 02:55:55,030
is the idea of origin
is easy for you to define

10760
02:55:55,030 --> 02:55:55,040
is easy for you to define
 

10761
02:55:55,040 --> 02:55:56,630
is easy for you to define
because like um well

10762
02:55:56,630 --> 02:55:56,640
because like um well
 

10763
02:55:56,640 --> 02:55:58,710
because like um well
when the two when the species split in

10764
02:55:58,710 --> 02:55:58,720
when the two when the species split in
 

10765
02:55:58,720 --> 02:56:00,550

the evolutionary process

10766
02:56:00,550 --> 02:56:00,560
the evolutionary process
 

10767
02:56:00,560 --> 02:56:04,150
the evolutionary process
and you get like um

10768
02:56:04,150 --> 02:56:04,160

 

10769

isn't there let me make a distinction

10774
02:56:11,269 --> 02:56:11,279
isn't there let me make a distinction
 

10775
02:56:11,279 --> 02:56:14,710
isn't there let me make a distinction
here um quickly so i think um sorry to

10776
02:56:14,710 --> 02:56:14,720
here um quickly so i think um sorry to
 

10777
02:56:14,720 --> 02:56:15,990
here um quickly so i think um sorry to
interrupt um

10778
02:56:15,990 --> 02:56:16,000
interrupt um
 

10779
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:18,150
interrupt um
what we're saying i mean i mean i mean

10780
02:56:18,150 --> 02:56:18,160
what we're saying i mean i mean i mean
 

10781
02:56:18,160 --> 02:56:19,910
what we're saying i mean i mean i mean
i mean sarah what we won that argument

10782
02:56:19,910 --> 02:56:19,920
i mean sarah what we won that argument
 

10783
02:56:19,920 --> 02:56:22,230
i mean sarah what we won that argument
because she i think she's right that um

10784
02:56:22,230 --> 02:56:22,240
because she i think she's right that um
 

10785
02:56:22,240 --> 02:56:23,590

competed competing and got better and
 

10811
02:56:43,279 --> 02:56:45,110
competed competing and got better and
better ribosomes and suddenly that was a

02:56:45,110 --> 02:56:45,120
better ribosomes and suddenly that was a
 

10813
02:56:45,120 --> 02:56:47,269

interrupted you is say that once

10822
02:56:54,790 --> 02:56:54,800
interrupted you is say that once
 

10823
02:56:54,800 --> 02:56:56,309

02:57:36,960 --> 02:57:38,870
with the other and then you go on and
then you have this kind of

10872
02:57:38,870 --> 02:57:38,880
then you have this kind of
 

10873
02:57:38,880 --> 02:57:40,710
then you have this kind of
this average and sure there might be

10874
02:57:40,710 --> 02:57:40,720
this average and sure there might be
 

10875
02:57:40,720 --> 02:57:43,269
this average and sure there might be
re-speciation it might be have two types

10876
02:57:43,269 --> 02:57:43,279
re-speciation it might be have two types
 

10877
02:57:43,279 --> 02:57:45,110
re-speciation it might be have two types
of emerging chemistry it almost looks

10878
02:57:45,110 --> 02:57:45,120
of emerging chemistry it almost looks
 

10879
02:57:45,120 --> 02:57:46,630
of emerging chemistry it almost looks
like the origin of life on earth

10880
02:57:46,630 --> 02:57:46,640
like the origin of life on earth
 

10881
02:57:46,640 --> 02:57:49,990
like the origin of life on earth
required two different pre-life forms

10882
02:57:49,990 --> 02:57:50,000
required two different pre-life forms
 

10883
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:52,309
required two different pre-life forms
the peptide world and the rna world

10884
02:57:52,309 --> 02:57:52,319
the peptide world and the rna world
 

10885
02:57:52,319 --> 02:57:54,389
the peptide world and the rna world
somehow they got together and by

10886
02:57:54,389 --> 02:57:54,399
somehow they got together and by
 

10887
02:57:54,399 --> 02:57:56,950
somehow they got together and by
combining you got the ribosome and that

10888
02:57:56,950 --> 02:57:56,960
combining you got the ribosome and that
 

10889
02:57:56,960 --> 02:57:58,870
combining you got the ribosome and that
was the minimum competent entity for

10890
02:57:58,870 --> 02:57:58,880
was the minimum competent entity for
 

10891
02:57:58,880 --> 02:58:00,550
was the minimum competent entity for
evolution and

10892
02:58:00,550 --> 02:58:00,560
evolution and
 

10893
02:58:00,560 --> 02:58:03,030
evolution and
would all alien civilizations

10894
02:58:03,030 --> 02:58:03,040
would all alien civilizations
 

10895
02:58:03,040 --> 02:58:05,269
would all alien civilizations
have an evolutionary process

10896
02:58:05,269 --> 02:58:05,279
have an evolutionary process
 

10897
02:58:05,279 --> 02:58:06,630
have an evolutionary process
on a planet

10898
02:58:06,630 --> 02:58:06,640
on a planet
 

10899
02:58:06,640 --> 02:58:08,790
on a planet
so like that's one of the almost it's

10900
02:58:08,790 --> 02:58:08,800
so like that's one of the almost it's
 

10901
02:58:08,800 --> 02:58:10,790
so like that's one of the almost it's
almost the definition of life to create

10902
02:58:10,790 --> 02:58:10,800
almost the definition of life to create
 

10903
02:58:10,800 --> 02:58:13,269
almost the definition of life to create
all those memories you have to

10904
02:58:13,269 --> 02:58:13,279
all those memories you have to
 

10905
02:58:13,279 --> 02:58:15,429
all those memories you have to
have something like change in time yeah

10906
02:58:15,429 --> 02:58:15,439
have something like change in time yeah
 

10907
02:58:15,439 --> 02:58:19,110
have something like change in time yeah
and then but there has to be selection

10908
02:58:19,110 --> 02:58:19,120
and then but there has to be selection
 

10909
02:58:19,120 --> 02:58:20,870
and then but there has to be selection
um that's like an official there's no

10910
02:58:20,870 --> 02:58:20,880
um that's like an official there's no
 

10911
02:58:20,880 --> 02:58:23,590
um that's like an official there's no
other way to do it no i don't well never

10912
02:58:23,590 --> 02:58:23,600
other way to do it no i don't well never
 

10913
02:58:23,600 --> 02:58:24,790
other way to do it no i don't well never
say never because students say that's

10914
02:58:24,790 --> 02:58:24,800
say never because students say that's
 

10915
02:58:24,800 --> 02:58:26,389
say never because students say that's
what that's the part that depresses me

10916
02:58:26,389 --> 02:58:26,399
what that's the part that depresses me
 

10917
02:58:26,399 --> 02:58:28,389
what that's the part that depresses me
though going back to like i don't know

10918
02:58:28,389 --> 02:58:28,399
though going back to like i don't know
 

10919
02:58:28,399 --> 02:58:29,910
though going back to like i don't know
the earlier discussion on violence and

10920
02:58:29,910 --> 02:58:29,920
the earlier discussion on violence and
 

10921
02:58:29,920 --> 02:58:32,230
the earlier discussion on violence and
things like and i i don't know where

10922
02:58:32,230 --> 02:58:32,240
things like and i i don't know where
 

10923
02:58:32,240 --> 02:58:33,510
things like and i i don't know where
somebody was tweeting about this

10924
02:58:33,510 --> 02:58:33,520
somebody was tweeting about this
 

10925
02:58:33,520 --> 02:58:35,110
somebody was tweeting about this
recently but like you know how much

10926
02:58:35,110 --> 02:58:35,120
recently but like you know how much
 

10927
02:58:35,120 --> 02:58:37,269
recently but like you know how much
stuff had to die

10928
02:58:37,269 --> 02:58:37,279
stuff had to die
 

10929
02:58:37,279 --> 02:58:40,630
stuff had to die
maybe it was you yeah ah yeah so

10930
02:58:40,630 --> 02:58:40,640
maybe it was you yeah ah yeah so
 

10931
02:58:40,640 --> 02:58:42,309
maybe it was you yeah ah yeah so
yes sorry so we were talking we're

10932
02:58:42,309 --> 02:58:42,319
yes sorry so we were talking we're
 

10933
02:58:42,319 --> 02:58:44,950
yes sorry so we were talking we're
talking about life yeah and uh

10934
02:58:44,950 --> 02:58:44,960
talking about life yeah and uh
 

10935
02:58:44,960 --> 02:58:48,389
talking about life yeah and uh
i guess a lot of murder had to occur

10936
02:58:48,389 --> 02:58:48,399
i guess a lot of murder had to occur
 

10937
02:58:48,399 --> 02:58:50,550
i guess a lot of murder had to occur
right so selection means things had to

10938
02:58:50,550 --> 02:58:50,560
right so selection means things had to
 

10939
02:58:50,560 --> 02:58:52,950
right so selection means things had to
be weeded out right so well we can

10940
02:58:52,950 --> 02:58:52,960
be weeded out right so well we can
 

10941
02:58:52,960 --> 02:58:55,030
be weeded out right so well we can
celebrate that death makes way for too

10942
02:58:55,030 --> 02:58:55,040
celebrate that death makes way for too
 

10943
02:58:55,040 --> 02:58:57,269
celebrate that death makes way for too
long yeah i mean it and also you know

10944
02:58:57,269 --> 02:58:57,279
long yeah i mean it and also you know
 

10945
02:58:57,279 --> 02:58:59,269
long yeah i mean it and also you know
one of the most interesting features of

10946
02:58:59,269 --> 02:58:59,279
one of the most interesting features of
 

10947
02:58:59,279 --> 02:59:00,950
one of the most interesting features of
major extinction events in the history

10948
02:59:00,950 --> 02:59:00,960
major extinction events in the history
 

10949
02:59:00,960 --> 02:59:03,269
major extinction events in the history
of our planet is how much novelty

10950
02:59:03,269 --> 02:59:03,279
of our planet is how much novelty
 

10951
02:59:03,279 --> 02:59:05,510
of our planet is how much novelty
emerged immediately after

10952
02:59:05,510 --> 02:59:05,520
emerged immediately after
 

10953
02:59:05,520 --> 02:59:07,349
emerged immediately after
right so and of course you know a lot of

10954
02:59:07,349 --> 02:59:07,359
right so and of course you know a lot of
 

10955
02:59:07,359 --> 02:59:08,550
right so and of course you know a lot of
people make arguments we wouldn't be

10956
02:59:08,550 --> 02:59:08,560
people make arguments we wouldn't be
 

10957
02:59:08,560 --> 02:59:10,710
people make arguments we wouldn't be
here if the dinosaurs didn't go extinct

10958
02:59:10,710 --> 02:59:10,720
here if the dinosaurs didn't go extinct
 

10959
02:59:10,720 --> 02:59:11,590
here if the dinosaurs didn't go extinct
so

10960
02:59:11,590 --> 02:59:11,600
so
 

10961
02:59:11,600 --> 02:59:12,469
so
um

10962
02:59:12,469 --> 02:59:12,479
um
 

10963
02:59:12,479 --> 02:59:14,950
um
in some ways we can attribute our

10964
02:59:14,950 --> 02:59:14,960
in some ways we can attribute our
 

10965
02:59:14,960 --> 02:59:17,190
in some ways we can attribute our
existence to all of that but i guess i

10966
02:59:17,190 --> 02:59:17,200
existence to all of that but i guess i
 

10967
02:59:17,200 --> 02:59:19,510
existence to all of that but i guess i
was just wondering and sort of like if i

10968
02:59:19,510 --> 02:59:19,520
was just wondering and sort of like if i
 

10969
02:59:19,520 --> 02:59:22,469
was just wondering and sort of like if i
was going to build a universe myself

10970
02:59:22,469 --> 02:59:22,479
was going to build a universe myself
 

10971
02:59:22,479 --> 02:59:23,750
was going to build a universe myself
in the most optimistic way would i

10972
02:59:23,750 --> 02:59:23,760
in the most optimistic way would i
 

10973
02:59:23,760 --> 02:59:25,510
in the most optimistic way would i
retain that feature but it does seem to

10974
02:59:25,510 --> 02:59:25,520
retain that feature but it does seem to
 

10975
02:59:25,520 --> 02:59:27,269
retain that feature but it does seem to
be a yeah you have to i mean i think

10976
02:59:27,269 --> 02:59:27,279
be a yeah you have to i mean i think
 

10977
02:59:27,279 --> 02:59:29,750
be a yeah you have to i mean i think
we're i think we're probably being over

10978
02:59:29,750 --> 02:59:29,760
we're i think we're probably being over
 

10979
02:59:29,760 --> 02:59:31,510
we're i think we're probably being over
um anthropomorphizing i remember

10980
02:59:31,510 --> 02:59:31,520
um anthropomorphizing i remember
 

10981
02:59:31,520 --> 02:59:33,110
um anthropomorphizing i remember
watching uh the blue i think it was the

10982
02:59:33,110 --> 02:59:33,120
watching uh the blue i think it was the
 

10983
02:59:33,120 --> 02:59:34,389
watching uh the blue i think it was the
blue planet david attenborough was

10984
02:59:34,389 --> 02:59:34,399
blue planet david attenborough was
 

10985
02:59:34,399 --> 02:59:35,429
blue planet david attenborough was
showing these seals and because of

10986
02:59:35,429 --> 02:59:35,439
showing these seals and because of
 

10987
02:59:35,439 --> 02:59:37,750
showing these seals and because of
climate change some seals were falling

10988
02:59:37,750 --> 02:59:37,760
climate change some seals were falling
 

10989
02:59:37,760 --> 02:59:39,590
climate change some seals were falling
off a cliff and how tragic it was i was

10990
02:59:39,590 --> 02:59:39,600
off a cliff and how tragic it was i was
 

10991
02:59:39,600 --> 02:59:40,389
off a cliff and how tragic it was i was
like

10992
02:59:40,389 --> 02:59:40,399
like
 

10993
02:59:40,399 --> 02:59:42,870
like
i'm saying my son that's pretty cool

10994
02:59:42,870 --> 02:59:42,880
i'm saying my son that's pretty cool
 

10995
02:59:42,880 --> 02:59:44,230
i'm saying my son that's pretty cool
look at look at those ones down there

10996
02:59:44,230 --> 02:59:44,240
look at look at those ones down there
 

10997
02:59:44,240 --> 02:59:45,110
look at look at those ones down there
they've obviously got some kind of

10998
02:59:45,110 --> 02:59:45,120
they've obviously got some kind of
 

10999
02:59:45,120 --> 02:59:46,870
they've obviously got some kind of
mutations some and they're not doing

11000
02:59:46,870 --> 02:59:46,880
mutations some and they're not doing
 

11001
02:59:46,880 --> 02:59:49,349
mutations some and they're not doing
that daft thing and so that that that

11002
02:59:49,349 --> 02:59:49,359
that daft thing and so that that that
 

11003
02:59:49,359 --> 02:59:51,750
that daft thing and so that that that
poor gene will be weeded out of course

11004
02:59:51,750 --> 02:59:51,760
poor gene will be weeded out of course
 

11005
02:59:51,760 --> 02:59:54,550
poor gene will be weeded out of course
at the individual level it looks tragic

11006
02:59:54,550 --> 02:59:54,560
at the individual level it looks tragic
 

11007
02:59:54,560 --> 02:59:55,910
at the individual level it looks tragic
and of course as human beings have the

11008
02:59:55,910 --> 02:59:55,920
and of course as human beings have the
 

11009
02:59:55,920 --> 02:59:57,910
and of course as human beings have the
ability to abstract and we empathize we

11010
02:59:57,910 --> 02:59:57,920
ability to abstract and we empathize we
 

11011
02:59:57,920 --> 02:59:59,349
ability to abstract and we empathize we
don't want to cause suffering on other

11012
02:59:59,349 --> 02:59:59,359
don't want to cause suffering on other
 

11013
02:59:59,359 --> 03:00:01,349
don't want to cause suffering on other
human beings and we should retain that

11014
03:00:01,349 --> 03:00:01,359
human beings and we should retain that
 

11015
03:00:01,359 --> 03:00:03,349
human beings and we should retain that
but we shouldn't look back in time and

11016
03:00:03,349 --> 03:00:03,359
but we shouldn't look back in time and
 

11017
03:00:03,359 --> 03:00:04,230
but we shouldn't look back in time and
say

11018
03:00:04,230 --> 03:00:04,240
say
 

11019
03:00:04,240 --> 03:00:06,630
say
you know how many butterflies

11020
03:00:06,630 --> 03:00:06,640
you know how many butterflies
 

11021
03:00:06,640 --> 03:00:08,230
you know how many butterflies
had to die

11022
03:00:08,230 --> 03:00:08,240
had to die
 

11023
03:00:08,240 --> 03:00:11,269
had to die
i remember making with this how many

11024
03:00:11,269 --> 03:00:11,279
i remember making with this how many
 

11025
03:00:11,279 --> 03:00:13,110
i remember making with this how many
if you think about the caterpillar

11026
03:00:13,110 --> 03:00:13,120
if you think about the caterpillar
 

11027
03:00:13,120 --> 03:00:14,389
if you think about the caterpillar
become the chrysalis and then the

11028
03:00:14,389 --> 03:00:14,399
become the chrysalis and then the
 

11029
03:00:14,399 --> 03:00:15,990
become the chrysalis and then the
butterfly getting out

11030
03:00:15,990 --> 03:00:16,000
butterfly getting out
 

11031
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:18,230
butterfly getting out
how many if that suffering we call it

11032
03:00:18,230 --> 03:00:18,240
how many if that suffering we call it
 

11033
03:00:18,240 --> 03:00:20,550
how many if that suffering we call it
suffering if that process of pruning had

11034
03:00:20,550 --> 03:00:20,560
suffering if that process of pruning had
 

11035
03:00:20,560 --> 03:00:23,030
suffering if that process of pruning had
not occurred we have no butterflies so

11036
03:00:23,030 --> 03:00:23,040
not occurred we have no butterflies so
 

11037
03:00:23,040 --> 03:00:24,389
not occurred we have no butterflies so
none of the butterfly beauty in the

11038
03:00:24,389 --> 03:00:24,399
none of the butterfly beauty in the
 

11039
03:00:24,399 --> 03:00:26,870
none of the butterfly beauty in the
world without all that pruning so

11040
03:00:26,870 --> 03:00:26,880
world without all that pruning so
 

11041
03:00:26,880 --> 03:00:29,190
world without all that pruning so
pruning is required but we shouldn't

11042
03:00:29,190 --> 03:00:29,200
pruning is required but we shouldn't
 

11043
03:00:29,200 --> 03:00:31,030
pruning is required but we shouldn't
amphimorphize and feel sorry for the

11044
03:00:31,030 --> 03:00:31,040
amphimorphize and feel sorry for the
 

11045
03:00:31,040 --> 03:00:33,190
amphimorphize and feel sorry for the
biological entities

11046
03:00:33,190 --> 03:00:33,200
biological entities
 

11047
03:00:33,200 --> 03:00:35,349
biological entities
but because that's that seems to be a

11048
03:00:35,349 --> 03:00:35,359
but because that's that seems to be a
 

11049
03:00:35,359 --> 03:00:37,030
but because that's that seems to be a
backwards way of looking at it what we

11050
03:00:37,030 --> 03:00:37,040
backwards way of looking at it what we
 

11051
03:00:37,040 --> 03:00:39,830
backwards way of looking at it what we
should do is project forward and maybe

11052
03:00:39,830 --> 03:00:39,840
should do is project forward and maybe
 

11053
03:00:39,840 --> 03:00:41,750
should do is project forward and maybe
think about what values we have across

11054
03:00:41,750 --> 03:00:41,760
think about what values we have across
 

11055
03:00:41,760 --> 03:00:43,750
think about what values we have across
our species our ecosystem and our fellow

human beings you know you know now that
 

11059
03:00:46,160 --> 03:00:47,990
human beings you know you know now that
we know that animals suffer at some

11060
03:00:47,990 --> 03:00:48,000
we know that animals suffer at some
 

11061
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:49,990

think about humane farming when we find

11064
03:00:51,830 --> 03:00:51,840
think about humane farming when we find
 

11065
03:00:51,840 --> 03:00:53,590
think about humane farming when we find
that plants can in fact are conscious

11066

that plants can in fact are conscious
 

11067
03:00:53,600 --> 03:00:55,510
that plants can in fact are conscious
and can think and have pain then we'll

11068
03:00:55,510 --> 03:00:55,520
and can think and have pain then we'll
 

11069
03:00:55,520 --> 03:00:56,870
and can think and have pain then we'll
do

know the like certain things can

03:02:00,479 --> 03:02:01,750
know the like certain things can
co-exist so the universe is trying to

co-exist so the universe is trying to
 

11135

co-exist so the universe is trying to
maximize existence but there's some

03:02:03,269 --> 03:02:03,279
maximize existence but there's some
 

11137
03:02:03,279 --> 03:02:04,870
maximize existence but there's some
things that just

11138

things that just
 

11139
03:02:04,880 --> 03:02:06,309

bacteria if you look at virus i mean
 

11169
03:02:31,840 --> 03:02:33,990
bacteria if you look at virus i mean
just just the number of organisms that

11170
03:02:33,990 --> 03:02:34,000
just just the number of organisms that
 

11171
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:35,990
just just the number of organisms that
are constantly like looking at bacteria

11172
03:02:35,990 --> 03:02:36,000
are constantly like looking at bacteria
 

11173
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:37,830

mean like there's the whole thing about
 

11181
03:02:42,080 --> 03:02:43,349
mean like there's the whole thing about
like why does the universe enable

11182
03:02:43,349 --> 03:02:43,359
like why does the universe enable
 

11183
03:02:43,359 --> 03:02:46,070
like why does the universe enable
suffering individuals don't exist right

11184
03:02:46,070 --> 03:02:46,080
suffering individuals don't exist right
 

11185
03:02:46,080 --> 03:02:48,389
suffering individuals don't exist right
in individual so for this i think if you

11186
03:02:48,389 --> 03:02:48,399
in individual so for this i think if you
 

11187
03:02:48,399 --> 03:02:50,150
in individual so for this i think if you
think about life as an entity on earth

11188
03:02:50,150 --> 03:02:50,160
think about life as an entity on earth
 

11189
03:02:50,160 --> 03:02:51,590
think about life as an entity on earth
right

11190
03:02:51,590 --> 03:02:51,600
right
 

11191
03:02:51,600 --> 03:02:53,670
right
let's just let's just go back a second i

11192
03:02:53,670 --> 03:02:53,680
let's just let's just go back a second i
 

11193
03:02:53,680 --> 03:02:55,269
let's just let's just go back a second i
mean i like to i'll be ludicrous for a

11194
03:02:55,269 --> 03:02:55,279
mean i like to i'll be ludicrous for a
 

11195
03:02:55,279 --> 03:02:57,110
mean i like to i'll be ludicrous for a
second i don't exist you don't exist

11196
03:02:57,110 --> 03:02:57,120
second i don't exist you don't exist
 

11197
03:02:57,120 --> 03:03:00,630
second i don't exist you don't exist
right um but you but the actions you do

11198
03:03:00,630 --> 03:03:00,640
right um but you but the actions you do
 

11199
03:03:00,640 --> 03:03:02,389
right um but you but the actions you do
the product of evolution exists right

11200
03:03:02,389 --> 03:03:02,399
the product of evolution exists right
 

11201
03:03:02,399 --> 03:03:05,110
the product of evolution exists right
the objects you create exist

11202
03:03:05,110 --> 03:03:05,120
the objects you create exist
 

11203
03:03:05,120 --> 03:03:07,590
the objects you create exist
quantitatively in the real world if you

11204
03:03:07,590 --> 03:03:07,600
quantitatively in the real world if you
 

11205
03:03:07,600 --> 03:03:09,830
quantitatively in the real world if you
then understand life on earth or alien

11206
03:03:09,830 --> 03:03:09,840
then understand life on earth or alien
 

11207
03:03:09,840 --> 03:03:11,349
then understand life on earth or alien
life or any life in the universe there's

11208
03:03:11,349 --> 03:03:11,359
life or any life in the universe there's
 

11209
03:03:11,359 --> 03:03:13,590
life or any life in the universe there's
this integrated entity

11210
03:03:13,590 --> 03:03:13,600
this integrated entity
 

11211
03:03:13,600 --> 03:03:15,349
this integrated entity
where you need you need cells in your

11212
03:03:15,349 --> 03:03:15,359
where you need you need cells in your
 

11213
03:03:15,359 --> 03:03:17,510
where you need you need cells in your
body to die otherwise you'd just get

11214
03:03:17,510 --> 03:03:17,520
body to die otherwise you'd just get
 

11215
03:03:17,520 --> 03:03:18,710
body to die otherwise you'd just get
really big

11216
03:03:18,710 --> 03:03:18,720
really big
 

11217
03:03:18,720 --> 03:03:19,910
really big
and you wouldn't be able to walk around

11218
03:03:19,910 --> 03:03:19,920
and you wouldn't be able to walk around
 

11219
03:03:19,920 --> 03:03:22,870
and you wouldn't be able to walk around
right so you know you do

11220
03:03:22,870 --> 03:03:22,880
right so you know you do
 

11221
03:03:22,880 --> 03:03:24,469
right so you know you do
yeah yeah

11222
03:03:24,469 --> 03:03:24,479
yeah yeah
 

11223
03:03:24,479 --> 03:03:27,190
yeah yeah
yeah so yeah so i think

11224
03:03:27,190 --> 03:03:27,200
yeah so yeah so i think
 

11225
03:03:27,200 --> 03:03:28,469
yeah so yeah so i think
the patterns that persist not the

11226
03:03:28,469 --> 03:03:28,479
the patterns that persist not the
 

11227
03:03:28,479 --> 03:03:29,990
the patterns that persist not the
physical things and of course we you

11228
03:03:29,990 --> 03:03:30,000
physical things and of course we you
 

11229
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:32,469
physical things and of course we you
know we have we have we place and

11230
03:03:32,469 --> 03:03:32,479
know we have we have we place and
 

11231
03:03:32,479 --> 03:03:34,230
know we have we have we place and
mention values on fellow human beings

11232
03:03:34,230 --> 03:03:34,240
mention values on fellow human beings
 

11233
03:03:34,240 --> 03:03:35,110
mention values on fellow human beings
and i'm

11234
03:03:35,110 --> 03:03:35,120
and i'm
 

11235
03:03:35,120 --> 03:03:37,750
and i'm
my majestic professor does like other

11236
03:03:37,750 --> 03:03:37,760
my majestic professor does like other
 

11237
03:03:37,760 --> 03:03:39,349
my majestic professor does like other
individual human beings or now you're

11238
03:03:39,349 --> 03:03:39,359
individual human beings or now you're
 

11239
03:03:39,359 --> 03:03:41,030
individual human beings or now you're
talking in third person too i know it

11240
03:03:41,030 --> 03:03:41,040
talking in third person too i know it
 

11241
03:03:41,040 --> 03:03:43,190
talking in third person too i know it
happens right so death would you say i

11242
03:03:43,190 --> 03:03:43,200
happens right so death would you say i
 

11243
03:03:43,200 --> 03:03:44,790
happens right so death would you say i
mean because you said evolution is a

11244
03:03:44,790 --> 03:03:44,800
mean because you said evolution is a
 

11245
03:03:44,800 --> 03:03:47,349
mean because you said evolution is a
fundamental part of um

11246
03:03:47,349 --> 03:03:47,359
fundamental part of um
 

11247
03:03:47,359 --> 03:03:49,429
fundamental part of um
life so death is a fundamental part of

11248
03:03:49,429 --> 03:03:49,439
life so death is a fundamental part of
 

11249
03:03:49,439 --> 03:03:51,670
life so death is a fundamental part of
life yeah

11250
03:03:51,670 --> 03:03:51,680
life yeah
 

11251
03:03:51,680 --> 03:03:53,190
life yeah
it might right now it might not be in

11252
03:03:53,190 --> 03:03:53,200
it might right now it might not be in
 

11253
03:03:53,200 --> 03:03:55,670
it might right now it might not be in
the future we might hack some aspects of

11254
03:03:55,670 --> 03:03:55,680
the future we might hack some aspects of
 

11255
03:03:55,680 --> 03:03:56,630
the future we might hack some aspects of
death

11256
03:03:56,630 --> 03:03:56,640
death
 

11257
03:03:56,640 --> 03:03:57,990
death
we could and will evolve in different

11258
03:03:57,990 --> 03:03:58,000
we could and will evolve in different
 

11259
03:03:58,000 --> 03:04:00,230
we could and will evolve in different
ways but isn't there i think sarah

11260
03:04:00,230 --> 03:04:00,240
ways but isn't there i think sarah
 

11261
03:04:00,240 --> 03:04:03,670
ways but isn't there i think sarah
mentioned like this life density

11262
03:04:03,670 --> 03:04:03,680
mentioned like this life density
 

11263
03:04:03,680 --> 03:04:05,990
mentioned like this life density
um is it can't that become a problem

11264
03:04:05,990 --> 03:04:06,000
um is it can't that become a problem
 

11265
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:07,670
um is it can't that become a problem
like too much

11266
03:04:07,670 --> 03:04:07,680
like too much
 

11267
03:04:07,680 --> 03:04:09,830
like too much
to too much uh bureaucracy too much of

11268
03:04:09,830 --> 03:04:09,840
to too much uh bureaucracy too much of
 

11269
03:04:09,840 --> 03:04:11,910
to too much uh bureaucracy too much of
baggage uh builds up like you need to

11270
03:04:11,910 --> 03:04:11,920
baggage uh builds up like you need to
 

11271
03:04:11,920 --> 03:04:13,429
baggage uh builds up like you need to
keep

11272
03:04:13,429 --> 03:04:13,439
keep
 

11273
03:04:13,439 --> 03:04:15,590
keep
erasing okay that we dissipate like i

11274
03:04:15,590 --> 03:04:15,600
erasing okay that we dissipate like i
 

11275
03:04:15,600 --> 03:04:16,710
erasing okay that we dissipate like i
don't think of like like i'm

11276
03:04:16,710 --> 03:04:16,720
don't think of like like i'm
 

11277
03:04:16,720 --> 03:04:19,590
don't think of like like i'm
disappearing yes no but i mean like like

11278
03:04:19,590 --> 03:04:19,600
disappearing yes no but i mean like like
 

11279
03:04:19,600 --> 03:04:21,030
disappearing yes no but i mean like like
we're so fixated on ourselves as

11280
03:04:21,030 --> 03:04:21,040
we're so fixated on ourselves as
 

11281
03:04:21,040 --> 03:04:23,349
we're so fixated on ourselves as
individuals and agents and we were

11282
03:04:23,349 --> 03:04:23,359
individuals and agents and we were
 

11283
03:04:23,359 --> 03:04:25,190
individuals and agents and we were
talking about this last night actually

11284
03:04:25,190 --> 03:04:25,200
talking about this last night actually
 

11285
03:04:25,200 --> 03:04:26,710
talking about this last night actually
over dinner but like

11286
03:04:26,710 --> 03:04:26,720
over dinner but like
 

11287
03:04:26,720 --> 03:04:28,469
over dinner but like
um you know an individual persists for a

11288
03:04:28,469 --> 03:04:28,479
um you know an individual persists for a
 

11289
03:04:28,479 --> 03:04:30,630
um you know an individual persists for a
certain amount of time but what you want

11290
03:04:30,630 --> 03:04:30,640
certain amount of time but what you want
 

11291
03:04:30,640 --> 03:04:32,469
certain amount of time but what you want
to do like if you're really concerned

11292
03:04:32,469 --> 03:04:32,479
to do like if you're really concerned
 

11293
03:04:32,479 --> 03:04:34,550
to do like if you're really concerned
with immortality is not to live

11294
03:04:34,550 --> 03:04:34,560
with immortality is not to live
 

11295
03:04:34,560 --> 03:04:36,070
with immortality is not to live
indefinitely as an individual but

11296
03:04:36,070 --> 03:04:36,080
indefinitely as an individual but
 

11297
03:04:36,080 --> 03:04:38,070
indefinitely as an individual but
maximize your causal impact so like what

11298
03:04:38,070 --> 03:04:38,080
maximize your causal impact so like what
 

11299
03:04:38,080 --> 03:04:40,389
maximize your causal impact so like what
are the traces of you that are left

11300
03:04:40,389 --> 03:04:40,399
are the traces of you that are left
 

11301
03:04:40,399 --> 03:04:42,790
are the traces of you that are left
i and and you're still a real i always

11302
03:04:42,790 --> 03:04:42,800
i and and you're still a real i always
 

11303
03:04:42,800 --> 03:04:45,349
i and and you're still a real i always
think of einstein like for a period of

11304
03:04:45,349 --> 03:04:45,359
think of einstein like for a period of
 

11305
03:04:45,359 --> 03:04:47,429
think of einstein like for a period of
time he was a real physical thing we

11306
03:04:47,429 --> 03:04:47,439
time he was a real physical thing we
 

11307
03:04:47,439 --> 03:04:49,030
time he was a real physical thing we
would identify as a human and now we

11308
03:04:49,030 --> 03:04:49,040
would identify as a human and now we
 

11309
03:04:49,040 --> 03:04:51,190
would identify as a human and now we
just see echoes of that human in all of

11310
03:04:51,190 --> 03:04:51,200
just see echoes of that human in all of
 

11311
03:04:51,200 --> 03:04:53,190
just see echoes of that human in all of
the ways that we talk about his you know

11312
03:04:53,190 --> 03:04:53,200
the ways that we talk about his you know
 

11313
03:04:53,200 --> 03:04:54,950
the ways that we talk about his you know
causal impact or frankly right is

11314
03:04:54,950 --> 03:04:54,960
causal impact or frankly right is
 

11315
03:04:54,960 --> 03:04:56,389
causal impact or frankly right is
another great example because how many

11316
03:04:56,389 --> 03:04:56,399
another great example because how many
 

11317
03:04:56,399 --> 03:04:58,070
another great example because how many
easter eggs can you leave in the future

11318
03:04:58,070 --> 03:04:58,080
easter eggs can you leave in the future
 

11319
03:04:58,080 --> 03:04:59,670
easter eggs can you leave in the future
say hello

11320
03:04:59,670 --> 03:04:59,680
say hello
 

11321
03:04:59,680 --> 03:05:01,590
say hello
so i guess the the question is how much

11322
03:05:01,590 --> 03:05:01,600
so i guess the the question is how much
 

11323
03:05:01,600 --> 03:05:04,230
so i guess the the question is how much
do you want to control the localization

11324
03:05:04,230 --> 03:05:04,240
do you want to control the localization
 

11325
03:05:04,240 --> 03:05:05,030
do you want to control the localization
of

11326
03:05:05,030 --> 03:05:05,040
of
 

11327
03:05:05,040 --> 03:05:06,469
of
certain features

11328
03:05:06,469 --> 03:05:06,479
certain features
 

11329
03:05:06,479 --> 03:05:09,590
certain features
of say a prop a packet of propagating

11330
03:05:09,590 --> 03:05:09,600
of say a prop a packet of propagating
 

11331
03:05:09,600 --> 03:05:11,429
of say a prop a packet of propagating
information we might call a person and

11332
03:05:11,429 --> 03:05:11,439
information we might call a person and
 

11333
03:05:11,439 --> 03:05:13,510
information we might call a person and
keep them localized to one individual

11334
03:05:13,510 --> 03:05:13,520
keep them localized to one individual
 

11335
03:05:13,520 --> 03:05:15,670
keep them localized to one individual
physical structure do you wanna you know

11336
03:05:15,670 --> 03:05:15,680
physical structure do you wanna you know
 

11337
03:05:15,680 --> 03:05:16,950
physical structure do you wanna you know
is there a time when that just becomes a

11338
03:05:16,950 --> 03:05:16,960
is there a time when that just becomes a
 

11339
03:05:16,960 --> 03:05:18,469
is there a time when that just becomes a
dissipated feature

11340
03:05:18,469 --> 03:05:18,479
dissipated feature
 

11341
03:05:18,479 --> 03:05:19,429
dissipated feature
of

11342
03:05:19,429 --> 03:05:19,439
of
 

11343
03:05:19,439 --> 03:05:21,990
of
the society that it once existed in and

11344
03:05:21,990 --> 03:05:22,000
the society that it once existed in and
 

11345
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:23,269
the society that it once existed in and
i'm okay with the dissipated feature

11346
03:05:23,269 --> 03:05:23,279
i'm okay with the dissipated feature
 

11347
03:05:23,279 --> 03:05:24,790
i'm okay with the dissipated feature
because i just think

11348
03:05:24,790 --> 03:05:24,800
because i just think
 

11349
03:05:24,800 --> 03:05:26,550
because i just think
that makes more room for more creativity

11350
03:05:26,550 --> 03:05:26,560
that makes more room for more creativity
 

11351
03:05:26,560 --> 03:05:28,070
that makes more room for more creativity
in the future

11352
03:05:28,070 --> 03:05:28,080
in the future
 

11353
03:05:28,080 --> 03:05:30,710
in the future
so you mentioned engineering life in the

11354
03:05:30,710 --> 03:05:30,720
so you mentioned engineering life in the
 

11355
03:05:30,720 --> 03:05:32,230
so you mentioned engineering life in the
lab

11356
03:05:32,230 --> 03:05:32,240
lab
 

11357
03:05:32,240 --> 03:05:34,070
lab
let me take you to computer science

11358
03:05:34,070 --> 03:05:34,080
let me take you to computer science
 

11359
03:05:34,080 --> 03:05:35,830
let me take you to computer science
world

11360
03:05:35,830 --> 03:05:35,840
world
 

11361
03:05:35,840 --> 03:05:37,990
world
what about robots

11362
03:05:37,990 --> 03:05:38,000
what about robots
 

11363
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:40,710
what about robots
so

11364
03:05:40,710 --> 03:05:40,720

 

11365
03:05:40,720 --> 03:05:43,110

is it possible to engineer see because

11366
03:05:43,110 --> 03:05:43,120
is it possible to engineer see because
 

11367
03:05:43,120 --> 03:05:46,469
is it possible to engineer see because
you're really talking about

11368
03:05:46,469 --> 03:05:46,479
you're really talking about
 

11369
03:05:46,479 --> 03:05:48,630
you're really talking about
like engineering life at the chemistry

11370
03:05:48,630 --> 03:05:48,640
like engineering life at the chemistry
 

11371
03:05:48,640 --> 03:05:49,750
like engineering life at the chemistry
level

11372
03:05:49,750 --> 03:05:49,760
level
 

11373
03:05:49,760 --> 03:05:50,950
level
but do you think it's possible to

11374
03:05:50,950 --> 03:05:50,960
but do you think it's possible to
 

11375
03:05:50,960 --> 03:05:52,550
but do you think it's possible to
engineer

11376
03:05:52,550 --> 03:05:52,560
engineer
 

11377
03:05:52,560 --> 03:05:53,349
engineer
life

11378
03:05:53,349 --> 03:05:53,359
life
 

11379
03:05:53,359 --> 03:05:56,469
life
at the like humanoid level at the at the

11380
03:05:56,469 --> 03:05:56,479
at the like humanoid level at the at the
 

11381
03:05:56,479 --> 03:05:57,750
at the like humanoid level at the at the
dog level

11382
03:05:57,750 --> 03:05:57,760
dog level
 

11383
03:05:57,760 --> 03:06:00,469
dog level
like or is that like at which level can

11384
03:06:00,469 --> 03:06:00,479
like or is that like at which level can
 

11385
03:06:00,479 --> 03:06:03,349
like or is that like at which level can
we instill the magic of life into

11386
03:06:03,349 --> 03:06:03,359
we instill the magic of life into
 

11387
03:06:03,359 --> 03:06:05,830
we instill the magic of life into
uh inanimate stuff no i think you could

11388
03:06:05,830 --> 03:06:05,840
uh inanimate stuff no i think you could
 

11389
03:06:05,840 --> 03:06:07,670
uh inanimate stuff no i think you could
do it at every level i just think that

11390
03:06:07,670 --> 03:06:07,680
do it at every level i just think that
 

11391
03:06:07,680 --> 03:06:09,269
do it at every level i just think that
we're particularly interested in

11392
03:06:09,269 --> 03:06:09,279
we're particularly interested in
 

11393
03:06:09,279 --> 03:06:11,110
we're particularly interested in
chemistry because

11394
03:06:11,110 --> 03:06:11,120
chemistry because
 

11395
03:06:11,120 --> 03:06:12,150
chemistry because
it's the

11396
03:06:12,150 --> 03:06:12,160
it's the
 

11397
03:06:12,160 --> 03:06:14,469
it's the
origin life transition

11398
03:06:14,469 --> 03:06:14,479
origin life transition
 

11399
03:06:14,479 --> 03:06:15,990
origin life transition
that presumably or at least is how i

11400
03:06:15,990 --> 03:06:16,000
that presumably or at least is how i
 

11401
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:17,110
that presumably or at least is how i
feel about it it's going to give you the

11402
03:06:17,110 --> 03:06:17,120
feel about it it's going to give you the
 

11403
03:06:17,120 --> 03:06:18,870
feel about it it's going to give you the
most

11404
03:06:18,870 --> 03:06:18,880
most
 

11405
03:06:18,880 --> 03:06:21,429
most
and interesting or deepest insights into

11406
03:06:21,429 --> 03:06:21,439
and interesting or deepest insights into
 

11407
03:06:21,439 --> 03:06:22,550
and interesting or deepest insights into
the physics

11408
03:06:22,550 --> 03:06:22,560
the physics
 

11409
03:06:22,560 --> 03:06:23,590
the physics
but

11410
03:06:23,590 --> 03:06:23,600
but
 

11411
03:06:23,600 --> 03:06:25,349
but
presumably everything that we do and

11412
03:06:25,349 --> 03:06:25,359
presumably everything that we do and
 

11413
03:06:25,359 --> 03:06:26,790
presumably everything that we do and
build is an example of life and the

11414
03:06:26,790 --> 03:06:26,800
build is an example of life and the
 

11415
03:06:26,800 --> 03:06:28,389
build is an example of life and the
question is just how much

11416
03:06:28,389 --> 03:06:28,399
question is just how much
 

11417
03:06:28,399 --> 03:06:29,750
question is just how much
do you want to take from things that we

11418
03:06:29,750 --> 03:06:29,760
do you want to take from things that we
 

11419
03:06:29,760 --> 03:06:32,389
do you want to take from things that we
have now and put them into like examples

11420
03:06:32,389 --> 03:06:32,399
have now and put them into like examples
 

11421
03:06:32,399 --> 03:06:35,269
have now and put them into like examples
of life and copy them into machines

11422
03:06:35,269 --> 03:06:35,279
of life and copy them into machines
 

11423
03:06:35,279 --> 03:06:37,110
of life and copy them into machines
uh i saw that there was this

11424
03:06:37,110 --> 03:06:37,120
uh i saw that there was this
 

11425
03:06:37,120 --> 03:06:39,190
uh i saw that there was this
tweet again uh i think you're at the

11426
03:06:39,190 --> 03:06:39,200
tweet again uh i think you're at the
 

11427
03:06:39,200 --> 03:06:40,550
tweet again uh i think you're at the
mars conference and you were hanging out

11428
03:06:40,550 --> 03:06:40,560
mars conference and you were hanging out
 

11429
03:06:40,560 --> 03:06:43,750
mars conference and you were hanging out
with a humanoid robot yes

11430
03:06:43,750 --> 03:06:43,760
with a humanoid robot yes
 

11431
03:06:43,760 --> 03:06:46,630
with a humanoid robot yes
making lots of new friends at mars 2022

11432
03:06:46,630 --> 03:06:46,640
making lots of new friends at mars 2022
 

11433
03:06:46,640 --> 03:06:48,710
making lots of new friends at mars 2022
did you guys color match ahead of time

11434
03:06:48,710 --> 03:06:48,720
did you guys color match ahead of time
 

11435
03:06:48,720 --> 03:06:50,389
did you guys color match ahead of time
with the robot or

11436
03:06:50,389 --> 03:06:50,399
with the robot or
 

11437
03:06:50,399 --> 03:06:51,910
with the robot or
did that accidentally happen

11438
03:06:51,910 --> 03:06:51,920
did that accidentally happen
 

11439
03:06:51,920 --> 03:06:53,590
did that accidentally happen
accidentally i went up and i wanted to

11440
03:06:53,590 --> 03:06:53,600
accidentally i went up and i wanted to
 

11441
03:06:53,600 --> 03:06:55,590
accidentally i went up and i wanted to
say hi to the boys would that be the

11442
03:06:55,590 --> 03:06:55,600
say hi to the boys would that be the
 

11443
03:06:55,600 --> 03:06:58,309
say hi to the boys would that be the
correct name for the color i think so we

11444
03:06:58,309 --> 03:06:58,319
correct name for the color i think so we
 

11445
03:06:58,319 --> 03:07:00,550
correct name for the color i think so we
didn't color coordinate our outfits uh

11446
03:07:00,550 --> 03:07:00,560
didn't color coordinate our outfits uh
 

11447
03:07:00,560 --> 03:07:02,550
didn't color coordinate our outfits uh
well you didn't maybe through what did

11448
03:07:02,550 --> 03:07:02,560
well you didn't maybe through what did
 

11449
03:07:02,560 --> 03:07:05,030
well you didn't maybe through what did
the robot probably did much more stylish

11450
03:07:05,030 --> 03:07:05,040
the robot probably did much more stylish
 

11451
03:07:05,040 --> 03:07:06,389
the robot probably did much more stylish
so for people who are just listening

11452
03:07:06,389 --> 03:07:06,399
so for people who are just listening
 

11453
03:07:06,399 --> 03:07:08,870
so for people who are just listening
there's there's a picture of sarah

11454
03:07:08,870 --> 03:07:08,880
there's there's a picture of sarah
 

11455
03:07:08,880 --> 03:07:10,950
there's there's a picture of sarah
standing next to a humanoid robot i

11456
03:07:10,950 --> 03:07:10,960
standing next to a humanoid robot i
 

11457
03:07:10,960 --> 03:07:13,349
standing next to a humanoid robot i
guess you like them with a small head

11458
03:07:13,349 --> 03:07:13,359
guess you like them with a small head
 

11459
03:07:13,359 --> 03:07:16,469
guess you like them with a small head
and perfect vision actually no i just um

11460
03:07:16,469 --> 03:07:16,479
and perfect vision actually no i just um
 

11461
03:07:16,479 --> 03:07:19,510
and perfect vision actually no i just um
i did the perfect there's a lighter

11462
03:07:19,510 --> 03:07:19,520
i did the perfect there's a lighter
 

11463
03:07:19,520 --> 03:07:21,190
i did the perfect there's a lighter
no i mean i think i was just deeply

11464
03:07:21,190 --> 03:07:21,200
no i mean i think i was just deeply
 

11465
03:07:21,200 --> 03:07:23,429
no i mean i think i was just deeply
interested because um what was sorry to

11466
03:07:23,429 --> 03:07:23,439
interested because um what was sorry to
 

11467
03:07:23,439 --> 03:07:25,110
interested because um what was sorry to
interrupt was it manually controlled was

11468
03:07:25,110 --> 03:07:25,120
interrupt was it manually controlled was
 

11469
03:07:25,120 --> 03:07:27,590
interrupt was it manually controlled was
it actually uh stabilizing itself oh no

11470
03:07:27,590 --> 03:07:27,600
it actually uh stabilizing itself oh no
 

11471
03:07:27,600 --> 03:07:31,110
it actually uh stabilizing itself oh no
it was walking around oh nice yeah nice

11472
03:07:31,110 --> 03:07:31,120
it was walking around oh nice yeah nice
 

11473
03:07:31,120 --> 03:07:33,030
it was walking around oh nice yeah nice
it was pretty impressive i mean actually

11474
03:07:33,030 --> 03:07:33,040
it was pretty impressive i mean actually
 

11475
03:07:33,040 --> 03:07:34,950
it was pretty impressive i mean actually
there's some videos online of jeff bezos

11476
03:07:34,950 --> 03:07:34,960
there's some videos online of jeff bezos
 

11477
03:07:34,960 --> 03:07:36,469
there's some videos online of jeff bezos
walking with one of those across the

11478
03:07:36,469 --> 03:07:36,479
walking with one of those across the
 

11479
03:07:36,479 --> 03:07:37,510
walking with one of those across the
lawn

11480

there you go

11498
03:07:50,830 --> 03:07:50,840
there you go
 

11499
03:07:50,840 --> 03:07:54,309
there you go
see that's incredible wasn't it yeah see

11500
03:07:54,309 --> 03:07:54,319
see that's incredible wasn't it yeah see
 

11501
03:07:54,319 --> 03:07:56,389
see that's incredible wasn't it yeah see
you look at the walking robot where did

11502
03:07:56,389 --> 03:07:56,399
you look at the walking robot where did
 

11503
03:07:56,399 --> 03:07:57,830
you look at the walking robot where did
the idea for walking come from was

11504
03:07:57,830 --> 03:07:57,840
the idea for walking come from was
 

11505
03:07:57,840 --> 03:07:59,830
the idea for walking come from was
invented by evolution right

11506
03:07:59,830 --> 03:07:59,840
invented by evolution right
 

11507
03:07:59,840 --> 03:08:01,349
invented by evolution right
and us as human beings able to

11508
03:08:01,349 --> 03:08:01,359
and us as human beings able to
 

11509
03:08:01,359 --> 03:08:03,429
and us as human beings able to
conceptualize and design and engineer so

11510
03:08:03,429 --> 03:08:03,439
conceptualize and design and engineer so
 

11511
03:08:03,439 --> 03:08:05,190
conceptualize and design and engineer so
the calls will change so that robot is

11512
03:08:05,190 --> 03:08:05,200
the calls will change so that robot is
 

11513
03:08:05,200 --> 03:08:06,950
the calls will change so that robot is
evidence of life

11514
03:08:06,950 --> 03:08:06,960
evidence of life
 

11515
03:08:06,960 --> 03:08:08,710
evidence of life
and so i think what's going to happen is

11516
03:08:08,710 --> 03:08:08,720
and so i think what's going to happen is
 

11517
03:08:08,720 --> 03:08:09,830
and so i think what's going to happen is
there's

11518
03:08:09,830 --> 03:08:09,840
there's
 

11519
03:08:09,840 --> 03:08:11,030
there's
the um

11520
03:08:11,030 --> 03:08:11,040
the um
 

11521
03:08:11,040 --> 03:08:13,190
the um
we want to find where the spark comes

11522
03:08:13,190 --> 03:08:13,200
we want to find where the spark comes
 

11523
03:08:13,200 --> 03:08:14,950
we want to find where the spark comes
from mechanistically how can you

11524
03:08:14,950 --> 03:08:14,960
from mechanistically how can you
 

11525
03:08:14,960 --> 03:08:17,590
from mechanistically how can you
literally go from sand to cells

11526
03:08:17,590 --> 03:08:17,600
literally go from sand to cells
 

11527
03:08:17,600 --> 03:08:19,429
literally go from sand to cells
so that's the first transition i think

11528
03:08:19,429 --> 03:08:19,439
so that's the first transition i think
 

11529
03:08:19,439 --> 03:08:20,550
so that's the first transition i think
you know there are a number of problems

11530
03:08:20,550 --> 03:08:20,560
you know there are a number of problems
 

11531
03:08:20,560 --> 03:08:23,429
you know there are a number of problems
we want to do make life in lab

11532
03:08:23,429 --> 03:08:23,439
we want to do make life in lab
 

11533
03:08:23,439 --> 03:08:25,510
we want to do make life in lab
great then when i make life in lab we

11534
03:08:25,510 --> 03:08:25,520
great then when i make life in lab we
 

11535
03:08:25,520 --> 03:08:26,630
great then when i make life in lab we
want to suddenly start to make

11536
03:08:26,630 --> 03:08:26,640
want to suddenly start to make
 

11537
03:08:26,640 --> 03:08:28,070
want to suddenly start to make
intelligent life

11538
03:08:28,070 --> 03:08:28,080
intelligent life
 

11539
03:08:28,080 --> 03:08:29,830
intelligent life
or life that can solve start to solve

11540
03:08:29,830 --> 03:08:29,840
or life that can solve start to solve
 

11541
03:08:29,840 --> 03:08:31,269
or life that can solve start to solve
abstract problems

11542
03:08:31,269 --> 03:08:31,279
abstract problems
 

11543
03:08:31,279 --> 03:08:33,110
abstract problems
and then we want to make life

11544
03:08:33,110 --> 03:08:33,120
and then we want to make life
 

11545
03:08:33,120 --> 03:08:35,110
and then we want to make life
that is conscious

11546
03:08:35,110 --> 03:08:35,120
that is conscious
 

11547
03:08:35,120 --> 03:08:37,510
that is conscious
okay in that order i think it has to

11548
03:08:37,510 --> 03:08:37,520
okay in that order i think it has to
 

11549
03:08:37,520 --> 03:08:39,510
okay in that order i think it has to
happen that order you know this getting

11550
03:08:39,510 --> 03:08:39,520
happen that order you know this getting
 

11551
03:08:39,520 --> 03:08:40,950
happen that order you know this getting
towards this artificial general

11552
03:08:40,950 --> 03:08:40,960
towards this artificial general
 

11553
03:08:40,960 --> 03:08:42,630
towards this artificial general
intelligence i think that artificial

11554
03:08:42,630 --> 03:08:42,640
intelligence i think that artificial
 

11555
03:08:42,640 --> 03:08:44,150
intelligence i think that artificial
general intelligence

11556
03:08:44,150 --> 03:08:44,160
general intelligence
 

11557
03:08:44,160 --> 03:08:46,309
general intelligence
can't exist in a vacuum it has to have a

11558
03:08:46,309 --> 03:08:46,319
can't exist in a vacuum it has to have a
 

11559
03:08:46,319 --> 03:08:48,150
can't exist in a vacuum it has to have a
causal change all the way back to luca

11560
03:08:48,150 --> 03:08:48,160
causal change all the way back to luca
 

11561
03:08:48,160 --> 03:08:50,870
causal change all the way back to luca
right yeah and so the question i think i

11562
03:08:50,870 --> 03:08:50,880
right yeah and so the question i think i
 

11563
03:08:50,880 --> 03:08:53,269
right yeah and so the question i think i
really like the question is to say

11564
03:08:53,269 --> 03:08:53,279
really like the question is to say
 

11565
03:08:53,279 --> 03:08:55,830
really like the question is to say
what are we how is

11566
03:08:55,830 --> 03:08:55,840
what are we how is
 

11567
03:08:55,840 --> 03:08:56,790
what are we how is
how

11568
03:08:56,790 --> 03:08:56,800
how
 

11569
03:08:56,800 --> 03:08:58,630
how
is our pursuit of more and more life

11570
03:08:58,630 --> 03:08:58,640
is our pursuit of more and more life
 

11571
03:08:58,640 --> 03:09:00,389
is our pursuit of more and more life
like i know you want to you like your

11572
03:09:00,389 --> 03:09:00,399
like i know you want to you like your
 

11573
03:09:00,399 --> 03:09:01,990
like i know you want to you like your
robots you want to project into them you

11574
03:09:01,990 --> 03:09:02,000
robots you want to project into them you
 

11575
03:09:02,000 --> 03:09:03,750
robots you want to project into them you
want to interact with them you you i

11576
03:09:03,750 --> 03:09:03,760
want to interact with them you you i
 

11577
03:09:03,760 --> 03:09:06,150
want to interact with them you you i
think you would want if you have a robot

11578
03:09:06,150 --> 03:09:06,160
think you would want if you have a robot
 

11579
03:09:06,160 --> 03:09:07,510
think you would want if you have a robot
dog and a robot dog does everything

11580
03:09:07,510 --> 03:09:07,520
dog and a robot dog does everything
 

11581
03:09:07,520 --> 03:09:08,630
dog and a robot dog does everything
expect of a normal dog and you can't

11582
03:09:08,630 --> 03:09:08,640
expect of a normal dog and you can't
 

11583
03:09:08,640 --> 03:09:09,910
expect of a normal dog and you can't
tell a difference

11584
03:09:09,910 --> 03:09:09,920
tell a difference
 

11585
03:09:09,920 --> 03:09:10,870
tell a difference
you're not really going to ask the

11586
03:09:10,870 --> 03:09:10,880
you're not really going to ask the
 

11587
03:09:10,880 --> 03:09:12,630
you're not really going to ask the
question anymore if it's a real dog or

11588
03:09:12,630 --> 03:09:12,640
question anymore if it's a real dog or
 

11589
03:09:12,640 --> 03:09:14,389
question anymore if it's a real dog or
not or you've got a personality you're

11590
03:09:14,389 --> 03:09:14,399
not or you've got a personality you're
 

11591
03:09:14,399 --> 03:09:16,550
not or you've got a personality you're
interacting with it and so i think what

11592
03:09:16,550 --> 03:09:16,560
interacting with it and so i think what
 

11593
03:09:16,560 --> 03:09:19,590
interacting with it and so i think what
would be interesting would be to kind of

11594
03:09:19,590 --> 03:09:19,600
would be interesting would be to kind of
 

11595
03:09:19,600 --> 03:09:21,190
would be interesting would be to kind of
understand the computational

11596
03:09:21,190 --> 03:09:21,200
understand the computational
 

11597
03:09:21,200 --> 03:09:22,550
understand the computational
architecture how that evolves because

11598
03:09:22,550 --> 03:09:22,560
architecture how that evolves because
 

11599
03:09:22,560 --> 03:09:24,469
architecture how that evolves because
you could then you know teleport the

11600
03:09:24,469 --> 03:09:24,479
you could then you know teleport the
 

11601
03:09:24,479 --> 03:09:26,389
you could then you know teleport the
personality from one object to the other

11602
03:09:26,389 --> 03:09:26,399
personality from one object to the other
 

11603
03:09:26,399 --> 03:09:29,349
personality from one object to the other
and say right does it act the same

11604
03:09:29,349 --> 03:09:29,359
and say right does it act the same
 

11605
03:09:29,359 --> 03:09:31,349
and say right does it act the same
and i think that as we go along we're

11606
03:09:31,349 --> 03:09:31,359
and i think that as we go along we're
 

11607
03:09:31,359 --> 03:09:34,070
and i think that as we go along we're
going to get better and better at

11608
03:09:34,070 --> 03:09:34,080
going to get better and better at
 

11609
03:09:34,080 --> 03:09:37,030
going to get better and better at
integrating our consciousness into

11610
03:09:37,030 --> 03:09:37,040
integrating our consciousness into
 

11611
03:09:37,040 --> 03:09:38,870
integrating our consciousness into
machines well let me ask you that

11612
03:09:38,870 --> 03:09:38,880
machines well let me ask you that
 

11613
03:09:38,880 --> 03:09:40,309
machines well let me ask you that
question just so

11614
03:09:40,309 --> 03:09:40,319
question just so
 

11615
03:09:40,319 --> 03:09:42,309
question just so
to link on it

11616
03:09:42,309 --> 03:09:42,319
to link on it
 

11617
03:09:42,319 --> 03:09:44,550
to link on it
i would i would call that a living

11618
03:09:44,550 --> 03:09:44,560
i would i would call that a living
 

11619
03:09:44,560 --> 03:09:47,670
i would i would call that a living
conscious thing potentially eyes as a

11620
03:09:47,670 --> 03:09:47,680
conscious thing potentially eyes as a
 

11621
03:09:47,680 --> 03:09:50,469
conscious thing potentially eyes as a
human allegedly but your would you

11622
03:09:50,469 --> 03:09:50,479
human allegedly but your would you
 

11623
03:09:50,479 --> 03:09:53,590
human allegedly but your would you
as a person trying to define life

11624
03:09:53,590 --> 03:09:53,600
as a person trying to define life
 

11625
03:09:53,600 --> 03:09:55,590
as a person trying to define life
if you passed the turing test are you a

11626
03:09:55,590 --> 03:09:55,600
if you passed the turing test are you a
 

11627
03:09:55,600 --> 03:09:56,790
if you passed the turing test are you a
life form

11628
03:09:56,790 --> 03:09:56,800
life form
 

11629
03:09:56,800 --> 03:09:57,990
life form
one of the reasons i walked up to the

11630
03:09:57,990 --> 03:09:58,000
one of the reasons i walked up to the
 

11631
03:09:58,000 --> 03:09:59,830
one of the reasons i walked up to the
robot was um

11632
03:09:59,830 --> 03:09:59,840
robot was um
 

11633
03:09:59,840 --> 03:10:02,469
robot was um
because i wanted to meet the robot right

11634
03:10:02,469 --> 03:10:02,479
because i wanted to meet the robot right
 

11635
03:10:02,479 --> 03:10:03,830
because i wanted to meet the robot right
right so

11636
03:10:03,830 --> 03:10:03,840
right so
 

11637
03:10:03,840 --> 03:10:04,950
right so
i

11638
03:10:04,950 --> 03:10:04,960
i
 

11639
03:10:04,960 --> 03:10:07,030
i
it felt like i was

11640
03:10:07,030 --> 03:10:07,040
it felt like i was
 

11641
03:10:07,040 --> 03:10:08,150
it felt like i was
and i i

11642
03:10:08,150 --> 03:10:08,160
and i i
 

11643
03:10:08,160 --> 03:10:09,670
and i i
i base a lot of my interaction with

11644
03:10:09,670 --> 03:10:09,680
i base a lot of my interaction with
 

11645
03:10:09,680 --> 03:10:11,990
i base a lot of my interaction with
reality on emotion and feeling but like

11646
03:10:11,990 --> 03:10:12,000
reality on emotion and feeling but like
 

11647
03:10:12,000 --> 03:10:13,190
reality on emotion and feeling but like
like how do you feel about an

11648
03:10:13,190 --> 03:10:13,200
like how do you feel about an
 

11649
03:10:13,200 --> 03:10:14,389
like how do you feel about an
interaction and i always love your point

11650
03:10:14,389 --> 03:10:14,399
interaction and i always love your point
 

11651
03:10:14,399 --> 03:10:15,750
interaction and i always love your point
about like is it enough to have that

11652
03:10:15,750 --> 03:10:15,760
about like is it enough to have that
 

11653
03:10:15,760 --> 03:10:17,990
about like is it enough to have that
shared experience with a robot right so

11654
03:10:17,990 --> 03:10:18,000
shared experience with a robot right so
 

11655
03:10:18,000 --> 03:10:19,590
shared experience with a robot right so
so walking up to it does it feel like

11656
03:10:19,590 --> 03:10:19,600
so walking up to it does it feel like
 

11657
03:10:19,600 --> 03:10:20,870
so walking up to it does it feel like
you're interacting with a living thing

11658
03:10:20,870 --> 03:10:20,880
you're interacting with a living thing
 

11659
03:10:20,880 --> 03:10:23,510
you're interacting with a living thing
and it did to an extent but in some

11660
03:10:23,510 --> 03:10:23,520
and it did to an extent but in some
 

11661
03:10:23,520 --> 03:10:25,269
and it did to an extent but in some
degrees it feels like you're interacting

11662
03:10:25,269 --> 03:10:25,279
degrees it feels like you're interacting
 

11663
03:10:25,279 --> 03:10:27,990
degrees it feels like you're interacting
with a baby living thing so i think our

11664
03:10:27,990 --> 03:10:28,000
with a baby living thing so i think our
 

11665
03:10:28,000 --> 03:10:29,269
with a baby living thing so i think our
relationship with technology in

11666
03:10:29,269 --> 03:10:29,279
relationship with technology in
 

11667
03:10:29,279 --> 03:10:30,870
relationship with technology in
particular robots we build is really

11668
03:10:30,870 --> 03:10:30,880
particular robots we build is really
 

11669
03:10:30,880 --> 03:10:32,309
particular robots we build is really
interesting because

11670
03:10:32,309 --> 03:10:32,319
interesting because
 

11671
03:10:32,319 --> 03:10:33,750
interesting because
um basically

11672
03:10:33,750 --> 03:10:33,760
um basically
 

11673
03:10:33,760 --> 03:10:35,429
um basically
they exist as objects in our future in

11674
03:10:35,429 --> 03:10:35,439
they exist as objects in our future in
 

11675
03:10:35,439 --> 03:10:37,110
they exist as objects in our future in
some sense like we're a much older

11676
03:10:37,110 --> 03:10:37,120
some sense like we're a much older
 

11677
03:10:37,120 --> 03:10:38,790
some sense like we're a much older
evolutionary lineage

11678
03:10:38,790 --> 03:10:38,800
evolutionary lineage
 

11679
03:10:38,800 --> 03:10:40,710
evolutionary lineage
than robots are but we're all part of

11680
03:10:40,710 --> 03:10:40,720
than robots are but we're all part of
 

11681
03:10:40,720 --> 03:10:42,229
than robots are but we're all part of
the same causal chain

11682
03:10:42,229 --> 03:10:42,239
the same causal chain
 

11683
03:10:42,239 --> 03:10:43,990
the same causal chain
and presumably

11684
03:10:43,990 --> 03:10:44,000
and presumably
 

11685
03:10:44,000 --> 03:10:45,269
and presumably
you know they're

11686
03:10:45,269 --> 03:10:45,279
you know they're
 

11687
03:10:45,279 --> 03:10:47,750
you know they're
kind of in in their infancy so it's

11688
03:10:47,750 --> 03:10:47,760
kind of in in their infancy so it's
 

11689
03:10:47,760 --> 03:10:49,030
kind of in in their infancy so it's
almost like you're looking at the future

11690
03:10:49,030 --> 03:10:49,040
almost like you're looking at the future
 

11691
03:10:49,040 --> 03:10:50,790
almost like you're looking at the future
of life when you're looking at them but

11692
03:10:50,790 --> 03:10:50,800
of life when you're looking at them but
 

11693
03:10:50,800 --> 03:10:54,469
of life when you're looking at them but
it hasn't really become life in in

11694
03:10:54,469 --> 03:10:54,479
it hasn't really become life in in
 

11695
03:10:54,479 --> 03:10:56,469
it hasn't really become life in in
in a full manifestation of whatever it

11696
03:10:56,469 --> 03:10:56,479
in a full manifestation of whatever it
 

11697
03:10:56,479 --> 03:10:58,469
in a full manifestation of whatever it
is that they're gonna become

11698
03:10:58,469 --> 03:10:58,479
is that they're gonna become
 

11699
03:10:58,479 --> 03:10:59,590
is that they're gonna become
um

11700
03:10:59,590 --> 03:10:59,600
um
 

11701
03:10:59,600 --> 03:11:02,790
um
and you know the the more uh the example

11702
03:11:02,790 --> 03:11:02,800
and you know the the more uh the example
 

11703
03:11:02,800 --> 03:11:04,070
and you know the the more uh the example
the walking robot was super interesting

11704
03:11:04,070 --> 03:11:04,080
the walking robot was super interesting
 

11705
03:11:04,080 --> 03:11:06,070
the walking robot was super interesting
but they also had a dolphin that they

11706
03:11:06,070 --> 03:11:06,080
but they also had a dolphin that they
 

11707
03:11:06,080 --> 03:11:07,910
but they also had a dolphin that they
put in the pool at the cocktail party at

11708
03:11:07,910 --> 03:11:07,920
put in the pool at the cocktail party at
 

11709
03:11:07,920 --> 03:11:09,510
put in the pool at the cocktail party at
mars and it looked just like a real

11710
03:11:09,510 --> 03:11:09,520
mars and it looked just like a real
 

11711
03:11:09,520 --> 03:11:11,269
mars and it looked just like a real
dolphin swimming in the pool

11712
03:11:11,269 --> 03:11:11,279
dolphin swimming in the pool
 

11713
03:11:11,279 --> 03:11:12,630
dolphin swimming in the pool
and um

11714
03:11:12,630 --> 03:11:12,640
and um
 

11715
03:11:12,640 --> 03:11:13,750
and um
and you know it's in this kind of

11716
03:11:13,750 --> 03:11:13,760
and you know it's in this kind of
 

11717
03:11:13,760 --> 03:11:16,070
and you know it's in this kind of
uncanny valley because and i was having

11718
03:11:16,070 --> 03:11:16,080
uncanny valley because and i was having
 

11719
03:11:16,080 --> 03:11:18,389
uncanny valley because and i was having
this conversation um

11720
03:11:18,389 --> 03:11:18,399
this conversation um
 

11721
03:11:18,399 --> 03:11:20,469
this conversation um
with a gentleman mutu who was super

11722
03:11:20,469 --> 03:11:20,479
with a gentleman mutu who was super
 

11723
03:11:20,479 --> 03:11:22,150
with a gentleman mutu who was super
perceptive but he was basically saying

11724
03:11:22,150 --> 03:11:22,160
perceptive but he was basically saying
 

11725
03:11:22,160 --> 03:11:23,349
perceptive but he was basically saying
like it made him feel really

11726
03:11:23,349 --> 03:11:23,359
like it made him feel really
 

11727
03:11:23,359 --> 03:11:24,790
like it made him feel really
uncomfortable

11728
03:11:24,790 --> 03:11:24,800
uncomfortable
 

11729
03:11:24,800 --> 03:11:25,670
uncomfortable
um

11730
03:11:25,670 --> 03:11:25,680
um
 

11731
03:11:25,680 --> 03:11:27,269
um
and i think often

11732
03:11:27,269 --> 03:11:27,279
and i think often
 

11733
03:11:27,279 --> 03:11:28,469
and i think often
yeah and i think a lot of people would

11734
03:11:28,469 --> 03:11:28,479
yeah and i think a lot of people would
 

11735
03:11:28,479 --> 03:11:30,710
yeah and i think a lot of people would
have that response and i guess my point

11736
03:11:30,710 --> 03:11:30,720
have that response and i guess my point
 

11737
03:11:30,720 --> 03:11:32,630
have that response and i guess my point
about it is it is kind of interesting

11738
03:11:32,630 --> 03:11:32,640
about it is it is kind of interesting
 

11739
03:11:32,640 --> 03:11:34,229
about it is it is kind of interesting
because you're basically trying to make

11740
03:11:34,229 --> 03:11:34,239
because you're basically trying to make
 

11741
03:11:34,239 --> 03:11:36,950
because you're basically trying to make
a thing that you think is non-living

11742
03:11:36,950 --> 03:11:36,960
a thing that you think is non-living
 

11743
03:11:36,960 --> 03:11:39,190
a thing that you think is non-living
mimic a living thing and so so the

11744
03:11:39,190 --> 03:11:39,200
mimic a living thing and so so the
 

11745
03:11:39,200 --> 03:11:40,309
mimic a living thing and so so the
thought experiment i would want to run

11746
03:11:40,309 --> 03:11:40,319
thought experiment i would want to run
 

11747
03:11:40,319 --> 03:11:42,790
thought experiment i would want to run
in that case is imagine we replaced

11748
03:11:42,790 --> 03:11:42,800
in that case is imagine we replaced
 

11749
03:11:42,800 --> 03:11:44,790
in that case is imagine we replaced
every living thing on earth with a robot

11750
03:11:44,790 --> 03:11:44,800
every living thing on earth with a robot
 

11751
03:11:44,800 --> 03:11:46,630
every living thing on earth with a robot
equivalent like all the dolphins

11752
03:11:46,630 --> 03:11:46,640
equivalent like all the dolphins
 

11753
03:11:46,640 --> 03:11:48,070
equivalent like all the dolphins
and things and in some sense then you're

11754
03:11:48,070 --> 03:11:48,080
and things and in some sense then you're
 

11755
03:11:48,080 --> 03:11:50,070
and things and in some sense then you're
making if you think that the robots

11756
03:11:50,070 --> 03:11:50,080
making if you think that the robots
 

11757
03:11:50,080 --> 03:11:51,990
making if you think that the robots
aren't experiencing reality for example

11758
03:11:51,990 --> 03:11:52,000
aren't experiencing reality for example
 

11759
03:11:52,000 --> 03:11:53,990
aren't experiencing reality for example
the way that a biologically evolved

11760
03:11:53,990 --> 03:11:54,000
the way that a biologically evolved
 

11761
03:11:54,000 --> 03:11:56,950
the way that a biologically evolved
thing would you're basically making the

11762
03:11:56,950 --> 03:11:56,960
thing would you're basically making the
 

11763
03:11:56,960 --> 03:11:58,950
thing would you're basically making the
philosophical zombie argument become

11764
03:11:58,950 --> 03:11:58,960
philosophical zombie argument become
 

11765
03:11:58,960 --> 03:11:59,830
philosophical zombie argument become
real

11766
03:11:59,830 --> 03:11:59,840
real
 

11767
03:11:59,840 --> 03:12:02,469
real
yeah and and basically building reality

11768
03:12:02,469 --> 03:12:02,479
yeah and and basically building reality
 

11769
03:12:02,479 --> 03:12:04,309
yeah and and basically building reality
into a simulation because you've made

11770
03:12:04,309 --> 03:12:04,319
into a simulation because you've made
 

11771
03:12:04,319 --> 03:12:05,349
into a simulation because you've made
everything

11772
03:12:05,349 --> 03:12:05,359
everything
 

11773
03:12:05,359 --> 03:12:07,349
everything
quote unquote fake in some sense you've

11774
03:12:07,349 --> 03:12:07,359
quote unquote fake in some sense you've
 

11775
03:12:07,359 --> 03:12:08,950
quote unquote fake in some sense you've
replaced everything with an emu a

11776
03:12:08,950 --> 03:12:08,960
replaced everything with an emu a
 

11777
03:12:08,960 --> 03:12:11,750
replaced everything with an emu a
physical simulation of it so as opposed

11778
03:12:11,750 --> 03:12:11,760
physical simulation of it so as opposed
 

11779
03:12:11,760 --> 03:12:14,389
physical simulation of it so as opposed
to being excited by the

11780
03:12:14,389 --> 03:12:14,399
to being excited by the
 

11781
03:12:14,399 --> 03:12:16,710
to being excited by the
possibility of creating

11782
03:12:16,710 --> 03:12:16,720
possibility of creating
 

11783
03:12:16,720 --> 03:12:18,790
possibility of creating
something new you're

11784
03:12:18,790 --> 03:12:18,800
something new you're
 

11785
03:12:18,800 --> 03:12:21,510
something new you're
um terrified of being humans being

11786
03:12:21,510 --> 03:12:21,520
um terrified of being humans being
 

11787
03:12:21,520 --> 03:12:23,190
um terrified of being humans being
replaced i was just trying to run like

11788
03:12:23,190 --> 03:12:23,200
replaced i was just trying to run like
 

11789
03:12:23,200 --> 03:12:24,870
replaced i was just trying to run like
what would be the absolute

11790
03:12:24,870 --> 03:12:24,880
what would be the absolute
 

11791
03:12:24,880 --> 03:12:26,630
what would be the absolute
you know thought experiment but i don't

11792
03:12:26,630 --> 03:12:26,640
you know thought experiment but i don't
 

11793
03:12:26,640 --> 03:12:28,469
you know thought experiment but i don't
i don't think that scenario would

11794
03:12:28,469 --> 03:12:28,479
i don't think that scenario would
 

11795
03:12:28,479 --> 03:12:30,790
i don't think that scenario would
actually play out i guess what i i think

11796
03:12:30,790 --> 03:12:30,800
actually play out i guess what i i think
 

11797
03:12:30,800 --> 03:12:32,950
actually play out i guess what i i think
is weird for why we feel this kind of

11798
03:12:32,950 --> 03:12:32,960
is weird for why we feel this kind of
 

11799
03:12:32,960 --> 03:12:34,229
is weird for why we feel this kind of
uncanny valley interacting with

11800
03:12:34,229 --> 03:12:34,239
uncanny valley interacting with
 

11801
03:12:34,239 --> 03:12:36,389
uncanny valley interacting with
something like the robot dolphin is

11802
03:12:36,389 --> 03:12:36,399
something like the robot dolphin is
 

11803
03:12:36,399 --> 03:12:37,910
something like the robot dolphin is
we're looking at an object we know is

11804
03:12:37,910 --> 03:12:37,920
we're looking at an object we know is
 

11805
03:12:37,920 --> 03:12:39,750
we're looking at an object we know is
kind of in the future in the sense of

11806
03:12:39,750 --> 03:12:39,760
kind of in the future in the sense of
 

11807
03:12:39,760 --> 03:12:41,910
kind of in the future in the sense of
like if everything's ordered in time but

11808
03:12:41,910 --> 03:12:41,920
like if everything's ordered in time but
 

11809
03:12:41,920 --> 03:12:43,510
like if everything's ordered in time but
it's borrowing from a structure that we

11810
03:12:43,510 --> 03:12:43,520
it's borrowing from a structure that we
 

11811
03:12:43,520 --> 03:12:45,429
it's borrowing from a structure that we
have common history with and it's

11812
03:12:45,429 --> 03:12:45,439
have common history with and it's
 

11813
03:12:45,439 --> 03:12:47,030
have common history with and it's
basically copying

11814
03:12:47,030 --> 03:12:47,040
basically copying
 

11815
03:12:47,040 --> 03:12:48,790
basically copying
in a kind of superficial way things from

11816
03:12:48,790 --> 03:12:48,800
in a kind of superficial way things from
 

11817
03:12:48,800 --> 03:12:49,670
in a kind of superficial way things from
one

11818
03:12:49,670 --> 03:12:49,680
one
 

11819
03:12:49,680 --> 03:12:51,990
one
part of the causal chain to another

11820
03:12:51,990 --> 03:12:52,000
part of the causal chain to another
 

11821
03:12:52,000 --> 03:12:53,110
part of the causal chain to another
yeah

11822
03:12:53,110 --> 03:12:53,120
yeah
 

11823
03:12:53,120 --> 03:12:55,750
yeah
well that's that's the video

11824
03:12:55,750 --> 03:12:55,760
well that's that's the video
 

11825
03:12:55,760 --> 03:12:57,510
well that's that's the video
every believed it was real

11826
03:12:57,510 --> 03:12:57,520
every believed it was real
 

11827
03:12:57,520 --> 03:12:59,510
every believed it was real
they look so real

11828
03:12:59,510 --> 03:12:59,520
they look so real
 

11829
03:12:59,520 --> 03:13:00,389
they look so real
um

11830
03:13:00,389 --> 03:13:00,399
um
 

11831
03:13:00,399 --> 03:13:02,150
um
and obviously the technology was was

11832
03:13:02,150 --> 03:13:02,160
and obviously the technology was was
 

11833
03:13:02,160 --> 03:13:04,070
and obviously the technology was was
developed for movies so

11834
03:13:04,070 --> 03:13:04,080
developed for movies so
 

11835
03:13:04,080 --> 03:13:05,429
developed for movies so
well i think we're confusing our

11836
03:13:05,429 --> 03:13:05,439
well i think we're confusing our
 

11837
03:13:05,439 --> 03:13:07,349
well i think we're confusing our
emotional response and understanding the

11838
03:13:07,349 --> 03:13:07,359
emotional response and understanding the
 

11839
03:13:07,359 --> 03:13:09,429
emotional response and understanding the
causal chain of how we got there right

11840
03:13:09,429 --> 03:13:09,439
causal chain of how we got there right
 

11841
03:13:09,439 --> 03:13:11,830
causal chain of how we got there right
because a philosophical zombie argument

11842
03:13:11,830 --> 03:13:11,840
because a philosophical zombie argument
 

11843
03:13:11,840 --> 03:13:13,429
because a philosophical zombie argument
thinks about um

11844
03:13:13,429 --> 03:13:13,439
thinks about um
 

11845
03:13:13,439 --> 03:13:15,349
thinks about um
objects just appearing right that you're

11846
03:13:15,349 --> 03:13:15,359
objects just appearing right that you're
 

11847
03:13:15,359 --> 03:13:17,590
objects just appearing right that you're
facsimiled in some way whereas there is

11848
03:13:17,590 --> 03:13:17,600
facsimiled in some way whereas there is
 

11849
03:13:17,600 --> 03:13:19,429
facsimiled in some way whereas there is
that cause what the chain of events that

11850
03:13:19,429 --> 03:13:19,439
that cause what the chain of events that
 

11851
03:13:19,439 --> 03:13:21,429
that cause what the chain of events that
caused the uh dolphin to be built went

11852
03:13:21,429 --> 03:13:21,439
caused the uh dolphin to be built went
 

11853
03:13:21,439 --> 03:13:22,710
caused the uh dolphin to be built went
for a human being yeah would uh

11854
03:13:22,710 --> 03:13:22,720
for a human being yeah would uh
 

11855
03:13:22,720 --> 03:13:24,389
for a human being yeah would uh
philosophical zombies still have a high

11856
03:13:24,389 --> 03:13:24,399
philosophical zombies still have a high
 

11857
03:13:24,399 --> 03:13:26,710
philosophical zombies still have a high
assembly index yeah

11858
03:13:26,710 --> 03:13:26,720
assembly index yeah
 

11859
03:13:26,720 --> 03:13:28,150
assembly index yeah
because it came it can't be

11860
03:13:28,150 --> 03:13:28,160
because it came it can't be
 

11861
03:13:28,160 --> 03:13:30,070
because it came it can't be
philosophical zombies can't like like

11862
03:13:30,070 --> 03:13:30,080
philosophical zombies can't like like
 

11863
03:13:30,080 --> 03:13:31,990
philosophical zombies can't like like
boltzmann brains just can't appear out

11864
03:13:31,990 --> 03:13:32,000
boltzmann brains just can't appear out
 

11865
03:13:32,000 --> 03:13:33,910
boltzmann brains just can't appear out
of nowhere well i guess my question

11866
03:13:33,910 --> 03:13:33,920
of nowhere well i guess my question
 

11867
03:13:33,920 --> 03:13:35,190
of nowhere well i guess my question
would be in that that scenario where you

11868
03:13:35,190 --> 03:13:35,200
would be in that that scenario where you
 

11869
03:13:35,200 --> 03:13:36,229
would be in that that scenario where you
build all the robots and replace

11870
03:13:36,229 --> 03:13:36,239
build all the robots and replace
 

11871
03:13:36,239 --> 03:13:37,510
build all the robots and replace
everything on earth with robots would

11872
03:13:37,510 --> 03:13:37,520
everything on earth with robots would
 

11873
03:13:37,520 --> 03:13:39,269
everything on earth with robots would
the with the biosphere be as creative

11874
03:13:39,269 --> 03:13:39,279
the with the biosphere be as creative
 

11875
03:13:39,279 --> 03:13:41,429
the with the biosphere be as creative
under that scenario or not yeah and so

11876
03:13:41,429 --> 03:13:41,439
under that scenario or not yeah and so
 

11877
03:13:41,439 --> 03:13:42,389
under that scenario or not yeah and so
are there

11878
03:13:42,389 --> 03:13:42,399
are there
 

11879
03:13:42,399 --> 03:13:44,309
are there
are there quantitative differences you

11880
03:13:44,309 --> 03:13:44,319
are there quantitative differences you
 

11881
03:13:44,319 --> 03:13:45,990
are there quantitative differences you
would notice over time and it's not

11882
03:13:45,990 --> 03:13:46,000
would notice over time and it's not
 

11883
03:13:46,000 --> 03:13:47,590
would notice over time and it's not
obvious either way right it's not

11884
03:13:47,590 --> 03:13:47,600
obvious either way right it's not
 

11885
03:13:47,600 --> 03:13:49,030
obvious either way right it's not
obvious right now because we don't

11886
03:13:49,030 --> 03:13:49,040
obvious right now because we don't
 

11887
03:13:49,040 --> 03:13:51,030
obvious right now because we don't
really we don't understand we haven't

11888
03:13:51,030 --> 03:13:51,040
really we don't understand we haven't
 

11889
03:13:51,040 --> 03:13:53,190
really we don't understand we haven't
built into machines how we work so

11890
03:13:53,190 --> 03:13:53,200
built into machines how we work so
 

11891
03:13:53,200 --> 03:13:55,190
built into machines how we work so
that's i think the there are one of the

11892
03:13:55,190 --> 03:13:55,200
that's i think the there are one of the
 

11893
03:13:55,200 --> 03:13:57,750
that's i think the there are one of the
big missing things that i think that

11894
03:13:57,750 --> 03:13:57,760
big missing things that i think that
 

11895
03:13:57,760 --> 03:13:59,910
big missing things that i think that
we're both looking for right it's a cute

11896
03:13:59,910 --> 03:13:59,920
we're both looking for right it's a cute
 

11897
03:13:59,920 --> 03:14:02,229
we're both looking for right it's a cute
robot but but the points there is that

11898
03:14:02,229 --> 03:14:02,239
robot but but the points there is that
 

11899
03:14:02,239 --> 03:14:04,469
robot but but the points there is that
um the biosphere won't be as creative if

11900
03:14:04,469 --> 03:14:04,479
um the biosphere won't be as creative if
 

11901
03:14:04,479 --> 03:14:06,309
um the biosphere won't be as creative if
you did it right now no of course i

11902
03:14:06,309 --> 03:14:06,319
you did it right now no of course i
 

11903
03:14:06,319 --> 03:14:07,670
you did it right now no of course i
think that's why but

11904
03:14:07,670 --> 03:14:07,680
think that's why but
 

11905
03:14:07,680 --> 03:14:09,750
think that's why but
but in the future

11906
03:14:09,750 --> 03:14:09,760
but in the future
 

11907
03:14:09,760 --> 03:14:12,630
but in the future
it we will be able to solve the problem

11908
03:14:12,630 --> 03:14:12,640
it we will be able to solve the problem
 

11909
03:14:12,640 --> 03:14:13,590
it we will be able to solve the problem
of

11910
03:14:13,590 --> 03:14:13,600
of
 

11911
03:14:13,600 --> 03:14:16,389
of
origin of life

11912
03:14:16,389 --> 03:14:16,399
origin of life
 

11913
03:14:16,399 --> 03:14:19,190
origin of life
intelligence and consciousness

11914
03:14:19,190 --> 03:14:19,200
intelligence and consciousness
 

11915
03:14:19,200 --> 03:14:20,389
intelligence and consciousness
because they exist in physical

11916
03:14:20,389 --> 03:14:20,399
because they exist in physical
 

11917
03:14:20,399 --> 03:14:22,150
because they exist in physical
substrates we just don't understand

11918
03:14:22,150 --> 03:14:22,160
substrates we just don't understand
 

11919
03:14:22,160 --> 03:14:24,790
substrates we just don't understand
enough about the material substrate and

11920
03:14:24,790 --> 03:14:24,800
enough about the material substrate and
 

11921
03:14:24,800 --> 03:14:27,349
enough about the material substrate and
the causal chain but i'm very confident

11922
03:14:27,349 --> 03:14:27,359
the causal chain but i'm very confident
 

11923
03:14:27,359 --> 03:14:29,429
the causal chain but i'm very confident
we will get to an agi but it won't be

11924
03:14:29,429 --> 03:14:29,439
we will get to an agi but it won't be
 

11925
03:14:29,439 --> 03:14:31,190
we will get to an agi but it won't be
what people think it won't be solution

11926
03:14:31,190 --> 03:14:31,200
what people think it won't be solution
 

11927
03:14:31,200 --> 03:14:33,990
what people think it won't be solution
won't be a we'll get forward a lot and

11928
03:14:33,990 --> 03:14:34,000
won't be a we'll get forward a lot and
 

11929
03:14:34,000 --> 03:14:36,309
won't be a we'll get forward a lot and
so gpt3 is getting better at falling us

11930
03:14:36,309 --> 03:14:36,319
so gpt3 is getting better at falling us
 

11931
03:14:36,319 --> 03:14:39,110
so gpt3 is getting better at falling us
and gpt 153 might

11932
03:14:39,110 --> 03:14:39,120
and gpt 153 might
 

11933
03:14:39,120 --> 03:14:41,269
and gpt 153 might
really fool us but it won't have the

11934
03:14:41,269 --> 03:14:41,279
really fool us but it won't have the
 

11935
03:14:41,279 --> 03:14:43,269
really fool us but it won't have the
magic we're looking for it won't be a

11936
03:14:43,269 --> 03:14:43,279
magic we're looking for it won't be a
 

11937
03:14:43,279 --> 03:14:44,950
magic we're looking for it won't be a
creative

11938
03:14:44,950 --> 03:14:44,960
creative
 

11939
03:14:44,960 --> 03:14:46,870
creative
but it will help us understand the

11940
03:14:46,870 --> 03:14:46,880
but it will help us understand the
 

11941
03:14:46,880 --> 03:14:49,349
but it will help us understand the
differences between really though

11942
03:14:49,349 --> 03:14:49,359
differences between really though
 

11943
03:14:49,359 --> 03:14:50,550
differences between really though
because

11944
03:14:50,550 --> 03:14:50,560
because
 

11945
03:14:50,560 --> 03:14:54,710
because
isn't that what love is being fooled

11946
03:14:54,710 --> 03:14:54,720
isn't that what love is being fooled
 

11947
03:14:54,720 --> 03:14:56,710
isn't that what love is being fooled
like what why why are you not giving

11948
03:14:56,710 --> 03:14:56,720
like what why why are you not giving
 

11949
03:14:56,720 --> 03:14:58,950
like what why why are you not giving
much value to the emotional connection

11950
03:14:58,950 --> 03:14:58,960
much value to the emotional connection
 

11951
03:14:58,960 --> 03:15:01,269
much value to the emotional connection
with objects with with robots with

11952
03:15:01,269 --> 03:15:01,279
with objects with with robots with
 

11953
03:15:01,279 --> 03:15:03,110
with objects with with robots with
humans emotion is that thing which

11954
03:15:03,110 --> 03:15:03,120
humans emotion is that thing which
 

11955
03:15:03,120 --> 03:15:05,110
humans emotion is that thing which
happens when you're when you're

11956
03:15:05,110 --> 03:15:05,120
happens when you're when you're
 

11957
03:15:05,120 --> 03:15:06,389
happens when you're when you're
the uh

11958
03:15:06,389 --> 03:15:06,399
the uh
 

11959
03:15:06,399 --> 03:15:08,710
the uh
the fun your expectation function is is

11960
03:15:08,710 --> 03:15:08,720
the fun your expectation function is is
 

11961
03:15:08,720 --> 03:15:11,510
the fun your expectation function is is
dashed and something else happens right

11962
03:15:11,510 --> 03:15:11,520
dashed and something else happens right
 

11963
03:15:11,520 --> 03:15:13,510
dashed and something else happens right
i mean that's what emotion is is that

11964
03:15:13,510 --> 03:15:13,520
i mean that's what emotion is is that
 

11965
03:15:13,520 --> 03:15:15,750
i mean that's what emotion is is that
what love is too yeah

11966
03:15:15,750 --> 03:15:15,760
what love is too yeah
 

11967
03:15:15,760 --> 03:15:17,429
what love is too yeah
you were expecting one thing and

11968
03:15:17,429 --> 03:15:17,439
you were expecting one thing and
 

11969
03:15:17,439 --> 03:15:19,510
you were expecting one thing and
something else happened yeah i don't

11976
03:15:25,110 --> 03:15:25,120
look i'm i'm sorry emotion is that but
 

11977
03:15:25,120 --> 03:15:27,110
look i'm i'm sorry emotion is that but

define love quickly okay go for it in
 

11995
03:15:40,000 --> 03:15:42,070
define love quickly okay go for it in
terms of assembly space right okay

11996
03:15:42,070 --> 03:15:42,080
terms of assembly space right okay
 

11997
03:15:42,080 --> 03:15:44,229
terms of assembly space right okay
excellent i didn't think i'd be doing

11998
03:15:44,229 --> 03:15:44,239
excellent i didn't think i'd be doing
 

11999
03:15:44,239 --> 03:15:46,309
excellent i didn't think i'd be doing
this today okay wait until assembly

12000
03:15:46,309 --> 03:15:46,319
this today okay wait until assembly
 

12001
03:15:46,319 --> 03:15:48,150
this today okay wait until assembly
theory 101 is taught and the second

12002
03:15:48,150 --> 03:15:48,160
theory 101 is taught and the second
 

12003
03:15:48,160 --> 03:15:50,469
theory 101 is taught and the second
lecture is assembly theory of love

12004
03:15:50,469 --> 03:15:50,479
lecture is assembly theory of love
 

12005
03:15:50,479 --> 03:15:53,510
lecture is assembly theory of love
but actually but look but

12006
03:15:53,510 --> 03:15:53,520
but actually but look but
 

12007
03:15:53,520 --> 03:15:55,269
but actually but look but
it's being surprised the expectation is

12008
03:15:55,269 --> 03:15:55,279
it's being surprised the expectation is
 

12009
03:15:55,279 --> 03:15:57,269
it's being surprised the expectation is
being broken i'm just i'm not no go for

12010
03:15:57,269 --> 03:15:57,279
being broken i'm just i'm not no go for
 

12011
03:15:57,279 --> 03:15:58,630
being broken i'm just i'm not no go for
it i don't know i want to hear you i'm

12012
03:15:58,630 --> 03:15:58,640
it i don't know i want to hear you i'm
 

12013
03:15:58,640 --> 03:16:00,710
it i don't know i want to hear you i'm
not an emotional being but i would say

12014
03:16:00,710 --> 03:16:00,720
not an emotional being but i would say
 

12015
03:16:00,720 --> 03:16:02,229
not an emotional being but i would say
so let's talk so we'll talk about

12016
03:16:02,229 --> 03:16:02,239
so let's talk so we'll talk about
 

12017
03:16:02,239 --> 03:16:04,150
so let's talk so we'll talk about
emotion but love is more complex is love

12018
03:16:04,150 --> 03:16:04,160
emotion but love is more complex is love
 

12019
03:16:04,160 --> 03:16:05,910
emotion but love is more complex is love
is a very complex set of emotions

12020
03:16:05,910 --> 03:16:05,920
is a very complex set of emotions
 

12021
03:16:05,920 --> 03:16:07,990
is a very complex set of emotions
together and logical stuff but if you've

12022
03:16:07,990 --> 03:16:08,000
together and logical stuff but if you've
 

12023
03:16:08,000 --> 03:16:09,110
together and logical stuff but if you've
got this

12024
03:16:09,110 --> 03:16:09,120
got this
 

12025
03:16:09,120 --> 03:16:10,710
got this
thing this person that's on this causal

12026
03:16:10,710 --> 03:16:10,720
thing this person that's on this causal
 

12027
03:16:10,720 --> 03:16:13,510
thing this person that's on this causal
chain that has this empathy for this

12028
03:16:13,510 --> 03:16:13,520
chain that has this empathy for this
 

12029
03:16:13,520 --> 03:16:14,790
chain that has this empathy for this
other thing

12030
03:16:14,790 --> 03:16:14,800
other thing
 

12031
03:16:14,800 --> 03:16:16,389
other thing
love is being able to project ahead in

12032
03:16:16,389 --> 03:16:16,399
love is being able to project ahead in
 

12033
03:16:16,399 --> 03:16:18,150
love is being able to project ahead in
your assembly space

12034
03:16:18,150 --> 03:16:18,160
your assembly space
 

12035
03:16:18,160 --> 03:16:20,309
your assembly space
and work out what you're the person

12036
03:16:20,309 --> 03:16:20,319
and work out what you're the person
 

12037
03:16:20,319 --> 03:16:22,469
and work out what you're the person
you're in love with has a need for

12038
03:16:22,469 --> 03:16:22,479
you're in love with has a need for
 

12039
03:16:22,479 --> 03:16:24,790
you're in love with has a need for
and to do that for them without

12040
03:16:24,790 --> 03:16:24,800
and to do that for them without
 

12041
03:16:24,800 --> 03:16:26,150
and to do that for them without
selflessly

12042
03:16:26,150 --> 03:16:26,160
selflessly
 

12043
03:16:26,160 --> 03:16:27,510
selflessly
right because you can project ahead what

12044
03:16:27,510 --> 03:16:27,520
right because you can project ahead what
 

12045
03:16:27,520 --> 03:16:28,710
right because you can project ahead what
they're going to need and they are there

12046
03:16:28,710 --> 03:16:28,720
they're going to need and they are there
 

12047
03:16:28,720 --> 03:16:29,349
they're going to need and they are there
and

12048
03:16:29,349 --> 03:16:29,359
and
 

12049
03:16:29,359 --> 03:16:30,469
and
maybe you can see someone is going to

12050
03:16:30,469 --> 03:16:30,479
maybe you can see someone is going to
 

12051
03:16:30,479 --> 03:16:32,469
maybe you can see someone is going to
fall over and you catch them before they

12052
03:16:32,469 --> 03:16:32,479
fall over and you catch them before they
 

12053
03:16:32,479 --> 03:16:34,070
fall over and you catch them before they
fall over or maybe you can anticipate

12054
03:16:34,070 --> 03:16:34,080
fall over or maybe you can anticipate
 

12055
03:16:34,080 --> 03:16:35,910
fall over or maybe you can anticipate
that someone's going to be hungry and

12056
03:16:35,910 --> 03:16:35,920
that someone's going to be hungry and
 

12057
03:16:35,920 --> 03:16:37,910
that someone's going to be hungry and
without helping you you just help them

12058
03:16:37,910 --> 03:16:37,920
without helping you you just help them
 

12059
03:16:37,920 --> 03:16:40,070
without helping you you just help them
that's what that sounds like empathy

12060
03:16:40,070 --> 03:16:40,080
that's what that sounds like empathy
 

12061
03:16:40,080 --> 03:16:41,910
that's what that sounds like empathy
but it's more complex than that right

12062
03:16:41,910 --> 03:16:41,920
but it's more complex than that right
 

12063
03:16:41,920 --> 03:16:43,830
but it's more complex than that right
it's more complex it's more about not

12064
03:16:43,830 --> 03:16:43,840
it's more complex it's more about not
 

12065
03:16:43,840 --> 03:16:46,150
it's more complex it's more about not
just empathy it's understanding it's

12066
03:16:46,150 --> 03:16:46,160
just empathy it's understanding it's
 

12067
03:16:46,160 --> 03:16:48,309
just empathy it's understanding it's
about kind of sharing that experience

12068
03:16:48,309 --> 03:16:48,319
about kind of sharing that experience
 

12069
03:16:48,319 --> 03:16:49,590
about kind of sharing that experience
it's an expression of love though that's

12070
03:16:49,590 --> 03:16:49,600
it's an expression of love though that's
 

12071
03:16:49,600 --> 03:16:51,349
it's an expression of love though that's
not what it's like to feel love like

12072
03:16:51,349 --> 03:16:51,359
not what it's like to feel love like
 

12073
03:16:51,359 --> 03:16:53,030
not what it's like to feel love like
feeling love is like

12074
03:16:53,030 --> 03:16:53,040
feeling love is like
 

12075
03:16:53,040 --> 03:16:54,870
feeling love is like
i like i think it's like when you're

12076
03:16:54,870 --> 03:16:54,880
i like i think it's like when you're
 

12077
03:16:54,880 --> 03:16:57,670
i like i think it's like when you're
aligned with things that you feel like

12078
03:16:57,670 --> 03:16:57,680
aligned with things that you feel like
 

12079
03:16:57,680 --> 03:16:59,269
aligned with things that you feel like
are your purpose or your reason for

12080
03:16:59,269 --> 03:16:59,279
are your purpose or your reason for
 

12081
03:16:59,279 --> 03:17:00,389
are your purpose or your reason for
existing

12082
03:17:00,389 --> 03:17:00,399
existing
 

12083
03:17:00,399 --> 03:17:02,790
existing
so if you have those feelings

12084
03:17:02,790 --> 03:17:02,800
so if you have those feelings
 

12085
03:17:02,800 --> 03:17:05,269
so if you have those feelings
uh towards the robot

12086
03:17:05,269 --> 03:17:05,279
uh towards the robot
 

12087
03:17:05,279 --> 03:17:07,429
uh towards the robot
why is that rope i mean

12088
03:17:07,429 --> 03:17:07,439
why is that rope i mean
 

12089
03:17:07,439 --> 03:17:09,510
why is that rope i mean
because you said like the aj will build

12090
03:17:09,510 --> 03:17:09,520
because you said like the aj will build
 

12091
03:17:09,520 --> 03:17:11,349
because you said like the aj will build
an agi but it won't there'll be a

12092
03:17:11,349 --> 03:17:11,359
an agi but it won't there'll be a
 

12093
03:17:11,359 --> 03:17:12,710
an agi but it won't there'll be a
fundamental difference between aging

12094
03:17:12,710 --> 03:17:12,720
fundamental difference between aging
 

12095
03:17:12,720 --> 03:17:13,830
fundamental difference between aging
right we'll build it it's going to

12096
03:17:13,830 --> 03:17:13,840
right we'll build it it's going to
 

12097
03:17:13,840 --> 03:17:15,269
right we'll build it it's going to
emerge from our technology so i think

12098
03:17:15,269 --> 03:17:15,279
emerge from our technology so i think
 

12099
03:17:15,279 --> 03:17:17,030
emerge from our technology so i think
you guys all are doing the same thing i

12100
03:17:17,030 --> 03:17:17,040
you guys all are doing the same thing i
 

12101
03:17:17,040 --> 03:17:19,830
you guys all are doing the same thing i
just said that gpt that we do not

12102
03:17:19,830 --> 03:17:19,840
just said that gpt that we do not
 

12103
03:17:19,840 --> 03:17:22,469
just said that gpt that we do not
correctly capture the causal chain that

12104
03:17:22,469 --> 03:17:22,479
correctly capture the causal chain that
 

12105
03:17:22,479 --> 03:17:24,550
correctly capture the causal chain that
we have within gpg

12106
03:17:24,550 --> 03:17:24,560
we have within gpg
 

12107
03:17:24,560 --> 03:17:25,429
we have within gpg
yeah

12108
03:17:25,429 --> 03:17:25,439
yeah
 

12109
03:17:25,439 --> 03:17:28,070
yeah
don't you think it captures because gpt3

12110
03:17:28,070 --> 03:17:28,080
don't you think it captures because gpt3
 

12111
03:17:28,080 --> 03:17:30,070
don't you think it captures because gpt3
is fundamentally trained

12112
03:17:30,070 --> 03:17:30,080
is fundamentally trained
 

12113
03:17:30,080 --> 03:17:31,349
is fundamentally trained
on a

12114
03:17:31,349 --> 03:17:31,359
on a
 

12115
03:17:31,359 --> 03:17:33,750
on a
corpus of knowledge

12116
03:17:33,750 --> 03:17:33,760
corpus of knowledge
 

12117
03:17:33,760 --> 03:17:36,150
corpus of knowledge
you know like the internet don't you

12118
03:17:36,150 --> 03:17:36,160
you know like the internet don't you
 

12119
03:17:36,160 --> 03:17:38,229
you know like the internet don't you
think it it gets better and better

12120
03:17:38,229 --> 03:17:38,239
think it it gets better and better
 

12121
03:17:38,239 --> 03:17:39,910
think it it gets better and better
better capturing the memory of all them

12122
03:17:39,910 --> 03:17:39,920
better capturing the memory of all them
 

12123
03:17:39,920 --> 03:17:42,229
better capturing the memory of all them
it will be better at fooling you and at

12124
03:17:42,229 --> 03:17:42,239
it will be better at fooling you and at
 

12125
03:17:42,239 --> 03:17:44,389
it will be better at fooling you and at
some point you won't care

12126
03:17:44,389 --> 03:17:44,399
some point you won't care
 

12127
03:17:44,399 --> 03:17:46,870
some point you won't care
but when it comes i my guess this is as

12128
03:17:46,870 --> 03:17:46,880
but when it comes i my guess this is as
 

12129
03:17:46,880 --> 03:17:48,389
but when it comes i my guess this is as
quick as i was getting to right before

12130
03:17:48,389 --> 03:17:48,399
quick as i was getting to right before
 

12131
03:17:48,399 --> 03:17:51,030
quick as i was getting to right before
we got i got in the love trap

12132
03:17:51,030 --> 03:17:51,040
we got i got in the love trap
 

12133
03:17:51,040 --> 03:18:04,150
we got i got in the love trap
i love trap yeah it was like

12134
03:18:04,150 --> 03:18:04,160

 

12135
03:18:04,160 --> 03:18:06,150

but i think there are other features

12136
03:18:06,150 --> 03:18:06,160
but i think there are other features
 

12137
03:18:06,160 --> 03:18:08,870
but i think there are other features
that allow that we pull on innovation

12138
03:18:08,870 --> 03:18:08,880
that allow that we pull on innovation
 

12139
03:18:08,880 --> 03:18:10,870
that allow that we pull on innovation
that allow us to do more than what we

12140
03:18:10,870 --> 03:18:10,880
that allow us to do more than what we
 

12141
03:18:10,880 --> 03:18:13,349
that allow us to do more than what we
just see in gpthree so if you're being

12142
03:18:13,349 --> 03:18:13,359
just see in gpthree so if you're being
 

12143
03:18:13,359 --> 03:18:15,269
just see in gpthree so if you're being
fooled there so i think what i mean is

12144
03:18:15,269 --> 03:18:15,279
fooled there so i think what i mean is
 

12145
03:18:15,279 --> 03:18:17,030
fooled there so i think what i mean is
human beings have this ability to be

12146
03:18:17,030 --> 03:18:17,040
human beings have this ability to be
 

12147
03:18:17,040 --> 03:18:20,309
human beings have this ability to be
surprising and creative whereas is it

12148
03:18:20,309 --> 03:18:20,319
surprising and creative whereas is it
 

12149
03:18:20,319 --> 03:18:21,429
surprising and creative whereas is it
dali

12150
03:18:21,429 --> 03:18:21,439
dali
 

12151
03:18:21,439 --> 03:18:25,349
dali
this thing or or if you take um gpt3 is

12152
03:18:25,349 --> 03:18:25,359
this thing or or if you take um gpt3 is
 

12153
03:18:25,359 --> 03:18:27,349
this thing or or if you take um gpt3 is
not going to create a new verb

12154
03:18:27,349 --> 03:18:27,359
not going to create a new verb
 

12155
03:18:27,359 --> 03:18:29,990
not going to create a new verb
shakespeare created new verbs

12156
03:18:29,990 --> 03:18:30,000
shakespeare created new verbs
 

12157
03:18:30,000 --> 03:18:31,590
shakespeare created new verbs
you're like wow

12158
03:18:31,590 --> 03:18:31,600
you're like wow
 

12159
03:18:31,600 --> 03:18:33,670
you're like wow
and that required shakespeare to think

12160
03:18:33,670 --> 03:18:33,680
and that required shakespeare to think
 

12161
03:18:33,680 --> 03:18:35,590
and that required shakespeare to think
outside of language in a different

12162
03:18:35,590 --> 03:18:35,600
outside of language in a different
 

12163
03:18:35,600 --> 03:18:36,389
outside of language in a different
domain

12164
03:18:36,389 --> 03:18:36,399
domain
 

12165
03:18:36,399 --> 03:18:38,389
domain
so i think having that connections

12166
03:18:38,389 --> 03:18:38,399
so i think having that connections
 

12167
03:18:38,399 --> 03:18:40,309
so i think having that connections
across multiple domains is what you need

12168
03:18:40,309 --> 03:18:40,319
across multiple domains is what you need
 

12169
03:18:40,319 --> 03:18:42,070
across multiple domains is what you need
for agi yeah but i don't know if you

for agi yeah but i don't know if you
 

12171
03:18:42,080 --> 03:18:43,269

why um why do you use language exactly i
 

12211
03:19:24,239 --> 03:19:25,670
why um why do you use language exactly i
might disagree with that quite

12212
03:19:25,670 --> 03:19:25,680
might disagree with that quite
 

12213
03:19:25,680 --> 03:19:28,550
might disagree with that quite
fundamentally actually um but i don't i

fundamentally actually um but i don't i

i'm not sure i understand how to make a

12218
03:19:32,309 --> 03:19:32,319
coherent argument for that but my
 

12219
03:19:32,319 --> 03:19:33,510
coherent argument for that but my
feeling is

12220
03:19:33,510 --> 03:19:33,520
feeling is
 

12221
03:19:33,520 --> 03:19:34,950
feeling is
that there is

12222
03:19:34,950 --> 03:19:34,960
that there is
 

12223
03:19:34,960 --> 03:19:36,790

12233
03:19:43,840 --> 03:19:45,830
and
and we use those for language for all

12234
03:19:45,830 --> 03:19:45,840
and we use those for language for all
 

12235
03:19:45,840 --> 03:19:47,429
and we use those for language for all
sorts of expressions and we don't yet

12239
03:19:49,359 --> 03:19:51,349
understand that there's a gap we will
get there but i'm saying wouldn't it be

12240
03:19:51,349 --> 03:19:51,359
get there but i'm saying wouldn't it be
 

12241

12246
03:19:58,790 --> 03:19:58,800
human being right and and let's just say
 

12247
03:19:58,800 --> 03:20:00,550

into this other person they would be you
the answer is no and it's quite easy to

12258
03:20:08,229 --> 03:20:08,239
the answer is no and it's quite easy to
 

12259
03:20:08,239 --> 03:20:10,309
the answer is no and it's quite easy to

that a little bit that's maybe from an
 

12281
03:20:29,600 --> 03:20:33,190
that a little bit that's maybe from an
assembly theory perspective but it

12282
03:20:33,190 --> 03:20:33,200
assembly theory perspective but it
 

12283
03:20:33,200 --> 03:20:34,550
assembly theory perspective but it
i don't think it's that difficult to

12284
03:20:34,550 --> 03:20:34,560
i don't think it's that difficult to
 

12285
03:20:34,560 --> 03:20:37,349
i don't think it's that difficult to
recreate a version of me like a clone

12286
03:20:37,349 --> 03:20:37,359
recreate a version of me like a clone
 

12287
03:20:37,359 --> 03:20:40,070
recreate a version of me like a clone
that would make everybody exactly

12288
03:20:40,070 --> 03:20:40,080
that would make everybody exactly
 

12289
03:20:40,080 --> 03:20:43,030
that would make everybody exactly
equally as happy

12290
03:20:43,030 --> 03:20:43,040
equally as happy
 

12291
03:20:43,040 --> 03:20:44,790
equally as happy
like they wouldn't care which one and

12292
03:20:44,790 --> 03:20:44,800
like they wouldn't care which one and
 

12293
03:20:44,800 --> 03:20:46,469
like they wouldn't care which one and
like there's two of me

12294
03:20:46,469 --> 03:20:46,479
like there's two of me
 

12295
03:20:46,479 --> 03:20:47,349
like there's two of me
and then

12296
03:20:47,349 --> 03:20:47,359
and then
 

12297
03:20:47,359 --> 03:20:49,269
and then
they get to pick which one and they'll

12298
03:20:49,269 --> 03:20:49,279
they get to pick which one and they'll
 

12299
03:20:49,279 --> 03:20:51,110
they get to pick which one and they'll
kill either one they'll be fine as long

12300
03:20:51,110 --> 03:20:51,120
kill either one they'll be fine as long
 

12301
03:20:51,120 --> 03:20:52,550
kill either one they'll be fine as long
as they're forced to kill they'll be

12302
03:20:52,550 --> 03:20:52,560
as they're forced to kill they'll be
 

12303
03:20:52,560 --> 03:20:53,830
as they're forced to kill they'll be
fine but here's what will happen is

12304
03:20:53,830 --> 03:20:53,840
fine but here's what will happen is
 

12305
03:20:53,840 --> 03:20:56,150
fine but here's what will happen is
let's say we make artificial legs and it

12306
03:20:56,150 --> 03:20:56,160
let's say we make artificial legs and it
 

12307
03:20:56,160 --> 03:20:57,510
let's say we make artificial legs and it
was like wow that's so cool it looks the

12308
03:20:57,510 --> 03:20:57,520
was like wow that's so cool it looks the
 

12309
03:20:57,520 --> 03:20:59,269
was like wow that's so cool it looks the
same interact then there'll be this

12310
03:20:59,269 --> 03:20:59,279
same interact then there'll be this
 

12311
03:20:59,279 --> 03:21:00,710
same interact then there'll be this
battle of like right we're going to tell

12312
03:21:00,710 --> 03:21:00,720
battle of like right we're going to tell
 

12313
03:21:00,720 --> 03:21:01,910
battle of like right we're going to tell
the difference we're going to we're

12314
03:21:01,910 --> 03:21:01,920
the difference we're going to we're
 

12315
03:21:01,920 --> 03:21:05,030
the difference we're going to we're
going to basically keep nudging lex and

12316
03:21:05,030 --> 03:21:05,040
going to basically keep nudging lex and
 

12317
03:21:05,040 --> 03:21:07,750
going to basically keep nudging lex and
artificial lex until we get

12318
03:21:07,750 --> 03:21:07,760
artificial lex until we get
 

12319
03:21:07,760 --> 03:21:09,590
artificial lex until we get
in novelty from one and we'll kill the

12320
03:21:09,590 --> 03:21:09,600
in novelty from one and we'll kill the
 

12321
03:21:09,600 --> 03:21:10,950
in novelty from one and we'll kill the
other one

12322
03:21:10,950 --> 03:21:10,960
other one
 

12323
03:21:10,960 --> 03:21:13,190
other one
and i think thank you we're not novelty

12324
03:21:13,190 --> 03:21:13,200
and i think thank you we're not novelty
 

12325
03:21:13,200 --> 03:21:15,190
and i think thank you we're not novelty
is a fuzzy concept that's the whole

12326
03:21:15,190 --> 03:21:15,200
is a fuzzy concept that's the whole
 

12327
03:21:15,200 --> 03:21:17,190
is a fuzzy concept that's the whole
problem of novelty so i will define

12328
03:21:17,190 --> 03:21:17,200
problem of novelty so i will define
 

12329
03:21:17,200 --> 03:21:19,670
problem of novelty so i will define
novelty it's not fuzzy novelty is the

12330
03:21:19,670 --> 03:21:19,680
novelty it's not fuzzy novelty is the
 

12331
03:21:19,680 --> 03:21:20,870
novelty it's not fuzzy novelty is the
ability

12332
03:21:20,870 --> 03:21:20,880
ability
 

12333
03:21:20,880 --> 03:21:23,510
ability
um for you to create

12334
03:21:23,510 --> 03:21:23,520
um for you to create
 

12335
03:21:23,520 --> 03:21:25,990
um for you to create
um architectures

12336
03:21:25,990 --> 03:21:26,000
um architectures
 

12337
03:21:26,000 --> 03:21:27,110
um architectures
that are

12338
03:21:27,110 --> 03:21:27,120
that are
 

12339
03:21:27,120 --> 03:21:28,790
that are
um or create an architecture so let's

12340
03:21:28,790 --> 03:21:28,800
um or create an architecture so let's
 

12341
03:21:28,800 --> 03:21:30,229
um or create an architecture so let's
say you've got corpus of architectures

12342
03:21:30,229 --> 03:21:30,239
say you've got corpus of architectures
 

12343
03:21:30,239 --> 03:21:31,590
say you've got corpus of architectures
known you can write down you've got some

12344
03:21:31,590 --> 03:21:31,600
known you can write down you've got some
 

12345
03:21:31,600 --> 03:21:34,229
known you can write down you've got some
distance measure and then i create a new

12346
03:21:34,229 --> 03:21:34,239
distance measure and then i create a new
 

12347
03:21:34,239 --> 03:21:36,150
distance measure and then i create a new
one and the distance measures so far

12348
03:21:36,150 --> 03:21:36,160
one and the distance measures so far
 

12349
03:21:36,160 --> 03:21:38,790
one and the distance measures so far
away from what you'd expected

12350
03:21:38,790 --> 03:21:38,800
away from what you'd expected
 

12351
03:21:38,800 --> 03:21:39,990
away from what you'd expected
there's no linear algebra we're going to

12352
03:21:39,990 --> 03:21:40,000
there's no linear algebra we're going to
 

12353
03:21:40,000 --> 03:21:41,190
there's no linear algebra we're going to
get this like

12354
03:21:41,190 --> 03:21:41,200
get this like
 

12355
03:21:41,200 --> 03:21:41,990
get this like
that

12356
03:21:41,990 --> 03:21:42,000
that
 

12357
03:21:42,000 --> 03:21:45,030
that
is creativity and we don't know how to

12358
03:21:45,030 --> 03:21:45,040
is creativity and we don't know how to
 

12359
03:21:45,040 --> 03:21:46,389
is creativity and we don't know how to
do that yet

12360
03:21:46,389 --> 03:21:46,399
do that yet
 

12361
03:21:46,399 --> 03:21:48,150
do that yet
on any level well i was also thinking

12362
03:21:48,150 --> 03:21:48,160
on any level well i was also thinking
 

12363
03:21:48,160 --> 03:21:49,670
on any level well i was also thinking
about like your argument about free will

12364
03:21:49,670 --> 03:21:49,680
about like your argument about free will
 

12365
03:21:49,680 --> 03:21:51,750
about like your argument about free will
like you wouldn't be able to know it was

12366
03:21:51,750 --> 03:21:51,760
like you wouldn't be able to know it was
 

12367
03:21:51,760 --> 03:21:53,750
like you wouldn't be able to know it was
it doesn't work instantaneously it's not

12368
03:21:53,750 --> 03:21:53,760
it doesn't work instantaneously it's not
 

12369
03:21:53,760 --> 03:21:55,910
it doesn't work instantaneously it's not
like a micro level thing but more a

12370
03:21:55,910 --> 03:21:55,920
like a micro level thing but more a
 

12371
03:21:55,920 --> 03:21:57,349
like a micro level thing but more a
macro level thing over the scale of

12372
03:21:57,349 --> 03:21:57,359
macro level thing over the scale of
 

12373
03:21:57,359 --> 03:21:59,750
macro level thing over the scale of
trajectories or longer term decisions so

12374
03:21:59,750 --> 03:21:59,760
trajectories or longer term decisions so
 

12375
03:21:59,760 --> 03:22:02,309
trajectories or longer term decisions so
if you think that the novelty manifests

12376
03:22:02,309 --> 03:22:02,319
if you think that the novelty manifests
 

12377
03:22:02,319 --> 03:22:04,070
if you think that the novelty manifests
over those longer time scales it might

12378
03:22:04,070 --> 03:22:04,080
over those longer time scales it might
 

12379
03:22:04,080 --> 03:22:04,950
over those longer time scales it might
be

12380
03:22:04,950 --> 03:22:04,960
be
 

12381
03:22:04,960 --> 03:22:06,710
be
the two lexes

12382
03:22:06,710 --> 03:22:06,720
the two lexes
 

12383
03:22:06,720 --> 03:22:08,870
the two lexes
diverge quite a bit

12384
03:22:08,870 --> 03:22:08,880
diverge quite a bit
 

12385
03:22:08,880 --> 03:22:10,950
diverge quite a bit
over certain time scales of their

12386

over certain time scales of their
 

12387
03:22:10,960 --> 03:22:13,349
over certain time scales of their
behavior nobody would notice

12388
03:22:13,349 --> 03:22:13,359
behavior nobody would notice
 

12389
03:22:13,359 --> 03:22:15,030
behavior nobody would notice
the difference

12390
03:22:15,030 --> 03:22:15,040
the difference
 

12391
03:22:15,040 --> 03:22:16,790
the difference
they might not

12392
03:22:16,790 --> 03:22:16,800
they might not
 

12393
03:22:16,800 --> 03:22:19,349
they might not
and the universe the earth won't notice

12394
03:22:19,349 --> 03:22:19,359
and the universe the earth won't notice
 

12395
03:22:19,359 --> 03:22:20,950
and the universe the earth won't notice
the difference the universe won't notice

12396
03:22:20,950 --> 03:22:20,960
the difference the universe won't notice
 

12397
03:22:20,960 --> 03:22:22,389
the difference the universe won't notice
the universe would notice the difference

12398
03:22:22,389 --> 03:22:22,399
the universe would notice the difference
 

12399
03:22:22,399 --> 03:22:24,229
the universe would notice the difference
no the universe doesn't know about his

12400
03:22:24,229 --> 03:22:24,239
no the universe doesn't know about his
 

12401

no the universe doesn't know about his
novelty that's being generated that's

12402
03:22:25,670 --> 03:22:25,680
novelty that's being generated that's
 

12403
03:22:25,680 --> 03:22:27,910
novelty that's being generated that's
the whole point of well no but this is

12404
03:22:27,910 --> 03:22:27,920
the whole point of well no but this is
 

12405
03:22:27,920 --> 03:22:29,990
the whole point of well no but this is
what selection is right it's like taking

12406
03:22:29,990 --> 03:22:30,000
what selection is right it's like taking
 

12407
03:22:30,000 --> 03:22:33,030
what selection is right it's like taking
nearly equivalent ones and then deciding

12408
03:22:33,030 --> 03:22:33,040
nearly equivalent ones and then deciding
 

12409
03:22:33,040 --> 03:22:34,870
nearly equivalent ones and then deciding
like the universe selects right so what

12410
03:22:34,870 --> 03:22:34,880
like the universe selects right so what
 

12411
03:22:34,880 --> 03:22:36,870
like the universe selects right so what
whatever selection is select some things

12412
03:22:36,870 --> 03:22:36,880
whatever selection is select some things
 

12413
03:22:36,880 --> 03:22:38,469
whatever selection is select some things
to persist in time yeah i'm going to

12414
03:22:38,469 --> 03:22:38,479
to persist in time yeah i'm going to
 

12415
03:22:38,479 --> 03:22:40,870
to persist in time yeah i'm going to
select the artificial one someone still

12416
03:22:40,870 --> 03:22:40,880
select the artificial one someone still
 

12417
03:22:40,880 --> 03:22:42,630
select the artificial one someone still
likes that one better well you're mixing

12418
03:22:42,630 --> 03:22:42,640
likes that one better well you're mixing
 

12419
03:22:42,640 --> 03:22:44,309
likes that one better well you're mixing
up two arguments here so look let's go

12420
03:22:44,309 --> 03:22:44,319
up two arguments here so look let's go
 

12421
03:22:44,319 --> 03:22:46,150
up two arguments here so look let's go
back a second what are you basing this

12422
03:22:46,150 --> 03:22:46,160
back a second what are you basing this
 

12423
03:22:46,160 --> 03:22:48,469
back a second what are you basing this
argument on like i'm just saying that i

12424
03:22:48,469 --> 03:22:48,479
argument on like i'm just saying that i
 

12425
03:22:48,479 --> 03:22:49,590
argument on like i'm just saying that i
kind of

12426
03:22:49,590 --> 03:22:49,600
kind of
 

12427
03:22:49,600 --> 03:22:51,510
kind of
don't think cause at least said that

12428
03:22:51,510 --> 03:22:51,520
don't think cause at least said that
 

12429
03:22:51,520 --> 03:22:53,590
don't think cause at least said that
it's not possible

12430
03:22:53,590 --> 03:22:53,600
it's not possible
 

12431
03:22:53,600 --> 03:22:55,030
it's not possible
like if you uh

12432
03:22:55,030 --> 03:22:55,040
like if you uh
 

12433
03:22:55,040 --> 03:22:57,269
like if you uh
the the if you copy every single

12434
03:22:57,269 --> 03:22:57,279
the the if you copy every single
 

12435
03:22:57,279 --> 03:22:59,510
the the if you copy every single
molecule in a person's body that's not

12436
03:22:59,510 --> 03:22:59,520
molecule in a person's body that's not
 

12437
03:22:59,520 --> 03:23:01,670
molecule in a person's body that's not
going to be the same person

12438
03:23:01,670 --> 03:23:01,680
going to be the same person
 

12439
03:23:01,680 --> 03:23:04,309
going to be the same person
that that they won't have the same

12440
03:23:04,309 --> 03:23:04,319
that that they won't have the same
 

12441
03:23:04,319 --> 03:23:05,910
that that they won't have the same
assembly index they won't have it won't

12442
03:23:05,910 --> 03:23:05,920
assembly index they won't have it won't
 

12443
03:23:05,920 --> 03:23:07,830
assembly index they won't have it won't
be the same person and i just don't i

12444
03:23:07,830 --> 03:23:07,840
be the same person and i just don't i
 

12445
03:23:07,840 --> 03:23:10,389
be the same person and i just don't i
think copying you can compress not only

12446
03:23:10,389 --> 03:23:10,399
think copying you can compress not only
 

12447
03:23:10,399 --> 03:23:12,150
think copying you can compress not only
do i disagree with that

12448
03:23:12,150 --> 03:23:12,160
do i disagree with that
 

12449
03:23:12,160 --> 03:23:13,030
do i disagree with that
i just

12450
03:23:13,030 --> 03:23:13,040
i just
 

12451
03:23:13,040 --> 03:23:14,950
i just
i think you can even compress a person

12452
03:23:14,950 --> 03:23:14,960
i think you can even compress a person
 

12453
03:23:14,960 --> 03:23:16,950
i think you can even compress a person
down to some where you can fool the

12454
03:23:16,950 --> 03:23:16,960
down to some where you can fool the
 

12455
03:23:16,960 --> 03:23:18,950
down to some where you can fool the
universe i'm saying

12456
03:23:18,950 --> 03:23:18,960
universe i'm saying
 

12457
03:23:18,960 --> 03:23:21,269
universe i'm saying
let me restate it it is not possible to

12458
03:23:21,269 --> 03:23:21,279
let me restate it it is not possible to
 

12459
03:23:21,279 --> 03:23:23,429
let me restate it it is not possible to
copy somebody

12460
03:23:23,429 --> 03:23:23,439
copy somebody
 

12461
03:23:23,439 --> 03:23:25,670
copy somebody
on because you unless you copy the

12462
03:23:25,670 --> 03:23:25,680
on because you unless you copy the
 

12463
03:23:25,680 --> 03:23:28,309
on because you unless you copy the
causal history also you can't have two

12464
03:23:28,309 --> 03:23:28,319
causal history also you can't have two
 

12465
03:23:28,319 --> 03:23:30,229
causal history also you can't have two
identical i mean actually i really like

12466
03:23:30,229 --> 03:23:30,239
identical i mean actually i really like
 

12467
03:23:30,239 --> 03:23:31,429
identical i mean actually i really like
the idea that everything in the universe

12468
03:23:31,429 --> 03:23:31,439
the idea that everything in the universe
 

12469
03:23:31,439 --> 03:23:33,349
the idea that everything in the universe
is unique so even if like there were two

12470
03:23:33,349 --> 03:23:33,359
is unique so even if like there were two
 

12471
03:23:33,359 --> 03:23:34,790
is unique so even if like there were two
lectures i know you like that idea

12472
03:23:34,790 --> 03:23:34,800
lectures i know you like that idea
 

12473
03:23:34,800 --> 03:23:36,150
lectures i know you like that idea
because you're human and you think

12474
03:23:36,150 --> 03:23:36,160
because you're human and you think
 

12475
03:23:36,160 --> 03:23:38,150
because you're human and you think
you're unique yeah exactly but also i

12476
03:23:38,150 --> 03:23:38,160
you're unique yeah exactly but also i
 

12477
03:23:38,160 --> 03:23:39,590
you're unique yeah exactly but also i
can make a logical argument for it that

12478
03:23:39,590 --> 03:23:39,600
can make a logical argument for it that
 

12479
03:23:39,600 --> 03:23:41,590
can make a logical argument for it that
even if we could copy you know all of

12480
03:23:41,590 --> 03:23:41,600
even if we could copy you know all of
 

12481
03:23:41,600 --> 03:23:43,030
even if we could copy you know all of
your molecules and all their positions

12482
03:23:43,030 --> 03:23:43,040
your molecules and all their positions
 

12483
03:23:43,040 --> 03:23:44,630
your molecules and all their positions
the other you would be there and you

12484
03:23:44,630 --> 03:23:44,640
the other you would be there and you
 

12485
03:23:44,640 --> 03:23:47,590
the other you would be there and you
have a different position in space

12486
03:23:47,590 --> 03:23:47,600
have a different position in space
 

12487
03:23:47,600 --> 03:23:49,110
have a different position in space
you're distinguishable yeah the other

12488
03:23:49,110 --> 03:23:49,120
you're distinguishable yeah the other
 

12489
03:23:49,120 --> 03:23:51,190
you're distinguishable yeah the other
thing always how unique are you just

12490
03:23:51,190 --> 03:23:51,200
thing always how unique are you just
 

12491
03:23:51,200 --> 03:23:53,349
thing always how unique are you just
about the position in space really sure

12492
03:23:53,349 --> 03:23:53,359
about the position in space really sure
 

12493
03:23:53,359 --> 03:23:55,190
about the position in space really sure
but then how much does that light

12494
03:23:55,190 --> 03:23:55,200
but then how much does that light
 

12495
03:23:55,200 --> 03:23:58,790
but then how much does that light
translation of lex well that's

12496
03:23:58,790 --> 03:23:58,800
translation of lex well that's
 

12497
03:23:58,800 --> 03:24:00,070
translation of lex well that's
i see but

12498
03:24:00,070 --> 03:24:00,080
i see but
 

12499
03:24:00,080 --> 03:24:02,309
i see but
but no wait wait a minute

12500
03:24:02,309 --> 03:24:02,319
but no wait wait a minute
 

12501
03:24:02,319 --> 03:24:04,630

being interesting is how much it affects

12504
03:24:06,469 --> 03:24:06,479
being interesting is how much it affects
 

12505
03:24:06,479 --> 03:24:07,750
being interesting is how much it affects
the future

12506
03:24:07,750 --> 03:24:07,760
the future
 

12507
03:24:07,760 --> 03:24:09,349
the future
yes yes

12508
03:24:09,349 --> 03:24:09,359
yes yes
 

12509
03:24:09,359 --> 03:24:10,710
yes yes
but let me come back don't you agree but

12510
03:24:10,710 --> 03:24:10,720
but let me come back don't you agree but
 

12511
03:24:10,720 --> 03:24:12,550
but let me come back don't you agree but
let me up you disagree one point quickly

12512
03:24:12,550 --> 03:24:12,560
let me up you disagree one point quickly
 

12513
03:24:12,560 --> 03:24:14,309
let me up you disagree one point quickly
that you were making sure i think i

12514
03:24:14,309 --> 03:24:14,319
that you were making sure i think i
 

12515
03:24:14,319 --> 03:24:15,910
that you were making sure i think i
probably agree yeah if there's two

12516
03:24:15,910 --> 03:24:15,920
probably agree yeah if there's two
 

12517
03:24:15,920 --> 03:24:17,750
probably agree yeah if there's two
lectures right there's a robot lex that

12518
03:24:17,750 --> 03:24:17,760
lectures right there's a robot lex that
 

12519
03:24:17,760 --> 03:24:20,469
lectures right there's a robot lex that
you just basically it's a it's a it is a

12520
03:24:20,469 --> 03:24:20,479
you just basically it's a it's a it is a
 

12521
03:24:20,479 --> 03:24:22,630
you just basically it's a it's a it is a
charade it's a facsimile

12522
03:24:22,630 --> 03:24:22,640
charade it's a facsimile
 

12523
03:24:22,640 --> 03:24:24,950
charade it's a facsimile
it's just coded

12524
03:24:24,950 --> 03:24:24,960
it's just coded
 

12525
03:24:24,960 --> 03:24:27,429
it's just coded
to emulate you

12526
03:24:27,429 --> 03:24:27,439
to emulate you
 

12527
03:24:27,439 --> 03:24:29,750
to emulate you
are you robot lex but another one no

12528
03:24:29,750 --> 03:24:29,760
are you robot lex but another one no
 

12529
03:24:29,760 --> 03:24:31,030
are you robot lex but another one no
let's get that but let's get there's a

12530
03:24:31,030 --> 03:24:31,040
let's get that but let's get there's a
 

12531
03:24:31,040 --> 03:24:32,710
let's get that but let's get there's a
point a very important point here

12532
03:24:32,710 --> 03:24:32,720
point a very important point here
 

12533
03:24:32,720 --> 03:24:34,309
point a very important point here
because he's he's ducking and diving

12534
03:24:34,309 --> 03:24:34,319
because he's he's ducking and diving
 

12535
03:24:34,319 --> 03:24:37,429
because he's he's ducking and diving
between this i so so if i faximilied you

12536
03:24:37,429 --> 03:24:37,439
between this i so so if i faximilied you
 

12537
03:24:37,439 --> 03:24:39,830
between this i so so if i faximilied you
into a robot then it would you your

12538
03:24:39,830 --> 03:24:39,840
into a robot then it would you your
 

12539
03:24:39,840 --> 03:24:41,670
into a robot then it would you your
robot might be

12540
03:24:41,670 --> 03:24:41,680
robot might be
 

12541
03:24:41,680 --> 03:24:43,269
robot might be
would be a representation of you now but

12542
03:24:43,269 --> 03:24:43,279
would be a representation of you now but
 

12543
03:24:43,279 --> 03:24:44,389
would be a representation of you now but
fundamentally be boring because you'll

12544
03:24:44,389 --> 03:24:44,399
fundamentally be boring because you'll
 

12545
03:24:44,399 --> 03:24:46,070
fundamentally be boring because you'll
go and have other ideas if however you

12546
03:24:46,070 --> 03:24:46,080
go and have other ideas if however you
 

12547
03:24:46,080 --> 03:24:48,469
go and have other ideas if however you
built an architecture that itself was

12548
03:24:48,469 --> 03:24:48,479
built an architecture that itself was
 

12549
03:24:48,479 --> 03:24:50,309
built an architecture that itself was
capable of generating novelty you would

12550
03:24:50,309 --> 03:24:50,319
capable of generating novelty you would
 

12551
03:24:50,319 --> 03:24:52,150
capable of generating novelty you would
diverge in your causal chain and you

12552
03:24:52,150 --> 03:24:52,160
diverge in your causal chain and you
 

12553
03:24:52,160 --> 03:24:54,070
diverge in your causal chain and you
both be equally interesting to interact

12554
03:24:54,070 --> 03:24:54,080
both be equally interesting to interact
 

12555
03:24:54,080 --> 03:24:56,229
both be equally interesting to interact
with yeah we don't know that mechanism

12557
03:24:56,239 --> 03:24:57,349
with yeah we don't know that mechanism
all i'm trying to say is we don't yet

03:24:59,110 --> 03:24:59,120
know that mechanism we do not know the
 

12561
03:24:59,120 --> 03:25:01,349
know that mechanism we do not know the

12565
03:25:05,200 --> 03:25:07,590
the moment in our ais we are emulating
we are not generating you don't think

12566
03:25:07,590 --> 03:25:07,600
we are not generating you don't think
 

12567
03:25:07,600 --> 03:25:09,429
we are not generating you don't think
we're sneaking up on that do you think

12568
03:25:09,429 --> 03:25:09,439
we're sneaking up on that do you think
 

12569
03:25:09,439 --> 03:25:10,790
we're sneaking up on that do you think
there's something no no there is no

ghost in the machine

12572
03:25:13,429 --> 03:25:13,439
ghost in the machine
 

12573
03:25:13,439 --> 03:25:15,030
ghost in the machine
and i want there to be one

12574
03:25:15,030 --> 03:25:15,040
and i want there to be one
 

12575
03:25:15,040 --> 03:25:16,790
and i want there to be one
i want the same thing you want sorry i

12576
03:25:16,790 --> 03:25:16,800
i want the same thing you want sorry i
 

12577
03:25:16,800 --> 03:25:19,190
i want the same thing you want sorry i
know you want that as a human because

12578
03:25:19,190 --> 03:25:19,200
know you want that as a human because
 

12579
03:25:19,200 --> 03:25:21,429
know you want that as a human because
everything you just said makes you feel

12580
03:25:21,429 --> 03:25:21,439
everything you just said makes you feel
 

12581
03:25:21,439 --> 03:25:23,110
everything you just said makes you feel
more special i want to be certain no no

12582
03:25:23,110 --> 03:25:23,120
more special i want to be certain no no
 

12583
03:25:23,120 --> 03:25:24,710
more special i want to be certain no no
no screw my specialness i just want to

12584
03:25:24,710 --> 03:25:24,720
no screw my specialness i just want to
 

12585
03:25:24,720 --> 03:25:25,990
no screw my specialness i just want to
be surprised

12586
03:25:25,990 --> 03:25:26,000
be surprised
 

12587
03:25:26,000 --> 03:25:28,790
be surprised
if i negoroba can surprise you if i if

12588
03:25:28,790 --> 03:25:28,800
if i negoroba can surprise you if i if
 

12589
03:25:28,800 --> 03:25:30,469
if i negoroba can surprise you if i if
you can produce an algorithm

12590
03:25:30,469 --> 03:25:30,479
you can produce an algorithm
 

12591
03:25:30,479 --> 03:25:32,630
you can produce an algorithm
instantiated in a row what surprised me

12592
03:25:32,630 --> 03:25:32,640
instantiated in a row what surprised me
 

12593
03:25:32,640 --> 03:25:33,590
instantiated in a row what surprised me
i will

12594
03:25:33,590 --> 03:25:33,600
i will
 

12595
03:25:33,600 --> 03:25:35,349
i will
i will i will i will

12596
03:25:35,349 --> 03:25:35,359
i will i will i will
 

12597
03:25:35,359 --> 03:25:36,710
i will i will i will
i will have one of those robots it'll be

12598
03:25:36,710 --> 03:25:36,720
i will have one of those robots it'll be
 

12599
03:25:36,720 --> 03:25:39,670
i will have one of those robots it'll be
brilliant but they won't surprise me

12600
03:25:39,670 --> 03:25:39,680
brilliant but they won't surprise me
 

12601
03:25:39,680 --> 03:25:41,830
brilliant but they won't surprise me
but why why is it a problem to think

12602
03:25:41,830 --> 03:25:41,840
but why why is it a problem to think
 

12603
03:25:41,840 --> 03:25:44,309
but why why is it a problem to think
that humans are special

12604
03:25:44,309 --> 03:25:44,319
that humans are special
 

12605
03:25:44,319 --> 03:25:45,750
that humans are special
maybe it's not the special you're right

12606
03:25:45,750 --> 03:25:45,760
maybe it's not the special you're right
 

12607
03:25:45,760 --> 03:25:48,550
maybe it's not the special you're right
it's the better than yes

12608
03:25:48,550 --> 03:25:48,560
it's the better than yes
 

12609
03:25:48,560 --> 03:25:51,349
it's the better than yes
because then you start to not recognize

12610
03:25:51,349 --> 03:25:51,359
because then you start to not recognize
 

12611
03:25:51,359 --> 03:25:53,750
because then you start to not recognize
the magic in other life forms that you

12612
03:25:53,750 --> 03:25:53,760
the magic in other life forms that you
 

12613
03:25:53,760 --> 03:25:56,070
the magic in other life forms that you
either have created or you have observed

12614
03:25:56,070 --> 03:25:56,080
either have created or you have observed
 

12615
03:25:56,080 --> 03:25:58,790
either have created or you have observed
because i just think there's magic and

12616
03:25:58,790 --> 03:25:58,800
because i just think there's magic and
 

12617
03:25:58,800 --> 03:25:59,670
because i just think there's magic and
uh

12618
03:25:59,670 --> 03:25:59,680
uh
 

12619
03:25:59,680 --> 03:26:02,150
uh
legged robots moving about and they are

12620
03:26:02,150 --> 03:26:02,160
legged robots moving about and they are
 

12621
03:26:02,160 --> 03:26:04,630
legged robots moving about and they are
full of surprises yeah so this is

12622
03:26:04,630 --> 03:26:04,640
full of surprises yeah so this is
 

12623
03:26:04,640 --> 03:26:06,070
full of surprises yeah so this is
nationality

12624
03:26:06,070 --> 03:26:06,080
nationality
 

12625
03:26:06,080 --> 03:26:08,790
nationality
yeah so i'm a little

12626
03:26:08,790 --> 03:26:08,800
yeah so i'm a little
 

12627
03:26:08,800 --> 03:26:10,469
yeah so i'm a little
uh i know where you like cellular

12628
03:26:10,469 --> 03:26:10,479
uh i know where you like cellular
 

12629
03:26:10,479 --> 03:26:12,950
uh i know where you like cellular
automata right but the specialness in

12630
03:26:12,950 --> 03:26:12,960
automata right but the specialness in
 

12631
03:26:12,960 --> 03:26:14,389
automata right but the specialness in
your robot

12632
03:26:14,389 --> 03:26:14,399
your robot
 

12633
03:26:14,399 --> 03:26:19,110
your robot
comes from the roboticist that built it

12634
03:26:19,110 --> 03:26:19,120
comes from the roboticist that built it
 

12635
03:26:19,120 --> 03:26:21,429
comes from the roboticist that built it
yeah it's part of the lineage yeah and

12636
03:26:21,429 --> 03:26:21,439
yeah it's part of the lineage yeah and
 

12637
03:26:21,439 --> 03:26:23,110
yeah it's part of the lineage yeah and
so that's fine i'm happy with that

12638
03:26:23,110 --> 03:26:23,120
so that's fine i'm happy with that
 

12639
03:26:23,120 --> 03:26:24,389
so that's fine i'm happy with that
that's what i felt like looking at the

12640
03:26:24,389 --> 03:26:24,399
that's what i felt like looking at the
 

12641
03:26:24,399 --> 03:26:25,990
that's what i felt like looking at the
standing robot was i was looking at four

12642
03:26:25,990 --> 03:26:26,000
standing robot was i was looking at four
 

12643
03:26:26,000 --> 03:26:27,990
standing robot was i was looking at four
billion years of evolution yeah right if

12644
03:26:27,990 --> 03:26:28,000
billion years of evolution yeah right if
 

12645
03:26:28,000 --> 03:26:29,910
billion years of evolution yeah right if
it wasn't so i think i'm happy i mean

12646
03:26:29,910 --> 03:26:29,920
it wasn't so i think i'm happy i mean
 

12647
03:26:29,920 --> 03:26:31,750
it wasn't so i think i'm happy i mean
i'm happy we're going to co-exist i'm

12648
03:26:31,750 --> 03:26:31,760
i'm happy we're going to co-exist i'm
 

12649
03:26:31,760 --> 03:26:32,870
i'm happy we're going to co-exist i'm
just saying you're going to get more

12650
03:26:32,870 --> 03:26:32,880
just saying you're going to get more
 

12651
03:26:32,880 --> 03:26:34,389
just saying you're going to get more
excitement there's something missing in

12652
03:26:34,389 --> 03:26:34,399
excitement there's something missing in
 

12653
03:26:34,399 --> 03:26:35,910
excitement there's something missing in
our understanding of intelligence

12654
03:26:35,910 --> 03:26:35,920
our understanding of intelligence
 

12655
03:26:35,920 --> 03:26:37,590
our understanding of intelligence
intelligence isn't just

12656
03:26:37,590 --> 03:26:37,600
intelligence isn't just
 

12657
03:26:37,600 --> 03:26:38,630
intelligence isn't just
training

12658
03:26:38,630 --> 03:26:38,640
training
 

12659
03:26:38,640 --> 03:26:40,229
training
uh the way the neural network is

12660
03:26:40,229 --> 03:26:40,239
uh the way the neural network is
 

12661
03:26:40,239 --> 03:26:41,670
uh the way the neural network is
conceived right now is great and it's

12662
03:26:41,670 --> 03:26:41,680
conceived right now is great and it's
 

12663
03:26:41,680 --> 03:26:43,269
conceived right now is great and it's
lovely and it'll be brighter and we'll

12664
03:26:43,269 --> 03:26:43,279
lovely and it'll be brighter and we'll
 

12665
03:26:43,279 --> 03:26:44,870
lovely and it'll be brighter and we'll
argue forever but

12666
03:26:44,870 --> 03:26:44,880
argue forever but
 

12667
03:26:44,880 --> 03:26:47,030
argue forever but
you want to know wouldn't it be great if

12668
03:26:47,030 --> 03:26:47,040
you want to know wouldn't it be great if
 

12669
03:26:47,040 --> 03:26:48,389
you want to know wouldn't it be great if
i said look i know how to invent an

12670
03:26:48,389 --> 03:26:48,399
i said look i know how to invent an
 

12671
03:26:48,399 --> 03:26:51,269
i said look i know how to invent an
architecture and i can give it a soul

12672
03:26:51,269 --> 03:26:51,279
architecture and i can give it a soul
 

12673
03:26:51,279 --> 03:26:53,510
architecture and i can give it a soul
and what i mean by a soul

12674
03:26:53,510 --> 03:26:53,520
and what i mean by a soul
 

12675
03:26:53,520 --> 03:26:55,670
and what i mean by a soul
is some i know for

12676
03:26:55,670 --> 03:26:55,680
is some i know for
 

12677
03:26:55,680 --> 03:26:58,630
is some i know for
real that there is internal reference

12678
03:26:58,630 --> 03:26:58,640
real that there is internal reference
 

12679
03:26:58,640 --> 03:27:00,229
real that there is internal reference
as soon as like not fake internal

12680
03:27:00,229 --> 03:27:00,239
as soon as like not fake internal
 

12681
03:27:00,239 --> 03:27:01,990
as soon as like not fake internal
reference and if we could generate that

12682
03:27:01,990 --> 03:27:02,000
reference and if we could generate that
 

12683
03:27:02,000 --> 03:27:03,429
reference and if we could generate that
mechanism for internal reference that's

12684
03:27:03,429 --> 03:27:03,439
mechanism for internal reference that's
 

12685
03:27:03,439 --> 03:27:04,950
mechanism for internal reference that's
why our goal direction that's why you

12686
03:27:04,950 --> 03:27:04,960
why our goal direction that's why you
 

12687
03:27:04,960 --> 03:27:07,110
why our goal direction that's why you
have to we can do that

12688
03:27:07,110 --> 03:27:07,120
have to we can do that
 

12689
03:27:07,120 --> 03:27:08,389
have to we can do that
get that goal directing this you would

12690
03:27:08,389 --> 03:27:08,399
get that goal directing this you would
 

12691
03:27:08,399 --> 03:27:09,830
get that goal directing this you would
love that robot more than the one that's

12692
03:27:09,830 --> 03:27:09,840
love that robot more than the one that's
 

12693
03:27:09,840 --> 03:27:12,790
love that robot more than the one that's
just made to look like it does

12694
03:27:12,790 --> 03:27:12,800
just made to look like it does
 

12695
03:27:12,800 --> 03:27:14,070
just made to look like it does
because you'll have more fun with it

12696
03:27:14,070 --> 03:27:14,080
because you'll have more fun with it
 

12697
03:27:14,080 --> 03:27:15,670
because you'll have more fun with it
because you better generate

12698
03:27:15,670 --> 03:27:15,680
because you better generate
 

12699
03:27:15,680 --> 03:27:18,550
because you better generate
search other problems get more novelty

12700
03:27:18,550 --> 03:27:18,560
search other problems get more novelty
 

12701
03:27:18,560 --> 03:27:19,750
search other problems get more novelty
hell you'll be able to fall in love with

12702
03:27:19,750 --> 03:27:19,760
hell you'll be able to fall in love with
 

12703
03:27:19,760 --> 03:27:21,910
hell you'll be able to fall in love with
that robot for real but not the one

12704
03:27:21,910 --> 03:27:21,920
that robot for real but not the one
 

12705
03:27:21,920 --> 03:27:24,389
that robot for real but not the one
that's faking it

12706
03:27:24,389 --> 03:27:24,399
that's faking it
 

12707
03:27:24,399 --> 03:27:26,469
that's faking it
what about fake it till you make it

12708
03:27:26,469 --> 03:27:26,479
what about fake it till you make it
 

12709
03:27:26,479 --> 03:27:28,469
what about fake it till you make it
well i think a lot of people fall in

12710
03:27:28,469 --> 03:27:28,479
well i think a lot of people fall in
 

12711
03:27:28,479 --> 03:27:31,990
well i think a lot of people fall in
love with with um with with fake

12712
03:27:31,990 --> 03:27:32,000
love with with um with with fake
 

12713
03:27:32,000 --> 03:27:35,190
love with with um with with fake
yep humans yeah it's it's nice to it's

12714
03:27:35,190 --> 03:27:35,200
yep humans yeah it's it's nice to it's
 

12715
03:27:35,200 --> 03:27:36,550
yep humans yeah it's it's nice to it's
nice to fall in love with something

12716
03:27:36,550 --> 03:27:36,560
nice to fall in love with something
 

12717
03:27:36,560 --> 03:27:39,190
nice to fall in love with something
that's full of novelty yes i

12718
03:27:39,190 --> 03:27:39,200
that's full of novelty yes i
 

12719
03:27:39,200 --> 03:27:40,950
that's full of novelty yes i
you know i can imagine all kinds of

12720
03:27:40,950 --> 03:27:40,960
you know i can imagine all kinds of
 

12721
03:27:40,960 --> 03:27:42,630
you know i can imagine all kinds of
robots that i would want to have a close

12722
03:27:42,630 --> 03:27:42,640
robots that i would want to have a close
 

12723
03:27:42,640 --> 03:27:44,070
robots that i would want to have a close
relationship with

12724
03:27:44,070 --> 03:27:44,080
relationship with
 

12725
03:27:44,080 --> 03:27:45,910
relationship with
and i don't mean like sexual i mean like

12726
03:27:45,910 --> 03:27:45,920
and i don't mean like sexual i mean like
 

12727
03:27:45,920 --> 03:27:47,190
and i don't mean like sexual i mean like
intimacy

12728
03:27:47,190 --> 03:27:47,200
intimacy
 

12729
03:27:47,200 --> 03:27:51,110
intimacy
because but i just don't think that um

12730
03:27:51,110 --> 03:27:51,120
because but i just don't think that um
 

12731
03:27:51,120 --> 03:27:55,990
because but i just don't think that um
novelty generation is such a special

12732
03:27:55,990 --> 03:27:56,000

 

12733
03:27:56,000 --> 03:27:57,830

okay there's like mathematical novelty

12734
03:27:57,830 --> 03:27:57,840
okay there's like mathematical novelty
 

12735
03:27:57,840 --> 03:27:59,269
okay there's like mathematical novelty
or something like that and then there's

12736
03:27:59,269 --> 03:27:59,279
or something like that and then there's
 

12737
03:27:59,279 --> 03:28:00,950
or something like that and then there's
just humans being surprised and i think

12738
03:28:00,950 --> 03:28:00,960
just humans being surprised and i think
 

12739
03:28:00,960 --> 03:28:03,269
just humans being surprised and i think
we're easily surprised that's fine but

12740
03:28:03,269 --> 03:28:03,279
we're easily surprised that's fine but
 

12741
03:28:03,279 --> 03:28:04,710
we're easily surprised that's fine but
that's that but you don't think that's a

12742
03:28:04,710 --> 03:28:04,720
that's that but you don't think that's a
 

12743
03:28:04,720 --> 03:28:06,469
that's that but you don't think that's a
good deal no that's good i'm happy to be

12744
03:28:06,469 --> 03:28:06,479
good deal no that's good i'm happy to be
 

12745
03:28:06,479 --> 03:28:07,830
good deal no that's good i'm happy to be
surprised

12746
03:28:07,830 --> 03:28:07,840
surprised
 

12747
03:28:07,840 --> 03:28:09,670
surprised
um

12748
03:28:09,670 --> 03:28:09,680
um
 

12749
03:28:09,680 --> 03:28:11,269
um
but not globally surprised because

12750
03:28:11,269 --> 03:28:11,279
but not globally surprised because
 

12751
03:28:11,279 --> 03:28:13,590
but not globally surprised because
someone else but i really want i was why

12752
03:28:13,590 --> 03:28:13,600
someone else but i really want i was why
 

12753
03:28:13,600 --> 03:28:16,550
someone else but i really want i was why
i'm a scientist i really want to be

12754
03:28:16,550 --> 03:28:16,560
i'm a scientist i really want to be
 

12755
03:28:16,560 --> 03:28:17,990
i'm a scientist i really want to be
the first to be surprised about

12756
03:28:17,990 --> 03:28:18,000
the first to be surprised about
 

12757
03:28:18,000 --> 03:28:19,830
the first to be surprised about
something and the first thing in the

12758
03:28:19,830 --> 03:28:19,840
something and the first thing in the
 

12759
03:28:19,840 --> 03:28:21,510
something and the first thing in the
first in the universe to create that

12760
03:28:21,510 --> 03:28:21,520
first in the universe to create that
 

12761
03:28:21,520 --> 03:28:23,429
first in the universe to create that
novelty and to know for sure that that

12762
03:28:23,429 --> 03:28:23,439
novelty and to know for sure that that
 

12763
03:28:23,439 --> 03:28:25,990
novelty and to know for sure that that
novelty has never occurred anywhere else

12764
03:28:25,990 --> 03:28:26,000
novelty has never occurred anywhere else
 

12765
03:28:26,000 --> 03:28:27,990
novelty has never occurred anywhere else
that's a real buzz right that's a way to

12766
03:28:27,990 --> 03:28:28,000
that's a real buzz right that's a way to
 

12767
03:28:28,000 --> 03:28:29,830
that's a real buzz right that's a way to
really know that i i you have to have a

12768
03:28:29,830 --> 03:28:29,840
really know that i i you have to have a
 

12769
03:28:29,840 --> 03:28:31,429
really know that i i you have to have a
really big look update

12770
03:28:31,429 --> 03:28:31,439
really big look update
 

12771
03:28:31,439 --> 03:28:33,190
really big look update
right yeah you're never gonna know for

12772
03:28:33,190 --> 03:28:33,200
right yeah you're never gonna know for
 

12773
03:28:33,200 --> 03:28:35,030
right yeah you're never gonna know for
sure right that's that's one of the hard

12774
03:28:35,030 --> 03:28:35,040
sure right that's that's one of the hard
 

12775
03:28:35,040 --> 03:28:36,550
sure right that's that's one of the hard
things about being

12776
03:28:36,550 --> 03:28:36,560
things about being
 

12777
03:28:36,560 --> 03:28:37,990
things about being
and scientists searching for this type

12778
03:28:37,990 --> 03:28:38,000
and scientists searching for this type
 

12779
03:28:38,000 --> 03:28:40,389
and scientists searching for this type
of novelty maybe that's why mathematics

12780
03:28:40,389 --> 03:28:40,399
of novelty maybe that's why mathematics
 

12781
03:28:40,399 --> 03:28:42,550
of novelty maybe that's why mathematics
mathematicians love

12782
03:28:42,550 --> 03:28:42,560
mathematicians love
 

12783
03:28:42,560 --> 03:28:44,630
mathematicians love
discovery but actually they are creating

12784
03:28:44,630 --> 03:28:44,640
discovery but actually they are creating
 

12785
03:28:44,640 --> 03:28:47,110
discovery but actually they are creating
and then when they create a new um

12786
03:28:47,110 --> 03:28:47,120
and then when they create a new um
 

12787
03:28:47,120 --> 03:28:49,190
and then when they create a new um
mathematical structure that they can

12788
03:28:49,190 --> 03:28:49,200
mathematical structure that they can
 

12789
03:28:49,200 --> 03:28:51,590
mathematical structure that they can
then they you can you can write code to

12790
03:28:51,590 --> 03:28:51,600
then they you can you can write code to
 

12791
03:28:51,600 --> 03:28:53,030
then they you can you can write code to
work out whether there's whether that

12792
03:28:53,030 --> 03:28:53,040
work out whether there's whether that
 

12793
03:28:53,040 --> 03:28:54,870
work out whether there's whether that
structure exists before that that's

12794
03:28:54,870 --> 03:28:54,880
structure exists before that that's
 

12795
03:28:54,880 --> 03:28:56,469
structure exists before that that's
almost why i would love to have been a

12796
03:28:56,469 --> 03:28:56,479
almost why i would love to have been a
 

12797
03:28:56,479 --> 03:28:58,389
almost why i would love to have been a
mathematician from that regard to invent

12798
03:28:58,389 --> 03:28:58,399
mathematician from that regard to invent
 

12799
03:28:58,399 --> 03:29:01,269
mathematician from that regard to invent
new math that really i know pretty much

12800
03:29:01,269 --> 03:29:01,279
new math that really i know pretty much
 

12801
03:29:01,279 --> 03:29:03,349
new math that really i know pretty much
for sure to not exit does not exist

12802
03:29:03,349 --> 03:29:03,359
for sure to not exit does not exist
 

12803
03:29:03,359 --> 03:29:04,550
for sure to not exit does not exist
anywhere else in the universe because so

12804
03:29:04,550 --> 03:29:04,560
anywhere else in the universe because so
 

12805
03:29:04,560 --> 03:29:07,269
anywhere else in the universe because so
contingent right but this gets into like

12806
03:29:07,269 --> 03:29:07,279
contingent right but this gets into like
 

12807
03:29:07,279 --> 03:29:08,870
contingent right but this gets into like
you are you said a few times but i still

12808
03:29:08,870 --> 03:29:08,880
you are you said a few times but i still
 

12809
03:29:08,880 --> 03:29:10,150
you are you said a few times but i still
really don't understand how you actually

12810
03:29:10,150 --> 03:29:10,160
really don't understand how you actually
 

12811
03:29:10,160 --> 03:29:12,469
really don't understand how you actually
plan to do this to build an experiment

12812
03:29:12,469 --> 03:29:12,479
plan to do this to build an experiment
 

12813
03:29:12,479 --> 03:29:13,990
plan to do this to build an experiment
that detects how the universe is

12814
03:29:13,990 --> 03:29:14,000
that detects how the universe is
 

12815
03:29:14,000 --> 03:29:15,510
that detects how the universe is
generating novelty or that time is the

12816
03:29:15,510 --> 03:29:15,520
generating novelty or that time is the
 

12817
03:29:15,520 --> 03:29:16,630
generating novelty or that time is the
mechanism

12818
03:29:16,630 --> 03:29:16,640
mechanism
 

12819
03:29:16,640 --> 03:29:18,950
mechanism
so the problem that we all have which i

12820
03:29:18,950 --> 03:29:18,960
so the problem that we all have which i
 

12821
03:29:18,960 --> 03:29:20,790
so the problem that we all have which i
think is what lex is pushing against is

12822
03:29:20,790 --> 03:29:20,800
think is what lex is pushing against is
 

12823
03:29:20,800 --> 03:29:22,950
think is what lex is pushing against is
if i built the experiment

12824
03:29:22,950 --> 03:29:22,960
if i built the experiment
 

12825
03:29:22,960 --> 03:29:24,790
if i built the experiment
you don't know what you put into it so

12826
03:29:24,790 --> 03:29:24,800
you don't know what you put into it so
 

12827
03:29:24,800 --> 03:29:26,150
you don't know what you put into it so
you don't know what

12828
03:29:26,150 --> 03:29:26,160
you don't know what
 

12829
03:29:26,160 --> 03:29:28,150
you don't know what
like if you unless you can quantify

12830
03:29:28,150 --> 03:29:28,160
like if you unless you can quantify
 

12831
03:29:28,160 --> 03:29:30,150
like if you unless you can quantify
everything you put in all of your agency

12832
03:29:30,150 --> 03:29:30,160
everything you put in all of your agency
 

12833
03:29:30,160 --> 03:29:32,229
everything you put in all of your agency
all the boundary conditions you don't

12834
03:29:32,229 --> 03:29:32,239
all the boundary conditions you don't
 

12835
03:29:32,239 --> 03:29:35,110
all the boundary conditions you don't
know if you somehow biased it in some

12836
03:29:35,110 --> 03:29:35,120
know if you somehow biased it in some
 

12837
03:29:35,120 --> 03:29:37,670
know if you somehow biased it in some
way so is the novelty actually intrinsic

12838
03:29:37,670 --> 03:29:37,680
way so is the novelty actually intrinsic
 

12839
03:29:37,680 --> 03:29:39,510
way so is the novelty actually intrinsic
to that experiment or to that robot or

12840
03:29:39,510 --> 03:29:39,520
to that experiment or to that robot or
 

12841
03:29:39,520 --> 03:29:40,950
to that experiment or to that robot or
is it something you gave it but you

12842
03:29:40,950 --> 03:29:40,960
is it something you gave it but you
 

12843
03:29:40,960 --> 03:29:42,710
is it something you gave it but you
didn't realize it's gonna be it's gonna

12844
03:29:42,710 --> 03:29:42,720
didn't realize it's gonna be it's gonna
 

12845
03:29:42,720 --> 03:29:44,469
didn't realize it's gonna be it's gonna
asymptote towards that right you're

12846
03:29:44,469 --> 03:29:44,479
asymptote towards that right you're
 

12847
03:29:44,479 --> 03:29:45,990
asymptote towards that right you're
never gonna know for sure but you can

12848
03:29:45,990 --> 03:29:46,000
never gonna know for sure but you can
 

12849
03:29:46,000 --> 03:29:47,910
never gonna know for sure but you can
start to take out you know you can use

12850
03:29:47,910 --> 03:29:47,920
start to take out you know you can use
 

12851
03:29:47,920 --> 03:29:50,630
start to take out you know you can use
good bayesian approaches and just keep

12852
03:29:50,630 --> 03:29:50,640
good bayesian approaches and just keep
 

12853
03:29:50,640 --> 03:29:52,630
good bayesian approaches and just keep
updating and updating and updating until

12854
03:29:52,630 --> 03:29:52,640
updating and updating and updating until
 

12855
03:29:52,640 --> 03:29:54,950
updating and updating and updating until
you point to one sense of purposes found

12856
03:29:54,950 --> 03:29:54,960
you point to one sense of purposes found
 

12857
03:29:54,960 --> 03:29:57,349
you point to one sense of purposes found
on how much novelty generation could be

12858
03:29:57,349 --> 03:29:57,359
on how much novelty generation could be
 

12859
03:29:57,359 --> 03:29:58,950
on how much novelty generation could be
yeah got it

12860
03:29:58,950 --> 03:29:58,960
yeah got it
 

12861
03:29:58,960 --> 03:30:01,269
yeah got it
so the ability generate novelty is

12862
03:30:01,269 --> 03:30:01,279
so the ability generate novelty is
 

12863
03:30:01,279 --> 03:30:03,590
so the ability generate novelty is
correlated with high assembly index

12864
03:30:03,590 --> 03:30:03,600
correlated with high assembly index
 

12865
03:30:03,600 --> 03:30:07,510
correlated with high assembly index
with assembly index yeah and yeah

12866
03:30:07,510 --> 03:30:07,520

 

12867
03:30:07,520 --> 03:30:08,870

because the space possibilities is

12868
03:30:08,870 --> 03:30:08,880
because the space possibilities is
 

12869
03:30:08,880 --> 03:30:11,429
because the space possibilities is
bigger

12870
03:30:11,429 --> 03:30:11,439

 

12871
03:30:11,439 --> 03:30:13,030

so

12872
03:30:13,030 --> 03:30:13,040
so
 

12873
03:30:13,040 --> 03:30:15,429
so
um that's the key this could be a good

12874
03:30:15,429 --> 03:30:15,439
um that's the key this could be a good
 

12875
03:30:15,439 --> 03:30:17,990
um that's the key this could be a good
so a running joke of like why lex is

12876
03:30:17,990 --> 03:30:18,000
so a running joke of like why lex is
 

12877
03:30:18,000 --> 03:30:21,990
so a running joke of like why lex is
single this could be a good part for

12878
03:30:21,990 --> 03:30:22,000
single this could be a good part for
 

12879
03:30:22,000 --> 03:30:24,630
single this could be a good part for
uh so so what you're looking for

12880
03:30:24,630 --> 03:30:24,640
uh so so what you're looking for
 

12881
03:30:24,640 --> 03:30:27,269
uh so so what you're looking for
in a robot partner is ability to

12882
03:30:27,269 --> 03:30:27,279
in a robot partner is ability to
 

12883
03:30:27,279 --> 03:30:33,429
in a robot partner is ability to
generate novelty

12884
03:30:33,429 --> 03:30:33,439

 

12885
03:30:33,439 --> 03:30:35,269

and that's i suppose you would say it's

12886
03:30:35,269 --> 03:30:35,279
and that's i suppose you would say it's
 

12887
03:30:35,279 --> 03:30:40,550
and that's i suppose you would say it's
a good definition of intelligence too

12888
03:30:40,550 --> 03:30:40,560

 

12889
03:30:40,560 --> 03:30:44,710

boy is novelty a um

12890
03:30:44,710 --> 03:30:44,720
boy is novelty a um
 

12891
03:30:44,720 --> 03:30:47,429
boy is novelty a um
a fuzzy concept

12892
03:30:47,429 --> 03:30:47,439
a fuzzy concept
 

12893
03:30:47,439 --> 03:30:49,910
a fuzzy concept
is creativity better

12894
03:30:49,910 --> 03:30:49,920
is creativity better
 

12895
03:30:49,920 --> 03:30:52,870
is creativity better
yeah i mean that's all pretty fuzzy

12896
03:30:52,870 --> 03:30:52,880
yeah i mean that's all pretty fuzzy
 

12897
03:30:52,880 --> 03:30:54,950
yeah i mean that's all pretty fuzzy
it's kind of the same maybe that's why

12898
03:30:54,950 --> 03:30:54,960
it's kind of the same maybe that's why
 

12899
03:30:54,960 --> 03:30:56,550
it's kind of the same maybe that's why
aliens haven't come yet it's because

12900
03:30:56,550 --> 03:30:56,560
aliens haven't come yet it's because
 

12901
03:30:56,560 --> 03:30:58,070
aliens haven't come yet it's because
we're not creating enough novelty like

12902
03:30:58,070 --> 03:30:58,080
we're not creating enough novelty like
 

12903
03:30:58,080 --> 03:31:00,150
we're not creating enough novelty like
there's some kind of a hierarchy of

12904
03:31:00,150 --> 03:31:00,160
there's some kind of a hierarchy of
 

12905
03:31:00,160 --> 03:31:01,670
there's some kind of a hierarchy of
novelty in the universe well i think

12906
03:31:01,670 --> 03:31:01,680
novelty in the universe well i think
 

12907
03:31:01,680 --> 03:31:03,990
novelty in the universe well i think
novelties like things surprise you right

12908
03:31:03,990 --> 03:31:04,000
novelties like things surprise you right
 

12909
03:31:04,000 --> 03:31:05,670
novelties like things surprise you right
so it's a very passive thing but i guess

12910
03:31:05,670 --> 03:31:05,680
so it's a very passive thing but i guess
 

12911
03:31:05,680 --> 03:31:07,670
so it's a very passive thing but i guess
i would remember by saying creativity is

12912
03:31:07,670 --> 03:31:07,680
i would remember by saying creativity is
 

12913
03:31:07,680 --> 03:31:09,030
i would remember by saying creativity is
i think it's much more active like you

12914
03:31:09,030 --> 03:31:09,040
i think it's much more active like you
 

12915
03:31:09,040 --> 03:31:10,950
i think it's much more active like you
think there's like a mechanism

12916
03:31:10,950 --> 03:31:10,960
think there's like a mechanism
 

12917
03:31:10,960 --> 03:31:12,309
think there's like a mechanism
of like the things that exist are

12918
03:31:12,309 --> 03:31:12,319
of like the things that exist are
 

12919
03:31:12,319 --> 03:31:14,469
of like the things that exist are
generating the creativity novelty seems

12920
03:31:14,469 --> 03:31:14,479
generating the creativity novelty seems
 

12921
03:31:14,479 --> 03:31:15,750
generating the creativity novelty seems
to be there's some spontaneous

12922
03:31:15,750 --> 03:31:15,760
to be there's some spontaneous
 

12923
03:31:15,760 --> 03:31:17,429
to be there's some spontaneous
production it has it's completely

12924
03:31:17,429 --> 03:31:17,439
production it has it's completely
 

12925
03:31:17,439 --> 03:31:19,110
production it has it's completely
decoupled from the things that exist no

12926
03:31:19,110 --> 03:31:19,120
decoupled from the things that exist no
 

12927
03:31:19,120 --> 03:31:21,349
decoupled from the things that exist no
i i understand i think there's this

12928
03:31:21,349 --> 03:31:21,359
i i understand i think there's this
 

12929
03:31:21,359 --> 03:31:23,030
i i understand i think there's this
really really creativity is the

12930
03:31:23,030 --> 03:31:23,040
really really creativity is the
 

12931
03:31:23,040 --> 03:31:26,070
really really creativity is the
mechanism and novelty is the observable

12932
03:31:26,070 --> 03:31:26,080
mechanism and novelty is the observable
 

12933
03:31:26,080 --> 03:31:27,030
mechanism and novelty is the observable
yeah

12934
03:31:27,030 --> 03:31:27,040
yeah
 

12935
03:31:27,040 --> 03:31:28,870
yeah
novelty could just be surprising your

12936
03:31:28,870 --> 03:31:28,880
novelty could just be surprising your
 

12937
03:31:28,880 --> 03:31:31,670
novelty could just be surprising your
model of the world was broken and and

12938
03:31:31,670 --> 03:31:31,680
model of the world was broken and and
 

12939
03:31:31,680 --> 03:31:33,429
model of the world was broken and and
not necessarily in a positive way that's

12940
03:31:33,429 --> 03:31:33,439
not necessarily in a positive way that's
 

12941
03:31:33,439 --> 03:31:34,870
not necessarily in a positive way that's
the prize so there's three things now

12942
03:31:34,870 --> 03:31:34,880
the prize so there's three things now
 

12943
03:31:34,880 --> 03:31:36,229
the prize so there's three things now
let's go back that's cool right let's go

12944
03:31:36,229 --> 03:31:36,239
let's go back that's cool right let's go
 

12945
03:31:36,239 --> 03:31:38,790
let's go back that's cool right let's go
you've got surprise which is basically

12946
03:31:38,790 --> 03:31:38,800
you've got surprise which is basically
 

12947
03:31:38,800 --> 03:31:40,630
you've got surprise which is basically
i'm i don't i mean i'm surprised all the

12948
03:31:40,630 --> 03:31:40,640
i'm i don't i mean i'm surprised all the
 

12949
03:31:40,640 --> 03:31:41,910
i'm i don't i mean i'm surprised all the
time because i don't read very much i'm

12950
03:31:41,910 --> 03:31:41,920
time because i don't read very much i'm
 

12951
03:31:41,920 --> 03:31:43,910
time because i don't read very much i'm
pretty dumb i was like oh wow

12952
03:31:43,910 --> 03:31:43,920
pretty dumb i was like oh wow
 

12953
03:31:43,920 --> 03:31:45,750
pretty dumb i was like oh wow
i often used to invent new scientific

12954
03:31:45,750 --> 03:31:45,760
i often used to invent new scientific
 

12955
03:31:45,760 --> 03:31:47,510
i often used to invent new scientific
you know ideas and i was really

12956
03:31:47,510 --> 03:31:47,520
you know ideas and i was really
 

12957
03:31:47,520 --> 03:31:48,950
you know ideas and i was really
surprised by that and then when looking

12958
03:31:48,950 --> 03:31:48,960
surprised by that and then when looking
 

12959
03:31:48,960 --> 03:31:50,150
surprised by that and then when looking
literature properly and it's there so

12960
03:31:50,150 --> 03:31:50,160
literature properly and it's there so
 

12961
03:31:50,160 --> 03:31:52,309
literature properly and it's there so
surprise that's to the extent that you

12962
03:31:52,309 --> 03:31:52,319
surprise that's to the extent that you
 

12963
03:31:52,319 --> 03:31:54,550
surprise that's to the extent that you
don't have full information

12964
03:31:54,550 --> 03:31:54,560
don't have full information
 

12965
03:31:54,560 --> 03:31:58,630
don't have full information
um creativity the act of pushing

12966
03:31:58,630 --> 03:31:58,640
um creativity the act of pushing
 

12967
03:31:58,640 --> 03:32:01,190
um creativity the act of pushing
on that um kind of on the causal

12968
03:32:01,190 --> 03:32:01,200
on that um kind of on the causal
 

12969
03:32:01,200 --> 03:32:02,309
on that um kind of on the causal
structure

12970
03:32:02,309 --> 03:32:02,319
structure
 

12971
03:32:02,319 --> 03:32:04,630
structure
and novelty which is measuring that

12972
03:32:04,630 --> 03:32:04,640
and novelty which is measuring that
 

12973
03:32:04,640 --> 03:32:05,670
and novelty which is measuring that
degree

12974
03:32:05,670 --> 03:32:05,680
degree
 

12975
03:32:05,680 --> 03:32:07,750
degree
right so i think that's pretty well

12976
03:32:07,750 --> 03:32:07,760
right so i think that's pretty well
 

12977
03:32:07,760 --> 03:32:09,990
right so i think that's pretty well
defined in that regard so you want your

12978
03:32:09,990 --> 03:32:10,000
defined in that regard so you want your
 

12979
03:32:10,000 --> 03:32:11,750
defined in that regard so you want your
robo you mean in the and in the end

12980
03:32:11,750 --> 03:32:11,760
robo you mean in the and in the end
 

12981
03:32:11,760 --> 03:32:13,429
robo you mean in the and in the end
that's why actually the way the internet

12982
03:32:13,429 --> 03:32:13,439
that's why actually the way the internet
 

12983
03:32:13,439 --> 03:32:15,510
that's why actually the way the internet
and the printing press share

12984
03:32:15,510 --> 03:32:15,520
and the printing press share
 

12985
03:32:15,520 --> 03:32:17,830
and the printing press share
some um i actually think creativity has

12986
03:32:17,830 --> 03:32:17,840
some um i actually think creativity has
 

12987
03:32:17,840 --> 03:32:19,510
some um i actually think creativity has
dropped a bit since it created since the

12988
03:32:19,510 --> 03:32:19,520
dropped a bit since it created since the
 

12989
03:32:19,520 --> 03:32:21,190
dropped a bit since it created since the
internet because everyone's just just

12990
03:32:21,190 --> 03:32:21,200
internet because everyone's just just
 

12991
03:32:21,200 --> 03:32:23,429
internet because everyone's just just
you know just regurgitating stuff but of

12992
03:32:23,429 --> 03:32:23,439
you know just regurgitating stuff but of
 

12993
03:32:23,439 --> 03:32:25,349
you know just regurgitating stuff but of
course now it's beginning to accelerate

12994
03:32:25,349 --> 03:32:25,359
course now it's beginning to accelerate
 

12995
03:32:25,359 --> 03:32:27,030
course now it's beginning to accelerate
again because everyone is using this

12996
03:32:27,030 --> 03:32:27,040
again because everyone is using this
 

12997
03:32:27,040 --> 03:32:28,630
again because everyone is using this
tool to be creative

12998
03:32:28,630 --> 03:32:28,640
tool to be creative
 

12999
03:32:28,640 --> 03:32:31,030
tool to be creative
and boom is exploding

13000
03:32:31,030 --> 03:32:31,040
and boom is exploding
 

13001
03:32:31,040 --> 03:32:32,309
and boom is exploding
so i think that's what happens when you

13002
03:32:32,309 --> 03:32:32,319
so i think that's what happens when you
 

13003
03:32:32,319 --> 03:32:34,550
so i think that's what happens when you
create these new technologies

13004
03:32:34,550 --> 03:32:34,560
create these new technologies
 

13005
03:32:34,560 --> 03:32:35,830
create these new technologies
that's really that's really helpful

13006
03:32:35,830 --> 03:32:35,840
that's really that's really helpful
 

13007
03:32:35,840 --> 03:32:37,429
that's really that's really helpful
there's a difference between novelty and

13008
03:32:37,429 --> 03:32:37,439
there's a difference between novelty and
 

13009
03:32:37,439 --> 03:32:39,349
there's a difference between novelty and
surprise okay i was i think i was

13010
03:32:39,349 --> 03:32:39,359
surprise okay i was i think i was
 

13011
03:32:39,359 --> 03:32:40,870
surprise okay i was i think i was
thinking about surprise

13012
03:32:40,870 --> 03:32:40,880
thinking about surprise
 

13013
03:32:40,880 --> 03:32:42,550
thinking about surprise
if you give me a toy that surprises me

13014
03:32:42,550 --> 03:32:42,560
if you give me a toy that surprises me
 

13015
03:32:42,560 --> 03:32:44,469
if you give me a toy that surprises me
for a bit it'd be great robot surprises

13016
03:32:44,469 --> 03:32:44,479
for a bit it'd be great robot surprises
 

13017
03:32:44,479 --> 03:32:46,630
for a bit it'd be great robot surprises
me you know experiment that surprises

13018
03:32:46,630 --> 03:32:46,640
me you know experiment that surprises
 

13019
03:32:46,640 --> 03:32:47,910
me you know experiment that surprises
you yeah i mean that's why i love doing

13020
03:32:47,910 --> 03:32:47,920
you yeah i mean that's why i love doing
 

13021
03:32:47,920 --> 03:32:49,510
you yeah i mean that's why i love doing
experiments because i'm i can't it's

13022
03:32:49,510 --> 03:32:49,520
experiments because i'm i can't it's
 

13023
03:32:49,520 --> 03:32:51,830
experiments because i'm i can't it's
still exciting yeah surprise is exciting

13024
03:32:51,830 --> 03:32:51,840
still exciting yeah surprise is exciting
 

13025
03:32:51,840 --> 03:32:52,950
still exciting yeah surprise is exciting
yeah

13026
03:32:52,950 --> 03:32:52,960
yeah
 

13027
03:32:52,960 --> 03:32:54,630
yeah
even negative surprise like some people

13028
03:32:54,630 --> 03:32:54,640
even negative surprise like some people
 

13029
03:32:54,640 --> 03:32:57,990
even negative surprise like some people
love drama in relationships like

13030
03:32:57,990 --> 03:32:58,000
love drama in relationships like
 

13031
03:32:58,000 --> 03:32:59,750
love drama in relationships like
it's like why the hell

13032
03:32:59,750 --> 03:32:59,760
it's like why the hell
 

13033
03:32:59,760 --> 03:33:01,190
it's like why the hell
why'd you do this

13034
03:33:01,190 --> 03:33:01,200
why'd you do this
 

13035
03:33:01,200 --> 03:33:03,110
why'd you do this
that could be exciting i could imagine

13036
03:33:03,110 --> 03:33:03,120
that could be exciting i could imagine
 

13037
03:33:03,120 --> 03:33:04,790
that could be exciting i could imagine
companies selling updates to their their

13038
03:33:04,790 --> 03:33:04,800
companies selling updates to their their
 

13039
03:33:04,800 --> 03:33:06,870
companies selling updates to their their
companion robots that just basically

13040
03:33:06,870 --> 03:33:06,880
companion robots that just basically
 

13041
03:33:06,880 --> 03:33:08,790
companion robots that just basically
generate negative surprise just to just

13042
03:33:08,790 --> 03:33:08,800
generate negative surprise just to just
 

13043
03:33:08,800 --> 03:33:10,950
generate negative surprise just to just
spice things up a bit yeah it's the push

13044
03:33:10,950 --> 03:33:10,960
spice things up a bit yeah it's the push
 

13045
03:33:10,960 --> 03:33:12,389
spice things up a bit yeah it's the push
and pull that's that's one of the

13046
03:33:12,389 --> 03:33:12,399
and pull that's that's one of the
 

13047
03:33:12,399 --> 03:33:14,790
and pull that's that's one of the
components of love as you said love is a

13048
03:33:14,790 --> 03:33:14,800
components of love as you said love is a
 

13049
03:33:14,800 --> 03:33:16,389
components of love as you said love is a
complicated thing

13050
03:33:16,389 --> 03:33:16,399
complicated thing
 

13051
03:33:16,399 --> 03:33:18,309
complicated thing
oh beauty i wanted to mention this

13052
03:33:18,309 --> 03:33:18,319
oh beauty i wanted to mention this
 

13053
03:33:18,319 --> 03:33:20,150
oh beauty i wanted to mention this
because you also tweeted i think this

13054
03:33:20,150 --> 03:33:20,160
because you also tweeted i think this
 

13055
03:33:20,160 --> 03:33:22,150
because you also tweeted i think this
was sarah no it might have been lee i

13056
03:33:22,150 --> 03:33:22,160
was sarah no it might have been lee i
 

13057
03:33:22,160 --> 03:33:23,830
was sarah no it might have been lee i
don't remember but it was a survey

13058
03:33:23,830 --> 03:33:23,840
don't remember but it was a survey
 

13059
03:33:23,840 --> 03:33:25,429
don't remember but it was a survey
published in nature showing that

13060
03:33:25,429 --> 03:33:25,439
published in nature showing that
 

13061
03:33:25,439 --> 03:33:28,790
published in nature showing that
scientists uh find yeah yeah um

13062
03:33:28,790 --> 03:33:28,800
scientists uh find yeah yeah um
 

13063
03:33:28,800 --> 03:33:31,910
scientists uh find yeah yeah um
anyway there's a there's a plot this is

13064
03:33:31,910 --> 03:33:31,920
anyway there's a there's a plot this is
 

13065
03:33:31,920 --> 03:33:34,950
anyway there's a there's a plot this is
published in nature of what scientists

13066
03:33:34,950 --> 03:33:34,960
published in nature of what scientists
 

13067
03:33:34,960 --> 03:33:36,870
published in nature of what scientists
find beautiful in their work and it

13068
03:33:36,870 --> 03:33:36,880
find beautiful in their work and it
 

13069
03:33:36,880 --> 03:33:39,190
find beautiful in their work and it
separates biologists and physicists it'd

13070
03:33:39,190 --> 03:33:39,200
separates biologists and physicists it'd
 

13071
03:33:39,200 --> 03:33:41,670
separates biologists and physicists it'd
be nice if you showed the full plot

13072
03:33:41,670 --> 03:33:41,680
be nice if you showed the full plot
 

13073
03:33:41,680 --> 03:33:43,830
be nice if you showed the full plot
and there's simplicity elegance hidden

13074
03:33:43,830 --> 03:33:43,840
and there's simplicity elegance hidden
 

13075
03:33:43,840 --> 03:33:45,349
and there's simplicity elegance hidden

13080
03:33:49,910 --> 03:33:49,920
complexity harmony and so on um is there
 

13081
03:33:49,920 --> 03:33:52,070
complexity harmony and so on um is there
any interesting things that stand out to

13082
03:33:52,070 --> 03:33:52,080
any interesting things that stand out to
 

13083
03:33:52,080 --> 03:33:52,950
any interesting things that stand out to
you

13084
03:33:52,950 --> 03:33:52,960
you
 

13085
03:33:52,960 --> 03:33:55,030
you
i think the fact that biologists like

13086
03:33:55,030 --> 03:33:55,040
i think the fact that biologists like
 

13087
03:33:55,040 --> 03:33:59,030
i think the fact that biologists like
complexity and pleasing colors

13088
03:33:59,030 --> 03:33:59,040
complexity and pleasing colors
 

13089
03:33:59,040 --> 03:34:00,550
complexity and pleasing colors
oh there's pleasing calls on there yeah

13090
03:34:00,550 --> 03:34:00,560
oh there's pleasing calls on there yeah
 

13091
03:34:00,560 --> 03:34:02,550
oh there's pleasing calls on there yeah
yeah yeah yeah or shape or shapes

13092
03:34:02,550 --> 03:34:02,560
yeah yeah yeah or shape or shapes
 

13093
03:34:02,560 --> 03:34:03,429
yeah yeah yeah or shape or shapes
pleasing

13094
03:34:03,429 --> 03:34:03,439

13095
03:34:03,439 --> 03:34:05,349

and then physicists obviously love

13096
03:34:05,349 --> 03:34:05,359
and then physicists obviously love
 

13097
03:34:05,359 --> 03:34:06,469
and then physicists obviously love
simplicity

13098
03:34:06,469 --> 03:34:06,479

simplicity elegance yeah they love

13102
03:34:10,150 --> 03:34:10,160
simplicity elegance yeah they love
 

13103
03:34:10,160 --> 03:34:12,550
simplicity elegance yeah they love
symmetry and then biologists love

13104
03:34:12,550 --> 03:34:12,560
symmetry and then biologists love
 

13105
03:34:12,560 --> 03:34:14,550

complexity
 

13107
03:34:14,560 --> 03:34:16,870
complexity
and uh well they just love a little bit

13108
03:34:16,870 --> 03:34:16,880
and uh well they just love a little bit
 

13109
03:34:16,880 --> 03:34:17,750
and uh well they just love a little bit
less

13110
03:34:17,750 --> 03:34:17,760
less
 

13111
03:34:17,760 --> 03:34:19,269
less
they love everything a little bit less

13112
03:34:19,269 --> 03:34:19,279
they love everything a little bit less
 

13113
03:34:19,279 --> 03:34:20,950
they love everything a little bit less
the complexity a little bit more a

13114
03:34:20,950 --> 03:34:20,960
the complexity a little bit more a
 

13115
03:34:20,960 --> 03:34:22,150
the complexity a little bit more a
little bit more

13116
03:34:22,150 --> 03:34:22,160
little bit more
 

13117
03:34:22,160 --> 03:34:23,590
little bit more
that's so interesting and pleasing

13118
03:34:23,590 --> 03:34:23,600
that's so interesting and pleasing
 

13119
03:34:23,600 --> 03:34:25,110
that's so interesting and pleasing
colors are shapes

13120
03:34:25,110 --> 03:34:25,120
colors are shapes
 

13121
03:34:25,120 --> 03:34:26,790
colors are shapes
do you think it's a useful i forget what

13122
03:34:26,790 --> 03:34:26,800
do you think it's a useful i forget what
 

13123
03:34:26,800 --> 03:34:28,389
do you think it's a useful i forget what
your tweet was that this is missing some

13124
03:34:28,389 --> 03:34:28,399
your tweet was that this is missing some
 

13125
03:34:28,399 --> 03:34:30,550
your tweet was that this is missing some
of the things oh no i think i it's

13126
03:34:30,550 --> 03:34:30,560
of the things oh no i think i it's
 

13127
03:34:30,560 --> 03:34:32,630
of the things oh no i think i it's
because i think about how

13128
03:34:32,630 --> 03:34:32,640
because i think about how
 

13129
03:34:32,640 --> 03:34:33,750
because i think about how
um

13130
03:34:33,750 --> 03:34:33,760
um
 

13131
03:34:33,760 --> 03:34:36,389
um
explanations become causal to our future

13132
03:34:36,389 --> 03:34:36,399
explanations become causal to our future
 

13133
03:34:36,399 --> 03:34:37,429
explanations become causal to our future
so

13134
03:34:37,429 --> 03:34:37,439
so
 

13135
03:34:37,439 --> 03:34:40,630
so
i have this whole philosophy that um

13136
03:34:40,630 --> 03:34:40,640
i have this whole philosophy that um
 

13137
03:34:40,640 --> 03:34:42,710
i have this whole philosophy that um
the theories we build and the way we

13138
03:34:42,710 --> 03:34:42,720
the theories we build and the way we
 

13139
03:34:42,720 --> 03:34:45,670
the theories we build and the way we
describe reality should be

13140
03:34:45,670 --> 03:34:45,680
describe reality should be
 

13141
03:34:45,680 --> 03:34:48,070
describe reality should be
have the largest

13142
03:34:48,070 --> 03:34:48,080
have the largest
 

13143
03:34:48,080 --> 03:34:50,070
have the largest
breadth of possibilities for the future

13144
03:34:50,070 --> 03:34:50,080
breadth of possibilities for the future
 

13145
03:34:50,080 --> 03:34:51,190
breadth of possibilities for the future
of

13146
03:34:51,190 --> 03:34:51,200
of
 

13147
03:34:51,200 --> 03:34:53,670
of
what we can accomplish so in some sense

13148
03:34:53,670 --> 03:34:53,680
what we can accomplish so in some sense
 

13149
03:34:53,680 --> 03:34:54,950
what we can accomplish so in some sense
it's not like

13150
03:34:54,950 --> 03:34:54,960
it's not like
 

13151
03:34:54,960 --> 03:34:56,950
it's not like
occam's razor is not for simplicity it's

13152
03:34:56,950 --> 03:34:56,960
occam's razor is not for simplicity it's
 

13153
03:34:56,960 --> 03:34:58,870
occam's razor is not for simplicity it's
for optimism or the kind of future you

13154
03:34:58,870 --> 03:34:58,880
for optimism or the kind of future you
 

13155
03:34:58,880 --> 03:34:59,910
for optimism or the kind of future you
can build

13156
03:34:59,910 --> 03:34:59,920
can build
 

13157
03:34:59,920 --> 03:35:02,389
can build
and so i think um

13158
03:35:02,389 --> 03:35:02,399
and so i think um
 

13159
03:35:02,399 --> 03:35:03,590
and so i think um
i think you have to think this way when

13160
03:35:03,590 --> 03:35:03,600
i think you have to think this way when
 

13161
03:35:03,600 --> 03:35:05,429
i think you have to think this way when
you're thinking about life and alien

13162
03:35:05,429 --> 03:35:05,439
you're thinking about life and alien
 

13163
03:35:05,439 --> 03:35:06,950
you're thinking about life and alien
life because ultimately we're trying to

13164
03:35:06,950 --> 03:35:06,960
life because ultimately we're trying to
 

13165
03:35:06,960 --> 03:35:09,110
life because ultimately we're trying to
build i mean science is just basically

13166
03:35:09,110 --> 03:35:09,120
build i mean science is just basically
 

13167
03:35:09,120 --> 03:35:11,110
build i mean science is just basically
our narratives about reality and now

13168
03:35:11,110 --> 03:35:11,120
our narratives about reality and now
 

13169
03:35:11,120 --> 03:35:12,630
our narratives about reality and now
you're building a narrative that is what

13170
03:35:12,630 --> 03:35:12,640
you're building a narrative that is what
 

13171
03:35:12,640 --> 03:35:14,469
you're building a narrative that is what
we are as physical systems it seems to

13172
03:35:14,469 --> 03:35:14,479
we are as physical systems it seems to
 

13173
03:35:14,479 --> 03:35:15,750
we are as physical systems it seems to
me it needs to be as positive as

13174
03:35:15,750 --> 03:35:15,760
me it needs to be as positive as
 

13175
03:35:15,760 --> 03:35:17,349
me it needs to be as positive as
possible because it's basically going to

13176
03:35:17,349 --> 03:35:17,359
possible because it's basically going to
 

13177
03:35:17,359 --> 03:35:19,349
possible because it's basically going to
shape the future trajectory where we're

13178
03:35:19,349 --> 03:35:19,359
shape the future trajectory where we're
 

13179
03:35:19,359 --> 03:35:20,790
shape the future trajectory where we're
going and we don't use that as a

13180
03:35:20,790 --> 03:35:20,800
going and we don't use that as a
 

13181
03:35:20,800 --> 03:35:22,630
going and we don't use that as a
heuristic in theory building because we

13182
03:35:22,630 --> 03:35:22,640
heuristic in theory building because we
 

13183
03:35:22,640 --> 03:35:25,510
heuristic in theory building because we
think theories um

13184
03:35:25,510 --> 03:35:25,520
think theories um
 

13185
03:35:25,520 --> 03:35:27,110
think theories um
are about predicting features of the

13186
03:35:27,110 --> 03:35:27,120
are about predicting features of the
 

13187
03:35:27,120 --> 03:35:29,110
are about predicting features of the
world not causing them but if you look

13188
03:35:29,110 --> 03:35:29,120
world not causing them but if you look
 

13189
03:35:29,120 --> 03:35:30,550
world not causing them but if you look
at the history of all of the development

13190
03:35:30,550 --> 03:35:30,560
at the history of all of the development
 

13191
03:35:30,560 --> 03:35:32,150
at the history of all of the development
of human thought it's caused the things

13192
03:35:32,150 --> 03:35:32,160
of human thought it's caused the things
 

13193
03:35:32,160 --> 03:35:33,910
of human thought it's caused the things
that happen next so

13194
03:35:33,910 --> 03:35:33,920
that happen next so
 

13195
03:35:33,920 --> 03:35:35,349
that happen next so
it's not just about looking at the world

13196
03:35:35,349 --> 03:35:35,359
it's not just about looking at the world
 

13197
03:35:35,359 --> 03:35:37,349
it's not just about looking at the world
and observing it it's about

13198
03:35:37,349 --> 03:35:37,359
and observing it it's about
 

13199
03:35:37,359 --> 03:35:38,389
and observing it it's about
actually

13200
03:35:38,389 --> 03:35:38,399
actually
 

13201
03:35:38,399 --> 03:35:40,389
actually
that feedback loop

13202
03:35:40,389 --> 03:35:40,399
that feedback loop
 

13203
03:35:40,399 --> 03:35:42,469
that feedback loop
that's missing and it's not in any of

13204
03:35:42,469 --> 03:35:42,479
that's missing and it's not in any of
 

13205
03:35:42,479 --> 03:35:46,150
that's missing and it's not in any of
those categories

13206
03:35:46,150 --> 03:35:46,160

 

13207
03:35:46,160 --> 03:35:48,309

what do you think

13208
03:35:48,309 --> 03:35:48,319
what do you think
 

13209
03:35:48,319 --> 03:35:50,790
what do you think
is the most beautiful idea

13210
03:35:50,790 --> 03:35:50,800
is the most beautiful idea
 

13211
03:35:50,800 --> 03:35:53,429
is the most beautiful idea
in the physics of life and the chemistry

13212
03:35:53,429 --> 03:35:53,439
in the physics of life and the chemistry
 

13213
03:35:53,439 --> 03:35:54,710
in the physics of life and the chemistry
of life

13214
03:35:54,710 --> 03:35:54,720
of life
 

13215
03:35:54,720 --> 03:35:57,269
of life
in this um through all your exploration

13216
03:35:57,269 --> 03:35:57,279
in this um through all your exploration
 

13217
03:35:57,279 --> 03:36:00,389
in this um through all your exploration
with assembly theory

13218
03:36:00,389 --> 03:36:00,399

 

13219
03:36:00,399 --> 03:36:03,269

what is the um

13220
03:36:03,269 --> 03:36:03,279
what is the um
 

13221
03:36:03,279 --> 03:36:04,950
what is the um
the thing that made you step back and

13222
03:36:04,950 --> 03:36:04,960
the thing that made you step back and
 

13223
03:36:04,960 --> 03:36:07,590
the thing that made you step back and
say this is this this um

13224
03:36:07,590 --> 03:36:07,600
say this is this this um
 

13225
03:36:07,600 --> 03:36:09,190
say this is this this um
idea is beautiful

13226
03:36:09,190 --> 03:36:09,200
idea is beautiful
 

13227
03:36:09,200 --> 03:36:11,590
idea is beautiful
or potentially beautiful

13228
03:36:11,590 --> 03:36:11,600
or potentially beautiful
 

13229
03:36:11,600 --> 03:36:13,349
or potentially beautiful
for me it's that the universe is a

13230
03:36:13,349 --> 03:36:13,359
for me it's that the universe is a
 

13231
03:36:13,359 --> 03:36:15,830
for me it's that the universe is a
creative place i guess i i

13232
03:36:15,830 --> 03:36:15,840
creative place i guess i i
 

13233
03:36:15,840 --> 03:36:17,670
creative place i guess i i
i want to think and whether it's true or

13234
03:36:17,670 --> 03:36:17,680
i want to think and whether it's true or
 

13235
03:36:17,680 --> 03:36:19,190
i want to think and whether it's true or
not is that

13236
03:36:19,190 --> 03:36:19,200
not is that
 

13237
03:36:19,200 --> 03:36:21,429
not is that
we are special in some way and it's not

13238
03:36:21,429 --> 03:36:21,439
we are special in some way and it's not
 

13239
03:36:21,439 --> 03:36:23,349
we are special in some way and it's not
like an arbitrary

13240
03:36:23,349 --> 03:36:23,359
like an arbitrary
 

13241
03:36:23,359 --> 03:36:25,590
like an arbitrary
added on epi phenomena or ad hoc feature

13242
03:36:25,590 --> 03:36:25,600
added on epi phenomena or ad hoc feature
 

13243
03:36:25,600 --> 03:36:27,030
added on epi phenomena or ad hoc feature
of the universe that we exist but it's

13244
03:36:27,030 --> 03:36:27,040
of the universe that we exist but it's
 

13245
03:36:27,040 --> 03:36:28,710
of the universe that we exist but it's
something deep and intrinsic to the

13246
03:36:28,710 --> 03:36:28,720
something deep and intrinsic to the
 

13247
03:36:28,720 --> 03:36:30,309
something deep and intrinsic to the
structure of reality

13248
03:36:30,309 --> 03:36:30,319
structure of reality
 

13249
03:36:30,319 --> 03:36:32,229
structure of reality
um and to me the most beautiful ideas

13250
03:36:32,229 --> 03:36:32,239
um and to me the most beautiful ideas
 

13251
03:36:32,239 --> 03:36:34,469
um and to me the most beautiful ideas
that come out of that is that the the

13252
03:36:34,469 --> 03:36:34,479
that come out of that is that the the
 

13253
03:36:34,479 --> 03:36:37,190
that come out of that is that the the
reason we exist is for the universe

13254
03:36:37,190 --> 03:36:37,200
reason we exist is for the universe
 

13255
03:36:37,200 --> 03:36:39,590
reason we exist is for the universe
to generate more things and to think

13256
03:36:39,590 --> 03:36:39,600
to generate more things and to think
 

13257
03:36:39,600 --> 03:36:42,150
to generate more things and to think
about itself and use that as a

13258
03:36:42,150 --> 03:36:42,160
about itself and use that as a
 

13259
03:36:42,160 --> 03:36:45,990
about itself and use that as a
mechanism for creating more stuff

13260
03:36:45,990 --> 03:36:46,000
mechanism for creating more stuff
 

13261
03:36:46,000 --> 03:36:46,950
mechanism for creating more stuff
um

13262
03:36:46,950 --> 03:36:46,960
um
 

13263
03:36:46,960 --> 03:36:49,990
um
that's for me uh so like the the life

13264
03:36:49,990 --> 03:36:50,000
that's for me uh so like the the life
 

13265
03:36:50,000 --> 03:36:50,870
that's for me uh so like the the life
that

13266
03:36:50,870 --> 03:36:50,880
that
 

13267
03:36:50,880 --> 03:36:54,150
that
this however uh common it is is an

13268
03:36:54,150 --> 03:36:54,160
this however uh common it is is an
 

13269
03:36:54,160 --> 03:36:55,750
this however uh common it is is an
intrinsic part

13270
03:36:55,750 --> 03:36:55,760
intrinsic part
 

13271
03:36:55,760 --> 03:36:58,389
intrinsic part
as a fundamental part of uh this

13272
03:36:58,389 --> 03:36:58,399
as a fundamental part of uh this
 

13273
03:36:58,399 --> 03:36:59,910
as a fundamental part of uh this
universe at least that we live in i

13274
03:36:59,910 --> 03:36:59,920
universe at least that we live in i
 

13275
03:36:59,920 --> 03:37:01,590
universe at least that we live in i
think so i mean it's always interesting

13276
03:37:01,590 --> 03:37:01,600
think so i mean it's always interesting
 

13277
03:37:01,600 --> 03:37:03,590
think so i mean it's always interesting
to me because um

13278
03:37:03,590 --> 03:37:03,600
to me because um
 

13279
03:37:03,600 --> 03:37:04,950
to me because um
you know like we have theories of

13280
03:37:04,950 --> 03:37:04,960
you know like we have theories of
 

13281
03:37:04,960 --> 03:37:06,630
you know like we have theories of
quantum mechanics and gravity and

13282
03:37:06,630 --> 03:37:06,640
quantum mechanics and gravity and
 

13283
03:37:06,640 --> 03:37:07,990
quantum mechanics and gravity and
they're supposed to be like our most

13284
03:37:07,990 --> 03:37:08,000
they're supposed to be like our most
 

13285
03:37:08,000 --> 03:37:09,830
they're supposed to be like our most
fundamental theories right now and they

13286
03:37:09,830 --> 03:37:09,840
fundamental theories right now and they
 

13287
03:37:09,840 --> 03:37:11,429
fundamental theories right now and they
describe you know things like the

13288
03:37:11,429 --> 03:37:11,439
describe you know things like the
 

13289
03:37:11,439 --> 03:37:13,110
describe you know things like the
interaction of massive bodies or the way

13290
03:37:13,110 --> 03:37:13,120
interaction of massive bodies or the way
 

13291
03:37:13,120 --> 03:37:15,830
interaction of massive bodies or the way
that um charges accelerate or all these

13292
03:37:15,830 --> 03:37:15,840
that um charges accelerate or all these
 

13293
03:37:15,840 --> 03:37:17,190
that um charges accelerate or all these
kind of features

13294
03:37:17,190 --> 03:37:17,200
kind of features
 

13295
03:37:17,200 --> 03:37:19,030
kind of features
and and they're these really deep

13296
03:37:19,030 --> 03:37:19,040
and and they're these really deep
 

13297
03:37:19,040 --> 03:37:20,389
and and they're these really deep
theories and they tell us a lot about

13298
03:37:20,389 --> 03:37:20,399
theories and they tell us a lot about
 

13299
03:37:20,399 --> 03:37:21,750
theories and they tell us a lot about
how reality works but they're they're

13300
03:37:21,750 --> 03:37:21,760
how reality works but they're they're
 

13301
03:37:21,760 --> 03:37:23,990
how reality works but they're they're
completely agnostic to our existence and

13302
03:37:23,990 --> 03:37:24,000
completely agnostic to our existence and
 

13303
03:37:24,000 --> 03:37:25,590
completely agnostic to our existence and
i just i can't help but think that like

13304
03:37:25,590 --> 03:37:25,600
i just i can't help but think that like
 

13305
03:37:25,600 --> 03:37:27,190
i just i can't help but think that like
whatever describes us has to be even

13306
03:37:27,190 --> 03:37:27,200
whatever describes us has to be even
 

13307
03:37:27,200 --> 03:37:28,630
whatever describes us has to be even
deeper than that

13308
03:37:28,630 --> 03:37:28,640
deeper than that
 

13309
03:37:28,640 --> 03:37:30,710
deeper than that
um and i i think

13310
03:37:30,710 --> 03:37:30,720
um and i i think
 

13311
03:37:30,720 --> 03:37:33,670
um and i i think
incorporating memory i guess yeah

13312
03:37:33,670 --> 03:37:33,680
incorporating memory i guess yeah
 

13313
03:37:33,680 --> 03:37:35,349
incorporating memory i guess yeah
causality whatever the term you want to

13314
03:37:35,349 --> 03:37:35,359
causality whatever the term you want to
 

13315
03:37:35,359 --> 03:37:37,750
causality whatever the term you want to
use into the physics view of the world

13316
03:37:37,750 --> 03:37:37,760
use into the physics view of the world
 

13317
03:37:37,760 --> 03:37:40,070
use into the physics view of the world
might be that's the easiest way to do it

13318
03:37:40,070 --> 03:37:40,080
might be that's the easiest way to do it
 

13319
03:37:40,080 --> 03:37:42,229
might be that's the easiest way to do it
it's the it's the cleanest so here we go

13320
03:37:42,229 --> 03:37:42,239
it's the it's the cleanest so here we go
 

13321
03:37:42,239 --> 03:37:43,349
it's the it's the cleanest so here we go
again with the physicists i'm a

13322
03:37:43,349 --> 03:37:43,359
again with the physicists i'm a
 

13323
03:37:43,359 --> 03:37:45,110
again with the physicists i'm a
physicist the clean i was going to say

13324
03:37:45,110 --> 03:37:45,120
physicist the clean i was going to say
 

13325
03:37:45,120 --> 03:37:46,790
physicist the clean i was going to say
the simplest most elegant way of

13326
03:37:46,790 --> 03:37:46,800
the simplest most elegant way of
 

13327
03:37:46,800 --> 03:37:48,950
the simplest most elegant way of
resolving all of the kind of ways

13328
03:37:48,950 --> 03:37:48,960
resolving all of the kind of ways
 

13329
03:37:48,960 --> 03:37:51,990
resolving all of the kind of ways
that um we have we have these paradoxes

13330
03:37:51,990 --> 03:37:52,000
that um we have we have these paradoxes
 

13331
03:37:52,000 --> 03:37:53,990
that um we have we have these paradoxes
associated with life when you it's not

13332
03:37:53,990 --> 03:37:54,000
associated with life when you it's not
 

13333
03:37:54,000 --> 03:37:56,389
associated with life when you it's not
that life is not um

13334
03:37:56,389 --> 03:37:56,399
that life is not um
 

13335
03:37:56,399 --> 03:37:58,630
that life is not um
current physics is not incompatible with

13336
03:37:58,630 --> 03:37:58,640
current physics is not incompatible with
 

13337
03:37:58,640 --> 03:38:00,550
current physics is not incompatible with
life but it doesn't explain life and

13338
03:38:00,550 --> 03:38:00,560
life but it doesn't explain life and
 

13339
03:38:00,560 --> 03:38:02,630
life but it doesn't explain life and
then you you want to know where are the

13340
03:38:02,630 --> 03:38:02,640
then you you want to know where are the
 

13341
03:38:02,640 --> 03:38:04,950
then you you want to know where are the
explanatory gaps and this idea that we

13342
03:38:04,950 --> 03:38:04,960
explanatory gaps and this idea that we
 

13343
03:38:04,960 --> 03:38:07,110
explanatory gaps and this idea that we
have an assembly that time is

13344
03:38:07,110 --> 03:38:07,120
have an assembly that time is
 

13345
03:38:07,120 --> 03:38:08,870
have an assembly that time is
fundamental and and

13346
03:38:08,870 --> 03:38:08,880
fundamental and and
 

13347
03:38:08,880 --> 03:38:11,429
fundamental and and
objects actually are extended in time

13348
03:38:11,429 --> 03:38:11,439
objects actually are extended in time
 

13349
03:38:11,439 --> 03:38:13,030
objects actually are extended in time
and have physical extent in time is the

13350
03:38:13,030 --> 03:38:13,040
and have physical extent in time is the
 

13351
03:38:13,040 --> 03:38:14,710
and have physical extent in time is the
cleanest way of resolving a lot of the

13352
03:38:14,710 --> 03:38:14,720
cleanest way of resolving a lot of the
 

13353
03:38:14,720 --> 03:38:16,389
cleanest way of resolving a lot of the
explanatory gaps

13354
03:38:16,389 --> 03:38:16,399
explanatory gaps
 

13355
03:38:16,399 --> 03:38:17,750
explanatory gaps
so i

13356
03:38:17,750 --> 03:38:17,760
so i
 

13357
03:38:17,760 --> 03:38:19,110
so i
i've been struck i struggle with

13358
03:38:19,110 --> 03:38:19,120
i've been struck i struggle with
 

13359
03:38:19,120 --> 03:38:21,429
i've been struck i struggle with
assembly theory for many years because i

13360
03:38:21,429 --> 03:38:21,439
assembly theory for many years because i
 

13361
03:38:21,439 --> 03:38:24,070
assembly theory for many years because i
could see this gap

13362
03:38:24,070 --> 03:38:24,080
could see this gap
 

13363
03:38:24,080 --> 03:38:26,790
could see this gap
and i think when i first met sarah and

13364
03:38:26,790 --> 03:38:26,800
and i think when i first met sarah and
 

13365
03:38:26,800 --> 03:38:29,910
and i think when i first met sarah and
we realized we were kind of

13366
03:38:29,910 --> 03:38:29,920
we realized we were kind of
 

13367
03:38:29,920 --> 03:38:31,830
we realized we were kind of
talking about the same problem but we

13368
03:38:31,830 --> 03:38:31,840
talking about the same problem but we
 

13369
03:38:31,840 --> 03:38:33,349
talking about the same problem but we
were we

13370
03:38:33,349 --> 03:38:33,359
were we
 

13371
03:38:33,359 --> 03:38:34,710
were we
understood none of the language it was

13372
03:38:34,710 --> 03:38:34,720
understood none of the language it was
 

13373
03:38:34,720 --> 03:38:36,070
understood none of the language it was
quite hilarious actually because it's

13374
03:38:36,070 --> 03:38:36,080
quite hilarious actually because it's
 

13375
03:38:36,080 --> 03:38:37,189
quite hilarious actually because it's
like look i have no idea what we're

13376
03:38:37,189 --> 03:38:37,199
like look i have no idea what we're
 

13377
03:38:37,199 --> 03:38:39,189
like look i have no idea what we're
talking about but i think it sounds

13378
03:38:39,189 --> 03:38:39,199
talking about but i think it sounds
 

13379
03:38:39,199 --> 03:38:41,429
talking about but i think it sounds
right so for me the most beautiful thing

13380
03:38:41,429 --> 03:38:41,439
right so for me the most beautiful thing
 

13381
03:38:41,439 --> 03:38:43,990
right so for me the most beautiful thing
about assembly theory is i realized

13382
03:38:43,990 --> 03:38:44,000
about assembly theory is i realized
 

13383
03:38:44,000 --> 03:38:45,750
about assembly theory is i realized
the assembly theory explains why the

13384
03:38:45,750 --> 03:38:45,760
the assembly theory explains why the
 

13385
03:38:45,760 --> 03:38:47,349
the assembly theory explains why the
universe my life is a universe

13386

developing a memory but not only that

13388
03:38:49,590 --> 03:38:49,600

i could actually go and measure it

13392
03:38:53,269 --> 03:38:53,279
i could actually go and measure it
 

13393
03:38:53,279 --> 03:38:54,870
i could actually go and measure it
and i was like

13394
03:38:54,870 --> 03:38:54,880
and i was like
 

13395
03:38:54,880 --> 03:38:57,429
and i was like
holy we were just we physically

13396
03:38:57,429 --> 03:38:57,439
holy we were just we physically
 

13397

that have existed right
 

13477
03:40:18,800 --> 03:40:21,269
that have existed right
and will likely change the future of

hopefully understand what life is and go
 

13529
03:41:07,520 --> 03:41:09,030
hopefully understand what life is and go
into tech life elsewhere and make life

13530
03:41:09,030 --> 03:41:09,040
into tech life elsewhere and make life
 

13531
03:41:09,040 --> 03:41:10,070
into tech life elsewhere and make life
in the lab

13532
03:41:10,070 --> 03:41:10,080
in the lab
 

13533
03:41:10,080 --> 03:41:11,590
in the lab
how does that make you feel by the way

13534
03:41:11,590 --> 03:41:11,600
how does that make you feel by the way
 

13535
03:41:11,600 --> 03:41:13,670
how does that make you feel by the way
does it make you feel less special that

13536
03:41:13,670 --> 03:41:13,680
does it make you feel less special that
 

13537
03:41:13,680 --> 03:41:15,990
does it make you feel less special that
you're so deeply integrated

13538
03:41:15,990 --> 03:41:16,000
you're so deeply integrated
 

13539
03:41:16,000 --> 03:41:18,469
you're so deeply integrated
interconnected to the lineage i mean i

13540
03:41:18,469 --> 03:41:18,479
interconnected to the lineage i mean i
 

13541
03:41:18,479 --> 03:41:20,070
interconnected to the lineage i mean i
came on one level i just wanted in my

13542
03:41:20,070 --> 03:41:20,080
came on one level i just wanted in my
 

13543
03:41:20,080 --> 03:41:21,990
came on one level i just wanted in my
life as a scientist i wanted to have an

13544
03:41:21,990 --> 03:41:22,000
life as a scientist i wanted to have an
 

13545
03:41:22,000 --> 03:41:23,830
life as a scientist i wanted to have an
interesting idea just once or an

13546
03:41:23,830 --> 03:41:23,840
interesting idea just once or an
 

13547
03:41:23,840 --> 03:41:25,429
interesting idea just once or an
original idea

13548
03:41:25,429 --> 03:41:25,439
original idea
 

13549
03:41:25,439 --> 03:41:28,630
original idea
i mean it was like you know uh so i

13550
03:41:28,630 --> 03:41:28,640
i mean it was like you know uh so i
 

13551
03:41:28,640 --> 03:41:30,389
i mean it was like you know uh so i
think that was cool that we had this

13552
03:41:30,389 --> 03:41:30,399
think that was cool that we had this
 

13553
03:41:30,399 --> 03:41:31,590
think that was cool that we had this
idea and we were playing with it and i

13554
03:41:31,590 --> 03:41:31,600
idea and we were playing with it and i
 

13555
03:41:31,600 --> 03:41:34,710
idea and we were playing with it and i
think also that um i i kind of i mean it

13556
03:41:34,710 --> 03:41:34,720
think also that um i i kind of i mean it
 

13557
03:41:34,720 --> 03:41:37,030
think also that um i i kind of i mean it
took me ages to realize that sarah had

13558
03:41:37,030 --> 03:41:37,040
took me ages to realize that sarah had
 

13559
03:41:37,040 --> 03:41:38,870
took me ages to realize that sarah had
also had the same kind of form coming

13560
03:41:38,870 --> 03:41:38,880
also had the same kind of form coming
 

13561
03:41:38,880 --> 03:41:40,550
also had the same kind of form coming
towards the same formulation just from a

13562
03:41:40,550 --> 03:41:40,560
towards the same formulation just from a
 

13563
03:41:40,560 --> 03:41:42,389
towards the same formulation just from a
completely different point

13564
03:41:42,389 --> 03:41:42,399
completely different point
 

13565
03:41:42,399 --> 03:41:44,870
completely different point
because i um but no it makes me feel

13566
03:41:44,870 --> 03:41:44,880
because i um but no it makes me feel
 

13567
03:41:44,880 --> 03:41:46,389
because i um but no it makes me feel
special it also makes me feel connected

13568
03:41:46,389 --> 03:41:46,399
special it also makes me feel connected
 

13569
03:41:46,399 --> 03:41:49,110
special it also makes me feel connected
to the universe it also makes me feel

13570
03:41:49,110 --> 03:41:49,120
to the universe it also makes me feel
 

13571
03:41:49,120 --> 03:41:51,510
to the universe it also makes me feel
not just humble about you know being a

13572
03:41:51,510 --> 03:41:51,520
not just humble about you know being a
 

13573
03:41:51,520 --> 03:41:53,670
not just humble about you know being a
living object in the universe but the

13574
03:41:53,670 --> 03:41:53,680
living object in the universe but the
 

13575
03:41:53,680 --> 03:41:55,510
living object in the universe but the
fact that it makes me really optimistic

13576
03:41:55,510 --> 03:41:55,520
fact that it makes me really optimistic
 

13577
03:41:55,520 --> 03:41:56,790
fact that it makes me really optimistic
about what the universe is going to do

13578
03:41:56,790 --> 03:41:56,800
about what the universe is going to do
 

13579
03:41:56,800 --> 03:41:57,990
about what the universe is going to do
in the future

13580
03:41:57,990 --> 03:41:58,000
in the future
 

13581
03:41:58,000 --> 03:41:59,510
in the future
because we're not just

13582
03:41:59,510 --> 03:41:59,520
because we're not just
 

13583
03:41:59,520 --> 03:42:02,870
because we're not just
isolated phenomena we are connected i

13584
03:42:02,870 --> 03:42:02,880
isolated phenomena we are connected i
 

13585
03:42:02,880 --> 03:42:05,189
isolated phenomena we are connected i
will be able to have you know one of my

13586
03:42:05,189 --> 03:42:05,199
will be able to have you know one of my
 

13587
03:42:05,199 --> 03:42:07,189
will be able to have you know one of my
small objectives in life is to change

13588
03:42:07,189 --> 03:42:07,199
small objectives in life is to change
 

13589
03:42:07,199 --> 03:42:09,590
small objectives in life is to change
the future of the universe in some

13590
03:42:09,590 --> 03:42:09,600
the future of the universe in some
 

13591
03:42:09,600 --> 03:42:12,550
the future of the universe in some
profound way just by existing yeah

13592
03:42:12,550 --> 03:42:12,560
profound way just by existing yeah
 

13593
03:42:12,560 --> 03:42:19,030
profound way just by existing yeah
that's not ambitious at all

13594
03:42:19,030 --> 03:42:19,040

 

13595
03:42:19,040 --> 03:42:20,469

i think it's also good because it makes

13596
03:42:20,469 --> 03:42:20,479
i think it's also good because it makes
 

13597
03:42:20,479 --> 03:42:22,229
i think it's also good because it makes
me feel less lonely because i just

13598
03:42:22,229 --> 03:42:22,239
me feel less lonely because i just
 

13599
03:42:22,239 --> 03:42:23,670
me feel less lonely because i just
realized i'm not like i mean i'm a

13600
03:42:23,670 --> 03:42:23,680
realized i'm not like i mean i'm a
 

13601
03:42:23,680 --> 03:42:25,189
realized i'm not like i mean i'm a
unique assembly structure but i have so

13602
03:42:25,189 --> 03:42:25,199
unique assembly structure but i have so
 

13603
03:42:25,199 --> 03:42:27,110
unique assembly structure but i have so
much overlap with the other entities i

13604
03:42:27,110 --> 03:42:27,120
much overlap with the other entities i
 

13605
03:42:27,120 --> 03:42:30,150
much overlap with the other entities i
interact with that we're not completely

13606
03:42:30,150 --> 03:42:30,160
interact with that we're not completely
 

13607
03:42:30,160 --> 03:42:32,790
interact with that we're not completely
individual right and yet

13608
03:42:32,790 --> 03:42:32,800
individual right and yet
 

13609
03:42:32,800 --> 03:42:36,070
individual right and yet
your existence does have a

13610
03:42:36,070 --> 03:42:36,080
your existence does have a
 

13611
03:42:36,080 --> 03:42:38,389
your existence does have a
huge amount of impact on the how this

13612
03:42:38,389 --> 03:42:38,399
huge amount of impact on the how this
 

13613
03:42:38,399 --> 03:42:40,950
huge amount of impact on the how this
whole thing unrolls on the future

13614
03:42:40,950 --> 03:42:40,960
whole thing unrolls on the future
 

13615
03:42:40,960 --> 03:42:43,269
whole thing unrolls on the future
of the as individuals that's yeah all

13616
03:42:43,269 --> 03:42:43,279
of the as individuals that's yeah all
 

13617
03:42:43,279 --> 03:42:44,870
of the as individuals that's yeah all
right but i was going to say packets of

13618
03:42:44,870 --> 03:42:44,880
right but i was going to say packets of
 

13619
03:42:44,880 --> 03:42:47,269
right but i was going to say packets of
agency i think we all have a profound

13620
03:42:47,269 --> 03:42:47,279
agency i think we all have a profound
 

13621
03:42:47,279 --> 03:42:48,790
agency i think we all have a profound
impact on the future some more than

13622
03:42:48,790 --> 03:42:48,800
impact on the future some more than
 

13623
03:42:48,800 --> 03:42:50,710
impact on the future some more than
others right all human beings all life

13624
03:42:50,710 --> 03:42:50,720
others right all human beings all life
 

13625
03:42:50,720 --> 03:42:52,630
others right all human beings all life
and i mean that's why

13626
03:42:52,630 --> 03:42:52,640
and i mean that's why
 

13627
03:42:52,640 --> 03:42:54,469
and i mean that's why
i think it's a privilege in a way for

13628
03:42:54,469 --> 03:42:54,479
i think it's a privilege in a way for
 

13629
03:42:54,479 --> 03:42:56,309
i think it's a privilege in a way for
you know to say like to assert some

you know to say like to assert some
degree of ego and agency

13632
03:42:58,870 --> 03:42:58,880
degree of ego and agency
 

13633
03:42:58,880 --> 03:43:00,389
degree of ego and agency
you know i'm going to make a computer or

13634
03:43:00,389 --> 03:43:00,399
you know i'm going to make a computer or
 

13635
03:43:00,399 --> 03:43:01,910
you know i'm going to make a computer or
make an origin life machine or you know

13636
03:43:01,910 --> 03:43:01,920
make an origin life machine or you know
 

13637
03:43:01,920 --> 03:43:03,750
make an origin life machine or you know
this thing but actually it's just like

13638
03:43:03,750 --> 03:43:03,760
this thing but actually it's just like
 

13639
03:43:03,760 --> 03:43:05,750
this thing but actually it's just like
you know life's probably living

13640
03:43:05,750 --> 03:43:05,760
you know life's probably living
 

13641
03:43:05,760 --> 03:43:07,990
you know life's probably living
if there is a god or there's a soul in

if there is a god or there's a soul in
everything it's really laughing at us

13644
03:43:09,510 --> 03:43:09,520
everything it's really laughing at us
 

13645

going
 

13647
03:43:10,239 --> 03:43:12,469
going
i fool these guys by giving them ego so

13648
03:43:12,469 --> 03:43:12,479
i fool these guys by giving them ego so
 

13649
03:43:12,479 --> 03:43:14,070
i fool these guys by giving them ego so
they strive for this stuff and look what

13650
03:43:14,070 --> 03:43:14,080
they strive for this stuff and look what
 

13651
03:43:14,080 --> 03:43:16,630
they strive for this stuff and look what
it does for you know the assembly space

13652
03:43:16,630 --> 03:43:16,640
it does for you know the assembly space
 

13653
03:43:16,640 --> 03:43:18,389
it does for you know the assembly space
of the universe and there's always a

13654
03:43:18,389 --> 03:43:18,399
of the universe and there's always a
 

13655
03:43:18,399 --> 03:43:19,750
of the universe and there's always a
possibility that science can't answer

13656
03:43:19,750 --> 03:43:19,760
possibility that science can't answer
 

13657
03:43:19,760 --> 03:43:21,110
possibility that science can't answer
all of it so

13658

all of it so
 

13659
03:43:21,120 --> 03:43:23,189
all of it so

first chemist to make drugs off world of
 

13997
03:49:00,560 --> 03:49:02,469
first chemist to make drugs off world of
the first drug manufacturer in space

the first drug manufacturer in space
yeah why not drop do they have to be

14000
03:49:04,710 --> 03:49:04,720
yeah why not drop do they have to be
 

14001
03:49:04,720 --> 03:49:07,349
yeah why not drop do they have to be
somehow like be able to habitate like to

14002

somehow like be able to habitate like to
be able to survive on that particular

14004
03:49:09,590 --> 03:49:09,600
be able to survive on that particular
 

14005
03:49:09,600 --> 03:49:10,389
be able to survive on that particular
space

14006
03:49:10,389 --> 03:49:10,399
space
 

14007
03:49:10,399 --> 03:49:11,189
space
or

14008
03:49:11,189 --> 03:49:11,199
or
 

14009
03:49:11,199 --> 03:49:12,790
or
like what's the connection between being

like what's the connection between being
 

14011
03:49:12,800 --> 03:49:14,710
like what's the connection between being
on mars and do makeup i just would like

14012

control over chemicals
 

14019
03:49:20,960 --> 03:49:22,950

programmatically off earth to somewhere

14020
03:49:22,950 --> 03:49:22,960
programmatically off earth to somewhere
 

14021
03:49:22,960 --> 03:49:23,990

problems

14028
03:49:28,550 --> 03:49:28,560
problems
 

14029
03:49:28,560 --> 03:49:30,070
problems
before i die if i can do that would you

14030
03:49:30,070 --> 03:49:30,080
before i die if i can do that would you
 

14031
03:49:30,080 --> 03:49:32,389
before i die if i can do that would you
travel to space before yeah yeah that's

14032
03:49:32,389 --> 03:49:32,399
travel to space before yeah yeah that's
 

14033
03:49:32,399 --> 03:49:33,590
travel to space before yeah yeah that's
what i'm saying i'd love to go into

14034
03:49:33,590 --> 03:49:33,600
what i'm saying i'd love to go into
 

14035
03:49:33,600 --> 03:49:35,750
what i'm saying i'd love to go into
space but not just to be a tourist i

14036
03:49:35,750 --> 03:49:35,760
space but not just to be a tourist i
 

14037
03:49:35,760 --> 03:49:37,990
space but not just to be a tourist i
want to take scientific experiment in

14038
03:49:37,990 --> 03:49:38,000
want to take scientific experiment in
 

14039
03:49:38,000 --> 03:49:39,750
want to take scientific experiment in
space and do a thing in space that never

14040
03:49:39,750 --> 03:49:39,760
space and do a thing in space that never
 

14041
03:49:39,760 --> 03:49:41,189
space and do a thing in space that never
been done before

14042
03:49:41,189 --> 03:49:41,199
been done before
 

14043
03:49:41,199 --> 03:49:44,150
been done before
that's a real possibility yeah yeah yeah

14044
03:49:44,150 --> 03:49:44,160
that's a real possibility yeah yeah yeah
 

14045
03:49:44,160 --> 03:49:45,990
that's a real possibility yeah yeah yeah
so that's why there's no point in

14046
03:49:45,990 --> 03:49:46,000
so that's why there's no point in
 

14047
03:49:46,000 --> 03:49:47,830
so that's why there's no point in
listing things i can't do

14048
03:49:47,830 --> 03:49:47,840
listing things i can't do

03:54:41,520 --> 03:54:42,550
um so i always tell people that they
should do the thing they're most

14352

should do the thing they're most
 

14353
03:54:42,560 --> 03:54:44,229
should do the thing they're most
passionate about but i think a flip side

14354
03:54:44,229 --> 03:54:44,239
passionate about but i think a flip side
 

14355
03:54:44,239 --> 03:54:45,590
passionate about but i think a flip side
of that is

14356
03:54:45,590 --> 03:54:45,600
of that is
 

14357
03:54:45,600 --> 03:54:47,990
of that is
that's when you become uh in some mind

14358
03:54:47,990 --> 03:54:48,000
that's when you become uh in some mind
 

14359
03:54:48,000 --> 03:54:49,590
that's when you become uh in some mind
like not to sound cheesy but like your

14360
03:54:49,590 --> 03:54:49,600
like not to sound cheesy but like your
 

14361
03:54:49,600 --> 03:54:51,990
like not to sound cheesy but like your
best version of yourself so i guess like

14362
03:54:51,990 --> 03:54:52,000
best version of yourself so i guess like
 

14363
03:54:52,000 --> 03:54:54,229
best version of yourself so i guess like
for me as i become more successful in my

14364
03:54:54,229 --> 03:54:54,239
for me as i become more successful in my
 

14365
03:54:54,239 --> 03:54:56,070
for me as i become more successful in my
career i feel like i can be more myself

03:54:56,080 --> 03:54:58,150
career i feel like i can be more myself
as an individual and so there's this

14368
03:54:58,150 --> 03:54:58,160
as an individual and so there's this
 

14369
03:54:58,160 --> 03:54:59,670
as an individual and so there's this
i've always been following the questions

14370
03:54:59,670 --> 03:54:59,680
i've always been following the questions
 

14371
03:54:59,680 --> 03:55:01,990
i've always been following the questions
i'm most interested in which very early

14372
03:55:01,990 --> 03:55:02,000
i'm most interested in which very early
 

14373
03:55:02,000 --> 03:55:04,070
i'm most interested in which very early
on i was discouraged from knowing by

14374
03:55:04,070 --> 03:55:04,080
on i was discouraged from knowing by
 

14375
03:55:04,080 --> 03:55:05,349
on i was discouraged from knowing by
many people because they thought they

14376
03:55:05,349 --> 03:55:05,359
many people because they thought they
 

14377
03:55:05,359 --> 03:55:07,110
many people because they thought they
were unanswerable questions and i always

14378
03:55:07,110 --> 03:55:07,120
were unanswerable questions and i always
 

14379
03:55:07,120 --> 03:55:09,590
were unanswerable questions and i always
just thought well if no one's even

14380
03:55:09,590 --> 03:55:09,600
just thought well if no one's even
 

14381
03:55:09,600 --> 03:55:10,870
just thought well if no one's even
trying to answer them of course they're

14382
03:55:10,870 --> 03:55:10,880
trying to answer them of course they're
 

14383
03:55:10,880 --> 03:55:12,550
trying to answer them of course they're
going to be unanswerable and then that

14384
03:55:12,550 --> 03:55:12,560
going to be unanswerable and then that
 

14385
03:55:12,560 --> 03:55:13,990
going to be unanswerable and then that
was kind of an odd viewpoint but the

14386
03:55:13,990 --> 03:55:14,000
was kind of an odd viewpoint but the
 

14387
03:55:14,000 --> 03:55:16,790
was kind of an odd viewpoint but the
more i i found my way in that space the

14388
03:55:16,790 --> 03:55:16,800
more i i found my way in that space the
 

14389
03:55:16,800 --> 03:55:19,110
more i i found my way in that space the
more i also made a space for myself as a

14390
03:55:19,110 --> 03:55:19,120
more i also made a space for myself as a
 

14391
03:55:19,120 --> 03:55:21,670
more i also made a space for myself as a
person because you're basically

14392
03:55:21,670 --> 03:55:21,680
person because you're basically
 

14393
03:55:21,680 --> 03:55:23,510
person because you're basically
generating the niche that you want to

14394
03:55:23,510 --> 03:55:23,520
generating the niche that you want to
 

14395
03:55:23,520 --> 03:55:27,189
generating the niche that you want to
exist in um and so i think um

14396
03:55:27,189 --> 03:55:27,199
exist in um and so i think um
 

14397
03:55:27,199 --> 03:55:28,469
exist in um and so i think um
i think that's

14398
03:55:28,469 --> 03:55:28,479
i think that's
 

14399
03:55:28,479 --> 03:55:30,070
i think that's
that's part of it is not just to follow

14400
03:55:30,070 --> 03:55:30,080
that's part of it is not just to follow
 

14401
03:55:30,080 --> 03:55:31,750
that's part of it is not just to follow
your passion but also think about like

14402
03:55:31,750 --> 03:55:31,760
your passion but also think about like
 

14403
03:55:31,760 --> 03:55:33,349
your passion but also think about like

like

14418
03:55:48,150 --> 03:55:48,160
like
 

14419
03:55:48,160 --> 03:55:51,189
like
if i become something

14420
03:55:51,189 --> 03:55:51,199

okay um
i have one um because you know like

14494
03:57:02,150 --> 03:57:02,160
i have one um because you know like
 

14495
03:57:02,160 --> 03:57:03,910
i have one um because you know like
obviously i self-identify as a scientist

14496
03:57:03,910 --> 03:57:03,920
obviously i self-identify as a scientist
 

14497
03:57:03,920 --> 03:57:05,429
obviously i self-identify as a scientist
and a physicist but intrinsically i feel

14498
03:57:05,429 --> 03:57:05,439
and a physicist but intrinsically i feel
 

14499
03:57:05,439 --> 03:57:07,189
and a physicist but intrinsically i feel
more like an artist but it's almost like

14500
03:57:07,189 --> 03:57:07,199
more like an artist but it's almost like
 

14501
03:57:07,199 --> 03:57:08,309
more like an artist but it's almost like
you're an artist that you don't know

14502
03:57:08,309 --> 03:57:08,319
you're an artist that you don't know
 

14503
03:57:08,319 --> 03:57:10,469
you're an artist that you don't know
what you're painting yet um and i guess

14504
03:57:10,469 --> 03:57:10,479
what you're painting yet um and i guess
 

14505
03:57:10,479 --> 03:57:13,189
what you're painting yet um and i guess
i feel like that's humanity like in in

14506
03:57:13,189 --> 03:57:13,199
i feel like that's humanity like in in
 

14507
03:57:13,199 --> 03:57:15,670
i feel like that's humanity like in in
some sense we're we're creating

14508
03:57:15,670 --> 03:57:15,680
some sense we're we're creating
 

14509
03:57:15,680 --> 03:57:18,389
some sense we're we're creating
something i think is profound and

14510
03:57:18,389 --> 03:57:18,399
something i think is profound and
 

14511
03:57:18,399 --> 03:57:19,750
something i think is profound and
potentially very beautiful like

14512
03:57:19,750 --> 03:57:19,760
potentially very beautiful like
 

14513
03:57:19,760 --> 03:57:21,349
potentially very beautiful like
existence of the universe but we're just

14514
03:57:21,349 --> 03:57:21,359
existence of the universe but we're just
 

14515
03:57:21,359 --> 03:57:22,309
existence of the universe but we're just
so

14516
03:57:22,309 --> 03:57:22,319
so
 

14517
03:57:22,319 --> 03:57:24,710
so
night like not night oh we're just early

14518
03:57:24,710 --> 03:57:24,720
night like not night oh we're just early
 

14519
03:57:24,720 --> 03:57:27,030
night like not night oh we're just early
we're we're early we're young we don't

14520
03:57:27,030 --> 03:57:27,040
we're we're early we're young we don't
 

14521
03:57:27,040 --> 03:57:28,710
we're we're early we're young we don't
know what we're doing yet yeah what's

14522
03:57:28,710 --> 03:57:28,720
know what we're doing yet yeah what's
 

14523
03:57:28,720 --> 03:57:31,110
know what we're doing yet yeah what's
with the nuclear weapons is the question

14524
03:57:31,110 --> 03:57:31,120
with the nuclear weapons is the question
 

14525
03:57:31,120 --> 03:57:32,790
with the nuclear weapons is the question
too like what are you guys what are we

14526
03:57:32,790 --> 03:57:32,800
too like what are you guys what are we
 

14527
03:57:32,800 --> 03:57:35,269
too like what are you guys what are we
doing with them this creativity that you

14528
03:57:35,269 --> 03:57:35,279
doing with them this creativity that you
 

14529
03:57:35,279 --> 03:57:37,030
doing with them this creativity that you
talked it sounds very nice but it's

14530
03:57:37,030 --> 03:57:37,040
talked it sounds very nice but it's
 

14531
03:57:37,040 --> 03:57:38,710
talked it sounds very nice but it's
you're seeing we're making things that

14532
03:57:38,710 --> 03:57:38,720
you're seeing we're making things that
 

14533
03:57:38,720 --> 03:57:40,950
you're seeing we're making things that
are like very destructive and like the

14534
03:57:40,950 --> 03:57:40,960
are like very destructive and like the
 

14535
03:57:40,960 --> 03:57:43,590
are like very destructive and like the
rockets what this seems very aggressive

14536
03:57:43,590 --> 03:57:43,600
rockets what this seems very aggressive
 

14537
03:57:43,600 --> 03:57:48,229
rockets what this seems very aggressive
yeah i know this is my my blinders on um

14538
03:57:48,229 --> 03:57:48,239
yeah i know this is my my blinders on um
 

14539
03:57:48,239 --> 03:57:49,830
yeah i know this is my my blinders on um
i don't know i i mean it goes back to

14540
03:57:49,830 --> 03:57:49,840
i don't know i i mean it goes back to
 

14541
03:57:49,840 --> 03:57:50,950
i don't know i i mean it goes back to
the whole conversation about suffering i

14542
03:57:50,950 --> 03:57:50,960
the whole conversation about suffering i
 

14543
03:57:50,960 --> 03:57:53,510
the whole conversation about suffering i
have a hard time uh regularizing certain

14544
03:57:53,510 --> 03:57:53,520
have a hard time uh regularizing certain
 

14545
03:57:53,520 --> 03:57:55,830
have a hard time uh regularizing certain
aspects of reality into what i want to

14546
03:57:55,830 --> 03:57:55,840
aspects of reality into what i want to
 

14547
03:57:55,840 --> 03:57:57,510
aspects of reality into what i want to
envision and that's obviously

14548
03:57:57,510 --> 03:57:57,520
envision and that's obviously
 

14549
03:57:57,520 --> 03:58:00,229
envision and that's obviously
problematic but you know nuclear power

14550
03:58:00,229 --> 03:58:00,239
problematic but you know nuclear power
 

14551
03:58:00,239 --> 03:58:02,469
problematic but you know nuclear power
has also given us a lot of good things

14552
03:58:02,469 --> 03:58:02,479
has also given us a lot of good things
 

14553
03:58:02,479 --> 03:58:06,389
has also given us a lot of good things
so um so both that's human nature both

14554
03:58:06,389 --> 03:58:06,399
so um so both that's human nature both
 

14555
03:58:06,399 --> 03:58:08,389
so um so both that's human nature both
both human beings and the technology we

14556
03:58:08,389 --> 03:58:08,399
both human beings and the technology we
 

14557
03:58:08,399 --> 03:58:10,309
both human beings and the technology we
create has the capacity for evil and the

14558
03:58:10,309 --> 03:58:10,319
create has the capacity for evil and the
 

14559
03:58:10,319 --> 03:58:12,070
create has the capacity for evil and the
capacity yeah we can't all be good all

14560
03:58:12,070 --> 03:58:12,080
capacity yeah we can't all be good all
 

14561
03:58:12,080 --> 03:58:13,429
capacity yeah we can't all be good all
the time i mean there's like this huge

14562
03:58:13,429 --> 03:58:13,439
the time i mean there's like this huge
 

14563
03:58:13,439 --> 03:58:15,750
the time i mean there's like this huge
misnomer that you need to be liked by

14564
03:58:15,750 --> 03:58:15,760
misnomer that you need to be liked by
 

14565
03:58:15,760 --> 03:58:17,910
misnomer that you need to be liked by
everyone universally and obviously

14566
03:58:17,910 --> 03:58:17,920
everyone universally and obviously
 

14567
03:58:17,920 --> 03:58:19,910
everyone universally and obviously
that's like an ideal but it's physically

14568
03:58:19,910 --> 03:58:19,920
that's like an ideal but it's physically
 

14569
03:58:19,920 --> 03:58:21,990
that's like an ideal but it's physically
impossible you like you can't get a

14570
03:58:21,990 --> 03:58:22,000
impossible you like you can't get a
 

14571
03:58:22,000 --> 03:58:23,269
impossible you like you can't get a
group of people in the room and have

14572
03:58:23,269 --> 03:58:23,279
group of people in the room and have
 

14573
03:58:23,279 --> 03:58:25,590
group of people in the room and have
everyone like each other all the time so

14574
03:58:25,590 --> 03:58:25,600
everyone like each other all the time so
 

14575
03:58:25,600 --> 03:58:27,670
everyone like each other all the time so
i think that kind of tension is actually

14576
03:58:27,670 --> 03:58:27,680
i think that kind of tension is actually
 

14577
03:58:27,680 --> 03:58:30,070
i think that kind of tension is actually
really important um that we have

14578
03:58:30,070 --> 03:58:30,080
really important um that we have
 

14579
03:58:30,080 --> 03:58:32,150
really important um that we have
different aesthetics

14580
03:58:32,150 --> 03:58:32,160
different aesthetics
 

14581
03:58:32,160 --> 03:58:33,910
different aesthetics
different goals

14582
03:58:33,910 --> 03:58:33,920
different goals
 

14583
03:58:33,920 --> 03:58:34,790
different goals
uh

14584
03:58:34,790 --> 03:58:34,800
uh
 

14585
03:58:34,800 --> 03:58:35,510
uh
and

14586
03:58:35,510 --> 03:58:35,520
and
 

14587
03:58:35,520 --> 03:58:37,110
and
and sometimes

14588
03:58:37,110 --> 03:58:37,120
and sometimes
 

14589
03:58:37,120 --> 03:58:39,189
and sometimes
conflict comes out of that yeah speaking

14590
03:58:39,189 --> 03:58:39,199
conflict comes out of that yeah speaking
 

14591
03:58:39,199 --> 03:58:42,070
conflict comes out of that yeah speaking
of which do you lee and yoshibach ever

14592
03:58:42,070 --> 03:58:42,080
of which do you lee and yoshibach ever
 

14593
03:58:42,080 --> 03:58:43,990
of which do you lee and yoshibach ever
say anything nice to each other or is it

14594
03:58:43,990 --> 03:58:44,000
say anything nice to each other or is it
 

14595
03:58:44,000 --> 03:58:45,269
say anything nice to each other or is it
always conflict

14596
03:58:45,269 --> 03:58:45,279
always conflict
 

14597
03:58:45,279 --> 03:58:47,429
always conflict
we never have conflict we argue but i

14598
03:58:47,429 --> 03:58:47,439
we never have conflict we argue but i
 

14599
03:58:47,439 --> 03:58:49,269
we never have conflict we argue but i
don't i don't think they argue arguments

14601
03:58:49,279 --> 03:58:50,229
don't i don't think they argue arguments
are bad

14602
03:58:50,229 --> 03:58:50,239
are bad
 

14603
03:58:50,239 --> 03:58:52,150
are bad
i mean i think the problem i have yeah

14604
03:58:52,150 --> 03:58:52,160
i mean i think the problem i have yeah
 

14605
03:58:52,160 --> 03:58:54,630
