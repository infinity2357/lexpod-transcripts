um
 

195
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,190
um
which i sort of leave open as a question

196
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,200
which i sort of leave open as a question
 

197
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,270

211
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,190
you were in the west uh or not i think i
was somewhere near it

212
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200
was somewhere near it
 

213
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,030
was somewhere near it
think getting closer

214
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,040
think getting closer
 

215
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,309
think getting closer
i mean you know it's it's this is what

216
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,319
i mean you know it's it's this is what
 

217
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,430
i mean you know it's it's this is what
tulsa asks the question doesn't it

218
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
tulsa asks the question doesn't it
 

219
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,949
tulsa asks the question doesn't it
whether it's european

220
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:50,959
whether it's european
 

221
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,110
whether it's european
and i think the answer to that is

222
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
and i think the answer to that is
 

223
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,190
and i think the answer to that is
not really although massively influenced

not really although massively influenced
 

225
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,630
not really although massively influenced
by europe but

226
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:56,640
by europe but
 

227
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,949
by europe but
um and times wanting to reach towards it

debate
because they didn't know the answer and

786
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:18,480
because they didn't know the answer and
 

787
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,030
because they didn't know the answer and
it i mean people say that darwin

788
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,040
it i mean people say that darwin

um
solved this it wasn't just darwin of

792
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:24,399
solved this it wasn't just darwin of
 

793
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,990
solved this it wasn't just darwin of
course but

794
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,000
course but
 

795
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,949
course but
by the late 19th century the argument

796
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:28,959
by the late 19th century the argument
 

797
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,389
by the late 19th century the argument
that we were not

798
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:30,399
that we were not
 

799
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,150
that we were not
all related

800
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:32,160
all related
 

801
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,310
all related
as human beings had suffered so many

802
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
as human beings had suffered so many
 

803
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,910
as human beings had suffered so many
blows that

804
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:35,920
blows that
 

805
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,790
blows that
you had to really be very very ignorant

806
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:38,800
you had to really be very very ignorant
 

807
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,470
you had to really be very very ignorant
deliberately willfully ignorant to

808
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:40,480
deliberately willfully ignorant to
 

809
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,710
deliberately willfully ignorant to
ignore it by that so it no longer was

810
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:42,720
ignore it by that so it no longer was
 

811
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,189
ignore it by that so it no longer was
after darwin a theological question it

812
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:45,199
after darwin a theological question it
 

813
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,430
after darwin a theological question it
became a moral question it was already a

814
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:47,440
became a moral question it was already a
 

815
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,430
became a moral question it was already a
moral question but it clarified darwin

816
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:49,440
moral question but it clarified darwin
 

817
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,069
moral question but it clarified darwin
clarifies it definitely and then you're

818
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:52,079
clarifies it definitely and then you're
 

819
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,150
clarifies it definitely and then you're
in the same in a situation of you're not

820
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,160
in the same in a situation of you're not
 

821
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,910
in the same in a situation of you're not
subjugating some other people you're

822
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:55,920
subjugating some other people you're
 

823
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,509
subjugating some other people you're
subjugating your own

824
00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:57,519
subjugating your own
 

825
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,629
subjugating your own
kin

826
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:58,639
kin
 

827
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,750
kin
and and

828
00:13:59,750 --> 00:13:59,760
and and
 

829
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,350
and and
that becomes morally unsustainable

830
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:03,360
that becomes morally unsustainable
 

831
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,590
that becomes morally unsustainable
so

832
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:05,600

 

833
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,829

00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:55,519
and that's and that the consequences of
 

1003
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,470
and that's and that the consequences of
slavery could be one of the factors that

1004
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:58,480
slavery could be one of the factors that
 

1005
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,269
slavery could be one of the factors that
resulted from this

1006
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:01,279
resulted from this
 

1007
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,110
resulted from this
the thing is i don't think it's it's a

1008
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,120
the thing is i don't think it's it's a
 

1009
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,470
the thing is i don't think it's it's a
um

1010
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:04,480
um
 

1011
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,829
um
i don't think it's a single issue answer

1012
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:07,839
i don't think it's a single issue answer
 

1013
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,309
i don't think it's a single issue answer
i think it's a multi-dimensional issue

1014
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:10,319
i think it's a multi-dimensional issue
 

1015
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,750
i think it's a multi-dimensional issue
something like black underachievement in

1016
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:11,760
something like black underachievement in
 

1017
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,990
something like black underachievement in
america is obviously a multi-dimensional

1018
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,000
america is obviously a multi-dimensional
 

1019
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,990
america is obviously a multi-dimensional
issue

1020
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,000
issue
 

1021
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,590
issue
much of the left and others wish to say

1022
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:19,600
much of the left and others wish to say
 

1023
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,230
much of the left and others wish to say
it's not it's only about racism

1024
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:22,240
it's not it's only about racism
 

1025
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,029
it's not it's only about racism
and they can't answer why

1026
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:25,039
and they can't answer why
 

1027
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,110
and they can't answer why
asians who've arrived more recently

1028
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,120
asians who've arrived more recently
 

1029
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,029
asians who've arrived more recently
don't for instance get held down by

1030
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:29,039
don't for instance get held down by
 

1031
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,669
don't for instance get held down by
white supremacy but actually i say white

supremacy in
 

1035
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,590
supremacy in
quotes obviously yeah but don't get held

1036
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:35,600
quotes obviously yeah but don't get held
 

1037
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,590
quotes obviously yeah but don't get held
back by it but actually flourish to the

1038
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:37,600
back by it but actually flourish to the
 

1039
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,310
back by it but actually flourish to the
extent that asian americans uh have a

1040
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:40,320
extent that asian americans uh have a
 

1041
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,990
extent that asian americans uh have a
higher household earnings and higher

1042
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,000
higher household earnings and higher
 

1043
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,630
higher household earnings and higher
house household mean um

1044
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:44,640
house household mean um
 

1045
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,510
house household mean um
uh

1046
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:45,520
uh
 

1047
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,590
uh
uh equity than

1048
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:47,600
uh equity than
 

1049
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,669
uh equity than
home equity and so on than than white

1050
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:49,679
home equity and so on than than white
 

1051
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,430

americans
 

1053
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,310
americans
uh so i don't think that on the merits

1054
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:54,320
uh so i don't think that on the merits
 

1055
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,470
uh so i don't think that on the merits
the evidence is there that you know

1056
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:56,480
the evidence is there that you know
 

1057
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,390
the evidence is there that you know
racism is the explanation for black

1058
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:58,400
racism is the explanation for black
 

1059
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,310
racism is the explanation for black
ongoing black underachievement in some

00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:00,320
ongoing black underachievement in some
 

1061
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,430

america
 

1065
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,110
america
it's obviously a part of it could you

1066
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,120
it's obviously a part of it could you
 

1067
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,669
it's obviously a part of it could you
say that even those things like

1068
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:07,679
say that even those things like
 

1069
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,430
say that even those things like
fatherlessness and

1070
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:11,440

 

1071
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,390

similar family breakdown issues

1072
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:14,400
similar family breakdown issues
 

1073
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,390
similar family breakdown issues
are a long-term consequence of it

1074
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:18,400
are a long-term consequence of it
 

1075
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,710
are a long-term consequence of it
possibly but it's it's being awfully

1076
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:20,720
possibly but it's it's being awfully
 

1077
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,470
possibly but it's it's being awfully
generous to people's

1078
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:22,480
generous to people's
 

1079
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,870
generous to people's
ability to make bad decisions

1080
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:24,880
ability to make bad decisions
 

1081
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,789
ability to make bad decisions
for instance how many generations of the

1082
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:26,799
for instance how many generations of the
 

1083
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,870
for instance how many generations of the
holocaust would you allow

1084
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:28,880
holocaust would you allow
 

1085
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,630
holocaust would you allow
people to claim that everything that

1086
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:30,640
people to claim that everything that
 

1087
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,830
people to claim that everything that
went wrong

1088
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:31,840
went wrong
 

1089
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,669
went wrong
in the jewish community was as a result

1090
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:33,679
in the jewish community was as a result
 

1091
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,190
in the jewish community was as a result
of the holocaust

1092
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:35,200
of the holocaust
 

1093
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,549
of the holocaust
i mean is there some kind of term limit

1094
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:38,559
i mean is there some kind of term limit
 

1095
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,549
i mean is there some kind of term limit
on this i would have thought so

1096
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:40,559
on this i would have thought so
 

1097
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,230
on this i would have thought so
and i think most people probably think

1098
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:42,240
and i think most people probably think
 

1099
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,510
and i think most people probably think
that's over

1100
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:43,520
that's over
 

1101
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,909
that's over
i think the details matter they're the

1102
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:45,919
i think the details matter they're the
 

1103
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,590
i think the details matter they're the
and

1104
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:49,600

 

1105
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,310

um but it's very difficult

1106
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:52,320
um but it's very difficult
 

1107
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,190
um but it's very difficult
oh i enjoy swimming out in the ocean so

underneath in the darkness you're right

1112
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,120
underneath in the darkness you're right
 

1113
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,590
underneath in the darkness you're right
you're right to me

1114
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:03,600
you're right to me
 

1115
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,190
you're right to me
um okay it's really complicated calculus

1116
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,200
um okay it's really complicated calculus
 

1117
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,830
um okay it's really complicated calculus
with the holocaust of

1118
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:09,840
with the holocaust of
 

1119
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,669
with the holocaust of
so the argument in america is that

1120
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:13,679
so the argument in america is that
 

1121
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:14,710
so the argument in america is that
there are

1122
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:14,720
there are
 

1123
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,789
there are
there's deep institutional racism

1124
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:18,799
there's deep institutional racism
 

1125
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,950
there's deep institutional racism
against african americans that's rooted

1126
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:20,960
against african americans that's rooted
 

1127
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,870
against african americans that's rooted
in slavery

1128
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:22,880
in slavery
 

1129
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,350
in slavery
and

1130
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:25,360
and
 

1131
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,150
and
so however that calculus turns out that

1132
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:28,160
so however that calculus turns out that
 

1133
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,470
so however that calculus turns out that
calculation it still persists

1134
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:30,480
calculation it still persists
 

1135
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,029
calculation it still persists
in the culture and the institutions

1136
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:33,039
in the culture and the institutions
 

1137

in the allocation of resources in the

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,470
in the allocation of resources in the
way that we communicate in in this in

00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:38,480
way that we communicate in in this in
 

1141
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,150
way that we communicate in in this in
subtle ways in major ways all that kind

1142
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,160
subtle ways in major ways all that kind
 

1143
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,190
subtle ways in major ways all that kind
of stuff

1144
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:41,200
of stuff
 

1145
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,789
of stuff
um how is it possible to win or lose

1146
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:44,799
um how is it possible to win or lose
 

1147
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,110
um how is it possible to win or lose
that argument of how much institutional

1148
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:47,120
that argument of how much institutional
 

1149
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,750
that argument of how much institutional
racism there is that's rooted in

racism there is that's rooted in
 

1151
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,470
racism there is that's rooted in
in slavery is it a winnable it's it's an

00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:52,480
in slavery is it a winnable it's it's an
 

1153
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,470
in slavery is it a winnable it's it's an
unquantifiable argument

1154
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:54,480
unquantifiable argument
 

1155
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,110
unquantifiable argument
um and i'd i'd

1156

um and i'd i'd
 

1157
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,029
um and i'd i'd
i'd like to apply some shortcuts to some

yeah uh so not so let's draw a line now

2828
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:42,880
yeah uh so not so let's draw a line now
 

2829
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,270
yeah uh so not so let's draw a line now

so

2832
00:48:46,069 --> 00:48:46,079
so
 

2833
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,270
so
i think engineering is uh i'm uh sitting

2834
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:49,280
i think engineering is uh i'm uh sitting

you know if you if you said you'd like

00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,109

uh if you wanted to e

00:51:33,109 --> 00:51:33,119
uh if you wanted to e

something central to cancer thought or

2994
00:51:38,069 --> 00:51:38,079
something central to cancer thought or
 

2995
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,950
something central to cancer thought or
or hegel or something i mean that's not

2996
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:40,960
or hegel or something i mean that's not
 

2997
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,390
or hegel or something i mean that's not
popular

2998
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:42,400
popular
 

2999
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,790
popular
that what's popular is to take somebody

3000
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:44,800
that what's popular is to take somebody
 

3001
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,470
that what's popular is to take somebody
way down the line from that because

3002
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:46,480
way down the line from that because
 

3003
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,069
way down the line from that because
there's a feeling that that's all been

3004
00:51:48,069 --> 00:51:48,079
there's a feeling that that's all been
 

3005
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:49,750
there's a feeling that that's all been
done

3006
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:49,760
done
 

3007
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,990
done
so you take something way way way down

3008
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:52,000
so you take something way way way down
 

3009
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,589
so you take something way way way down
the line from that that's much less

3010
00:51:53,589 --> 00:51:53,599
the line from that that's much less
 

3011
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:55,270
the line from that that's much less
important and then you sort of play with

3012
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:55,280
important and then you sort of play with
 

3013
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,030
important and then you sort of play with
that

3014
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:57,040
that
 

3015
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,470
that
and i think most people anyone who's

3016
00:51:58,470 --> 00:51:58,480
and i think most people anyone who's
 

3017
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,390
and i think most people anyone who's
watching who's been in a philosophy

3018
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:00,400
watching who's been in a philosophy

nothing good has ever come from it

nothing good to push back is it is it

obvious that activism is a sign

3100
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:22,640
obvious that activism is a sign
 

3101
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,910
obvious that activism is a sign
of a flaw in a discipline so is isn't it

00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:25,920
of a flaw in a discipline so is isn't it
 

3103
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,670
of a flaw in a discipline so is isn't it
a sign of the death of the discipline

3104
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:27,680
a sign of the death of the discipline
 

3105
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,670
a sign of the death of the discipline
it's a sign that discipline's over

3106
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:29,680
it's a sign that discipline's over
 

3107
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,829
it's a sign that discipline's over
but isn't it a good goal to have for

you know some popularity in in the west
recently

5388
01:32:28,550 --> 01:32:28,560
recently
 

5389
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:31,110
recently
um not just recently yeah i mean he's

5390
01:32:31,110 --> 01:32:31,120
um not just recently yeah i mean he's
 

5391
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:33,669
um not just recently yeah i mean he's
had a resurgence recently yes resurgence

5392
01:32:33,669 --> 01:32:33,679
had a resurgence recently yes resurgence
 

5393
01:32:33,679 --> 01:32:34,790
had a resurgence recently yes resurgence
well that's because that's because

5394
01:32:34,790 --> 01:32:34,800
well that's because that's because
 

5395
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,470
well that's because that's because
whenever whenever things are seen to go

5396
01:32:36,470 --> 01:32:36,480
whenever whenever things are seen to go
 

5397
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:39,030
whenever whenever things are seen to go
wrong people reach for other

5398
01:32:39,030 --> 01:32:39,040
wrong people reach for other
 

5399
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,790
wrong people reach for other
options

5400
01:32:40,790 --> 01:32:40,800
options
 

5401
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,390
options
and when for instance it's very hard for

5402
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:42,400
and when for instance it's very hard for
 

5403
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:43,830
and when for instance it's very hard for
people to accumulate capital it's not

5404
01:32:43,830 --> 01:32:43,840
people to accumulate capital it's not
 

5405
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:44,790
people to accumulate capital it's not
obvious they're going to become

5406
01:32:44,790 --> 01:32:44,800
obvious they're going to become
 

5407
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:46,550
obvious they're going to become
capitalists

5408
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:46,560
capitalists
 

5409
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:48,790
capitalists
and so one thing that happens is people

5410
01:32:48,790 --> 01:32:48,800
and so one thing that happens is people
 

5411
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:50,229
and so one thing that happens is people
say let's look at the marxism thing

5412
01:32:50,229 --> 01:32:50,239
say let's look at the marxism thing
 

5413
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:52,629
say let's look at the marxism thing
again see if that's a viable goer

5414
01:32:52,629 --> 01:32:52,639
again see if that's a viable goer
 

5415
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:55,590
again see if that's a viable goer
and my argument would simply be

5416
01:32:55,590 --> 01:32:55,600
and my argument would simply be
 

5417
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:58,229
and my argument would simply be
point me to one place that's worked

5418
01:32:58,229 --> 01:32:58,239
point me to one place that's worked
 

5419
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:00,790
point me to one place that's worked
well the argument from the

5420
01:33:00,790 --> 01:33:00,800
well the argument from the
 

5421
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,229
well the argument from the
marxist or the

5422
01:33:02,229 --> 01:33:02,239
marxist or the
 

5423
01:33:02,239 --> 01:33:04,870
marxist or the
marxian economists is that

5424
01:33:04,870 --> 01:33:04,880
marxian economists is that
 

5425
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:07,430
marxian economists is that
we've only really tried it once the

5426
01:33:07,430 --> 01:33:07,440
we've only really tried it once the
 

5427
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:09,270
we've only really tried it once the
soviets tried it and then if there's a

5428
01:33:09,270 --> 01:33:09,280
soviets tried it and then if there's a
 

5429
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:11,590
soviets tried it and then if there's a
few people that kind of tried the soviet

5430
01:33:11,590 --> 01:33:11,600
few people that kind of tried the soviet
 

5431
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:13,750
few people that kind of tried the soviet
thing cuba tried it

5432
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:13,760
thing cuba tried it
 

5433
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:15,430
thing cuba tried it
well they they basically it's an

5434
01:33:15,430 --> 01:33:15,440
well they they basically it's an
 

5435
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:18,070
well they they basically it's an
offshoot of this show they tried soviet

5436
01:33:18,070 --> 01:33:18,080
offshoot of this show they tried soviet
 

5437
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:19,750
offshoot of this show they tried soviet
yes they've tried it tried it in

5438
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:19,760
yes they've tried it tried it in
 

5439
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:22,070
yes they've tried it tried it in
venezuela

5440
01:33:22,070 --> 01:33:22,080
venezuela
 

5441
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:24,709
venezuela
yes yes yes so but let's just let's just

5442
01:33:24,709 --> 01:33:24,719
yes yes yes so but let's just let's just
 

5443
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:25,669
yes yes yes so but let's just let's just
quickly say

5444
01:33:25,669 --> 01:33:25,679
quickly say
 

5445
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:27,750
quickly say
how did all these experiments go

5446
01:33:27,750 --> 01:33:27,760
how did all these experiments go
 

5447
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,669
how did all these experiments go
they they did not well they failed in

5448
01:33:29,669 --> 01:33:29,679
they they did not well they failed in
 

5449
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:31,750
they they did not well they failed in
fascinating ways they did but they

5450
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:31,760
fascinating ways they did but they
 

5451
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:33,830
fascinating ways they did but they
failed yes they said and

5452
01:33:33,830 --> 01:33:33,840
failed yes they said and
 

5453
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:36,870
failed yes they said and
we should stress so grossly failed

5454
01:33:36,870 --> 01:33:36,880
we should stress so grossly failed
 

5455
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:38,790
we should stress so grossly failed
so grossly failed that they threw

5456
01:33:38,790 --> 01:33:38,800
so grossly failed that they threw
 

5457
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:41,270
so grossly failed that they threw
millions and millions of people

5458
01:33:41,270 --> 01:33:41,280
millions and millions of people
 

5459
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:44,229
millions and millions of people
into completely thwarted lives that were

5460
01:33:44,229 --> 01:33:44,239
into completely thwarted lives that were
 

5461
01:33:44,239 --> 01:33:47,189
into completely thwarted lives that were
much shorter than they should have been

5462
01:33:47,189 --> 01:33:47,199
much shorter than they should have been
 

5463
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:50,550
much shorter than they should have been
yeah so the the lesson to learn there

5464
01:33:50,550 --> 01:33:50,560
yeah so the the lesson to learn there
 

5465
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:52,470
yeah so the the lesson to learn there
that you can learn several lessons one

5466
01:33:52,470 --> 01:33:52,480
that you can learn several lessons one
 

5467
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:55,030
that you can learn several lessons one
is that anything that smells like

5468
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:55,040
is that anything that smells like
 

5469
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:57,590
is that anything that smells like
marxism is going to lead

5470
01:33:57,590 --> 01:33:57,600
marxism is going to lead
 

5471
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:59,830
marxism is going to lead
to a lot of problems

5472
01:33:59,830 --> 01:33:59,840
to a lot of problems
 

5473
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:00,709
to a lot of problems
now

5474
01:34:00,709 --> 01:34:00,719
now
 

5475
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:02,870
now
another lesson could be well what is the

5476
01:34:02,870 --> 01:34:02,880
another lesson could be well what is the
 

5477
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:05,990
another lesson could be well what is the
fundamental idea that marx had

5478
01:34:05,990 --> 01:34:06,000
fundamental idea that marx had
 

5479
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,709
fundamental idea that marx had
he was criticizing capitalism

5480
01:34:08,709 --> 01:34:08,719
he was criticizing capitalism
 

5481
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:10,790
he was criticizing capitalism
and the flaws of capitalism so is it

5482
01:34:10,790 --> 01:34:10,800
and the flaws of capitalism so is it
 

5483
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:13,270
and the flaws of capitalism so is it
possible to do better than capitalism

5484
01:34:13,270 --> 01:34:13,280
possible to do better than capitalism
 

5485
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:15,430
possible to do better than capitalism
and that's if you take that spirit you

5486
01:34:15,430 --> 01:34:15,440
and that's if you take that spirit you
 

5487
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:17,350
and that's if you take that spirit you
start to wonder that might actually

5488
01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:17,360
start to wonder that might actually
 

5489
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,229
start to wonder that might actually
become relevant in i don't know 20 30 50

5490
01:34:20,229 --> 01:34:20,239
become relevant in i don't know 20 30 50
 

5491
01:34:20,239 --> 01:34:21,110
become relevant in i don't know 20 30 50
years

5492
01:34:21,110 --> 01:34:21,120
years
 

5493
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:23,430
years
when uh the qual the uh

5494
01:34:23,430 --> 01:34:23,440
when uh the qual the uh
 

5495
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:25,030
when uh the qual the uh
the machines start doing more and more

5496
01:34:25,030 --> 01:34:25,040
the machines start doing more and more
 

5497
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:26,470
the machines start doing more and more
of the labor all those kinds of things

5498
01:34:26,470 --> 01:34:26,480
of the labor all those kinds of things
 

5499
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:28,229
of the labor all those kinds of things
you start to ask questions if i finally

5500
01:34:28,229 --> 01:34:28,239
you start to ask questions if i finally
 

5501
01:34:28,239 --> 01:34:30,229
you start to ask questions if i finally
might get to marx's dream of what the

5502
01:34:30,229 --> 01:34:30,239
might get to marx's dream of what the
 

5503
01:34:30,239 --> 01:34:32,870
might get to marx's dream of what the
average day would look like yes

5504
01:34:32,870 --> 01:34:32,880
average day would look like yes
 

5505
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,709
average day would look like yes
what yeah well there's gonna be an awful

5506
01:34:34,709 --> 01:34:34,719
what yeah well there's gonna be an awful
 

5507
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:38,070
what yeah well there's gonna be an awful
lot of literary criticism then

5508
01:34:38,070 --> 01:34:38,080
lot of literary criticism then
 

5509
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,350
lot of literary criticism then
if you remember that

5510
01:34:39,350 --> 01:34:39,360
if you remember that
 

5511
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,550
if you remember that
said that we would be doing in the

5512
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:40,560
said that we would be doing in the
 

5513
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,550
said that we would be doing in the
evenings the labor in the evening well

5514
01:34:42,550 --> 01:34:42,560
evenings the labor in the evening well
 

5515
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:44,550
evenings the labor in the evening well
he didn't know twitter was a thing or

5516
01:34:44,550 --> 01:34:44,560
he didn't know twitter was a thing or
 

5517

netflix so he would he would change
 

5519

netflix so he would he would change
are there things we could learn from

5520
01:34:48,870 --> 01:34:48,880
are there things we could learn from
 

5521
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:49,990
are there things we could learn from
marx

5522
01:34:49,990 --> 01:34:50,000
marx
 

5523
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,149
marx
plausibly possibly i can't think of

5524
01:34:52,149 --> 01:34:52,159
plausibly possibly i can't think of
 

5525
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:55,189
plausibly possibly i can't think of
anything myself off hand but um

5526
01:34:55,189 --> 01:34:55,199

standing oh we've also got this idea

5876
01:40:57,270 --> 01:40:57,280
standing oh we've also got this idea
 

5877
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:58,790
standing oh we've also got this idea
from the 20th century still about

5878
01:40:58,790 --> 01:40:58,800
from the 20th century still about
 

5879
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,310
from the 20th century still about
marxism

marxism
 

5881
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:02,390
marxism
or the 19th and 20th centuries

5882
01:41:02,390 --> 01:41:02,400
or the 19th and 20th centuries
 

5883
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:05,189
or the 19th and 20th centuries
and no no

5884
01:41:05,189 --> 01:41:05,199
and no no
 

5885
01:41:05,199 --> 01:41:07,350
and no no
you you will not have the entire

5886
01:41:07,350 --> 01:41:07,360
you you will not have the entire
 

5887
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:09,590
you you will not have the entire
landscape deracinated

5888
01:41:09,590 --> 01:41:09,600
landscape deracinated
 

5889
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:12,870
landscape deracinated
and then the worst ideas tried again

5890
01:41:12,870 --> 01:41:12,880
and then the worst ideas tried again
 

5891
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:15,030
and then the worst ideas tried again
so basically destroy all of history and

5892
01:41:15,030 --> 01:41:15,040
so basically destroy all of history and
 

5893
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:16,550
so basically destroy all of history and
the lessons learned from history and

5894
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:16,560
the lessons learned from history and
 

5895
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:18,629
the lessons learned from history and
then start from scratch and then then

5896
01:41:18,629 --> 01:41:18,639
then start from scratch and then then
 

5897
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:20,629
then start from scratch and then then
it's completely any idea can work and

5898
01:41:20,629 --> 01:41:20,639
it's completely any idea can work and
 

5899
01:41:20,639 --> 01:41:22,790
it's completely any idea can work and
then you could just take whatever well

5900
01:41:22,790 --> 01:41:22,800
then you could just take whatever well
 

5901
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:23,990
then you could just take whatever well
and the thing is there are always some

5902
01:41:23,990 --> 01:41:24,000
and the thing is there are always some
 

5903
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,990
and the thing is there are always some
people with pre-preferred ideas and i

5904
01:41:25,990 --> 01:41:26,000
people with pre-preferred ideas and i
 

5905
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:26,950
people with pre-preferred ideas and i
mentioned this also with the

5906
01:41:26,950 --> 01:41:26,960
mentioned this also with the
 

5907
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:28,709
mentioned this also with the
post-colonialists the post-colonialists

5908
01:41:28,709 --> 01:41:28,719
post-colonialists the post-colonialists
 

5909
01:41:28,719 --> 01:41:30,470
post-colonialists the post-colonialists
were really interesting

5910
01:41:30,470 --> 01:41:30,480
were really interesting
 

5911
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:31,750
were really interesting
because when the european powers were

5912
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:31,760
because when the european powers were
 

5913
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:33,830
because when the european powers were
removing were removing from africa in

5914
01:41:33,830 --> 01:41:33,840
removing were removing from africa in
 

5915
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:35,590
removing were removing from africa in
the far east

5916
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:35,600
the far east
 

5917
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:38,310
the far east
post-colonial movements had one obvious

5918
01:41:38,310 --> 01:41:38,320
post-colonial movements had one obvious
 

5919
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:40,310
post-colonial movements had one obvious
move they could have done which was to

5920
01:41:40,310 --> 01:41:40,320
move they could have done which was to
 

5921
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:41,270
move they could have done which was to
say

5922
01:41:41,270 --> 01:41:41,280
say
 

5923
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:43,270
say
since the european powers have left we

5924
01:41:43,270 --> 01:41:43,280
since the european powers have left we
 

5925
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:46,470
since the european powers have left we
will return to a pre-colonial life which

5926
01:41:46,470 --> 01:41:46,480
will return to a pre-colonial life which
 

5927
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:47,669
will return to a pre-colonial life which
in some other places would have been

5928
01:41:47,669 --> 01:41:47,679
in some other places would have been
 

5929
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:50,070
in some other places would have been
returning to slave markets and slave

5930
01:41:50,070 --> 01:41:50,080
returning to slave markets and slave
 

5931
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:51,669
returning to slave markets and slave
ownership and slave selling and much

5932
01:41:51,669 --> 01:41:51,679
ownership and slave selling and much
 

5933
01:41:51,679 --> 01:41:54,149
ownership and slave selling and much
more but put that aside for a second

5934
01:41:54,149 --> 01:41:54,159
more but put that aside for a second
 

5935
01:41:54,159 --> 01:41:55,270
more but put that aside for a second
they could have said we have an

5936
01:41:55,270 --> 01:41:55,280
they could have said we have an
 

5937
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:57,030
they could have said we have an
indigenous culture which we will return

5938
01:41:57,030 --> 01:41:57,040
indigenous culture which we will return
 

5939
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:57,990
indigenous culture which we will return
to

5940
01:41:57,990 --> 01:41:58,000
to
 

5941
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,390
to
almost uniformly in the post-colonial

5942
01:42:00,390 --> 01:42:00,400
almost uniformly in the post-colonial
 

5943
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:04,070
almost uniformly in the post-colonial
era you had figures like franz fanon you

5944
01:42:04,070 --> 01:42:04,080
era you had figures like franz fanon you
 

5945
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:06,390
era you had figures like franz fanon you
had european intellectuals like sartre

5946
01:42:06,390 --> 01:42:06,400
had european intellectuals like sartre
 

5947
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:07,910
had european intellectuals like sartre
who said

5948
01:42:07,910 --> 01:42:07,920
who said
 

5949
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:09,830
who said
the western powers are retreating from

5950
01:42:09,830 --> 01:42:09,840
the western powers are retreating from
 

5951
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:11,510
the western powers are retreating from
these countries and therefore we should

5952
01:42:11,510 --> 01:42:11,520
these countries and therefore we should
 

5953
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:13,590
these countries and therefore we should
institute in these countries what but

5954
01:42:13,590 --> 01:42:13,600
institute in these countries what but
 

5955
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:16,870
institute in these countries what but

5957
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:19,109

well it's not obvious to me that like

5958
01:42:19,109 --> 01:42:19,119
well it's not obvious to me that like
 

5959
01:42:19,119 --> 01:42:20,629
well it's not obvious to me that like
the bad ideas would be the ones that

5960
01:42:20,629 --> 01:42:20,639
the bad ideas would be the ones that
 

5961
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:22,790
the bad ideas would be the ones that
emerge but it's more likely the bad

5962
01:42:22,790 --> 01:42:22,800
emerge but it's more likely the bad
 

5963
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:23,990
emerge but it's more likely the bad
ideas would emerge in this kind of

5964
01:42:23,990 --> 01:42:24,000
ideas would emerge in this kind of
 

5965
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,390
ideas would emerge in this kind of
context when you erase history

5966
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:26,400
context when you erase history
 

5967
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:27,750

well there's a sense there's an
appealing sense

6162
01:45:46,870 --> 01:45:46,880
appealing sense
 

6163
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:49,189
appealing sense
okay every ideology has an appealing

6164
01:45:49,189 --> 01:45:49,199
okay every ideology has an appealing
 

6165
01:45:49,199 --> 01:45:51,030
okay every ideology has an appealing
narrative behind it

6166
01:45:51,030 --> 01:45:51,040
narrative behind it
 

6167
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:54,149
narrative behind it
that sells the ideology so for socialism

6168
01:45:54,149 --> 01:45:54,159
that sells the ideology so for socialism
 

6169
01:45:54,159 --> 01:45:57,030
that sells the ideology so for socialism
for communism is that there's a

6170
01:45:57,030 --> 01:45:57,040
for communism is that there's a
 

6171
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:59,590
for communism is that there's a
it seems unfair that the working class

6172
01:45:59,590 --> 01:45:59,600
it seems unfair that the working class
 

6173
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:01,590
it seems unfair that the working class
does all of this work

6174
01:46:01,590 --> 01:46:01,600
does all of this work
 

6175
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:04,149
does all of this work
and gets only a fraction

6176
01:46:04,149 --> 01:46:04,159
and gets only a fraction
 

6177
01:46:04,159 --> 01:46:06,950
and gets only a fraction
of the output it just seems unfair

6178
01:46:06,950 --> 01:46:06,960
of the output it just seems unfair
 

6179
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:08,470
of the output it just seems unfair
so you want to make they do get a

6180
01:46:08,470 --> 01:46:08,480
so you want to make they do get a
 

6181
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:10,550
so you want to make they do get a
fraction of that but yes

6182
01:46:10,550 --> 01:46:10,560
fraction of that but yes
 

6183
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:13,189
fraction of that but yes
yes and so

6184
01:46:13,189 --> 01:46:13,199
yes and so
 

6185
01:46:13,199 --> 01:46:15,510
yes and so
it seems to be more fair if we increase

6186
01:46:15,510 --> 01:46:15,520
it seems to be more fair if we increase
 

6187
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:18,149
it seems to be more fair if we increase
that if the workers own

6188
01:46:18,149 --> 01:46:18,159
that if the workers own
 

6189
01:46:18,159 --> 01:46:21,350
that if the workers own
um all all of the value of their output

6190
01:46:21,350 --> 01:46:21,360
um all all of the value of their output
 

6191
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:22,229
um all all of the value of their output
and

6192
01:46:22,229 --> 01:46:22,239
and
 

6193
01:46:22,239 --> 01:46:24,310
and
well the things that are more fair seems

6194
01:46:24,310 --> 01:46:24,320
well the things that are more fair seems
 

6195
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:25,750
well the things that are more fair seems
to be

6196
01:46:25,750 --> 01:46:25,760
to be
 

6197
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:27,910
to be
a good thing i'd say well yeah i mean

6198
01:46:27,910 --> 01:46:27,920
a good thing i'd say well yeah i mean
 

6199
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:29,910
a good thing i'd say well yeah i mean
fairness is is

6200
01:46:29,910 --> 01:46:29,920
fairness is is
 

6201
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:32,310
fairness is is
i like fairness as well

6202
01:46:32,310 --> 01:46:32,320
i like fairness as well
 

6203
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:34,149
i like fairness as well
no i much prefer fairness because it's a

6204
01:46:34,149 --> 01:46:34,159
no i much prefer fairness because it's a
 

6205
01:46:34,159 --> 01:46:36,070
no i much prefer fairness because it's a
much easier thing to

6206
01:46:36,070 --> 01:46:36,080
much easier thing to
 

6207
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:37,590
much easier thing to
try to work out it's quite amorphous

6208
01:46:37,590 --> 01:46:37,600
try to work out it's quite amorphous
 

6209
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:39,109
try to work out it's quite amorphous
itself for the concept but everyone can

6210
01:46:39,109 --> 01:46:39,119
itself for the concept but everyone can
 

6211
01:46:39,119 --> 01:46:40,629
itself for the concept but everyone can
recognize it

6212
01:46:40,629 --> 01:46:40,639
recognize it
 

6213
01:46:40,639 --> 01:46:43,109
recognize it
so for instance

6214
01:46:43,109 --> 01:46:43,119
so for instance
 

6215
01:46:43,119 --> 01:46:44,709
so for instance
um

6216
01:46:44,709 --> 01:46:44,719
um
 

6217
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:46,870
um
should the boss of the company

6218
01:46:46,870 --> 01:46:46,880
should the boss of the company
 

6219
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:48,070
should the boss of the company
earn

6220
01:46:48,070 --> 01:46:48,080
earn
 

6221
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:50,629
earn
a million times that of the lowest paid

6222
01:46:50,629 --> 01:46:50,639
a million times that of the lowest paid
 

6223
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:53,669
a million times that of the lowest paid
employee doesn't seem fair

6224
01:46:53,669 --> 01:46:53,679
employee doesn't seem fair
 

6225
01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:55,669
employee doesn't seem fair
should they earn

6226
01:46:55,669 --> 01:46:55,679
should they earn
 

6227
01:46:55,679 --> 01:46:59,030
should they earn
maybe five or ten times the

6228
01:46:59,030 --> 01:46:59,040
maybe five or ten times the
 

6229
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:01,510
maybe five or ten times the
the salary of the lowest yeah possibly

6230
01:47:01,510 --> 01:47:01,520
the salary of the lowest yeah possibly
 

6231
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:03,189
the salary of the lowest yeah possibly
that that could be fair

6232
01:47:03,189 --> 01:47:03,199
that that could be fair
 

6233
01:47:03,199 --> 01:47:04,870
that that could be fair
there are certain sort of multiples

6234
01:47:04,870 --> 01:47:04,880
there are certain sort of multiples
 

6235
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:07,189
there are certain sort of multiples
which are within

6236
01:47:07,189 --> 01:47:07,199
which are within
 

6237
01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:09,510
which are within
the bounds of

6238
01:47:09,510 --> 01:47:09,520
the bounds of
 

6239
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:10,790
the bounds of
you know

6240
01:47:10,790 --> 01:47:10,800
you know
 

6241
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,470
you know
reasonableness

6242
01:47:12,470 --> 01:47:12,480
reasonableness
 

6243
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:15,669
reasonableness
i i think actually that's the

6244
01:47:15,669 --> 01:47:15,679
i i think actually that's the
 

6245
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:17,590
i i think actually that's the
that's the much bigger problem in

6246
01:47:17,590 --> 01:47:17,600
that's the much bigger problem in
 

6247
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:19,430
that's the much bigger problem in
capitalism at the moment as i see it is

6248
01:47:19,430 --> 01:47:19,440
capitalism at the moment as i see it is
 

6249
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:21,109
capitalism at the moment as i see it is
is the is the

6250
01:47:21,109 --> 01:47:21,119
is the is the
 

6251
01:47:21,119 --> 01:47:23,990
is the is the
not untrue perception that a tiny number

6252
01:47:23,990 --> 01:47:24,000
not untrue perception that a tiny number
 

6253
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,629
not untrue perception that a tiny number
of people get a lot of the accrue a lot

6254
01:47:26,629 --> 01:47:26,639
of people get a lot of the accrue a lot
 

6255
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:27,510
of people get a lot of the accrue a lot
of the

6256
01:47:27,510 --> 01:47:27,520
of the
 

6257
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:28,550
of the
benefits

6258
01:47:28,550 --> 01:47:28,560
benefits
 

6259
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:29,830
benefits
and that

6260
01:47:29,830 --> 01:47:29,840
and that
 

6261
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:33,189
and that
the

6262
01:47:33,189 --> 01:47:33,199

 

6263
01:47:33,199 --> 01:47:35,270

the the bit in the middle

6264
01:47:35,270 --> 01:47:35,280
the the bit in the middle
 

6265
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:38,070
the the bit in the middle
has become increasingly squeezed and is

6266
01:47:38,070 --> 01:47:38,080
has become increasingly squeezed and is
 

6267
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:39,750
has become increasingly squeezed and is
a danger always of falling all the way

6268
01:47:39,750 --> 01:47:39,760
a danger always of falling all the way
 

6269
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:41,510
a danger always of falling all the way
down to the bottom i mean i think in the

6270
01:47:41,510 --> 01:47:41,520
down to the bottom i mean i think in the
 

6271
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:42,870
down to the bottom i mean i think in the
snakes and ladders of american

6272
01:47:42,870 --> 01:47:42,880
snakes and ladders of american
 

6273

snakes and ladders of american
capitalism for instance it's

6274
01:47:45,270 --> 01:47:45,280
capitalism for instance it's
 

6275
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:48,470
capitalism for instance it's
it's a correct perception to say that

6276
01:47:48,470 --> 01:47:48,480
it's a correct perception to say that
 

6277
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:52,229
it's a correct perception to say that
the snakes go down awfully far

6278
01:47:52,229 --> 01:47:52,239
the snakes go down awfully far
 

6279
01:47:52,239 --> 01:47:54,470
the snakes go down awfully far
if you tread on the snake

6280
01:47:54,470 --> 01:47:54,480
if you tread on the snake
 

6281
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:56,550
if you tread on the snake
you can plummet an awfully long way in

6282
01:47:56,550 --> 01:47:56,560
you can plummet an awfully long way in
 

6283
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:58,229
you can plummet an awfully long way in
america

6284

and the deal in the game was that the

6286
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:01,360
and the deal in the game was that the
 

6287
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:02,830
and the deal in the game was that the
ladders took you

6288
01:48:02,830 --> 01:48:02,840
ladders took you
 

6289
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:05,350
ladders took you
high and there's a perception and again

6290
01:48:05,350 --> 01:48:05,360
high and there's a perception and again
 

6291
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:07,350
high and there's a perception and again
it's not entirely wrong

6292
01:48:07,350 --> 01:48:07,360
it's not entirely wrong
 

6293
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:09,189
it's not entirely wrong
that the ladders system on the board is

6294
01:48:09,189 --> 01:48:09,199
that the ladders system on the board is
 

6295
01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:11,750
that the ladders system on the board is
kind of broken

6296
01:48:11,750 --> 01:48:11,760
kind of broken
 

6297
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:13,750
kind of broken
so what you're saying is you're

friction yeah
 

6863
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:01,189
friction yeah
that sometimes

6864
01:58:01,189 --> 01:58:01,199

truth and instead just look for the
 

6871
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:11,270
truth and instead just look for the
friction could do

friction could do
 

6873
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:13,030

early in my career i realized that for
instance

6882
01:58:20,390 --> 01:58:20,400
instance
 

6883
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:21,589
instance
i didn't want to

6884
01:58:21,589 --> 01:58:21,599

to make on enemies unnecessarily
 

6887
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:26,550
to make on enemies unnecessarily
any more than strictly necessary because

6888
01:58:26,550 --> 01:58:26,560
any more than strictly necessary because
 

6889
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:28,390
any more than strictly necessary because
there was a very large number of already

6890
01:58:28,390 --> 01:58:28,400
there was a very large number of already
 

6891
01:58:28,400 --> 01:58:30,070
there was a very large number of already
necessary enemies

6892
01:58:30,070 --> 01:58:30,080
necessary enemies
 

6893
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:31,350
necessary enemies
and i remember once i went into the

6894
01:58:31,350 --> 01:58:31,360
and i remember once i went into the
 

6895
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:34,229
and i remember once i went into the
details but i already had one sort of

6896
01:58:34,229 --> 01:58:34,239
details but i already had one sort of
 

6897
01:58:34,239 --> 01:58:35,910
details but i already had one sort of
thing i'd done that way and then another

6898
01:58:35,910 --> 01:58:35,920
thing i'd done that way and then another
 

6899
01:58:35,920 --> 01:58:37,270
thing i'd done that way and then another
thing came out i just thought i can't i

and i remember thinking don't be the
 

6905
01:58:41,679 --> 01:58:44,390
and i remember thinking don't be the
sort of person who's forever creating

6906
01:58:44,390 --> 01:58:44,400
sort of person who's forever creating
 

6907
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:45,990
sort of person who's forever creating
storms

wouldn't fall into the trap you

6922

wouldn't fall into the trap you
described two reasons

6924
01:59:03,589 --> 01:59:03,599
described two reasons
 

6925
01:59:03,599 --> 01:59:04,870
described two reasons
i mean one is that i don't think of

6926
01:59:04,870 --> 01:59:04,880
i mean one is that i don't think of
 

6927
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:08,229
i mean one is that i don't think of
myself as a wildly intelligent person

6928
01:59:08,229 --> 01:59:08,239
myself as a wildly intelligent person
 

6929
01:59:08,239 --> 01:59:11,350
myself as a wildly intelligent person
um partly because i'm very very aware of

01:59:11,350 --> 01:59:11,360
um partly because i'm very very aware of
 

6931
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:13,750
um partly because i'm very very aware of
things i know nothing about

6932
01:59:13,750 --> 01:59:13,760
things i know nothing about
 

6933
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:15,589
things i know nothing about
i mean for instance i have an

that's possible but it's also
 

7951
02:16:18,560 --> 02:16:20,310
that's possible but it's also

resentment is a thing that destroys you
 

8011
02:17:24,719 --> 02:17:27,349
resentment is a thing that destroys you
from within so i just

8012
02:17:27,349 --> 02:17:27,359
from within so i just
 

8013
02:17:27,359 --> 02:17:30,389
from within so i just
feel that people will um long for that

8014
02:17:30,389 --> 02:17:30,399
feel that people will um long for that
 

8015
02:17:30,399 --> 02:17:32,629
feel that people will um long for that
and will find that that's that's the

8016
02:17:32,629 --> 02:17:32,639
and will find that that's that's the
 

8017
02:17:32,639 --> 02:17:34,469
and will find that that's that's the
american way some of the division that

8018
02:17:34,469 --> 02:17:34,479
american way some of the division that
 

8019
02:17:34,479 --> 02:17:36,950
american way some of the division that

the moment he was told that his friend's

8736
02:29:38,870 --> 02:29:38,880
the moment he was told that his friend's
 

8737
02:29:38,880 --> 02:29:40,389
the moment he was told that his friend's
death a tiny bit of him thought i could

8738
02:29:40,389 --> 02:29:40,399
death a tiny bit of him thought i could
 

8739
02:29:40,399 --> 02:29:41,990
death a tiny bit of him thought i could
use this for poem

8740
02:29:41,990 --> 02:29:42,000
use this for poem
 

8741
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:43,349
use this for poem
and he did and the poem was wonderful

8742
02:29:43,349 --> 02:29:43,359
and he did and the poem was wonderful
 

8743
02:29:43,359 --> 02:29:45,030
and he did and the poem was wonderful
but there's always that slight guilt for

8744
02:29:45,030 --> 02:29:45,040
but there's always that slight guilt for
 

8745
02:29:45,040 --> 02:29:46,230
but there's always that slight guilt for
writers of

8746
02:29:46,230 --> 02:29:46,240
writers of
 

8747
02:29:46,240 --> 02:29:48,070
writers of
am i going to use that

8748
02:29:48,070 --> 02:29:48,080
am i going to use that
 

8749
02:29:48,080 --> 02:29:50,469
am i going to use that
anyhow that's a divergence life is full

8750
02:29:50,469 --> 02:29:50,479
anyhow that's a divergence life is full
 

8751
02:29:50,479 --> 02:29:52,070
anyhow that's a divergence life is full
of guilty pleasures and i think that's

8752
02:29:52,070 --> 02:29:52,080
of guilty pleasures and i think that's
 

8753
02:29:52,080 --> 02:29:53,670
of guilty pleasures and i think that's
one of them because if you feel that

8754
02:29:53,670 --> 02:29:53,680
one of them because if you feel that
 

8755
02:29:53,680 --> 02:29:54,630
one of them because if you feel that
guilt

8756
02:29:54,630 --> 02:29:54,640
guilt
 

8757
02:29:54,640 --> 02:29:55,510
guilt
really

8758
02:29:55,510 --> 02:29:55,520
really
 

8759
02:29:55,520 --> 02:29:57,110
really
what you're doing is you're capturing

8760
02:29:57,110 --> 02:29:57,120
what you're doing is you're capturing
 

8761
02:29:57,120 --> 02:29:59,110
what you're doing is you're capturing
that moment and you're going to impact

8762
02:29:59,110 --> 02:29:59,120
that moment and you're going to impact
 

8763
02:29:59,120 --> 02:30:01,349
that moment and you're going to impact
the lives of many many people

8764
02:30:01,349 --> 02:30:01,359
the lives of many many people
 

8765
02:30:01,359 --> 02:30:02,790
the lives of many many people
by writing about that moment because

8766
02:30:02,790 --> 02:30:02,800
by writing about that moment because
 

8767
02:30:02,800 --> 02:30:04,870
by writing about that moment because
it's going to stimulate something that

8768
02:30:04,870 --> 02:30:04,880
it's going to stimulate something that
 

8769
02:30:04,880 --> 02:30:06,550
it's going to stimulate something that
resonates with those people because they

8770
02:30:06,550 --> 02:30:06,560
resonates with those people because they
 

8771
02:30:06,560 --> 02:30:08,790
resonates with those people because they
had similar kinds of memories about a

8772
02:30:08,790 --> 02:30:08,800
had similar kinds of memories about a
 

8773
02:30:08,800 --> 02:30:10,790
had similar kinds of memories about a
yes and a passion towards somebody that

8774
02:30:10,790 --> 02:30:10,800
yes and a passion towards somebody that
 

8775
02:30:10,800 --> 02:30:12,230
yes and a passion towards somebody that
they had to lose so

8776
02:30:12,230 --> 02:30:12,240
they had to lose so
 

8777
02:30:12,240 --> 02:30:14,070
they had to lose so
don't you know yes but there is a good

8778
02:30:14,070 --> 02:30:14,080
don't you know yes but there is a good
 

8779
02:30:14,080 --> 02:30:16,150
don't you know yes but there is a good
sign maybe perhaps the more obvious

8780
02:30:16,150 --> 02:30:16,160
sign maybe perhaps the more obvious
 

8781
02:30:16,160 --> 02:30:18,550
sign maybe perhaps the more obvious
perhaps problem is um

8782
02:30:18,550 --> 02:30:18,560
perhaps problem is um
 

8783
02:30:18,560 --> 02:30:20,950
perhaps problem is um
reporting from war zones or bad places

8784
02:30:20,950 --> 02:30:20,960
reporting from war zones or bad places
 

8785
02:30:20,960 --> 02:30:23,990
reporting from war zones or bad places
and wanting to find bad stories because

8786
02:30:23,990 --> 02:30:24,000
and wanting to find bad stories because
 

8787
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:25,750
and wanting to find bad stories because
it's useful and there's there is a

8788
02:30:25,750 --> 02:30:25,760
it's useful and there's there is a
 

8789
02:30:25,760 --> 02:30:27,830
it's useful and there's there is a
definite guilt you get from that sort of

8790
02:30:27,830 --> 02:30:27,840
definite guilt you get from that sort of
 

8791
02:30:27,840 --> 02:30:29,590
definite guilt you get from that sort of
thing like the worse the situation the

8792
02:30:29,590 --> 02:30:29,600
thing like the worse the situation the
 

8793
02:30:29,600 --> 02:30:32,950
thing like the worse the situation the
more useful and anyhow um

8794
02:30:32,950 --> 02:30:32,960
more useful and anyhow um
 

8795
02:30:32,960 --> 02:30:34,309
more useful and anyhow um
no so that's that's sort of the only

8796
02:30:34,309 --> 02:30:34,319
no so that's that's sort of the only
 

8797
02:30:34,319 --> 02:30:35,590
no so that's that's sort of the only
difference that happens from growing up

8798
02:30:35,590 --> 02:30:35,600
difference that happens from growing up
 

8799
02:30:35,600 --> 02:30:37,670
difference that happens from growing up
being gay and it means that

8800
02:30:37,670 --> 02:30:37,680
being gay and it means that
 

8801
02:30:37,680 --> 02:30:38,550
being gay and it means that
most

8802
02:30:38,550 --> 02:30:38,560
most
 

8803
02:30:38,560 --> 02:30:40,430
most
certainly in my generation most gay men

8804
02:30:40,430 --> 02:30:40,440
certainly in my generation most gay men
 

8805
02:30:40,440 --> 02:30:41,590
certainly in my generation most gay men

came to

8808
02:30:42,710 --> 02:30:42,720
came to
 

8809
02:30:42,720 --> 02:30:46,070
came to
sexual or romantic maturity later and

8810
02:30:46,070 --> 02:30:46,080
sexual or romantic maturity later and
 

8811
02:30:46,080 --> 02:30:49,190
sexual or romantic maturity later and
there's lots of explanations of that um

8812
02:30:49,190 --> 02:30:49,200
there's lots of explanations of that um
 

8813
02:30:49,200 --> 02:30:51,910
there's lots of explanations of that um
maybe being one of the reasons for

8814
02:30:51,910 --> 02:30:51,920
maybe being one of the reasons for
 

8815
02:30:51,920 --> 02:30:53,830
maybe being one of the reasons for
perceived or otherwise promiscuity among

8816
02:30:53,830 --> 02:30:53,840
perceived or otherwise promiscuity among
 

8817
02:30:53,840 --> 02:30:55,030
perceived or otherwise promiscuity among
gay men

8818
02:30:55,030 --> 02:30:55,040
gay men
 

8819
02:30:55,040 --> 02:30:56,870
gay men
which is i think more easily persuaded

8820
02:30:56,870 --> 02:30:56,880
which is i think more easily persuaded
 

8821
02:30:56,880 --> 02:30:57,990
which is i think more easily persuaded
by the fact that

8822
02:30:57,990 --> 02:30:58,000
by the fact that
 

8823
02:30:58,000 --> 02:30:59,590
by the fact that
gay men behave like

8824
02:30:59,590 --> 02:30:59,600
gay men behave like
 

8825
02:30:59,600 --> 02:31:03,990
gay men behave like
men would if women were men

8826
02:31:03,990 --> 02:31:04,000

 

8827
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,950

that's that's one explanation but it it

8828
02:31:06,950 --> 02:31:06,960
that's that's one explanation but it it
 

8829
02:31:06,960 --> 02:31:08,710
that's that's one explanation but it it
it's both a feature and a bug that you

8830
02:31:08,710 --> 02:31:08,720
it's both a feature and a bug that you
 

8831
02:31:08,720 --> 02:31:10,309
it's both a feature and a bug that you
come to

8832
02:31:10,309 --> 02:31:10,319
come to
 

8833
02:31:10,319 --> 02:31:12,710
come to
sexual flourishing later in life that

8834
02:31:12,710 --> 02:31:12,720
sexual flourishing later in life that
 

8835
02:31:12,720 --> 02:31:15,429
sexual flourishing later in life that
could be seen as a yeah

8836
02:31:15,429 --> 02:31:15,439
could be seen as a yeah
 

8837
02:31:15,439 --> 02:31:16,710
could be seen as a yeah
in the trajectory of human life that

8838
02:31:16,710 --> 02:31:16,720
in the trajectory of human life that
 

8839
02:31:16,720 --> 02:31:19,110
in the trajectory of human life that
could be a positive or negative yeah but

8840
02:31:19,110 --> 02:31:19,120
could be a positive or negative yeah but
 

8841
02:31:19,120 --> 02:31:21,510
could be a positive or negative yeah but
what's broadly speaking is the role of

8842
02:31:21,510 --> 02:31:21,520
what's broadly speaking is the role of
 

8843
02:31:21,520 --> 02:31:25,750
what's broadly speaking is the role of
love in the human condition douglas

8844
02:31:25,750 --> 02:31:25,760
love in the human condition douglas
 

8845
02:31:25,760 --> 02:31:27,190
love in the human condition douglas
well it's the nearest thing we have to

8846
02:31:27,190 --> 02:31:27,200
well it's the nearest thing we have to
 

8847
02:31:27,200 --> 02:31:29,910
well it's the nearest thing we have to
finding the point

8848
02:31:29,910 --> 02:31:29,920

 

8849
02:31:29,920 --> 02:31:31,590

what what is the point what's what's the

8850
02:31:31,590 --> 02:31:31,600
what what is the point what's what's the
 

8851
02:31:31,600 --> 02:31:33,590
what what is the point what's what's the
meaning of life let's go there so what's

8852
02:31:33,590 --> 02:31:33,600
meaning of life let's go there so what's
 

8853
02:31:33,600 --> 02:31:35,990
meaning of life let's go there so what's
the meaning is a hard one of course

8854
02:31:35,990 --> 02:31:36,000
the meaning is a hard one of course
 

8855
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:40,070
the meaning is a hard one of course
where is the meaning is slightly easier

8856
02:31:40,070 --> 02:31:40,080

 

8857
02:31:40,080 --> 02:31:42,389

um and i'd say that everyone can find

8858
02:31:42,389 --> 02:31:42,399
um and i'd say that everyone can find
 

8859
02:31:42,399 --> 02:31:43,270
um and i'd say that everyone can find
that

8860
02:31:43,270 --> 02:31:43,280
that
 

8861
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:45,110
that
um you gravitate towards the places you

8862
02:31:45,110 --> 02:31:45,120
um you gravitate towards the places you
 

8863
02:31:45,120 --> 02:31:46,870
um you gravitate towards the places you
find meaning

8864
02:31:46,870 --> 02:31:46,880
find meaning
 

8865
02:31:46,880 --> 02:31:48,230
find meaning
now there's a conservative answer to

8866
02:31:48,230 --> 02:31:48,240
now there's a conservative answer to
 

8867
02:31:48,240 --> 02:31:49,910
now there's a conservative answer to
this which is quite useful and it's

8868
02:31:49,910 --> 02:31:49,920
this which is quite useful and it's
 

8869
02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:51,429
this which is quite useful and it's
certainly more useful than any others

8870
02:31:51,429 --> 02:31:51,439
certainly more useful than any others
 

8871
02:31:51,439 --> 02:31:53,110
certainly more useful than any others
because the conservative answer is find

8872
02:31:53,110 --> 02:31:53,120
because the conservative answer is find
 

8873
02:31:53,120 --> 02:31:54,309
because the conservative answer is find
meaning where people have found it

8874
02:31:54,309 --> 02:31:54,319
meaning where people have found it
 

8875
02:31:54,319 --> 02:31:56,070
meaning where people have found it
before

8876
02:31:56,070 --> 02:31:56,080
before
 

8877
02:31:56,080 --> 02:31:59,030
before
which is a very very good answer yeah

8878
02:31:59,030 --> 02:31:59,040
which is a very very good answer yeah
 

8879
02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:01,110
which is a very very good answer yeah
if if your ancestors are found meaning

8880
02:32:01,110 --> 02:32:01,120
if if your ancestors are found meaning

02:32:16,399 --> 02:32:18,230
um
much more sensible than saying hey i

02:32:18,230 --> 02:32:18,240
much more sensible than saying hey i
 

8895
02:32:18,240 --> 02:32:22,830
much more sensible than saying hey i
don't know discover new ways of meaning
