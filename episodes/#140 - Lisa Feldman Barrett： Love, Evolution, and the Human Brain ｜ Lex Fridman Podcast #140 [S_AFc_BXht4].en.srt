curvy they're kind of complicated and so
 

871
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,510
curvy they're kind of complicated and so
the number of people who fit them is

872

the number of people who fit them is
 

873
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,230
the number of people who fit them is
maybe less than I like it mathematically

874

00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:28,320
weekend um I said okay you know if we're
 

929
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,430
weekend um I said okay you know if we're
going to give this a shot we we probably

930
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:31,440
going to give this a shot we we probably
 

931
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,070
going to give this a shot we we probably
we shouldn't see other people so it's a

932
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:34,080
we shouldn't see other people so it's a
 

933
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,909
we shouldn't see other people so it's a
risk you know it's commitment um but but

934
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:37,919
risk you know it's commitment um but but
 

935
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,310
risk you know it's commitment um but but
I just didn't see how it would work if

936
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,320
I just didn't see how it would work if
 

937
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,470
I just didn't see how it would work if
we were dating people locally and then

938
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:42,480
we were dating people locally and then
 

939
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,110
we were dating people locally and then
also seeing each other at a distance

940
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:44,120
also seeing each other at a distance
 

941
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,590
also seeing each other at a distance
because I you know I've had longdistance

942
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:45,600
because I you know I've had longdistance
 

943
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,909
because I you know I've had longdistance
relationships with war and they're hard

944
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:46,919
relationships with war and they're hard
 

945
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,909
relationships with war and they're hard
and they they take a lot of they take a

946
00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:48,919
and they they take a lot of they take a
 

947
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:51,110
and they they take a lot of they take a
lot of effort and so we decided we'd

948
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,120
lot of effort and so we decided we'd
 

949
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,590
lot of effort and so we decided we'd
give it three months and see what

950
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:52,600
give it three months and see what
 

951
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,470
give it three months and see what
happened and that was it this such an

952
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:55,480
happened and that was it this such an
 

953
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,590
happened and that was it this such an
interesting thing like we're all what is

954
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:58,600
interesting thing like we're all what is
 

955
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,470
interesting thing like we're all what is
it there are several billion of us and

956
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:00,480
it there are several billion of us and
 

957
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,430
it there are several billion of us and
we're kind of roaming this world and

958
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:02,440
we're kind of roaming this world and
 

959
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,110
we're kind of roaming this world and
then you kind of stick together you find

960
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:05,120
then you kind of stick together you find
 

961
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,830
then you kind of stick together you find
find somebody that just like gets you

962
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:07,840
find somebody that just like gets you
 

963
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,950
find somebody that just like gets you
and it's interesting to think about

964
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:09,960
and it's interesting to think about
 

965
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,590
and it's interesting to think about
there's probably thousands if not

966
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:11,600
there's probably thousands if not
 

967
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,190
there's probably thousands if not
millions of people that would would be

968
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:14,200
millions of people that would would be
 

969
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,270
millions of people that would would be

like I I haven't really known you very
 

1013
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,149
like I I haven't really known you very
long but I feel like I'm falling in love

1014
00:21:08,149 --> 00:21:08,159
long but I feel like I'm falling in love
 

1015
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,710
long but I feel like I'm falling in love
with you which can't possibly be

1016
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:09,720
with you which can't possibly be
 

1017
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,390
with you which can't possibly be
happening I must be projecting but it be

1018
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:12,400
happening I must be projecting but it be
 

1019
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,190
happening I must be projecting but it be
projecting but it certainly feels that

1020
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:14,200
projecting but it certainly feels that
 

1021
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,870
projecting but it certainly feels that
way right like I don't believe in love

1022
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:15,880
way right like I don't believe in love
 

1023
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,430
way right like I don't believe in love
at first sight so this can't really be

1024
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:18,440
at first sight so this can't really be
 

1025
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,830
at first sight so this can't really be
happening but it sort of feels like it

1026
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:19,840
happening but it sort of feels like it
 

1027
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,789
happening but it sort of feels like it
is and he was like I know what you mean

1028
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:21,799
is and he was like I know what you mean
 

1029
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:23,909
is and he was like I know what you mean
and so for the first three months or

1030
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:23,919
and so for the first three months or
 

1031
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,149
and so for the first three months or
four months we would say things to each

1032
00:21:25,149 --> 00:21:25,159
four months we would say things to each
 

1033
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,549
four months we would say things to each
other like I feel like I'm in love with

1034
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:27,559
other like I feel like I'm in love with
 

1035
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:29,549
other like I feel like I'm in love with
you

1036
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:29,559
you
 

1037
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:32,909
you
but you know but that can't but things

1038
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:32,919
but you know but that can't but things
 

1039
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:34,870
but you know but that can't but things
don't really work like that so but you

1040
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:34,880
don't really work like that so but you
 

1041
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,310
don't really work like that so but you
know so and then it became a joke like I

1042
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:37,320
know so and then it became a joke like I
 

1043
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,750
know so and then it became a joke like I
feel like I'm in love with you and then

1044
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:38,760
feel like I'm in love with you and then
 

1045
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,110
feel like I'm in love with you and then
eventually you know I think um but I

1046
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:42,120
eventually you know I think um but I
 

1047
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,430
eventually you know I think um but I
think that was one moment where we were

1048
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:44,440
think that was one moment where we were
 

1049
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,230
think that was one moment where we were
we were talking about I don't

1050
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:49,240
we were talking about I don't
 

1051
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,789
we were talking about I don't
just you know not just all the great

1052
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:52,799
just you know not just all the great
 

1053
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,590
just you know not just all the great
aspirations you have are all the things

1054
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:54,600
aspirations you have are all the things
 

1055
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,070
aspirations you have are all the things
but also things you don't like about

1056
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,080
but also things you don't like about
 

1057
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,510
but also things you don't like about
yourself things that you're worried

1058
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:57,520
yourself things that you're worried
 

1059
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,830
yourself things that you're worried
about things that you're scared of and

1060
00:21:59,830 --> 00:21:59,840
about things that you're scared of and
 

1061
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,390
about things that you're scared of and
then I think the that was sort of

1062
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:02,400
then I think the that was sort of
 

1063
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,630
then I think the that was sort of
solidified the relationship and then

1064
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:04,640
solidified the relationship and then
 

1065
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,909
solidified the relationship and then
there was one weekend where we went to

1066
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:06,919

1133
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,549
really clicking with that person
romantically but also just with friends

romantically but also just with friends
 

1135
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:41,630
romantically but also just with friends
it's possible to do that you recognize a

1136
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:41,640
it's possible to do that you recognize a
 

1137
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,669
it's possible to do that you recognize a
mind that's like yours or that's

mind that's like yours or that's
compatible with yours there are ways

1140
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:48,320
compatible with yours there are ways
 

1141
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,669
compatible with yours there are ways
that you feel like you're being

1142
00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:49,679
that you feel like you're being
 

1143
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,549
that you feel like you're being
understood or that you understand

1144
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:51,559
understood or that you understand
 

1145
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:53,110
understood or that you understand
something about this person or maybe you

1146
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:53,120
something about this person or maybe you
 

1147
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,710
something about this person or maybe you
see something in this person that you

1148
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:54,720
see something in this person that you
 

1149
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,430
see something in this person that you
find really compelling or intriguing but

1150
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:58,440
find really compelling or intriguing but
 

1151
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,350
find really compelling or intriguing but
I think you know your brain is

1152
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:01,360
I think you know your brain is
 

1153
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,110
I think you know your brain is
predictive organ right you're you you're

1154
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,120
predictive organ right you're you you're
 

1155
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,750
predictive organ right you're you you're
using your past you're projecting you're

1156
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:06,760
using your past you're projecting you're
 

1157
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,549
using your past you're projecting you're
using your past to yeah make predictions

1158
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:10,559
using your past to yeah make predictions
 

1159
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,310
using your past to yeah make predictions
and I mean not deliberately that's how

1160
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:13,320
and I mean not deliberately that's how
 

1161
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,470
and I mean not deliberately that's how
your brain is wired that's what it does

1162
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:15,480
your brain is wired that's what it does
 

1163
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,190
your brain is wired that's what it does
and so it's filling in all of the gaps

1164
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,200
and so it's filling in all of the gaps
 

1165
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,190
and so it's filling in all of the gaps
that you you know there are lots of gaps

1166
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:22,200
that you you know there are lots of gaps
 

1167
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,710
that you you know there are lots of gaps
of information that you don't you know

1168
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:24,720
of information that you don't you know
 

1169
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,710
of information that you don't you know
information you don't have and so your

1170
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:26,720
information you don't have and so your
 

1171
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,669
information you don't have and so your
brain is filling those in

1172
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:28,679
brain is filling those in
 

1173
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:30,269
brain is filling those in
and

1174
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:30,279
and
 

1175
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:33,310
and
um but isn't that what love is no I

1176
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:33,320
um but isn't that what love is no I
 

1177
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,830
um but isn't that what love is no I
don't think so actually I mean to some

1178
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:35,840
don't think so actually I mean to some
 

1179
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,269
don't think so actually I mean to some
extent sure you you always you know

1180
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:38,279
extent sure you you always you know
 

1181
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:40,789
extent sure you you always you know
there's research to show that people who

1182
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:40,799
there's research to show that people who
 

1183
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,190
there's research to show that people who
are in love always see the best in each

1184
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:43,200
are in love always see the best in each
 

1185
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,029
are in love always see the best in each
other and they you know when there's a

1186
00:24:46,029 --> 00:24:46,039
other and they you know when there's a
 

1187
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:48,110
other and they you know when there's a
when there's a negative interpretation

1188
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:48,120
when there's a negative interpretation
 

1189
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,590
when there's a negative interpretation
or positive interpretation you know they

1190
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:49,600
or positive interpretation you know they
 

1191
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,149
or positive interpretation you know they
choose the positive on there's a little

1192
00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:51,159
choose the positive on there's a little
 

1193
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:53,190
choose the positive on there's a little
bit of positive illusion there you know

1194
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:53,200
bit of positive illusion there you know
 

1195
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,430
bit of positive illusion there you know
going on that's what the research shows

1196
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:55,440
going on that's what the research shows
 

1197
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,149
going on that's what the research shows
but I think um

1198
00:24:59,149 --> 00:24:59,159
but I think um
 

1199
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:04,750
but I think um
I think that when you find somebody who

1200
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:04,760
I think that when you find somebody who
 

1201
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,830
I think that when you find somebody who
not just

1202
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:06,840
not just
 

1203
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,310
not just
appreciates your faults but Lo loves you

1204
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:11,320
appreciates your faults but Lo loves you
 

1205
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,149
appreciates your faults but Lo loves you
for them actually you know like maybe

1206
00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:14,159
for them actually you know like maybe
 

1207
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,510
for them actually you know like maybe
even doesn't see them as a fault

1208
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:17,520
even doesn't see them as a fault
 

1209
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,950
even doesn't see them as a fault
that's you so you have to be honest

1210
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:19,960
that's you so you have to be honest
 

1211
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,870
that's you so you have to be honest
enough about what

1212
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:21,880
enough about what
 

1213
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,549
enough about what
you're what your faults are so it's easy

1214
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:24,559
you're what your faults are so it's easy
 

1215
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,269
you're what your faults are so it's easy
to love someone for all the things that

1216
00:25:26,269 --> 00:25:26,279
to love someone for all the things that
 

1217
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:29,830
to love someone for all the things that
they um

1218
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:29,840

 

1219
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,590

uh for all the wonderful characteristics

1220
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:33,600
uh for all the wonderful characteristics
 

1221
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,710
uh for all the wonderful characteristics
they have it's harder I think to love

1222
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:36,720
they have it's harder I think to love
 

1223
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,430
they have it's harder I think to love
someone despite their faults or maybe

1224
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:38,440
someone despite their faults or maybe
 

1225
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,950
someone despite their faults or maybe
even the faults that they see aren't

1226
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:39,960
even the faults that they see aren't
 

1227
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,389
even the faults that they see aren't
really faults at all to you they're

1228
00:25:41,389 --> 00:25:41,399
really faults at all to you they're
 

1229
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:43,950
really faults at all to you they're
actually something really special but

1230
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:43,960
actually something really special but
 

1231
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,630
actually something really special but
isn't isn't that can't you explain that

1232
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:45,640
isn't isn't that can't you explain that
 

1233
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,909
isn't isn't that can't you explain that
by saying the brain kind of like you're

1234
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:47,919
by saying the brain kind of like you're
 

1235
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,310
by saying the brain kind of like you're
projecting it's you're you have a

1236
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:51,320
projecting it's you're you have a
 

1237
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:55,870
projecting it's you're you have a
conception of um a human being or just a

1238
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:55,880
conception of um a human being or just a
 

1239
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,950
conception of um a human being or just a
a spirit that really connects next with

1240
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:57,960
a spirit that really connects next with
 

1241
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,350
a spirit that really connects next with
you and you're projecting that onto that

1242
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:00,360
you and you're projecting that onto that
 

1243
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,909
you and you're projecting that onto that
person and within within that framework

1244
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:03,919
person and within within that framework
 

1245
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,830
person and within within that framework
all their faults then become beautiful

1246
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:05,840
all their faults then become beautiful
 

1247
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,310
all their faults then become beautiful
like little maybe but you you just have

1248
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:08,320
like little maybe but you you just have
 

1249
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,510
like little maybe but you you just have
to pay attention to the prediction

1250
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:10,520
to pay attention to the prediction
 

1251
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,470
to pay attention to the prediction
error no but maybe that's what love like

1252
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:14,480
error no but maybe that's what love like
 

1253
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,389
error no but maybe that's what love like
maybe you IGN you start ignoring the

1254
00:26:16,389 --> 00:26:16,399
maybe you IGN you start ignoring the
 

1255
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:18,430
maybe you IGN you start ignoring the
prediction error that's maybe love is

1256
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:18,440
prediction error that's maybe love is
 

1257
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,470
prediction error that's maybe love is
just your

1258
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:19,480
just your
 

1259
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,149
just your
ability uh like to ignore the prediction

1260
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:22,159
ability uh like to ignore the prediction
 

1261
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,350
ability uh like to ignore the prediction
era well I think that there's some

1262
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:24,360
era well I think that there's some
 

1263
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,350
era well I think that there's some
research that might say that but that's

1264
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:26,360
research that might say that but that's
 

1265
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,510
research that might say that but that's
not my experience I guess um but there

1266
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:30,520
not my experience I guess um but there
 

1267
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,070
not my experience I guess um but there
is some research that says I mean

1268
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,080
is some research that says I mean
 

1269
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,269
is some research that says I mean
there's some some research that says you

1270
00:26:33,269 --> 00:26:33,279
there's some some research that says you
 

1271
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,789
there's some some research that says you
have to have an optimal margin of

1272
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:34,799
have to have an optimal margin of
 

1273
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,350
have to have an optimal margin of
Illusion which means that you um that

1274
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:38,360
Illusion which means that you um that
 

1275
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,870
Illusion which means that you um that
you put a positive spin on on smaller

1276
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:41,880
you put a positive spin on on smaller
 

1277
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,990
you put a positive spin on on smaller
things but you don't ignore the bigger

1278
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,000
things but you don't ignore the bigger
 

1279
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,830
things but you don't ignore the bigger
things right and I think without being

1280
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:46,840
things right and I think without being
 

1281
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,549
things right and I think without being
judgmental at all when someone says to

1282
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:49,559
judgmental at all when someone says to
 

1283
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:52,190
judgmental at all when someone says to
me you know um you're not who I thought

1284
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:52,200
me you know um you're not who I thought
 

1285
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,750
me you know um you're not who I thought
you were I mean nobody says has said

1286
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:53,760
you were I mean nobody says has said
 

1287
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,190
you were I mean nobody says has said
that to me in a really long time but

1288
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:55,200
that to me in a really long time but
 

1289
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,870
that to me in a really long time but
certainly when I was younger that was

1290
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:56,880
certainly when I was younger that was
 

1291
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,909
certainly when I was younger that was
you know you're not who I thought you

1292
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:57,919
you know you're not who I thought you
 

1293
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,269
you know you're not who I thought you
were my reaction to that was well whose

1294
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:00,279
were my reaction to that was well whose
 

1295
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:01,470
were my reaction to that was well whose
fault is

1296
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:01,480
fault is
 

1297
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,590
fault is
that you know yeah um I'm a pretty I'm a

1298
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:05,600
that you know yeah um I'm a pretty I'm a
 

1299
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,750
that you know yeah um I'm a pretty I'm a
pretty upfront person um I mean I will

1300
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:08,760
pretty upfront person um I mean I will
 

1301
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,830
pretty upfront person um I mean I will
though say that in my

1302
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:10,840
though say that in my
 

1303
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,190
though say that in my
experience people people don't lie to

1304
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:14,200
experience people people don't lie to
 

1305
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,590
experience people people don't lie to
you about who they are they lie to

1306
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:16,600
you about who they are they lie to
 

1307
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,990
you about who they are they lie to
themselves in your

1308
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:20,000

 

1309
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,149

presence yeah um and so you

1310
00:27:24,149 --> 00:27:24,159
presence yeah um and so you
 

1311
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,669
presence yeah um and so you
know you don't want to get T tied up in

1312
00:27:28,669 --> 00:27:28,679
know you don't want to get T tied up in
 

1313
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:31,190
know you don't want to get T tied up in
that tangled up in that and I think from

1314
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:31,200
that tangled up in that and I think from
 

1315
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,630
that tangled up in that and I think from
the ge-o Dan and I were just for

1316
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:33,640
the ge-o Dan and I were just for
 

1317
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,990
the ge-o Dan and I were just for
whatever reason maybe it's because we

1318
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:35,000
whatever reason maybe it's because we
 

1319
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,190
whatever reason maybe it's because we
both have been divorced already and you

1320

both have been divorced already and you
 

1321
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,990
both have been divorced already and you
know

00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:40,000
know
 

1323
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,590
know
um you know he told me who he thought he

was and he he was pretty accurate as far
 

1327
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,070
was and he he was pretty accurate as far
as I pretty much actually I mean I

1328
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,080
as I pretty much actually I mean I
 

1329
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,430
as I pretty much actually I mean I
there's

1330
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:50,440
there's
 

1331
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,669
there's
very I can't say that I've ever come

1332

across a characteristic in him that
 

1335
00:27:55,399 --> 00:27:58,350
across a characteristic in him that
really surprised me in a bad way

1336
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:58,360
really surprised me in a bad way
 

1337
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,990
really surprised me in a bad way
it's hard to know yourself it it is hard

1338
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:01,000
it's hard to know yourself it it is hard
 

1339
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,750
it's hard to know yourself it it is hard
to know yourself to communicate that for

1340
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:02,760
to know yourself to communicate that for
 

1341
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,190
to know yourself to communicate that for
sure I mean I'll say you know I had the

1342
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:06,200
sure I mean I'll say you know I had the
 

1343
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,389
sure I mean I'll say you know I had the
advantage of training as a therapist

1344
00:28:08,389 --> 00:28:08,399
advantage of training as a therapist
 

1345
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,430
advantage of training as a therapist
which meant for five years I was under a

1346
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:10,440
which meant for five years I was under a
 

1347
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,870
which meant for five years I was under a
 microscope yeah um you know when

1348
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:12,880
microscope yeah um you know when
 

1349
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,149
microscope yeah um you know when
I was training as a therapist it was

1350
00:28:15,149 --> 00:28:15,159
I was training as a therapist it was
 

1351

I was training as a therapist it was
hour for hour supervision which meant if

1352
00:28:17,549 --> 00:28:17,559
hour for hour supervision which meant if
 

1353
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:19,669
hour for hour supervision which meant if
you were in a room with a client for an

supervisor so that Supervisor was behind
the mirror why for your session and then

1360
00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:28,519
the mirror why for your session and then
 

1361
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:30,590
the mirror why for your session and then
you went and had an hour of discussion

you went and had an hour of discussion
 

1363
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,029
you went and had an hour of discussion
about what you said what you didn't say

consciously are still able to lose
 

1391
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:11,950
consciously are still able to lose
yourself in the moment I'm definitely

1392
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:11,960
yourself in the moment I'm definitely
 

1393
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,710
yourself in the moment I'm definitely
able to lose myself in the moment is

1394
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:13,720
able to lose myself in the moment is
 

1395
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,509
able to lose myself in the moment is
wine

1396
00:29:14,509 --> 00:29:14,519
wine
 

1397
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:17,590
wine
involved not always chocolate I mean

1398
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:17,600
involved not always chocolate I mean
 

1399
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,990
involved not always chocolate I mean
some kind of mind altering substance

1400
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,000
some kind of mind altering substance
 

1401
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,509
some kind of mind altering substance
right but um yeah for sure I mean I

1402
00:29:23,509 --> 00:29:23,519
right but um yeah for sure I mean I
 

1403
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:25,250
right but um yeah for sure I mean I
guess what I would say though is that

1404
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:25,260
guess what I would say though is that
 

1405
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,310
guess what I would say though is that
[Music]

1406
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:26,320
[Music]
 

1407
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,190
[Music]
um for me part of the magic is the

1408
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:30,200
um for me part of the magic is the
 

1409
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,789
um for me part of the magic is the
process like so ah you know so so I

1410
00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:33,799
process like so ah you know so so I
 

1411
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:35,549
process like so ah you know so so I
remember a day there was well I was

1412
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:35,559
remember a day there was well I was
 

1413
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:37,710
remember a day there was well I was
working on this on this on this book of

1414
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:37,720
working on this on this on this book of
 

1415
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,509
working on this on this on this book of
essays I I was in New York um I can't

1416
00:29:41,509 --> 00:29:41,519
essays I I was in New York um I can't
 

1417
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:43,029
essays I I was in New York um I can't
remember why I was in New York but I was

1418
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:43,039
remember why I was in New York but I was
 

1419
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,870
remember why I was in New York but I was
in New York for something and I was in

1420
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:45,880
in New York for something and I was in
 

1421
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,230
in New York for something and I was in
Central Park and I was looking at all

1422
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:48,240
Central Park and I was looking at all
 

1423
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,590
Central Park and I was looking at all
the people with their babies and I was

1424
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:51,600
the people with their babies and I was
 

1425
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,549
the people with their babies and I was
thinking every every that each one of

1426
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:54,559
thinking every every that each one of
 

1427
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,350
thinking every every that each one of
these there's a tiny little brain yeah

1428
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:57,360
these there's a tiny little brain yeah
 

1429
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,029
these there's a tiny little brain yeah
that's wiring itself right now and I and

1430
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:01,039
that's wiring itself right now and I and
 

1431
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,669
that's wiring itself right now and I and
I I just I felt in that moment I was

1432
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:03,679
I I just I felt in that moment I was
 

1433
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,269
I I just I felt in that moment I was
like I am never going to look at an

1434
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:05,279
like I am never going to look at an
 

1435
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,269
like I am never going to look at an
infant in the same way ever again and so

1436
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:09,279
infant in the same way ever again and so
 

1437
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,310
infant in the same way ever again and so
to me I mean honestly before I started

1438
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:12,320
to me I mean honestly before I started
 

1439
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,509
to me I mean honestly before I started
learning about brain development I

1440
00:30:14,509 --> 00:30:14,519
learning about brain development I
 

1441
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:16,750
learning about brain development I
thought babies were cute but you know

1442
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:16,760
thought babies were cute but you know
 

1443
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,950
thought babies were cute but you know
not that interesting until they could do

1444
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:18,960
not that interesting until they could do
 

1445
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,470
not that interesting until they could do
interact with you and do things of

1446
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:21,480
interact with you and do things of
 

1447
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,950
interact with you and do things of
course my own infant I thought was

1448
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:22,960
course my own infant I thought was
 

1449
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,470
course my own infant I thought was
extraordinarily interesting but you know

1450
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:25,480
extraordinarily interesting but you know
 

1451
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,669
extraordinarily interesting but you know
they're kind of like lumps that you know

1452
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:27,679
they're kind of like lumps that you know
 

1453
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,310
they're kind of like lumps that you know
until they can you know interact with

1454
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:29,320
until they can you know interact with
 

1455
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,669
until they can you know interact with
you but they are anything but lumps I

1456
00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:31,679
you but they are anything but lumps I
 

1457
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,870
you but they are anything but lumps I
mean like you know so and part of the I

1458
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:35,880
mean like you know so and part of the I
 

1459
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,190
mean like you know so and part of the I
mean I all I can say is I have deep

1460
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:38,200
mean I all I can say is I have deep
 

1461
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,669
mean I all I can say is I have deep
affection now for like tiny little

1462
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:40,679
affection now for like tiny little
 

1463
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:44,950
affection now for like tiny little
babies in a way that I didn't really um

1464
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:44,960
babies in a way that I didn't really um
 

1465
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:50,630
babies in a way that I didn't really um
before um ju because of the I'm just so

1466
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:50,640
before um ju because of the I'm just so
 

1467
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,830
before um ju because of the I'm just so
curious but the actual process the

1468
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:52,840
curious but the actual process the
 

1469
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,430
curious but the actual process the
mechanisms of uh the the the wiring of

1470
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:55,440
mechanisms of uh the the the wiring of
 

1471
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,110
mechanisms of uh the the the wiring of
the brain the learning all the magic of

1472
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:57,120
the brain the learning all the magic of
 

1473
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,870
the brain the learning all the magic of
the the neurobiology yeah and or you

1474
00:30:59,870 --> 00:30:59,880
the the neurobiology yeah and or you
 

1475
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,230
the the neurobiology yeah and or you
know something like you know um when you

1476
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:03,240
know something like you know um when you
 

1477
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,269
know something like you know um when you
make eye contact with someone

1478
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:05,279
make eye contact with someone
 

1479
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,830
make eye contact with someone
directly sometimes you know you you feel

1480
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:09,840
directly sometimes you know you you feel
 

1481
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,870
directly sometimes you know you you feel
something right yeah and um yeah that's

1482
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:12,880
something right yeah and um yeah that's
 

1483
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,269
something right yeah and um yeah that's
weird what is it and what is that and so

1484
00:31:16,269 --> 00:31:16,279
weird what is it and what is that and so
 

1485
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:18,789
weird what is it and what is that and so
so to me that's not um that's not

1486
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:18,799
so to me that's not um that's not
 

1487
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,830
so to me that's not um that's not
backing away from the moment that's like

1488
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:20,840
backing away from the moment that's like
 

1489
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,310
backing away from the moment that's like
expanding the moment it's like that's

1490
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:23,320
expanding the moment it's like that's
 

1491
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,509
expanding the moment it's like that's
incredibly cool you know when I was um

1492
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:26,519
incredibly cool you know when I was um
 

1493
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:28,870
incredibly cool you know when I was um
I'll just say that when I was when I was

1494
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:28,880
I'll just say that when I was when I was
 

1495
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,509
I'll just say that when I was when I was
in graduate school I

1496
00:31:31,509 --> 00:31:31,519
in graduate school I
 

1497
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,190
in graduate school I
also was in therapy because it's almost

1498
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:34,200
also was in therapy because it's almost
 

1499
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,710
also was in therapy because it's almost
a given that you're going to be in

1500
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:35,720
a given that you're going to be in
 

1501
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,509
a given that you're going to be in
therapy yourself if you're going to

1502
00:31:37,509 --> 00:31:37,519
therapy yourself if you're going to
 

1503
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,789
therapy yourself if you're going to
become a therapist and I had a deal you

1504
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:40,799
become a therapist and I had a deal you
 

1505
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,750
become a therapist and I had a deal you
know with my therapist which was that I

1506
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:42,760
know with my therapist which was that I
 

1507
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,110
know with my therapist which was that I
could call time out at any moment that I

1508
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:45,120
could call time out at any moment that I
 

1509
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,870
could call time out at any moment that I
wanted to As Long As I was being

1510
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:46,880
wanted to As Long As I was being
 

1511
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,870
wanted to As Long As I was being
responsible about it and I wasn't using

1512
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:48,880
responsible about it and I wasn't using
 

1513
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,190
responsible about it and I wasn't using
it as a way to get out of something and

1514
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:51,200
it as a way to get out of something and
 

1515
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,430
it as a way to get out of something and
he could tell me no you know he could

1516
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:53,440
he could tell me no you know he could
 

1517
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,509
he could tell me no you know he could
Decline and say no we're you're you know

1518
00:31:55,509 --> 00:31:55,519
Decline and say no we're you're you know
 

1519
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:56,629
Decline and say no we're you're you know
you're using this to get out of

1520
00:31:56,629 --> 00:31:56,639
you're using this to get out of
 

1521
00:31:56,639 --> 00:31:58,230
you're using this to get out of
something but I could call time out

1522
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:58,240
something but I could call time out
 

1523
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,750
something but I could call time out
whenever I want and say what are you

1524
00:31:59,750 --> 00:31:59,760
whenever I want and say what are you
 

1525
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,389
whenever I want and say what are you
doing right now like what are you here's

1526
00:32:01,389 --> 00:32:01,399
doing right now like what are you here's
 

1527
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:02,629
doing right now like what are you here's
what I'm experiencing what are you

1528
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:02,639
what I'm experiencing what are you
 

1529
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:05,629
what I'm experiencing what are you
trying to do like I wanted to use my own

1530
00:32:05,629 --> 00:32:05,639
trying to do like I wanted to use my own
 

1531
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:07,269
trying to do like I wanted to use my own
experience to

1532
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:07,279
experience to
 

1533
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:12,269
experience to
interrogate um what the process was and

1534
00:32:12,269 --> 00:32:12,279
interrogate um what the process was and
 

1535
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:15,230
interrogate um what the process was and
that made

1536
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:15,240

 

1537
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,149

it more helpful in a way do you know

1538
00:32:18,149 --> 00:32:18,159
it more helpful in a way do you know
 

1539
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,350
it more helpful in a way do you know
what I mean so yeah I don't I don't

1540
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:20,360
what I mean so yeah I don't I don't
 

1541
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,750
what I mean so yeah I don't I don't
think learning how something works makes

1542
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:21,760
think learning how something works makes
 

1543
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,310
think learning how something works makes
it less magical actually but that's just

adulting uh with love uh than uh then
perhaps I am because there is a magic to

1604
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:39,480
perhaps I am because there is a magic to
 

1605
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,509
perhaps I am because there is a magic to
children I also

1606
00:33:42,509 --> 00:33:42,519
children I also
 

1607

think like of adults as children it's
kind of cool to see it's a cool thought

1610
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:48,120
kind of cool to see it's a cool thought
 

1611
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,750
kind of cool to see it's a cool thought
experiment to look at adults and think

1612
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:50,760
experiment to look at adults and think
 

1613
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,750
experiment to look at adults and think
like that used to be a baby and then

1614
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:53,760
like that used to be a baby and then
 

1615
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,470
like that used to be a baby and then
that's like a fully wired baby and it's

1616
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:56,480
that's like a fully wired baby and it's
 

1617
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,230
that's like a fully wired baby and it's
just walking around pretending to be

1618
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:58,240
just walking around pretending to be
 

1619
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,269
just walking around pretending to be
like all serious and important wearing a

1620
00:34:00,269 --> 00:34:00,279
like all serious and important wearing a
 

1621
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:02,590
like all serious and important wearing a
suit or something but that used to be a

1622
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:02,600
suit or something but that used to be a
 

1623
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,750
suit or something but that used to be a
baby and then you think of like the

1624
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:04,760
baby and then you think of like the
 

1625
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,629
baby and then you think of like the
parenting and all the experiences they

1626
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:06,639
parenting and all the experiences they
 

1627
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:09,149
parenting and all the experiences they
had like it's it's cool to think of it

1628
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:09,159
had like it's it's cool to think of it
 

1629
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:11,230
had like it's it's cool to think of it
that way but then you I started thinking

1630
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:11,240
that way but then you I started thinking
 

1631
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,470
that way but then you I started thinking
like from a machine learning perspective

1632
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:13,480
like from a machine learning perspective
 

1633
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,710
like from a machine learning perspective
but once you're like the romantic

1634
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:15,720
but once you're like the romantic
 

1635
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,750
but once you're like the romantic
moments all that kind of stuff all that

1636
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:17,760
moments all that kind of stuff all that
 

1637
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,629
moments all that kind of stuff all that
falls away I forget about all that I

1638
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:20,639
falls away I forget about all that I
 

1639
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,470
falls away I forget about all that I
don't know that's the Russian thing

1640
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:23,480
don't know that's the Russian thing
 

1641
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,669
don't know that's the Russian thing
maybe maybe but I also think it might be

1642
00:34:25,669 --> 00:34:25,679
maybe maybe but I also think it might be
 

1643
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,069
maybe maybe but I also think it might be
an age thing or maybe an experienc thing

1644
00:34:28,069 --> 00:34:28,079
an age thing or maybe an experienc thing
 

1645
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,069
an age thing or maybe an experienc thing
so I

1646
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:29,079
so I
 

1647
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:33,629
so I
think um we all I mean if you're exposed

1648
00:34:33,629 --> 00:34:33,639
think um we all I mean if you're exposed
 

1649
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:36,190
think um we all I mean if you're exposed
to Western culture at all you are

1650
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:36,200
to Western culture at all you are
 

1651
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:40,030
to Western culture at all you are
exposed to the uh sort of idealized

1652
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:40,040
exposed to the uh sort of idealized
 

1653
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:44,310
exposed to the uh sort of idealized
stereotypic romantic romantic you know

1654
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:44,320

1655
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,470
stereotypic romantic romantic you know
uh exchange and what what does it mean

1656
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:46,480

1657
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:52,270

1661
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,790
um um I'm see how to phrase it okay so
not really test but this this tells you

1662
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:57,800
not really test but this this tells you
 

1663
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,470
not really test but this this tells you
something about your own ideas about

1664
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:02,480

 

1665

I don't really argue about much except
 

2205
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,309
I don't really argue about much except
um directions in the car like we're

2206
00:46:42,309 --> 00:46:42,319
um directions in the car like we're
 

2207
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:43,549
um directions in the car like we're
that's where're that's if we're going to

2208
00:46:43,549 --> 00:46:43,559
that's where're that's if we're going to
 

2209
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:44,870
that's where're that's if we're going to
have an argument that's going to be

2210
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:44,880
have an argument that's going to be
 

2211
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,349
have an argument that's going to be
where it's going to happen where what's

2212
00:46:46,349 --> 00:46:46,359
where it's going to happen where what's
 

2213
00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:48,549
where it's going to happen where what's
the what's the nature of the argument

2214
00:46:48,549 --> 00:46:48,559
the what's the nature of the argument
 

2215
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:50,430
the what's the nature of the argument
about directions exactly I don't really

2216
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:50,440
about directions exactly I don't really
 

2217
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,750
about directions exactly I don't really
know it's just that we're very I think

2218
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:52,760
know it's just that we're very I think
 

2219
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,589
know it's just that we're very I think
it's that spatially you know he he um

2220
00:46:56,589 --> 00:46:56,599
it's that spatially you know he he um
 

2221
00:46:56,599 --> 00:46:59,390
it's that spatially you know he he um
I use egocentric space so I want to say

2222
00:46:59,390 --> 00:46:59,400
I use egocentric space so I want to say
 

2223
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,750
I use egocentric space so I want to say
you know turn left like I always I'm I'm

2224
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:02,760
you know turn left like I always I'm I'm
 

2225
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,589
you know turn left like I always I'm I'm
reasoning in relation to like my own

2226
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:04,599
reasoning in relation to like my own
 

2227
00:47:04,599 --> 00:47:07,190
reasoning in relation to like my own
physical corporeal body so you know you

2228
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:07,200
physical corporeal body so you know you
 

2229
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,390
physical corporeal body so you know you
walk to the church and you turn left and

2230
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:09,400
walk to the church and you turn left and
 

2231
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,150

I'm always like and his you know he
 

2235
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,270
I'm always like and his you know he
gives directions um aloc centrically

2236
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:16,280
gives directions um aloc centrically
 

2237
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,390
gives directions um aloc centrically
which means um organized around north

2238
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:19,400
which means um organized around north
 

2239
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,230
which means um organized around north
south east west right so to you the the

2240
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:22,240
south east west right so to you the the
 

2241
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,829
south east west right so to you the the
Earth is at the center of the solar

Earth is at the center of the solar
 

2243
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:26,790
Earth is at the center of the solar
system and to him no I'm reason I'm at

2244
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:26,800
system and to him no I'm reason I'm at
 

2245
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,109
system and to him no I'm reason I'm at
theer you're at the center of the Sol

2246

2247
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:32,510
theer you're at the center of the Sol
system okay so uh anyway so we we but

2248
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:32,520
system okay so uh anyway so we we but
 

2249
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,670
system okay so uh anyway so we we but
but here we you know we we had some

but here we you know we we had some
 

2251
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,390
but here we you know we we had some
really RI roaring arguments like really

2252
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:38,400
really RI roaring arguments like really
 

2253
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,309
really RI roaring arguments like really
rip roaring arguments where he would say

2254
00:47:40,309 --> 00:47:40,319
rip roaring arguments where he would say
 

2255
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,349
rip roaring arguments where he would say
like who is this for is this for the

versus academics you know are these for
the scientists or for the CI is this for

one terrible argument that we had where
 

2275
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,190
one terrible argument that we had where

2281
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:14,589
each other all the time um he made these
little signs writing and Science and we

2282
00:48:14,589 --> 00:48:14,599
little signs writing and Science and we
 

2283
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:18,430
little signs writing and Science and we
only us them this this was like when you

2284
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:18,440
only us them this this was like when you
 

2285
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,510
only us them this this was like when you
when you pulled out a sign that's it

2286
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:20,520
when you pulled out a sign that's it
 

2287
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,349

um and we didn't really have to use it
 

2295
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,910
um and we didn't really have to use it
too much for this book cuz this book was

2296

too much for this book cuz this book was
 

2297
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,030
too much for this book cuz this book was
in some ways

2298

2309
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,589
um how tions are made really St stood me
in good stead for for this book so there

2310
00:48:50,589 --> 00:48:50,599
in good stead for for this book so there
 

2311
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:52,430
in good stead for for this book so there
was a little bit each essay was a little

2312
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:52,440
was a little bit each essay was a little
 

2313
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,309
was a little bit each essay was a little
bit of learning a couple were was a

2314
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:54,319
bit of learning a couple were was a
 

2315
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:57,309
bit of learning a couple were was a
little more than than a small amount but

2316
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:57,319
little more than than a small amount but
 

2317
00:48:57,319 --> 00:48:59,309
little more than than a small amount but
um but I I didn't have so much trouble

2318
00:48:59,309 --> 00:48:59,319
um but I I didn't have so much trouble
 

2319
00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:01,950
um but I I didn't have so much trouble
here um I had a lot of trouble with the

2320
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:01,960
here um I had a lot of trouble with the
 

2321
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:05,109
here um I had a lot of trouble with the
first book um but still even here you

2322
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:05,119
first book um but still even here you
 

2323
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,549
first book um but still even here you
know um you know he would tell me that I

2324
00:49:08,549 --> 00:49:08,559
know um you know he would tell me that I
 

2325
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:09,950
know um you know he would tell me that I
could take something out and I really

2326
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:09,960
could take something out and I really
 

2327
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,430
could take something out and I really
wanted to keep it and um I think we only

2328
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:13,440
wanted to keep it and um I think we only
 

2329
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,510
wanted to keep it and um I think we only
use the signs once well if we could dive

2330
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:16,520
use the signs once well if we could dive
 

2331
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,309
use the signs once well if we could dive
in some aspects of the book I I would

2332
00:49:18,309 --> 00:49:18,319
in some aspects of the book I I would
 

2333
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:22,109
in some aspects of the book I I would
love that um can we talk about so one of

2334
00:49:22,109 --> 00:49:22,119
love that um can we talk about so one of
 

2335
00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:24,510
love that um can we talk about so one of
the essays looks at

2336
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:24,520
the essays looks at
 

2337
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:28,549
the essays looks at
evolution

2338
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:28,559

 

2339
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:31,309

let me ask the big question uh did the

2340
00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:31,319
let me ask the big question uh did the
 

2341
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:35,069
let me ask the big question uh did the
human brain evolve to think that's

2342
00:49:35,069 --> 00:49:35,079
human brain evolve to think that's
 

2343
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:36,950
human brain evolve to think that's
essentially the question that you

2344
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:36,960
essentially the question that you
 

2345
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,430
essentially the question that you
address in the essay can you speak to it

2346
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:39,440
address in the essay can you speak to it
 

2347
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,190
address in the essay can you speak to it
sure you know the the big cave out here

2348
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:42,200
sure you know the the big cave out here
 

2349
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,750
sure you know the the big cave out here
is that we don't really know why brains

2350
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:44,760
is that we don't really know why brains
 

2351
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,789
is that we don't really know why brains
evolved the the big why questions are

2352
00:49:47,789 --> 00:49:47,799
evolved the the big why questions are
 

2353
00:49:47,799 --> 00:49:53,230
evolved the the big why questions are
called

2354
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:53,240

 

2355
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,309

teologico those questions because we

2356
00:49:55,309 --> 00:49:55,319
teologico those questions because we
 

2357
00:49:55,319 --> 00:49:56,990
teologico those questions because we
don't don't know really why we don't

2358
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:57,000
don't don't know really why we don't
 

2359
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,589
don't don't know really why we don't
know the why

2360
00:49:59,589 --> 00:49:59,599
know the why
 

2361
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:04,030
know the why
however for for a very long time the

2362
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:04,040
however for for a very long time the
 

2363
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,069
however for for a very long time the
Assumption was that Evolution worked in

2364
00:50:07,069 --> 00:50:07,079
Assumption was that Evolution worked in
 

2365
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:09,589
Assumption was that Evolution worked in
a progressive upward scale that you

2366
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:09,599
a progressive upward scale that you
 

2367
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:11,589
a progressive upward scale that you
start off with simple organisms and

2368
00:50:11,589 --> 00:50:11,599
start off with simple organisms and
 

2369
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:13,109
start off with simple organisms and
those organisms get more complex and

2370
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:13,119
those organisms get more complex and
 

2371
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,030
those organisms get more complex and
more complex and more complex now

2372
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:15,040
more complex and more complex now
 

2373
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,470
more complex and more complex now
obviously that's true in some like

2374
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:17,480
obviously that's true in some like
 

2375
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,470
obviously that's true in some like
really General way right that that um

2376
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:20,480
really General way right that that um
 

2377
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,910
really General way right that that um
life started off as single cell

2378
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:21,920
life started off as single cell
 

2379
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,950
life started off as single cell
organisms and you know things got more

2380
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:23,960
organisms and you know things got more
 

2381
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:28,950
organisms and you know things got more
complex but the idea that um that brains

2382
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:28,960
complex but the idea that um that brains
 

2383
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,270
complex but the idea that um that brains
evolved in some upward um trajectory

2384
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:32,280
evolved in some upward um trajectory
 

2385
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,789
evolved in some upward um trajectory
from simple brains in simple animals to

2386
00:50:34,789 --> 00:50:34,799
from simple brains in simple animals to
 

2387
00:50:34,799 --> 00:50:37,270
from simple brains in simple animals to
complex brains in complex animals is

2388
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:37,280
complex brains in complex animals is
 

2389
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,870
complex brains in complex animals is
called a philogenetic scale um and um

2390
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:41,880
called a philogenetic scale um and um
 

2391
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,510
called a philogenetic scale um and um
that philogenetic scale is embedded in a

2392
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:44,520
that philogenetic scale is embedded in a
 

2393
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,390
that philogenetic scale is embedded in a
lot of evolutionary thinking including

2394
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:46,400
lot of evolutionary thinking including
 

2395
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,829
lot of evolutionary thinking including
darwins actually um and it's been

2396
00:50:50,829 --> 00:50:50,839
darwins actually um and it's been
 

2397
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:53,470
darwins actually um and it's been
seriously challenged I would say by

2398
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:53,480
seriously challenged I would say by
 

2399
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:57,670
seriously challenged I would say by
modern uh evolutionary bi biology um and

2400
00:50:57,670 --> 00:50:57,680
modern uh evolutionary bi biology um and
 

2401
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:01,510
modern uh evolutionary bi biology um and
so you know thinking is something that

2402
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:01,520
so you know thinking is something that
 

2403
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,390
so you know thinking is something that
rationality is something that humans at

2404
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:04,400
rationality is something that humans at
 

2405
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,109
rationality is something that humans at
least in the west really prize um as a

2406
00:51:08,109 --> 00:51:08,119
least in the west really prize um as a
 

2407
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:11,670
least in the west really prize um as a
great uh human achievement and so the

2408
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:11,680
great uh human achievement and so the
 

2409
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:15,309
great uh human achievement and so the
idea that the most common evolutionary

2410
00:51:15,309 --> 00:51:15,319
idea that the most common evolutionary
 

2411
00:51:15,319 --> 00:51:18,510
idea that the most common evolutionary
story is that you know brains evolved in

2412
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:18,520
story is that you know brains evolved in
 

2413
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,950
story is that you know brains evolved in
um like sedimentary rock um uh with you

2414
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:21,960
um like sedimentary rock um uh with you
 

2415
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,109
um like sedimentary rock um uh with you
know a layer for instincts that's your

2416
00:51:24,109 --> 00:51:24,119
know a layer for instincts that's your
 

2417
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:28,150
know a layer for instincts that's your
lizard brain and a layer on top of that

2418
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:28,160
lizard brain and a layer on top of that
 

2419
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,390
lizard brain and a layer on top of that
uh uh for emotions that's your limic

2420
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:31,400
uh uh for emotions that's your limic
 

2421
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,109
uh uh for emotions that's your limic
system lyic meaning border so it borders

2422
00:51:34,109 --> 00:51:34,119
system lyic meaning border so it borders
 

2423
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:36,630
system lyic meaning border so it borders
the parts that are for instincts oh

2424
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:36,640
the parts that are for instincts oh
 

2425
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,910
the parts that are for instincts oh
interesting and um and then um the uh

2426
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:40,920
interesting and um and then um the uh
 

2427
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,670
interesting and um and then um the uh
neocortex or new cortex where um

2428
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:44,680
neocortex or new cortex where um
 

2429
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,349
neocortex or new cortex where um
rationality is supposed to live that's

2430
00:51:46,349 --> 00:51:46,359
rationality is supposed to live that's
 

2431
00:51:46,359 --> 00:51:48,670
rationality is supposed to live that's
the sort of traditional story it just

2432
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:48,680
the sort of traditional story it just
 

2433
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,349
the sort of traditional story it just
keeps getting layered on top by

2434
00:51:51,349 --> 00:51:51,359
keeps getting layered on top by
 

2435
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:53,109
keeps getting layered on top by
Evolution right and so you can think

2436
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:53,119
Evolution right and so you can think
 

2437
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,670
Evolution right and so you can think
about you know I mean sedimentary rock

2438
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:56,680
about you know I mean sedimentary rock
 

2439
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,470
about you know I mean sedimentary rock
is the way typically people describe it

2440
00:51:58,470 --> 00:51:58,480
is the way typically people describe it
 

2441
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,270
is the way typically people describe it
the way I sometimes like to think about

2442
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:00,280
the way I sometimes like to think about
 

2443
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,309
the way I sometimes like to think about
it is um you know thinking about the

2444
00:52:02,309 --> 00:52:02,319
it is um you know thinking about the
 

2445
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:05,349
it is um you know thinking about the
cerebral cortex like uh icing on an

2446
00:52:05,349 --> 00:52:05,359
cerebral cortex like uh icing on an
 

2447
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:09,150
cerebral cortex like uh icing on an
already baked cake you know um where you

2448
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:09,160
already baked cake you know um where you
 

2449
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,349
already baked cake you know um where you
know the cake is your inner Beast these

2450
00:52:11,349 --> 00:52:11,359
know the cake is your inner Beast these
 

2451
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:13,829
know the cake is your inner Beast these
like boiling you know roiling instincts

2452
00:52:13,829 --> 00:52:13,839
like boiling you know roiling instincts
 

2453
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,270
like boiling you know roiling instincts
and emotions that have to be contained

2454
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:16,280
and emotions that have to be contained
 

2455
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:20,670
and emotions that have to be contained
and the the by the cortex and the the

2456
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:20,680
and the the by the cortex and the the
 

2457
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,870

it's just um it's a fiction it's a myth

2458
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:23,880
it's just um it's a fiction it's a myth
 

2459
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,549
it's just um it's a fiction it's a myth
it it's a myth that you can trace all

2460
00:52:25,549 --> 00:52:25,559
it it's a myth that you can trace all
 

2461
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,990
it it's a myth that you can trace all
the way back to stories about morality

2462
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:29,000
the way back to stories about morality
 

2463
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,950
the way back to stories about morality
um in ancient Greece but what you can do

2464
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:32,960
um in ancient Greece but what you can do
 

2465
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,950
um in ancient Greece but what you can do
is look at the scientific record and say

2466
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:35,960
is look at the scientific record and say
 

2467
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,390
is look at the scientific record and say
well there there's others there are

2468
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:37,400
well there there's others there are
 

2469
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,190
well there there's others there are
other stories that you could tell about

2470
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:39,200
other stories that you could tell about
 

2471
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:43,630
other stories that you could tell about
brain Evolution and and the the context

2472
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:43,640
brain Evolution and and the the context
 

2473
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:47,670
brain Evolution and and the the context
in which brains evolved so when you look

2474
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:47,680
in which brains evolved so when you look
 

2475
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,750
in which brains evolved so when you look
at creatures who don't have brains and

2476
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:50,760
at creatures who don't have brains and
 

2477
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,670
at creatures who don't have brains and
you look at creatures who

2478
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:52,680
you look at creatures who
 

2479
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:56,190
you look at creatures who
do what's the difference

2480
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:56,200
do what's the difference
 

2481
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:00,910
do what's the difference
and um you can look at you know some

2482
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:00,920
and um you can look at you know some
 

2483
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:04,950
and um you can look at you know some
animals um so we call scientists call an

2484
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:04,960
animals um so we call scientists call an
 

2485
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,950
animals um so we call scientists call an
environment that an animal lives in a

2486
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:06,960
environment that an animal lives in a
 

2487
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,549
environment that an animal lives in a
niche their environmental Niche what are

2488
00:53:09,549 --> 00:53:09,559
niche their environmental Niche what are
 

2489
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:10,870
niche their environmental Niche what are
the things what are the parts of the

2490
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:10,880
the things what are the parts of the
 

2491
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,270
the things what are the parts of the
environment that matter to that animal

2492
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:13,280
environment that matter to that animal
 

2493
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,430
environment that matter to that animal
and um so there's some animals whose

2494
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:15,440
and um so there's some animals whose
 

2495
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,470
and um so there's some animals whose
Niche hasn't changed in 400 million

2496
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:17,480
Niche hasn't changed in 400 million
 

2497
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:20,150
Niche hasn't changed in 400 million
years so they're they're not these

2498
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:20,160
years so they're they're not these
 

2499
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,710
years so they're they're not these
creatures are modern creatures but

2500
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:21,720
creatures are modern creatures but
 

2501
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,710
creatures are modern creatures but
they're living in a niche that hasn't

2502
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:23,720
they're living in a niche that hasn't
 

2503
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:26,510
they're living in a niche that hasn't
changed much and so their biology hasn't

2504
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:26,520
changed much and so their biology hasn't
 

2505
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,789
changed much and so their biology hasn't
changed much and you can kind of verify

2506
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:28,799
changed much and you can kind of verify
 

2507
00:53:28,799 --> 00:53:31,150
changed much and you can kind of verify
that by looking at the genes that lur

2508
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:31,160
that by looking at the genes that lur
 

2509
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,549
that by looking at the genes that lur
deep you know in the molecular structure

2510
00:53:33,549 --> 00:53:33,559
deep you know in the molecular structure
 

2511
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:34,430
deep you know in the molecular structure
of

2512
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:34,440
of
 

2513
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:37,710
of
cells and so you can by looking at

2514
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:37,720
cells and so you can by looking at
 

2515
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:41,190
cells and so you can by looking at
various animals in their developmental

2516
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:41,200
various animals in their developmental
 

2517
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,950
various animals in their developmental
State meaning not you don't look at

2518
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:42,960
State meaning not you don't look at
 

2519
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,230
State meaning not you don't look at
adult animals you look at embryos of

2520
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:45,240
adult animals you look at embryos of
 

2521
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,990
adult animals you look at embryos of
animals and developing animals you can

2522
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:48,000
animals and developing animals you can
 

2523
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,910
animals and developing animals you can
see you can piece together a different

2524
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:49,920
see you can piece together a different
 

2525
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,510
see you can piece together a different
story and that story is that brains

2526
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:53,520
story and that story is that brains
 

2527
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,710
story and that story is that brains
evolved under

2528
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:55,720
evolved under
 

2529
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:59,270
evolved under
the selection pressure of hunting that

2530
00:53:59,270 --> 00:53:59,280
the selection pressure of hunting that
 

2531
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,750
the selection pressure of hunting that
in the Cambrian Period hunting emerged

2532
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:01,760
in the Cambrian Period hunting emerged
 

2533
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,349
in the Cambrian Period hunting emerged
on the scene where animals deliberately

2534
00:54:04,349 --> 00:54:04,359
on the scene where animals deliberately
 

2535
00:54:04,359 --> 00:54:09,750
on the scene where animals deliberately
ate one another um and what so you know

2536
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:09,760
ate one another um and what so you know
 

2537
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,750
ate one another um and what so you know
before the Cambrian Period the animals

2538
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:12,760
before the Cambrian Period the animals
 

2539
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,589
before the Cambrian Period the animals
didn't really have well they didn't have

2540
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:15,599
didn't really have well they didn't have
 

2541
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:18,750
didn't really have well they didn't have
brains but they also didn't have senses

2542
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:18,760
brains but they also didn't have senses
 

2543
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:21,470
brains but they also didn't have senses
really the very very rudimentary senses

2544
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:21,480
really the very very rudimentary senses
 

2545
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:25,309
really the very very rudimentary senses
so the animal that I wrote about in

2546
00:54:25,309 --> 00:54:25,319
so the animal that I wrote about in
 

2547
00:54:25,319 --> 00:54:27,430
so the animal that I wrote about in
seven and a half lessons is called an

2548
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:27,440
seven and a half lessons is called an
 

2549
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,950
seven and a half lessons is called an
amphioxys or a lancelet and um little

2550
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:31,960
amphioxys or a lancelet and um little
 

2551
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,990
amphioxys or a lancelet and um little
amphioxys has no eyes it has no ears it

2552
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:36,000
amphioxys has no eyes it has no ears it
 

2553
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,510
amphioxys has no eyes it has no ears it
has no nose it it it it has no eyes it

2554
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:39,520
has no nose it it it it has no eyes it
 

2555
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,710
has no nose it it it it has no eyes it
has a couple of cells for

2556
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:42,720
has a couple of cells for
 

2557
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,390
has a couple of cells for
um uh detecting light and dark for

2558
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:45,400
um uh detecting light and dark for
 

2559
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,430
um uh detecting light and dark for
circadian rhythm purposes so and it it

2560
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:49,440
circadian rhythm purposes so and it it
 

2561
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,710
circadian rhythm purposes so and it it
it can't hear it has a vestibular cell

2562
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:51,720
it can't hear it has a vestibular cell
 

2563
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:55,150
it can't hear it has a vestibular cell
to keep its body upright um it has a

2564
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:55,160
to keep its body upright um it has a
 

2565
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,789
to keep its body upright um it has a
very rudimentary sense of touch and it

2566
00:54:57,789 --> 00:54:57,799
very rudimentary sense of touch and it
 

2567
00:54:57,799 --> 00:55:00,430
very rudimentary sense of touch and it
doesn't really have any internal organs

2568
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:00,440
doesn't really have any internal organs
 

2569
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,950
doesn't really have any internal organs
other than this like basically stomach

2570
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:02,960
other than this like basically stomach
 

2571
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,270
other than this like basically stomach
it's like a just like a it doesn't it

2572
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:05,280
it's like a just like a it doesn't it
 

2573
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,870
it's like a just like a it doesn't it
doesn't have an enteric nervous system

2574
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:06,880
doesn't have an enteric nervous system
 

2575
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,750
doesn't have an enteric nervous system
it doesn't have like a gut that you know

2576
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:09,760
it doesn't have like a gut that you know
 

2577
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,789
it doesn't have like a gut that you know
moves like we do it just has basically a

2578
00:55:12,789 --> 00:55:12,799
moves like we do it just has basically a
 

2579
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:14,950
moves like we do it just has basically a
tube yeah um so it's like little

2580
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:14,960
tube yeah um so it's like little
 

2581
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,750
tube yeah um so it's like little
container like a little container yeah

2582
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:16,760
container like a little container yeah
 

2583
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:19,309
container like a little container yeah
and so and really it doesn't it doesn't

2584
00:55:19,309 --> 00:55:19,319
and so and really it doesn't it doesn't
 

2585
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:21,270
and so and really it doesn't it doesn't
move very much it can move it just sort

2586
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:21,280
move very much it can move it just sort
 

2587
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,029
move very much it can move it just sort
of wriggles it doesn't have very

2588
00:55:23,029 --> 00:55:23,039
of wriggles it doesn't have very
 

2589
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:25,349
of wriggles it doesn't have very
sophisticated movement and it's this

2590
00:55:25,349 --> 00:55:25,359
sophisticated movement and it's this
 

2591
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:28,510
sophisticated movement and it's this
really sweet little animal it sort of

2592
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:28,520
really sweet little animal it sort of
 

2593
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,870
really sweet little animal it sort of
wriggles its way to a spot and then

2594
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:30,880
wriggles its way to a spot and then
 

2595
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,910
wriggles its way to a spot and then
plants itself in the sand and just

2596
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:33,920
plants itself in the sand and just
 

2597
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:38,029
plants itself in the sand and just
filters food as the food goes by um and

2598
00:55:38,029 --> 00:55:38,039
filters food as the food goes by um and
 

2599
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:40,630
filters food as the food goes by um and
then when the food concentration

2600
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:40,640
then when the food concentration
 

2601
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,230
then when the food concentration
decreases it it just it it just um

2602
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:44,240
decreases it it just it it just um
 

2603
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,670
decreases it it just it it just um
ejects itself wriggles to the ne some

2604
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:46,680
ejects itself wriggles to the ne some
 

2605
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,910
ejects itself wriggles to the ne some
spot randomly where probabilistically

2606
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:48,920
spot randomly where probabilistically
 

2607
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,950
spot randomly where probabilistically
there will be more food and plants

2608
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:50,960
there will be more food and plants
 

2609
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,390
there will be more food and plants
itself again so it's it's not it's not

2610
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:54,400
itself again so it's it's not it's not
 

2611
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,230
itself again so it's it's not it's not
really aware

2612
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:56,240
really aware
 

2613
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,470
really aware
very aware that it has an environment it

2614
00:55:58,470 --> 00:55:58,480
very aware that it has an environment it
 

2615
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,670
very aware that it has an environment it
has a niche but that Niche is very small

2616
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:00,680
has a niche but that Niche is very small
 

2617
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,029
has a niche but that Niche is very small
and it's not really experiencing that

2618
00:56:03,029 --> 00:56:03,039
and it's not really experiencing that
 

2619
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:05,910
and it's not really experiencing that
Niche very much um so it's it's

2620
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:05,920
Niche very much um so it's it's
 

2621
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,390
Niche very much um so it's it's
basically like a little stomach on a

2622
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:07,400
basically like a little stomach on a
 

2623
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,789
basically like a little stomach on a
stick that's that's really what it is

2624
00:56:10,789 --> 00:56:10,799
stick that's that's really what it is
 

2625
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:15,990
stick that's that's really what it is
and um but but when animals start to

2626
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:16,000
and um but but when animals start to
 

2627
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,309
and um but but when animals start to
literally hunt each

2628
00:56:18,309 --> 00:56:18,319
literally hunt each
 

2629
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:22,069
literally hunt each
other um all of a sudden it becomes

2630
00:56:22,069 --> 00:56:22,079
other um all of a sudden it becomes
 

2631
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,510
other um all of a sudden it becomes
important to have to be able to sense

2632
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:24,520
important to have to be able to sense
 

2633
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,349
important to have to be able to sense
your envir ironment because you need to

2634
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:26,359
your envir ironment because you need to
 

2635
00:56:26,359 --> 00:56:29,710
your envir ironment because you need to
know is that blob up ahead going to eat

2636
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:29,720
know is that blob up ahead going to eat
 

2637
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,390
know is that blob up ahead going to eat
me or should I eat it mhm and so all of

2638
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:33,400
me or should I eat it mhm and so all of
 

2639
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,789
me or should I eat it mhm and so all of
a sudden you want distance senses are

2640
00:56:35,789 --> 00:56:35,799
a sudden you want distance senses are
 

2641
00:56:35,799 --> 00:56:39,390
a sudden you want distance senses are
very useful and so in the water distance

2642
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:39,400
very useful and so in the water distance
 

2643
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,069
very useful and so in the water distance
senses our

2644
00:56:41,069 --> 00:56:41,079
senses our
 

2645
00:56:41,079 --> 00:56:44,190
senses our
vision and a little bit

2646
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:44,200
vision and a little bit
 

2647
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:48,710
vision and a little bit
hearing um old faction smelling and

2648
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:48,720
hearing um old faction smelling and
 

2649
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,910
hearing um old faction smelling and
touch because in the water touch is a

2650
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:50,920
touch because in the water touch is a
 

2651
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,630
touch because in the water touch is a
distant sense because you can feel the

2652
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:52,640
distant sense because you can feel the
 

2653
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:57,670
distant sense because you can feel the
vibration so it's right so in um on air

2654
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:57,680
vibration so it's right so in um on air
 

2655
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,789
vibration so it's right so in um on air
on land you know vision is a distant

2656
00:56:59,789 --> 00:56:59,799
on land you know vision is a distant
 

2657
00:56:59,799 --> 00:57:01,829
on land you know vision is a distant
sense touch not so much but for

2658
00:57:01,829 --> 00:57:01,839
sense touch not so much but for
 

2659
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:05,510
sense touch not so much but for
Elephants maybe right um the vibrations

2660
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:05,520
Elephants maybe right um the vibrations
 

2661
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,430
Elephants maybe right um the vibrations
vibrations um all faction definitely

2662
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:08,440
vibrations um all faction definitely
 

2663
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,549
vibrations um all faction definitely
because of the concentration of you know

2664
00:57:10,549 --> 00:57:10,559
because of the concentration of you know
 

2665
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:12,230
because of the concentration of you know
the more concentrated something is the

2666
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:12,240
the more concentrated something is the
 

2667
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,670
the more concentrated something is the
more likely it is to be close to you so

2668
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:15,680
more likely it is to be close to you so
 

2669
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,390
more likely it is to be close to you so
animals developed senses they developed

2670
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:18,400
animals developed senses they developed
 

2671
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,870
animals developed senses they developed
a head like a literal head so aoys

2672
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:20,880
a head like a literal head so aoys
 

2673
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,230
a head like a literal head so aoys
doesn't even have a head really it's

2674
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:22,240
doesn't even have a head really it's
 

2675
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:25,750
doesn't even have a head really it's
just a what's the purpose of a head

2676
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:25,760
just a what's the purpose of a head
 

2677
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,029
just a what's the purpose of a head
that's a great question is it is it to

2678
00:57:28,029 --> 00:57:28,039
that's a great question is it is it to
 

2679
00:57:28,039 --> 00:57:31,470
that's a great question is it is it to
have a jaw that's a great question so

2680
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:31,480
have a jaw that's a great question so
 

2681
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:35,910
have a jaw that's a great question so
jaw so yes Jaws are a major um useful

2682
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:35,920
jaw so yes Jaws are a major um useful
 

2683
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,270
jaw so yes Jaws are a major um useful
feature yeah I would say they're a major

2684
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:38,280
feature yeah I would say they're a major
 

2685
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:41,069
feature yeah I would say they're a major
adaptation after there's a split between

2686
00:57:41,069 --> 00:57:41,079
adaptation after there's a split between
 

2687
00:57:41,079 --> 00:57:42,789
adaptation after there's a split between
vertebrates and invertebrates so

2688
00:57:42,789 --> 00:57:42,799
vertebrates and invertebrates so
 

2689
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:44,870
vertebrates and invertebrates so
amphioxys is thought to be very very

2690
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:44,880
amphioxys is thought to be very very
 

2691
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,910
amphioxys is thought to be very very
similar to the animal that's before that

2692
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:47,920
similar to the animal that's before that
 

2693
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,150
similar to the animal that's before that
split but then after the development

2694
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:50,160
split but then after the development
 

2695
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,309
split but then after the development
very quickly after the development of a

2696
00:57:52,309 --> 00:57:52,319
very quickly after the development of a
 

2697
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:54,470
very quickly after the development of a
head is the development of a jaw which

2698
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:54,480
head is the development of a jaw which
 

2699
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,549
head is the development of a jaw which
is a big big thing and um and what goes

2700
00:57:58,549 --> 00:57:58,559
is a big big thing and um and what goes
 

2701
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,950
is a big big thing and um and what goes
along with that is the development of a

2702
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:00,960
along with that is the development of a
 

2703
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,270
along with that is the development of a
brain it's weird is that just a

2704
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:03,280
brain it's weird is that just a
 

2705
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,750
brain it's weird is that just a
coincidence that the thing the part of

2706
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:06,760
coincidence that the thing the part of
 

2707
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:10,750
coincidence that the thing the part of
our body of the M mammal I think body

2708
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:10,760
our body of the M mammal I think body
 

2709
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:13,870
our body of the M mammal I think body
that we eat with and like attack others

2710
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:13,880
that we eat with and like attack others
 

2711
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,950
that we eat with and like attack others
with is also the thing that

2712
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:15,960
with is also the thing that
 

2713
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:20,630
with is also the thing that
contains the uh all the majority of the

2714
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:20,640
contains the uh all the majority of the
 

2715
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,750
contains the uh all the majority of the
brain type of well actually the brain

2716
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:22,760
brain type of well actually the brain
 

2717
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,069
brain type of well actually the brain
goes with the development of a head and

2718
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:25,079
goes with the development of a head and
 

2719
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:27,670
goes with the development of a head and
the development of of a visual system

2720
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:27,680
the development of of a visual system
 

2721
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,910
the development of of a visual system
and an auditory system and an old

2722
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:29,920
and an auditory system and an old
 

2723
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,349
and an auditory system and an old
factory system and so on so um your

2724
00:58:33,349 --> 00:58:33,359
factory system and so on so um your
 

2725
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:37,309
factory system and so on so um your
senses are developing and um and the

2726
00:58:37,309 --> 00:58:37,319
senses are developing and um and the
 

2727
00:58:37,319 --> 00:58:38,789
senses are developing and um and the
other thing that's happening right is

2728
00:58:38,789 --> 00:58:38,799
other thing that's happening right is
 

2729
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:40,349
other thing that's happening right is
that animals are getting

2730
00:58:40,349 --> 00:58:40,359
that animals are getting
 

2731
00:58:40,359 --> 00:58:42,670
that animals are getting
bigger yeah because their and also their

2732
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:42,680
bigger yeah because their and also their
 

2733
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,390
bigger yeah because their and also their
Niche is getting bigger well this is the

2734
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:45,400
Niche is getting bigger well this is the
 

2735
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,910
Niche is getting bigger well this is the
just sorry to take the tiny tangent on

2736
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:47,920
just sorry to take the tiny tangent on
 

2737
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,069
just sorry to take the tiny tangent on
the niche thing is uh it seems like the

2738
00:58:50,069 --> 00:58:50,079
the niche thing is uh it seems like the
 

2739
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:52,390
the niche thing is uh it seems like the
niche is getting bigger but not just

2740
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:52,400
niche is getting bigger but not just
 

2741
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,789
niche is getting bigger but not just
bigger like more complicated like shaped

2742
00:58:55,789 --> 00:58:55,799
bigger like more complicated like shaped
 

2743
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:58,549
bigger like more complicated like shaped
in weird ways so like predation seems to

2744
00:58:58,549 --> 00:58:58,559
in weird ways so like predation seems to
 

2745
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:02,069
in weird ways so like predation seems to
create like like the whole world becomes

2746
00:59:02,069 --> 00:59:02,079
create like like the whole world becomes
 

2747
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:04,190
create like like the whole world becomes
your oyster whatever but like you also

2748
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:04,200
your oyster whatever but like you also
 

2749
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,750
your oyster whatever but like you also
start to carve out like the places in

2750
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:06,760
start to carve out like the places in
 

2751
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,789
start to carve out like the places in
which you can operate the best yeah and

2752
00:59:08,789 --> 00:59:08,799
which you can operate the best yeah and
 

2753
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:10,870
which you can operate the best yeah and
in fact that's absolutely right and in

2754
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:10,880
in fact that's absolutely right and in
 

2755
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,589
in fact that's absolutely right and in
fact some scientists think that theory

2756
00:59:13,589 --> 00:59:13,599
fact some scientists think that theory
 

2757
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:16,470
fact some scientists think that theory
of mind your ability to make inferences

2758
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:16,480
of mind your ability to make inferences
 

2759
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:20,029
of mind your ability to make inferences
about the in inner life of of other

2760
00:59:20,029 --> 00:59:20,039
about the in inner life of of other
 

2761
00:59:20,039 --> 00:59:22,589
about the in inner life of of other
creatures actually developed under the

2762
00:59:22,589 --> 00:59:22,599
creatures actually developed under the
 

2763
00:59:22,599 --> 00:59:25,549
creatures actually developed under the
selection pressure of predation

2764
00:59:25,549 --> 00:59:25,559
selection pressure of predation
 

2765
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:27,950
selection pressure of predation
because it makes you a better Predator

2766
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:27,960
because it makes you a better Predator
 

2767
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,549
because it makes you a better Predator
do you ever look at you just said you

2768
00:59:29,549 --> 00:59:29,559
do you ever look at you just said you
 

2769
00:59:29,559 --> 00:59:34,029
do you ever look at you just said you
looked at at babies as these wiring

2770
00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:34,039
looked at at babies as these wiring
 

2771
00:59:34,039 --> 00:59:36,670
looked at at babies as these wiring
creatures do you ever think of humans as

2772
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:36,680
creatures do you ever think of humans as
 

2773
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,349
creatures do you ever think of humans as
just clever

2774
00:59:38,349 --> 00:59:38,359

Underneath It All is
this uh the nian will to power in all of

2780
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:48,000
this uh the nian will to power in all of
 

2781
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,230
this uh the nian will to power in all of
its forms or are we now

2782
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:51,240
its forms or are we now
 

2783
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:54,230
its forms or are we now
friendlier yeah so it's interesting I

2784
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:54,240
friendlier yeah so it's interesting I
 

2785
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,390
friendlier yeah so it's interesting I
mean there there there are Zeitgeist in

2786
00:59:57,390 --> 00:59:57,400
mean there there there are Zeitgeist in
 

2787
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,670
mean there there there are Zeitgeist in
how humans think about themselves right

2788
00:59:59,670 --> 00:59:59,680
how humans think about themselves right
 

2789
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,990
how humans think about themselves right
and so if you look in the 20th

2790
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:03,000
and so if you look in the 20th
 

2791
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,789
and so if you look in the 20th
century you can see that um the idea of

2792
01:00:06,789 --> 01:00:06,799
century you can see that um the idea of
 

2793
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:09,230
century you can see that um the idea of
an inner Beast that we just Predators

2794
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:09,240
an inner Beast that we just Predators
 

2795
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,430
an inner Beast that we just Predators
we're just basically animals baseless

2796
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:11,440
we're just basically animals baseless
 

2797
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,870
we're just basically animals baseless
animals violent animals that have to be

neocortex um really took hold

2804
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:22,400
neocortex um really took hold
 

2805
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,430
neocortex um really took hold
particularly after World War I

2806
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:25,440
particularly after World War I
 

2807
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:30,630
particularly after World War I
and really um held sway for much of that

2808
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:30,640
and really um held sway for much of that
 

2809
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:34,870
and really um held sway for much of that
Century um and then around at least in

2810
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:34,880
Century um and then around at least in
 

2811
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,270

humans are interesting creatures because
 

2843
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,750
humans are interesting creatures because
you know know other animals can also be

2844
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:26,760
you know know other animals can also be
 

2845
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,950
you know know other animals can also be
helpful to one another in fact there's a

2846
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:28,960
helpful to one another in fact there's a
 

2847
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,549
helpful to one another in fact there's a
whole literature booming literature on

2848
01:01:31,549 --> 01:01:31,559
whole literature booming literature on
 

2849
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:35,950
whole literature booming literature on
how other animals um are

2850
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:35,960
how other animals um are
 

2851
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,789
how other animals um are
um you know support one another they

2852
01:01:38,789 --> 01:01:38,799
um you know support one another they
 

2853
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:40,109
um you know support one another they
they regulate each other's nervous

2854
01:01:40,109 --> 01:01:40,119
they regulate each other's nervous
 

2855
01:01:40,119 --> 01:01:41,829
they regulate each other's nervous
systems in in interesting ways and they

2856
01:01:41,829 --> 01:01:41,839
systems in in interesting ways and they
 

2857
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:43,630
systems in in interesting ways and they
will be helpful to one another right so

2858
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:43,640
will be helpful to one another right so
 

2859
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,150
will be helpful to one another right so
for example there's a whole literature

2860
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:45,160
for example there's a whole literature
 

2861
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:49,309
for example there's a whole literature
on rodents and how um they um they

2862
01:01:49,309 --> 01:01:49,319
on rodents and how um they um they
 

2863
01:01:49,319 --> 01:01:51,990
on rodents and how um they um they
signal one another what is safe to eat

2864
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:52,000
signal one another what is safe to eat
 

2865
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,029
signal one another what is safe to eat
and uh they um will

2866
01:01:55,029 --> 01:01:55,039
and uh they um will
 

2867
01:01:55,039 --> 01:02:00,230
and uh they um will
um perform uh acts of generosity to

2868
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:00,240
um perform uh acts of generosity to
 

2869
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,510
um perform uh acts of generosity to
their consp specifics that are related

2870
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:02,520
their consp specifics that are related
 

2871
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:05,349
their consp specifics that are related
to them or or who they were raised with

2872
01:02:05,349 --> 01:02:05,359
to them or or who they were raised with
 

2873
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:08,069
to them or or who they were raised with
so if an animal was raised in a litter

2874
01:02:08,069 --> 01:02:08,079
so if an animal was raised in a litter
 

2875
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:09,789
so if an animal was raised in a litter
that is that they were raised in

2876
01:02:09,789 --> 01:02:09,799
that is that they were raised in
 

2877
01:02:09,799 --> 01:02:11,349
that is that they were raised in
although not even at the same time

2878
01:02:11,349 --> 01:02:11,359
although not even at the same time
 

2879
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:12,710
although not even at the same time
they'll be more likely to help that

2880
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:12,720
they'll be more likely to help that
 

2881
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,990
they'll be more likely to help that
animal so there's always some kind of

2882
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:15,000
animal so there's always some kind of
 

2883
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,950
animal so there's always some kind of
physical relationship between animals um

2884
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:18,960
physical relationship between animals um
 

2885
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,710
physical relationship between animals um
that predicts whether or not they'll

2886
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:20,720
that predicts whether or not they'll
 

2887
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:23,349
that predicts whether or not they'll
help one another for

2888
01:02:23,349 --> 01:02:23,359
help one another for
 

2889
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:26,430
help one another for
humans

2890
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:26,440

 

2891
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,109

humans you know we have ways of

2892
01:02:29,109 --> 01:02:29,119
humans you know we have ways of
 

2893
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,109
humans you know we have ways of
categorizing who's in our who's in our

2894
01:02:31,109 --> 01:02:31,119
categorizing who's in our who's in our
 

2895
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:34,390
categorizing who's in our who's in our
group and who isn't by non-physical ways

2896
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:34,400
group and who isn't by non-physical ways
 

2897
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,349
group and who isn't by non-physical ways
right by even by just something abstract

2898
01:02:36,349 --> 01:02:36,359
right by even by just something abstract
 

2899
01:02:36,359 --> 01:02:40,150
right by even by just something abstract
like an idea and we are much more likely

2900
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:40,160
like an idea and we are much more likely
 

2901
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:43,390
like an idea and we are much more likely
to extend help to people in our own

2902
01:02:43,390 --> 01:02:43,400
to extend help to people in our own
 

2903
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:46,150
to extend help to people in our own
group whatever that group may be um at

2904
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:46,160
group whatever that group may be um at
 

2905
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,670
group whatever that group may be um at
that moment whatever your whatever

2906
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:48,680
that moment whatever your whatever
 

2907
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,549
that moment whatever your whatever
feature you're using to Define who's in

2908
01:02:50,549 --> 01:02:50,559
feature you're using to Define who's in
 

2909
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:53,390
feature you're using to Define who's in
your group and who isn't um we're more

2910
01:02:53,390 --> 01:02:53,400
your group and who isn't um we're more
 

2911
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:56,670
your group and who isn't um we're more
likely to help those people than even

2912
01:02:56,670 --> 01:02:56,680
likely to help those people than even
 

2913
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:00,670
likely to help those people than even
members of our own family at times so

2914
01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:00,680
members of our own family at times so
 

2915
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:04,150
members of our own family at times so
humans are much more flexible in

2916
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:04,160
humans are much more flexible in
 

2917
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,470
humans are much more flexible in
their in the way that they help one

2918
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:06,480
their in the way that they help one
 

2919
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,109
their in the way that they help one
another but also in the way that they

01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:25,109
are primarily that I don't think have
humans have Essences in that way really

2932
01:03:25,109 --> 01:03:25,119
humans have Essences in that way really
 

2933
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:27,150
humans have Essences in that way really
I apologize to take us in this direction

2934
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:27,160
I apologize to take us in this direction
 

2935
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,430
I apologize to take us in this direction
for a brief moment but I've been really

2936
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:29,440
for a brief moment but I've been really
 

2937
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:32,990
for a brief moment but I've been really
deep on Stalin and Hitler recently uh in

2938
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:33,000
deep on Stalin and Hitler recently uh in
 

2939
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,589
deep on Stalin and Hitler recently uh in
terms of reading and is there something

2940
01:03:36,589 --> 01:03:36,599
terms of reading and is there something
 

2941
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:39,630
terms of reading and is there something
that you think about in terms of um the

2942
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:39,640
that you think about in terms of um the
 

2943
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:43,069
that you think about in terms of um the
nature of evil from a neuroscience

2944
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:43,079
nature of evil from a neuroscience
 

2945
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:47,150
nature of evil from a neuroscience
perspective is there some lessons that

2946
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:47,160
perspective is there some lessons that
 

2947
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:49,029
perspective is there some lessons that
are sort of

2948
01:03:49,029 --> 01:03:49,039
are sort of
 

2949
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:51,269
are sort of
um

2950
01:03:51,269 --> 01:03:51,279
um
 

2951
01:03:51,279 --> 01:03:55,870
um
hopeful about human civilization

2952
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:55,880
hopeful about human civilization
 

2953
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,349
hopeful about human civilization
that uh we can find in our brain with

2954
01:03:58,349 --> 01:03:58,359
that uh we can find in our brain with
 

2955
01:03:58,359 --> 01:04:01,190
that uh we can find in our brain with
regard to the Hitlers of the world do

2956
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:01,200
regard to the Hitlers of the world do
 

2957
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,589
regard to the Hitlers of the world do
you do you think about the the nature of

2958
01:04:04,589 --> 01:04:04,599
you do you think about the the nature of
 

2959
01:04:04,599 --> 01:04:08,910
you do you think about the the nature of
evil yeah I do I don't know that what I

2960
01:04:08,910 --> 01:04:08,920
evil yeah I do I don't know that what I
 

2961
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:12,549
evil yeah I do I don't know that what I
have to say is so useful from a I don't

2962
01:04:12,549 --> 01:04:12,559
have to say is so useful from a I don't
 

2963
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:14,029
have to say is so useful from a I don't
know that I can say as a neuroscientist

2964
01:04:14,029 --> 01:04:14,039
know that I can say as a neuroscientist
 

2965
01:04:14,039 --> 01:04:17,230
know that I can say as a neuroscientist
Well here here's a study that you know

2966
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:17,240
Well here here's a study that you know
 

2967
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:18,990
Well here here's a study that you know
what I so I I sort of have to take off

2968
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:19,000
what I so I I sort of have to take off
 

2969
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,069
what I so I I sort of have to take off
my lab coat right and now I'm going to

2970
01:04:21,069 --> 01:04:21,079
my lab coat right and now I'm going to
 

2971
01:04:21,079 --> 01:04:23,630
my lab coat right and now I'm going to
now conjecture as a human who just also

2972
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:23,640
now conjecture as a human who just also
 

2973
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,870
now conjecture as a human who just also
who has Ain I but who also maybe has

2974
01:04:25,870 --> 01:04:25,880
who has Ain I but who also maybe has
 

2975
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:28,349
who has Ain I but who also maybe has
some knowledge about Neuroscience but

2976
01:04:28,349 --> 01:04:28,359
some knowledge about Neuroscience but
 

2977
01:04:28,359 --> 01:04:30,029
some knowledge about Neuroscience but
I'm not speaking as a neuroscientist

2978
01:04:30,029 --> 01:04:30,039
I'm not speaking as a neuroscientist
 

2979
01:04:30,039 --> 01:04:31,470
I'm not speaking as a neuroscientist
when I say this because I don't think

2980
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:31,480
when I say this because I don't think
 

2981
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:33,789
when I say this because I don't think
neuroscientists know enough really to be

2982
01:04:33,789 --> 01:04:33,799
neuroscientists know enough really to be
 

2983
01:04:33,799 --> 01:04:36,589
neuroscientists know enough really to be
able to say but I guess I the kinds of

2984
01:04:36,589 --> 01:04:36,599
able to say but I guess I the kinds of
 

2985
01:04:36,599 --> 01:04:40,069
able to say but I guess I the kinds of
things I think about are

2986
01:04:40,069 --> 01:04:40,079
things I think about are
 

2987
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:44,430
things I think about are
um what so I have always thought even

2988
01:04:44,430 --> 01:04:44,440
um what so I have always thought even
 

2989
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:46,710
um what so I have always thought even
before I I knew anything about

2990
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:46,720
before I I knew anything about
 

2991
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:51,950
before I I knew anything about
Neuroscience um I've always thought that

2992
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:51,960

 

2993
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,510

um I don't think anybody could become

2994
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:54,520
um I don't think anybody could become
 

2995
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:57,069
um I don't think anybody could become
Hitler but I think the majority of

2996
01:04:57,069 --> 01:04:57,079
Hitler but I think the majority of
 

2997
01:04:57,079 --> 01:04:58,910
Hitler but I think the majority of
people can

2998
01:04:58,910 --> 01:04:58,920
people can
 

2999
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:02,750
people can
be can do are capable of doing very bad

3000
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:02,760
be can do are capable of doing very bad
 

3001
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:06,269
be can do are capable of doing very bad
things um it's just the question is

3002
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:06,279
things um it's just the question is
 

3003
01:05:06,279 --> 01:05:07,990
things um it's just the question is
really how much encouragement does it

3004
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:08,000
really how much encouragement does it
 

3005
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,670
really how much encouragement does it
take from the environment to get them to

3006
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:09,680
take from the environment to get them to
 

3007
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:12,230
take from the environment to get them to
do something bad that's what I kind of

3008
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:12,240
do something bad that's what I kind of
 

3009
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,549
do something bad that's what I kind of
when I look at the life of Hitler it

3010
01:05:14,549 --> 01:05:14,559
when I look at the life of Hitler it
 

3011
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:17,510
when I look at the life of Hitler it
seems like there's so many

3012
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:17,520
seems like there's so many
 

3013
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:20,109
seems like there's so many
places where something could have

3014
01:05:20,109 --> 01:05:20,119
places where something could have
 

3015
01:05:20,119 --> 01:05:22,990
places where something could have
intervened inter changed completely the

3016
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:23,000
intervened inter changed completely the
 

3017
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,510
intervened inter changed completely the
person I mean there's like the

3018
01:05:24,510 --> 01:05:24,520
person I mean there's like the
 

3019
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,950
person I mean there's like the
caricature like the obvious places where

3020
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:26,960
caricature like the obvious places where
 

3021
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,269
caricature like the obvious places where
he was an artist and if he wasn't

3022
01:05:29,269 --> 01:05:29,279
he was an artist and if he wasn't
 

3023
01:05:29,279 --> 01:05:30,589
he was an artist and if he wasn't
rejected as an artist he was a

3024
01:05:30,589 --> 01:05:30,599
rejected as an artist he was a
 

3025
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:32,630
rejected as an artist he was a
reasonably good artist so that that

3026
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:32,640
reasonably good artist so that that
 

3027
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,390
reasonably good artist so that that
could have changed but just his entire

3028
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:34,400
could have changed but just his entire
 

3029
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,950
could have changed but just his entire
like where he went in Vienna and all

3030
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:36,960
like where he went in Vienna and all
 

3031
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,430
like where he went in Vienna and all
these kinds of things like like little

3032
01:05:38,430 --> 01:05:38,440
these kinds of things like like little
 

3033
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:40,190
these kinds of things like like little
interactions could have changed and

3034
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:40,200
interactions could have changed and
 

3035
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:43,870
interactions could have changed and
there's probably millions of other uh

3036
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:43,880
there's probably millions of other uh
 

3037
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:46,950
there's probably millions of other uh
people who are uh capable who the

3038
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:46,960
people who are uh capable who the
 

3039
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,750
people who are uh capable who the
environment may be able to mold in the

3040
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:49,760
environment may be able to mold in the
 

3041
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,670
environment may be able to mold in the
same way it did this particular person

3042
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:51,680
same way it did this particular person
 

3043
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:54,910
same way it did this particular person
to create this particular kind of

3044
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:54,920
to create this particular kind of
 

3045
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:56,630
to create this particular kind of
charismatic leader in this particular

3046
01:05:56,630 --> 01:05:56,640
charismatic leader in this particular
 

3047
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,750
charismatic leader in this particular
moment of time absolutely and I guess

3048
01:05:58,750 --> 01:05:58,760
moment of time absolutely and I guess
 

3049
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:00,630
moment of time absolutely and I guess
the way I would the way that I would say

3050
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:00,640
the way I would the way that I would say
 

3051
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:03,150
the way I would the way that I would say
it I I would agree 100% And I guess the

3052
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:03,160
it I I would agree 100% And I guess the
 

3053
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,549
it I I would agree 100% And I guess the
way that I would say it is like

3054
01:06:05,549 --> 01:06:05,559
way that I would say it is like
 

3055
01:06:05,559 --> 01:06:10,150
way that I would say it is like
this in the west we have a way of

3056
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:10,160
this in the west we have a way of
 

3057
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:13,430
this in the west we have a way of
reasoning um about

3058
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:13,440
reasoning um about
 

3059
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:17,670
reasoning um about
causation which focuses on single simple

3060
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:17,680
causation which focuses on single simple
 

3061
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:21,230
causation which focuses on single simple
causes for things you know there's a

3062
01:06:21,230 --> 01:06:21,240
causes for things you know there's a
 

3063
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,029
causes for things you know there's a
there's an Essence to Hitler there's an

3064
01:06:23,029 --> 01:06:23,039
there's an Essence to Hitler there's an
 

3065
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:24,789
there's an Essence to Hitler there's an
Essence to his character

3066
01:06:24,789 --> 01:06:24,799
Essence to his character
 

3067
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:27,109
Essence to his character
he was born with that essence or it was

3068
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:27,119
he was born with that essence or it was
 

3069
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:30,589
he was born with that essence or it was
forged very very early in his life and

3070
01:06:30,589 --> 01:06:30,599
forged very very early in his life and
 

3071
01:06:30,599 --> 01:06:35,109
forged very very early in his life and
that explains the um the landscape of

3072
01:06:35,109 --> 01:06:35,119
that explains the um the landscape of
 

3073
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:37,589
that explains the um the landscape of
his the horrible landscape of his

3074
01:06:37,589 --> 01:06:37,599
his the horrible landscape of his
 

3075
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:40,390
his the horrible landscape of his
behavior but there's another way to

3076
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:40,400
behavior but there's another way to
 

3077
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,829
behavior but there's another way to
think about it a way that actually is

3078
01:06:41,829 --> 01:06:41,839
think about it a way that actually is
 

3079
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:43,549
think about it a way that actually is
much more consistent with what we know

3080
01:06:43,549 --> 01:06:43,559
much more consistent with what we know
 

3081
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:47,750
much more consistent with what we know
about biology how biology Works um in

3082
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:47,760
about biology how biology Works um in
 

3083
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,430
about biology how biology Works um in
the physical world and that is that most

3084
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:50,440
the physical world and that is that most
 

3085
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:53,190
the physical world and that is that most
things are complex not as in wow this is

3086
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:53,200
things are complex not as in wow this is
 

3087
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,109
things are complex not as in wow this is
really complex and hard hard but complex

3088
01:06:55,109 --> 01:06:55,119
really complex and hard hard but complex
 

3089
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:57,710
really complex and hard hard but complex
as in complexity that is more than the

3090
01:06:57,710 --> 01:06:57,720
as in complexity that is more than the
 

3091
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:00,710
as in complexity that is more than the
sum of their parts and that most

3092
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:00,720
sum of their parts and that most
 

3093
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:04,150
sum of their parts and that most
phenomena have many

3094
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:04,160
phenomena have many
 

3095
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:08,789
phenomena have many
many weak nonlinear interacting causes

3096
01:07:08,789 --> 01:07:08,799
many weak nonlinear interacting causes
 

3097
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:12,069
many weak nonlinear interacting causes
and so little things that we might not

3098
01:07:12,069 --> 01:07:12,079
and so little things that we might not
 

3099
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:15,510
and so little things that we might not
even be aware of can shift someone's

3100
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:15,520
even be aware of can shift someone's
 

3101
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,190
even be aware of can shift someone's
developmental trajectory from this to

3102
01:07:18,190 --> 01:07:18,200
developmental trajectory from this to
 

3103
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:21,269
developmental trajectory from this to
that and that's enough to take it on a

3104
01:07:21,269 --> 01:07:21,279
that and that's enough to take it on a
 

3105
01:07:21,279 --> 01:07:24,190
that and that's enough to take it on a
whole set of other paths that you know

3106
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:24,200
whole set of other paths that you know
 

3107
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:26,390
whole set of other paths that you know
that and that these things are happening

3108
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:26,400
that and that these things are happening
 

3109
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:30,470
that and that these things are happening
all the time so it's not random and it's

3110
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:30,480
all the time so it's not random and it's
 

3111
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,549
all the time so it's not random and it's
not really it's not deterministic in the

3112
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:32,559
not really it's not deterministic in the
 

3113
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:34,269
not really it's not deterministic in the
sense that like everything you do

3114
01:07:34,269 --> 01:07:34,279
sense that like everything you do
 

3115
01:07:34,279 --> 01:07:36,430
sense that like everything you do
determines your outcome but it's a

3116
01:07:36,430 --> 01:07:36,440
determines your outcome but it's a
 

3117
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:40,190
determines your outcome but it's a
little more like um you know you're

3118
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:40,200
little more like um you know you're
 

3119
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:43,829
little more like um you know you're
nudging someone from one set of

3120
01:07:43,829 --> 01:07:43,839
nudging someone from one set of
 

3121
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:45,430
nudging someone from one set of
possibilities to another set of

3122
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:45,440
possibilities to another set of
 

3123
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,630
possibilities to another set of
possibilities and I but I think the the

3124
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:47,640
possibilities and I but I think the the
 

3125
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:49,430
possibilities and I but I think the the
thing is the thing that I find

3126
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:49,440
thing is the thing that I find
 

3127
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,829
thing is the thing that I find
optimistic is that the the other side of

3128
01:07:52,829 --> 01:07:52,839
optimistic is that the the other side of
 

3129
01:07:52,839 --> 01:07:54,630
optimistic is that the the other side of
that coin is also

3130
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:54,640
that coin is also
 

3131
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:59,069
that coin is also
true right so look at all the people who

3132
01:07:59,069 --> 01:07:59,079
true right so look at all the people who
 

3133
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:03,910
true right so look at all the people who
risk their lives to help people they

3134
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:03,920
risk their lives to help people they
 

3135
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,269
risk their lives to help people they
didn't even

3136
01:08:05,269 --> 01:08:05,279
didn't even
 

3137
01:08:05,279 --> 01:08:08,589
didn't even
know I mean I just watched Borat the new

3138
01:08:08,589 --> 01:08:08,599
know I mean I just watched Borat the new
 

3139
01:08:08,599 --> 01:08:11,870
know I mean I just watched Borat the new
Borat movie and the thing that I came

3140
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:11,880
Borat movie and the thing that I came
 

3141
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,870
Borat movie and the thing that I came
away with but you know the thing I came

3142
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:13,880
away with but you know the thing I came
 

3143
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:15,070
away with but you know the thing I came
away with

3144
01:08:15,070 --> 01:08:15,080
away with
 

3145
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:18,910
away with
was look at how like generous people

was look at how like generous people
 

3147
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,749
was look at how like generous people
were in that because he's making there

3148
01:08:20,749 --> 01:08:20,759
were in that because he's making there
 

3149

were in that because he's making there
are a lot of people he makes fun of and

3151
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,510
are a lot of people he makes fun of and
that's fine but think about like those

3152
01:08:24,510 --> 01:08:24,520
that's fine but think about like those
 

3153
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:27,669
that's fine but think about like those

3197
01:09:24,679 --> 01:09:26,550
was more struck by like you know sure
there are other people who you know who

3198
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:26,560
there are other people who you know who
 

3199
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,470
there are other people who you know who
do do very bad things or say say bad

3200
01:09:29,470 --> 01:09:29,480
do do very bad things or say say bad
 

3201
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:32,390
do do very bad things or say say bad
things or or whatever but you know or

3202
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:32,400
things or or whatever but you know or
 

3203
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:34,070
things or or whatever but you know or
like there's one guy who's completely

3204
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:34,080
like there's one guy who's completely
 

3205
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:37,149
like there's one guy who's completely
stoic like the guy at the um who's doing

3206
01:09:37,149 --> 01:09:37,159
stoic like the guy at the um who's doing
 

3207
01:09:37,159 --> 01:09:39,110
stoic like the guy at the um who's doing
the like you know sending the messages I

3208
01:09:39,110 --> 01:09:39,120
the like you know sending the messages I
 

3209
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,709
the like you know sending the messages I
don't know if it's facts or whatever

3210
01:09:41,709 --> 01:09:41,719
don't know if it's facts or whatever
 

3211

he's just completely stoic but he's

3212
01:09:43,669 --> 01:09:43,679
he's just completely stoic but he's
 

3213
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,950
he's just completely stoic but he's
doing his job actually you know like you

3214
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:46,960
doing his job actually you know like you
 

3215
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:47,950
doing his job actually you know like you
can't you don't know what he was

3216
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:47,960
can't you don't know what he was
 

3217
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,110
can't you don't know what he was
thinking inside his head you don't know

3218
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:49,120
thinking inside his head you don't know
 

3219
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,510
thinking inside his head you don't know
what he was feeling but he was totally

3220
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:50,520
what he was feeling but he was totally
 

3221
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:53,789
what he was feeling but he was totally
professional doing his job so I guess I

3222
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:53,799
professional doing his job so I guess I
 

3223
01:09:53,799 --> 01:09:56,830
professional doing his job so I guess I
just I I had a a bit of a different um

3224
01:09:56,830 --> 01:09:56,840
just I I had a a bit of a different um
 

3225
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:59,390
just I I had a a bit of a different um
you know view I guess and I so I also

3226
01:09:59,390 --> 01:09:59,400
you know view I guess and I so I also
 

3227
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,709
you know view I guess and I so I also
think that about people I think

3228
01:10:01,709 --> 01:10:01,719
think that about people I think
 

3229
01:10:01,719 --> 01:10:05,430

but for but you know it's the question
 

3233
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,070
but for but you know it's the question
is how much does it take and what are

3234
01:10:09,070 --> 01:10:09,080
is how much does it take and what are
 

3235
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,550
is how much does it take and what are
the circumstances so for a lot some

3236
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:10,560
the circumstances so for a lot some
 

3237
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,270
the circumstances so for a lot some
people it's going to take a lot and for

3238
01:10:12,270 --> 01:10:12,280
people it's going to take a lot and for
 

3239
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:14,149
people it's going to take a lot and for
some people it only takes a little bit

3240
01:10:14,149 --> 01:10:14,159
some people it only takes a little bit
 

3241
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:17,790
some people it only takes a little bit
um but you know are we

3242
01:10:17,790 --> 01:10:17,800
um but you know are we
 

3243
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:21,550
um but you know are we
actually cultivating um an environment

3244
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:21,560
actually cultivating um an environment
 

3245
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:25,950
actually cultivating um an environment
for the Next Generation that

3246
01:10:25,950 --> 01:10:25,960
for the Next Generation that
 

3247
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:29,070
for the Next Generation that
um provides opportunities for people to

3248
01:10:29,070 --> 01:10:29,080
um provides opportunities for people to
 

3249
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:31,430
um provides opportunities for people to
go in the direction of caring and

3250
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:31,440
go in the direction of caring and
 

3251
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,870
go in the direction of caring and
kindness yeah or you know and I'm not

3252
01:10:33,870 --> 01:10:33,880
kindness yeah or you know and I'm not
 

3253
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,910
kindness yeah or you know and I'm not
I'm not saying that as like a you know

3254
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:35,920
I'm not saying that as like a you know
 

3255
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:40,630
I'm not saying that as like a you know
poana is uh person um I you know I think

3256
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:40,640
poana is uh person um I you know I think
 

3257
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,470
poana is uh person um I you know I think
there's a lot of room for competition

3258
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:42,480
there's a lot of room for competition
 

3259
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:46,790
there's a lot of room for competition
and debate and and so on um but I don't

3260
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:46,800
and debate and and so on um but I don't
 

3261
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,750
and debate and and so on um but I don't
see Hitler as an anomaly and I never

3262
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:49,760
see Hitler as an anomaly and I never
 

3263
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,350
see Hitler as an anomaly and I never
have that that was even before I I

3264
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:51,360
have that that was even before I I
 

3265
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:52,870
have that that was even before I I
learned anything about neuroscience and

3266
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:52,880
learned anything about neuroscience and
 

3267
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,990
learned anything about neuroscience and
now I was would say knowing what we know

3268
01:10:54,990 --> 01:10:55,000
now I was would say knowing what we know
 

3269
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,510
now I was would say knowing what we know
about Developmental trajectories and

3270
01:10:56,510 --> 01:10:56,520
about Developmental trajectories and
 

3271
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,990
about Developmental trajectories and
life histories and how important that is

3272
01:10:58,990 --> 01:10:59,000
life histories and how important that is
 

3273
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,510
life histories and how important that is
um you know knowing what we know about

3274
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:01,520
um you know knowing what we know about
 

3275
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:04,189
um you know knowing what we know about
um that the whole question of like

3276
01:11:04,189 --> 01:11:04,199
um that the whole question of like
 

3277
01:11:04,199 --> 01:11:06,189
um that the whole question of like
nature versus nurture is a completely

3278
01:11:06,189 --> 01:11:06,199
nature versus nurture is a completely
 

3279
01:11:06,199 --> 01:11:08,669
nature versus nurture is a completely
wrong question you know we have the kind

3280
01:11:08,669 --> 01:11:08,679
wrong question you know we have the kind
 

3281
01:11:08,679 --> 01:11:11,310
wrong question you know we have the kind
of nature that requires nurture we have

3282
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:11,320
of nature that requires nurture we have
 

3283
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:14,270
of nature that requires nurture we have
the kind of genes that allow infants to

3284
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:14,280
the kind of genes that allow infants to
 

3285
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:17,189
the kind of genes that allow infants to
be born with unfinished brains where the

3286
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:17,199
be born with unfinished brains where the
 

3287
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:20,350
be born with unfinished brains where the
brains their brains are wired across a

3288
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:20,360
brains their brains are wired across a
 

3289
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,950
brains their brains are wired across a
25-year period with wiring instructions

3290
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:22,960
25-year period with wiring instructions
 

3291
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:26,350
25-year period with wiring instructions
from the world that is created for them

3292
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:26,360
from the world that is created for them
 

3293
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:29,950
from the world that is created for them
and so I don't think Hitler is an

3294
01:11:29,950 --> 01:11:29,960
and so I don't think Hitler is an
 

3295
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:33,790
and so I don't think Hitler is an
anomaly um you know even if it's even if

3296
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:33,800
anomaly um you know even if it's even if
 

3297
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:36,470
anomaly um you know even if it's even if
it's less probable that that would

3298
01:11:36,470 --> 01:11:36,480
it's less probable that that would
 

3299
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,310
it's less probable that that would
happen it's possible that it could

3300
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:38,320
happen it's possible that it could
 

3301
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:41,229
happen it's possible that it could
happen again and it's not it's not like

3302
01:11:41,229 --> 01:11:41,239
happen again and it's not it's not like
 

3303
01:11:41,239 --> 01:11:43,669
happen again and it's not it's not like
you know he's a bad seed I mean that

3304
01:11:43,669 --> 01:11:43,679
you know he's a bad seed I mean that
 

3305
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:46,030
you know he's a bad seed I mean that
doesn't I just want to say for like of

3306
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:46,040
doesn't I just want to say for like of
 

3307
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,910
doesn't I just want to say for like of
course he's completely 100% responsible

3308
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:47,920
course he's completely 100% responsible
 

3309
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,590
course he's completely 100% responsible
for his actions and all the bad things

3310
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:49,600
for his actions and all the bad things
 

3311
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,790
for his actions and all the bad things
that happen so I'm not in any way this

3312
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:51,800
that happen so I'm not in any way this
 

3313
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,870
that happen so I'm not in any way this
is not me saying but the environment is

3314
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:54,880
is not me saying but the environment is
 

3315
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,910
is not me saying but the environment is
also responsible in part for creating

3316
01:11:56,910 --> 01:11:56,920
also responsible in part for creating
 

3317
01:11:56,920 --> 01:12:00,550
also responsible in part for creating
the evil in in this world so like

3318
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:00,560
the evil in in this world so like
 

3319
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,470
the evil in in this world so like
Hitler's and

3320
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:02,480
Hitler's and
 

3321
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,189
Hitler's and
different versions of even more subtle

3322
01:12:05,189 --> 01:12:05,199
different versions of even more subtle
 

3323
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:07,510
different versions of even more subtle
more smaller scale versions of evil but

3324
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:07,520
more smaller scale versions of evil but
 

3325
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:12,110
more smaller scale versions of evil but
I tend to believe that uh there's a much

3326
01:12:12,110 --> 01:12:12,120
I tend to believe that uh there's a much
 

3327
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:15,189
I tend to believe that uh there's a much
stronger uh I I don't like to talk about

3328
01:12:15,189 --> 01:12:15,199
stronger uh I I don't like to talk about
 

3329
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:17,270
stronger uh I I don't like to talk about
evolutionary advantages but it seems

3330
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:17,280
evolutionary advantages but it seems
 

3331
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:21,149
evolutionary advantages but it seems
like it makes sense for love to be a

3332
01:12:21,149 --> 01:12:21,159
like it makes sense for love to be a
 

3333
01:12:21,159 --> 01:12:22,070
like it makes sense for love to be a
more

3334
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:22,080
more
 

3335
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:25,550
more
powerful uh emerging phenomena of our

3336
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:25,560
powerful uh emerging phenomena of our
 

3337
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:28,790
powerful uh emerging phenomena of our
collective intelligence versus hate and

3338
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:28,800
collective intelligence versus hate and
 

3339
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,950
collective intelligence versus hate and
evil and destruction because from a

3340
01:12:31,950 --> 01:12:31,960
evil and destruction because from a
 

3341
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:34,470
evil and destruction because from a
survival from a niche perspective it

3342
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:34,480
survival from a niche perspective it
 

3343
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,070
survival from a niche perspective it
seems to be

3344
01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:36,080
seems to be
 

3345
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,910
seems to be
uh like for in my own life in my

3346
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:38,920
uh like for in my own life in my
 

3347
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:41,229
uh like for in my own life in my
thinking about the intuition about the

3348
01:12:41,229 --> 01:12:41,239
thinking about the intuition about the
 

3349
01:12:41,239 --> 01:12:43,590
thinking about the intuition about the
way humans work together to solve

3350
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:43,600
way humans work together to solve
 

3351
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,430
way humans work together to solve
problems it seems that love is a very

3352
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:46,440
problems it seems that love is a very
 

3353
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:49,990
problems it seems that love is a very
useful tool I definitely agree with you

3354
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:50,000
useful tool I definitely agree with you
 

3355
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,870
useful tool I definitely agree with you
but I think the caveat here is that um

3356
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:53,880
but I think the caveat here is that um
 

3357
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:56,790
but I think the caveat here is that um
you know humans the research suggests

3358
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:56,800
you know humans the research suggests
 

3359
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:01,390
you know humans the research suggests
that humans are are capable of great act

3360
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:01,400
that humans are are capable of great act
 

3361
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:04,430
that humans are are capable of great act
of kindness and great acts of generosity

3362
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:04,440
of kindness and great acts of generosity
 

3363
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,430
of kindness and great acts of generosity
to people in their

3364
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:06,440
to people in their
 

3365
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:08,110
to people in their
ingroup

3366
01:13:08,110 --> 01:13:08,120
ingroup
 

3367
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:10,830
ingroup
right and so we're also

3368
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:10,840
right and so we're also
 

3369
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:13,070
right and so we're also
tribal yeah I mean that's the K that's

3370
01:13:13,070 --> 01:13:13,080
tribal yeah I mean that's the K that's
 

3371
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,990
tribal yeah I mean that's the K that's
the kitchy way to say it we're tribes

3372
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:15,000
the kitchy way to say it we're tribes
 

3373
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,390
the kitchy way to say it we're tribes
we're tribal yeah so that's the kitchy

3374
01:13:17,390 --> 01:13:17,400
we're tribal yeah so that's the kitchy
 

3375
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:20,390
we're tribal yeah so that's the kitchy
way to say it what I would say is

3376
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:20,400
way to say it what I would say is
 

3377
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:24,830
way to say it what I would say is
that you know there are a lot of

3378
01:13:24,830 --> 01:13:24,840
that you know there are a lot of
 

3379
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:27,629
that you know there are a lot of
features that you can use to describe

3380
01:13:27,629 --> 01:13:27,639
features that you can use to describe
 

3381
01:13:27,639 --> 01:13:30,189
features that you can use to describe
yourself you don't have one identity you

3382
01:13:30,189 --> 01:13:30,199
yourself you don't have one identity you
 

3383
01:13:30,199 --> 01:13:32,070
yourself you don't have one identity you
don't have one self you have many selves

3384
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:32,080
don't have one self you have many selves
 

3385
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,910
don't have one self you have many selves
you have many identities um sometimes

3386
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:34,920
you have many identities um sometimes
 

3387
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:36,590
you have many identities um sometimes
you're a man sometimes you're a

3388
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:36,600
you're a man sometimes you're a
 

3389
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,950
you're a man sometimes you're a
scientist sometimes you're a you have a

3390
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:38,960
scientist sometimes you're a you have a
 

3391
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,229
scientist sometimes you're a you have a
brother or a sister brother so sometimes

you're a brother you know you you
 

3395
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,470
you're a brother you know you you
sometimes you're a friend sometimes

3396
01:13:45,470 --> 01:13:45,480
sometimes you're a friend sometimes
 

3397
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:47,709
sometimes you're a friend sometimes
you're human so you can keep zooming out

3398
01:13:47,709 --> 01:13:47,719
you're human so you can keep zooming out
 

3399
01:13:47,719 --> 01:13:50,590
you're human so you can keep zooming out
yes living organism on Earth yes exactly

3400
01:13:50,590 --> 01:13:50,600
yes living organism on Earth yes exactly
 

3401
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:53,990
yes living organism on Earth yes exactly
that's exactly that's exactly right and

3402
01:13:53,990 --> 01:13:54,000
that's exactly that's exactly right and
 

3403
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,229
that's exactly that's exactly right and
so um there are there are some people

3404
01:13:58,229 --> 01:13:58,239
so um there are there are some people
 

3405
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:01,830
so um there are there are some people
who there is research which suggests

3406
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:01,840
who there is research which suggests
 

3407
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,950
who there is research which suggests
that um there are some people who will

3408
01:14:03,950 --> 01:14:03,960
that um there are some people who will
 

3409
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,870
that um there are some people who will
tell you I think it's appropriate and

3410
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:06,880
tell you I think it's appropriate and
 

3411
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:09,750
tell you I think it's appropriate and
better to help I should help my family

3412
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:09,760
better to help I should help my family
 

3413
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,430
better to help I should help my family
more than I should help my neighbors and

3414
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:11,440
more than I should help my neighbors and
 

3415
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,990
more than I should help my neighbors and
I should help my neighbors more than I

3416
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:13,000
I should help my neighbors more than I
 

3417
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,629
I should help my neighbors more than I
should help the average stranger and I

3418
01:14:15,629 --> 01:14:15,639
should help the average stranger and I
 

3419
01:14:15,639 --> 01:14:18,709
should help the average stranger and I
should help um you know the average

3420
01:14:18,709 --> 01:14:18,719
should help um you know the average
 

3421
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:20,350
should help um you know the average
stranger in my country more than I

3422
01:14:20,350 --> 01:14:20,360
stranger in my country more than I
 

3423
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,149
stranger in my country more than I
should help somebody outside my country

3424
01:14:22,149 --> 01:14:22,159
should help somebody outside my country
 

3425
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:24,709
should help somebody outside my country
and I should help humans more than I

3426
01:14:24,709 --> 01:14:24,719
and I should help humans more than I
 

3427
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:26,870
and I should help humans more than I
should help you know other animals and I

3428
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:26,880
should help you know other animals and I
 

3429
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,470
should help you know other animals and I
right so there's a clear hierarchy of

3430
01:14:28,470 --> 01:14:28,480
right so there's a clear hierarchy of
 

3431
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:31,709
right so there's a clear hierarchy of
helping and there are other people who

3432
01:14:31,709 --> 01:14:31,719
helping and there are other people who
 

3433
01:14:31,719 --> 01:14:35,510
helping and there are other people who
um you know they are their Niche is much

3434
01:14:35,510 --> 01:14:35,520
um you know they are their Niche is much
 

3435
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:39,310
um you know they are their Niche is much
more inclusive right and that they're

3436
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:39,320
more inclusive right and that they're
 

3437
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:41,950
more inclusive right and that they're
humans first right or or creatures of

3438
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:41,960
humans first right or or creatures of
 

3439
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:46,830
humans first right or or creatures of
the Earth first let's say um and I I

3440
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:46,840
the Earth first let's say um and I I
 

3441
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:49,709
the Earth first let's say um and I I
don't think we know how flexible those

3442
01:14:49,709 --> 01:14:49,719
don't think we know how flexible those
 

3443
01:14:49,719 --> 01:14:51,950
don't think we know how flexible those
attitudes are because I don't think the

3444
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:51,960
attitudes are because I don't think the
 

3445
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,990
attitudes are because I don't think the
research really tells us that

3446
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:54,000
research really tells us that
 

3447
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,950
research really tells us that
but in any case there are you know and

3448
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:56,960
but in any case there are you know and
 

3449
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,910
but in any case there are you know and
there are beliefs people also have

3450
01:14:58,910 --> 01:14:58,920
there are beliefs people also have
 

3451
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,590
there are beliefs people also have
beliefs about there's this really

3452
01:15:00,590 --> 01:15:00,600
beliefs about there's this really
 

3453
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:04,310
beliefs about there's this really
interesting research in um really in

3454
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:04,320
interesting research in um really in
 

3455
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:07,390
interesting research in um really in
anthropology um that looks

3456
01:15:07,390 --> 01:15:07,400
anthropology um that looks
 

3457
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:12,030
anthropology um that looks
at what are cultures particularly afraid

3458
01:15:12,030 --> 01:15:12,040
at what are cultures particularly afraid
 

3459
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:14,270
at what are cultures particularly afraid
of like what the people in a particular

3460
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:14,280
of like what the people in a particular
 

3461
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,790
of like what the people in a particular
culture are organizing their social

3462
01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:16,800
culture are organizing their social
 

3463
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,590
culture are organizing their social
systems to prevent certain types of

3464
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:19,600
systems to prevent certain types of
 

3465
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,990
systems to prevent certain types of
problems so what are the problems that

3466
01:15:20,990 --> 01:15:21,000
problems so what are the problems that
 

3467
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,990
problems so what are the problems that
they're worried about and and so there

3468
01:15:22,990 --> 01:15:23,000
they're worried about and and so there
 

3469
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,070
they're worried about and and so there
are some cultures that are much more

3470
01:15:25,070 --> 01:15:25,080
are some cultures that are much more
 

3471
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:28,270
are some cultures that are much more
hierarchical and some cultures that are

3472
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:28,280
hierarchical and some cultures that are
 

3473
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:30,709
hierarchical and some cultures that are
you know much more egalitarian there are

3474
01:15:30,709 --> 01:15:30,719
you know much more egalitarian there are
 

3475
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:32,950
you know much more egalitarian there are
some cultures that you know in the

3476
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:32,960
some cultures that you know in the
 

3477
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,950
some cultures that you know in the
debate of like getting along versus

3478
01:15:34,950 --> 01:15:34,960
debate of like getting along versus
 

3479
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,750
debate of like getting along versus
getting ahead there are some cultures

3480
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:36,760
getting ahead there are some cultures
 

3481
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:39,390
getting ahead there are some cultures
that really prioritize the individual

3482
01:15:39,390 --> 01:15:39,400
that really prioritize the individual
 

3483
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:40,629
that really prioritize the individual
over the group and there are other

3484
01:15:40,629 --> 01:15:40,639
over the group and there are other
 

3485
01:15:40,639 --> 01:15:41,910
over the group and there are other
cultures that really prioritize the

3486
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:41,920
cultures that really prioritize the
 

3487
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:44,030
cultures that really prioritize the
group over the individual you know it's

3488
01:15:44,030 --> 01:15:44,040
group over the individual you know it's
 

3489
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,510
group over the individual you know it's
not like one of these is right and one

3490
01:15:45,510 --> 01:15:45,520
not like one of these is right and one
 

3491
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:47,870
not like one of these is right and one
of these is wrong it's that you know

3492
01:15:47,870 --> 01:15:47,880
of these is wrong it's that you know
 

3493
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:49,550
of these is wrong it's that you know
different combinations of these features

3494
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:49,560
different combinations of these features
 

3495
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:52,350
different combinations of these features
are different solutions that humans have

3496
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:52,360
are different solutions that humans have
 

3497
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:55,629
are different solutions that humans have
come up with for for living in groups

3498
01:15:55,629 --> 01:15:55,639
come up with for for living in groups
 

3499
01:15:55,639 --> 01:15:57,270
come up with for for living in groups
which is a major adaptive advantage of

3500
01:15:57,270 --> 01:15:57,280
which is a major adaptive advantage of
 

3501
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:58,070
which is a major adaptive advantage of
our

3502
01:15:58,070 --> 01:15:58,080
our
 

3503
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:01,550
our
species um and it's not the case that

3504
01:16:01,550 --> 01:16:01,560
species um and it's not the case that
 

3505
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,149
species um and it's not the case that
one of these is better and one of these

3506
01:16:03,149 --> 01:16:03,159
one of these is better and one of these
 

3507
01:16:03,159 --> 01:16:05,750
one of these is better and one of these
is worse although as a person of course

3508
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:05,760
is worse although as a person of course
 

3509
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,990
is worse although as a person of course
I have opinions about that and as a

3510
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:08,000
I have opinions about that and as a
 

3511
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,229
I have opinions about that and as a
person right I I can say I would very

3512
01:16:11,229 --> 01:16:11,239
person right I I can say I would very
 

3513
01:16:11,239 --> 01:16:13,510
person right I I can say I would very
much prefer certain I have certain

3514
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:13,520
much prefer certain I have certain
 

3515
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:15,270
much prefer certain I have certain
beliefs and I really want everyone in

3516
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:15,280
beliefs and I really want everyone in
 

3517
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,830
beliefs and I really want everyone in
the world to live by those beliefs you

3518
01:16:16,830 --> 01:16:16,840
the world to live by those beliefs you
 

3519
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:20,149
the world to live by those beliefs you
know but as a scientist I know that it's

3520
01:16:20,149 --> 01:16:20,159
know but as a scientist I know that it's
 

3521
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:24,149
know but as a scientist I know that it's
not really the case that for the species

3522
01:16:24,149 --> 01:16:24,159
not really the case that for the species
 

3523
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:26,270
not really the case that for the species
any one of these is better than any

3524
01:16:26,270 --> 01:16:26,280
any one of these is better than any
 

3525
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,229
any one of these is better than any
other they're different solutions that

other they're different solutions that
 

3527
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:31,470
other they're different solutions that
work differentially well in

01:16:31,470 --> 01:16:31,480
work differentially well in

01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:35,229
work differentially well in
particular you know ecological parts of

01:16:35,229 --> 01:16:35,239
particular you know ecological parts of
 

3531
01:16:35,239 --> 01:16:38,110
particular you know ecological parts of
the world but for individual

3532
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:38,120
the world but for individual
 

3533
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:41,430

humans there are definitely some systems

3534
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:41,440
humans there are definitely some systems
 

3535
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:42,870
humans there are definitely some systems
that are better and some systems that

that are better and some systems that
 

3537
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,590
that are better and some systems that
are worse right but when when

01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:44,600
are worse right but when when

01:16:58,070 --> 01:16:58,080
species and what's better for the
 

3553
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,590
species and what's better for the
survivability of the species is

3554
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:00,600
survivability of the species is
 

3555
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:03,629
survivability of the species is
variation that we have lots of cultures

3556
01:17:03,629 --> 01:17:03,639
variation that we have lots of cultures
 

3557
01:17:03,639 --> 01:17:06,750
variation that we have lots of cultures
with lots of different solutions because

3558
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:06,760
with lots of different solutions because
 

3559
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:10,189
with lots of different solutions because
if the environment were to change

3560
01:17:10,189 --> 01:17:10,199
if the environment were to change
 

3561
01:17:10,199 --> 01:17:14,750
if the environment were to change
drastically um some uh some of those

3562
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:14,760
drastically um some uh some of those
 

3563
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:17,550
drastically um some uh some of those
Solutions will work better than others

3564
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:17,560
Solutions will work better than others
 

3565
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:21,550
Solutions will work better than others
and you can see that happening with coid

3566
01:17:21,550 --> 01:17:21,560
and you can see that happening with coid
 

3567
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:23,110
and you can see that happening with coid
right so some people might be more

3568
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:23,120
right so some people might be more
 

3569
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,229
right so some people might be more
susceptible to this this virus and

3570
01:17:25,229 --> 01:17:25,239
susceptible to this this virus and
 

3571
01:17:25,239 --> 01:17:28,390
susceptible to this this virus and
others and so variation is very useful

3572
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:28,400
others and so variation is very useful
 

3573
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,709
others and so variation is very useful
say Co was much much more destructive

3574
01:17:30,709 --> 01:17:30,719
say Co was much much more destructive
 

3575
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:33,870
say Co was much much more destructive
than it is and like I don't know 20% of

3576
01:17:33,870 --> 01:17:33,880
than it is and like I don't know 20% of
 

3577
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:37,950
than it is and like I don't know 20% of
the population was died uh you know

3578
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:37,960
the population was died uh you know
 

3579
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:40,270
the population was died uh you know
that's it's good to have variability

3580
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:40,280
that's it's good to have variability
 

3581
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:42,030
that's it's good to have variability
because then at least some percent Will

3582
01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:42,040
because then at least some percent Will
 

3583
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:44,910
because then at least some percent Will
Survive yeah I mean the the you know the

3584
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:44,920
Survive yeah I mean the the you know the
 

3585
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:47,189
Survive yeah I mean the the you know the
way that I used to describe it was you

3586
01:17:47,189 --> 01:17:47,199
way that I used to describe it was you
 

3587
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:51,310
way that I used to describe it was you
know um using uh you know those movies

3588
01:17:51,310 --> 01:17:51,320
know um using uh you know those movies
 

3589
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:54,149
know um using uh you know those movies
like The War of the Worlds or or um

3590
01:17:54,149 --> 01:17:54,159
like The War of the Worlds or or um
 

3591
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:56,990
like The War of the Worlds or or um
Pacific Rim you know where like aliens

3592
01:17:56,990 --> 01:17:57,000
Pacific Rim you know where like aliens
 

3593
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,590
Pacific Rim you know where like aliens
come down from outer space and they you

3594
01:17:59,590 --> 01:17:59,600
come down from outer space and they you
 

3595
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,790
come down from outer space and they you
know want to kill humans and so all the

3596
01:18:01,790 --> 01:18:01,800
know want to kill humans and so all the
 

3597
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,550
know want to kill humans and so all the
humans band together as a species like

3598
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:04,560
humans band together as a species like
 

3599
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,390
humans band together as a species like
and they all like all the you know

3600
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:06,400
and they all like all the you know
 

3601
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,510
and they all like all the you know
little squabbling from countries and

3602
01:18:08,510 --> 01:18:08,520
little squabbling from countries and
 

3603
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:10,629
little squabbling from countries and
whatever all go you know goes away and

3604
01:18:10,629 --> 01:18:10,639
whatever all go you know goes away and
 

3605
01:18:10,639 --> 01:18:14,550
whatever all go you know goes away and
everyone is just one big you know

3606
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:14,560
everyone is just one big you know
 

3607
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:19,709
everyone is just one big you know
well that you know that doesn't happen I

3608
01:18:19,709 --> 01:18:19,719
well that you know that doesn't happen I
 

3609
01:18:19,719 --> 01:18:22,070
well that you know that doesn't happen I
mean because coid is you know the vi a

3610
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:22,080
mean because coid is you know the vi a
 

3611
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,669
mean because coid is you know the vi a
virus uh

3612
01:18:24,669 --> 01:18:24,679
virus uh
 

3613
01:18:24,679 --> 01:18:28,590
virus uh
like Co like Co 19 is like a creature

3614
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:28,600
like Co like Co 19 is like a creature
 

3615
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,750
like Co like Co 19 is like a creature
from outer space and that's not what you

3616
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:30,760
from outer space and that's not what you
 

3617
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:33,189
from outer space and that's not what you
see happening what you do see happening

3618
01:18:33,189 --> 01:18:33,199
see happening what you do see happening
 

3619
01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:35,629
see happening what you do see happening
it is true that some people I mean we

3620
01:18:35,629 --> 01:18:35,639
it is true that some people I mean we
 

3621
01:18:35,639 --> 01:18:36,830
it is true that some people I mean we
could use this as an example of

3622
01:18:36,830 --> 01:18:36,840
could use this as an example of
 

3623
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:39,390
could use this as an example of
essentialism also so just to say like

3624
01:18:39,390 --> 01:18:39,400
essentialism also so just to say like
 

3625
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:41,270
essentialism also so just to say like
exposure to the virus does not mean that

3626
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:41,280
exposure to the virus does not mean that
 

3627
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:44,110
exposure to the virus does not mean that
you will become infected with a

3628
01:18:44,110 --> 01:18:44,120
you will become infected with a
 

3629
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:48,189
you will become infected with a
disease so I mean in controlled studies

3630
01:18:48,189 --> 01:18:48,199
disease so I mean in controlled studies
 

3631
01:18:48,199 --> 01:18:50,750
disease so I mean in controlled studies
one of which was actually a Corona virus

3632
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:50,760
one of which was actually a Corona virus
 

3633
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,910
one of which was actually a Corona virus
not coid but an this was these are

3634
01:18:52,910 --> 01:18:52,920
not coid but an this was these are
 

3635
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:55,430
not coid but an this was these are
studies from 10 or so years ago you know

3636
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:55,440
studies from 10 or so years ago you know
 

3637
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:58,270
studies from 10 or so years ago you know
only somewhere between 20 and 40% of

3638
01:18:58,270 --> 01:18:58,280
only somewhere between 20 and 40% of
 

3639
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:01,149
only somewhere between 20 and 40% of
people uh were developed respiratory

3640
01:19:01,149 --> 01:19:01,159
people uh were developed respiratory
 

3641
01:19:01,159 --> 01:19:03,910
people uh were developed respiratory
illness when a virus was placed in their

3642
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:03,920
illness when a virus was placed in their
 

3643
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:07,910
illness when a virus was placed in their
nose yeah um and so then there's a dose

3644
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:07,920
nose yeah um and so then there's a dose
 

3645
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,709
nose yeah um and so then there's a dose
question all those well not in these

3646
01:19:09,709 --> 01:19:09,719
question all those well not in these
 

3647
01:19:09,719 --> 01:19:11,629
question all those well not in these
studies actually so in these studies the

3648
01:19:11,629 --> 01:19:11,639
studies actually so in these studies the
 

3649
01:19:11,639 --> 01:19:15,510
studies actually so in these studies the
dose was consistent across all people um

3650
01:19:15,510 --> 01:19:15,520
dose was consistent across all people um
 

3651
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:17,229
dose was consistent across all people um
and everything you know they were

3652
01:19:17,229 --> 01:19:17,239
and everything you know they were
 

3653
01:19:17,239 --> 01:19:19,470
and everything you know they were
sequestered in hotel rooms and what they

3654
01:19:19,470 --> 01:19:19,480
sequestered in hotel rooms and what they
 

3655
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:22,070
sequestered in hotel rooms and what they
ate was you know um measured out by

3656
01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:22,080
ate was you know um measured out by
 

3657
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:24,310
ate was you know um measured out by
scientists and so on and so when you

3658
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:24,320
scientists and so on and so when you
 

3659
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,629
scientists and so on and so when you
hold dose I mean the dose issue is a

3660
01:19:26,629 --> 01:19:26,639
hold dose I mean the dose issue is a
 

3661
01:19:26,639 --> 01:19:29,910
hold dose I mean the dose issue is a
real issue in the real world but um in

3662
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:29,920
real issue in the real world but um in
 

3663
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:33,110
real issue in the real world but um in
these studies that was controlled um and

3664
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:33,120
these studies that was controlled um and
 

3665
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,910
these studies that was controlled um and
only somewhere between TW depending on

3666
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:34,920
only somewhere between TW depending on
 

3667
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:36,870
only somewhere between TW depending on
the study between 20 and 40% of people

3668
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:36,880
the study between 20 and 40% of people
 

3669
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:39,790
the study between 20 and 40% of people
became infected with a disease so

3670
01:19:39,790 --> 01:19:39,800
became infected with a disease so
 

3671
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,790
became infected with a disease so
exposure to a virus doesn't mean de

3672
01:19:42,790 --> 01:19:42,800
exposure to a virus doesn't mean de
 

3673
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,870
exposure to a virus doesn't mean de
facto that you will um develop an

3674
01:19:45,870 --> 01:19:45,880
facto that you will um develop an
 

3675
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:47,910
facto that you will um develop an
illness you will be a carrier and you

3676
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:47,920
illness you will be a carrier and you
 

3677
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:50,189
illness you will be a carrier and you
will spread the virus to other people

3678
01:19:50,189 --> 01:19:50,199
will spread the virus to other people
 

3679
01:19:50,199 --> 01:19:52,830
will spread the virus to other people
but you yourself may not uh you're

3680
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:52,840
but you yourself may not uh you're
 

3681
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:56,350
but you yourself may not uh you're
immune system may be um in a state that

3682
01:19:56,350 --> 01:19:56,360
immune system may be um in a state that
 

3683
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:59,189
immune system may be um in a state that
um you you can make enough antibodies to

3684
01:19:59,189 --> 01:19:59,199
um you you can make enough antibodies to
 

3685
01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:03,270
um you you can make enough antibodies to
um not uh not show symptoms not develop

3686
01:20:03,270 --> 01:20:03,280
um not uh not show symptoms not develop
 

3687
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:07,669
um not uh not show symptoms not develop
symptoms um and so um of course what

3688
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:07,679
symptoms um and so um of course what
 

3689
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:10,350
symptoms um and so um of course what
this means is again is that you know

3690
01:20:10,350 --> 01:20:10,360
this means is again is that you know
 

3691
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:12,430
this means is again is that you know
like if I asked you do you think you

3692
01:20:12,430 --> 01:20:12,440
like if I asked you do you think you
 

3693
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:15,990
like if I asked you do you think you
know a virus is the cause of ill of of a

3694
01:20:15,990 --> 01:20:16,000
know a virus is the cause of ill of of a
 

3695
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,470
know a virus is the cause of ill of of a
common cold or you know most people if I

3696
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:18,480
common cold or you know most people if I
 

3697
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,390
common cold or you know most people if I
ask this question I can tell you because

3698
01:20:20,390 --> 01:20:20,400
ask this question I can tell you because
 

3699
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,550
ask this question I can tell you because
I I I ask this question so do you think

3700
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:22,560
I I I ask this question so do you think
 

3701
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:25,950
I I I ask this question so do you think
of virus is the cause of a cold most

3702
01:20:25,950 --> 01:20:25,960
of virus is the cause of a cold most
 

3703
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:27,790
of virus is the cause of a cold most
people would say yes I think it is and

3704
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:27,800
people would say yes I think it is and
 

3705
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:29,870
people would say yes I think it is and
then I say yeah well only 20 to 40% of

3706
01:20:29,870 --> 01:20:29,880
then I say yeah well only 20 to 40% of
 

3707
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:32,910
then I say yeah well only 20 to 40% of
people develop respiratory illness in

3708
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:32,920
people develop respiratory illness in
 

3709
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:36,430
people develop respiratory illness in
exposure to a virus so clearly it is a

3710
01:20:36,430 --> 01:20:36,440
exposure to a virus so clearly it is a
 

3711
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,390
exposure to a virus so clearly it is a
necessary cause but it's not a

3712
01:20:38,390 --> 01:20:38,400
necessary cause but it's not a
 

3713
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,189
necessary cause but it's not a
sufficient cause and there are other

3714
01:20:40,189 --> 01:20:40,199
sufficient cause and there are other
 

3715
01:20:40,199 --> 01:20:42,669
sufficient cause and there are other
causes again so not simple single causes

3716
01:20:42,669 --> 01:20:42,679
causes again so not simple single causes
 

3717
01:20:42,679 --> 01:20:45,750
causes again so not simple single causes

3721
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,910

so the answer is no but let me sort of

3810
01:22:46,910 --> 01:22:46,920
so the answer is no but let me sort of
 

3811
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:50,510
so the answer is no but let me sort of
push back but so your intuition is very

3812
01:22:50,510 --> 01:22:50,520
push back but so your intuition is very
 

3813
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:52,669
push back but so your intuition is very
strong here not your intuition the way

describe this but is it possible there's

describe this but is it possible there's
 

3817
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:58,950
describe this but is it possible there's
a direction to this Evolution like do

3818
01:22:58,950 --> 01:22:58,960
a direction to this Evolution like do
 

3819
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:00,910
a direction to this Evolution like do
you think of this Evolution as having a

you think of this Evolution as having a
 

3821
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:03,629
you think of this Evolution as having a

01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,270
there a sense in which even though in

smarter I thought it doesn't there's no
 

3865
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,270
smarter I thought it doesn't there's no
I thought there's no smarter no I didn't

3866
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:05,280
I thought there's no smarter no I didn't
 

3867
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:06,709
I thought there's no smarter no I didn't
say there's no smarter I said there's no

3868
01:24:06,709 --> 01:24:06,719
say there's no smarter I said there's no
 

3869
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:09,669
say there's no smarter I said there's no
Direction okay so I think the thing to

3870
01:24:09,669 --> 01:24:09,679
Direction okay so I think the thing to
 

3871
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:12,030
Direction okay so I think the thing to
say or or what I understand to be the

3872
01:24:12,030 --> 01:24:12,040
say or or what I understand to be the
 

3873
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:15,390
say or or what I understand to be the
case is that um there's variation it's

3874
01:24:15,390 --> 01:24:15,400
case is that um there's variation it's
 

3875
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:17,830
case is that um there's variation it's
not unbounded variation and there are

3876
01:24:17,830 --> 01:24:17,840
not unbounded variation and there are
 

3877
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:20,350
not unbounded variation and there are
selectors there are there are there are

3878
01:24:20,350 --> 01:24:20,360
selectors there are there are there are
 

3879
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:24,110
selectors there are there are there are
pressures that we select and so not

3880
01:24:24,110 --> 01:24:24,120
pressures that we select and so not
 

3881
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:26,030
pressures that we select and so not
anything is possible because we live on

3882
01:24:26,030 --> 01:24:26,040
anything is possible because we live on
 

3883
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:28,310
anything is possible because we live on
a planet that has certain physical

3884
01:24:28,310 --> 01:24:28,320
a planet that has certain physical
 

3885
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:31,550
a planet that has certain physical
realities to it right um and but those

3886
01:24:31,550 --> 01:24:31,560
realities to it right um and but those
 

3887
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:34,149
realities to it right um and but those
physical realities are what

3888
01:24:34,149 --> 01:24:34,159
physical realities are what
 

3889
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:36,550
physical realities are what
constrain the

3890
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:36,560
constrain the
 

3891
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:39,510
constrain the
possibilities um the physical realities

3892
01:24:39,510 --> 01:24:39,520
possibilities um the physical realities
 

3893
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:41,990
possibilities um the physical realities
of our genes and the physical realities

3894
01:24:41,990 --> 01:24:42,000
of our genes and the physical realities
 

3895
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,910

3899
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:53,270

on on this planet so what I would say is

3900
01:24:53,270 --> 01:24:53,280
on on this planet so what I would say is
 

3901
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:56,149
on on this planet so what I would say is
that um there's no

3902
01:24:56,149 --> 01:24:56,159
that um there's no
 

3903
01:24:56,159 --> 01:24:58,430
that um there's no

01:24:58,430 --> 01:24:58,440
Direction um
 

3905
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:02,830
Direction um
but uh there is not it's not infinite

3906
01:25:02,830 --> 01:25:02,840
but uh there is not it's not infinite
 

3907
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:05,990
but uh there is not it's not infinite

01:25:10,830 --> 01:25:10,840
statistical regularities in it and some
 

3913
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:13,390
statistical regularities in it and some
things will never happen and so though

3914
01:25:13,390 --> 01:25:13,400
things will never happen and so though
 

3915
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:16,030
things will never happen and so though
all of those things are are interacting

3916
01:25:16,030 --> 01:25:16,040
all of those things are are interacting
 

3917
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:17,750
all of those things are are interacting
with

3918
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:17,760
with
 

3919
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:21,470
with
um uh with our genes and so on and our

01:25:21,470 --> 01:25:21,480
um uh with our genes and so on and our
 

3921
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:22,870
um uh with our genes and so on and our
you know the physical nature of our

3922
01:25:22,870 --> 01:25:22,880
you know the physical nature of our
 

3923
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,310
you know the physical nature of our
bodies to make some things more possible

3924
01:25:25,310 --> 01:25:25,320
bodies to make some things more possible
 

3925
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,030
bodies to make some things more possible
and some things less possible look I

3926
01:25:27,030 --> 01:25:27,040
and some things less possible look I
 

3927
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:29,390
and some things less possible look I
mean humans have very complex brains but

3928
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:29,400
mean humans have very complex brains but
 

3929
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:32,189
mean humans have very complex brains but
birds have complex brains and so do uh

3930
01:25:32,189 --> 01:25:32,199
birds have complex brains and so do uh
 

3931
01:25:32,199 --> 01:25:36,390
birds have complex brains and so do uh
you know um so do uh octopuses have very

3932
01:25:36,390 --> 01:25:36,400
you know um so do uh octopuses have very
 

3933
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:39,270
you know um so do uh octopuses have very
complex brains and all three sets of all

3934
01:25:39,270 --> 01:25:39,280
complex brains and all three sets of all
 

3935
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,709
complex brains and all three sets of all
three of those brains are are are

3936
01:25:41,709 --> 01:25:41,719
three of those brains are are are
 

3937
01:25:41,719 --> 01:25:43,629
three of those brains are are are
somewhat different from one another you

3938
01:25:43,629 --> 01:25:43,639
somewhat different from one another you
 

3939
01:25:43,639 --> 01:25:46,510
somewhat different from one another you
know uh bird Birds some birds have very

3940
01:25:46,510 --> 01:25:46,520
know uh bird Birds some birds have very
 

3941
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:47,709
know uh bird Birds some birds have very
complex brains some even have

3942
01:25:47,709 --> 01:25:47,719
complex brains some even have
 

3943
01:25:47,719 --> 01:25:49,070
complex brains some even have
rudimentary language they have no

3944
01:25:49,070 --> 01:25:49,080
rudimentary language they have no
 

3945
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:50,030
rudimentary language they have no
cerebral

3946
01:25:50,030 --> 01:25:50,040
cerebral
 

3947
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:53,070
cerebral
cortex I mean they admittedly they have

3948
01:25:53,070 --> 01:25:53,080
cortex I mean they admittedly they have
 

3949
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:54,990
cortex I mean they admittedly they have
this is um now lesson two right they

3950
01:25:54,990 --> 01:25:55,000
this is um now lesson two right they
 

3951
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,590
this is um now lesson two right they
have is it lesson two or lesson one let

3952
01:25:56,590 --> 01:25:56,600
have is it lesson two or lesson one let
 

3953
01:25:56,600 --> 01:26:00,470
have is it lesson two or lesson one let
me think no this is lesson one they have

3954
01:26:00,470 --> 01:26:00,480
me think no this is lesson one they have
 

3955
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:01,990
me think no this is lesson one they have
um

3956
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:02,000
um
 

3957
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,669
um
uh they have the same neurons the same

3958
01:26:05,669 --> 01:26:05,679
uh they have the same neurons the same
 

3959
01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:07,870
uh they have the same neurons the same
neurons that that in a human become the

3960
01:26:07,870 --> 01:26:07,880
neurons that that in a human become the
 

3961
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:10,950
neurons that that in a human become the
cerebral cortex birds have those neurons

3962
01:26:10,950 --> 01:26:10,960
cerebral cortex birds have those neurons
 

3963
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:12,470
cerebral cortex birds have those neurons
they just don't form themselves into a

3964
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:12,480
they just don't form themselves into a
 

3965
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,590
they just don't form themselves into a
cerebral cortex but I mean crows for

3966
01:26:14,590 --> 01:26:14,600
cerebral cortex but I mean crows for
 

3967
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:17,189
cerebral cortex but I mean crows for
example are very sophisticated animals

3968
01:26:17,189 --> 01:26:17,199
example are very sophisticated animals
 

3969
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:18,950
example are very sophisticated animals
they can do a lot of the things that

3970
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:18,960
they can do a lot of the things that
 

3971
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:21,229
they can do a lot of the things that
humans can do in fact all of the things

3972
01:26:21,229 --> 01:26:21,239
humans can do in fact all of the things
 

3973
01:26:21,239 --> 01:26:23,350
humans can do in fact all of the things
that humans do that are very special

3974
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:23,360
that humans do that are very special
 

3975
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:25,470
that humans do that are very special
that seem very special there's at least

3976
01:26:25,470 --> 01:26:25,480
that seem very special there's at least
 

3977
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:27,189
that seem very special there's at least
one other animal on the planet that can

3978
01:26:27,189 --> 01:26:27,199
one other animal on the planet that can
 

3979
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:29,830
one other animal on the planet that can
do those things too what's special about

3980
01:26:29,830 --> 01:26:29,840
do those things too what's special about
 

3981
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,950
do those things too what's special about
the human brain is that we put them all

3982
01:26:32,950 --> 01:26:32,960
the human brain is that we put them all
 

3983
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:35,870
the human brain is that we put them all
together so we learn from one another we

3984
01:26:35,870 --> 01:26:35,880
together so we learn from one another we
 

3985
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:37,030
together so we learn from one another we
don't have to experience everything

3986
01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:37,040
don't have to experience everything
 

3987
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:39,790
don't have to experience everything
ourselves we can watch another animal or

3988
01:26:39,790 --> 01:26:39,800
ourselves we can watch another animal or
 

3989
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:41,590
ourselves we can watch another animal or
another Human Experience something and

3990
01:26:41,590 --> 01:26:41,600
another Human Experience something and
 

3991
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,149
another Human Experience something and
we can learn from that well there are

3992
01:26:43,149 --> 01:26:43,159
we can learn from that well there are
 

3993
01:26:43,159 --> 01:26:44,709
we can learn from that well there are
many other animals who can learn by

3994
01:26:44,709 --> 01:26:44,719
many other animals who can learn by
 

3995
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:46,990
many other animals who can learn by
copying yeah that we communicate with

3996
01:26:46,990 --> 01:26:47,000
copying yeah that we communicate with
 

3997
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,870
copying yeah that we communicate with
each other very very efficiently we have

3998
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:48,880
each other very very efficiently we have
 

3999
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,950
each other very very efficiently we have
language but we're not the only animals

4000
01:26:50,950 --> 01:26:50,960
language but we're not the only animals
 

4001
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,310
language but we're not the only animals
who are efficiently efficient

4002
01:26:52,310 --> 01:26:52,320
who are efficiently efficient
 

4003
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:53,830
who are efficiently efficient
communicators there are lots of other

4004
01:26:53,830 --> 01:26:53,840
communicators there are lots of other
 

4005
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,709
communicators there are lots of other
animals who can efficiently communicate

4006
01:26:55,709 --> 01:26:55,719
animals who can efficiently communicate
 

4007
01:26:55,719 --> 01:26:58,590
animals who can efficiently communicate
like bees for example um you know we

4008
01:26:58,590 --> 01:26:58,600
like bees for example um you know we
 

4009
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:00,470
like bees for example um you know we
cooperate really well with one another

4010
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:00,480
cooperate really well with one another
 

4011
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:02,229
cooperate really well with one another
to do Grand things but there are other

4012
01:27:02,229 --> 01:27:02,239
to do Grand things but there are other
 

4013
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:04,750
to do Grand things but there are other
animals that cooperate too and so every

4014
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:04,760
animals that cooperate too and so every
 

4015
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:06,750
animals that cooperate too and so every
Innovation that we have other animals

4016
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:06,760
Innovation that we have other animals
 

4017
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:09,990
Innovation that we have other animals
have too what we have is we have all of

4018
01:27:09,990 --> 01:27:10,000
have too what we have is we have all of
 

4019
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,990
have too what we have is we have all of
those together interwoven in this very

4020
01:27:12,990 --> 01:27:13,000
those together interwoven in this very
 

4021
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:18,590
those together interwoven in this very
complex dance in a brain that is not

4022
01:27:18,590 --> 01:27:18,600
complex dance in a brain that is not
 

4023
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:24,030
complex dance in a brain that is not
unique exactly but that is you know it

4024
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:24,040
unique exactly but that is you know it
 

4025
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:27,709
unique exactly but that is you know it
does have some features that make it use

4026
01:27:27,709 --> 01:27:27,719
does have some features that make it use
 

4027
01:27:27,719 --> 01:27:30,430
does have some features that make it use
that make it particularly useful for us

4028
01:27:30,430 --> 01:27:30,440
that make it particularly useful for us
 

4029
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:33,550
that make it particularly useful for us
um to do all of these things uh you know

4030
01:27:33,550 --> 01:27:33,560
um to do all of these things uh you know
 

4031
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:35,870
um to do all of these things uh you know
to have all of these things intertwined

4032
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:35,880
to have all of these things intertwined
 

4033
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:39,470
to have all of these things intertwined
so you know our brains are actually the

4034
01:27:39,470 --> 01:27:39,480
so you know our brains are actually the
 

4035
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:42,550
so you know our brains are actually the
last time we talked I I I made a mistake

4036
01:27:42,550 --> 01:27:42,560
last time we talked I I I made a mistake
 

4037
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:45,910
last time we talked I I I made a mistake
because I said um in my enthusiasm I

4038
01:27:45,910 --> 01:27:45,920
because I said um in my enthusiasm I
 

4039
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:49,109
because I said um in my enthusiasm I
said you know our brains are are not

4040
01:27:49,109 --> 01:27:49,119
said you know our brains are are not
 

4041
01:27:49,119 --> 01:27:51,629
said you know our brains are are not
larger are relative to our bodies our

4042
01:27:51,629 --> 01:27:51,639
larger are relative to our bodies our
 

4043
01:27:51,639 --> 01:27:54,990
larger are relative to our bodies our
brains are not larger um than um than

4044
01:27:54,990 --> 01:27:55,000
brains are not larger um than um than
 

4045
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,510
brains are not larger um than um than
other primates and that's actually not

4046
01:27:56,510 --> 01:27:56,520
other primates and that's actually not
 

4047
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:59,070
other primates and that's actually not
true actually our our brains relative to

4048
01:27:59,070 --> 01:27:59,080
true actually our our brains relative to
 

4049
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:02,270
true actually our our brains relative to
our body size is somewhat larger so yeah

4050
01:28:02,270 --> 01:28:02,280
our body size is somewhat larger so yeah
 

4051
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:04,950
our body size is somewhat larger so yeah
an ape who's not a human that's not a

4052
01:28:04,950 --> 01:28:04,960
an ape who's not a human that's not a
 

4053
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:08,470
an ape who's not a human that's not a
human um their brains are larger than

4054
01:28:08,470 --> 01:28:08,480
human um their brains are larger than
 

4055
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:11,709
human um their brains are larger than
their body sizes than say relative to

4056
01:28:11,709 --> 01:28:11,719
their body sizes than say relative to
 

4057
01:28:11,719 --> 01:28:13,990
their body sizes than say relative to
like a smaller monkey and a human's

4058
01:28:13,990 --> 01:28:14,000
like a smaller monkey and a human's
 

4059
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,950
like a smaller monkey and a human's
brain is larger relative to its body

4060
01:28:16,950 --> 01:28:16,960
brain is larger relative to its body
 

4061
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:18,669
brain is larger relative to its body
size than a than a gorilla that's a good

4062
01:28:18,669 --> 01:28:18,679
size than a than a gorilla that's a good
 

4063
01:28:18,679 --> 01:28:22,070
size than a than a gorilla that's a good
approximation of your um of whatever of

4064
01:28:22,070 --> 01:28:22,080
approximation of your um of whatever of
 

4065
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:23,910
approximation of your um of whatever of
of the bunch of stuff you that you can

4066
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:23,920
of the bunch of stuff you that you can
 

4067
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:26,270
of the bunch of stuff you that you can
shove in there well what I was going to

4068
01:28:26,270 --> 01:28:26,280
shove in there well what I was going to
 

4069
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:28,470
shove in there well what I was going to
say is but our cerebral cortex is not

4070
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:28,480
say is but our cerebral cortex is not
 

4071
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:30,550
say is but our cerebral cortex is not
larger than what you would expect for a

4072
01:28:30,550 --> 01:28:30,560
larger than what you would expect for a
 

4073
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:34,629
larger than what you would expect for a
brain of our of of of of its size so so

4074
01:28:34,629 --> 01:28:34,639
brain of our of of of of its size so so
 

4075
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:37,149
brain of our of of of of its size so so
relative to say an ape like a like a

4076
01:28:37,149 --> 01:28:37,159
relative to say an ape like a like a
 

4077
01:28:37,159 --> 01:28:40,629
relative to say an ape like a like a
gorilla or a chimp or even a mammal like

4078
01:28:40,629 --> 01:28:40,639
gorilla or a chimp or even a mammal like
 

4079
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:46,350
gorilla or a chimp or even a mammal like
a dolphin or an elephant um you know our

4080
01:28:46,350 --> 01:28:46,360
a dolphin or an elephant um you know our
 

4081
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:49,790
a dolphin or an elephant um you know our
brains our our cerebral cortex is as

4082
01:28:49,790 --> 01:28:49,800
brains our our cerebral cortex is as
 

4083
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:52,030
brains our our cerebral cortex is as
large as you would expect it to be for a

4084
01:28:52,030 --> 01:28:52,040
large as you would expect it to be for a
 

4085
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:55,149
large as you would expect it to be for a
brain of our size so there's nothing

4086
01:28:55,149 --> 01:28:55,159
brain of our size so there's nothing
 

4087
01:28:55,159 --> 01:28:57,990
brain of our size so there's nothing
special about our cerebral cortex and

4088
01:28:57,990 --> 01:28:58,000
special about our cerebral cortex and
 

4089
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,149
special about our cerebral cortex and
this is something I explain in the book

4090
01:29:00,149 --> 01:29:00,159
this is something I explain in the book
 

4091
01:29:00,159 --> 01:29:02,910
this is something I explain in the book
where I I say okay you know like by

4092
01:29:02,910 --> 01:29:02,920
where I I say okay you know like by
 

4093
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:05,229
where I I say okay you know like by
analogy um if you walk into somebody's

4094
01:29:05,229 --> 01:29:05,239
analogy um if you walk into somebody's
 

4095
01:29:05,239 --> 01:29:07,390
analogy um if you walk into somebody's
house and you see that they have a huge

4096
01:29:07,390 --> 01:29:07,400
house and you see that they have a huge
 

4097
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:09,669
house and you see that they have a huge
kitchen you know you might think well

4098
01:29:09,669 --> 01:29:09,679
kitchen you know you might think well
 

4099
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:11,669
kitchen you know you might think well
maybe you know maybe this is a place I

4100
01:29:11,669 --> 01:29:11,679
maybe you know maybe this is a place I
 

4101
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:13,709
maybe you know maybe this is a place I
really definitely want to eat dinner at

4102
01:29:13,709 --> 01:29:13,719
really definitely want to eat dinner at
 

4103
01:29:13,719 --> 01:29:15,270
really definitely want to eat dinner at
because you know these people must be

4104
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:15,280
because you know these people must be
 

4105
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:17,070
because you know these people must be
Gourmet Cooks but you don't know

4106
01:29:17,070 --> 01:29:17,080
Gourmet Cooks but you don't know
 

4107
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:18,430
Gourmet Cooks but you don't know
anything about what the size of their

4108
01:29:18,430 --> 01:29:18,440
anything about what the size of their
 

4109
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:20,350
anything about what the size of their
kitchen means unless you consider it in

4110
01:29:20,350 --> 01:29:20,360
kitchen means unless you consider it in
 

4111
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:21,669
kitchen means unless you consider it in
relation to the size of the rest of the

4112
01:29:21,669 --> 01:29:21,679
relation to the size of the rest of the
 

4113
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:23,070
relation to the size of the rest of the
house

4114
01:29:23,070 --> 01:29:23,080
house
 

4115
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:24,590
house
if it's a if it's a big kitchen in a

4116
01:29:24,590 --> 01:29:24,600
if it's a if it's a big kitchen in a
 

4117
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:25,669
if it's a if it's a big kitchen in a
really big

4118
01:29:25,669 --> 01:29:25,679
really big
 

4119
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:28,229
really big
house it's not telling you anything

4120
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:28,239
house it's not telling you anything
 

4121
01:29:28,239 --> 01:29:30,390
house it's not telling you anything
special right if it's a big kitchen in a

4122
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:30,400
special right if it's a big kitchen in a
 

4123
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,910
special right if it's a big kitchen in a
small house then that might be a place

4124
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:32,920
small house then that might be a place
 

4125
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:34,350
small house then that might be a place
that you want to eat for you want to

4126
01:29:34,350 --> 01:29:34,360
that you want to eat for you want to
 

4127
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:36,709
that you want to eat for you want to
stay for dinner because it's more likely

4128
01:29:36,709 --> 01:29:36,719
stay for dinner because it's more likely
 

4129
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:38,430
stay for dinner because it's more likely
that that kitchen is large for a special

4130
01:29:38,430 --> 01:29:38,440
that that kitchen is large for a special
 

4131
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:42,350
that that kitchen is large for a special
reason and so the cerebral cortex of a

4132
01:29:42,350 --> 01:29:42,360
reason and so the cerebral cortex of a
 

4133
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:46,189
reason and so the cerebral cortex of a
human brain isn't in and of itself

4134
01:29:46,189 --> 01:29:46,199
human brain isn't in and of itself
 

4135
01:29:46,199 --> 01:29:49,430
human brain isn't in and of itself
special because of its size

4136
01:29:49,430 --> 01:29:49,440
special because of its size
 

4137
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:52,510
special because of its size
however there are some

4138
01:29:52,510 --> 01:29:52,520
however there are some
 

4139
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:54,709
however there are some
genetic changes that have happened in

4140
01:29:54,709 --> 01:29:54,719
genetic changes that have happened in
 

4141
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:55,790
genetic changes that have happened in
the human

4142
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:55,800
the human
 

4143
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:58,430
the human

01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:01,600
grown with to whatever size is you know
 

4147
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,709

typical for for the whole brain size
 

4149
01:30:03,719 --> 01:30:06,070
typical for for the whole brain size
right there are some changes that do

4150
01:30:06,070 --> 01:30:06,080
right there are some changes that do
 

4151
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:10,229
right there are some changes that do
give the human brain slightly more of

4152
01:30:10,229 --> 01:30:10,239
give the human brain slightly more of
 

4153
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:13,550
give the human brain slightly more of
some capacities they're not special but

4154
01:30:13,550 --> 01:30:13,560
some capacities they're not special but
 

4155
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:16,070
some capacities they're not special but
there's just they just you know we can

4156
01:30:16,070 --> 01:30:16,080
there's just they just you know we can
 

4157
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:17,790
there's just they just you know we can
do some

4158
01:30:17,790 --> 01:30:17,800
do some
 

4159
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:21,590
do some
things much better than other animals

4160
01:30:21,590 --> 01:30:21,600
things much better than other animals
 

4161
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,030
things much better than other animals
and you know correspondingly other

4162
01:30:23,030 --> 01:30:23,040
and you know correspondingly other
 

4163
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,149
and you know correspondingly other
animals can do some things much better

4164
01:30:25,149 --> 01:30:25,159
animals can do some things much better
 

4165
01:30:25,159 --> 01:30:27,070
animals can do some things much better
than we can we can't grow back limbs we

4166
01:30:27,070 --> 01:30:27,080
than we can we can't grow back limbs we
 

4167
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:28,950
than we can we can't grow back limbs we
can't lift 50 times our own body weight

4168
01:30:28,950 --> 01:30:28,960
can't lift 50 times our own body weight
 

4169
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:30,629
can't lift 50 times our own body weight
well I mean maybe you can but I can't

4170
01:30:30,629 --> 01:30:30,639
well I mean maybe you can but I can't
 

4171
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:32,830
well I mean maybe you can but I can't
live 50 times body ants with that regard

4172
01:30:32,830 --> 01:30:32,840
live 50 times body ants with that regard
 

4173
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:34,550
live 50 times body ants with that regard
are very impressive and then you're

4174
01:30:34,550 --> 01:30:34,560
are very impressive and then you're
 

4175
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,910
are very impressive and then you're
saying with the with the frontal cortex

4176
01:30:36,910 --> 01:30:36,920
saying with the with the frontal cortex
 

4177
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:39,550
saying with the with the frontal cortex
like that's the size is not always the

4178
01:30:39,550 --> 01:30:39,560
like that's the size is not always the
 

4179
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:43,310
like that's the size is not always the
right uh measure of uh capability I

4180
01:30:43,310 --> 01:30:43,320
right uh measure of uh capability I
 

4181
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:47,030
right uh measure of uh capability I
guess so size isn't everything size

4182
01:30:47,030 --> 01:30:47,040
guess so size isn't everything size
 

4183
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,790
guess so size isn't everything size
isn't everything that's a quot you know

4184
01:30:49,790 --> 01:30:49,800
isn't everything that's a quot you know
 

4185
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:51,350
isn't everything that's a quot you know
people like it when I disagree so let me

4186
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:51,360
people like it when I disagree so let me
 

4187
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:53,709
people like it when I disagree so let me
disagree with with you uh on something

4188
01:30:53,709 --> 01:30:53,719
disagree with with you uh on something
 

4189
01:30:53,719 --> 01:30:55,910
disagree with with you uh on something
or just like play Devil's adoc a little

4190
01:30:55,910 --> 01:30:55,920
or just like play Devil's adoc a little
 

4191
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:58,270
or just like play Devil's adoc a little
bit so you've uh painted a really nice

4192
01:30:58,270 --> 01:30:58,280
bit so you've uh painted a really nice
 

4193
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:01,470
bit so you've uh painted a really nice
picture that Evolution doesn't have a

4194
01:31:01,470 --> 01:31:01,480
picture that Evolution doesn't have a
 

4195
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:04,430
picture that Evolution doesn't have a
Direction but is it possible if we just

4196
01:31:04,430 --> 01:31:04,440
Direction but is it possible if we just
 

4197
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:06,990
Direction but is it possible if we just
ran Earth over and over again like this

4198
01:31:06,990 --> 01:31:07,000
ran Earth over and over again like this
 

4199
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,470
ran Earth over and over again like this
video game that the final result will be

4200
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:10,480
video game that the final result will be
 

4201
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:14,350
video game that the final result will be
the same so in the sense that we're

4202
01:31:14,350 --> 01:31:14,360
the same so in the sense that we're
 

4203
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:17,430
the same so in the sense that we're
eventually there'll be an AGI type HAL

4204
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:17,440
eventually there'll be an AGI type HAL
 

4205
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:19,910
eventually there'll be an AGI type HAL
9000 type system that just like flies

4206
01:31:19,910 --> 01:31:19,920
9000 type system that just like flies
 

4207
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:24,350
9000 type system that just like flies
and colonizes nearby by uh earthlike

4208
01:31:24,350 --> 01:31:24,360
and colonizes nearby by uh earthlike
 

4209
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:26,950
and colonizes nearby by uh earthlike
planets and it's always will be the same

4210
01:31:26,950 --> 01:31:26,960
planets and it's always will be the same
 

4211
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:29,189
planets and it's always will be the same
and and the different organisms and the

4212
01:31:29,189 --> 01:31:29,199
and and the different organisms and the
 

4213
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:31,950
and and the different organisms and the
different evolution of the brain uh like

4214
01:31:31,950 --> 01:31:31,960
different evolution of the brain uh like
 

4215
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:34,189
different evolution of the brain uh like
it it doesn't feel like it has like a

4216
01:31:34,189 --> 01:31:34,199
it it doesn't feel like it has like a
 

4217
01:31:34,199 --> 01:31:37,870
it it doesn't feel like it has like a
Direction but given the constraints of

4218
01:31:37,870 --> 01:31:37,880
Direction but given the constraints of
 

4219
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:40,629
Direction but given the constraints of
Earth and whatever this imperative

4220
01:31:40,629 --> 01:31:40,639
Earth and whatever this imperative
 

4221
01:31:40,639 --> 01:31:42,350
Earth and whatever this imperative
whatever the hell is running this

4222
01:31:42,350 --> 01:31:42,360
whatever the hell is running this
 

4223
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:45,790
whatever the hell is running this
universe like it seems like it's running

4224
01:31:45,790 --> 01:31:45,800
universe like it seems like it's running
 

4225
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:48,669
universe like it seems like it's running
towards something is it possible that it

4226
01:31:48,669 --> 01:31:48,679
towards something is it possible that it
 

4227
01:31:48,679 --> 01:31:50,750
towards something is it possible that it
will always be the same thereby it will

4228
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:50,760
will always be the same thereby it will
 

4229
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:53,390
will always be the same thereby it will
be a Direction

4230
01:31:53,390 --> 01:31:53,400
be a Direction
 

4231
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:56,390
be a Direction
yeah I think you know as you know better

4232
01:31:56,390 --> 01:31:56,400
yeah I think you know as you know better
 

4233
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:58,470
yeah I think you know as you know better
than anyone else that that answer to

4234
01:31:58,470 --> 01:31:58,480
than anyone else that that answer to
 

4235
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,149
than anyone else that that answer to
that question is of course there's some

4236
01:32:00,149 --> 01:32:00,159
that question is of course there's some
 

4237
01:32:00,159 --> 01:32:02,870
that question is of course there's some
probability that that could happen right

4238
01:32:02,870 --> 01:32:02,880
probability that that could happen right
 

4239
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,750
probability that that could happen right
it's not a yes or no answer it's what's

4240
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:04,760
it's not a yes or no answer it's what's
 

4241
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:07,629
it's not a yes or no answer it's what's
the probability that that would happen

4242
01:32:07,629 --> 01:32:07,639
the probability that that would happen
 

4243
01:32:07,639 --> 01:32:13,990
the probability that that would happen
and there's a a whole um distribution of

4244
01:32:13,990 --> 01:32:14,000
and there's a a whole um distribution of
 

4245
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,350
and there's a a whole um distribution of
possibilities so maybe we end up what's

4246
01:32:16,350 --> 01:32:16,360
possibilities so maybe we end up what's
 

4247
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:18,109
possibilities so maybe we end up what's
the probability we end up with exactly

4248
01:32:18,109 --> 01:32:18,119
the probability we end up with exactly
 

4249
01:32:18,119 --> 01:32:21,669
the probability we end up with exactly
the same uh complement of creatures um

4250
01:32:21,669 --> 01:32:21,679
the same uh complement of creatures um
 

4251
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:23,550
the same uh complement of creatures um
including us what's the likelihood that

4252
01:32:23,550 --> 01:32:23,560
including us what's the likelihood that
 

4253
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:25,910
including us what's the likelihood that
we end up with you

4254
01:32:25,910 --> 01:32:25,920
we end up with you
 

4255
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:28,470
we end up with you
know creatures that are similar to

4256
01:32:28,470 --> 01:32:28,480
know creatures that are similar to
 

4257
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:31,350
know creatures that are similar to
humans that are but you know similar in

4258
01:32:31,350 --> 01:32:31,360
humans that are but you know similar in
 

4259
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,470
humans that are but you know similar in
in certain ways let's say but not

4260
01:32:33,470 --> 01:32:33,480
in certain ways let's say but not
 

4261
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:35,629
in certain ways let's say but not
exactly humans or you know all the way

4262
01:32:35,629 --> 01:32:35,639
exactly humans or you know all the way
 

4263
01:32:35,639 --> 01:32:39,229
exactly humans or you know all the way
to a completely different um

4264
01:32:39,229 --> 01:32:39,239
to a completely different um
 

4265
01:32:39,239 --> 01:32:41,750
to a completely different um
distribution of of creatures what's your

4266
01:32:41,750 --> 01:32:41,760
distribution of of creatures what's your
 

4267
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,870
distribution of of creatures what's your
intuition like if you were to bet money

4268
01:32:43,870 --> 01:32:43,880
intuition like if you were to bet money
 

4269
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:45,390
intuition like if you were to bet money
what does that distribution look like if

4270
01:32:45,390 --> 01:32:45,400
what does that distribution look like if
 

4271
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:47,109
what does that distribution look like if
we ran Earth over and over and over

4272
01:32:47,109 --> 01:32:47,119
we ran Earth over and over and over
 

4273
01:32:47,119 --> 01:32:49,709
we ran Earth over and over and over
again I would say given the um you're

4274
01:32:49,709 --> 01:32:49,719
again I would say given the um you're
 

4275
01:32:49,719 --> 01:32:51,750
again I would say given the um you're
now asking me questions that this is not

4276
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:51,760
now asking me questions that this is not
 

4277
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:53,510
now asking me questions that this is not
science this this is not science so but

4278
01:32:53,510 --> 01:32:53,520
science this this is not science so but
 

4279
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:54,990
science this this is not science so but
I would say okay well what's the

4280
01:32:54,990 --> 01:32:55,000
I would say okay well what's the
 

4281
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,910
I would say okay well what's the
probability that um it's going to be a

4282
01:32:56,910 --> 01:32:56,920
probability that um it's going to be a
 

4283
01:32:56,920 --> 01:33:00,669
probability that um it's going to be a
carbon life form Pro probably high yeah

4284
01:33:00,669 --> 01:33:00,679
carbon life form Pro probably high yeah
 

4285
01:33:00,679 --> 01:33:02,350
carbon life form Pro probably high yeah
but that's because I don't know anything

4286
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:02,360
but that's because I don't know anything
 

4287
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:04,990
but that's because I don't know anything
about Alternatives yeah you know I don't

4288
01:33:04,990 --> 01:33:05,000
about Alternatives yeah you know I don't
 

4289
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,709
about Alternatives yeah you know I don't
I'm not I'm not really well versed in

4290
01:33:06,709 --> 01:33:06,719
I'm not I'm not really well versed in
 

4291
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:09,109
I'm not I'm not really well versed in
that um what's the probability that you

4292
01:33:09,109 --> 01:33:09,119
that um what's the probability that you
 

4293
01:33:09,119 --> 01:33:11,070
that um what's the probability that you
know so what's the probability that the

4294
01:33:11,070 --> 01:33:11,080
know so what's the probability that the
 

4295
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:13,229
know so what's the probability that the
animals will begin in the ocean and

4296
01:33:13,229 --> 01:33:13,239
animals will begin in the ocean and
 

4297
01:33:13,239 --> 01:33:15,430
animals will begin in the ocean and
crawl out onto Land versus the other way

4298
01:33:15,430 --> 01:33:15,440
crawl out onto Land versus the other way
 

4299
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:18,229
crawl out onto Land versus the other way
versus I would say probably

4300
01:33:18,229 --> 01:33:18,239
versus I would say probably
 

4301
01:33:18,239 --> 01:33:21,229
versus I would say probably
high I don't know but you know but do I

4302
01:33:21,229 --> 01:33:21,239
high I don't know but you know but do I
 

4303
01:33:21,239 --> 01:33:22,910
high I don't know but you know but do I
think what's the likelihood that we

4304
01:33:22,910 --> 01:33:22,920
think what's the likelihood that we
 

4305
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:25,310
think what's the likelihood that we
would end up with exactly the same or

4306
01:33:25,310 --> 01:33:25,320
would end up with exactly the same or
 

4307
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:29,030
would end up with exactly the same or
very similar I think it's low actually I

4308
01:33:29,030 --> 01:33:29,040
very similar I think it's low actually I
 

4309
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,270
very similar I think it's low actually I
I wouldn't say it's low but I I would

4310
01:33:30,270 --> 01:33:30,280
I wouldn't say it's low but I I would
 

4311
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:32,430
I wouldn't say it's low but I I would
say it's not it's not 100% and I'm not

4312
01:33:32,430 --> 01:33:32,440
say it's not it's not 100% and I'm not
 

4313
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:33,470
say it's not it's not 100% and I'm not
even sure it's

4314
01:33:33,470 --> 01:33:33,480
even sure it's
 

4315
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:37,350
even sure it's
50% you know I would say I I don't think

4316
01:33:37,350 --> 01:33:37,360
50% you know I would say I I don't think
 

4317
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:39,350
50% you know I would say I I don't think
that we're here by accident because I

4318
01:33:39,350 --> 01:33:39,360
that we're here by accident because I
 

4319
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:41,750
that we're here by accident because I
think like I said there are constraints

4320
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:41,760
think like I said there are constraints
 

4321
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:43,550
think like I said there are constraints
like there are some physical constraints

4322
01:33:43,550 --> 01:33:43,560
like there are some physical constraints
 

4323
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:45,790
like there are some physical constraints
about Earth now of course if you were a

4324
01:33:45,790 --> 01:33:45,800
about Earth now of course if you were a
 

4325
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:48,149
about Earth now of course if you were a
cosmologist you could say well the the

4326
01:33:48,149 --> 01:33:48,159
cosmologist you could say well the the
 

4327
01:33:48,159 --> 01:33:49,950
cosmologist you could say well the the
fact that the Earth is if you were to do

4328
01:33:49,950 --> 01:33:49,960
fact that the Earth is if you were to do
 

4329
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:51,870
fact that the Earth is if you were to do
the big bang over again and keep doing

4330
01:33:51,870 --> 01:33:51,880
the big bang over again and keep doing
 

4331
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:53,189
the big bang over again and keep doing
it over and over and over again would

4332
01:33:53,189 --> 01:33:53,199
it over and over and over again would
 

4333
01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:56,270
it over and over and over again would
you still get the same solar systems

4334
01:33:56,270 --> 01:33:56,280
you still get the same solar systems
 

4335
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:58,270
you still get the same solar systems
would you still get the same planets

4336
01:33:58,270 --> 01:33:58,280
would you still get the same planets
 

4337
01:33:58,280 --> 01:33:59,990
would you still get the same planets
would you know would you still get the

01:33:59,990 --> 01:34:00,000
would you know would you still get the
 

4339
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,870
would you know would you still get the
same galaxies the same solar systems the

4340
01:34:01,870 --> 01:34:01,880
same galaxies the same solar systems the
 

4341
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:04,189
same galaxies the same solar systems the
same planets you know I don't know but

4342
01:34:04,189 --> 01:34:04,199
same planets you know I don't know but
 

4343
01:34:04,199 --> 01:34:07,109
same planets you know I don't know but
my guess is probably not um because

4344
01:34:07,109 --> 01:34:07,119
my guess is probably not um because
 

4345
01:34:07,119 --> 01:34:08,629
my guess is probably not um because
there are random things that happen that

4346
01:34:08,629 --> 01:34:08,639
there are random things that happen that
 

4347
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:12,070
there are random things that happen that
can again send things in one direct you

4348
01:34:12,070 --> 01:34:12,080
can again send things in one direct you
 

4349
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:14,070
can again send things in one direct you
know make one set of trajectories

4350
01:34:14,070 --> 01:34:14,080
know make one set of trajectories
 

4351
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:17,070
know make one set of trajectories
possible and another set impossible so

4352
01:34:17,070 --> 01:34:17,080
possible and another set impossible so
 

4353
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:21,870
possible and another set impossible so
um but I I guess my my my if I were

4354
01:34:21,870 --> 01:34:21,880
um but I I guess my my my if I were
 

4355
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:24,310
um but I I guess my my my if I were
going to bet bet something money or

4356
01:34:24,310 --> 01:34:24,320
going to bet bet something money or
 

4357
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:28,030
going to bet bet something money or
something valuable I would probably say

4358
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:28,040
something valuable I would probably say
 

4359
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:31,830
something valuable I would probably say
it's not zero and it's not 100% and it's

4360
01:34:31,830 --> 01:34:31,840
it's not zero and it's not 100% and it's
 

4361
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:33,830
it's not zero and it's not 100% and it's
probably not even 50% so there's some

4362
01:34:33,830 --> 01:34:33,840
probably not even 50% so there's some
 

4363
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,709
probably not even 50% so there's some
probability but it will be similar that

4364
01:34:35,709 --> 01:34:35,719
probability but it will be similar that
 

4365
01:34:35,719 --> 01:34:37,510
probability but it will be similar that
would be similar but I don't think I

4366
01:34:37,510 --> 01:34:37,520
would be similar but I don't think I
 

4367
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:40,070
would be similar but I don't think I
just think there are too many degrees of

01:34:40,070 --> 01:34:40,080
just think there are too many degrees of

01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:41,830
just think there are too many degrees of
freedom there are too many degrees of

Niche it does happen to be the case that
 

4391
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:16,629
Niche it does happen to be the case that
our Niche is large for any individual

01:35:16,629 --> 01:35:16,639
our Niche is large for any individual
 

4393
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:18,470
our Niche is large for any individual
human your Niche is whatever it is but

human your Niche is whatever it is but

01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:21,790
human your Niche is whatever it is but

01:35:25,390 --> 01:35:25,400
everywhere on the
 

4401
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:27,590
everywhere on the

01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:27,600
planet but not in the
 

4403
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,430
planet but not in the
ocean and actually other animals like

4404
01:35:30,430 --> 01:35:30,440
ocean and actually other animals like
 

4405
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:33,109

bacteria for example H have us beat

4406
01:35:33,109 --> 01:35:33,119

01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:37,270

miles you know hands down right so we're

4408
01:35:37,270 --> 01:35:37,280
miles you know hands down right so we're
 

4409
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:42,590
miles you know hands down right so we're
by any by any definition we're not

4410
01:35:42,590 --> 01:35:42,600
by any by any definition we're not
 

4411
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:45,669
by any by any definition we're not
special we're just you know adapted to

4412
01:35:45,669 --> 01:35:45,679
special we're just you know adapted to
 

4413
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:47,590
special we're just you know adapted to
our environment but bacteria don't have

4414
01:35:47,590 --> 01:35:47,600
our environment but bacteria don't have
 

4415
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:50,390
our environment but bacteria don't have
a podcast they're not exactly exactly

4416
01:35:50,390 --> 01:35:50,400
a podcast they're not exactly exactly
 

4417
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:53,350
a podcast they're not exactly exactly
and so that's the tension right so on

4418
01:35:53,350 --> 01:35:53,360
and so that's the tension right so on
 

4419
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:54,870
and so that's the tension right so on
the one hand you know we're not special

4420
01:35:54,870 --> 01:35:54,880
the one hand you know we're not special
 

4421
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,830
the one hand you know we're not special
animals we're just you know you know

4422
01:35:56,830 --> 01:35:56,840
animals we're just you know you know
 

4423
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:58,189
animals we're just you know you know
particularly well adapted to our Niche

4424
01:35:58,189 --> 01:35:58,199
particularly well adapted to our Niche
 

4425
01:35:58,199 --> 01:36:00,229
particularly well adapted to our Niche
on the other hand our Niche is huge and

4426
01:36:00,229 --> 01:36:00,239
on the other hand our Niche is huge and
 

4427
01:36:00,239 --> 01:36:02,350
on the other hand our Niche is huge and
we you know we don't just adapt to our

4428
01:36:02,350 --> 01:36:02,360
we you know we don't just adapt to our
 

4429
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:04,910
we you know we don't just adapt to our
environment we add to our environment we

4430
01:36:04,910 --> 01:36:04,920
environment we add to our environment we
 

4431
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:07,109
environment we add to our environment we
make stuff up give it a name and then it

4432
01:36:07,109 --> 01:36:07,119
make stuff up give it a name and then it
 

4433
01:36:07,119 --> 01:36:10,070
make stuff up give it a name and then it
becomes real and so no other animal can

4434
01:36:10,070 --> 01:36:10,080
becomes real and so no other animal can
 

4435
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:13,470
becomes real and so no other animal can
do that and so I think the the thing the

4436
01:36:13,470 --> 01:36:13,480
do that and so I think the the thing the
 

4437
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:14,790
do that and so I think the the thing the
way to think about it from my

4438
01:36:14,790 --> 01:36:14,800
way to think about it from my
 

4439
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:16,550
way to think about it from my
perspective or the way I made sense of

4440
01:36:16,550 --> 01:36:16,560
perspective or the way I made sense of
 

4441
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:19,830
perspective or the way I made sense of
it is to say you can look at any

4442
01:36:19,830 --> 01:36:19,840
it is to say you can look at any
 

4443
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:21,950
it is to say you can look at any
individual Single Character istic that a

human
 

4447
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:26,870
human
has that seems remarkable and you can

4448
01:36:26,870 --> 01:36:26,880
has that seems remarkable and you can
 

4449
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:30,229
has that seems remarkable and you can
find that in some other animal mhm what

4450
01:36:30,229 --> 01:36:30,239
find that in some other animal mhm what
 

4451
01:36:30,239 --> 01:36:34,350
find that in some other animal mhm what
you can't find in any other animal is

01:36:34,350 --> 01:36:34,360
you can't find in any other animal is

01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:37,310
you can't find in any other animal is

4483
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:18,149
of
that then you can start asking different

4484
01:37:18,149 --> 01:37:18,159
that then you can start asking different
 

4485
01:37:18,159 --> 01:37:21,629
that then you can start asking different
kinds of questions about what means to

4486
01:37:21,629 --> 01:37:21,639
kinds of questions about what means to
 

4487
01:37:21,639 --> 01:37:24,310
kinds of questions about what means to
be human and what kind of a human you

4488
01:37:24,310 --> 01:37:24,320
be human and what kind of a human you
 

4489
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:27,790
be human and what kind of a human you
want to be and what kind of a a world do

4490
01:37:27,790 --> 01:37:27,800
want to be and what kind of a a world do
 

4491
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:29,229
want to be and what kind of a a world do
you want to curate for the next

4492
01:37:29,229 --> 01:37:29,239
you want to curate for the next
 

4493
01:37:29,239 --> 01:37:32,270
you want to curate for the next
generation of humans so you I think

4494
01:37:32,270 --> 01:37:32,280
generation of humans so you I think
 

4495
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:34,629
generation of humans so you I think
that's the goal anyways right is just to

4496
01:37:34,629 --> 01:37:34,639
that's the goal anyways right is just to
 

4497
01:37:34,639 --> 01:37:37,030
that's the goal anyways right is just to
just to have a glimpse

4498
01:37:37,030 --> 01:37:37,040
just to have a glimpse
 

4499
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:40,189
just to have a glimpse
of instead of thinking about things in

4500
01:37:40,189 --> 01:37:40,199
of instead of thinking about things in
 

4501
01:37:40,199 --> 01:37:43,109
of instead of thinking about things in
in a simple linear way just have a

4502
01:37:43,109 --> 01:37:43,119
in a simple linear way just have a
 

4503
01:37:43,119 --> 01:37:44,870
in a simple linear way just have a
glimpse of the some of the things that

4504
01:37:44,870 --> 01:37:44,880
glimpse of the some of the things that
 

4505
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:47,030
glimpse of the some of the things that
matter that seemed that evidence

4506
01:37:47,030 --> 01:37:47,040
matter that seemed that evidence
 

4507
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:51,270
matter that seemed that evidence
suggests matters um to um the kind of

4508
01:37:51,270 --> 01:37:51,280
suggests matters um to um the kind of
 

4509
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:55,149
suggests matters um to um the kind of
brain in the kind of bodies that we have

4510
01:37:55,149 --> 01:37:55,159
brain in the kind of bodies that we have
 

4511
01:37:55,159 --> 01:37:57,229
brain in the kind of bodies that we have
um once you know that you can you can

4512
01:37:57,229 --> 01:37:57,239
um once you know that you can you can
 

4513
01:37:57,239 --> 01:37:59,310
um once you know that you can you can
work with it a little bit you're right

4514
01:37:59,310 --> 01:37:59,320
work with it a little bit you're right
 

4515
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:02,310
work with it a little bit you're right
words have power over your biology right

4516
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:02,320
words have power over your biology right
 

4517
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:05,390
words have power over your biology right
now I can text the words I love you from

4518
01:38:05,390 --> 01:38:05,400
now I can text the words I love you from
 

4519
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:07,430
now I can text the words I love you from
the United States to my close friend in

4520
01:38:07,430 --> 01:38:07,440
the United States to my close friend in
 

4521
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:09,830
the United States to my close friend in
Belgium and even though she cannot hear

4522
01:38:09,830 --> 01:38:09,840
Belgium and even though she cannot hear
 

4523
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:12,629
Belgium and even though she cannot hear
my voice or see my face I will change

4524
01:38:12,629 --> 01:38:12,639
my voice or see my face I will change
 

4525
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:15,589
my voice or see my face I will change
her heart rate her breathing and her

4526
01:38:15,589 --> 01:38:15,599
her heart rate her breathing and her
 

4527
01:38:15,599 --> 01:38:18,430
her heart rate her breathing and her
metabolism by the way beautifully

4528
01:38:18,430 --> 01:38:18,440
metabolism by the way beautifully
 

4529
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:20,790
metabolism by the way beautifully
written or someone could text something

4530
01:38:20,790 --> 01:38:20,800
written or someone could text something
 

4531
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,669
written or someone could text something
and be uous to you like is your door

4532
01:38:23,669 --> 01:38:23,679
and be uous to you like is your door
 

4533
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:26,350
and be uous to you like is your door
locked and odds are that it would affect

4534
01:38:26,350 --> 01:38:26,360
locked and odds are that it would affect
 

4535
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:29,589
locked and odds are that it would affect
your nervous system in an unpleasant way

4536
01:38:29,589 --> 01:38:29,599
your nervous system in an unpleasant way
 

4537
01:38:29,599 --> 01:38:32,510
your nervous system in an unpleasant way
so I mean there's a lot of stuff to talk

4538
01:38:32,510 --> 01:38:32,520
so I mean there's a lot of stuff to talk
 

4539
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:36,629
so I mean there's a lot of stuff to talk
about here but just one way to ask is

4540
01:38:36,629 --> 01:38:36,639
about here but just one way to ask is
 

4541
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:40,470
about here but just one way to ask is
um why do you think words have so much

4542
01:38:40,470 --> 01:38:40,480
um why do you think words have so much
 

4543
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:42,189
um why do you think words have so much
power over our

4544
01:38:42,189 --> 01:38:42,199
power over our
 

4545
01:38:42,199 --> 01:38:45,109
power over our
brain well I think we just have to look

4546
01:38:45,109 --> 01:38:45,119
brain well I think we just have to look
 

4547
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:47,350
brain well I think we just have to look
at the anatomy of the brain to answer

4548
01:38:47,350 --> 01:38:47,360
at the anatomy of the brain to answer
 

4549
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:48,790
at the anatomy of the brain to answer
that question

4550
01:38:48,790 --> 01:38:48,800
that question
 

4551
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:51,870
that question
so um if you look at the part parts of

4552
01:38:51,870 --> 01:38:51,880
so um if you look at the part parts of
 

4553
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:55,550
so um if you look at the part parts of
the brain the whole the the the systems

4554
01:38:55,550 --> 01:38:55,560
the brain the whole the the the systems
 

4555
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:57,990
the brain the whole the the the systems
that are important for processing

4556
01:38:57,990 --> 01:38:58,000
that are important for processing
 

4557
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:02,470
that are important for processing
language you can see that some of these

4558
01:39:02,470 --> 01:39:02,480
language you can see that some of these
 

4559
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:04,390
language you can see that some of these
regions are also important for

4560
01:39:04,390 --> 01:39:04,400
regions are also important for
 

4561
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,669
regions are also important for
controlling your major organ systems and

4562
01:39:06,669 --> 01:39:06,679
controlling your major organ systems and
 

4563
01:39:06,679 --> 01:39:08,470
controlling your major organ systems and
your like your autonomic nervous system

4564
01:39:08,470 --> 01:39:08,480
your like your autonomic nervous system
 

4565
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:10,910
your like your autonomic nervous system
that controls your cardiovascular system

4566
01:39:10,910 --> 01:39:10,920
that controls your cardiovascular system
 

4567
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:13,669
that controls your cardiovascular system
your respiratory system and so on that

4568
01:39:13,669 --> 01:39:13,679
your respiratory system and so on that
 

4569
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:17,669
your respiratory system and so on that
you know these regions control your uh

4570
01:39:17,669 --> 01:39:17,679
you know these regions control your uh
 

4571
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:20,750
you know these regions control your uh
endocrine system your immune system and

4572
01:39:20,750 --> 01:39:20,760
endocrine system your immune system and
 

4573
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:23,030
endocrine system your immune system and
so on so and you can actually see this

4574
01:39:23,030 --> 01:39:23,040
so on so and you can actually see this
 

4575
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:25,149
so on so and you can actually see this
in other animals too so in birds for

4576
01:39:25,149 --> 01:39:25,159
in other animals too so in birds for
 

4577
01:39:25,159 --> 01:39:27,950
in other animals too so in birds for
example the neurons that are responsible

4578
01:39:27,950 --> 01:39:27,960
example the neurons that are responsible
 

4579
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:30,350
example the neurons that are responsible
for bird song also control the systems

4580
01:39:30,350 --> 01:39:30,360
for bird song also control the systems
 

4581
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:32,709
for bird song also control the systems
of a bird's body and the reason why I

4582
01:39:32,709 --> 01:39:32,719
of a bird's body and the reason why I
 

4583
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:36,310
of a bird's body and the reason why I
bring that up is that the there's some

4584
01:39:36,310 --> 01:39:36,320
bring that up is that the there's some
 

4585
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:40,149
bring that up is that the there's some
scientists think that the anatomy um of

4586
01:39:40,149 --> 01:39:40,159
scientists think that the anatomy um of
 

4587
01:39:40,159 --> 01:39:42,709
scientists think that the anatomy um of
a of a bird's brain that control bird

4588
01:39:42,709 --> 01:39:42,719
a of a bird's brain that control bird
 

4589
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:45,990
a of a bird's brain that control bird
song or homologous or structurally have

4590
01:39:45,990 --> 01:39:46,000
song or homologous or structurally have
 

4591
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,310
song or homologous or structurally have
a similar origin to the human system for

4592
01:39:48,310 --> 01:39:48,320
a similar origin to the human system for
 

4593
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:51,229
a similar origin to the human system for
a language so the parts of the brain

4594
01:39:51,229 --> 01:39:51,239
a language so the parts of the brain
 

4595
01:39:51,239 --> 01:39:52,589
a language so the parts of the brain
that are important for processing

4596
01:39:52,589 --> 01:39:52,599
that are important for processing
 

4597
01:39:52,599 --> 01:39:55,790
that are important for processing
language are not unique in U and

4598
01:39:55,790 --> 01:39:55,800
language are not unique in U and
 

4599
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:58,310
language are not unique in U and
specialized for language they do many

4600
01:39:58,310 --> 01:39:58,320
specialized for language they do many
 

4601
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:00,790
specialized for language they do many
things and one of the things they do is

4602
01:40:00,790 --> 01:40:00,800
things and one of the things they do is
 

4603
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:03,629
things and one of the things they do is
um control your major organ systems do

4604
01:40:03,629 --> 01:40:03,639
um control your major organ systems do
 

4605
01:40:03,639 --> 01:40:05,390
um control your major organ systems do
you think we can fall in love have

4606
01:40:05,390 --> 01:40:05,400
you think we can fall in love have
 

4607
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:07,870
you think we can fall in love have
arguments about this all the time uh do

4608
01:40:07,870 --> 01:40:07,880
arguments about this all the time uh do
 

4609
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:09,310
arguments about this all the time uh do
you think we can fall in love based on

4610
01:40:09,310 --> 01:40:09,320
you think we can fall in love based on
 

4611
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:11,270
you think we can fall in love based on
words alone well I think people have

4612
01:40:11,270 --> 01:40:11,280
words alone well I think people have
 

4613
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:12,910
words alone well I think people have
been doing it for

4614
01:40:12,910 --> 01:40:12,920
been doing it for
 

4615
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:15,229
been doing it for
centuries I mean they it used to be the

4616
01:40:15,229 --> 01:40:15,239
centuries I mean they it used to be the
 

4617
01:40:15,239 --> 01:40:16,750
centuries I mean they it used to be the
case of people wrote letters to each

4618
01:40:16,750 --> 01:40:16,760
case of people wrote letters to each
 

4619
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:20,229
case of people wrote letters to each
other yeah um with you know and then uh

4620
01:40:20,229 --> 01:40:20,239
other yeah um with you know and then uh
 

4621
01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:22,229
other yeah um with you know and then uh
that was how they communicated and I

4622
01:40:22,229 --> 01:40:22,239
that was how they communicated and I
 

4623
01:40:22,239 --> 01:40:24,270
that was how they communicated and I
guess that's how you and Dan got exact

4624
01:40:24,270 --> 01:40:24,280
guess that's how you and Dan got exact
 

4625
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:28,070
guess that's how you and Dan got exact
exactly exactly exactly yeah exactly so

4626
01:40:28,070 --> 01:40:28,080
exactly exactly exactly yeah exactly so
 

4627
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:31,390
exactly exactly exactly yeah exactly so
is the answer a clear yes there because

4628
01:40:31,390 --> 01:40:31,400
is the answer a clear yes there because
 

4629
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:33,589
is the answer a clear yes there because
I get a lot of push back from people

4630
01:40:33,589 --> 01:40:33,599
I get a lot of push back from people
 

4631
01:40:33,599 --> 01:40:36,790
I get a lot of push back from people
often that you need you need the touch

4632
01:40:36,790 --> 01:40:36,800
often that you need you need the touch
 

4633
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:38,470
often that you need you need the touch
and the

4634
01:40:38,470 --> 01:40:38,480
and the
 

4635
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:42,149
and the
smell and uh you know the bodily stuff I

4636
01:40:42,149 --> 01:40:42,159
smell and uh you know the bodily stuff I
 

4637
01:40:42,159 --> 01:40:43,589
smell and uh you know the bodily stuff I
think the touch and the smell and the

4638
01:40:43,589 --> 01:40:43,599
think the touch and the smell and the
 

4639
01:40:43,599 --> 01:40:46,589
think the touch and the smell and the
bodily stuff helps okay but I don't

4640
01:40:46,589 --> 01:40:46,599
bodily stuff helps okay but I don't
 

4641
01:40:46,599 --> 01:40:48,189
bodily stuff helps okay but I don't
think it's necessary do you think you

4642
01:40:48,189 --> 01:40:48,199
think it's necessary do you think you
 

4643
01:40:48,199 --> 01:40:50,510
think it's necessary do you think you
can have a lifelong monogamous

4644
01:40:50,510 --> 01:40:50,520
can have a lifelong monogamous
 

4645
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:53,510
can have a lifelong monogamous
relationship ship with an AI system that

4646
01:40:53,510 --> 01:40:53,520
relationship ship with an AI system that
 

4647
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:55,470
relationship ship with an AI system that
only communicates with you on text

4648
01:40:55,470 --> 01:40:55,480
only communicates with you on text
 

4649
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:57,109
only communicates with you on text
romantic

4650
01:40:57,109 --> 01:40:57,119
romantic
 

4651
01:40:57,119 --> 01:40:59,390
romantic
relationship well I suppose that's an

4652
01:40:59,390 --> 01:40:59,400
relationship well I suppose that's an
 

4653
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:01,390
relationship well I suppose that's an
empirical question that hasn't been

4654
01:41:01,390 --> 01:41:01,400
empirical question that hasn't been
 

4655
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:04,030
empirical question that hasn't been
answered yet but so I I guess what I

4656
01:41:04,030 --> 01:41:04,040
answered yet but so I I guess what I
 

4657
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:06,990
answered yet but so I I guess what I
would say is

4658
01:41:06,990 --> 01:41:07,000

 

4659
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,870

um I don't think I

4660
01:41:09,870 --> 01:41:09,880
um I don't think I
 

4661
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:13,430
um I don't think I
could could any human could the average

4662
01:41:13,430 --> 01:41:13,440
could could any human could the average
 

4663
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:19,830
could could any human could the average
human could you know so so um if I if I

4664
01:41:19,830 --> 01:41:19,840
human could you know so so um if I if I
 

4665
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:23,270
human could you know so so um if I if I
um I I even I want to even I want to

4666
01:41:23,270 --> 01:41:23,280
um I I even I want to even I want to
 

4667
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:26,030
um I I even I want to even I want to
even modify that and say I'm thinking

4668
01:41:26,030 --> 01:41:26,040
even modify that and say I'm thinking
 

4669
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:30,709
even modify that and say I'm thinking
now of um Tom Hanks um and um the movie

4670
01:41:30,709 --> 01:41:30,719
now of um Tom Hanks um and um the movie
 

4671
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:33,950
now of um Tom Hanks um and um the movie
um cway yeah you know with Wilson yeah I

4672
01:41:33,950 --> 01:41:33,960
um cway yeah you know with Wilson yeah I
 

4673
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:36,669
um cway yeah you know with Wilson yeah I
think if if that was if you had to make

4674
01:41:36,669 --> 01:41:36,679
think if if that was if you had to make
 

4675
01:41:36,679 --> 01:41:38,950
think if if that was if you had to make
that work if you had to make that work

4676
01:41:38,950 --> 01:41:38,960
that work if you had to make that work
 

4677
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:40,910
that work if you had to make that work
well the volleyball yeah if you had to

4678
01:41:40,910 --> 01:41:40,920
well the volleyball yeah if you had to
 

4679
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:43,669
well the volleyball yeah if you had to
make it work could you you could you

4680
01:41:43,669 --> 01:41:43,679
make it work could you you could you
 

4681
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:45,750
make it work could you you could you
prediction and simulation right so if

4682
01:41:45,750 --> 01:41:45,760
prediction and simulation right so if
 

4683
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:47,950
prediction and simulation right so if
you had to make it work could you make

4684
01:41:47,950 --> 01:41:47,960
you had to make it work could you make
 

4685
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:51,990
you had to make it work could you make
it work using simulation and you know

4686
01:41:51,990 --> 01:41:52,000
it work using simulation and you know
 

4687
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:55,229
it work using simulation and you know
your past experience could you make it

4688
01:41:55,229 --> 01:41:55,239
your past experience could you make it
 

4689
01:41:55,239 --> 01:41:57,470
your past experience could you make it
work could you make it work you as a

4690
01:41:57,470 --> 01:41:57,480
work could you make it work you as a
 

4691
01:41:57,480 --> 01:41:59,990
work could you make it work you as a
human could you could you like could you

4692
01:41:59,990 --> 01:42:00,000
human could you could you like could you
 

4693
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,430
human could you could you like could you
have a could you have a relationship

4694
01:42:01,430 --> 01:42:01,440
have a could you have a relationship
 

4695
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:03,709
have a could you have a relationship
literally with an inanimate object and

4696
01:42:03,709 --> 01:42:03,719
literally with an inanimate object and
 

4697
01:42:03,719 --> 01:42:06,030
literally with an inanimate object and
have it sustain you in the way uh that

4698
01:42:06,030 --> 01:42:06,040
have it sustain you in the way uh that
 

4699
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:09,109
have it sustain you in the way uh that
another human could yeah um your life

4700
01:42:09,109 --> 01:42:09,119
another human could yeah um your life
 

4701
01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:11,390
another human could yeah um your life
would probably be shorter because you

4702
01:42:11,390 --> 01:42:11,400
would probably be shorter because you
 

4703
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:13,270
would probably be shorter because you
wouldn't actually derive the body

4704
01:42:13,270 --> 01:42:13,280
wouldn't actually derive the body
 

4705
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:16,350
wouldn't actually derive the body
budgeting benefits from right so um

4706
01:42:16,350 --> 01:42:16,360
budgeting benefits from right so um
 

4707
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:20,830
budgeting benefits from right so um
we've talked about uh you know how um

4708
01:42:20,830 --> 01:42:20,840
we've talked about uh you know how um
 

4709
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:23,189
we've talked about uh you know how um
your brain its most important job is to

4710
01:42:23,189 --> 01:42:23,199
your brain its most important job is to
 

4711
01:42:23,199 --> 01:42:25,669
your brain its most important job is to
control your body and you can describe

4712
01:42:25,669 --> 01:42:25,679
control your body and you can describe
 

4713
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:27,149
control your body and you can describe
that as your brain running a budget for

4714
01:42:27,149 --> 01:42:27,159
that as your brain running a budget for
 

4715
01:42:27,159 --> 01:42:30,470
that as your brain running a budget for
your body yes and um there are

4716
01:42:30,470 --> 01:42:30,480
your body yes and um there are
 

4717
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:32,350
your body yes and um there are
metaphorical you know deposits and

4718
01:42:32,350 --> 01:42:32,360
metaphorical you know deposits and
 

4719
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:35,070
metaphorical you know deposits and
withdrawals into your body budget and

4720
01:42:35,070 --> 01:42:35,080
withdrawals into your body budget and
 

4721
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:37,310
withdrawals into your body budget and
you also make deposits and withdrawals

4722
01:42:37,310 --> 01:42:37,320
you also make deposits and withdrawals
 

4723
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:39,390
you also make deposits and withdrawals
in other people's body budgets

4724
01:42:39,390 --> 01:42:39,400
in other people's body budgets
 

4725
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:41,910
in other people's body budgets
figuratively speaking so you wouldn't

4726
01:42:41,910 --> 01:42:41,920
figuratively speaking so you wouldn't
 

4727
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:45,910
figuratively speaking so you wouldn't
have that particular benefit um uh so

4728
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:45,920
have that particular benefit um uh so
 

4729
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:48,990
have that particular benefit um uh so
your life would probably be shorter but

4730
01:42:48,990 --> 01:42:49,000
your life would probably be shorter but
 

4731
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,790
your life would probably be shorter but
I think it would be harder for some

4732
01:42:50,790 --> 01:42:50,800
I think it would be harder for some
 

4733
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,990
I think it would be harder for some
people than for other people yeah I T my

4734
01:42:52,990 --> 01:42:53,000
people than for other people yeah I T my
 

4735
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,550
people than for other people yeah I T my
intuition is that you can have a deep

4736
01:42:54,550 --> 01:42:54,560
intuition is that you can have a deep
 

4737
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:58,270
intuition is that you can have a deep
fulfilling relationship with a

4738
01:42:58,270 --> 01:42:58,280
fulfilling relationship with a
 

4739
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:01,669
fulfilling relationship with a
volleyball I think I think a lot of

4740
01:43:01,669 --> 01:43:01,679
volleyball I think I think a lot of
 

4741
01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:04,189
volleyball I think I think a lot of
the the environments that set up I think

4742
01:43:04,189 --> 01:43:04,199
the the environments that set up I think
 

4743
01:43:04,199 --> 01:43:07,669
the the environments that set up I think
that's a really good example like the

4744
01:43:07,669 --> 01:43:07,679
that's a really good example like the
 

4745
01:43:07,679 --> 01:43:10,350
that's a really good example like the
constraints of your particular

4746
01:43:10,350 --> 01:43:10,360
constraints of your particular
 

4747
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:12,990
constraints of your particular
environment Define the like I I believe

4748
01:43:12,990 --> 01:43:13,000
environment Define the like I I believe
 

4749
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:17,229
environment Define the like I I believe
like scarcity is a good Catalyst for

4750
01:43:17,229 --> 01:43:17,239
like scarcity is a good Catalyst for
 

4751
01:43:17,239 --> 01:43:19,510
like scarcity is a good Catalyst for
deep meaningful connection with other

4752
01:43:19,510 --> 01:43:19,520
deep meaningful connection with other
 

4753
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:22,310
deep meaningful connection with other
humans and with in animal objects so the

4754
01:43:22,310 --> 01:43:22,320
humans and with in animal objects so the
 

4755
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,870
humans and with in animal objects so the
less you have the more fulfilling those

4756
01:43:24,870 --> 01:43:24,880
less you have the more fulfilling those
 

4757
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:27,550
less you have the more fulfilling those
relationships are and I would say a

4758
01:43:27,550 --> 01:43:27,560
relationships are and I would say a
 

4759
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:29,629
relationships are and I would say a
relationship with a volleyball the sex

4760
01:43:29,629 --> 01:43:29,639
relationship with a volleyball the sex
 

4761
01:43:29,639 --> 01:43:31,709
relationship with a volleyball the sex
is not great but uh everything else I

4762
01:43:31,709 --> 01:43:31,719
is not great but uh everything else I
 

4763
01:43:31,719 --> 01:43:34,030
is not great but uh everything else I
feel like it could be a very fulfilling

4764
01:43:34,030 --> 01:43:34,040
feel like it could be a very fulfilling
 

4765
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:36,109
feel like it could be a very fulfilling
relationship which I don't know from an

4766
01:43:36,109 --> 01:43:36,119
relationship which I don't know from an
 

4767
01:43:36,119 --> 01:43:37,870
relationship which I don't know from an
engineering perspective what to do with

4768
01:43:37,870 --> 01:43:37,880
engineering perspective what to do with
 

4769
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:39,870
engineering perspective what to do with
that just like you said it is an

4770
01:43:39,870 --> 01:43:39,880
that just like you said it is an
 

4771
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:41,990
that just like you said it is an
empirical question but but there are

4772
01:43:41,990 --> 01:43:42,000
empirical question but but there are
 

4773
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,030
empirical question but but there are
places to learn about that right so for

4774
01:43:44,030 --> 01:43:44,040
places to learn about that right so for
 

4775
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:48,189
places to learn about that right so for
example think about children and their

4776
01:43:48,189 --> 01:43:48,199
example think about children and their
 

4777
01:43:48,199 --> 01:43:50,149
example think about children and their
blankets right so there there's

4778
01:43:50,149 --> 01:43:50,159
blankets right so there there's
 

4779
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:51,790
blankets right so there there's
something tactile and there's something

4780
01:43:51,790 --> 01:43:51,800
something tactile and there's something
 

4781
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:52,790
something tactile and there's something
old

4782
01:43:52,790 --> 01:43:52,800
old
 

4783
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:55,229
old
factory and it's very

4784
01:43:55,229 --> 01:43:55,239
factory and it's very
 

4785
01:43:55,239 --> 01:43:57,990
factory and it's very
comforting I mean even for even for

4786
01:43:57,990 --> 01:43:58,000
comforting I mean even for even for
 

4787
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,310
comforting I mean even for even for
non-human little animals right like

4788
01:44:00,310 --> 01:44:00,320
non-human little animals right like
 

4789
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:02,709
non-human little animals right like
puppies and so I don't know about cats

4790
01:44:02,709 --> 01:44:02,719
puppies and so I don't know about cats
 

4791
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:05,790
puppies and so I don't know about cats
but um but cats are cold-hearted they're

4792
01:44:05,790 --> 01:44:05,800
but um but cats are cold-hearted they're
 

4793
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:08,189
but um but cats are cold-hearted they're
there there's no there's nothing going

4794
01:44:08,189 --> 01:44:08,199
there there's no there's nothing going

because if you know if we take Twitter's
 

4987
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:22,550
because if you know if we take Twitter's
an example if I actually send a tweet

4988
01:48:22,550 --> 01:48:22,560
an example if I actually send a tweet
 

4989
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:24,310
an example if I actually send a tweet
last night and a tweet this morning it's

4990
01:48:24,310 --> 01:48:24,320
last night and a tweet this morning it's
 

4991
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:26,910
last night and a tweet this morning it's
going to be very two different

4992
01:48:26,910 --> 01:48:26,920
going to be very two different
 

4993
01:48:26,920 --> 01:48:29,750
going to be very two different
people a tweeting that and I don't know

4994
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:29,760
people a tweeting that and I don't know
 

4995
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:31,390
people a tweeting that and I don't know
what to do with that because one does

4996
01:48:31,390 --> 01:48:31,400
what to do with that because one does
 

4997
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:35,109
what to do with that because one does
seem to be more me than the other but

4998
01:48:35,109 --> 01:48:35,119
seem to be more me than the other but
 

4999
01:48:35,119 --> 01:48:37,149
seem to be more me than the other but
that's maybe because there's a Nar the

5000
01:48:37,149 --> 01:48:37,159
that's maybe because there's a Nar the
 

5001
01:48:37,159 --> 01:48:38,870
that's maybe because there's a Nar the
story that I'm trying this something I'm

5002
01:48:38,870 --> 01:48:38,880
story that I'm trying this something I'm
 

5003
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:42,109
story that I'm trying this something I'm
striving to be like the ultimate human

5004
01:48:42,109 --> 01:48:42,119
striving to be like the ultimate human
 

5005
01:48:42,119 --> 01:48:43,830
striving to be like the ultimate human
that I might become I have maybe a

5006
01:48:43,830 --> 01:48:43,840
that I might become I have maybe a
 

5007
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:45,550
that I might become I have maybe a
vision of that and I'm trying to become

5008
01:48:45,550 --> 01:48:45,560
vision of that and I'm trying to become
 

5009
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:48,589
vision of that and I'm trying to become
that but it it does seem like there's a

5010
01:48:48,589 --> 01:48:48,599
that but it it does seem like there's a
 

5011
01:48:48,599 --> 01:48:51,189
that but it it does seem like there's a
lot of different Minds in there

5012
01:48:51,189 --> 01:48:51,199
lot of different Minds in there
 

5013
01:48:51,199 --> 01:48:53,669
lot of different Minds in there
and they're all like like having a

5014
01:48:53,669 --> 01:48:53,679
and they're all like like having a
 

5015
01:48:53,679 --> 01:48:56,070
and they're all like like having a
discussion and a battle for who's going

5016
01:48:56,070 --> 01:48:56,080
discussion and a battle for who's going
 

5017
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:57,750
discussion and a battle for who's going
to win I suppose you could think of it

5018
01:48:57,750 --> 01:48:57,760
to win I suppose you could think of it
 

5019
01:48:57,760 --> 01:48:59,109
to win I suppose you could think of it
that way but there's another way to

5020
01:48:59,109 --> 01:48:59,119
that way but there's another way to
 

5021
01:48:59,119 --> 01:49:01,870
that way but there's another way to
think of it I think and that is that um

5022
01:49:01,870 --> 01:49:01,880
think of it I think and that is that um
 

5023
01:49:01,880 --> 01:49:03,430
think of it I think and that is that um
maybe the more Buddhist way to think of

5024
01:49:03,430 --> 01:49:03,440
maybe the more Buddhist way to think of
 

5025
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:05,189
maybe the more Buddhist way to think of
it right or more contemplative way to

5026
01:49:05,189 --> 01:49:05,199
it right or more contemplative way to
 

5027
01:49:05,199 --> 01:49:06,790
it right or more contemplative way to
think about it which is not that you

5028
01:49:06,790 --> 01:49:06,800
think about it which is not that you
 

5029
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:09,430
think about it which is not that you
have multiple personalities inside your

5030
01:49:09,430 --> 01:49:09,440
have multiple personalities inside your
 

5031
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:14,870
have multiple personalities inside your
head but you have your brain has this

5032
01:49:14,870 --> 01:49:14,880
head but you have your brain has this
 

5033
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:17,229
head but you have your brain has this
um amazing

5034
01:49:17,229 --> 01:49:17,239
um amazing
 

5035
01:49:17,239 --> 01:49:22,629
um amazing
capacity it it has a a population of

5036
01:49:22,629 --> 01:49:22,639
capacity it it has a a population of
 

5037
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:25,430
capacity it it has a a population of
experiences that you've had that it can

5038
01:49:25,430 --> 01:49:25,440
experiences that you've had that it can
 

5039
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:28,990
experiences that you've had that it can
regenerate reconstitute and it can even

5040
01:49:28,990 --> 01:49:29,000
regenerate reconstitute and it can even
 

5041
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:32,070
regenerate reconstitute and it can even
take bits and pieces of those

5042
01:49:32,070 --> 01:49:32,080
take bits and pieces of those
 

5043
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:33,910
take bits and pieces of those
experiences and combine them into

5044
01:49:33,910 --> 01:49:33,920
experiences and combine them into
 

5045
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:37,790
experiences and combine them into
something new um and it's often doing

5046
01:49:37,790 --> 01:49:37,800
something new um and it's often doing
 

5047
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:40,229
something new um and it's often doing
this to predict what's going to happen

5048
01:49:40,229 --> 01:49:40,239
this to predict what's going to happen
 

5049
01:49:40,239 --> 01:49:42,990
this to predict what's going to happen
next and to plan your actions but it's

5050
01:49:42,990 --> 01:49:43,000
next and to plan your actions but it's
 

5051
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:46,310
next and to plan your actions but it's
also happening this also happens just um

5052
01:49:46,310 --> 01:49:46,320
also happening this also happens just um
 

5053
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:48,109
also happening this also happens just um
that's what mind wandering is or just

5054
01:49:48,109 --> 01:49:48,119
that's what mind wandering is or just
 

5055
01:49:48,119 --> 01:49:50,229
that's what mind wandering is or just
internal thought and and so on that's

5056
01:49:50,229 --> 01:49:50,239
internal thought and and so on that's
 

5057
01:49:50,239 --> 01:49:53,990
internal thought and and so on that's
it's the same mechanism really and so a

5058
01:49:53,990 --> 01:49:54,000
it's the same mechanism really and so a
 

5059
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,109
it's the same mechanism really and so a
lot of times we hear the saying you know

5060
01:49:57,109 --> 01:49:57,119
lot of times we hear the saying you know
 

5061
01:49:57,119 --> 01:49:58,750
lot of times we hear the saying you know
just think if you think differently

5062
01:49:58,750 --> 01:49:58,760
just think if you think differently
 

5063
01:49:58,760 --> 01:49:59,910
just think if you think differently
you'll feel

5064
01:49:59,910 --> 01:49:59,920
you'll feel
 

5065
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:03,470
you'll feel
differently but your brain is having a

5066
01:50:03,470 --> 01:50:03,480
differently but your brain is having a
 

5067
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:06,629
differently but your brain is having a
conversation continually with your body

5068
01:50:06,629 --> 01:50:06,639
conversation continually with your body
 

5069
01:50:06,639 --> 01:50:09,310
conversation continually with your body
and your body your brain's you know

5070
01:50:09,310 --> 01:50:09,320
and your body your brain's you know
 

5071
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:11,430
and your body your brain's you know
trying to control your body well trying

01:50:11,430 --> 01:50:11,440
trying to control your body well trying
 

5073
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:13,109
trying to control your body well trying
your brain is controlling your body your

5074
01:50:13,109 --> 01:50:13,119
your brain is controlling your body your
 

5075
01:50:13,119 --> 01:50:15,189
your brain is controlling your body your
body is sending information back to the

5076
01:50:15,189 --> 01:50:15,199
body is sending information back to the
 

5077
01:50:15,199 --> 01:50:18,430
body is sending information back to the
brain and impart the information that

5078
01:50:18,430 --> 01:50:18,440
brain and impart the information that
 

5079
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:22,390
brain and impart the information that
your body sends back to your brain

5080
01:50:22,390 --> 01:50:22,400

 

5081
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:24,030

just like the information coming from

5082
01:50:24,030 --> 01:50:24,040
just like the information coming from
 

5083
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:25,229
just like the information coming from
the

5084
01:50:25,229 --> 01:50:25,239
the
 

5085
01:50:25,239 --> 01:50:28,070
the
world initiates the next volley of

world initiates the next volley of
 

5087
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:30,950
world initiates the next volley of
predictions or simulations so in some

5088
01:50:30,950 --> 01:50:30,960
predictions or simulations so in some
 

5089
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:33,149
predictions or simulations so in some
ways you could also

5090
01:50:33,149 --> 01:50:33,159
ways you could also
 

5091
01:50:33,159 --> 01:50:36,430
ways you could also
say the way that you feel your I think

5092

or mood coming from the sensations of
 

5097
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,069
or mood coming from the sensations of
body budgeting you know

5098
01:50:45,069 --> 01:50:45,079
body budgeting you know
 

5099
01:50:45,079 --> 01:50:46,870
body budgeting you know
um

5100
01:50:46,870 --> 01:50:46,880
um
 

5101
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:49,030
um
influences what you

5102
01:50:49,030 --> 01:50:49,040
influences what you
 

5103
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:50,750
influences what you

and um as much as so feelings influence
 

5107
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:56,990
and um as much as so feelings influence
thought as much as thought influence

thought as much as thought influence
feeling and maybe more but just the the

5110
01:50:59,510 --> 01:50:59,520
feeling and maybe more but just the the
 

5111
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:01,629
feeling and maybe more but just the the
whole thing doesn't seem stable well

5112
01:51:01,629 --> 01:51:01,639
whole thing doesn't seem stable well
 

5113
01:51:01,639 --> 01:51:05,229
whole thing doesn't seem stable well
it's a dynamic system Mr engineer yeah

5114
01:51:05,229 --> 01:51:05,239
it's a dynamic system Mr engineer yeah
 

5115
01:51:05,239 --> 01:51:07,030
it's a dynamic system Mr engineer yeah
right it's a dynamic it's a dynamical

5116
01:51:07,030 --> 01:51:07,040
right it's a dynamic it's a dynamical
 

5117
01:51:07,040 --> 01:51:09,310
right it's a dynamic it's a dynamical
system right nonlinear dynamical system

5118
01:51:09,310 --> 01:51:09,320
system right nonlinear dynamical system
 

5119
01:51:09,320 --> 01:51:11,069
system right nonlinear dynamical system
in a re and I think that's I'm actually

5120
01:51:11,069 --> 01:51:11,079
in a re and I think that's I'm actually
 

5121
01:51:11,079 --> 01:51:12,189
in a re and I think that's I'm actually
writing a paper with a bunch of

5122
01:51:12,189 --> 01:51:12,199
writing a paper with a bunch of
 

5123
01:51:12,199 --> 01:51:14,990
writing a paper with a bunch of
Engineers about the about this actually

5124
01:51:14,990 --> 01:51:15,000
Engineers about the about this actually
 

5125
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,910
Engineers about the about this actually
but um I I mean other people have talked

5126
01:51:16,910 --> 01:51:16,920
but um I I mean other people have talked
 

5127
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:18,510
but um I I mean other people have talked
about the brain as a dynamical system

5128
01:51:18,510 --> 01:51:18,520
about the brain as a dynamical system
 

5129
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:21,270
about the brain as a dynamical system
before but you know the real tricky bit

5130
01:51:21,270 --> 01:51:21,280
before but you know the real tricky bit
 

5131
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:22,709
before but you know the real tricky bit
is trying to figure out how do you get

5132
01:51:22,709 --> 01:51:22,719
is trying to figure out how do you get
 

5133
01:51:22,719 --> 01:51:24,910
is trying to figure out how do you get
mental features out of that system like

5134
01:51:24,910 --> 01:51:24,920
mental features out of that system like
 

5135
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:26,109
mental features out of that system like
it's one thing to figure out how you get

5136
01:51:26,109 --> 01:51:26,119
it's one thing to figure out how you get
 

5137
01:51:26,119 --> 01:51:27,870
it's one thing to figure out how you get
a motor movement out of that system it's

5138
01:51:27,870 --> 01:51:27,880
a motor movement out of that system it's
 

5139
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:29,189
a motor movement out of that system it's
another thing to figure out how you get

5140
01:51:29,189 --> 01:51:29,199
another thing to figure out how you get
 

5141
01:51:29,199 --> 01:51:32,430
another thing to figure out how you get
a mental feature like a feeling of being

5142
01:51:32,430 --> 01:51:32,440
a mental feature like a feeling of being
 

5143
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:34,790
a mental feature like a feeling of being
loved or a feeling of being worthwhile

5144
01:51:34,790 --> 01:51:34,800
loved or a feeling of being worthwhile
 

5145
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:37,629
loved or a feeling of being worthwhile
or a feeling of you know just basically

5146
01:51:37,629 --> 01:51:37,639
or a feeling of you know just basically
 

5147
01:51:37,639 --> 01:51:39,149
or a feeling of you know just basically
feeling like how do you get a

5148
01:51:39,149 --> 01:51:39,159
feeling like how do you get a
 

5149
01:51:39,159 --> 01:51:41,390
feeling like how do you get a
feeling a mental Fe a mental features

5150
01:51:41,390 --> 01:51:41,400
feeling a mental Fe a mental features
 

5151
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:44,350
feeling a mental Fe a mental features
out of out of that system um so I would

5152
01:51:44,350 --> 01:51:44,360
out of out of that system um so I would
 

5153
01:51:44,360 --> 01:51:48,310
out of out of that system um so I would
what I would say is that you aren't the

5154
01:51:48,310 --> 01:51:48,320
what I would say is that you aren't the
 

5155
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:49,750
what I would say is that you aren't the
the Buddhist thing to say is that you're

5156
01:51:49,750 --> 01:51:49,760
the Buddhist thing to say is that you're
 

5157
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:51,669
the Buddhist thing to say is that you're
not one person and you're not many

5158
01:51:51,669 --> 01:51:51,679
not one person and you're not many
 

5159
01:51:51,679 --> 01:51:56,830
not one person and you're not many
people you are um you are the sum of

5160
01:51:56,830 --> 01:51:56,840
people you are um you are the sum of
 

5161
01:51:56,840 --> 01:51:59,830
people you are um you are the sum of
your experiences and who you are in any

5162
01:51:59,830 --> 01:51:59,840
your experiences and who you are in any
 

5163
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:00,990
your experiences and who you are in any
given

5164
01:52:00,990 --> 01:52:01,000
given
 

5165
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:04,990
given
moment meaning what your actions will be

5166
01:52:04,990 --> 01:52:05,000
moment meaning what your actions will be
 

5167
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,629
moment meaning what your actions will be
is influenced by the state of your body

5168
01:52:07,629 --> 01:52:07,639
is influenced by the state of your body
 

5169
01:52:07,639 --> 01:52:08,910
is influenced by the state of your body
and the state of the world that you've

5170
01:52:08,910 --> 01:52:08,920
and the state of the world that you've
 

5171
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:11,629
and the state of the world that you've
put yourself in and you can change

5172
01:52:11,629 --> 01:52:11,639
put yourself in and you can change
 

5173
01:52:11,639 --> 01:52:13,470
put yourself in and you can change
either of those things one is a little

5174
01:52:13,470 --> 01:52:13,480
either of those things one is a little
 

5175
01:52:13,480 --> 01:52:15,149
either of those things one is a little
easier to change than the other right

5176
01:52:15,149 --> 01:52:15,159
easier to change than the other right
 

5177
01:52:15,159 --> 01:52:16,830
easier to change than the other right
you can change your environment by

5178
01:52:16,830 --> 01:52:16,840
you can change your environment by
 

5179
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:19,390
you can change your environment by
literally getting up and moving or you

5180

literally getting up and moving or you
 

5181
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:21,350
literally getting up and moving or you
can change by paying attention to some

5182
01:52:21,350 --> 01:52:21,360
can change by paying attention to some
 

5183
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:23,430
can change by paying attention to some
things differently and letting other

5184
01:52:23,430 --> 01:52:23,440
things differently and letting other
 

5185
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:26,270
things differently and letting other
some features um come to the FL and

5186
01:52:26,270 --> 01:52:26,280
some features um come to the FL and
 

5187
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:28,229
some features um come to the FL and
other features be backgrounded like I'm

5188
01:52:28,229 --> 01:52:28,239
other features be backgrounded like I'm
 

5189
01:52:28,239 --> 01:52:30,830
other features be backgrounded like I'm
looking around your place oh no and I

5190
01:52:30,830 --> 01:52:30,840
looking around your place oh no and I
 

5191
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:32,629
looking around your place oh no and I
see this is not something you should do

5192
01:52:32,629 --> 01:52:32,639
see this is not something you should do
 

5193
01:52:32,639 --> 01:52:33,950
see this is not something you should do
no I'm not but I'm going to say one

5194
01:52:33,950 --> 01:52:33,960
no I'm not but I'm going to say one
 

5195
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:37,030
no I'm not but I'm going to say one
thing yeah no green

5196
01:52:37,030 --> 01:52:37,040
thing yeah no green
 

5197
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:40,350
thing yeah no green
plants no green plants cuz green plants

5198
01:52:40,350 --> 01:52:40,360
plants no green plants cuz green plants
 

5199
01:52:40,360 --> 01:52:42,189
plants no green plants cuz green plants
mean a home and I want this to be

5200
01:52:42,189 --> 01:52:42,199
mean a home and I want this to be
 

5201
01:52:42,199 --> 01:52:46,430
mean a home and I want this to be
temporary fair fair but what's what's

5202
01:52:46,430 --> 01:52:46,440
temporary fair fair but what's what's
 

5203
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:47,790
temporary fair fair but what's what's
what goes to your mind when you see no

5204
01:52:47,790 --> 01:52:47,800
what goes to your mind when you see no
 

5205
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:49,350
what goes to your mind when you see no
green plants no I'm just making the

5206
01:52:49,350 --> 01:52:49,360
green plants no I'm just making the
 

5207
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:50,950
green plants no I'm just making the
point that but

5208
01:52:50,950 --> 01:52:50,960
point that but
 

5209
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:56,030
point that but
um what if you like again you know not

5210
01:52:56,030 --> 01:52:56,040
um what if you like again you know not
 

5211
01:52:56,040 --> 01:52:58,189
um what if you like again you know not
everybody has control over their

5212
01:52:58,189 --> 01:52:58,199
everybody has control over their
 

5213
01:52:58,199 --> 01:53:00,069
everybody has control over their
environment some people don't have

5214
01:53:00,069 --> 01:53:00,079
environment some people don't have
 

5215
01:53:00,079 --> 01:53:01,750
environment some people don't have
control over the noise or the

5216
01:53:01,750 --> 01:53:01,760
control over the noise or the
 

5217
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:03,589
control over the noise or the
temperature or you know any of those

5218
01:53:03,589 --> 01:53:03,599
temperature or you know any of those
 

5219
01:53:03,599 --> 01:53:06,189
temperature or you know any of those
things but everybody is a little bit of

5220
01:53:06,189 --> 01:53:06,199
things but everybody is a little bit of
 

5221
01:53:06,199 --> 01:53:09,550
things but everybody is a little bit of
control and you can place things in your

5222
01:53:09,550 --> 01:53:09,560
control and you can place things in your
 

5223
01:53:09,560 --> 01:53:11,109
control and you can place things in your
environment

5224

photographs yes

5226
01:53:13,270 --> 01:53:13,280
photographs yes
 

5227

plants anything that's meaningful to you
 

5229
01:53:16,239 --> 01:53:18,550
plants anything that's meaningful to you
and use it as a shift of environment

5230
01:53:18,550 --> 01:53:18,560
and use it as a shift of environment
 

5231
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:21,709
and use it as a shift of environment
when you need it yes you can also do

5232
01:53:21,709 --> 01:53:21,719
when you need it yes you can also do
 

5233
01:53:21,719 --> 01:53:23,910
when you need it yes you can also do
things to change the conditions of your

5234
01:53:23,910 --> 01:53:23,920
things to change the conditions of your
 

5235
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:26,990
things to change the conditions of your
body when you exercise every day you're

5236
01:53:26,990 --> 01:53:27,000
body when you exercise every day you're
 

5237
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,750
body when you exercise every day you're
making an investment in your body

5238
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:29,760
making an investment in your body
 

5239
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:31,069
making an investment in your body
actually you're making an investment in

5240

actually you're making an investment in
 

5241
01:53:31,079 --> 01:53:33,589
actually you're making an investment in
your brain too it makes you even though

5242
01:53:33,589 --> 01:53:33,599
your brain too it makes you even though
 

5243
01:53:33,599 --> 01:53:36,350
your brain too it makes you even though
it's unpleasant and you know there's a

5244
01:53:36,350 --> 01:53:36,360
it's unpleasant and you know there's a
 

5245
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:38,870
it's unpleasant and you know there's a
cost to it if you replenish if you in

5246
01:53:38,870 --> 01:53:38,880
cost to it if you replenish if you in
 

5247
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:41,669
cost to it if you replenish if you in
invest and you make up that um you make

5248
01:53:41,669 --> 01:53:41,679
invest and you make up that um you make
 

5249
01:53:41,679 --> 01:53:44,189
invest and you make up that um you make
a deposit and you make up that um what

5250
01:53:44,189 --> 01:53:44,199
a deposit and you make up that um what
 

5251

the tap this is in most places maybe not
 

5265
01:54:01,199 --> 01:54:03,870
the tap this is in most places maybe not
you know maybe not everywhere but uh but

5266
01:54:03,870 --> 01:54:03,880
you know maybe not everywhere but uh but
 

5267
01:54:03,880 --> 01:54:06,990
you know maybe not everywhere but uh but
most places in the developed World um

5268
01:54:06,990 --> 01:54:07,000
most places in the developed World um
 

5269
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:10,550
most places in the developed World um
you can try to get enough sleep not

5270
01:54:10,550 --> 01:54:10,560
you can try to get enough sleep not
 

5271
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:12,750
you can try to get enough sleep not
everybody has that luxury but everybody

5272
01:54:12,750 --> 01:54:12,760
everybody has that luxury but everybody
 

5273
01:54:12,760 --> 01:54:16,669
everybody has that luxury but everybody
can do something to make their you know

5274
01:54:16,669 --> 01:54:16,679
can do something to make their you know
 

5275
01:54:16,679 --> 01:54:18,830
can do something to make their you know
body budgets a little more solvent and

5276
01:54:18,830 --> 01:54:18,840
body budgets a little more solvent and
 

5277
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:20,510
body budgets a little more solvent and
that will also

5278
01:54:20,510 --> 01:54:20,520
that will also
 

5279
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:22,990
that will also
make it more likely that certain

5280
01:54:22,990 --> 01:54:23,000
make it more likely that certain
 

5281
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,350
make it more likely that certain
thoughts will emerge from that

5282
01:54:25,350 --> 01:54:25,360
thoughts will emerge from that
 

5283
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:28,350
thoughts will emerge from that
prediction uh machine that's the control

5284
01:54:28,350 --> 01:54:28,360
prediction uh machine that's the control
 

5285
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:31,229
prediction uh machine that's the control
you do have is uh yeah being able to

5286
01:54:31,229 --> 01:54:31,239
you do have is uh yeah being able to
 

5287
01:54:31,239 --> 01:54:32,350
you do have is uh yeah being able to
control the environment that's really

5288
01:54:32,350 --> 01:54:32,360
control the environment that's really
 

5289
01:54:32,360 --> 01:54:35,830
control the environment that's really
well put uh on the I don't think we've

5290
01:54:35,830 --> 01:54:35,840
well put uh on the I don't think we've
 

5291
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:38,149
well put uh on the I don't think we've
talked about this so let's go to the

5292
01:54:38,149 --> 01:54:38,159
talked about this so let's go to the
 

5293
01:54:38,159 --> 01:54:40,669
talked about this so let's go to the
biggest unanswerable questions of

5294
01:54:40,669 --> 01:54:40,679
biggest unanswerable questions of
 

5295
01:54:40,679 --> 01:54:43,470
biggest unanswerable questions of
Consciousness what is you just rolled

5296
01:54:43,470 --> 01:54:43,480
Consciousness what is you just rolled
 

5297
01:54:43,480 --> 01:54:46,310
Consciousness what is you just rolled
your eyes I did that was my yeah so what

5298
01:54:46,310 --> 01:54:46,320
your eyes I did that was my yeah so what
 

5299
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:48,350
your eyes I did that was my yeah so what
is consciousness from a neuroscience

5300
01:54:48,350 --> 01:54:48,360
is consciousness from a neuroscience
 

5301
01:54:48,360 --> 01:54:51,669
is consciousness from a neuroscience
perspective I know you I

5302
01:54:51,669 --> 01:54:51,679
perspective I know you I
 

5303
01:54:51,679 --> 01:54:54,589
perspective I know you I
mean uh I made notes you know because

5304
01:54:54,589 --> 01:54:54,599
mean uh I made notes you know because
 

5305
01:54:54,599 --> 01:54:56,550
mean uh I made notes you know because
you gave me some questions in advance

5306
01:54:56,550 --> 01:54:56,560
you gave me some questions in advance
 

5307
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:58,430
you gave me some questions in advance
and I made notes for every single well

5308
01:54:58,430 --> 01:54:58,440
and I made notes for every single well
 

5309
01:54:58,440 --> 01:55:00,430
and I made notes for every single well
except that one yeah well that one I had

5310
01:55:00,430 --> 01:55:00,440
except that one yeah well that one I had
 

5311
01:55:00,440 --> 01:55:04,109
except that one yeah well that one I had
what the and then I took it out um

5312
01:55:04,109 --> 01:55:04,119
what the and then I took it out um
 

5313
01:55:04,119 --> 01:55:06,109
what the and then I took it out um
so is there something interesting

5314
01:55:06,109 --> 01:55:06,119
so is there something interesting
 

5315
01:55:06,119 --> 01:55:07,950
so is there something interesting
because you're so pragmatic is there

5316
01:55:07,950 --> 01:55:07,960
because you're so pragmatic is there
 

5317
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:10,350
because you're so pragmatic is there
something interesting to say about

5318
01:55:10,350 --> 01:55:10,360
something interesting to say about
 

5319
01:55:10,360 --> 01:55:13,350
something interesting to say about
intuition building about Consciousness

5320
01:55:13,350 --> 01:55:13,360
intuition building about Consciousness
 

5321
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:15,069
intuition building about Consciousness
or is this something that we're just

5322
01:55:15,069 --> 01:55:15,079
or is this something that we're just
 

5323
01:55:15,079 --> 01:55:17,750
or is this something that we're just
totally clueless about that this is uh

5324
01:55:17,750 --> 01:55:17,760
totally clueless about that this is uh
 

5325
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:21,390
totally clueless about that this is uh
let's focus on the the body the brain

5326
01:55:21,390 --> 01:55:21,400
let's focus on the the body the brain
 

5327
01:55:21,400 --> 01:55:24,069
let's focus on the the body the brain
listens to the body the body speaks to

5328
01:55:24,069 --> 01:55:24,079
listens to the body the body speaks to
 

5329
01:55:24,079 --> 01:55:26,189
listens to the body the body speaks to
the brain and like let's just figure

5330
01:55:26,189 --> 01:55:26,199
the brain and like let's just figure
 

5331
01:55:26,199 --> 01:55:28,030
the brain and like let's just figure
this piece out and then Consciousness

5332
01:55:28,030 --> 01:55:28,040
this piece out and then Consciousness
 

5333
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:30,669
this piece out and then Consciousness
will probably emerge somehow after that

5334
01:55:30,669 --> 01:55:30,679
will probably emerge somehow after that
 

5335
01:55:30,679 --> 01:55:33,229
will probably emerge somehow after that
no I think you know well first of all

5336
01:55:33,229 --> 01:55:33,239
no I think you know well first of all
 

5337
01:55:33,239 --> 01:55:36,350
no I think you know well first of all
it'll just say up front um I am not a

5338
01:55:36,350 --> 01:55:36,360
it'll just say up front um I am not a
 

5339
01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:38,149
it'll just say up front um I am not a
philosopher of Consciousness and I'm not

5340
01:55:38,149 --> 01:55:38,159
philosopher of Consciousness and I'm not
 

5341
01:55:38,159 --> 01:55:39,950
philosopher of Consciousness and I'm not
a neuroscientist who focuses on

5342
01:55:39,950 --> 01:55:39,960
a neuroscientist who focuses on
 

5343
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:41,550
a neuroscientist who focuses on
Consciousness I mean in some sense I do

5344
01:55:41,550 --> 01:55:41,560
Consciousness I mean in some sense I do
 

5345
01:55:41,560 --> 01:55:44,709
Consciousness I mean in some sense I do
study it because I study affect in mood

5346
01:55:44,709 --> 01:55:44,719
study it because I study affect in mood
 

5347
01:55:44,719 --> 01:55:48,149
study it because I study affect in mood
and that's that is the

5348
01:55:48,149 --> 01:55:48,159
and that's that is the
 

5349
01:55:48,159 --> 01:55:51,629
and that's that is the
um uh you know to use the phrase that is

5350
01:55:51,629 --> 01:55:51,639
um uh you know to use the phrase that is
 

5351
01:55:51,639 --> 01:55:53,470
um uh you know to use the phrase that is
the the hard question um of

5352
01:55:53,470 --> 01:55:53,480
the the hard question um of
 

5353
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:56,589
the the hard question um of
Consciousness how is it that your brain

5354
01:55:56,589 --> 01:55:56,599
Consciousness how is it that your brain
 

5355
01:55:56,599 --> 01:55:58,629
Consciousness how is it that your brain
is modeling your body your brain is

5356
01:55:58,629 --> 01:55:58,639
is modeling your body your brain is
 

5357
01:55:58,639 --> 01:56:00,350
is modeling your body your brain is
modeling the sensory conditions of your

5358
01:56:00,350 --> 01:56:00,360
modeling the sensory conditions of your
 

5359
01:56:00,360 --> 01:56:04,109
modeling the sensory conditions of your
body it's um and it's being updated that

5360
01:56:04,109 --> 01:56:04,119
body it's um and it's being updated that
 

5361
01:56:04,119 --> 01:56:06,589
body it's um and it's being updated that
model is being updated by the sense data

5362
01:56:06,589 --> 01:56:06,599
model is being updated by the sense data
 

5363
01:56:06,599 --> 01:56:08,189
model is being updated by the sense data
that's coming from your body and it's

5364
01:56:08,189 --> 01:56:08,199
that's coming from your body and it's
 

5365
01:56:08,199 --> 01:56:11,270
that's coming from your body and it's
happening continuously your whole life

5366
01:56:11,270 --> 01:56:11,280
happening continuously your whole life
 

5367
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:14,430
happening continuously your whole life
and you don't feel those Sensations

5368
01:56:14,430 --> 01:56:14,440
and you don't feel those Sensations
 

5369
01:56:14,440 --> 01:56:18,069
and you don't feel those Sensations
directly you what you feel is a general

5370
01:56:18,069 --> 01:56:18,079
directly you what you feel is a general
 

5371
01:56:18,079 --> 01:56:20,149
directly you what you feel is a general
sense of pleasantness or pleasantness

5372
01:56:20,149 --> 01:56:20,159
sense of pleasantness or pleasantness
 

5373
01:56:20,159 --> 01:56:21,950
sense of pleasantness or pleasantness
Comfort discomfort feeling worked up

5374
01:56:21,950 --> 01:56:21,960
Comfort discomfort feeling worked up
 

5375
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:24,510
Comfort discomfort feeling worked up
feeling calm so we call that affect you

5376
01:56:24,510 --> 01:56:24,520
feeling calm so we call that affect you
 

5377
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:27,149
feeling calm so we call that affect you
know most people call it mood so how is

5378
01:56:27,149 --> 01:56:27,159
know most people call it mood so how is
 

5379
01:56:27,159 --> 01:56:29,550
know most people call it mood so how is
it that your brain gives you this very

5380
01:56:29,550 --> 01:56:29,560
it that your brain gives you this very
 

5381
01:56:29,560 --> 01:56:32,990
it that your brain gives you this very
low dimensional feeling of mood or

5382
01:56:32,990 --> 01:56:33,000
low dimensional feeling of mood or
 

5383
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:36,149
low dimensional feeling of mood or
affect when it's presumably receiving a

5384
01:56:36,149 --> 01:56:36,159
affect when it's presumably receiving a
 

5385
01:56:36,159 --> 01:56:38,910
affect when it's presumably receiving a
very high-dimensional array of sense

5386
01:56:38,910 --> 01:56:38,920
very high-dimensional array of sense
 

5387
01:56:38,920 --> 01:56:40,990
very high-dimensional array of sense
data and the model that the brain is

5388
01:56:40,990 --> 01:56:41,000
data and the model that the brain is
 

5389
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:44,069
data and the model that the brain is
running of the body has to be high

5390
01:56:44,069 --> 01:56:44,079
running of the body has to be high
 

5391
01:56:44,079 --> 01:56:46,510
running of the body has to be high
dimensional because there's a lot going

5392
01:56:46,510 --> 01:56:46,520
dimensional because there's a lot going
 

5393
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:48,830
dimensional because there's a lot going
on in there right you're not aware but

5394
01:56:48,830 --> 01:56:48,840
on in there right you're not aware but
 

5395
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:50,270
on in there right you're not aware but
as you're sitting there there quietly as

5396
01:56:50,270 --> 01:56:50,280
as you're sitting there there quietly as
 

5397
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:53,229
as you're sitting there there quietly as
your listeners or our our as our viewers

5398
01:56:53,229 --> 01:56:53,239
your listeners or our our as our viewers
 

5399
01:56:53,239 --> 01:56:55,870
your listeners or our our as our viewers
are sitting um they might be working out

5400
01:56:55,870 --> 01:56:55,880
are sitting um they might be working out
 

5401
01:56:55,880 --> 01:56:58,149
are sitting um they might be working out
running now or as many of them right to

5402
01:56:58,149 --> 01:56:58,159
running now or as many of them right to
 

5403
01:56:58,159 --> 01:57:00,069
running now or as many of them right to
me they're laying in bed smoking weed

5404
01:57:00,069 --> 01:57:00,079
me they're laying in bed smoking weed
 

5405
01:57:00,079 --> 01:57:02,149
me they're laying in bed smoking weed
with their eyes closed and that's fair

5406
01:57:02,149 --> 01:57:02,159
with their eyes closed and that's fair
 

5407
01:57:02,159 --> 01:57:03,990
with their eyes closed and that's fair
so maybe we should say that bit again

5408
01:57:03,990 --> 01:57:04,000
so maybe we should say that bit again
 

5409
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:07,350
so maybe we should say that bit again
then so if so some people may be working

5410
01:57:07,350 --> 01:57:07,360
then so if so some people may be working
 

5411
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:11,790
then so if so some people may be working
out some people may be uh relaxing but

5412
01:57:11,790 --> 01:57:11,800
out some people may be uh relaxing but
 

5413
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:13,149
out some people may be uh relaxing but
you know even if you're sitting very

5414
01:57:13,149 --> 01:57:13,159
you know even if you're sitting very
 

5415
01:57:13,159 --> 01:57:15,350
you know even if you're sitting very
still while you're watching this or

5416
01:57:15,350 --> 01:57:15,360
still while you're watching this or
 

5417
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:17,669
still while you're watching this or
listening to this there's a whole drama

5418
01:57:17,669 --> 01:57:17,679
listening to this there's a whole drama
 

5419
01:57:17,679 --> 01:57:19,870
listening to this there's a whole drama
going on inside your body that you're

5420
01:57:19,870 --> 01:57:19,880
going on inside your body that you're
 

5421
01:57:19,880 --> 01:57:24,189
going on inside your body that you're
largely unaware of yet your brain makes

5422
01:57:24,189 --> 01:57:24,199
largely unaware of yet your brain makes
 

5423
01:57:24,199 --> 01:57:26,069
largely unaware of yet your brain makes
you

5424
01:57:26,069 --> 01:57:26,079
you
 

5425
01:57:26,079 --> 01:57:28,990
you
aware or gives you a status report in a

5426
01:57:28,990 --> 01:57:29,000
aware or gives you a status report in a
 

5427
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,550
aware or gives you a status report in a
sense by virtue of these mental features

5428
01:57:31,550 --> 01:57:31,560
sense by virtue of these mental features
 

5429
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:33,470
sense by virtue of these mental features
of feeling Pleasant feeling unpleasant

5430
01:57:33,470 --> 01:57:33,480
of feeling Pleasant feeling unpleasant
 

5431
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:34,629
of feeling Pleasant feeling unpleasant
feeling comfortable feeling

5432
01:57:34,629 --> 01:57:34,639
feeling comfortable feeling
 

5433
01:57:34,639 --> 01:57:36,669
feeling comfortable feeling
uncomfortable feeling energetic feeling

5434
01:57:36,669 --> 01:57:36,679
uncomfortable feeling energetic feeling
 

5435
01:57:36,679 --> 01:57:40,069
uncomfortable feeling energetic feeling
tired and so on and so how the hell is

5436
01:57:40,069 --> 01:57:40,079
tired and so on and so how the hell is
 

5437
01:57:40,079 --> 01:57:43,709
tired and so on and so how the hell is
it doing that that is the basic

5438
01:57:43,709 --> 01:57:43,719
it doing that that is the basic
 

5439
01:57:43,719 --> 01:57:46,910
it doing that that is the basic
question of of Consciousness and like

5440
01:57:46,910 --> 01:57:46,920
question of of Consciousness and like
 

5441
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:49,470
question of of Consciousness and like
the status reports seem to be in the the

5442
01:57:49,470 --> 01:57:49,480
the status reports seem to be in the the
 

5443
01:57:49,480 --> 01:57:51,550
the status reports seem to be in the the
way we experience them seem to be quite

5444
01:57:51,550 --> 01:57:51,560
way we experience them seem to be quite
 

5445
01:57:51,560 --> 01:57:53,229
way we experience them seem to be quite
simple

5446
01:57:53,229 --> 01:57:53,239
simple
 

5447
01:57:53,239 --> 01:57:55,390
simple
like it doesn't feel like there's a lot

5448
01:57:55,390 --> 01:57:55,400
like it doesn't feel like there's a lot
 

5449
01:57:55,400 --> 01:57:57,830
like it doesn't feel like there's a lot
of data yeah know that there isn't so

5450
01:57:57,830 --> 01:57:57,840
of data yeah know that there isn't so
 

5451
01:57:57,840 --> 01:57:58,910
of data yeah know that there isn't so
when you

5452
01:57:58,910 --> 01:57:58,920
when you
 

5453
01:57:58,920 --> 01:58:02,870
when you
feel when you feel um discomfort when

5454
01:58:02,870 --> 01:58:02,880
feel when you feel um discomfort when
 

5455
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:04,870
feel when you feel um discomfort when
you're feeling basically like you

5456
01:58:04,870 --> 01:58:04,880
you're feeling basically like you
 

5457
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:06,950
you're feeling basically like you
feel like what does that tell you

5458
01:58:06,950 --> 01:58:06,960
feel like what does that tell you
 

5459
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:08,350
feel like what does that tell you
like what are you supposed to do next

5460
01:58:08,350 --> 01:58:08,360
like what are you supposed to do next
 

5461
01:58:08,360 --> 01:58:10,589
like what are you supposed to do next
what caused it I mean the thing is not

5462
01:58:10,589 --> 01:58:10,599
what caused it I mean the thing is not
 

5463
01:58:10,599 --> 01:58:13,430
what caused it I mean the thing is not
one thing caused it right it's multiple

5464
01:58:13,430 --> 01:58:13,440
one thing caused it right it's multiple
 

5465
01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:16,109
one thing caused it right it's multiple
factors probably influencing your

5466
01:58:16,109 --> 01:58:16,119
factors probably influencing your
 

5467
01:58:16,119 --> 01:58:17,990
factors probably influencing your
physical state your body very high

5468
01:58:17,990 --> 01:58:18,000
physical state your body very high
 

5469
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,790
physical state your body very high
dimensional yeah very high dimensional

5470
01:58:20,790 --> 01:58:20,800
dimensional yeah very high dimensional
 

5471
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:22,430
dimensional yeah very high dimensional
um

5472
01:58:22,430 --> 01:58:22,440
um
 

5473
01:58:22,440 --> 01:58:26,109
um
and that and the there are different

5474
01:58:26,109 --> 01:58:26,119
and that and the there are different
 

5475
01:58:26,119 --> 01:58:29,430
and that and the there are different
temporal scales of influence right so um

5476
01:58:29,430 --> 01:58:29,440
temporal scales of influence right so um
 

5477
01:58:29,440 --> 01:58:32,430
temporal scales of influence right so um
it you know the state of your gut is not

5478
01:58:32,430 --> 01:58:32,440
it you know the state of your gut is not
 

5479
01:58:32,440 --> 01:58:33,990
it you know the state of your gut is not
just influenced by what you ate five

5480
01:58:33,990 --> 01:58:34,000
just influenced by what you ate five
 

5481
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,310
just influenced by what you ate five
minutes ago it's also what you ate a day

5482
01:58:36,310 --> 01:58:36,320
minutes ago it's also what you ate a day
 

5483
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:42,030
minutes ago it's also what you ate a day
ago and two days ago and and so on so um

5484
01:58:42,030 --> 01:58:42,040
ago and two days ago and and so on so um
 

5485
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:43,910
ago and two days ago and and so on so um
so I

5486
01:58:43,910 --> 01:58:43,920
so I
 

5487
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:48,229
so I
think the you know when I'm I'm not

5488
01:58:48,229 --> 01:58:48,239
think the you know when I'm I'm not
 

5489
01:58:48,239 --> 01:58:50,470
think the you know when I'm I'm not
trying to weasle out of the question I

5490
01:58:50,470 --> 01:58:50,480
trying to weasle out of the question I
 

5491
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:53,870
trying to weasle out of the question I
just think it's a it's the hardest

5492
01:58:53,870 --> 01:58:53,880
just think it's a it's the hardest
 

5493
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:55,589
just think it's a it's the hardest
question actually do you think we'll

5494
01:58:55,589 --> 01:58:55,599
question actually do you think we'll
 

5495
01:58:55,599 --> 01:58:58,990
question actually do you think we'll
ever understand

5496
01:58:58,990 --> 01:58:59,000

 

5497
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,550

it

5498
01:59:00,550 --> 01:59:00,560
it
 

5499
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:02,350
it
um as

5500
01:59:02,350 --> 01:59:02,360
um as
 

5501
01:59:02,360 --> 01:59:05,109
um as
scientists I think that we

5502
01:59:05,109 --> 01:59:05,119
scientists I think that we
 

5503
01:59:05,119 --> 01:59:08,270
scientists I think that we
will understand it as well as we

5504
01:59:08,270 --> 01:59:08,280
will understand it as well as we
 

5505
01:59:08,280 --> 01:59:11,750
will understand it as well as we
understand other things like um the

5506
01:59:11,750 --> 01:59:11,760
understand other things like um the
 

5507
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:15,270
understand other things like um the
birth of the universe or the you know

5508
01:59:15,270 --> 01:59:15,280
birth of the universe or the you know
 

5509
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:17,350
birth of the universe or the you know
the nature of the of the Universe I

5510
01:59:17,350 --> 01:59:17,360
the nature of the of the Universe I
 

5511
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:19,430
the nature of the of the Universe I
guess I I would say so I do I think we

5512
01:59:19,430 --> 01:59:19,440
guess I I would say so I do I think we
 

5513
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:22,470
guess I I would say so I do I think we
get to that level of an explanation I do

5514
01:59:22,470 --> 01:59:22,480
get to that level of an explanation I do
 

5515
01:59:22,480 --> 01:59:24,030
get to that level of an explanation I do
actually but I think that we have to

5516
01:59:24,030 --> 01:59:24,040
actually but I think that we have to
 

5517
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:25,589
actually but I think that we have to
start asking somewhat different

5518
01:59:25,589 --> 01:59:25,599
start asking somewhat different
 

5519
01:59:25,599 --> 01:59:28,069
start asking somewhat different
questions and approaching the science

5520
01:59:28,069 --> 01:59:28,079
questions and approaching the science
 

5521
01:59:28,079 --> 01:59:29,790
questions and approaching the science
somewhat differently than we have in the

5522
01:59:29,790 --> 01:59:29,800
somewhat differently than we have in the
 

5523
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:31,390
somewhat differently than we have in the
past I mean it's also possible that

5524
01:59:31,390 --> 01:59:31,400
past I mean it's also possible that
 

5525
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:33,270
past I mean it's also possible that
Consciousness is much more difficult to

5526
01:59:33,270 --> 01:59:33,280
Consciousness is much more difficult to
 

5527
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:34,470
Consciousness is much more difficult to
understand than the nature of the

5528
01:59:34,470 --> 01:59:34,480
understand than the nature of the
 

5529
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:36,709
understand than the nature of the
universe it is but I I wasn't

5530
01:59:36,709 --> 01:59:36,719
universe it is but I I wasn't
 

5531
01:59:36,719 --> 01:59:38,430
universe it is but I I wasn't
necessarily saying that it was a

5532
01:59:38,430 --> 01:59:38,440
necessarily saying that it was a
 

5533
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:40,109
necessarily saying that it was a
question that was of equivalent

5534
01:59:40,109 --> 01:59:40,119
question that was of equivalent
 

5535
01:59:40,119 --> 01:59:42,390
question that was of equivalent
complexity I was saying that I do think

5536
01:59:42,390 --> 01:59:42,400
complexity I was saying that I do think
 

5537
01:59:42,400 --> 01:59:44,830
complexity I was saying that I do think
that we could get

5538
01:59:44,830 --> 01:59:44,840
that we could get
 

5539
01:59:44,840 --> 01:59:46,550
that we could get
to

5540
01:59:46,550 --> 01:59:46,560
to
 

5541
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:50,069
to
some I I am optimistic that I I would

5542
01:59:50,069 --> 01:59:50,079
some I I am optimistic that I I would
 

5543
01:59:50,079 --> 01:59:53,750
some I I am optimistic that I I would
not I would be very willing to invest my

5544
01:59:53,750 --> 01:59:53,760
not I would be very willing to invest my
 

5545
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:56,390
not I would be very willing to invest my
the time my time on this Earth as a

5546
01:59:56,390 --> 01:59:56,400
the time my time on this Earth as a
 

5547
01:59:56,400 --> 01:59:57,990
the time my time on this Earth as a
scientist in trying to answer that

5548
01:59:57,990 --> 01:59:58,000
scientist in trying to answer that
 

5549
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,430
scientist in trying to answer that
question if I could do it the way that I

5550
02:00:00,430 --> 02:00:00,440
question if I could do it the way that I
 

5551
02:00:00,440 --> 02:00:02,870
question if I could do it the way that I
want to do it um not the way that it's

5552
02:00:02,870 --> 02:00:02,880
want to do it um not the way that it's
 

5553
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:05,550
want to do it um not the way that it's
currently being done so like

5554
02:00:05,550 --> 02:00:05,560
currently being done so like
 

5555
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:07,589
currently being done so like
rigorously I don't want to say unrig

5556
02:00:07,589 --> 02:00:07,599
rigorously I don't want to say unrig
 

5557
02:00:07,599 --> 02:00:09,069
rigorously I don't want to say unrig
usly I just want to say that there are

5558
02:00:09,069 --> 02:00:09,079
usly I just want to say that there are
 

5559
02:00:09,079 --> 02:00:11,189
usly I just want to say that there are
certain set of assumptions that you know

5560
02:00:11,189 --> 02:00:11,199
certain set of assumptions that you know
 

5561
02:00:11,199 --> 02:00:13,390
certain set of assumptions that you know
scientists have what I would call

5562
02:00:13,390 --> 02:00:13,400
scientists have what I would call
 

5563
02:00:13,400 --> 02:00:14,870
scientists have what I would call
ontological commitments they're

5564
02:00:14,870 --> 02:00:14,880
ontological commitments they're
 

5565
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:17,030
ontological commitments they're
commitments about the way the world is

5566
02:00:17,030 --> 02:00:17,040
commitments about the way the world is
 

5567
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:19,830
commitments about the way the world is
or the way that nature is

5568
02:00:19,830 --> 02:00:19,840
or the way that nature is
 

5569
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:22,550
or the way that nature is
and they these commitments lead

5570
02:00:22,550 --> 02:00:22,560
and they these commitments lead
 

5571
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:24,910
and they these commitments lead
scientists sometimes blindly without

02:00:24,910 --> 02:00:24,920
scientists sometimes blindly without
 

5573
02:00:24,920 --> 02:00:26,149
scientists sometimes blindly without
they don't scientists sometimes

02:00:26,149 --> 02:00:26,159
they don't scientists sometimes
 

5575
02:00:26,159 --> 02:00:27,390
they don't scientists sometimes
sometimes scientists are aware of these

5576
02:00:27,390 --> 02:00:27,400
sometimes scientists are aware of these
 

5577
02:00:27,400 --> 02:00:29,350
sometimes scientists are aware of these

how what they measure how they measure

5584
02:00:36,790 --> 02:00:36,800
how what they measure how they measure
 

5585
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:40,069
how what they measure how they measure
and I I just have very different views

5586
02:00:40,069 --> 02:00:40,079
and I I just have very different views
 

5587
02:00:40,079 --> 02:00:42,669
and I I just have very different views
than a lot of my colleagues about the

5588
02:00:42,669 --> 02:00:42,679
than a lot of my colleagues about the
 

5589
02:00:42,679 --> 02:00:45,270
than a lot of my colleagues about the
ways to approach this not everybody but

5590
02:00:45,270 --> 02:00:45,280
ways to approach this not everybody but
 

5591
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:46,950
ways to approach this not everybody but
um but the way that I would approach it

5592
02:00:46,950 --> 02:00:46,960
um but the way that I would approach it
 

5593
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:50,069
um but the way that I would approach it
would be different and it would cost

5594
02:00:50,069 --> 02:00:50,079
would be different and it would cost
 

5595
02:00:50,079 --> 02:00:53,750
would be different and it would cost
more and it would take longer it doesn't

5596
02:00:53,750 --> 02:00:53,760
more and it would take longer it doesn't

structure of Science and so do I think

5600
02:00:58,430 --> 02:00:58,440
structure of Science and so do I think
 

5601
02:00:58,440 --> 02:01:00,310
structure of Science and so do I think
that doing science the way science is

5602
02:01:00,310 --> 02:01:00,320
that doing science the way science is
 

5603
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:01,950
that doing science the way science is
currently done with the budget that it

5604
02:01:01,950 --> 02:01:01,960
currently done with the budget that it
 

5605
02:01:01,960 --> 02:01:03,470

currently has and the incentive
 

5607
02:01:03,480 --> 02:01:05,069
currently has and the incentive
structure that it currently has will we

5608
02:01:05,069 --> 02:01:05,079
structure that it currently has will we
 

5609
02:01:05,079 --> 02:01:07,270
structure that it currently has will we
have an answer no I think absolutely not

5610
02:01:07,270 --> 02:01:07,280
have an answer no I think absolutely not

and
 

5667
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:24,870
and
um population thinking as opposed to

um population thinking as opposed to
 

5669
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:27,109
um population thinking as opposed to
essentialism so this idea essentialism

5670
02:02:27,109 --> 02:02:27,119
essentialism so this idea essentialism
 

5671
02:02:27,119 --> 02:02:29,109
essentialism so this idea essentialism
is this idea that you know there's an

any given moment it's good title for
 

5695
02:02:58,079 --> 02:02:59,790
any given moment it's good title for
that triple helix so playing on the

5696
02:02:59,790 --> 02:02:59,800
that triple helix so playing on the
 

5697
02:02:59,800 --> 02:03:02,109
that triple helix so playing on the
double helix where it's just the biology

5698
02:03:02,109 --> 02:03:02,119
double helix where it's just the biology
 

5699
02:03:02,119 --> 02:03:05,310
double helix where it's just the biology
it's bigger than the biology exactly um

5700
02:03:05,310 --> 02:03:05,320
it's bigger than the biology exactly um
 

5701
02:03:05,320 --> 02:03:06,750
it's bigger than the biology exactly um
It's a Wonderful book I've read it

5702
02:03:06,750 --> 02:03:06,760
It's a Wonderful book I've read it
 

5703
02:03:06,760 --> 02:03:08,510
It's a Wonderful book I've read it
probably six or seven times throughout

5704
02:03:08,510 --> 02:03:08,520
probably six or seven times throughout
 

5705
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:10,709
probably six or seven times throughout
the year he has another book too which

5706
02:03:10,709 --> 02:03:10,719
the year he has another book too which
 

5707
02:03:10,719 --> 02:03:13,669
the year he has another book too which
is it's more I think scientists would

5708
02:03:13,669 --> 02:03:13,679
is it's more I think scientists would
 

5709
02:03:13,679 --> 02:03:15,709
is it's more I think scientists would
find it I don't know I've loved it it's

5710
02:03:15,709 --> 02:03:15,719
find it I don't know I've loved it it's
 

5711
02:03:15,719 --> 02:03:17,470
find it I don't know I've loved it it's
called biology as

5712
02:03:17,470 --> 02:03:17,480
called biology as
 

5713
02:03:17,480 --> 02:03:21,109
called biology as
ideology and it is all about I wouldn't

5714
02:03:21,109 --> 02:03:21,119
ideology and it is all about I wouldn't
 

5715
02:03:21,119 --> 02:03:22,510
ideology and it is all about I wouldn't
call it one of the best books of all

5716
02:03:22,510 --> 02:03:22,520
call it one of the best books of all
 

5717
02:03:22,520 --> 02:03:24,990
call it one of the best books of all
time but I I love the book because it

5718
02:03:24,990 --> 02:03:25,000
time but I I love the book because it
 

5719
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:26,589
time but I I love the book because it
really does point

5720
02:03:26,589 --> 02:03:26,599
really does point
 

5721
02:03:26,599 --> 02:03:30,750
really does point
out you know that SC science as it's

5722
02:03:30,750 --> 02:03:30,760
out you know that SC science as it's
 

5723
02:03:30,760 --> 02:03:32,069
out you know that SC science as it's
currently practiced I mean the book was

5724
02:03:32,069 --> 02:03:32,079
currently practiced I mean the book was
 

5725
02:03:32,079 --> 02:03:33,950
currently practiced I mean the book was
written in 1991 but it actually I think

5726
02:03:33,950 --> 02:03:33,960
written in 1991 but it actually I think
 

5727
02:03:33,960 --> 02:03:36,109
written in 1991 but it actually I think
still holds that scientist science as

5728
02:03:36,109 --> 02:03:36,119
still holds that scientist science as
 

5729
02:03:36,119 --> 02:03:37,430
still holds that scientist science as
currently practice has a set of

5730
02:03:37,430 --> 02:03:37,440
currently practice has a set of
 

5731
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:39,109
currently practice has a set of
ontological commitments which are

5732
02:03:39,109 --> 02:03:39,119
ontological commitments which are
 

5733
02:03:39,119 --> 02:03:40,470
ontological commitments which are
somewhat

5734
02:03:40,470 --> 02:03:40,480
somewhat
 

5735
02:03:40,480 --> 02:03:42,589
somewhat
problematic so the assumptions are

5736
02:03:42,589 --> 02:03:42,599
problematic so the assumptions are
 

5737
02:03:42,599 --> 02:03:45,189
problematic so the assumptions are
limiting yeah in ways that you it's you

5738
02:03:45,189 --> 02:03:45,199
limiting yeah in ways that you it's you
 

5739
02:03:45,199 --> 02:03:46,709
limiting yeah in ways that you it's you
know it's like you're a fish in water

5740
02:03:46,709 --> 02:03:46,719
know it's like you're a fish in water
 

5741
02:03:46,719 --> 02:03:49,229
know it's like you're a fish in water
and you don't like okay so yeah so here

5742
02:03:49,229 --> 02:03:49,239
and you don't like okay so yeah so here
 

5743
02:03:49,239 --> 02:03:51,270
and you don't like okay so yeah so here
Foster walls stuff but but you know but

5744
02:03:51,270 --> 02:03:51,280
Foster walls stuff but but you know but
 

5745
02:03:51,280 --> 02:03:52,790
Foster walls stuff but but you know but
here's a here's a really cool thing I

5746
02:03:52,790 --> 02:03:52,800
here's a here's a really cool thing I
 

5747
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:56,189
here's a here's a really cool thing I
just learned recently is it okay just to

5748
02:03:56,189 --> 02:03:56,199
just learned recently is it okay just to
 

5749
02:03:56,199 --> 02:03:57,629
just learned recently is it okay just to
to to go off on this tangent for a

5750
02:03:57,629 --> 02:03:57,639
to to go off on this tangent for a
 

5751
02:03:57,639 --> 02:03:59,430
to to go off on this tangent for a
minute yeah yeah that's called tangent

5752
02:03:59,430 --> 02:03:59,440
minute yeah yeah that's called tangent
 

5753
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:01,229
minute yeah yeah that's called tangent
great okay um I was just going to say

5754
02:04:01,229 --> 02:04:01,239
great okay um I was just going to say
 

5755
02:04:01,239 --> 02:04:02,790
great okay um I was just going to say
that I just learned recently that we

5756
02:04:02,790 --> 02:04:02,800
that I just learned recently that we
 

5757
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:06,069
that I just learned recently that we
don't have water receptors on our skin

5758
02:04:06,069 --> 02:04:06,079
don't have water receptors on our skin
 

5759
02:04:06,079 --> 02:04:07,629
don't have water receptors on our skin
so how do you know when you're sweating

5760
02:04:07,629 --> 02:04:07,639
so how do you know when you're sweating
 

5761
02:04:07,639 --> 02:04:10,589
so how do you know when you're sweating
how do you know when when a raindrop

5762
02:04:10,589 --> 02:04:10,599
how do you know when when a raindrop
 

5763
02:04:10,599 --> 02:04:11,950
how do you know when when a raindrop
when you know when it's going to rain

5764
02:04:11,950 --> 02:04:11,960
when you know when it's going to rain
 

5765
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:13,430
when you know when it's going to rain
and you know like a raindrop hits your

5766
02:04:13,430 --> 02:04:13,440
and you know like a raindrop hits your
 

5767
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:15,990
and you know like a raindrop hits your
skin and you can feel that little drop

5768
02:04:15,990 --> 02:04:16,000
skin and you can feel that little drop
 

5769
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,709
skin and you can feel that little drop
of wetness how is it that you feel that

5770
02:04:17,709 --> 02:04:17,719
of wetness how is it that you feel that
 

5771
02:04:17,719 --> 02:04:20,709
of wetness how is it that you feel that
drop of wetness when we don't have water

5772
02:04:20,709 --> 02:04:20,719
drop of wetness when we don't have water
 

5773
02:04:20,719 --> 02:04:23,229
drop of wetness when we don't have water
receptors in our skin and I was when I

5774
02:04:23,229 --> 02:04:23,239
receptors in our skin and I was when I
 

5775
02:04:23,239 --> 02:04:26,109
receptors in our skin and I was when I
my mind is blown already yeah that was

5776
02:04:26,109 --> 02:04:26,119
my mind is blown already yeah that was
 

5777
02:04:26,119 --> 02:04:28,549
my mind is blown already yeah that was
my reaction too right I was like of

5778
02:04:28,549 --> 02:04:28,559
my reaction too right I was like of
 

5779
02:04:28,559 --> 02:04:30,109
my reaction too right I was like of
course we don't because we evolved in

5780
02:04:30,109 --> 02:04:30,119
course we don't because we evolved in
 

5781
02:04:30,119 --> 02:04:32,430
course we don't because we evolved in
the water yeah like why would we need

5782
02:04:32,430 --> 02:04:32,440
the water yeah like why would we need
 

5783
02:04:32,440 --> 02:04:34,109
the water yeah like why would we need
you know it just it was just this like

5784
02:04:34,109 --> 02:04:34,119
you know it just it was just this like
 

5785
02:04:34,119 --> 02:04:35,149
you know it just it was just this like
you know you have these moments where

5786
02:04:35,149 --> 02:04:35,159
you know you have these moments where
 

5787
02:04:35,159 --> 02:04:37,669
you know you have these moments where
you're like of course there's like a

5788
02:04:37,669 --> 02:04:37,679
you're like of course there's like a
 

5789
02:04:37,679 --> 02:04:39,549
you're like of course there's like a
yeah so you'll never see rain the same

5790
02:04:39,549 --> 02:04:39,559
yeah so you'll never see rain the same
 

5791
02:04:39,559 --> 02:04:42,510
yeah so you'll never see rain the same
way again so the answer is it's a it's a

5792
02:04:42,510 --> 02:04:42,520
way again so the answer is it's a it's a
 

5793
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:46,589
way again so the answer is it's a it's a
it's a combination of um temperature and

5794
02:04:46,589 --> 02:04:46,599
it's a combination of um temperature and
 

5795
02:04:46,599 --> 02:04:49,270
it's a combination of um temperature and
touch yeah but it's a complex

5796
02:04:49,270 --> 02:04:49,280
touch yeah but it's a complex
 

5797
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:52,430
touch yeah but it's a complex
sense that's only computed in your brain

5798
02:04:52,430 --> 02:04:52,440
sense that's only computed in your brain
 

5799
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:55,549
sense that's only computed in your brain
there's no receptor for it anyways yeah

5800
02:04:55,549 --> 02:04:55,559
there's no receptor for it anyways yeah
 

5801
02:04:55,559 --> 02:04:58,350
there's no receptor for it anyways yeah
that's why like snow versus cold rain

5802
02:04:58,350 --> 02:04:58,360
that's why like snow versus cold rain
 

5803
02:04:58,360 --> 02:05:00,430
that's why like snow versus cold rain
versus warm rain all feel different

5804
02:05:00,430 --> 02:05:00,440
versus warm rain all feel different
 

5805
02:05:00,440 --> 02:05:01,910
versus warm rain all feel different
because you're you're trying to infer

5806
02:05:01,910 --> 02:05:01,920
because you're you're trying to infer
 

5807
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:04,069
because you're you're trying to infer
stuff from the temperature and the size

5808
02:05:04,069 --> 02:05:04,079
stuff from the temperature and the size
 

5809
02:05:04,079 --> 02:05:06,109
stuff from the temperature and the size
of the droplet it's fascinating yeah

5810
02:05:06,109 --> 02:05:06,119
of the droplet it's fascinating yeah
 

5811
02:05:06,119 --> 02:05:07,950
of the droplet it's fascinating yeah
your brain is a prediction machine it's

5812
02:05:07,950 --> 02:05:07,960
your brain is a prediction machine it's
 

5813
02:05:07,960 --> 02:05:10,310
your brain is a prediction machine it's
using lots and lots of information

5814
02:05:10,310 --> 02:05:10,320
using lots and lots of information
 

5815
02:05:10,320 --> 02:05:14,069
using lots and lots of information
combining it you know anyway so but um

5816
02:05:14,069 --> 02:05:14,079
combining it you know anyway so but um
 

5817
02:05:14,079 --> 02:05:17,669
combining it you know anyway so but um
so biology's ideology is I wouldn't say

5818
02:05:17,669 --> 02:05:17,679
so biology's ideology is I wouldn't say
 

5819
02:05:17,679 --> 02:05:18,790
so biology's ideology is I wouldn't say
it's one of the greatest books of all

5820
02:05:18,790 --> 02:05:18,800
it's one of the greatest books of all
 

5821
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:21,750
it's one of the greatest books of all
time but it is a it is a really useful

5822
02:05:21,750 --> 02:05:21,760
time but it is a it is a really useful
 

5823
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:24,470
time but it is a it is a really useful
book there's a book by um if you're

5824
02:05:24,470 --> 02:05:24,480
book there's a book by um if you're
 

5825
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:26,430
book there's a book by um if you're
interested in Psychology or the mind at

5826
02:05:26,430 --> 02:05:26,440
interested in Psychology or the mind at
 

5827
02:05:26,440 --> 02:05:29,030
interested in Psychology or the mind at
all there's a wonderful book A little

5828
02:05:29,030 --> 02:05:29,040
all there's a wonderful book A little
 

5829
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:32,950
all there's a wonderful book A little
it's a it's a fairly fairly small book

5830
02:05:32,950 --> 02:05:32,960
it's a it's a fairly fairly small book
 

5831
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:36,149
it's a it's a fairly fairly small book
called naming the Mind by Kurt danziger

5832
02:05:36,149 --> 02:05:36,159
called naming the Mind by Kurt danziger
 

5833
02:05:36,159 --> 02:05:37,549
called naming the Mind by Kurt danziger
who's a historian of

5834
02:05:37,549 --> 02:05:37,559
who's a historian of
 

5835
02:05:37,559 --> 02:05:40,589
who's a historian of
psychology everybody in my lab reads

5836
02:05:40,589 --> 02:05:40,599
psychology everybody in my lab reads
 

5837
02:05:40,599 --> 02:05:43,910
psychology everybody in my lab reads
both of these books so what was the book

5838
02:05:43,910 --> 02:05:43,920
both of these books so what was the book
 

5839
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:46,109
both of these books so what was the book
it's about the origin of the where do

5840
02:05:46,109 --> 02:05:46,119
it's about the origin of the where do
 

5841
02:05:46,119 --> 02:05:48,390
it's about the origin of the where do
where did we get the theory of mind that

5842
02:05:48,390 --> 02:05:48,400
where did we get the theory of mind that
 

5843
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:51,390
where did we get the theory of mind that
we had have that uh the human mind is

5844
02:05:51,390 --> 02:05:51,400
we had have that uh the human mind is
 

5845
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:53,950
we had have that uh the human mind is
populated by thoughts and feelings

5846
02:05:53,950 --> 02:05:53,960
populated by thoughts and feelings
 

5847
02:05:53,960 --> 02:05:56,830
populated by thoughts and feelings
and um perceptions and where did those

5848
02:05:56,830 --> 02:05:56,840
and um perceptions and where did those
 

5849
02:05:56,840 --> 02:05:59,030
and um perceptions and where did those
categories come from because they don't

5850
02:05:59,030 --> 02:05:59,040
categories come from because they don't
 

5851
02:05:59,040 --> 02:06:00,589
categories come from because they don't
exist in all

5852
02:06:00,589 --> 02:06:00,599
exist in all

danzinger is a the

5866
02:06:19,310 --> 02:06:19,320
danzinger is a the
 

5867
02:06:19,320 --> 02:06:23,510
danzinger is a the
opening chapter in that book

5868
02:06:23,510 --> 02:06:23,520
opening chapter in that book
 

5869
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:28,350
opening chapter in that book
is absolutely mind-blowing I love it I

5870
02:06:28,350 --> 02:06:28,360
is absolutely mind-blowing I love it I
 

5871
02:06:28,360 --> 02:06:32,030
is absolutely mind-blowing I love it I
love it I just think it's fantastic um

5872
02:06:32,030 --> 02:06:32,040
love it I just think it's fantastic um
 

5873
02:06:32,040 --> 02:06:36,030
love it I just think it's fantastic um
and I would say the there are many many

5874
02:06:36,030 --> 02:06:36,040
and I would say the there are many many
 

5875
02:06:36,040 --> 02:06:37,950
and I would say the there are many many
popular science books that I could

5876
02:06:37,950 --> 02:06:37,960
popular science books that I could
 

5877
02:06:37,960 --> 02:06:40,470
popular science books that I could
recommend that I think are extremely

5878
02:06:40,470 --> 02:06:40,480
recommend that I think are extremely
 

5879
02:06:40,480 --> 02:06:42,950
recommend that I think are extremely
well written in their own way you know

5880
02:06:42,950 --> 02:06:42,960
well written in their own way you know
 

5881
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:45,030
well written in their own way you know
before I maybe I said this to you but

5882
02:06:45,030 --> 02:06:45,040
before I maybe I said this to you but
 

5883
02:06:45,040 --> 02:06:47,430
before I maybe I said this to you but
before I undertook writing how motions

5884
02:06:47,430 --> 02:06:47,440
before I undertook writing how motions
 

5885
02:06:47,440 --> 02:06:50,430
before I undertook writing how motions
are made um I read I don't know

5886
02:06:50,430 --> 02:06:50,440
are made um I read I don't know
 

5887
02:06:50,440 --> 02:06:52,910
are made um I read I don't know
somewhere on the order of 50 or

5888
02:06:52,910 --> 02:06:52,920
somewhere on the order of 50 or
 

5889
02:06:52,920 --> 02:06:55,790
somewhere on the order of 50 or
60 uh popular science books to try to

5890
02:06:55,790 --> 02:06:55,800
60 uh popular science books to try to
 

5891
02:06:55,800 --> 02:06:57,470
60 uh popular science books to try to
figure out

5892
02:06:57,470 --> 02:06:57,480
figure out
 

5893
02:06:57,480 --> 02:07:00,510
figure out
how to write a popular science book

5894
02:07:00,510 --> 02:07:00,520
how to write a popular science book
 

5895
02:07:00,520 --> 02:07:03,189
how to write a popular science book
because while there are many books about

5896
02:07:03,189 --> 02:07:03,199
because while there are many books about
 

5897
02:07:03,199 --> 02:07:05,990
because while there are many books about
writing Stephen King has a great book

writing Stephen King has a great book
 

5899
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,669
writing Stephen King has a great book
writing on writing and um you know where

writing on writing and um you know where
 

5901
02:07:08,679 --> 02:07:12,109
writing on writing and um you know where
he gives tips um interlaced with his own

he gives tips um interlaced with his own
 

5903
02:07:12,119 --> 02:07:15,069
he gives tips um interlaced with his own
personal history um that was where I

5904
02:07:15,069 --> 02:07:15,079
personal history um that was where I
 

5905
02:07:15,079 --> 02:07:17,350
personal history um that was where I
learned you write for a specific person

5906
02:07:17,350 --> 02:07:17,360
learned you write for a specific person
 

5907
02:07:17,360 --> 02:07:19,510
learned you write for a specific person
you have a specific person in mind and

popular science books like what you
 

5917
02:07:28,360 --> 02:07:31,790
popular science books like what you
learn from that uh search because there

5918

5921
02:07:34,760 --> 02:07:36,510
there's uh I have some for me some
popular science books like I just roll

5922
02:07:36,510 --> 02:07:36,520
popular science books like I just roll
 

5923
02:07:36,520 --> 02:07:38,109
popular science books like I just roll
my eyes like this is

5924
02:07:38,109 --> 02:07:38,119
my eyes like this is
 

5925
02:07:38,119 --> 02:07:41,750
my eyes like this is
too um it's like same with TED talks

5926
02:07:41,750 --> 02:07:41,760
too um it's like same with TED talks
 

5927
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:44,149
too um it's like same with TED talks
like some of them go too much into the

5928
02:07:44,149 --> 02:07:44,159
like some of them go too much into the
 

5929
02:07:44,159 --> 02:07:46,910
like some of them go too much into the
flowery and don't I don't I would say

5930
02:07:46,910 --> 02:07:46,920
flowery and don't I don't I would say
 

5931

don't give enough respect to the
 

5933
02:07:49,119 --> 02:07:52,470
don't give enough respect to the
intelligence of the reader uh and but

intelligence of the reader uh and but
 

5935
02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:54,950
intelligence of the reader uh and but
that's this is my own bias very specific

a cinematic lecture of how emotions are
 

5945
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:11,790
a cinematic lecture of how emotions are
made that we wrote together with Joseph

5946
02:08:11,790 --> 02:08:11,800
made that we wrote together with Joseph
 

5947

but um I remember it's the memories are
 

5955
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:23,790
but um I remember it's the memories are
in there somewhere yeah it's from many

5956
02:08:23,790 --> 02:08:23,800
in there somewhere yeah it's from many
 

5957
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:26,470
in there somewhere yeah it's from many
many many generations ago um well half

5958
02:08:26,470 --> 02:08:26,480
many many generations ago um well half

[Music]
 

5973
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:47,870
[Music]
um you know videos and lectures that are

5974
02:08:47,870 --> 02:08:47,880
um you know videos and lectures that are
 

5975
02:08:47,880 --> 02:08:51,189
um you know videos and lectures that are
beautiful and educational and that

5976
02:08:51,189 --> 02:08:51,199
beautiful and educational and that
 

5977
02:08:51,199 --> 02:08:56,149
beautiful and educational and that
don't um don't dumb the material down um

5978
02:08:56,149 --> 02:08:56,159
don't um don't dumb the material down um
 

5979
02:08:56,159 --> 02:08:58,669
don't um don't dumb the material down um
and he's really remarkable at it

5980
02:08:58,669 --> 02:08:58,679
and he's really remarkable at it
 

5981
02:08:58,679 --> 02:09:01,709
and he's really remarkable at it
actually I mean just uh but again you

5982
02:09:01,709 --> 02:09:01,719
actually I mean just uh but again you
 

5983
02:09:01,719 --> 02:09:03,390
actually I mean just uh but again you
know that's that that requires a bit of

5984
02:09:03,390 --> 02:09:03,400
know that's that that requires a bit of
 

5985
02:09:03,400 --> 02:09:04,790
know that's that that requires a bit of
a paradigm shift we could have a whole

5986
02:09:04,790 --> 02:09:04,800
a paradigm shift we could have a whole
 

5987
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:07,510
a paradigm shift we could have a whole
conversation about the split between

5988
02:09:07,510 --> 02:09:07,520
conversation about the split between
 

5989
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:09,310
conversation about the split between
entertainment and education in this

5990
02:09:09,310 --> 02:09:09,320
entertainment and education in this
 

5991
02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:11,910
entertainment and education in this
country and why it is the way it is but

5992
02:09:11,910 --> 02:09:11,920
country and why it is the way it is but
 

5993
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:13,470
country and why it is the way it is but
that's a that's another conversation to

5994
02:09:13,470 --> 02:09:13,480
that's a that's another conversation to
 

5995
02:09:13,480 --> 02:09:15,750
that's a that's another conversation to
be continued but I would say the if I

5996
02:09:15,750 --> 02:09:15,760
be continued but I would say the if I
 

5997
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:18,870
be continued but I would say the if I
were to pick one book that I think is a

5998
02:09:18,870 --> 02:09:18,880
were to pick one book that I think is a
 

5999
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:21,549
were to pick one book that I think is a
really good example of good science

6000
02:09:21,549 --> 02:09:21,559
really good example of good science
 

6001
02:09:21,559 --> 02:09:24,629
really good example of good science
writing it would be the beak of the

6002
02:09:24,629 --> 02:09:24,639
writing it would be the beak of the
 

6003
02:09:24,639 --> 02:09:28,069
writing it would be the beak of the
finch which is one of it won a a pullit

6004
02:09:28,069 --> 02:09:28,079
finch which is one of it won a a pullit
 

6005
02:09:28,079 --> 02:09:31,430
finch which is one of it won a a pullit
Sur prise a number of years ago and I'm

6006
02:09:31,430 --> 02:09:31,440
Sur prise a number of years ago and I'm
 

6007
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:33,510
Sur prise a number of years ago and I'm
not I'm the I'm not remembering the

6008
02:09:33,510 --> 02:09:33,520
not I'm the I'm not remembering the
 

6009
02:09:33,520 --> 02:09:37,149
not I'm the I'm not remembering the
author's name I'm blanking um but the

6010
02:09:37,149 --> 02:09:37,159
author's name I'm blanking um but the
 

6011
02:09:37,159 --> 02:09:40,189
author's name I'm blanking um but the
I'm guessing is it uh is it focusing on

6012
02:09:40,189 --> 02:09:40,199
I'm guessing is it uh is it focusing on
 

6013
02:09:40,199 --> 02:09:42,549
I'm guessing is it uh is it focusing on
birds and the evolution of birds

6014
02:09:42,549 --> 02:09:42,559
birds and the evolution of birds
 

6015
02:09:42,559 --> 02:09:44,390
birds and the evolution of birds
actually there's also the evolution of

6016
02:09:44,390 --> 02:09:44,400
actually there's also the evolution of
 

6017
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:47,390
actually there's also the evolution of
beauty which is yeah which is also a

6018
02:09:47,390 --> 02:09:47,400
beauty which is yeah which is also a
 

6019
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:49,510
beauty which is yeah which is also a
great book but the no the beak of the

6020
02:09:49,510 --> 02:09:49,520
great book but the no the beak of the
 

6021
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:52,990
great book but the no the beak of the
finch is um it's

6022
02:09:52,990 --> 02:09:53,000
finch is um it's
 

6023
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:56,030
finch is um it's
a it it has two story lines that are

6024
02:09:56,030 --> 02:09:56,040
a it it has two story lines that are
 

6025
02:09:56,040 --> 02:09:58,310
a it it has two story lines that are
interwoven one is about

6026
02:09:58,310 --> 02:09:58,320
interwoven one is about
 

6027
02:09:58,320 --> 02:10:02,709
interwoven one is about
