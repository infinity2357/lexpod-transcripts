like a rock star that's kind of crazy
 

193
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:59,530
like a rock star that's kind of crazy
for old math person but it's true that

the videos in linear algebra that I made

00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,170
the videos in linear algebra that I made
 

197
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:08,720
the videos in linear algebra that I made
way back in 2000 I think I've been

198
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:08,730
way back in 2000 I think I've been
 

199
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:12,259
way back in 2000 I think I've been
watched a lot and well it's partly the

watched a lot and well it's partly the
 

201
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:14,780
watched a lot and well it's partly the
importance of linear algebra which way

202
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:14,790
importance of linear algebra which way
 

203
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,759
importance of linear algebra which way
I'm sure you'll ask me and give me a

204
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:16,769
I'm sure you'll ask me and give me a
 

205
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:19,490
I'm sure you'll ask me and give me a
chance to say that linear algebra as a

206
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:19,500
chance to say that linear algebra as a
 

207
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,890
chance to say that linear algebra as a
subject has just surged in importance

208
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:21,900
subject has just surged in importance
 

209
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,490

but also I it was a class that I taught
 

211
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,129
but also I it was a class that I taught
a bunch of times so I kind of got it

212
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:28,139
a bunch of times so I kind of got it
 

213
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:31,880
a bunch of times so I kind of got it
organized and any I'm enjoy doing it was

00:04:59,150 --> 00:04:59,160
I before going through the course at my
 

235
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,879
I before going through the course at my
university I was going through open

oh yeah you're right yeah and that I

240
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,240
oh yeah you're right yeah and that I
 

241
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,150
oh yeah you're right yeah and that I
mean we're using your book and I mean

242
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,160
mean we're using your book and I mean
 

243
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,469
mean we're using your book and I mean
that that the fact that there is

244
00:05:11,469 --> 00:05:11,479
that that the fact that there is
 

245

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:15,690
millions of people that watch that video
 

249
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,690
millions of people that watch that video
I think that's yeah that's really

250
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:17,700
I think that's yeah that's really
 

251
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,400
I think that's yeah that's really
powerful so how do you think the idea of

252
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,410
powerful so how do you think the idea of
 

253
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,860
powerful so how do you think the idea of
putting lectures online would really MIT

254
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:24,870
putting lectures online would really MIT
 

255
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,560
putting lectures online would really MIT
OpenCourseWare has innovated that was a

256
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:27,570
OpenCourseWare has innovated that was a
 

257
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,580
OpenCourseWare has innovated that was a
wonderful idea

258
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:28,590
wonderful idea
 

259
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,300
wonderful idea
you know I think the story that I've

260
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:32,310
you know I think the story that I've
 

261
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,939
you know I think the story that I've
heard is the committee committee was

262
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:34,949
heard is the committee committee was
 

263
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:36,920
heard is the committee committee was
appointed by the president president

264
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:36,930
appointed by the president president
 

265
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,690
appointed by the president president
vest at that time a wonderful guy and

266
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:40,700
vest at that time a wonderful guy and
 

267
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,129
vest at that time a wonderful guy and
the idea of the committee was to figure

268
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:43,139
the idea of the committee was to figure
 

269
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,879
the idea of the committee was to figure
out how a mighty could make be like

270
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:46,889
out how a mighty could make be like
 

271
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:50,570
out how a mighty could make be like
other universities market the market

work we were doing and then they didn't

274
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:53,729
work we were doing and then they didn't
 

275
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,969
work we were doing and then they didn't
see away and after a weekend and they

276
00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:55,979
see away and after a weekend and they
 

277
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,070
see away and after a weekend and they
had an inspiration came back to the

278
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
had an inspiration came back to the
 

279
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,560
had an inspiration came back to the
president vest and said what if we just

280
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:00,570
president vest and said what if we just
 

281
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:06,170
president vest and said what if we just
gave it away and he decided that was ok

282
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:06,180
gave it away and he decided that was ok
 

283
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,800
gave it away and he decided that was ok
good idea so that's a crazy idea that's

284
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:09,810
good idea so that's a crazy idea that's
 

285
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,080
good idea so that's a crazy idea that's
uh if we think of a university is a

286
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,090
uh if we think of a university is a
 

287
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,930
uh if we think of a university is a
thing that creates a product yes isn't

288
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:14,940
thing that creates a product yes isn't
 

289
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,170
thing that creates a product yes isn't
knowledge right the you know the kind of

290
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:18,180
knowledge right the you know the kind of
 

291
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,450
knowledge right the you know the kind of
educational knowledge isn't the products

292
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:20,460
educational knowledge isn't the products
 

293
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,240
educational knowledge isn't the products
and giving that away are you surprised

294
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,250
and giving that away are you surprised
 

295
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,870
and giving that away are you surprised
that you went through it the result that

296
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:26,880
that you went through it the result that
 

297
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,600
that you went through it the result that
he did it well knowing a little bit

298
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:29,610
he did it well knowing a little bit
 

299
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,750
he did it well knowing a little bit
president vest it was like him I think

300
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:32,760
president vest it was like him I think
 

301
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,080
president vest it was like him I think
and and it was really the right idea

302
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,090
and and it was really the right idea
 

303
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:41,360
and and it was really the right idea
you know MIT as I kind of it's known for

304
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:41,370
you know MIT as I kind of it's known for
 

305
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,959
you know MIT as I kind of it's known for
being high level technical things and

306
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:44,969
being high level technical things and
 

307
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:48,469
being high level technical things and
and this is the best way we can say tell

308
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
and this is the best way we can say tell
 

309
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,850
and this is the best way we can say tell
we can show

310
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:49,860
we can show
 

311
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,290
we can show
what MIT really is like because the the

312
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:54,300
what MIT really is like because the the
 

313
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,740
what MIT really is like because the the
in my case those 1806 videos are just

314
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:57,750
in my case those 1806 videos are just
 

315
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,480
in my case those 1806 videos are just
teaching the class they were there in

316
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:01,490
teaching the class they were there in
 

317
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,730
teaching the class they were there in
26100 they're kind of fun to look at

318
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:04,740
26100 they're kind of fun to look at
 

319
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,100
26100 they're kind of fun to look at
people write to me and say oh you've got

320
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,110
people write to me and say oh you've got
 

321
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,679
people write to me and say oh you've got
a sense of humor but I don't know where

00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:09,689
a sense of humor but I don't know where
 

323
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:12,140
a sense of humor but I don't know where
that comes through somehow I big

324
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,150
that comes through somehow I big
 

325
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,779
that comes through somehow I big
friendly with a class I like students

326
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:14,789
friendly with a class I like students
 

327
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:19,309

and and then your algebra the subject we

328
00:07:19,309 --> 00:07:19,319
and and then your algebra the subject we
 

329
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,899
and and then your algebra the subject we
got to give this subject most of the

330
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:20,909
got to give this subject most of the
 

331
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:26,869
got to give this subject most of the
credit it it really has come forward and

00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:30,599
importance in these years so let's talk
 

335
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:32,659
importance in these years so let's talk
about linear algebra a little bit

336
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:32,669
about linear algebra a little bit
 

337
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:34,129
about linear algebra a little bit
because it is such a it's both a

338
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:34,139
because it is such a it's both a
 

339
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:38,089
because it is such a it's both a
powerful and a beautiful a subfield of

340
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:38,099
powerful and a beautiful a subfield of
 

341
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:40,879
powerful and a beautiful a subfield of
mathematics so what's your favorite

342
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:40,889
mathematics so what's your favorite
 

343
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:44,659
mathematics so what's your favorite
specific topic in linear algebra or even

344
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:44,669
specific topic in linear algebra or even
 

345
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:46,839
specific topic in linear algebra or even
math in general to give a lecture on to

346
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:46,849
math in general to give a lecture on to
 

347
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:49,969
math in general to give a lecture on to
convey to tell a story to teach students

348
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:49,979
convey to tell a story to teach students
 

349
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:54,769
convey to tell a story to teach students
okay well on the teaching side so it's

350
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:54,779
okay well on the teaching side so it's
 

351
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:57,409
okay well on the teaching side so it's
not deep mathematics at all but I I'm

352
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:57,419
not deep mathematics at all but I I'm
 

353
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:01,100
not deep mathematics at all but I I'm
kind of proud of the idea of the four

354
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,110
kind of proud of the idea of the four
 

355
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,649
kind of proud of the idea of the four
subspaces there are four fundamental

356
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:03,659
subspaces there are four fundamental
 

357
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:06,120
subspaces there are four fundamental
subspaces

358
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,130
subspaces
 

359
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:09,820
subspaces
which are of course known before long

360
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:09,830
which are of course known before long
 

361
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:14,140
which are of course known before long
before my name for them but can you go

362
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:14,150
before my name for them but can you go
 

363
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,280
before my name for them but can you go
through them can you go through the

364
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,290
through them can you go through the
 

365
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:18,310
through them can you go through the
future I can yes so the first one to

366
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:18,320
future I can yes so the first one to
 

367
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,610
future I can yes so the first one to
understand is so the matrix is maybe I

368
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:21,620
understand is so the matrix is maybe I
 

369
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,800
understand is so the matrix is maybe I
should say the matrix what is the matrix

370
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:23,810
should say the matrix what is the matrix
 

371
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,110
should say the matrix what is the matrix
what's a matrix well so we have a like a

372
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:26,120
what's a matrix well so we have a like a
 

373
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,680
what's a matrix well so we have a like a
rectangle of numbers so it's got n

374
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:29,690
rectangle of numbers so it's got n
 

375
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,610
rectangle of numbers so it's got n
columns

376
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:30,620
columns
 

377
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,390
columns
got a bunch of columns and also got an M

378
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:34,400
got a bunch of columns and also got an M
 

379
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,480
got a bunch of columns and also got an M
rows let's say and the relation between

380
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:37,490
rows let's say and the relation between
 

381
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,460
rows let's say and the relation between
so of course the columns and the rows

382
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:39,470
so of course the columns and the rows
 

383
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:43,090
so of course the columns and the rows
it's the same numbers so there's got to

384
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:43,100
it's the same numbers so there's got to
 

385
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,680
it's the same numbers so there's got to
be connections there but they're not

386
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:44,690
be connections there but they're not
 

387
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,890
be connections there but they're not
simple the they're much the columns

388
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:47,900
simple the they're much the columns
 

389
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,170
simple the they're much the columns
might be longer than the rows and

390
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:50,180
might be longer than the rows and
 

391
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,360
might be longer than the rows and
they've all different the numbers are

392
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:52,370
they've all different the numbers are
 

393
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,360
they've all different the numbers are
mixed up first space to think about is

394
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:55,370
mixed up first space to think about is
 

395
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,930
mixed up first space to think about is
take the columns so those are vectors

396
00:08:58,930 --> 00:08:58,940
take the columns so those are vectors
 

397
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,050
take the columns so those are vectors
those are points in n dimensions what's

398
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:02,060
those are points in n dimensions what's
 

399
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,660
those are points in n dimensions what's
the vector so a physicist would imagine

400
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:04,670
the vector so a physicist would imagine
 

401
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,090
the vector so a physicist would imagine
a vector or might imagine a vector as a

402
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:07,100
a vector or might imagine a vector as a
 

403
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,770
a vector or might imagine a vector as a
arrow you know in space or the point it

404
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:11,780
arrow you know in space or the point it
 

405
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:16,540
arrow you know in space or the point it
ends at in space for me it's a column of

406
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:16,550
ends at in space for me it's a column of
 

407
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,080
ends at in space for me it's a column of
numbers does it you often think of this

408
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,090
numbers does it you often think of this
 

409
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,490
numbers does it you often think of this
is very interesting in terms of linear

410
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:21,500
is very interesting in terms of linear
 

411
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,730
is very interesting in terms of linear
algebra of a vector you think a little

412
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:24,740
algebra of a vector you think a little
 

413
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,330
algebra of a vector you think a little
bit more abstract than the how it's very

414
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:28,340
bit more abstract than the how it's very
 

415
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,180
bit more abstract than the how it's very
commonly used perhaps yeah you think

416
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:31,190
commonly used perhaps yeah you think
 

417
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,940
commonly used perhaps yeah you think
this arbitrary Speight multi-dimensional

418
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:33,950
this arbitrary Speight multi-dimensional
 

419
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:37,600
this arbitrary Speight multi-dimensional
right away I'm in high dimensions and in

420
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:37,610
right away I'm in high dimensions and in
 

421
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,210
right away I'm in high dimensions and in
the room lands yeah that's right in the

422
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:40,220
the room lands yeah that's right in the
 

423
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,290
the room lands yeah that's right in the
lecture I tried a so if you think of two

424
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:44,300
lecture I tried a so if you think of two
 

425
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,530
lecture I tried a so if you think of two
vectors in ten dimensions I'll do this

426
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:47,540
vectors in ten dimensions I'll do this
 

427
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,560
vectors in ten dimensions I'll do this
in class and I'll readily admit that I

428
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:50,570
in class and I'll readily admit that I
 

429
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:54,610
in class and I'll readily admit that I
have no good image in my mind of a

430
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:54,620
have no good image in my mind of a
 

431
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,670
have no good image in my mind of a
vector of arrow int n dimensional space

432
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,680
vector of arrow int n dimensional space
 

433
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,530
vector of arrow int n dimensional space
but whatever you can a you can add one

434
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:02,540
but whatever you can a you can add one
 

435
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,570
but whatever you can a you can add one
bunch of ten numbers to another bunch of

436
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:04,580
bunch of ten numbers to another bunch of
 

437
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,940
bunch of ten numbers to another bunch of
ten numbers so you can add a vector to a

438
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:06,950
ten numbers so you can add a vector to a
 

439
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,430
ten numbers so you can add a vector to a
vector and you can multiply a vector by

440
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:09,440
vector and you can multiply a vector by
 

441
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,620
vector and you can multiply a vector by
three and that's if you know how to do

442
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:11,630
three and that's if you know how to do
 

443
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,160
three and that's if you know how to do
those

444
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,170
those
 

445
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,530
those
you've got linear algebra you know ten

446
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:14,540
you've got linear algebra you know ten
 

447
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,350
you've got linear algebra you know ten
dimensions yeah you know there's this

448
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:17,360
dimensions yeah you know there's this
 

449
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,330
dimensions yeah you know there's this
beautiful thing about math if we look

450
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:19,340
beautiful thing about math if we look
 

451
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,400
beautiful thing about math if we look
string theory and all these theories

452
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:21,410
string theory and all these theories
 

453
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,230
string theory and all these theories
which are really fundamentally derived

454
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:23,240
which are really fundamentally derived
 

455
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,030
which are really fundamentally derived
through math yeah but it very difficult

456
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,040
through math yeah but it very difficult
 

457
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,830
through math yeah but it very difficult
to visualize it yeah how do you think

458
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:26,840
to visualize it yeah how do you think
 

459
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,060
to visualize it yeah how do you think
about the things like a 10 dimensional

460
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,070
about the things like a 10 dimensional
 

461
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,230
about the things like a 10 dimensional
vector that we can't really visualize

462
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:32,240
vector that we can't really visualize
 

463
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,820
vector that we can't really visualize
yeah do you and and yet math reveals

464
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:36,830
yeah do you and and yet math reveals
 

465
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:40,510
yeah do you and and yet math reveals
some beauty Oh underlying me yeah our

466
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:40,520
some beauty Oh underlying me yeah our
 

467
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,360
some beauty Oh underlying me yeah our
world in that weird thing we can't

468
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:43,370
world in that weird thing we can't
 

469
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,530
world in that weird thing we can't
visualize how do you think about that

470
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:44,540
visualize how do you think about that
 

471
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,770
visualize how do you think about that
difference well probably I'm not a very

472
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:47,780
difference well probably I'm not a very
 

473
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,510
difference well probably I'm not a very
geometric person so I'm probably

474
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:49,520
geometric person so I'm probably
 

475
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,970
geometric person so I'm probably
thinking in three dimensions and the

476
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:51,980
thinking in three dimensions and the
 

477
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,850
thinking in three dimensions and the
beauty of linear algebra is that is that

478
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:54,860
beauty of linear algebra is that is that
 

479
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,490
beauty of linear algebra is that is that
it goes on to ten dimensions with no

480
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:57,500
it goes on to ten dimensions with no
 

481
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,350
it goes on to ten dimensions with no
problem I mean that if you're just

482
00:10:59,350 --> 00:10:59,360
problem I mean that if you're just
 

483
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,440
problem I mean that if you're just
seeing what happens if you add two

484
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:02,450
seeing what happens if you add two
 

485
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,650
seeing what happens if you add two
vectors in 3d you then you can add them

486
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:05,660
vectors in 3d you then you can add them
 

487
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,000
vectors in 3d you then you can add them
in ten D or you're just adding the ten

488
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,010
in ten D or you're just adding the ten
 

489
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:14,140
in ten D or you're just adding the ten
components so so I I can't say that I

490
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:14,150
components so so I I can't say that I
 

491
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,240
components so so I I can't say that I
have a picture but yet I try to push the

492
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,250
have a picture but yet I try to push the
 

493
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,750
have a picture but yet I try to push the
class to think of a flat surface in ten

494
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:19,760
class to think of a flat surface in ten
 

495
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,750
class to think of a flat surface in ten
dimensions so a plane in ten dimensions

496
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:22,760
dimensions so a plane in ten dimensions
 

497
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,580
dimensions so a plane in ten dimensions
and so that's one of the spaces take all

498
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:27,590
and so that's one of the spaces take all
 

499
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,490
and so that's one of the spaces take all
the columns of the matrix take all their

500
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:30,500
the columns of the matrix take all their
 

501
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,100
the columns of the matrix take all their
combinations so on so much of this

502
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,110
combinations so on so much of this
 

503
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,620
combinations so on so much of this
column so much of this one then if you

504
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:35,630
column so much of this one then if you
 

505
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,780
column so much of this one then if you
put all those together you get some kind

506
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:37,790
put all those together you get some kind
 

507
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:41,410
put all those together you get some kind
of a flat surface that I call a vector

508
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:41,420
of a flat surface that I call a vector
 

509
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:45,460
of a flat surface that I call a vector
space space of vectors and and my

510
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:45,470
space space of vectors and and my
 

511
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,980
space space of vectors and and my
imagination is just seeing like a piece

512
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:47,990
imagination is just seeing like a piece
 

513
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:53,200
imagination is just seeing like a piece
of paper in 3d but anyway so that's one

514
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,210
of paper in 3d but anyway so that's one
 

515
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,750
of paper in 3d but anyway so that's one
of the spaces that's space number one

516
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:55,760
of the spaces that's space number one
 

517
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,690
of the spaces that's space number one
the column space of the matrix and then

518
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:58,700
the column space of the matrix and then
 

519
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,970
the column space of the matrix and then
there's the row space which is as I said

520
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:00,980
there's the row space which is as I said
 

521
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,670
there's the row space which is as I said
different but came came from the same

522
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:03,680
different but came came from the same
 

523
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,120
different but came came from the same
numbers so we got the column space all

524
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,130
numbers so we got the column space all
 

525
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,540
numbers so we got the column space all
combinations of the columns and then

526
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:10,550
combinations of the columns and then
 

527
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,460
combinations of the columns and then
we've got the row space all combinations

528
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:12,470
we've got the row space all combinations
 

529
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:16,240
we've got the row space all combinations
of the rows so those are those words are

530
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:16,250
of the rows so those are those words are
 

531
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,910
of the rows so those are those words are
easy for me to say and I can't really

532
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:18,920
easy for me to say and I can't really
 

533
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,040
easy for me to say and I can't really
draw them on a blackboard but I try with

534
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,050
draw them on a blackboard but I try with
 

535
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:24,250
draw them on a blackboard but I try with
my thick chalk everybody everybody likes

536
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:24,260
my thick chalk everybody everybody likes
 

537
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,010
my thick chalk everybody everybody likes
that railroad chalk and me too

538
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:27,020
that railroad chalk and me too
 

539
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,150
that railroad chalk and me too
I wouldn't use anything else now

540
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,160
I wouldn't use anything else now
 

541
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,260
I wouldn't use anything else now
and and then the other two spaces are

542
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:33,270
and and then the other two spaces are
 

543
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,820
and and then the other two spaces are
perpendicular to those so like if you

544
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:35,830
perpendicular to those so like if you
 

545
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:40,230
perpendicular to those so like if you
have a plane in 3d just a plane is just

546
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:40,240
have a plane in 3d just a plane is just
 

547
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,700
have a plane in 3d just a plane is just
a flat surface in 3d then perpendicular

548
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:44,710
a flat surface in 3d then perpendicular
 

549
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,460
a flat surface in 3d then perpendicular
to that plane would be a line so that

550
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:47,470
to that plane would be a line so that
 

551
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:51,300
to that plane would be a line so that
would be the null space so we've got two

552
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:51,310
would be the null space so we've got two
 

553
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,640
would be the null space so we've got two
we've got a column space a row space and

554
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:53,650
we've got a column space a row space and
 

555
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:57,060
we've got a column space a row space and
they're two perpendicular spaces so

556
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,070
they're two perpendicular spaces so
 

557
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:00,050
they're two perpendicular spaces so
those four fit together in the in a

558
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:00,060
those four fit together in the in a
 

559
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,060
those four fit together in the in a
beautiful picture of a matrix yeah yeah

560
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:03,070
beautiful picture of a matrix yeah yeah
 

561
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,640
beautiful picture of a matrix yeah yeah
it's sort of a fundamental it's not a

562
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:05,650
it's sort of a fundamental it's not a
 

563
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,250
it's sort of a fundamental it's not a
difficult idea comes comes pretty early

564
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:08,260
difficult idea comes comes pretty early
 

565
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:14,520
difficult idea comes comes pretty early
in 1806 and it's basic planes in these

566
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:14,530
in 1806 and it's basic planes in these
 

567
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:17,100
in 1806 and it's basic planes in these
multi-dimensional spaces how how

568
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,110
multi-dimensional spaces how how
 

569
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,650
multi-dimensional spaces how how
difficult of an idea is that to come to

570
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:19,660
difficult of an idea is that to come to
 

571
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,690
difficult of an idea is that to come to
do you think if you if you look back in

572
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:21,700
do you think if you if you look back in
 

573
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,710
do you think if you if you look back in
time yeah I think mathematically it

574
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:25,720
time yeah I think mathematically it
 

575
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,390
time yeah I think mathematically it
makes sense but I don't know if it's

576
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:27,400
makes sense but I don't know if it's
 

577
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,090
makes sense but I don't know if it's
intuitive for us to imagine just what

578
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:30,100
intuitive for us to imagine just what
 

579
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,750
intuitive for us to imagine just what
we're talking about

580
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:30,760
we're talking about
 

581
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,750
we're talking about
feels like calculus is easier to I see

582
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:33,760
feels like calculus is easier to I see
 

583
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,030
feels like calculus is easier to I see
into it well calculus I have to admit

584
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,040
into it well calculus I have to admit
 

585
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,970
into it well calculus I have to admit
calculus came earlier earlier than

586
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:38,980
calculus came earlier earlier than
 

587
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,890
calculus came earlier earlier than
linear algebra so Newton and Leibniz

588
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:40,900
linear algebra so Newton and Leibniz
 

589
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,160
linear algebra so Newton and Leibniz
were the great men to understand the key

590
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,170
were the great men to understand the key
 

591
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:48,330
were the great men to understand the key
ideas of calculus but linear algebra to

592
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:48,340
ideas of calculus but linear algebra to
 

593
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,510
ideas of calculus but linear algebra to
me is like okay it's the starting point

594
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:51,520
me is like okay it's the starting point
 

595
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,660
me is like okay it's the starting point
because it's all about flat things

596
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:53,670
because it's all about flat things
 

597
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,340
because it's all about flat things
calculus has got all the complications

598
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:56,350
calculus has got all the complications
 

599
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,950
calculus has got all the complications
of calculus come from the curves the

600
00:13:58,950 --> 00:13:58,960
of calculus come from the curves the
 

601
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,420
of calculus come from the curves the
bending this is a curved surfaces linear

602
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:03,430
bending this is a curved surfaces linear
 

603
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,490
bending this is a curved surfaces linear
algebra the surfaces are all flat

604
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:05,500
algebra the surfaces are all flat
 

605
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,330
algebra the surfaces are all flat
nothing bends in linear algebra so it

606
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:09,340
nothing bends in linear algebra so it
 

607
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,170
nothing bends in linear algebra so it
should have come first but it didn't and

608
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:12,180
should have come first but it didn't and
 

609
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,170
should have come first but it didn't and
calculus also comes first in in high

610
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:16,180
calculus also comes first in in high
 

611
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:19,740
calculus also comes first in in high
school classes in in college class it'll

612
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:19,750
school classes in in college class it'll
 

613
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,870
school classes in in college class it'll
be freshman math I'll be calculus and

614
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:21,880
be freshman math I'll be calculus and
 

615
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,890
be freshman math I'll be calculus and
then I say enough of it like okay get to

616
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:25,900
then I say enough of it like okay get to
 

617
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,160
then I say enough of it like okay get to
get to the good stuff and that you think

618
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:29,170
get to the good stuff and that you think
 

619
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,630
get to the good stuff and that you think
linear algebra should come first

620
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:30,640
linear algebra should come first
 

621
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,720
linear algebra should come first
well it really yeah I'm okay with it not

622
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:33,730
well it really yeah I'm okay with it not
 

623
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:36,120
well it really yeah I'm okay with it not
coming first but it should yeah

624
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,130
coming first but it should yeah
 

625
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,180
coming first but it should yeah
it should it's simpler because

626
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:39,190
it should it's simpler because
 

627
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,740
it should it's simpler because
everything is flat yeah everything's

628
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:40,750
everything is flat yeah everything's
 

629
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,650
everything is flat yeah everything's
flat of course for that reason you

630
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:43,660
flat of course for that reason you
 

631
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,130
flat of course for that reason you
sort of sticks to one dimension or so or

632
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:47,140
sort of sticks to one dimension or so or
 

633
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,770
sort of sticks to one dimension or so or

and and if the patient reacted favorably
 

685
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,800
and and if the patient reacted favorably
to the drug then you put up some

those numbers you got a big big set of
 

695
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,670
those numbers you got a big big set of
numbers and what are the patterns what's

important pieces of the matrix which add

732
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:23,520
important pieces of the matrix which add
 

733
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,640
important pieces of the matrix which add
up to the whole matrix so so you're

734
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:25,650
up to the whole matrix so so you're
 

735
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:29,530
up to the whole matrix so so you're
breaking a matrix into simple pieces and

736
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:29,540
breaking a matrix into simple pieces and
 

737
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,270
breaking a matrix into simple pieces and
the first piece is the most important

738
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:32,280
the first piece is the most important
 

739
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,310
the first piece is the most important
part of the data the second piece is the

740
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:34,320
part of the data the second piece is the
 

741
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,060
part of the data the second piece is the
second most important part and then

742
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:38,070
second most important part and then
 

743
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,570
second most important part and then
often so a data scientist will like if

744
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:41,580
often so a data scientist will like if
 

745
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,290
often so a data scientist will like if
if a data scientist can find those first

746
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:45,300
if a data scientist can find those first
 

747
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,380
if a data scientist can find those first
and second pieces stop there the rest of

748
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:48,390
and second pieces stop there the rest of
 

749
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:52,850
and second pieces stop there the rest of
of the data is probably round off you

750
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:52,860
of the data is probably round off you
 

751
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,990
of the data is probably round off you
know we're yeah experimental error maybe

752
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:57,000
know we're yeah experimental error maybe
 

753
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,480
know we're yeah experimental error maybe
so you're looking for the important part

754
00:17:59,480 --> 00:17:59,490
so you're looking for the important part
 

755
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,030
so you're looking for the important part
yeah so what do you find beautiful about

756
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:02,040
yeah so what do you find beautiful about
 

757
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,370
yeah so what do you find beautiful about
singular values well yeah I didn't give

758
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:04,380
singular values well yeah I didn't give
 

759
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,430
singular values well yeah I didn't give
the theorem so here's the here's the

760
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:07,440
the theorem so here's the here's the
 

761
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,190
the theorem so here's the here's the
idea of singular values every matrix

very simple special matrices so that's

768
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:20,310
very simple special matrices so that's
 

769
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,490

not so easy to visualize but everybody

794
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:00,210
not so easy to visualize but everybody
 

795
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:04,030
not so easy to visualize but everybody
can visualize a rotation take-take-take

796
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:04,040
can visualize a rotation take-take-take
 

797
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,110
can visualize a rotation take-take-take
two-dimensional space and just turn it

798
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:06,120
two-dimensional space and just turn it
 

799
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,140
two-dimensional space and just turn it
around the around the center

800
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,150
around the around the center
 

801
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,420
around the around the center
take three-dimensional space so a pilot

802
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:11,430
take three-dimensional space so a pilot
 

803
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,970
take three-dimensional space so a pilot
has to know about well what are the

804
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:13,980
has to know about well what are the
 

805
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,940
has to know about well what are the
three the yaw is one of them I've

806
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:16,950
three the yaw is one of them I've
 

807
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,520
three the yaw is one of them I've
forgotten all the three turns that a

808
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:19,530
forgotten all the three turns that a
 

809
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:23,510
forgotten all the three turns that a
pilot makes up to ten dimensions you've

810
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:23,520
pilot makes up to ten dimensions you've
 

811
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,630
pilot makes up to ten dimensions you've
got ten ways to turn but you can

812
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:26,640
got ten ways to turn but you can
 

813
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,390
got ten ways to turn but you can
visualize a rotation take the space and

814
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:29,400
visualize a rotation take the space and
 

815
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,880
visualize a rotation take the space and
turn it and you can visualize a stretch

816
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:31,890
turn it and you can visualize a stretch
 

817
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:36,370
turn it and you can visualize a stretch
so to break a a matrix with all those

818
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:36,380
so to break a a matrix with all those
 

819
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,310
so to break a a matrix with all those
numbers in it into something you can

820
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,320
numbers in it into something you can
 

821
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,730
numbers in it into something you can
visualize rotate stretch rotate it's

822
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:43,740
visualize rotate stretch rotate it's
 

823
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,070
visualize rotate stretch rotate it's
pretty neat pretty neat that's pretty

824
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:46,080
pretty neat pretty neat that's pretty
 

825
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,960
pretty neat pretty neat that's pretty
powerful on YouTube just consuming a

826
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:50,970
powerful on YouTube just consuming a
 

827
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,000
powerful on YouTube just consuming a
bunch of videos and just watching what

828
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,010
bunch of videos and just watching what
 

829
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,340
bunch of videos and just watching what
people connect with and what they really

830
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:55,350
people connect with and what they really
 

831
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:58,190
people connect with and what they really
enjoy and are inspired by math seems to

832
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:58,200
enjoy and are inspired by math seems to
 

833
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,480
enjoy and are inspired by math seems to
come up again and again I I'm trying to

834
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:02,490
come up again and again I I'm trying to
 

835
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,610
come up again and again I I'm trying to
understand why that is perhaps you can

836
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:04,620
understand why that is perhaps you can
 

837
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,650
understand why that is perhaps you can
help yeah I mean give me clues so it's

838
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:06,660
help yeah I mean give me clues so it's
 

839
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,290
help yeah I mean give me clues so it's
not just to let the kinds of lectures

840
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:09,300
not just to let the kinds of lectures
 

841
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,590
not just to let the kinds of lectures
that you give but it's also just other

842
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:12,600
that you give but it's also just other
 

843
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,330
that you give but it's also just other
folks were like with numberphile there's

844
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:14,340
folks were like with numberphile there's
 

845
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,250
folks were like with numberphile there's
a channel where they just chat about

846
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:16,260
a channel where they just chat about
 

847
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,350
a channel where they just chat about
things that are extremely complicated

848
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:18,360
things that are extremely complicated
 

849
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,370
things that are extremely complicated
actually

850
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:19,380
actually
 

851
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,410
actually
yeah people nevertheless connect with

852
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:21,420
yeah people nevertheless connect with
 

853
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,810
yeah people nevertheless connect with
them you know what do you think that is

854
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:23,820
them you know what do you think that is
 

855
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,330
them you know what do you think that is
what it's wonderful isn't it I mean I

856
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:26,340
what it's wonderful isn't it I mean I
 

857
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,700
what it's wonderful isn't it I mean I
wasn't really aware of it do so we're

858
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:28,710
wasn't really aware of it do so we're
 

859
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,340
wasn't really aware of it do so we're
we're conditioned to think math is hard

860
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:31,350
we're conditioned to think math is hard
 

861
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:34,850
we're conditioned to think math is hard
math is abstract math is just for a few

862
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:34,860
math is abstract math is just for a few
 

863
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,070
math is abstract math is just for a few
people but it isn't that way a lot of

864
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,080
people but it isn't that way a lot of
 

865
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,390
people but it isn't that way a lot of
people quite like math and they liked it

866
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:41,400
people quite like math and they liked it
 

867
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,880
people quite like math and they liked it
I get messages from people saying you

868
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:43,890
I get messages from people saying you
 

869
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,530
I get messages from people saying you
know now I'm retired I'm gonna learn

870
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:45,540
know now I'm retired I'm gonna learn
 

871
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,110
know now I'm retired I'm gonna learn
some more math I get a lot of those it's

872
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:48,120
some more math I get a lot of those it's
 

873
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,660
some more math I get a lot of those it's
really encouraging and I think what

874
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:50,670
really encouraging and I think what
 

875
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,790
really encouraging and I think what
people like is that there's some order

876
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:52,800
people like is that there's some order
 

877
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,250
people like is that there's some order
you know a lot of order and or you know

878
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:55,260
you know a lot of order and or you know
 

879
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:59,680
you know a lot of order and or you know
things are not obvious but they're true

880
00:20:59,680 --> 00:20:59,690
things are not obvious but they're true
 

881
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:03,140
things are not obvious but they're true
so it's really cheering to think that

882
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:03,150
so it's really cheering to think that
 

883
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:07,010
so it's really cheering to think that
that so many people really want to learn

884
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:07,020
that so many people really want to learn
 

885
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,270
that so many people really want to learn
more about math yeah in terms of truth

886
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:10,280
more about math yeah in terms of truth
 

887
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:15,110
more about math yeah in terms of truth
again sorry to slide into philosophy at

888
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,120
again sorry to slide into philosophy at
 

889
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,070
again sorry to slide into philosophy at
times yeah math does reveal pretty

890
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:19,080
times yeah math does reveal pretty
 

891
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,470
times yeah math does reveal pretty
strongly what things are true

892
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:21,480
strongly what things are true
 

893
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,850
strongly what things are true
yeah I mean it's the whole point of

894
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:22,860
yeah I mean it's the whole point of
 

895
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,600
yeah I mean it's the whole point of
proving things is and yet sort of our

896
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:26,610
proving things is and yet sort of our
 

897
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:31,009
proving things is and yet sort of our
real world is messy and complicated what

898
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:31,019
real world is messy and complicated what
 

899
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:33,080
real world is messy and complicated what
do you think about the nature of truth

900
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,090
do you think about the nature of truth
 

901
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:36,080
do you think about the nature of truth
that math reveals oh wow because it is a

902
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,090
that math reveals oh wow because it is a
 

903
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,669
that math reveals oh wow because it is a
source of comfort like you've mentioned

904
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:37,679
source of comfort like you've mentioned
 

905
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,139
source of comfort like you've mentioned
yeah that's right

906
00:21:39,139 --> 00:21:39,149
yeah that's right
 

907
00:21:39,149 --> 00:21:41,720
yeah that's right
well I have to say I'm not much of a

908
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:41,730
well I have to say I'm not much of a
 

909
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,659
well I have to say I'm not much of a
philosopher I just like numbers you know

910
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:44,669
philosopher I just like numbers you know
 

911
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:47,899
philosopher I just like numbers you know
I think yeah I would you this was before

912
00:21:47,899 --> 00:21:47,909
I think yeah I would you this was before
 

913
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:52,639
I think yeah I would you this was before
you had you had to go in when you're in

914
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:52,649
you had you had to go in when you're in
 

915
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:54,560
you had you had to go in when you're in
the other filling your teeth yeah I kind

916
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:54,570
the other filling your teeth yeah I kind
 

917
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,649
the other filling your teeth yeah I kind
of just take it yeah so I what I did was

918
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:57,659
of just take it yeah so I what I did was
 

919
00:21:57,659 --> 00:21:59,659
of just take it yeah so I what I did was
think about math you know like take

920
00:21:59,659 --> 00:21:59,669
think about math you know like take
 

921
00:21:59,669 --> 00:22:04,100
think about math you know like take
powers of 2 2 4 8 16 up until the time

922
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:04,110
powers of 2 2 4 8 16 up until the time
 

923
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,470
powers of 2 2 4 8 16 up until the time
the two stopped hurting and the dentist

924
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:06,480
the two stopped hurting and the dentist
 

925
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,940
the two stopped hurting and the dentist
said you're through or Counting yeah so

926
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:10,950
said you're through or Counting yeah so
 

927
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,310
said you're through or Counting yeah so
so that was the source of just such a

928
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:13,320
so that was the source of just such a
 

929
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,480
so that was the source of just such a
piece almost yeah what what what what is

930
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:17,490
piece almost yeah what what what what is
 

931
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,250
piece almost yeah what what what what is
it about math you think that brings that

932
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:19,260
it about math you think that brings that
 

933
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,799
it about math you think that brings that
yeah what is that well you know where

934
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:21,809
yeah what is that well you know where
 

935
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:24,350
yeah what is that well you know where
you are yeah symmetry it's it's

936
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:24,360
you are yeah symmetry it's it's
 

937
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,139
you are yeah symmetry it's it's
certainty the fact that you know if

938
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:27,149
certainty the fact that you know if
 

939
00:22:27,149 --> 00:22:30,019
certainty the fact that you know if
you'd to if you multiply 2 by itself 10

940
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:30,029
you'd to if you multiply 2 by itself 10
 

941
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:32,629
you'd to if you multiply 2 by itself 10
times you get a thousand 24 period

942
00:22:32,629 --> 00:22:32,639
times you get a thousand 24 period
 

943
00:22:32,639 --> 00:22:35,149
times you get a thousand 24 period
that's everybody's gonna get that do you

944
00:22:35,149 --> 00:22:35,159
that's everybody's gonna get that do you
 

945
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:38,419
that's everybody's gonna get that do you
see math is a powerful tool or is an art

946
00:22:38,419 --> 00:22:38,429
see math is a powerful tool or is an art
 

947
00:22:38,429 --> 00:22:41,389
see math is a powerful tool or is an art
form so it's both that's that's really

948
00:22:41,389 --> 00:22:41,399
form so it's both that's that's really
 

949
00:22:41,399 --> 00:22:43,580
form so it's both that's that's really
one of the neat things you can you can

950
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:43,590
one of the neat things you can you can
 

951
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:46,730
one of the neat things you can you can
be an artist and and like math you can

952
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:46,740
be an artist and and like math you can
 

953
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,680
be an artist and and like math you can
be a engineer and use math which are you

954
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:51,690
be a engineer and use math which are you
 

955
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:54,409
be a engineer and use math which are you
which am I what did you connect with

956
00:22:54,409 --> 00:22:54,419
which am I what did you connect with
 

957
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:57,470
which am I what did you connect with
most yeah I'm in here between I'm

958
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:57,480
most yeah I'm in here between I'm
 

959
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,769
most yeah I'm in here between I'm
certainly not a artist type philosopher

960
00:23:00,769 --> 00:23:00,779
certainly not a artist type philosopher
 

961
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,930
certainly not a artist type philosopher
type person might sound that way this

962
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:02,940
type person might sound that way this
 

963
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:07,730
type person might sound that way this
morning but I'm not yeah I I really

964
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:07,740
morning but I'm not yeah I I really
 

965
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,340
morning but I'm not yeah I I really
enjoy teaching engineers because they

966
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:10,350
enjoy teaching engineers because they
 

967
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:16,159
enjoy teaching engineers because they
they they go for an answer and yeah so

968
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:16,169
they they go for an answer and yeah so
 

969
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:18,710
they they go for an answer and yeah so
of probably within the mountain MIT math

970
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:18,720
of probably within the mountain MIT math
 

971
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,730
of probably within the mountain MIT math
department most people enjoy teaching

972
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:22,740
department most people enjoy teaching
 

973
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,340
department most people enjoy teaching
people teaching students who get the

974
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:25,350
people teaching students who get the
 

975
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:29,779
people teaching students who get the
abstract idea I'm okay with with I'm

976
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:29,789
abstract idea I'm okay with with I'm
 

977
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:32,990
abstract idea I'm okay with with I'm
good with engineers who are looking for

978
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:33,000
good with engineers who are looking for
 

979
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,700
good with engineers who are looking for
a way to find answers

980
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:34,710
a way to find answers
 

981
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,620
a way to find answers
yeah actually that's a interesting

982
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:36,630
yeah actually that's a interesting
 

983
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:39,440
yeah actually that's a interesting
question do you think do you think for

984
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:39,450
question do you think do you think for
 

985
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,659
question do you think do you think for
teaching and in general but thinking

986
00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:41,669
teaching and in general but thinking
 

987
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:43,159
teaching and in general but thinking
about new concepts do you think it's

988
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:43,169
about new concepts do you think it's
 

989
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:47,659
about new concepts do you think it's
better to plug in the numbers or to

990
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:47,669
better to plug in the numbers or to
 

991
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:51,380
better to plug in the numbers or to
think more abstractly so looking at

992
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:51,390
think more abstractly so looking at
 

993
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:53,659
think more abstractly so looking at
theorems and proving the theorems or

994
00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:53,669
theorems and proving the theorems or
 

995
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:56,149
theorems and proving the theorems or
actually you know building up a

996
00:23:56,149 --> 00:23:56,159
actually you know building up a
 

997
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,250
actually you know building up a
basically tuition of the theorem or the

998
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:58,260
basically tuition of the theorem or the
 

999
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,380
basically tuition of the theorem or the
method the approach and then just

1000
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:00,390
method the approach and then just
 

1001
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:02,659
method the approach and then just
plugging in numbers and seeing it work

1002
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:02,669
plugging in numbers and seeing it work
 

1003
00:24:02,669 --> 00:24:07,190
plugging in numbers and seeing it work
you know well certainly many of us like

1004
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,200
you know well certainly many of us like
 

1005
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,090
you know well certainly many of us like
to see examples first we understand it

1006
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:11,100
to see examples first we understand it
 

1007
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,220
to see examples first we understand it
might be a pretty abstract sounding

1008
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:13,230
might be a pretty abstract sounding
 

1009
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:15,620
might be a pretty abstract sounding
example like a three dimensional

1010
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:15,630
example like a three dimensional
 

1011
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,350
example like a three dimensional
rotation how are you gonna how are you

1012
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:18,360
rotation how are you gonna how are you
 

1013
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:23,090
rotation how are you gonna how are you
gonna understand a rotation in 3d or in

1014
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:23,100
gonna understand a rotation in 3d or in
 

1015
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:29,240
gonna understand a rotation in 3d or in
10 D or but and then some of us like to

1016
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:29,250
10 D or but and then some of us like to
 

1017
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,460
10 D or but and then some of us like to
keep going with it to the point where

1018
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:31,470
keep going with it to the point where
 

1019
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,850
keep going with it to the point where
you got numbers where you got 10 angles

1020
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:34,860
you got numbers where you got 10 angles
 

1021
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:41,779
you got numbers where you got 10 angles
10 axes 10 angles but the best the great

1022
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:41,789
10 axes 10 angles but the best the great
 

1023
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:43,909
10 axes 10 angles but the best the great
mathematicians is probably I don't know

1024
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:43,919
mathematicians is probably I don't know
 

1025
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,669
mathematicians is probably I don't know
if they do that because they they for

1026
00:24:46,669 --> 00:24:46,679
if they do that because they they for
 

1027
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:52,130
if they do that because they they for
them for them an example would be a

1028
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:52,140
them for them an example would be a
 

1029
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,620
them for them an example would be a
highly abstract thing to the rest of it

1030
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:54,630
highly abstract thing to the rest of it
 

1031
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,299
highly abstract thing to the rest of it
right but nevertheless working within

1032
00:24:56,299 --> 00:24:56,309
right but nevertheless working within
 

1033
00:24:56,309 --> 00:24:58,370
right but nevertheless working within
the space of examples yeah example it

1034
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:58,380
the space of examples yeah example it
 

1035
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,210
the space of examples yeah example it
seems to examples of structure our brain

1036
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:02,220
seems to examples of structure our brain
 

1037
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,760
seems to examples of structure our brain
seemed to connect with that yeah yeah so

1038
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:04,770
seemed to connect with that yeah yeah so
 

1039
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,830
seemed to connect with that yeah yeah so
uh I'm not sure if you're familiar with

1040
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:06,840
uh I'm not sure if you're familiar with
 

1041
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,560
uh I'm not sure if you're familiar with
him but Andrew yang is the presidential

1042
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:09,570
him but Andrew yang is the presidential
 

1043
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:14,510
him but Andrew yang is the presidential
candidate currently running yeah with

1044
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:14,520
candidate currently running yeah with
 

1045
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,240
candidate currently running yeah with
the math in all capital letters and his

1046
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:17,250
the math in all capital letters and his
 

1047
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:20,120
the math in all capital letters and his
hats as a slogan Isis stands for make

1048
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,130
hats as a slogan Isis stands for make
 

1049
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:24,310

America think hard okay I'll vote for it

1050
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:24,320
America think hard okay I'll vote for it
 

1051
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,500
America think hard okay I'll vote for it
so and his name rhymes with yours yang

1052
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:27,510
so and his name rhymes with yours yang
 

1053
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:30,019
so and his name rhymes with yours yang
strang so but he also loves math and

1054
00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:30,029
strang so but he also loves math and
 

1055
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,960
strang so but he also loves math and
then he comes from that world but he

1056
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:32,970
then he comes from that world but he
 

1057
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:36,500
then he comes from that world but he
also looking at it makes me realize that

1058
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:36,510
also looking at it makes me realize that
 

1059
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,899
also looking at it makes me realize that
math science and engineering are not

1060
00:25:38,899 --> 00:25:38,909
math science and engineering are not
 

1061
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:42,260
math science and engineering are not
really part of our politics right

1062
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:42,270
really part of our politics right
 

1063
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,090
really part of our politics right
political discourse about political a

1064
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:44,100
political discourse about political a
 

1065
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,730
political discourse about political a
government in general yeah what do you

1066
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:46,740
government in general yeah what do you
 

1067
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,760
government in general yeah what do you
think

1068
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:47,770
think
 

1069
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:50,340
think
that is well what are your thoughts on

1070
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:50,350
that is well what are your thoughts on
 

1071
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,020
that is well what are your thoughts on
that in general well certainly somewhere

1072
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:52,030
that in general well certainly somewhere
 

1073
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:54,840
that in general well certainly somewhere
in this system we need people who are

1074
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:54,850
in this system we need people who are
 

1075
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:57,360
in this system we need people who are
comfortable with numbers comfortable

1076
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:57,370
comfortable with numbers comfortable
 

1077
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,730
comfortable with numbers comfortable
with quantities you know if you if you

1078
00:25:59,730 --> 00:25:59,740
with quantities you know if you if you
 

1079
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:04,580
with quantities you know if you if you
say this leads to that they see it it's

1080
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:04,590
say this leads to that they see it it's
 

1081
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:07,290
say this leads to that they see it it's
undeniable but isn't it strange to you

1082
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:07,300
undeniable but isn't it strange to you
 

1083
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,620
undeniable but isn't it strange to you
that we have almost no I mean I'm pretty

1084
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:10,630
that we have almost no I mean I'm pretty
 

1085
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:14,340
that we have almost no I mean I'm pretty
sure we have no elected officials in

1086
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:14,350
sure we have no elected officials in
 

1087
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:17,940
sure we have no elected officials in
Congress or obviously the president yeah

1088
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:17,950
Congress or obviously the president yeah
 

1089
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:21,480
Congress or obviously the president yeah
that is either it has an engineering

1090
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:21,490
that is either it has an engineering
 

1091
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:24,510
that is either it has an engineering
degree or a mess yeah well that's too

1092
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:24,520
degree or a mess yeah well that's too
 

1093
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:29,430
degree or a mess yeah well that's too
bad you know a few could a few who could

1094
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:29,440
bad you know a few could a few who could
 

1095
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,620
bad you know a few could a few who could
make the connection yeah it would have

1096
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:31,630
make the connection yeah it would have
 

1097
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:34,830
make the connection yeah it would have
to be people who are at the door who

1098
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:34,840
to be people who are at the door who
 

1099
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,049
to be people who are at the door who
understand engineering or science and at

1100
00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:37,059
understand engineering or science and at
 

1101
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:42,049
understand engineering or science and at
the same time can make speeches and and

1102
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:42,059
the same time can make speeches and and
 

1103
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:46,740
the same time can make speeches and and
lead yeah inspire people yeah yeah you

1104
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:46,750
lead yeah inspire people yeah yeah you
 

1105
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,169
lead yeah inspire people yeah yeah you
were speaking of inspiration the

1106
00:26:49,169 --> 00:26:49,179
were speaking of inspiration the
 

1107
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:51,030
were speaking of inspiration the
president of the Society for industrial

1108
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:51,040
president of the Society for industrial
 

1109
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,390
president of the Society for industrial
applied mathematics oh yeah as a major

1110
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:54,400
applied mathematics oh yeah as a major
 

1111
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,320
applied mathematics oh yeah as a major
organization in math and Padma what do

1112
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:58,330
organization in math and Padma what do
 

1113
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:01,320
organization in math and Padma what do
you see as a role of that society you

1114
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:01,330
you see as a role of that society you
 

1115
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,900
you see as a role of that society you
know in our public discourse right yeah

1116
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:03,910
know in our public discourse right yeah
 

1117
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:06,450
know in our public discourse right yeah
so well it was fun to be president at

1118
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:06,460
so well it was fun to be president at
 

1119
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,840
so well it was fun to be president at
the at the time of years year two years

1120
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,850
the at the time of years year two years
 

1121
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:15,180
the at the time of years year two years
around around 2000 his hope as president

1122
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:15,190
around around 2000 his hope as president
 

1123
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,919
around around 2000 his hope as president
of a pretty small society but

1124
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:16,929
of a pretty small society but
 

1125
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:19,830
of a pretty small society but
nevertheless it was a time when math was

1126
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:19,840
nevertheless it was a time when math was
 

1127
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,070
nevertheless it was a time when math was
getting some more attention in

1128
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:23,080
getting some more attention in
 

1129
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,490
getting some more attention in
Washington but yeah I got to give a

1130
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:26,500
Washington but yeah I got to give a
 

1131
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:32,010
Washington but yeah I got to give a
little 10 minutes to into committee of

1132
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:32,020
little 10 minutes to into committee of
 

1133
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,450
little 10 minutes to into committee of
the House of Representatives

1134
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:33,460
the House of Representatives
 

1135
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:36,419
the House of Representatives
talking about why mint and then actually

1136
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:36,429
talking about why mint and then actually
 

1137
00:27:36,429 --> 00:27:39,810
talking about why mint and then actually
it was fun because one of the members of

1138
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:39,820
it was fun because one of the members of
 

1139
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:43,590
it was fun because one of the members of
the house he had been a student had been

1140
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:43,600
the house he had been a student had been
 

1141
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,540
the house he had been a student had been
in my class what do you think of that

1142
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:45,550
in my class what do you think of that
 

1143
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,840
in my class what do you think of that
yeah as you say a pretty rare most most

1144
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:48,850
yeah as you say a pretty rare most most
 

1145
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,460
yeah as you say a pretty rare most most
members of the House have had a

1146
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:50,470
members of the House have had a
 

1147
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,710
members of the House have had a
different training different background

1148
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:52,720
different training different background
 

1149
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,430
different training different background
but there was one from New Hampshire who

1150
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:56,440
but there was one from New Hampshire who
 

1151
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,990
but there was one from New Hampshire who
who was my friend really bye-bye being

1152
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:01,000
who was my friend really bye-bye being
 

1153
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,780
who was my friend really bye-bye being
in the class

1154
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:01,790
in the class
 

1155
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:05,920
in the class
yeah so that those years were good then

1156
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:05,930
yeah so that those years were good then
 

1157
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:10,450
yeah so that those years were good then
of course other things take take over

1158
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:10,460
of course other things take take over
 

1159
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:13,030
of course other things take take over
and importance in Washington and maths

1160
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:13,040
and importance in Washington and maths
 

1161
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,560
and importance in Washington and maths
math just at this point is not so

1162
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:17,570
math just at this point is not so
 

1163
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,840
math just at this point is not so
visible but for a little moment it was

1164
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:19,850
visible but for a little moment it was
 

1165
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:23,170
visible but for a little moment it was
there's some excitement some concern

1166
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:23,180
there's some excitement some concern
 

1167
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,270
there's some excitement some concern
about artificial intelligence in

1168
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:25,280
about artificial intelligence in
 

1169
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,610
about artificial intelligence in
Washington now yes about the future yeah

1170
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:27,620
Washington now yes about the future yeah
 

1171
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,500
Washington now yes about the future yeah
and I think at the core of that is math

1172
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:29,510
and I think at the core of that is math
 

1173
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:32,380
and I think at the core of that is math
well it is yeah yeah but maybe it's

1174
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:32,390
well it is yeah yeah but maybe it's
 

1175
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,700
well it is yeah yeah but maybe it's
hidden maybe he's wearing a different

1176
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:33,710
hidden maybe he's wearing a different
 

1177
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:37,360
hidden maybe he's wearing a different
hat but uh well artificial intelligence

1178
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:37,370
hat but uh well artificial intelligence
 

1179
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:40,060
hat but uh well artificial intelligence
and and particularly can I use the words

1180
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:40,070
and and particularly can I use the words
 

1181
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:42,670
and and particularly can I use the words
deep learning it's a deep learning is a

1182
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:42,680
deep learning it's a deep learning is a
 

1183
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,990
deep learning it's a deep learning is a
particular approach to understanding

1184
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:47,000
particular approach to understanding
 

1185
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,360
particular approach to understanding
data again you've got a big a whole lot

1186
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:49,370
data again you've got a big a whole lot
 

1187
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:53,970
data again you've got a big a whole lot
of data where data is just swapping the

1188
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:53,980
of data where data is just swapping the
 

1189
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:58,180
of data where data is just swapping the
computers of the world and and - and

1190
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:58,190
computers of the world and and - and
 

1191
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:00,550
computers of the world and and - and
understand it out of all those numbers

1192
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:00,560
understand it out of all those numbers
 

1193
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,060
understand it out of all those numbers
to find what's important you know in

1194
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:03,070
to find what's important you know in
 

1195
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:06,520
to find what's important you know in
climate in everything and artificial

1196
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:06,530
climate in everything and artificial
 

1197
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:10,060

intelligence is two words for for one

1198
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:10,070
intelligence is two words for for one
 

1199
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,550
intelligence is two words for for one
approach to data deep learning is a

1200
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:12,560
approach to data deep learning is a
 

1201
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,330
approach to data deep learning is a
specific approach there which uses a lot

1202
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:16,340
specific approach there which uses a lot
 

1203
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,360
specific approach there which uses a lot
of linear algebra so I got into it I

1204
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:19,370
of linear algebra so I got into it I
 

1205
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,620
of linear algebra so I got into it I
thought okay I've got to learn about

1206
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:20,630
thought okay I've got to learn about
 

1207
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:24,190
thought okay I've got to learn about
this so maybe from your perspective and

1208
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:24,200
this so maybe from your perspective and
 

1209
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,280
this so maybe from your perspective and
I asked the this most basic question

1210
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:27,290
I asked the this most basic question
 

1211
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,770
I asked the this most basic question
yeah how do you think of a neural

1212
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:29,780
yeah how do you think of a neural
 

1213
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,540
yeah how do you think of a neural
network what is it and you're on the 1

1214
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:31,550
network what is it and you're on the 1
 

1215
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:36,370
network what is it and you're on the 1
yeah ok so can I start with a idea about

1216
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:36,380
yeah ok so can I start with a idea about
 

1217
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,260
yeah ok so can I start with a idea about
deep learning what does that mean sure

1218
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:38,270
deep learning what does that mean sure
 

1219
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:40,510
deep learning what does that mean sure
what is deep learning what is deep

1220
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:40,520
what is deep learning what is deep
 

1221
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,930
what is deep learning what is deep
learning yeah so so we're trying to

1222
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:43,940
learning yeah so so we're trying to
 

1223
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,360
learning yeah so so we're trying to
learn from all this day that we're

1224
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:46,370
learn from all this day that we're
 

1225
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,040
learn from all this day that we're
trying to learn what's important what

1226
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,050
trying to learn what's important what
 

1227
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:50,770
trying to learn what's important what
was some What's it telling us so you've

1228
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:50,780
was some What's it telling us so you've
 

1229
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:54,610
was some What's it telling us so you've
you've got data you've got some inputs

1230
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:54,620
you've got data you've got some inputs
 

1231
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,760
you've got data you've got some inputs
for which you know the right outputs the

1232
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:57,770
for which you know the right outputs the
 

1233
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:01,060
for which you know the right outputs the
question is can you see the pattern

1234
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,070
question is can you see the pattern
 

1235
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:03,850
question is can you see the pattern
there can you figure out a way for a new

1236
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:03,860
there can you figure out a way for a new
 

1237
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:07,510
there can you figure out a way for a new
input which we haven't seen to to get

1238
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:07,520
input which we haven't seen to to get
 

1239
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,570
input which we haven't seen to to get
the to understand what the output will

1240
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:10,580
the to understand what the output will
 

1241
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,910
the to understand what the output will
be from that new input so we've got a

1242
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:12,920
be from that new input so we've got a
 

1243
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,200
be from that new input so we've got a
million inputs with their out

1244
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:15,210
million inputs with their out
 

1245
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:19,100
million inputs with their out
so we're trying to create some patterns

1246
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:19,110
so we're trying to create some patterns
 

1247
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:22,039
so we're trying to create some patterns
some rule that'll take those inputs

1248
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:22,049
some rule that'll take those inputs
 

1249
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:24,380
some rule that'll take those inputs
those million training inputs which we

1250
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:24,390
those million training inputs which we
 

1251
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,810
those million training inputs which we
know about to the correct million

1252
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:26,820
know about to the correct million
 

1253
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:32,419
know about to the correct million
outputs and this idea of a neural net is

1254
00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:32,429
outputs and this idea of a neural net is
 

1255
00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:36,889
outputs and this idea of a neural net is
part of the structure of the of our new

1256
00:30:36,889 --> 00:30:36,899
part of the structure of the of our new
 

1257
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:40,820
part of the structure of the of our new
way to create a create a rule we're

1258
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:40,830
way to create a create a rule we're
 

1259
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:44,060
way to create a create a rule we're
looking for a rule that will take these

1260
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:44,070
looking for a rule that will take these
 

1261
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:48,409
looking for a rule that will take these
training inputs to the known outputs and

1262
00:30:48,409 --> 00:30:48,419
training inputs to the known outputs and
 

1263
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:50,960
training inputs to the known outputs and
then we're going to use that rule on new

1264
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:50,970
then we're going to use that rule on new
 

1265
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:54,350
then we're going to use that rule on new
inputs that we don't know the output and

1266
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:54,360
inputs that we don't know the output and
 

1267
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,960
inputs that we don't know the output and
see what comes the linear algebra is a

see what comes the linear algebra is a
 

1269
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:58,970
see what comes the linear algebra is a
big part of defining a finding that rule

big part of defining a finding that rule
 

1271
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,159
big part of defining a finding that rule
that's right linear algebra is a big

00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:01,169
that's right linear algebra is a big
 

1273
00:31:01,169 --> 00:31:03,980
that's right linear algebra is a big
part not all the part people were

linear is something special

1278
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:10,140
linear is something special
 

1279
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,590
linear is something special
it's all about straight lines and flat

1280
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:12,600
it's all about straight lines and flat
 

1281
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:17,750
it's all about straight lines and flat
planes and and and data isn't quite like

1282
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:17,760
planes and and and data isn't quite like
 

1283
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,810
planes and and and data isn't quite like
that you know it's it's more complicated

1284
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:20,820
that you know it's it's more complicated
 

1285
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,340
that you know it's it's more complicated
so you got to introduce some

1286
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:22,350
so you got to introduce some
 

1287
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,860
so you got to introduce some
complication so you have to have some

1288
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:24,870
complication so you have to have some
 

1289
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:27,320
complication so you have to have some
function that's not a straight line and

1290
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:27,330
function that's not a straight line and
 

1291
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:30,320
function that's not a straight line and
it not only doubt it on linear nonlinear

1292
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:30,330
it not only doubt it on linear nonlinear
 

1293
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,930
it not only doubt it on linear nonlinear
nonlinear and it turned out that the it

1294
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:32,940
nonlinear and it turned out that the it
 

1295
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,990
nonlinear and it turned out that the it
was enough to use the function that's

1296
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:36,000
was enough to use the function that's
 

1297
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,700
was enough to use the function that's
one straight line and then a different

1298
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:37,710
one straight line and then a different
 

1299
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:41,480
one straight line and then a different
one halfway that's so piecewise then he

1300
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:41,490
one halfway that's so piecewise then he
 

1301
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:44,810
one halfway that's so piecewise then he
said one piece has one slope one piece

1302
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:44,820
said one piece has one slope one piece
 

1303
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,860
said one piece has one slope one piece
the other piece has the second slope and

1304
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:47,870
the other piece has the second slope and
 

1305
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:51,200
the other piece has the second slope and
so that introduced getting that

1306
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:51,210
so that introduced getting that
 

1307
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:55,460
so that introduced getting that

1311
00:31:57,539 --> 00:31:59,450
the problem open that little piece makes
it sufficiently complicated to make

00:31:59,450 --> 00:31:59,460
it sufficiently complicated to make
 

1313
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,950
it sufficiently complicated to make
things interesting because you're gonna

1314
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:00,960
things interesting because you're gonna
 

1315
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,169
things interesting because you're gonna
use that piece over and over a million

1316
00:32:03,169 --> 00:32:03,179
use that piece over and over a million
 

1317
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:06,019
use that piece over and over a million
times so you so you it has a it has a

1318
00:32:06,019 --> 00:32:06,029
times so you so you it has a it has a
 

1319
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:09,049

and but when you fold something a

1324
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:12,270
and but when you fold something a
 

1325
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,799
and but when you fold something a

1327
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:17,960

pretty complicated function that's

1328
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:17,970
pretty complicated function that's
 

1329
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,880
pretty complicated function that's
pretty realistic so that's the thing

1330
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:19,890
pretty realistic so that's the thing
 

1331
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:22,789

about neural networks is they have a lot

1332
00:32:22,789 --> 00:32:22,799
about neural networks is they have a lot
 

1333
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,240
about neural networks is they have a lot
of these a lot of these that's so why do

1334
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:26,250
of these a lot of these that's so why do
 

1335
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,970
of these a lot of these that's so why do
you think neural networks

1336
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:28,980
you think neural networks
 

1337
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:33,230
you think neural networks
by using a sort of formulating an

00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:33,240
by using a sort of formulating an
 

1339
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:37,360
by using a sort of formulating an

1345
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,750

work to be able to find a rule that we

1346
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:47,760
work to be able to find a rule that we
 

1347
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,750
work to be able to find a rule that we
don't know is optimal but it just seems

1348
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:50,760
don't know is optimal but it just seems
 

1349
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,509
don't know is optimal but it just seems
to be pretty good in a lot of cases

1350
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:52,519
to be pretty good in a lot of cases

00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:29,129
just computational limits it you you
 

1415
00:34:29,129 --> 00:34:32,480
just computational limits it you you
know you the problem beyond a certain

1416
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:32,490
know you the problem beyond a certain
 

1417
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:35,450
know you the problem beyond a certain
size a supercomputer isn't going to do

1418
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:35,460
size a supercomputer isn't going to do
 

1419
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:38,690
size a supercomputer isn't going to do
it but that does keep getting more

1420
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:38,700
it but that does keep getting more
 

1421
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:42,180
it but that does keep getting more
powerful so that's that limit has been

1422
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:42,190
powerful so that's that limit has been
 

1423
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:46,309
powerful so that's that limit has been
moved to allow more and more complicated

1424
00:34:46,309 --> 00:34:46,319
moved to allow more and more complicated
 

1425
00:34:46,319 --> 00:34:50,419
moved to allow more and more complicated
surfaces so in terms of just mapping

1426
00:34:50,419 --> 00:34:50,429
surfaces so in terms of just mapping
 

1427
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:53,369
surfaces so in terms of just mapping
from inputs to the outputs looking at

1428
00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:53,379
from inputs to the outputs looking at
 

1429
00:34:53,379 --> 00:34:58,050
from inputs to the outputs looking at
data yeah what do you think of you know

1430
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:58,060
data yeah what do you think of you know
 

1431
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,510
data yeah what do you think of you know
in a context in your networks in general

1432
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:00,520
in a context in your networks in general
 

1433
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,940
in a context in your networks in general
data is just tensor vectors matrices

1434
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:02,950
data is just tensor vectors matrices
 

1435
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:07,440
data is just tensor vectors matrices
tensors how do you think about learning

1436
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:07,450
tensors how do you think about learning
 

1437
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:11,520
tensors how do you think about learning
from data what how much of our world can

1438
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:11,530
from data what how much of our world can
 

1439
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:13,890
from data what how much of our world can
be expressed in this way how useful is

1440
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:13,900
be expressed in this way how useful is
 

1441
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:17,099
be expressed in this way how useful is
this process is the I guess that's

1442
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:17,109
this process is the I guess that's
 

1443
00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:18,329
this process is the I guess that's
another way to asking what are the

1444
00:35:18,329 --> 00:35:18,339
another way to asking what are the
 

1445
00:35:18,339 --> 00:35:20,010
another way to asking what are the
limits of this well that's a good

1446
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:20,020
limits of this well that's a good
 

1447
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,980
limits of this well that's a good
question yeah so I guess the whole idea

1448
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:22,990
question yeah so I guess the whole idea
 

1449
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,630
question yeah so I guess the whole idea
of deep learning is that there's

1450
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:24,640
of deep learning is that there's
 

1451
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,059
of deep learning is that there's
something there to learn if the data is

1452
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:27,069
something there to learn if the data is
 

1453
00:35:27,069 --> 00:35:29,819
something there to learn if the data is
totally random just produced by random

1454
00:35:29,819 --> 00:35:29,829
totally random just produced by random
 

1455
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:33,660
totally random just produced by random
number generators then the we're not

1456
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:33,670
number generators then the we're not
 

1457
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,390
number generators then the we're not
going to find a useful rule because

1458
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:36,400
going to find a useful rule because
 

1459
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,710
going to find a useful rule because
there isn't one so the extreme of having

1460
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:40,720
there isn't one so the extreme of having
 

1461
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,260
there isn't one so the extreme of having
a rule is like knowing Newton's law you

1462
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:43,270
a rule is like knowing Newton's law you
 

1463
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:45,480
a rule is like knowing Newton's law you
know if you hit a hit a ball and moves

1464
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:45,490
know if you hit a hit a ball and moves
 

1465
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:48,780
know if you hit a hit a ball and moves
so that's where you had laws of physics

1466
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:48,790
so that's where you had laws of physics
 

1467
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:52,680
so that's where you had laws of physics
Newton and and Einstein and other great

1468
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:52,690
Newton and and Einstein and other great
 

1469
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:56,040
Newton and and Einstein and other great
great people have have found those laws

1470
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,050
great people have have found those laws
 

1471
00:35:56,050 --> 00:36:03,030
great people have have found those laws
and laws of the the the distribution of

1472
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:03,040
and laws of the the the distribution of
 

1473
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,359
and laws of the the the distribution of
oil in a underground thing I mean that

1474
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:06,369
oil in a underground thing I mean that
 

1475
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:11,660
oil in a underground thing I mean that
so so engineers petroleum engineers and

1476
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:11,670
so so engineers petroleum engineers and
 

1477
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,870
so so engineers petroleum engineers and
understand how how oil will sit in a in

1478
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:15,880
understand how how oil will sit in a in
 

1479
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,470
understand how how oil will sit in a in
an underground basin so there were rules

1480
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:19,480
an underground basin so there were rules
 

1481
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,819
an underground basin so there were rules
now now the the new idea of artificial

1482
00:36:23,819 --> 00:36:23,829
now now the the new idea of artificial
 

1483
00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:27,120
now now the the new idea of artificial
intelligence is learn the rules instead

1484
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:27,130
intelligence is learn the rules instead
 

1485
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:29,640
intelligence is learn the rules instead
of instead of figuring out the rules by

1486
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:29,650
of instead of figuring out the rules by
 

1487
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:32,849
of instead of figuring out the rules by
with help from Newton or Einstein the

1488
00:36:32,849 --> 00:36:32,859
with help from Newton or Einstein the
 

1489
00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:35,730
with help from Newton or Einstein the
computer is looking for the rules so

1490
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:35,740
computer is looking for the rules so
 

1491
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,890
computer is looking for the rules so
that's another step but if there are no

1492
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:37,900
that's another step but if there are no
 

1493
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,770
that's another step but if there are no
rules at all for that the computer could

1494
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:40,780
rules at all for that the computer could
 

1495
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:44,010
rules at all for that the computer could
find if it's totally random data well

1496
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:44,020
find if it's totally random data well
 

1497
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,400
find if it's totally random data well
you've got nothing you've got no science

1498
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:46,410
you've got nothing you've got no science
 

1499
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:49,470
you've got nothing you've got no science
to discover it's the automated search

1500
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:49,480
to discover it's the automated search
 

1501
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,839
to discover it's the automated search
for the underlying rules yeah

1502
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:51,849
for the underlying rules yeah
 

1503
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:53,980
for the underlying rules yeah
search for the rules yeah

1504
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:53,990
search for the rules yeah
 

1505
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:56,080
search for the rules yeah
exactly yeah there will be a lot of

1506
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,090
exactly yeah there will be a lot of
 

1507
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:59,140
exactly yeah there will be a lot of
random parts a lot I'm not knocking

1508
00:36:59,140 --> 00:36:59,150
random parts a lot I'm not knocking
 

1509
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:03,660
random parts a lot I'm not knocking
random because the that's there the the

1510
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:03,670
random because the that's there the the
 

1511
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:07,210
random because the that's there the the
the there's a lot of randomness built in

1512
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:07,220
the there's a lot of randomness built in
 

1513
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,430
the there's a lot of randomness built in
but there's got to be some basic it's

1514
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:09,440
but there's got to be some basic it's
 

1515
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,230
but there's got to be some basic it's
almost always signature right in most

1516
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:11,240
almost always signature right in most
 

1517
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,850
almost always signature right in most
there's got to be some signal yeah if

1518
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:12,860
there's got to be some signal yeah if
 

1519
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,700
there's got to be some signal yeah if
it's all noise then there's there's

1520
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:15,710
it's all noise then there's there's
 

1521
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,200
it's all noise then there's there's
you're not gonna get it anywhere

1522
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:17,210
you're not gonna get it anywhere
 

1523
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:19,240
you're not gonna get it anywhere
well this world around us does seem to

1524
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:19,250
well this world around us does seem to
 

1525
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,550
well this world around us does seem to
be this seem to always have a signal

1526
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:21,560
be this seem to always have a signal
 

1527
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,040
be this seem to always have a signal
some kind yeah yeah they discovered

1528
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,050
some kind yeah yeah they discovered
 

1529
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:27,830
some kind yeah yeah they discovered
right that's it so

1530
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:27,840
right that's it so
 

1531
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,070
right that's it so
what excites you more the we just talked

1532
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:31,080
what excites you more the we just talked
 

1533
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,960
what excites you more the we just talked
about a little bit of application what

1534
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:32,970
about a little bit of application what
 

1535
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:36,020
about a little bit of application what
excites me more theory or the

1536
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:36,030
excites me more theory or the
 

1537
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:40,400
excites me more theory or the
application of mathematics well for

1538
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:40,410
application of mathematics well for
 

1539
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:43,370
application of mathematics well for
myself I'm probably a theory person I'm

1540
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:43,380
myself I'm probably a theory person I'm
 

1541
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:47,300
myself I'm probably a theory person I'm
not I'm speaking here pretty freely

1542
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:47,310
not I'm speaking here pretty freely
 

1543
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:51,830
not I'm speaking here pretty freely
about applications but I'm not a person

1544
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:51,840
about applications but I'm not a person
 

1545
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,830
about applications but I'm not a person
who really I'm not a physicist or a

1546
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:54,840
who really I'm not a physicist or a
 

1547
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:59,120
who really I'm not a physicist or a
chemist or a neuroscientist so for

1548
00:37:59,120 --> 00:37:59,130
chemist or a neuroscientist so for
 

1549
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:03,940
chemist or a neuroscientist so for
myself I like this structure and this

1550
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:03,950
myself I like this structure and this
 

1551
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:09,110
myself I like this structure and this
flat subspaces and and and the relation

1552
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:09,120
flat subspaces and and and the relation
 

1553
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,280
flat subspaces and and and the relation
of matrices columns to rows that's my

1554
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:13,290
of matrices columns to rows that's my
 

1555
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:18,920
of matrices columns to rows that's my
part in the spectrum so the really

1556
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:18,930
part in the spectrum so the really
 

1557
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:22,720
part in the spectrum so the really
science is a big spectrum of people from

1558
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:22,730
science is a big spectrum of people from
 

1559
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:25,820
science is a big spectrum of people from
asking practical practical questions and

1560
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:25,830
asking practical practical questions and
 

1561
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:29,390
asking practical practical questions and
answering them using some math than some

1562
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:29,400
answering them using some math than some
 

1563
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,020
answering them using some math than some
math guys like myself or in the middle

1564
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:33,030
math guys like myself or in the middle
 

1565
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:38,330
math guys like myself or in the middle
of it and then the geniuses of math and

1566
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:38,340
of it and then the geniuses of math and
 

1567
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,970
of it and then the geniuses of math and
physics and chemistry and who are

1568
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:40,980
physics and chemistry and who are
 

1569
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,270
physics and chemistry and who are
finding fundamental rules and doing

1570
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:44,280
finding fundamental rules and doing
 

1571
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:50,890
finding fundamental rules and doing
doing really understanding nature that's

1572
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:50,900
doing really understanding nature that's
 

1573
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:55,520
doing really understanding nature that's
at its lowest simplest level maybe just

1574
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:55,530
at its lowest simplest level maybe just
 

1575
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,710
at its lowest simplest level maybe just
a quick in broad strokes from your

1576
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:57,720
a quick in broad strokes from your
 

1577
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,190
a quick in broad strokes from your
perspective what is uh where does the

1578
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:01,200
perspective what is uh where does the
 

1579
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,860
perspective what is uh where does the
linear algebra sit as a subfield of

1580
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:03,870
linear algebra sit as a subfield of
 

1581
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:06,080
linear algebra sit as a subfield of
mathematics what what are the various

1582
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,090
mathematics what what are the various
 

1583
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:09,250
mathematics what what are the various
subfields a year okay a you think about

1584
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:09,260
subfields a year okay a you think about
 

1585
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:12,820
subfields a year okay a you think about
in relation to linear algebra so the big

1586
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:12,830
in relation to linear algebra so the big
 

1587
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:18,140
in relation to linear algebra so the big
fields of math or algebra as a whole and

1588
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:18,150
fields of math or algebra as a whole and
 

1589
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:20,390
fields of math or algebra as a whole and
problems like calculus and differential

1590
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:20,400
problems like calculus and differential
 

1591
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,090
problems like calculus and differential
equations so that's a second quite

1592
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:23,100
equations so that's a second quite
 

1593
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,170
equations so that's a second quite
different field then maybe geometry

1594
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:26,180
different field then maybe geometry
 

1595
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,880
different field then maybe geometry
deserves to be under sort of as a

1596
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:28,890
deserves to be under sort of as a
 

1597
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:30,770
deserves to be under sort of as a
different field to understand the

1598
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:30,780
different field to understand the
 

1599
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:35,460
different field to understand the
geometry of high dimensional surfaces

1600
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:35,470
geometry of high dimensional surfaces
 

1601
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:39,270
geometry of high dimensional surfaces
so I think am I allowed to say this here

1602
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:39,280
so I think am I allowed to say this here
 

1603
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:45,510
so I think am I allowed to say this here
I think this is where personal view

1604
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:45,520
I think this is where personal view
 

1605
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:50,250
I think this is where personal view
comes and I think math for thinking

1606
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:50,260
comes and I think math for thinking
 

1607
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,980
comes and I think math for thinking
about undergraduate math what millions

1608
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:52,990
about undergraduate math what millions
 

1609
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:56,299
about undergraduate math what millions
of students study I think we overdo the

1610
00:39:56,299 --> 00:39:56,309
of students study I think we overdo the
 

1611
00:39:56,309 --> 00:40:00,660
of students study I think we overdo the
calculus at at the cost of the algebra

1612
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:00,670
calculus at at the cost of the algebra
 

1613
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:03,809
calculus at at the cost of the algebra
at the cost of linear dog titled

1614
00:40:03,809 --> 00:40:03,819
at the cost of linear dog titled
 

1615
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:07,079
at the cost of linear dog titled
calculus versus linear that's right and

1616
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:07,089
calculus versus linear that's right and
 

1617
00:40:07,089 --> 00:40:09,630
calculus versus linear that's right and
and you say that linear algebra wins so

1618
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:09,640
and you say that linear algebra wins so
 

1619
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,420
and you say that linear algebra wins so
you can you want can you dig into that a

1620
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:12,430
you can you want can you dig into that a
 

1621
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,380
you can you want can you dig into that a
little bit

1622
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:13,390
little bit
 

1623
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:17,700
little bit
why does linear algebra win right well

1624
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:17,710
why does linear algebra win right well
 

1625
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:21,270
why does linear algebra win right well
ok I'm the viewer is gonna think this

1626
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:21,280
ok I'm the viewer is gonna think this
 

1627
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,470
ok I'm the viewer is gonna think this
guy is biased not true I'm just telling

1628
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:25,480
guy is biased not true I'm just telling
 

1629
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,680
guy is biased not true I'm just telling
the truth as it is yeah so I feel linear

1630
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:28,690
the truth as it is yeah so I feel linear
 

1631
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:31,740
the truth as it is yeah so I feel linear
algebra is just a nice part of math that

1632
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:31,750
algebra is just a nice part of math that
 

1633
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:34,740
algebra is just a nice part of math that
people can get the idea of they can

1634
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:34,750
people can get the idea of they can
 

1635
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:37,049
people can get the idea of they can
understand something it's a little bit

1636
00:40:37,049 --> 00:40:37,059
understand something it's a little bit
 

1637
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:39,420
understand something it's a little bit
abstract because once you get to ten or

1638
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:39,430
abstract because once you get to ten or
 

1639
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:43,680
abstract because once you get to ten or
a hundred dimensions and very very very

1640
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:43,690
a hundred dimensions and very very very
 

1641
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:46,710
a hundred dimensions and very very very
useful that's what's happened in in my

1642
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:46,720
useful that's what's happened in in my
 

1643
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,329
useful that's what's happened in in my
lifetime is the the the importance of

1644
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:51,339
lifetime is the the the importance of
 

1645
00:40:51,339 --> 00:40:54,750
lifetime is the the the importance of
data which does come in matrix form so

1646
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:54,760
data which does come in matrix form so
 

1647
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,910
data which does come in matrix form so
it's really set up for algebra it's not

1648
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:56,920
it's really set up for algebra it's not
 

1649
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,799
it's really set up for algebra it's not
set up for a differential equation and

1650
00:40:58,799 --> 00:40:58,809
set up for a differential equation and
 

1651
00:40:58,809 --> 00:41:02,940
set up for a differential equation and
now let me fairly add probability

1652
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:02,950
now let me fairly add probability
 

1653
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:05,730
now let me fairly add probability
they're ideas of probability and

1654
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:05,740
they're ideas of probability and
 

1655
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:08,490
they're ideas of probability and
statistics have become very very

1656
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:08,500
statistics have become very very
 

1657
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,430
statistics have become very very
important i've also jumped forward so

1658
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:11,440
important i've also jumped forward so
 

1659
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,170
important i've also jumped forward so
and that's not that's different from

1660
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:13,180
and that's not that's different from
 

1661
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,660
and that's not that's different from
linear algebra quite different so now we

1662
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:15,670
linear algebra quite different so now we
 

1663
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:19,760
linear algebra quite different so now we
really have three major areas to me

1664
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:19,770
really have three major areas to me
 

1665
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:26,539
really have three major areas to me
calculus linear algebra of matrices and

1666
00:41:26,539 --> 00:41:26,549
calculus linear algebra of matrices and
 

1667
00:41:26,549 --> 00:41:30,569
calculus linear algebra of matrices and
probability statistics and they all

1668
00:41:30,569 --> 00:41:30,579
probability statistics and they all
 

1669
00:41:30,579 --> 00:41:34,559
probability statistics and they all
deserve a important place and and

1670
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:34,569
deserve a important place and and
 

1671
00:41:34,569 --> 00:41:38,569
deserve a important place and and
calculus has traditionally had a had a

1672
00:41:38,569 --> 00:41:38,579
calculus has traditionally had a had a
 

1673
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,769
calculus has traditionally had a had a
lion's share of the time and

1674
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:40,779
lion's share of the time and
 

1675
00:41:40,779 --> 00:41:41,880
lion's share of the time and
disproportionate share

1676
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:41,890
disproportionate share
 

1677
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:44,069
disproportionate share
yes but thank you proportionate that's a

1678
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:44,079
yes but thank you proportionate that's a
 

1679
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,250
yes but thank you proportionate that's a
good work

1680
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:45,260
good work

I know it's hard to pick favorites but

1686
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:55,900
I know it's hard to pick favorites but
 

1687
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,990
I know it's hard to pick favorites but
what is your favorite matrix what's my

1688
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:58,000
what is your favorite matrix what's my
 

1689
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,870
what is your favorite matrix what's my
favorite matrix okay so my favorite

1690
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:00,880
favorite matrix okay so my favorite
 

1691
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,900

down the main diagonal and on the next
 

1697
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,490
down the main diagonal and on the next

1698
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:14,500
diagonal so think of top left to bottom
 

1699
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,819

well all the different ways it comes up

1712
00:42:36,539 --> 00:42:36,549
well all the different ways it comes up
 

1713
00:42:36,549 --> 00:42:39,900
well all the different ways it comes up
you see it in engineering you see it as

00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:39,910
you see it in engineering you see it as
 

1715
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:42,900
you see it in engineering you see it as
analogous in calculus to second

1716
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:42,910
analogous in calculus to second
 

1717
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:45,660
analogous in calculus to second
derivative so calculus learns about

1718
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:45,670
derivative so calculus learns about
 

1719
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:48,120
derivative so calculus learns about
taking the derivative the figuring out

1720
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:48,130
taking the derivative the figuring out
 

1721
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:50,690
taking the derivative the figuring out
how much how fast something's changing

how much how fast something's changing
 

1723
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:54,599
how much how fast something's changing
but second derivative now that's also

1724
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:54,609
but second derivative now that's also
 

1725
00:42:54,609 --> 00:42:57,930
but second derivative now that's also
important that's how fast the change is

1726
00:42:57,930 --> 00:42:57,940
important that's how fast the change is
 

1727
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:01,710
important that's how fast the change is
changing how fast the graph is bending

1728
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:01,720
changing how fast the graph is bending
 

1729
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:07,230
changing how fast the graph is bending
how fast it's it's curving and my

1730
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:07,240
how fast it's it's curving and my
 

1731
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,079
how fast it's it's curving and my
Feinstein showed that that's fundamental

1732
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:10,089
Feinstein showed that that's fundamental
 

1733
00:43:10,089 --> 00:43:13,349
Feinstein showed that that's fundamental
to understand space so second

1734
00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:13,359
to understand space so second
 

1735
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,809
to understand space so second
derivatives should have a bigger place

1736
00:43:15,809 --> 00:43:15,819
derivatives should have a bigger place
 

1737
00:43:15,819 --> 00:43:21,120
derivatives should have a bigger place
in calculus second mice matrices which

1738
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:21,130
in calculus second mice matrices which
 

1739
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:25,079
in calculus second mice matrices which
are like the linear algebra version of

1740
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:25,089
are like the linear algebra version of
 

1741
00:43:25,089 --> 00:43:29,370
are like the linear algebra version of
second derivatives are neat in in linear

1742
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:29,380
second derivatives are neat in in linear
 

1743
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,420
second derivatives are neat in in linear
algebra yeah

1744
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:30,430
algebra yeah
 

1745
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:32,069
algebra yeah
just everything comes out right with

1746
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:32,079
just everything comes out right with
 

1747
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,970
just everything comes out right with
those guys beautiful what did you learn

1748
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:35,980
those guys beautiful what did you learn
 

1749
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,640
those guys beautiful what did you learn
about the process of learning by having

1750
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:38,650
about the process of learning by having
 

1751
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:41,970
about the process of learning by having
taught so many students math over the

1752
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:41,980
taught so many students math over the
 

1753
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:42,329
taught so many students math over the
years

1754
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:42,339
years
 

1755
00:43:42,339 --> 00:43:46,500
years
whoo that is hard I'll have to admit

1756
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:46,510
whoo that is hard I'll have to admit
 

1757
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:50,099
whoo that is hard I'll have to admit
here that I'm not I'm not really a good

1758
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:50,109
here that I'm not I'm not really a good
 

1759
00:43:50,109 --> 00:43:54,120
here that I'm not I'm not really a good
teacher because I don't get into the

1760
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:54,130
teacher because I don't get into the
 

1761
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:57,269
teacher because I don't get into the
exam part the exams the part of my life

1762
00:43:57,269 --> 00:43:57,279
exam part the exams the part of my life
 

1763
00:43:57,279 --> 00:44:00,329
exam part the exams the part of my life
that I don't like and grading them and

1764
00:44:00,329 --> 00:44:00,339
that I don't like and grading them and
 

1765
00:44:00,339 --> 00:44:04,140
that I don't like and grading them and
giving the students a or B or whatever I

1766
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:04,150
giving the students a or B or whatever I
 

1767
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:05,560
giving the students a or B or whatever I
do it

1768
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:05,570
do it
 

1769
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:09,210
do it
because it's I'm supposed to do it but

1770
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:09,220
because it's I'm supposed to do it but
 

1771
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,980
because it's I'm supposed to do it but
but I tell the class at the beginning I

1772
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:11,990
but I tell the class at the beginning I
 

1773
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:13,510
but I tell the class at the beginning I
don't know if they believe me probably

1774
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:13,520
don't know if they believe me probably
 

1775
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,510
don't know if they believe me probably
they don't I tell the class I'm here to

1776
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:16,520
they don't I tell the class I'm here to
 

1777
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,690
they don't I tell the class I'm here to
teach you I'm here to teach you math and

1778
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:19,700
teach you I'm here to teach you math and
 

1779
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,110
teach you I'm here to teach you math and
not to grade you and but they're

1780
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:23,120
not to grade you and but they're
 

1781
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,050
not to grade you and but they're
thinking okay this guy it's gonna you

1782
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:26,060
thinking okay this guy it's gonna you
 

1783
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,490
thinking okay this guy it's gonna you
know when's he gonna kids he's gonna

1784
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:27,500
know when's he gonna kids he's gonna
 

1785
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,620
know when's he gonna kids he's gonna
give me an A - is he gonna give me a

1786
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:29,630
give me an A - is he gonna give me a
 

1787
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:32,380
give me an A - is he gonna give me a
b-plus what what would have you learn

1788
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:32,390
b-plus what what would have you learn
 

1789
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:34,030
b-plus what what would have you learn
about the process of learning of

1790
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:34,040
about the process of learning of
 

1791
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,900
about the process of learning of
learning yeah well maybe to be elated to

1792
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:37,910
learning yeah well maybe to be elated to
 

1793
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:40,300
learning yeah well maybe to be elated to
give you a legitimate answer about

1794
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:40,310
give you a legitimate answer about
 

1795
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:42,880
give you a legitimate answer about
learning I should have paid more

1796
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:42,890
learning I should have paid more
 

1797
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:45,720
learning I should have paid more
attention to the assessment the

1798
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:45,730
attention to the assessment the
 

1799
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:48,220
attention to the assessment the
evaluation part at the end but I like

1800
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:48,230
evaluation part at the end but I like
 

1801
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:50,110
evaluation part at the end but I like
the teaching part at the start that's

1802
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:50,120
the teaching part at the start that's
 

1803
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,350
the teaching part at the start that's
the sexy part to tell somebody for the

1804
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:53,360
the sexy part to tell somebody for the
 

1805
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,140
the sexy part to tell somebody for the
first time about a matrix Wow but is

1806
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:56,150
first time about a matrix Wow but is
 

1807
00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:00,610
first time about a matrix Wow but is
there are there moments so you are

1808
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:00,620
there are there moments so you are
 

1809
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,770
there are there moments so you are
teaching a concept are there moments of

1810
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:02,780
teaching a concept are there moments of
 

1811
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:05,620
teaching a concept are there moments of
learning that you just see in the

1812
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:05,630
learning that you just see in the
 

1813
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:07,210
learning that you just see in the
students eyes you don't need to look at

1814
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:07,220
students eyes you don't need to look at
 

1815
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,010
students eyes you don't need to look at
the grades yeah you see in their eyes

1816
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:09,020
the grades yeah you see in their eyes
 

1817
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:13,240
the grades yeah you see in their eyes
that that you hooked them that you know

1818
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:13,250
that that you hooked them that you know
 

1819
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:15,580
that that you hooked them that you know
that you connect with them in a way

1820
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:15,590
that you connect with them in a way
 

1821
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:18,250
that you connect with them in a way
where you know what they fall in love

1822
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:18,260
where you know what they fall in love
 

1823
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,130
where you know what they fall in love
with this yes beautiful world amazing

1824
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:21,140
with this yes beautiful world amazing
 

1825
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:24,250
with this yes beautiful world amazing
see that it's got some beauty it's yeah

1826
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:24,260
see that it's got some beauty it's yeah
 

1827
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:27,340
see that it's got some beauty it's yeah
or conversely yeah that they give up at

1828
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:27,350
or conversely yeah that they give up at
 

1829
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:30,340
or conversely yeah that they give up at
that point is the opposite the darkest a

1830
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:30,350
that point is the opposite the darkest a
 

1831
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:32,440
that point is the opposite the darkest a
the math I'm just not good at math and

1832
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:32,450
the math I'm just not good at math and
 

1833
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:36,220
the math I'm just not good at math and
alcohol yeah yeah maybe because of the

1834
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:36,230
alcohol yeah yeah maybe because of the
 

1835
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:38,230
alcohol yeah yeah maybe because of the
approach in the past they were

1836
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:38,240
approach in the past they were
 

1837
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,940
approach in the past they were
discouraged but don't be discouraged

1838
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:39,950
discouraged but don't be discouraged
 

1839
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:46,150
discouraged but don't be discouraged
it's it's too good to miss yeah I well

1840
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:46,160
it's it's too good to miss yeah I well
 

1841
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,700
it's it's too good to miss yeah I well
if I'm teaching a big class do I know

1842
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:48,710
if I'm teaching a big class do I know
 

1843
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:53,190
if I'm teaching a big class do I know
when I think maybe I do sort of I

1844
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:53,200
when I think maybe I do sort of I
 

1845
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,250
when I think maybe I do sort of I
mentioned at the very start the four

1846
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:57,260
mentioned at the very start the four
 

1847
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:00,430
mentioned at the very start the four
fundamental subspaces and the structure

1848
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:00,440
fundamental subspaces and the structure
 

1849
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,310
fundamental subspaces and the structure
of the fundamental theorem of linear

1850
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:03,320
of the fundamental theorem of linear
 

1851
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,800
of the fundamental theorem of linear
algebra the fundamental theorem of

1852
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:05,810
algebra the fundamental theorem of
 

1853
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:09,070
algebra the fundamental theorem of
linear algebra that is the relation of

1854
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:09,080
linear algebra that is the relation of
 

1855
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,570
linear algebra that is the relation of
those four subspaces those four spaces

1856
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:12,580
those four subspaces those four spaces
 

1857
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:16,630
those four subspaces those four spaces
yeah so I think that I feel that the

1858
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:16,640
yeah so I think that I feel that the
 

1859
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,210
yeah so I think that I feel that the
class gets it when they want to see the

1860
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:19,220
class gets it when they want to see the
 

1861
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:22,329
class gets it when they want to see the
what advice do you have to a student

1862
00:46:22,329 --> 00:46:22,339
what advice do you have to a student
 

1863
00:46:22,339 --> 00:46:24,250
what advice do you have to a student
just starting their journey mathematics

1864
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:24,260
just starting their journey mathematics
 

1865
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:26,740
just starting their journey mathematics
today how do they get started

1866
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:26,750
today how do they get started
 

1867
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:31,720
today how do they get started
Oh No yeah that's hard well I hope you

1868
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:31,730
Oh No yeah that's hard well I hope you
 

1869
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:36,730
Oh No yeah that's hard well I hope you
have a teacher professor who is still

1870
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:36,740
have a teacher professor who is still
 

1871
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:40,120
have a teacher professor who is still
enjoying what he's doing and what he's

1872
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:40,130
enjoying what he's doing and what he's
 

1873
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,430
enjoying what he's doing and what he's
teaching they're still looking for new

1874
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:42,440
teaching they're still looking for new
 

1875
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:47,069
teaching they're still looking for new
ways to teach and and to understand math

1876
00:46:47,069 --> 00:46:47,079
ways to teach and and to understand math
 

1877
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:51,220
ways to teach and and to understand math
because that's the pleasure to the

1878
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:51,230
because that's the pleasure to the
 

1879
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:54,190
because that's the pleasure to the
moment when you see oh yeah that works

1880
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:54,200
moment when you see oh yeah that works
 

1881
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,309
moment when you see oh yeah that works
so it's s about the material you yeah

1882
00:46:57,309 --> 00:46:57,319
so it's s about the material you yeah
 

1883
00:46:57,319 --> 00:47:00,339
so it's s about the material you yeah
you study it's more about the source of

1884
00:47:00,339 --> 00:47:00,349
you study it's more about the source of
 

1885
00:47:00,349 --> 00:47:04,059
you study it's more about the source of
the teacher being full of passion yeah

1886
00:47:04,059 --> 00:47:04,069
the teacher being full of passion yeah
 

1887
00:47:04,069 --> 00:47:07,930
the teacher being full of passion yeah
more about the fun yeah there's a moment

1888
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:07,940
more about the fun yeah there's a moment
 

1889
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:12,450
more about the fun yeah there's a moment
of of getting it but in terms of topics

1890
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:12,460
of of getting it but in terms of topics
 

1891
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:16,270
of of getting it but in terms of topics
linear algebra well that's not my topic

1892
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:16,280
linear algebra well that's not my topic
 

1893
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,120
linear algebra well that's not my topic
but oh there's beautiful things in

1894
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:19,130
but oh there's beautiful things in
 

1895
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:21,640
but oh there's beautiful things in
geometry to understand what's wonderful

1896
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:21,650
geometry to understand what's wonderful
 

1897
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:26,079
geometry to understand what's wonderful
is that in the end there there's a

1898
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:26,089
is that in the end there there's a
 

1899
00:47:26,089 --> 00:47:28,780
is that in the end there there's a
pattern there there's their rules that

1900
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:28,790
pattern there there's their rules that
 

1901
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:34,150
pattern there there's their rules that
that that are followed in biology as

1902
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:34,160
that that are followed in biology as
 

1903
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:40,859
that that are followed in biology as
there are in every field you describe

1904
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:40,869

 

1905

t--'s linear algebra course that I

1922
00:48:08,279 --> 00:48:08,289
t--'s linear algebra course that I
 

1923
00:48:08,289 --> 00:48:10,499
t--'s linear algebra course that I
started so sort of there's a good
