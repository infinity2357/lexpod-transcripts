you know it's still

1052
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:22,400
you know it's still
 

1053
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,029
you know it's still
it's still strange to me that there was

1054
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:25,039
it's still strange to me that there was
 

1055
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,549
it's still strange to me that there was
not more betrayal

1056

not more betrayal
 

1057
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,710
not more betrayal
it speaks to something else perhaps

1058
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:28,720
it speaks to something else perhaps
 

1059
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,750
it speaks to something else perhaps
that's bigger than money

1060
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:31,760
that's bigger than money
 

1061
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,029
that's bigger than money
maybe maybe not but it seems like just

1062
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:35,039
maybe maybe not but it seems like just
 

1063
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,510
maybe maybe not but it seems like just
like in the casino like you mentioned

1064
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:37,520
like in the casino like you mentioned
 

1065
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,710
like in the casino like you mentioned
uh we um get accustomed to the

1066
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:40,720
uh we um get accustomed to the
 

1067
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,230
uh we um get accustomed to the
whatever level of money we have we get

1068
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:42,240
whatever level of money we have we get
 

1069
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,549
whatever level of money we have we get
accustomed very quickly yes

1070
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:44,559
accustomed very quickly yes
 

1071
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,710
accustomed very quickly yes
and then there's a tension that's

1072
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:46,720
and then there's a tension that's
 

1073
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,110
and then there's a tension that's
natural between human beings

1074
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,120
natural between human beings
 

1075
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,909
natural between human beings
and when that tension combined with

1076
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:51,919
and when that tension combined with
 

1077
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:52,549
and when that tension combined with
money

1078
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:52,559
money
 

1079
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,510
money
combined with power combined with like

1080
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:55,520
combined with power combined with like
 

1081
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:55,990
combined with power combined with like
you mentioned

1082
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,000
you mentioned
 

1083
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,590

beautiful women and a bit of violence
 

1085
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,950
beautiful women and a bit of violence
it seems that um betrayal should be

1086
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:02,960
it seems that um betrayal should be
 

1087
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,470
it seems that um betrayal should be
commonplace

1088
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:04,480
commonplace
 

1089
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,950
commonplace
but it's not it was not at all like

1090
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:06,960
but it's not it was not at all like
 

1091
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,070
but it's not it was not at all like

1505
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,590

what was the hardest part about flying

1506
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:47,600
what was the hardest part about flying
 

1507
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,870
what was the hardest part about flying
those routes

those routes
 

1509
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,070
those routes
the hardest part was getting good

1510
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,080
the hardest part was getting good
