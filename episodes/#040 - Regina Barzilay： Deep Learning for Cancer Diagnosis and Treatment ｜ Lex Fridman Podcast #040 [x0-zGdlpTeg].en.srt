despite the fact that I am in the
business of science really opened my

90
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:56,390
business of science really opened my
 

91
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,820
business of science really opened my
eyes on how imprecise and imperfect the

92
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:00,830
eyes on how imprecise and imperfect the
 

93
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,000
eyes on how imprecise and imperfect the
discovery process is and how imperfect

94
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,010
discovery process is and how imperfect
 

95
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,710
discovery process is and how imperfect
our current solutions and what makes

96
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:07,720
our current solutions and what makes
 

97
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,110
our current solutions and what makes
science succeed and be implemented and

98
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,120
science succeed and be implemented and
 

99
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,820
science succeed and be implemented and
sometimes it's actually known the

100
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:12,830
sometimes it's actually known the
 

101
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,890
sometimes it's actually known the
strengths of the idea but devotion of

102
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:14,900
strengths of the idea but devotion of
 

103
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,150
strengths of the idea but devotion of
the person who wants to see it

104
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,160
the person who wants to see it
 

105
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,729
the person who wants to see it
implemented so this is one of the books

106
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:18,739
implemented so this is one of the books
 

107
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,890
implemented so this is one of the books
and you know at least for the last year

108
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:20,900
and you know at least for the last year
 

109
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,340
and you know at least for the last year
quite changed the way I'm thinking about

110
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:23,350
quite changed the way I'm thinking about
 

111
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,390
quite changed the way I'm thinking about
scientific process just from the

112
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:25,400
scientific process just from the
 

113
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,120
scientific process just from the
historical perspective and what do I

114
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,130
historical perspective and what do I
 

115
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:31,920
historical perspective and what do I
need to do to make my ideas really

116
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:31,930
need to do to make my ideas really
 

117
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,840
need to do to make my ideas really
implemented let me give you an example

118
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:34,850
implemented let me give you an example
 

119
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:38,530
implemented let me give you an example

she interacts with the other students
with American students and he discovers

180

with American students and he discovers
 

181
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,630
with American students and he discovers
that actually she talked to her this way

182

that actually she talked to her this way
 

183
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,440
that actually she talked to her this way
because she saw that she doesn't

literally within few weeks I went to to
 

191
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,290
literally within few weeks I went to to
LA to a conference and they asked

192
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:22,300
LA to a conference and they asked
 

193
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,510
LA to a conference and they asked
somebody in the airport you know how to

194

somebody in the airport you know how to
 

195
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,060
somebody in the airport you know how to
find like a cab or something and then I

196
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,070
find like a cab or something and then I
 

197
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,550
find like a cab or something and then I
noticed this person is talking in a very

198
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:29,560
noticed this person is talking in a very
 

199
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,560
noticed this person is talking in a very
strange way and my first thought was and

200
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:31,570
strange way and my first thought was and
 

201
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,030
strange way and my first thought was and
this person have some you know

202
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
this person have some you know
 

203
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,490
this person have some you know
pronunciation issues or something and

I'm trying to talk very slowly to him an

206
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:37,240
I'm trying to talk very slowly to him an
 

207
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,580
I'm trying to talk very slowly to him an
average with another professor and

208
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:38,590
average with another professor and
 

209
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,730
average with another professor and
Frankel and he's like laughing because

210
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:41,740
Frankel and he's like laughing because
 

211
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,400
Frankel and he's like laughing because
it's funny that I don't get that the guy

212
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:44,410
it's funny that I don't get that the guy
 

213
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,110
it's funny that I don't get that the guy
is talking it in this way because he

214
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:46,120
is talking it in this way because he
 

215
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,370
is talking it in this way because he
think that I cannot speak so it was

216
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:47,380
think that I cannot speak so it was
 

217
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,190
think that I cannot speak so it was
really kind of mirroring experience as

218
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:50,200
really kind of mirroring experience as
 

219
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,120
really kind of mirroring experience as
it is let me think a lot about my own

220
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,130
it is let me think a lot about my own
 

221
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,570
it is let me think a lot about my own
experiences moving

222
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:55,580
experiences moving
 

223
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,130
experiences moving
you know from different countries so I

224
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:57,140
you know from different countries so I
 

225
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,640
you know from different countries so I
think that books play a big role in my

226
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:00,650
think that books play a big role in my
 

227
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,670
think that books play a big role in my
understanding of the world on the on the

228
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:03,680
understanding of the world on the on the
 

229
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,550
understanding of the world on the on the
science question you mentioned that it

230
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:06,560
science question you mentioned that it
 

231
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,710
science question you mentioned that it
made you discover that personalities of

232
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:08,720
made you discover that personalities of
 

233
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,440
made you discover that personalities of
human beings are more important than

234
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:11,450
human beings are more important than
 

235
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,780
human beings are more important than
perhaps ideas is that what I heard it's

236
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:13,790
perhaps ideas is that what I heard it's
 

237
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,190
perhaps ideas is that what I heard it's
not necessarily that they are more

238
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:15,200
not necessarily that they are more
 

239
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,530
not necessarily that they are more
important than ideas but I think that

240
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:17,540
important than ideas but I think that
 

241
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,150
important than ideas but I think that
ideas on their own

242
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:19,160
ideas on their own
 

243
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,170
ideas on their own
unknown sufficient and many times at

unknown sufficient and many times at
 

245
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,030
unknown sufficient and many times at
least at the local horizon is the

00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:25,040
least at the local horizon is the
 

247
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,700
least at the local horizon is the
personalities and their devotion to

248
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:27,710
personalities and their devotion to
 

249
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,700
personalities and their devotion to
their ideas is really the locally

changes the landscape now if you're

252
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:33,530
changes the landscape now if you're
 

253
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,010
changes the landscape now if you're
looking at AI like let's say 30 years

254
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:36,020
looking at AI like let's say 30 years
 

255
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,570
looking at AI like let's say 30 years
ago

256
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:36,580
ago
 

257

you know Dark Ages of AI or whatever

258
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,110
you know Dark Ages of AI or whatever
 

259
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,960
you know Dark Ages of AI or whatever
what the symbolic times you can use

260
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:40,970
what the symbolic times you can use
 

261
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:44,590
what the symbolic times you can use
anyone you know there is some people now

262
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:44,600
anyone you know there is some people now
 

263
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,750
anyone you know there is some people now
we're looking at a lot of that work and

264
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:46,760
we're looking at a lot of that work and
 

265
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,920
we're looking at a lot of that work and
we're kind of thinking this is not

266
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:47,930
we're kind of thinking this is not
 

267
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,950
we're kind of thinking this is not
really maybe a relevant work but you can

268
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:50,960
really maybe a relevant work but you can
 

269
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,050
really maybe a relevant work but you can
see that some people manage to take it

270
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:53,060
see that some people manage to take it
 

271
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,070
see that some people manage to take it
and to make it so shiny and dominate the

272
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,080
and to make it so shiny and dominate the
 

273
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,400
and to make it so shiny and dominate the
you know the academic world and make it

274
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:00,410
you know the academic world and make it
 

275
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,130
you know the academic world and make it
to be the standards if you look in the

276
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:03,140
to be the standards if you look in the
 

277
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,460
to be the standards if you look in the
area of natural language processing it

278
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:06,470
area of natural language processing it
 

279
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,410
area of natural language processing it
is well known fact and the reason the

280
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:08,420
is well known fact and the reason the
 

281
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,110
is well known fact and the reason the
statistics in NLP took such a long time

282
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,120
statistics in NLP took such a long time
 

283
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,260
statistics in NLP took such a long time
to became to become mainstream because

284
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:14,270
to became to become mainstream because
 

285
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,880
to became to become mainstream because
there were quite a number of

286
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:15,890
there were quite a number of
 

287
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,710
there were quite a number of
personalities which didn't believe in

288
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:17,720
personalities which didn't believe in
 

289
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,230
personalities which didn't believe in
this idea and it stopped research

290
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:20,240
this idea and it stopped research
 

291
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,880
this idea and it stopped research
progress in this area so I do not think

292
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:24,890
progress in this area so I do not think
 

293
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,520
progress in this area so I do not think
that you know can asymptotically maybe

294
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:27,530
that you know can asymptotically maybe
 

295
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,210
that you know can asymptotically maybe
personalities matters but I think

296
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:30,220
personalities matters but I think
 

297
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,280
personalities matters but I think
locally it does make quite a bit of

298
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:33,290
locally it does make quite a bit of
 

299
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,210
locally it does make quite a bit of
impact okay generally you know speed

300
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:37,220
impact okay generally you know speed
 

301
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:37,870

speed up the rate of adoption of the new

00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:40,190
speed up the rate of adoption of the new
 

305
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,000
speed up the rate of adoption of the new
ideas yeah and and the other interesting

306
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,010
ideas yeah and and the other interesting
 

307
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,340
ideas yeah and and the other interesting
question is in the early days of

308
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:45,350
question is in the early days of
 

309
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,900
question is in the early days of
particular discipline I think you

310
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:46,910
particular discipline I think you
 

311
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:50,500
particular discipline I think you
mentioned in in that book was is

312
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:50,510
mentioned in in that book was is
 

313
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,810
mentioned in in that book was is
ultimately a book of cancer it's called

314
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:52,820
ultimately a book of cancer it's called
 

315
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,790
ultimately a book of cancer it's called
the Emperor of all maladies

316
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
the Emperor of all maladies
 

317
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,640
the Emperor of all maladies
yeah the yep and those maladies included

318
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:57,650
yeah the yep and those maladies included
 

319
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,950
yeah the yep and those maladies included
the trying to the medicine was the

320
00:06:59,950 --> 00:06:59,960
the trying to the medicine was the
 

321
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,760
the trying to the medicine was the
center arm so it was actually centered

322
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:03,770
center arm so it was actually centered
 

323
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,670
center arm so it was actually centered
on you know how people sort of curing

324
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:06,680
on you know how people sort of curing
 

325
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,950
on you know how people sort of curing
cancer like like for me it was really a

326
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:08,960
cancer like like for me it was really a
 

327
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,340
cancer like like for me it was really a
disc

328
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:09,350
disc
 

329
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,740
disc
how people what was the science of

330
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:11,750
how people what was the science of
 

331
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,200
how people what was the science of
chemistry behind drug development that

332
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,210
chemistry behind drug development that
 

333
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,020
chemistry behind drug development that
it actually grew up out of the dyeing

334
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,030
it actually grew up out of the dyeing
 

335
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,870
it actually grew up out of the dyeing
like coloring industry that people who

336
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:19,880
like coloring industry that people who
 

337
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,020
like coloring industry that people who
developed chemistry in 19th century in

338
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,030
developed chemistry in 19th century in
 

339
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:26,230
developed chemistry in 19th century in
Germany and Britain - do you know the

340
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
Germany and Britain - do you know the
 

341
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,020
Germany and Britain - do you know the
really new dyes they looked at the

342
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:29,030
really new dyes they looked at the
 

343
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,430
really new dyes they looked at the
molecular and identified it they do

344
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:30,440
molecular and identified it they do
 

345
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,190
molecular and identified it they do
certain things to cells and from there

346
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:33,200
certain things to cells and from there
 

347
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,050
certain things to cells and from there
the process started and you know like

348
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:35,060
the process started and you know like
 

349
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,460
the process started and you know like
histology thing yeah this is fascinating

350
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:36,470
histology thing yeah this is fascinating
 

351
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,530
histology thing yeah this is fascinating
that they managed to make the connection

352
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:38,540
that they managed to make the connection
 

353
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,960
that they managed to make the connection
and look under the microscope and do all

354
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:40,970
and look under the microscope and do all
 

355
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,210
and look under the microscope and do all
this discovery but as you continue

356
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:43,220
this discovery but as you continue
 

357
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,370
this discovery but as you continue
reading about it and you read about how

358
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:47,380
reading about it and you read about how
 

359
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,480
reading about it and you read about how
chemotherapy drugs socially developed in

360
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:49,490
chemotherapy drugs socially developed in
 

361
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,150
chemotherapy drugs socially developed in
Boston and some of them were developed

362
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,160
Boston and some of them were developed
 

363
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,650
Boston and some of them were developed
and Farber dr. Farber from Dana Farber

364
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:56,660
and Farber dr. Farber from Dana Farber
 

365
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,580
and Farber dr. Farber from Dana Farber
you know how the experiments were done

366
00:07:59,580 --> 00:07:59,590
you know how the experiments were done
 

367
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,280
you know how the experiments were done
that you know there was some

368
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:02,290
that you know there was some
 

369
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,630
that you know there was some
miscalculation let's put it this way and

370
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:04,640
miscalculation let's put it this way and
 

371
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,190
miscalculation let's put it this way and
they tried it on the patients and then

372
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:06,200
they tried it on the patients and then
 

373
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,750
they tried it on the patients and then
just and those were children with

374
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:07,760
just and those were children with
 

375
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,570
just and those were children with
leukemia and they died and they tried

376
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:10,580
leukemia and they died and they tried
 

377
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,100
leukemia and they died and they tried
another modification you look at the

378
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,110
another modification you look at the
 

379
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,050
another modification you look at the
process how imperfect is this process

380
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:14,060
process how imperfect is this process
 

381
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,230
process how imperfect is this process
and you don't like it well again looking

382
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:17,240
and you don't like it well again looking
 

383
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,270
and you don't like it well again looking
back like six years ago 70 years ago you

384
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:19,280
back like six years ago 70 years ago you
 

385
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,850
back like six years ago 70 years ago you
can kind of understand it but some of

386
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:21,860
can kind of understand it but some of
 

387
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,350
can kind of understand it but some of
the stories in this book which were

388
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,360
the stories in this book which were
 

389
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,140
the stories in this book which were
really shocking to me we're really

390
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:25,150
really shocking to me we're really
 

391
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,090
really shocking to me we're really
happening you know maybe decades ago and

392
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:28,100
happening you know maybe decades ago and
 

393
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,030
happening you know maybe decades ago and
we still don't have a vehicle to do it

394
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:31,040
we still don't have a vehicle to do it
 

395
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,900
we still don't have a vehicle to do it
much more fast and effective and you

396
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:34,910
much more fast and effective and you
 

397
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,219
much more fast and effective and you
know scientific the way of taking

398
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:36,229
know scientific the way of taking
 

399
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:38,830
know scientific the way of taking
computer science scientific so from the

400
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:38,840
computer science scientific so from the
 

401
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,540
computer science scientific so from the
perspective of computer science you've

402
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:40,550
perspective of computer science you've
 

403
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,300
perspective of computer science you've
gotten chance to work the application to

404
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:43,310
gotten chance to work the application to
 

405
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,160
gotten chance to work the application to
cancer and to medicine in general from a

406
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,170
cancer and to medicine in general from a
 

407
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,780
cancer and to medicine in general from a
perspective of an engineer and a

408
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:46,790
perspective of an engineer and a
 

409
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,570
perspective of an engineer and a
computer scientist how far along are we

410
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:49,580
computer scientist how far along are we
 

411
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,130
computer scientist how far along are we
from understanding the human body

412
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:51,140
from understanding the human body
 

413
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:55,120
from understanding the human body
biology of being able to manipulate it

414
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,130
biology of being able to manipulate it
 

415
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,460
biology of being able to manipulate it
in a way we can cure some of the

416
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:57,470
in a way we can cure some of the
 

417
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,250
in a way we can cure some of the
melodies some of the diseases so this is

418
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:00,260
melodies some of the diseases so this is
 

419
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:04,240
melodies some of the diseases so this is
very interesting question and if you're

420
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,250
very interesting question and if you're
 

421
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,220
very interesting question and if you're
thinking is a computer scientist about

422
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:06,230
thinking is a computer scientist about
 

423
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,430
thinking is a computer scientist about
this problem I think one of the reasons

424
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:09,440
this problem I think one of the reasons
 

425
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,160
this problem I think one of the reasons
that we succeeded in the areas we as a

426
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,170
that we succeeded in the areas we as a
 

427
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,560
that we succeeded in the areas we as a
computer scientist succeeded is because

428
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:14,570
computer scientist succeeded is because
 

429
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,230
computer scientist succeeded is because
we don't have we are not trying to

430
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:17,240
we don't have we are not trying to
 

431
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,480
we don't have we are not trying to
understand in some ways like if you're

432
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:19,490
understand in some ways like if you're
 

433
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,329
understand in some ways like if you're
thinking about like e-commerce Amazon I

434
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:22,339
thinking about like e-commerce Amazon I
 

435
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:22,610
thinking about like e-commerce Amazon I
was

436
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:22,620
was
 

437
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,560
was
doesn't really understand you and that's

438
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:24,570
doesn't really understand you and that's
 

439
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,950
doesn't really understand you and that's
why it recommends you certain books or

440
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:27,960
why it recommends you certain books or
 

441
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:33,410
why it recommends you certain books or
certain products correct and in you know

442
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:33,420
certain products correct and in you know
 

443
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,000
certain products correct and in you know
traditionally when people were thinking

444
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,010
traditionally when people were thinking
 

445
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,950
traditionally when people were thinking
about marketing you know they divided

446
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:36,960
about marketing you know they divided
 

447
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,660
about marketing you know they divided
the population to different kind of

448
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:38,670
the population to different kind of
 

449
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,210
the population to different kind of
subgroups identify the features of this

450
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:41,220
subgroups identify the features of this
 

451
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,770
subgroups identify the features of this
subgroup and come up with a strategy

452
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:42,780
subgroup and come up with a strategy
 

453
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,620
subgroup and come up with a strategy
which is specific to that subgroup if

454
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:45,630
which is specific to that subgroup if
 

455
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,970
which is specific to that subgroup if
you're looking about recommendation

456
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:46,980
you're looking about recommendation
 

457
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,280
you're looking about recommendation
system they're not claiming they

458
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:49,290
system they're not claiming they
 

459
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,140
system they're not claiming they
understanding somebody they're just

460
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:51,150
understanding somebody they're just
 

461
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,900
understanding somebody they're just
managing to from the patterns of your

462
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:53,910
managing to from the patterns of your
 

463
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,830
managing to from the patterns of your
behavior to recommend you a product now

464
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:57,840
behavior to recommend you a product now
 

465
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,600
behavior to recommend you a product now
if you look at the traditional Biogen

466
00:09:59,600 --> 00:09:59,610
if you look at the traditional Biogen
 

467
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,700
if you look at the traditional Biogen
obviously I wouldn't say that I at any

468
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:03,710
obviously I wouldn't say that I at any
 

469
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,260
obviously I wouldn't say that I at any
way you know educated in this field but

470
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:06,270
way you know educated in this field but
 

471
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,610
way you know educated in this field but
you know what I see there is really a

472
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:07,620
you know what I see there is really a
 

473
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,040
you know what I see there is really a
lot of emphasis on mechanistic

474
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,050
lot of emphasis on mechanistic
 

475
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,870
lot of emphasis on mechanistic
understanding and it was very surprising

476
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:11,880
understanding and it was very surprising
 

477
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,940
understanding and it was very surprising
to me coming from computer science how

478
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:13,950
to me coming from computer science how
 

479
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,460
to me coming from computer science how
much emphasis is on this understanding

480
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:16,470
much emphasis is on this understanding
 

481
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,420
much emphasis is on this understanding
and given the complexity of the system

482
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:20,430
and given the complexity of the system
 

483
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,430
and given the complexity of the system

understanding of this processes is you
know beyond our capacity and the same

00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:37,970
matching process and in some way maybe
 

497
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,360
matching process and in some way maybe
in certain cases we shouldn't even

in certain cases we shouldn't even
attempt to understand we can attempt to

00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:43,980
attempt to understand we can attempt to
 

501
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,920
attempt to understand we can attempt to
understand but in parallel we can

understand but in parallel we can
 

503
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,170
understand but in parallel we can
actually do this kind of matching that

actually do this kind of matching that
 

505
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,320
actually do this kind of matching that
would help us to find you out to do

00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:51,330
would help us to find you out to do
 

507
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:54,680
would help us to find you out to do
early diagnostics and so on and I know

early diagnostics and so on and I know
 

509
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,420

that in these communities it's really

that in these communities it's really

your mortality make you think about how
 

559
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:01,070
your mortality make you think about how
did they change you know this is a great

did they change you know this is a great
 

561
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,810
did they change you know this is a great
question and I think that I was

562
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:02,820
question and I think that I was
 

563
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,340
question and I think that I was
interviewed many times nobody actually

564
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:04,350
interviewed many times nobody actually
 

565
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:08,570
interviewed many times nobody actually
asked me this question I think I was 43

566
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:08,580
asked me this question I think I was 43
 

567
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,520
asked me this question I think I was 43
at a time and if the first time I

568
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:10,530
at a time and if the first time I
 

569
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,100
at a time and if the first time I
realized in my life that I may die and I

570
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,110
realized in my life that I may die and I
 

571
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,020
realized in my life that I may die and I
never thought about it before and yeah

572
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:15,030
never thought about it before and yeah
 

573
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,700
never thought about it before and yeah
and there was a long time since you

574
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:16,710
and there was a long time since you
 

575
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,810
and there was a long time since you
diagnosed until you're sure you know

576
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:17,820
diagnosed until you're sure you know
 

577
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,610
diagnosed until you're sure you know
what you have and have CV is your

578
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:19,620
what you have and have CV is your
 

579
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,070
what you have and have CV is your
disease for me it was like maybe two and

580
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:22,080
disease for me it was like maybe two and
 

581
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,640
disease for me it was like maybe two and
a half months and I didn't know where I

582
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:25,650
a half months and I didn't know where I
 

583
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,020
a half months and I didn't know where I
am

584
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,030
am
 

585
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,910
am
during this time because it was getting

586
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:28,920
during this time because it was getting
 

587
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,760
during this time because it was getting
different tests and one would say it's

588
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:31,770
different tests and one would say it's
 

589
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,530
different tests and one would say it's
bad and I would say no it is not so

590
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:33,540
bad and I would say no it is not so
 

591
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,720
bad and I would say no it is not so
until I knew where I am I really was

592
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:35,730
until I knew where I am I really was
 

593
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,710
until I knew where I am I really was
thinking about all these different

594
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:36,720
thinking about all these different
 

595
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,050
thinking about all these different
possible outcomes were you imagining the

596
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:39,060
possible outcomes were you imagining the
 

597
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,670
possible outcomes were you imagining the
worst or were you trying to be

598
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:40,680
worst or were you trying to be
 

599
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,390
worst or were you trying to be
optimistic or it would be really I don't

600
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:44,400
optimistic or it would be really I don't
 

601
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,060
optimistic or it would be really I don't
remember you know what was my thinking

602
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,070
remember you know what was my thinking
 

603
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,070
remember you know what was my thinking
it was really a mixture with many

604
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:49,080
it was really a mixture with many
 

605
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,800
it was really a mixture with many
components at the time at speaking you

606
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:51,810
components at the time at speaking you
 

607
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:57,770
components at the time at speaking you
know in our terms and one thing that I

608
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:57,780
know in our terms and one thing that I
 

609
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,710
know in our terms and one thing that I
remember and you know every test comes

610
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
remember and you know every test comes
 

611
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,450
remember and you know every test comes
and you're saying oh it could be this so

612
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:02,460
and you're saying oh it could be this so
 

613
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,890
and you're saying oh it could be this so
it may not be this and you're hopeful

614
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:03,900
it may not be this and you're hopeful
 

615
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,300
it may not be this and you're hopeful
then you're disparate so it's like if

616
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:05,310
then you're disparate so it's like if
 

617
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,070
then you're disparate so it's like if
there is a whole you know slow of

618
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:07,080
there is a whole you know slow of
 

619
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,120
there is a whole you know slow of
emotions it goes through but what I

620
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,130
emotions it goes through but what I
 

621
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,330
emotions it goes through but what I
remember is that when I came back to MIT

622
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:14,340
remember is that when I came back to MIT
 

623
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,300
remember is that when I came back to MIT
I was kind of going the whole times to

624
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:17,310
I was kind of going the whole times to
 

625
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,130
I was kind of going the whole times to
the treatment to MIT but was brain was

626
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:19,140
the treatment to MIT but was brain was
 

627
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,480
the treatment to MIT but was brain was
not really there but when I came back

628
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:20,490
not really there but when I came back
 

629
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,980
not really there but when I came back
here I finished went to each one that I

630
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:21,990
here I finished went to each one that I
 

631
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,920
here I finished went to each one that I
was here teaching and everything yeah I

632
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:24,930
was here teaching and everything yeah I
 

633
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,050
was here teaching and everything yeah I
look back at what my group was doing

634
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:27,060
look back at what my group was doing
 

635
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,390
look back at what my group was doing
what other groups was doing and I saw

636
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:29,400
what other groups was doing and I saw
 

637
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,550
what other groups was doing and I saw
these trivialities it's like people are

638
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:31,560
these trivialities it's like people are
 

639
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,010
these trivialities it's like people are
building their careers on improving some

640
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:34,020
building their careers on improving some
 

641
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,570
building their careers on improving some

really make a change and it was really

you know I have my graduate students

you know I have my graduate students
 

685
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,680
you know I have my graduate students
really want to do their papers and their

686
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:27,690
really want to do their papers and their
 

687
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,840
really want to do their papers and their
work and they want to continue to do

work and they want to continue to do
 

689
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,640
work and they want to continue to do
what they were doing which was great and

00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:31,650
what they were doing which was great and
 

691
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:35,200
what they were doing which was great and
then it was me who really kind of

692
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,210
then it was me who really kind of
 

693
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,580
then it was me who really kind of
reevaluated what is the importance and

694
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:37,590
reevaluated what is the importance and
 

695
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,350
reevaluated what is the importance and
also at that point because I had to take

696
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:39,360
also at that point because I had to take
 

697
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,830
also at that point because I had to take
some break I look back into like my

00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:45,840
some break I look back into like my
 

699
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,860
some break I look back into like my
years in science and I was thinking you

700
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:48,870
years in science and I was thinking you
 

701
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,080
years in science and I was thinking you
know like 10 years ago this was the

biggest thing I don't know topic models
 

705
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,590

in months I said I went to kind of to
 

801
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,879
in months I said I went to kind of to
see other people and I was like wow

802
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:55,889
see other people and I was like wow
 

803
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,019
see other people and I was like wow
first of all these people you know

804
00:16:58,019 --> 00:16:58,029
first of all these people you know
 

805
00:16:58,029 --> 00:16:59,910
first of all these people you know
they're happy and they're laughing and

806
00:16:59,910 --> 00:16:59,920
they're happy and they're laughing and
 

807
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,350
they're happy and they're laughing and
they're very different from this other

808
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:01,360
they're very different from this other
 

809
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,540
they're very different from this other
my people and second of singing I think

810
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:03,550
my people and second of singing I think
 

811
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,309
my people and second of singing I think
it totally crazy they're like laughing

812
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:05,319
it totally crazy they're like laughing
 

813
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:07,409
it totally crazy they're like laughing
and wasting their money on some stupid

814
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:07,419
and wasting their money on some stupid
 

815
00:17:07,419 --> 00:17:12,689
and wasting their money on some stupid
gifts and you know they may die they

816
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:12,699
gifts and you know they may die they
 

817
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,850
gifts and you know they may die they
already may have cancer and and they

818
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:14,860
already may have cancer and and they
 

819
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,559
already may have cancer and and they
don't understand it so you can really

820
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:16,569
don't understand it so you can really
 

821
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:20,579
don't understand it so you can really
see how the mind changes that you can

822
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:20,589
see how the mind changes that you can
 

823
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:23,039
see how the mind changes that you can
see that you know before that you can

824
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:23,049
see that you know before that you can
 

825
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:24,149
see that you know before that you can
have didn't you know that you're gonna

826
00:17:24,149 --> 00:17:24,159
have didn't you know that you're gonna
 

827
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:26,669
have didn't you know that you're gonna
die of course I knew but it was kind of

828
00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:26,679
die of course I knew but it was kind of
 

829
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:29,220
die of course I knew but it was kind of
a theoretical notion it wasn't something

830
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:29,230
a theoretical notion it wasn't something
 

831
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,799
a theoretical notion it wasn't something
which was concrete and at that point

832
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:31,809
which was concrete and at that point
 

833
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:34,649
which was concrete and at that point
when you really see it and see how

834
00:17:34,649 --> 00:17:34,659
when you really see it and see how
 

835
00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:37,890
when you really see it and see how
little means some time the system has to

836
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:37,900
little means some time the system has to
 

837
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,919

hummed and you really feel that we need

838
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:40,929
hummed and you really feel that we need
 

839
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:44,130
hummed and you really feel that we need
to take a lot of our brilliance that we

840
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:44,140
to take a lot of our brilliance that we
 

841
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,560
to take a lot of our brilliance that we
have here at MIT and translated into

842
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:46,570
have here at MIT and translated into
 

843
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,730
have here at MIT and translated into
something useful

844
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:47,740
something useful
 

845
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,860
something useful
yeah and you so couldn't have a lot of

846
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:49,870
yeah and you so couldn't have a lot of
 

847
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,720
yeah and you so couldn't have a lot of
definitions but of course alleviating

848
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:51,730
definitions but of course alleviating
 

849
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,149
definitions but of course alleviating
suffering alleviating trying to cure

850
00:17:54,149 --> 00:17:54,159
suffering alleviating trying to cure

00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:58,710
suffering alleviating trying to cure
cancer is a beautiful mission so I of

852
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:58,720
cancer is a beautiful mission so I of
 

853
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,260
cancer is a beautiful mission so I of
course know the theoretically the notion

854
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:01,270
course know the theoretically the notion
 

855
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,120
course know the theoretically the notion
of cancer but just reading more and more

856
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,130
of cancer but just reading more and more
 

857
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:07,649
of cancer but just reading more and more
about its 1.7 million new cancer cases

858
00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:07,659
about its 1.7 million new cancer cases
 

859
00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:10,010
about its 1.7 million new cancer cases
in the United States every year

860
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:10,020
in the United States every year
 

861
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,600
in the United States every year
600,000 cancer related deaths every year

862
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:12,610
600,000 cancer related deaths every year
 

863
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:16,560
600,000 cancer related deaths every year
so this has a huge impact United States

864
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:16,570
so this has a huge impact United States
 

865
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,580
so this has a huge impact United States

I do believe will happen with the
 

881
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,190
I do believe will happen with the
advancement in machine learning that a

882
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:43,200
advancement in machine learning that a
 

883
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,700
advancement in machine learning that a
lot of types of cancer we will be able

884
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:46,710
lot of types of cancer we will be able
 

885
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,200
lot of types of cancer we will be able
to predict way early

886
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,210
to predict way early
 

887
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,370
to predict way early
and more effectively utilize existing

and more effectively utilize existing
 

889
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,610

891
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,640

with all the advancements in AI and drug
 

893
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,490
with all the advancements in AI and drug
discovery we would be able to much

00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:01,500
discovery we would be able to much
 

895
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,240

00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:07,650
not sure about is how long it will take

bodies to kind of catch up and to

902
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:14,070
bodies to kind of catch up and to
 

903
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,620
bodies to kind of catch up and to
implement it and they think this is a

00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:15,630
implement it and they think this is a
 

905
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,690
implement it and they think this is a
very big piece of puzzle that is

00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:17,700
very big piece of puzzle that is
 

907
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,230

interesting question so first a small

910
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:23,370
interesting question so first a small
 

911
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,280
interesting question so first a small
detail that I think the answer is yes

912
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:25,290
detail that I think the answer is yes
 

913
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:30,680
detail that I think the answer is yes
but is cancer one of one of the diseases

914
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:30,690
but is cancer one of one of the diseases
 

915
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,890
but is cancer one of one of the diseases
that when detected earlier that

916
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:33,900
that when detected earlier that
 

917
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,700
that when detected earlier that
significantly improves the outcomes it's

918
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:37,710
significantly improves the outcomes it's
 

919
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,320
significantly improves the outcomes it's
so like because we will talk about

920
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:39,330
so like because we will talk about
 

921
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,600
so like because we will talk about
there's the cure and then there is

922
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:41,610
there's the cure and then there is
 

923
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,420
there's the cure and then there is
detection and I think while machine

924
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:44,430
detection and I think while machine
 

925
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,590
detection and I think while machine
learning can really help is earlier

926
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:45,600
learning can really help is earlier
 

927
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,080
learning can really help is earlier
detection so the detection help

928
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,090
detection so the detection help
 

929
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:51,020
detection so the detection help
prediction is crucial for instance the

930
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,030
prediction is crucial for instance the
 

931
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,870
prediction is crucial for instance the
vast majority of pancreatic cancer

932
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:52,880
vast majority of pancreatic cancer
 

933
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,790
vast majority of pancreatic cancer
patients are detected at the stage they

934
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:55,800
patients are detected at the stage they
 

935
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,730
patients are detected at the stage they
are incurable that's why they have such

936
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:58,740
are incurable that's why they have such
 

937
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:04,160
are incurable that's why they have such
a you know terrible survival rate it's

938
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,170
a you know terrible survival rate it's
 

939
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,460
a you know terrible survival rate it's
like just few percent over five years

940
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:06,470
like just few percent over five years
 

941
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:09,350
like just few percent over five years
it's pretty much today a death sentence

942
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:09,360
it's pretty much today a death sentence
 

943
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,620
it's pretty much today a death sentence
but if you can discover this disease

944
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:12,630
but if you can discover this disease
 

945
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:16,580
but if you can discover this disease
early there are mechanisms to treat it

946
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:16,590
early there are mechanisms to treat it
 

947
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,950
early there are mechanisms to treat it
and in fact I know a number of people

948
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:18,960
and in fact I know a number of people
 

949
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,680
and in fact I know a number of people
who were diagnosed and saved just

950
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:21,690
who were diagnosed and saved just
 

951
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,900
who were diagnosed and saved just
because they had food poisoning they had

952
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:23,910
because they had food poisoning they had
 

953
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,690
because they had food poisoning they had
terrible food poisoning they went to our

954
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:26,700
terrible food poisoning they went to our
 

955
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,330
terrible food poisoning they went to our
and they got scan there were early

956
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:29,340
and they got scan there were early
 

957
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,860
and they got scan there were early
science on the scan

958
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:30,870
science on the scan
 

959
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,799
science on the scan
that would save their lives but this

960
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:33,809
that would save their lives but this
 

961
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:36,169
that would save their lives but this
wasn't really an accidental case so as

962
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:36,179
wasn't really an accidental case so as
 

963
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:40,820
wasn't really an accidental case so as
we become better we would be able to

964
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:40,830
we become better we would be able to
 

965
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,570
we become better we would be able to
help too many more people that have you

966
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:44,580
help too many more people that have you
 

967
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,279
help too many more people that have you
know that are likely to develop diseases

968
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:46,289
know that are likely to develop diseases
 

969
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:49,639
know that are likely to develop diseases
and I just want to say that as I got

970
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:49,649
and I just want to say that as I got
 

971
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:51,860
and I just want to say that as I got
more into this field I realize that you

972
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:51,870
more into this field I realize that you
 

973
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,119
more into this field I realize that you
know countries of course terrible

974
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,129
know countries of course terrible
 

975
00:20:53,129 --> 00:20:55,100
know countries of course terrible
disease but they're really the whole

976
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,110
disease but they're really the whole
 

977
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:58,430
disease but they're really the whole
slew of terrible diseases out there like

978
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:58,440
slew of terrible diseases out there like
 

979
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,789
slew of terrible diseases out there like
neurodegenerative diseases and others so

980
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:01,799
neurodegenerative diseases and others so
 

981
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:04,129
neurodegenerative diseases and others so
we of course a lot of us are fixated on

982
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:04,139
we of course a lot of us are fixated on
 

983
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:05,720
we of course a lot of us are fixated on
cancer just because it's so prevalent in

984
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:05,730
cancer just because it's so prevalent in
 

985
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,609
cancer just because it's so prevalent in
our society and you see these people and

986
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:07,619
our society and you see these people and
 

987
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:08,720
our society and you see these people and
there are a lot of patients with

988
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:08,730
there are a lot of patients with
 

989
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,940
there are a lot of patients with
neurodegenerative diseases and that kind

990
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:10,950
neurodegenerative diseases and that kind
 

991
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,269
neurodegenerative diseases and that kind
of aging diseases that we still don't

992
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:14,279
of aging diseases that we still don't
 

993
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:21,019
of aging diseases that we still don't
have a good solution for and we you know

994
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:21,029
have a good solution for and we you know
 

995
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,090
have a good solution for and we you know
and I felt as a computer scientist we

996
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:23,100
and I felt as a computer scientist we
 

997
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,129
and I felt as a computer scientist we
kind of decided that it's other people's

998
00:21:25,129 --> 00:21:25,139
kind of decided that it's other people's
 

999
00:21:25,139 --> 00:21:28,519
kind of decided that it's other people's
job to treat these diseases because it's

1000
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:28,529
job to treat these diseases because it's
 

1001
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:30,409
job to treat these diseases because it's
like traditionally people in biology or

1002
00:21:30,409 --> 00:21:30,419
like traditionally people in biology or
 

1003
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,899
like traditionally people in biology or
in chemistry or and these are the ones

1004
00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:32,909
in chemistry or and these are the ones
 

1005
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:36,139
in chemistry or and these are the ones
who's thinking about it and after kind

1006
00:21:36,139 --> 00:21:36,149
who's thinking about it and after kind
 

1007
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:37,909
who's thinking about it and after kind
of start paying attention I think that

1008
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:37,919
of start paying attention I think that
 

1009
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,519
of start paying attention I think that
it's really a wrong assumption and we

1010
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:40,529
it's really a wrong assumption and we
 

1011
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:44,029
it's really a wrong assumption and we
all need to join the bottle so how it

1012
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:44,039
all need to join the bottle so how it
 

1013
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:46,639
all need to join the bottle so how it
seems like in cancer specifically that

1014
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:46,649
seems like in cancer specifically that
 

1015
00:21:46,649 --> 00:21:47,840
seems like in cancer specifically that
there's a lot of ways that machine

1016
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:47,850
there's a lot of ways that machine
 

1017
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,960
there's a lot of ways that machine
learning can help so what's what's the

1018
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:50,970
learning can help so what's what's the
 

1019
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,039
learning can help so what's what's the
role of machine learning in the

1020
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:52,049
role of machine learning in the
 

1021
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:56,359
role of machine learning in the
diagnosis of cancer so for many cancers

1022
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:56,369
diagnosis of cancer so for many cancers
 

1023
00:21:56,369 --> 00:22:00,499
diagnosis of cancer so for many cancers
today we really don't know what is your

1024
00:22:00,499 --> 00:22:00,509
today we really don't know what is your
 

1025
00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:03,080
today we really don't know what is your
likelihood to get cancer

1026
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:03,090
likelihood to get cancer
 

1027
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,750
likelihood to get cancer
and for the vast majority of patients

1028
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:05,760
and for the vast majority of patients
 

1029
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,030
and for the vast majority of patients
especially on the younger patients it

1030
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:08,040
especially on the younger patients it
 

1031
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,980
especially on the younger patients it
really comes as a surprise like for

1032
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:09,990
really comes as a surprise like for
 

1033
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,320
really comes as a surprise like for
instance for breast cancer 80% of the

1034
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:12,330
instance for breast cancer 80% of the
 

1035
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,820
instance for breast cancer 80% of the
patients are first in their families

1036
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:13,830
patients are first in their families
 

1037
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,550
patients are first in their families
it's like me and I never thought that I

1038
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:16,560
it's like me and I never thought that I
 

1039
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,580
it's like me and I never thought that I
had any increased risk because you don't

1040
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:19,590
had any increased risk because you don't
 

1041
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,290
had any increased risk because you don't
nobody had it in my family and for some

1042
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:21,300
nobody had it in my family and for some
 

1043
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,170
nobody had it in my family and for some
reason in my head it was kind of

1044
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:23,180
reason in my head it was kind of
 

1045
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:26,030
reason in my head it was kind of
inherited disease

1046
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:26,040
inherited disease
 

1047
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,549
inherited disease
but even if I would pay attention the

1048
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:28,559
but even if I would pay attention the
 

1049
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,740
but even if I would pay attention the
the models that currently this is very

1050
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:30,750
the models that currently this is very
 

1051
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,600
the models that currently this is very
simplistic statistical models that are

1052
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:32,610
simplistic statistical models that are
 

1053
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,130
simplistic statistical models that are
currently used that in clinical practice

1054
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:34,140
currently used that in clinical practice
 

1055
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,900
currently used that in clinical practice
it really don't give you an answer so

1056
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:35,910
it really don't give you an answer so
 

1057
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:39,680
it really don't give you an answer so
you don't know and the same pancreatic

1058
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:39,690
you don't know and the same pancreatic
 

1059
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,590
you don't know and the same pancreatic
cancer the same truth for non-smoking

1060
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:42,600
cancer the same truth for non-smoking
 

1061
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,140
cancer the same truth for non-smoking
one cancer and many others

1062
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:45,150
one cancer and many others
 

1063
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:47,390
one cancer and many others
so what machine learning can do here is

1064
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:47,400
so what machine learning can do here is
 

1065
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,830
so what machine learning can do here is
utilize all this data to tell us le who

1066
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:51,840
utilize all this data to tell us le who
 

1067
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,049
utilize all this data to tell us le who
is like it'll be susceptible and using

1068
00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:54,059
is like it'll be susceptible and using
 

1069
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:55,549
is like it'll be susceptible and using
all the information that is already

1070
00:22:55,549 --> 00:22:55,559
all the information that is already
 

1071
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:59,780
all the information that is already
there beat imaging beat your other tests

1072
00:22:59,780 --> 00:22:59,790
there beat imaging beat your other tests
 

1073
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:03,530
there beat imaging beat your other tests
and you know eventually liquid biopsies

1074
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:03,540
and you know eventually liquid biopsies
 

1075
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,740
and you know eventually liquid biopsies
and others where the signal itself is

1076
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:06,750
and others where the signal itself is
 

1077
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,020

00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,030
not sufficiently strong for human eye to
 

1079
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,750
not sufficiently strong for human eye to
do good discrimination because the

00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:11,760
do good discrimination because the
 

1081
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,210
do good discrimination because the
signal may be weak but by combining many

1082
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:14,220
signal may be weak but by combining many
 

1083

large volumes of data can really detect

1086
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:20,190
large volumes of data can really detect
 

1087
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,680
large volumes of data can really detect
it early and that what we've seen with

1088
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:21,690
it early and that what we've seen with
 

1089
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,570
it early and that what we've seen with
breast cancer and people are reporting

1090
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:23,580
breast cancer and people are reporting
 

1091
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,240
breast cancer and people are reporting
it in other diseases as well that really

1092
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:26,250
it in other diseases as well that really
 

1093
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,760
it in other diseases as well that really
boils down to data right and in the

1094
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:28,770
boils down to data right and in the
 

1095
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,409
boils down to data right and in the
different kinds of sources of data and

1096
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:30,419
different kinds of sources of data and
 

1097
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:33,799
different kinds of sources of data and
you mentioned regulatory challenges so

1098
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:33,809
you mentioned regulatory challenges so
 

1099
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:36,130
you mentioned regulatory challenges so
what are the challenges in gathering

1100
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:36,140
what are the challenges in gathering
 

1101
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:41,299
what are the challenges in gathering
large data sets in the space again

1102
00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:41,309
large data sets in the space again
 

1103
00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:43,430
large data sets in the space again
another great question so it took me

1104
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:43,440
another great question so it took me
 

1105
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,289
another great question so it took me
after I decided that I want to work on

1106
00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:45,299
after I decided that I want to work on
 

1107
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:50,530
after I decided that I want to work on
it two years to get access to data and

1108
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:50,540

 

1109
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,780

like right now in this country there is

1110
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:53,790
like right now in this country there is
 

1111
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:57,470
like right now in this country there is
no publicly available data set of modern

1112
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:57,480
no publicly available data set of modern
 

1113
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,000
no publicly available data set of modern
mammograms that you can just go on your

computer sign a document and get it it

1116
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:01,919

really love to get it you know from
 

1241
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,930
really love to get it you know from
other people because other people think

other people because other people think
 

1243
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,149
other people because other people think
in the same way so if there is a

1244
00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:42,159
in the same way so if there is a
 

1245
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,169
in the same way so if there is a
mechanism to do this the nation and and

1246
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:46,179
mechanism to do this the nation and and
 

1247
00:26:46,179 --> 00:26:48,240
mechanism to do this the nation and and

alleviate those concerns is that seems

1272
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:17,620
alleviate those concerns is that seems
 

1273
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,620
alleviate those concerns is that seems
like a problem that needs to be that

1274

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:23,049
encoded images and then you send the
 

1321
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:25,500
encoded images and then you send the
outcome back to the hospital and you can

outcome back to the hospital and you can
 

1323
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,659

00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,610
to give this data away on one hand and
then it is general concern now when I'm

when I really needed an answer I had to
 

1371
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:34,080
when I really needed an answer I had to
make a choice there was no information

1372
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,090
make a choice there was no information
 

1373
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,820
make a choice there was no information
to make a choice you're just guessing

1374
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:35,830
to make a choice you're just guessing
 

1375
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:39,510
to make a choice you're just guessing
and at that moment you feel that your

1376
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:39,520
and at that moment you feel that your
 

1377
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,730
and at that moment you feel that your
life is at the stake but you just don't

1378
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:41,740
life is at the stake but you just don't
 

1379

life is at the stake but you just don't
have information to make the choice and

that people ask to run because they need

1396
00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:06,779
that people ask to run because they need
 

1397

to make you know life-changing decisions
 

1399
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:11,690
to make you know life-changing decisions
and of course you know I'm not planning

1400
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:11,700
and of course you know I'm not planning
 

1401
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,899
and of course you know I'm not planning
to open a clinic here but we do run and

1402
00:30:14,899 --> 00:30:14,909
to open a clinic here but we do run and
 

1403
00:30:14,909 --> 00:30:16,460
to open a clinic here but we do run and
give them the results for their doctors

1404
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:16,470
give them the results for their doctors
 

1405
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:19,490
give them the results for their doctors
but the point that I'm trying to make

1406
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:19,500
but the point that I'm trying to make
 

1407
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,180
but the point that I'm trying to make
that we all at some point or our loved

1408
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:23,190
that we all at some point or our loved
 

1409
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,519
that we all at some point or our loved
ones will be in the situation where you

1410
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:25,529
ones will be in the situation where you
 

1411
00:30:25,529 --> 00:30:27,710
ones will be in the situation where you
need information to make the best choice

1412
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:27,720
need information to make the best choice
 

1413
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,120
need information to make the best choice
and if this information is not available

1414
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,130
and if this information is not available
 

1415
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,680
and if this information is not available
you would feel vulnerable and

1416
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:33,690
you would feel vulnerable and
 

1417
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:36,740
you would feel vulnerable and
unprotected and then the question is you

1418
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:36,750
unprotected and then the question is you
 

1419
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,299
unprotected and then the question is you
know what do I care more because at the

1420
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:38,309
know what do I care more because at the
 

1421
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:40,009
know what do I care more because at the

one possible solution I'd like to see

1428
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:46,230
one possible solution I'd like to see
 

1429
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,850
one possible solution I'd like to see
what you think of it

1430
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:48,860
what you think of it
 

1431
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,960
what you think of it
based on what you just said based on

1432
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:50,970
based on what you just said based on
 

1433
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:53,450
based on what you just said based on
wanting to know answers for anyone urine

1434
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:53,460
wanting to know answers for anyone urine
 

1435
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,280
wanting to know answers for anyone urine
yourself in that situation is it

1436
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:55,290
yourself in that situation is it
 

1437
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:57,440
yourself in that situation is it
possible for patients to own their data

1438
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:57,450
possible for patients to own their data
 

1439
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:00,020
possible for patients to own their data
as opposed to hospitals owning their

1440
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,030
as opposed to hospitals owning their
 

1441
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,540
as opposed to hospitals owning their
data of course theoretically I guess

1442
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:02,550
data of course theoretically I guess
 

1443
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,760
data of course theoretically I guess
patients own their data but can you walk

1444
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:04,770
patients own their data but can you walk
 

1445
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:08,060
patients own their data but can you walk

00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:06,690
CDC you can imagine we're looking at the
 

1497
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:07,940
CDC you can imagine we're looking at the
kind of decades-old

1498
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:07,950
kind of decades-old

mechanism of data exchange
 

1501
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,430
mechanism of data exchange
so I definitely think this is in the

1502
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:13,440
so I definitely think this is in the
 

1503
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,080
so I definitely think this is in the
area where hopefully all the right

1504
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:17,090
area where hopefully all the right
 

1505
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:19,850
area where hopefully all the right

regulatory and technical forces will
 

1507
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,100
regulatory and technical forces will
align and we will see it actually

1508
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:22,110
align and we will see it actually
 

1509
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,730
align and we will see it actually
implemented it's sad because

unfortunately and I have I need to
 

1513
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:29,060
unfortunately and I have I need to
research why that happened but I'm

1514
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:29,070
research why that happened but I'm
 

1515
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,740
research why that happened but I'm
pretty sure Google Health and

1516
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:30,750
pretty sure Google Health and
 

1517
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,570
pretty sure Google Health and

1519
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,510
Microsoft's HealthVault or whatever it's
called both closed down which means that

1520
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:35,520
called both closed down which means that
 

1521
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,700
called both closed down which means that
there was either regulatory pressure or

1522
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:37,710
there was either regulatory pressure or
 

1523
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,950
there was either regulatory pressure or
there's not a business case or there's

there's not a business case or there's
 

1525
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,170
there's not a business case or there's
challenges from hospitals which is very

1526
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:42,180
challenges from hospitals which is very
 

1527
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,360
challenges from hospitals which is very
disappointing so when you say you don't

1528
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:44,370
disappointing so when you say you don't
 

1529
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:46,760
disappointing so when you say you don't
know what the biggest players are the

1530
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:46,770
know what the biggest players are the
 

1531
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:49,460
know what the biggest players are the
two biggest that I was aware of close

1532
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:49,470
two biggest that I was aware of close
 

1533
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,550
two biggest that I was aware of close
the doors so I'm hoping uh I'd love to

1534
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:52,560
the doors so I'm hoping uh I'd love to
 

1535
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,290
the doors so I'm hoping uh I'd love to
see why and I'd love to see who else can

1536
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:54,300
see why and I'd love to see who else can
 

1537
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:58,370
see why and I'd love to see who else can
come up it seems like one of those Elon

Musk style problems that are obvious

1540
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:00,240
Musk style problems that are obvious
 

1541
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,850
Musk style problems that are obvious
needs to be solved and somebody needs to

1542
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:01,860
needs to be solved and somebody needs to
 

1543
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,590
needs to be solved and somebody needs to
step up and actually do this large-scale

1544
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:03,600
step up and actually do this large-scale
 

1545
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,390
step up and actually do this large-scale
data collection I know that is an

1546
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:08,400
data collection I know that is an
 

1547
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,890
data collection I know that is an
initiative in Massachusetts the thing

1548
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:09,900
initiative in Massachusetts the thing
 

1549
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,350
initiative in Massachusetts the thing
that you led by the governor to try to

1550
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:12,360
that you led by the governor to try to
 

1551
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,840
that you led by the governor to try to
create this kind of house exchange

1552
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:14,850
create this kind of house exchange
 

1553
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:16,850
create this kind of house exchange
system or at least to help people who

1554
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:16,860
system or at least to help people who
 

1555
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,410

kind of when you show up in emergency

1556
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:18,420
kind of when you show up in emergency
 

1557
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,270
kind of when you show up in emergency
room and there is no information about

1558
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:20,280
room and there is no information about
 

1559
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,690
room and there is no information about
what our ologists and other things so I

1560
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:23,700
what our ologists and other things so I
 

1561
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,910
what our ologists and other things so I
drove how far it will go

1562
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:25,920
drove how far it will go
 

1563
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,640
drove how far it will go
but another thing is you said and I find

1564
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:28,650
but another thing is you said and I find
 

1565
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:30,950
but another thing is you said and I find
it very interesting it's actually who

1566
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:30,960
it very interesting it's actually who
 

1567
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,050
it very interesting it's actually who
are the successful players in this space

1568
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:33,060
are the successful players in this space
 

1569
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:36,860
are the successful players in this space
and the whole implementation how does it

1570
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:36,870
and the whole implementation how does it
 

1571
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:39,650
and the whole implementation how does it
go two meters from the anthropological

1572
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:39,660
go two meters from the anthropological
 

1573
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,960
go two meters from the anthropological
perspective it's more fascinating that

1574
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:41,970
perspective it's more fascinating that
 

1575
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:44,210
perspective it's more fascinating that
AI that today goes in healthcare you

1576
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:44,220
AI that today goes in healthcare you
 

1577
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,150
AI that today goes in healthcare you
know we've seen so many you know

1578
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:47,160
know we've seen so many you know
 

1579
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,370
know we've seen so many you know
attempts and so very little successes

1580
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:49,380
attempts and so very little successes
 

1581
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,190
attempts and so very little successes
and it's interesting to understand that

1582
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:52,200
and it's interesting to understand that
 

1583
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,770
and it's interesting to understand that
I've by no means you know have knowledge

1584
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:54,780
I've by no means you know have knowledge
 

1585
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:58,250
I've by no means you know have knowledge
to assess why we are in the position

1586
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:58,260
to assess why we are in the position
 

1587
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,500
to assess why we are in the position
where we are yeah it's interesting as a

1588
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:00,510
where we are yeah it's interesting as a
 

1589
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:03,500
where we are yeah it's interesting as a
data is really fuel for a lot of

1590
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:03,510
data is really fuel for a lot of
 

1591
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,420
data is really fuel for a lot of
successful applications and when that

1592
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:05,430
successful applications and when that
 

1593
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:08,629
successful applications and when that
data requires regulatory approval like

1594
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:08,639
data requires regulatory approval like
 

1595
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,450
data requires regulatory approval like
the FDA or any kind of approval it's

1596
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:13,460
the FDA or any kind of approval it's
 

1597
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,800
the FDA or any kind of approval it's
seems that the computer scientists are

1598
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:15,810
seems that the computer scientists are
 

1599
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,510
seems that the computer scientists are
not quite there yet in being able to

1600
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:17,520
not quite there yet in being able to
 

1601
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,490
not quite there yet in being able to
play the regular game understanding the

1602
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:19,500
play the regular game understanding the
 

1603
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,820
play the regular game understanding the
fundamentals of it I think that in many

1604
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:22,830
fundamentals of it I think that in many
 

1605
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:25,190
fundamentals of it I think that in many
cases when even people

1606
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:25,200
cases when even people
 

1607
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,559

do you have data we still don't know

1608
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:27,569
do you have data we still don't know
 

1609
00:34:27,569 --> 00:34:30,470
do you have data we still don't know
what exactly do you need to demonstrate

1610
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:30,480
what exactly do you need to demonstrate
 

1611
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,690
what exactly do you need to demonstrate
to change the standard of care well like

1612
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:35,700
to change the standard of care well like
 

1613
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,260
to change the standard of care well like
let me give you example related to my

assessment there is something called

1620
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:46,230
assessment there is something called
 

1621
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,859
assessment there is something called
density which determines the likelihood

1622
00:34:48,859 --> 00:34:48,869
density which determines the likelihood
 

1623
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:51,020
density which determines the likelihood
of a woman to get cancer and this is

1624
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,030
of a woman to get cancer and this is
 

1625
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:53,059

pretty much this how much white do you

1626
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:53,069
pretty much this how much white do you
 

1627
00:34:53,069 --> 00:34:55,039
pretty much this how much white do you
see on the mammogram the white say it is

1628
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:55,049
see on the mammogram the white say it is
 

1629
00:34:55,049 --> 00:34:57,799
see on the mammogram the white say it is
and the more likely the tissue is dense

1630
00:34:57,799 --> 00:34:57,809
and the more likely the tissue is dense
 

1631
00:34:57,809 --> 00:35:03,049
and the more likely the tissue is dense
and the idea behind density it's not a

wolf decided to look back at women who
 

1637
00:35:08,549 --> 00:35:11,390
wolf decided to look back at women who
were diagnosed and see what is special

00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:11,400
were diagnosed and see what is special
 

1639
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,609
were diagnosed and see what is special
in the images can we look back and says

1640
00:35:13,609 --> 00:35:13,619
in the images can we look back and says
 

1641
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:14,960
in the images can we look back and says
that they're likely to develop so he

come up with some patters it was the
 

1645
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,880
come up with some patters it was the
best that his human I can you know can

00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:21,960
identify then it was kind of formalized
 

1649
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,500
identify then it was kind of formalized
and coded into four categories and that

1650
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:24,510
and coded into four categories and that
 

1651
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:29,839
and coded into four categories and that
what we are using today and today this

be advised by their providers if they
have high density putting them into

have high density putting them into
 

1665
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,370
have high density putting them into
high-risk category and in some states

1666
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:49,380
high-risk category and in some states
 

1667
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,839
high-risk category and in some states
you can actually get supplementary

1668
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:50,849
you can actually get supplementary
 

1669
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:52,760
you can actually get supplementary
screening paid by your insurance because

1670
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:52,770
screening paid by your insurance because
 

1671
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:54,349
screening paid by your insurance because
you are in this category now you can say

1672
00:35:54,349 --> 00:35:54,359
you are in this category now you can say
 

1673
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:56,720
you are in this category now you can say
how much science do we have behind it

1674
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:56,730
how much science do we have behind it
 

1675
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,720
how much science do we have behind it
whatever biological science or

1676
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:58,730
whatever biological science or
 

1677
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:01,609
whatever biological science or
epidemiological evidence so it turns out

1678
00:36:01,609 --> 00:36:01,619
epidemiological evidence so it turns out
 

1679
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:04,670
epidemiological evidence so it turns out
that between 40 and 50 percent of women

1680
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:04,680
that between 40 and 50 percent of women
 

1681
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,000
that between 40 and 50 percent of women
have dense breasts so about 40 percent

1682
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,010
have dense breasts so about 40 percent
 

1683
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:10,339
have dense breasts so about 40 percent
of patients are coming out of their

1684
00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:10,349
of patients are coming out of their
 

1685
00:36:10,349 --> 00:36:13,549
of patients are coming out of their
screening and somebody tells them you

1686
00:36:13,549 --> 00:36:13,559
screening and somebody tells them you
 

1687
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:16,250
screening and somebody tells them you
are in high risk now what exactly does

1688
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:16,260
are in high risk now what exactly does
 

1689
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,530
are in high risk now what exactly does
it mean if you as half of the population

1690
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:18,540
it mean if you as half of the population
 

1691
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,770
it mean if you as half of the population
high risk its recede maybe I'm not you

1692
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:21,780
high risk its recede maybe I'm not you
 

1693
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,660
high risk its recede maybe I'm not you
know what do I really need to do with it

1694
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:23,670
know what do I really need to do with it
 

1695
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:27,260
know what do I really need to do with it
because the system doesn't provide me a

1696
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:27,270
because the system doesn't provide me a
 

1697
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,730
because the system doesn't provide me a
lot of the solutions because there are

1698
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:28,740
lot of the solutions because there are
 

1699
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,859
lot of the solutions because there are
so many people like me we cannot really

1700
00:36:30,859 --> 00:36:30,869
so many people like me we cannot really
 

1701
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:33,530
so many people like me we cannot really
provide very expensive solutions for

1702
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:33,540
provide very expensive solutions for
 

1703
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,460
provide very expensive solutions for
them

1704
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:34,470
them
 

1705
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:37,099
them
and the reason this whole density became

1706
00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:37,109
and the reason this whole density became
 

1707
00:36:37,109 --> 00:36:40,130
and the reason this whole density became
this big deal it's actually advocated by

1708
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:40,140
this big deal it's actually advocated by
 

1709
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,440
this big deal it's actually advocated by
the patients who felt very unprotected

1710
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:42,450
the patients who felt very unprotected
 

1711
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,270
the patients who felt very unprotected
because many women when did the

1712
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:44,280
because many women when did the
 

1713
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,150
because many women when did the
mammograms which were normal and then it

1714
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:47,160
mammograms which were normal and then it
 

1715
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,700
mammograms which were normal and then it
turns out that they already had cancer

1716
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:48,710
turns out that they already had cancer
 

1717
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:51,230
turns out that they already had cancer
quite developed cancer so they didn't

1718
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:51,240
quite developed cancer so they didn't
 

1719
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,170
quite developed cancer so they didn't
have a way to know who is really at risk

1720
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:54,180
have a way to know who is really at risk
 

1721
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,760
have a way to know who is really at risk
and what is the likelihood it when the

1722
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:55,770
and what is the likelihood it when the
 

1723
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,140
and what is the likelihood it when the
doctor tells you you're okay you are not

1724
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:57,150
doctor tells you you're okay you are not
 

1725
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:00,680
doctor tells you you're okay you are not
okay well at the time and it was you

1726
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:00,690
okay well at the time and it was you
 

1727
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,930
okay well at the time and it was you
know 15 years ago this maybe was the

1728
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:02,940
know 15 years ago this maybe was the
 

1729
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:07,400
know 15 years ago this maybe was the
best piece of science that we had and it

1730
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:07,410
best piece of science that we had and it
 

1731
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:11,330
best piece of science that we had and it
took you know quite 1516 years to make

1732
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:11,340
took you know quite 1516 years to make
 

1733
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:14,420
took you know quite 1516 years to make
it federal law but now that this is this

1734
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:14,430
it federal law but now that this is this
 

1735
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:17,240
it federal law but now that this is this
is a standard now within the planning

1736
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:17,250
is a standard now within the planning
 

1737
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,040
is a standard now within the planning

to convince how many hospitals do you
 

1781
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:08,599
to convince how many hospitals do you
need to run the experiment both you know

1786
00:38:16,579 --> 00:38:16,589
do you explain to patients and to women

1789
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,410

00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:29,089
make the algorithm even better but I

00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:31,089
successful if we push on this group of
people is that the doctors is it the

simple answer but I think there is a lot
 

1859
00:39:49,339 --> 00:39:52,269
simple answer but I think there is a lot
of good people in medical system who do

of good people in medical system who do

and I think a lot of power will come
 

1865
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:02,059
and I think a lot of power will come
from us as a consumers because we all

1866
00:40:02,059 --> 00:40:02,069
from us as a consumers because we all
 

1867
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:04,370
from us as a consumers because we all
are consumers or future consumers of

are consumers or future consumers of

00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:10,130
are consumers or future consumers of
healthcare services and I think we can

1870

healthcare services and I think we can
 

1871
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:13,279
healthcare services and I think we can
do so much more in explaining the

1872
00:40:13,279 --> 00:40:13,289
do so much more in explaining the
 

1873
00:40:13,289 --> 00:40:15,620
do so much more in explaining the
potential and not in the hype terms and

not saying that we now killed all
 

1877
00:40:17,069 --> 00:40:18,949
not saying that we now killed all

eventually you know we all are humans

1896
00:40:40,969 --> 00:40:40,979
eventually you know we all are humans
 

1897
00:40:40,979 --> 00:40:43,069
eventually you know we all are humans
and we're looking for way to alleviate

1898
00:40:43,069 --> 00:40:43,079
and we're looking for way to alleviate
 

1899
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:46,130
and we're looking for way to alleviate
the suffering and and this is one

1900
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:46,140
the suffering and and this is one
 

1901
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,319
the suffering and and this is one
possible way where we can't the

1902
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:48,329
possible way where we can't the
 

1903
00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:51,979
possible way where we can't the

1904
00:40:51,979 --> 00:40:51,989
underutilizing which i think can help so
 

1905
00:40:51,989 --> 00:40:53,989
underutilizing which i think can help so
it sounds like the biggest problems are

1906
00:40:53,989 --> 00:40:53,999
it sounds like the biggest problems are
 

1907
00:40:53,999 --> 00:40:56,329
it sounds like the biggest problems are
outside of AI in terms of the biggest

1908
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:56,339
outside of AI in terms of the biggest
 

1909
00:40:56,339 --> 00:40:58,759
outside of AI in terms of the biggest
impact at this point but are there any

1910
00:40:58,759 --> 00:40:58,769
impact at this point but are there any
 

1911
00:40:58,769 --> 00:41:01,699
impact at this point but are there any
open problems in the application of ml

00:41:01,699 --> 00:41:01,709
open problems in the application of ml
 

1913

beside detection another area what I am

1930
00:41:23,509 --> 00:41:23,519
beside detection another area what I am
 

1931
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:25,789
beside detection another area what I am
kind of quite active and I think it's

1932
00:41:25,789 --> 00:41:25,799
kind of quite active and I think it's
 

1933
00:41:25,799 --> 00:41:28,579
kind of quite active and I think it's
really an increasingly important area in

1934
00:41:28,579 --> 00:41:28,589
really an increasingly important area in
 

1935
00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:32,260
really an increasingly important area in
house care is drug design

1936
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:32,270
house care is drug design
 

1937
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:36,050
house care is drug design
because you know it's fine if you detect

1938
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:36,060
because you know it's fine if you detect
 

1939
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,570
because you know it's fine if you detect
something early but you still need to

1940
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:38,580
something early but you still need to
 

1941
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:42,560
something early but you still need to
get you know to get drugs and new drugs

1942

get you know to get drugs and new drugs
 

1943
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:45,860
get you know to get drugs and new drugs
for these conditions and today all of

00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:45,870
for these conditions and today all of
 

1945
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,140
for these conditions and today all of
the drug design ml is non-existent that

the drug design ml is non-existent that
 

1947
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:50,360
the drug design ml is non-existent that
we don't have any drug that was

00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:50,370
we don't have any drug that was
 

1949
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:53,690
we don't have any drug that was
developed by their male model or even

think this area was all the new ability

1956
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:03,270
think this area was all the new ability
 

1957
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,090
think this area was all the new ability
to generate molecules with desired

properties to do in silica screening is
 

1961
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:11,960
properties to do in silica screening is
really a big open area in to be totally

areas and you applying them with some

1970
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:19,320
areas and you applying them with some
 

1971
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:24,290
areas and you applying them with some
adaptation the area of you know drug

1972
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:24,300
adaptation the area of you know drug
 

1973
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,750
adaptation the area of you know drug
design is very technically interesting

1974
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:26,760
design is very technically interesting
 

1975
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,150
design is very technically interesting
and exciting area you need to work a lot

1976
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:29,160
and exciting area you need to work a lot
 

1977
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:34,070
and exciting area you need to work a lot
with graphs and capture various 3d

1978
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:34,080
with graphs and capture various 3d
 

1979
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,720
with graphs and capture various 3d
properties there are lots and lots of

1980
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:35,730
properties there are lots and lots of
 

1981
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:38,960
properties there are lots and lots of
opportunities to be technically creative

1982

opportunities to be technically creative
 

1983
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:43,910
opportunities to be technically creative
and I think there are a lot of open

1984
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:43,920
and I think there are a lot of open
 

1985
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,940
and I think there are a lot of open
questions in this area you know we're

1986
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:46,950
questions in this area you know we're
 

1987
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:48,860
questions in this area you know we're
already getting a lot of successes even

1988
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:48,870
already getting a lot of successes even
 

1989
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:50,630
already getting a lot of successes even
you know with the kind of the first

1990
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:50,640
you know with the kind of the first
 

1991
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,090
you know with the kind of the first
generation of this models but there is

1992
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:53,100
generation of this models but there is
 

1993
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,940
generation of this models but there is
much more new creative things that you

1994
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:55,950
much more new creative things that you
 

1995
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:58,790
much more new creative things that you
can do and what's very nice to see is it

1996
00:42:58,790 --> 00:42:58,800
can do and what's very nice to see is it
 

1997
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,590
can do and what's very nice to see is it
actually the you know the the more

1998
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:00,600
actually the you know the the more
 

1999
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,760
actually the you know the the more
powerful

powerful
 

2001
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:04,620
powerful
the more interesting models actually do

2002
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:04,630
the more interesting models actually do
 

2003
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:09,180
the more interesting models actually do
do better so there is a place to to

2004
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:09,190
do better so there is a place to to
 

2005
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:11,609
do better so there is a place to to
innovate in machine learning in this

2006
00:43:11,609 --> 00:43:11,619
innovate in machine learning in this
 

2007
00:43:11,619 --> 00:43:15,750
innovate in machine learning in this
area and some of these techniques are

2008
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:15,760
area and some of these techniques are
 

2009
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,760
area and some of these techniques are
really unique to let's say to you know

2010
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:17,770
really unique to let's say to you know
 

2011
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:20,210
really unique to let's say to you know
graph generation and other things so

2012
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:20,220
graph generation and other things so
 

2013
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:23,240
graph generation and other things so
what just an interpreter quick I'm sorry

2014
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:23,250
what just an interpreter quick I'm sorry
 

2015

graph generation or graphs drug
 

2017
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:30,810

discovery in general what's what how do

2018
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:30,820
discovery in general what's what how do
 

2019
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:33,390
discovery in general what's what how do
you discover a drug is this chemistry is

2020
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:33,400
you discover a drug is this chemistry is
 

2021
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,579
you discover a drug is this chemistry is
this trying to predict different

2022
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:35,589
this trying to predict different
 

2023
00:43:35,589 --> 00:43:39,089
this trying to predict different
chemical reactions or is it some kind of

2024
00:43:39,089 --> 00:43:39,099
chemical reactions or is it some kind of
 

2025
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:41,460
chemical reactions or is it some kind of
water graphs even represented in this

2026
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:41,470
water graphs even represented in this
 

2027
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:46,290
water graphs even represented in this
paper and what's a drug okay so let's

2028
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:46,300
paper and what's a drug okay so let's
 

2029
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,790
paper and what's a drug okay so let's
say you think there are many different

2030
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:47,800
say you think there are many different
 

2031
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,050
say you think there are many different
types of drugs but let's say you're

2032
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:49,060
types of drugs but let's say you're
 

2033
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,700
types of drugs but let's say you're
gonna talk about small molecules because

2034
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:50,710
gonna talk about small molecules because
 

2035
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,920
gonna talk about small molecules because
I think today the majority of drugs are

2036
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:52,930
I think today the majority of drugs are
 

2037
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,510
I think today the majority of drugs are
small molecules so small molecule is a

2038
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:54,520
small molecules so small molecule is a
 

2039
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,030
small molecules so small molecule is a
graph the molecule is just where the

2040
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:57,040
graph the molecule is just where the
 

2041
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,329
graph the molecule is just where the
node in the graph is an atom and then

2042
00:44:00,329 --> 00:44:00,339
node in the graph is an atom and then
 

2043
00:44:00,339 --> 00:44:02,460
node in the graph is an atom and then
you have the bone so it's really a graph

2044
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:02,470
you have the bone so it's really a graph
 

2045
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:04,200
you have the bone so it's really a graph
representation if you look at it in 2d

2046
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:04,210
representation if you look at it in 2d
 

2047
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:05,070
representation if you look at it in 2d
correct

2048
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:05,080
correct
 

2049
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,260
correct
you can do it 3d but let's say well

2050
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:07,270
you can do it 3d but let's say well
 

2051
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:11,730
you can do it 3d but let's say well
let's keep it simple and stick in 2d so

2052
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:11,740
let's keep it simple and stick in 2d so
 

2053
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:14,910
let's keep it simple and stick in 2d so
pretty much my understanding today how

2054
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:14,920
pretty much my understanding today how
 

2055
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,280
pretty much my understanding today how
it is done a scale in the companies

2056
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:17,290
it is done a scale in the companies
 

2057
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:20,280
it is done a scale in the companies
you're without machine learning you have

2058
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:20,290
you're without machine learning you have
 

2059
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,589
you're without machine learning you have
high throughput screening so you know

2060
00:44:22,589 --> 00:44:22,599
high throughput screening so you know
 

2061
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:24,329
high throughput screening so you know
that you are interested to get certain

2062
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:24,339
that you are interested to get certain
 

2063
00:44:24,339 --> 00:44:26,700
that you are interested to get certain
biological activity over the compound so

2064
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:26,710
biological activity over the compound so
 

2065
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:29,550
biological activity over the compound so
you scan a lot of compounds like maybe

2066
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:29,560
you scan a lot of compounds like maybe
 

2067
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,500
you scan a lot of compounds like maybe
hundreds of thousands some really big

2068
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:31,510
hundreds of thousands some really big
 

2069
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:34,140
hundreds of thousands some really big
number of compounds you identify some

2070
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:34,150
number of compounds you identify some
 

2071
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:35,880
number of compounds you identify some
compounds which have the right activity

2072
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:35,890
compounds which have the right activity
 

2073
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,920
compounds which have the right activity
and then at this point you know the

2074
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:37,930
and then at this point you know the
 

2075
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:42,060
and then at this point you know the
chemists come and they're trying to now

2076
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:42,070
chemists come and they're trying to now
 

2077
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:44,400
chemists come and they're trying to now
to optimize this original heat to

2078
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:44,410
to optimize this original heat to
 

2079
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:46,109
to optimize this original heat to
different properties that you want it to

2080
00:44:46,109 --> 00:44:46,119
different properties that you want it to
 

2081
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:48,000
different properties that you want it to
be maybe soluble you want to decrease

2082
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,010
be maybe soluble you want to decrease
 

2083
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:50,400
be maybe soluble you want to decrease
tax ECG you want to decrease the side

2084
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:50,410
tax ECG you want to decrease the side
 

2085
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:54,359
tax ECG you want to decrease the side
effects against your dropper can that be

2086
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:54,369
effects against your dropper can that be
 

2087
00:44:54,369 --> 00:44:56,460
effects against your dropper can that be
done in simulation or just by looking at

2088
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:56,470
done in simulation or just by looking at
 

2089
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:58,589
done in simulation or just by looking at
the molecules or do you need to actually

2090
00:44:58,589 --> 00:44:58,599
the molecules or do you need to actually
 

2091
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:02,130
the molecules or do you need to actually
run reactions and real labs with lab it

2092
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:02,140
run reactions and real labs with lab it
 

2093
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,510
run reactions and real labs with lab it
is so when you do high throughput

2094
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:03,520
is so when you do high throughput
 

2095
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,210
is so when you do high throughput
screening you really do screening it's

2096
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:06,220
screening you really do screening it's
 

2097
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:08,579
screening you really do screening it's
in the lab it's it's really the lab

2098
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:08,589
in the lab it's it's really the lab
 

2099
00:45:08,589 --> 00:45:10,290
in the lab it's it's really the lab
screening you screen the molecules

2100
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:10,300
screening you screen the molecules
 

2101
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:13,740
screening you screen the molecules
corrected screening you just check them

2102
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:13,750
corrected screening you just check them
 

2103
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:15,570
corrected screening you just check them
for certain property like in the

2104
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:15,580
for certain property like in the
 

2105
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:16,080
for certain property like in the
physical

2106
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:16,090
physical
 

2107
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,430
physical
space in the physical world like

2108
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:17,440
space in the physical world like
 

2109
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,600
space in the physical world like
actually there's a machine probably

2110
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:18,610
actually there's a machine probably
 

2111
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:20,850
actually there's a machine probably
that's doing some actually running the

2112
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:20,860
that's doing some actually running the
 

2113
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:23,310
that's doing some actually running the
race actually running reactions yeah so

2114
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:23,320
race actually running reactions yeah so
 

2115
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,290
race actually running reactions yeah so
so there is a process where you can run

2116
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:25,300
so there is a process where you can run
 

2117
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,940
so there is a process where you can run
in this race go high through bodily you

2118
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:26,950
in this race go high through bodily you
 

2119
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:29,850
in this race go high through bodily you
know it become cheaper and faster to do

2120
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:29,860
know it become cheaper and faster to do
 

2121
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:33,990
know it become cheaper and faster to do
it and very big number of molecules you

2122
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:34,000
it and very big number of molecules you
 

2123
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,490
it and very big number of molecules you
run the screaming you identify potential

2124
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:37,500
run the screaming you identify potential
 

2125
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,620
run the screaming you identify potential
you know potential good starts and then

2126
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:40,630
you know potential good starts and then
 

2127
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:42,960
you know potential good starts and then
we're the chemists come in who you know

2128
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:42,970
we're the chemists come in who you know
 

2129
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:44,460
we're the chemists come in who you know
I've done it many times and then they

2130
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:44,470
I've done it many times and then they
 

2131
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:46,650
I've done it many times and then they
can try to look at it and say how can I

2132
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:46,660
can try to look at it and say how can I
 

2133
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:50,570
can try to look at it and say how can I
change the Millennial to get the desired

2134
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:50,580
change the Millennial to get the desired
 

2135
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,430
change the Millennial to get the desired
profile in terms of all other properties

2136
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:53,440
profile in terms of all other properties
 

2137
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,930
profile in terms of all other properties
so maybe how do you make it more by

2138
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:54,940
so maybe how do you make it more by
 

2139
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:57,750
so maybe how do you make it more by
octave and so on and they're you know

2140
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:57,760
octave and so on and they're you know
 

2141
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,320
octave and so on and they're you know
the creativity of the chemist really is

2142
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:01,330
the creativity of the chemist really is
 

2143
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:03,780
the creativity of the chemist really is
the one the determines the success of

2144
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:03,790
the one the determines the success of
 

2145
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:07,740
the one the determines the success of
this design because again they have a

2146
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:07,750
this design because again they have a
 

2147
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:10,350
this design because again they have a
lot of domain knowledge you know what

2148
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:10,360
lot of domain knowledge you know what
 

2149
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,570
lot of domain knowledge you know what
works how do you decrease the CCD and so

2150
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:12,580
works how do you decrease the CCD and so
 

2151
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:15,600
works how do you decrease the CCD and so
on and that's what they do so all the

2152
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:15,610
on and that's what they do so all the
 

2153
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:18,410
on and that's what they do so all the
drugs that are currently you know in the

2154
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:18,420
drugs that are currently you know in the
 

2155
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,090

deep understand it so like they just

2178
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:46,120
deep understand it so like they just
 

2179
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,730
deep understand it so like they just
observe it I mean they do deeply

2180
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:47,740
observe it I mean they do deeply
 

2181
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:48,900
observe it I mean they do deeply
understand chemistry and they do

2182
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:48,910
understand chemistry and they do
 

2183
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:51,030
understand chemistry and they do
understand how different groups and how

2184
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:51,040
understand how different groups and how
 

2185
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,400
understand how different groups and how
does it changes the properties so there

2186
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:53,410
does it changes the properties so there
 

2187
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:56,820
does it changes the properties so there
is a lot of science it gets into it and

2188
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:56,830
is a lot of science it gets into it and
 

2189
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:59,310
is a lot of science it gets into it and
a lot of kind of simulation how do you

2190
00:46:59,310 --> 00:46:59,320
a lot of kind of simulation how do you
 

2191
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:03,060
a lot of kind of simulation how do you
want it to behave it eats very very

2192
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:03,070
want it to behave it eats very very

00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:16,630
of times you know we have lots of
 

2207
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:17,970
of times you know we have lots of
diseases for which we don't have any

2208
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:17,980
diseases for which we don't have any
 

2209
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,380
diseases for which we don't have any
drugs and we don't even know how to

2210
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:19,390
drugs and we don't even know how to
 

2211
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:22,680
drugs and we don't even know how to
approach and don't need to mention few

2212
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:22,690
approach and don't need to mention few
 

2213
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:25,590
approach and don't need to mention few
drugs on your generative disease drugs

2214
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:25,600
drugs on your generative disease drugs
 

2215
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,930
drugs on your generative disease drugs
that fail you know so there are lots of

2216
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:27,940
that fail you know so there are lots of
 

2217
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,770
that fail you know so there are lots of
you know trials of face

2218
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:30,780
you know trials of face
 

2219
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:32,810
you know trials of face
you know in later stages which is really

2220
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:32,820
you know in later stages which is really
 

2221
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:34,280
you know in later stages which is really
catastrophic from the financial

2222
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:34,290
catastrophic from the financial
 

2223
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:37,580
catastrophic from the financial
perspective so you know is it is it the

2224
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:37,590
perspective so you know is it is it the
 

2225
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:39,140
perspective so you know is it is it the
effective the most effective mechanism

2226
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:39,150
effective the most effective mechanism
 

2227
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:41,240
effective the most effective mechanism
absolutely no but this is the only one

2228
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:41,250
absolutely no but this is the only one
 

2229
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:45,590
absolutely no but this is the only one
that currently works and I would you

2230
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:45,600
that currently works and I would you
 

2231
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,020
that currently works and I would you
know I was closely interacting was

2232
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:48,030
know I was closely interacting was
 

2233
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:49,400
know I was closely interacting was
fueling pharmaceutical industry I was

2234
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:49,410
fueling pharmaceutical industry I was
 

2235
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:52,160
fueling pharmaceutical industry I was
really fascinating on how sharp and and

2236
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:52,170
really fascinating on how sharp and and
 

2237
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:53,990
really fascinating on how sharp and and
what a deep understanding of the domain

2238
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:54,000
what a deep understanding of the domain
 

2239
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,240
what a deep understanding of the domain
do they have it's not an observation

2240
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:56,250
do they have it's not an observation
 

2241
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,160
do they have it's not an observation
driven it's there is really a lot of

2242
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:58,170
driven it's there is really a lot of
 

2243
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:00,530
driven it's there is really a lot of
science behind what they do but if you

2244
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:00,540
science behind what they do but if you
 

2245
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:02,330
science behind what they do but if you
ask me can machine learning change it I

2246
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:02,340
ask me can machine learning change it I
 

2247
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:06,200
ask me can machine learning change it I
firmly believe yes because even the most

2248
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:06,210
firmly believe yes because even the most
 

2249
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:08,750
firmly believe yes because even the most
experienced chemist cannot you know hold

2250
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:08,760
experienced chemist cannot you know hold
 

2251
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,210
experienced chemist cannot you know hold
in their memory and understanding ever

2252
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:11,220
in their memory and understanding ever
 

2253
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,740
in their memory and understanding ever
since you can learn you know from

2254
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:12,750
since you can learn you know from
 

2255
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:16,270
since you can learn you know from
millions of molecules and reactions and

2256
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:16,280
millions of molecules and reactions and
 

2257
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,250
millions of molecules and reactions and
and this piece of grass is a totally new

2258
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:19,260
and this piece of grass is a totally new
 

2259
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,410
and this piece of grass is a totally new
space I mean it's a it's a really

2260
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:21,420
space I mean it's a it's a really
 

2261
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:22,400
space I mean it's a it's a really
interesting space for machine learning

2262
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:22,410
interesting space for machine learning
 

2263
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:24,500
interesting space for machine learning
to explore graph generation yeah so

2264
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:24,510
to explore graph generation yeah so
 

2265
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:25,910
to explore graph generation yeah so
there's a lot of thing that you can do

2266
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:25,920
there's a lot of thing that you can do
 

2267
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,330
there's a lot of thing that you can do
here so we do a lot of work so the first

2268
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:29,340
here so we do a lot of work so the first
 

2269
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:32,600
here so we do a lot of work so the first
tool that we started with was the tool

2270
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:32,610
tool that we started with was the tool
 

2271
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:35,780
tool that we started with was the tool
that can predict properties of the

2272
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:35,790
that can predict properties of the
 

2273
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:37,250
that can predict properties of the
molecules so you can just give the

2274
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:37,260
molecules so you can just give the
 

2275
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,470
molecules so you can just give the
molecular molecule and the property it

2276
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:39,480
molecular molecule and the property it
 

2277
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,160
molecular molecule and the property it
can be by activity property or it can be

2278
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:42,170
can be by activity property or it can be
 

2279
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:45,650
can be by activity property or it can be
some other property and you train the

2280
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:45,660
some other property and you train the
 

2281
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:49,580
some other property and you train the
molecules and you can now take a new

2282
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:49,590
molecules and you can now take a new
 

2283
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:52,510
molecules and you can now take a new
molecule and predict this property now

2284
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:52,520
molecule and predict this property now
 

2285
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,710
molecule and predict this property now
when people started working in this area

2286
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:54,720
when people started working in this area
 

2287
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,240
when people started working in this area
it is something very simple and they're

2288
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:56,250
it is something very simple and they're
 

2289
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:58,580
it is something very simple and they're
kind of existing you know fingerprints

2290
00:48:58,580 --> 00:48:58,590
kind of existing you know fingerprints
 

2291
00:48:58,590 --> 00:49:00,320
kind of existing you know fingerprints
which is kind of handcrafted features of

2292
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:00,330
which is kind of handcrafted features of
 

2293
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:02,120
which is kind of handcrafted features of
the molecule when you break the graph to

2294
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:02,130
the molecule when you break the graph to
 

2295
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:03,920
the molecule when you break the graph to
substructures and then you run it in a

2296
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:03,930
substructures and then you run it in a
 

2297
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:06,560
substructures and then you run it in a
feed-forward neural network and what it

2298
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:06,570
feed-forward neural network and what it
 

2299
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:08,120
feed-forward neural network and what it
was interesting to see that clearly you

2300
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:08,130
was interesting to see that clearly you
 

2301
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:10,280
was interesting to see that clearly you
know this was not the most effective way

2302
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:10,290
know this was not the most effective way
 

2303
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:11,840
know this was not the most effective way
to proceed and you need to have much

2304
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:11,850
to proceed and you need to have much
 

2305
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:15,350
to proceed and you need to have much
more complex models that can induce the

2306
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:15,360
more complex models that can induce the
 

2307
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,240
more complex models that can induce the
representation which can translate this

2308
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:17,250
representation which can translate this
 

2309
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:19,790
representation which can translate this
graph into the embeddings and and do

2310
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:19,800
graph into the embeddings and and do
 

2311
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,890
graph into the embeddings and and do
these predictions so this is one

2312
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:21,900
these predictions so this is one
 

2313
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,500
these predictions so this is one
direction and another direction which is

2314
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:24,510
direction and another direction which is
 

2315
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:27,560
direction and another direction which is
kind of related is not only to stop by

2316
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:27,570
kind of related is not only to stop by
 

2317
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:29,300
kind of related is not only to stop by
looking at the embedding itself but

2318
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:29,310
looking at the embedding itself but
 

2319
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:32,060
looking at the embedding itself but
actually modify it to produce better

2320
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:32,070
actually modify it to produce better
 

2321
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:34,340
actually modify it to produce better
molecules so you can think about it as

2322
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:34,350
molecules so you can think about it as
 

2323
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:36,410
molecules so you can think about it as
the machine translation that you can

2324
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:36,420
the machine translation that you can
 

2325
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,660
the machine translation that you can
start with a molecule and then there is

2326
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:38,670
start with a molecule and then there is
 

2327
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:40,820
start with a molecule and then there is
an improved version of molecular and you

2328
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:40,830
an improved version of molecular and you
 

2329
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:43,010
an improved version of molecular and you
can again within coda translate it into

2330
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:43,020
can again within coda translate it into
 

2331
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,480
can again within coda translate it into
the hidden space and then learn how to

2332
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:44,490
the hidden space and then learn how to
 

2333
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:47,080
the hidden space and then learn how to
modify to improve the in some ways

2334
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:47,090
modify to improve the in some ways
 

2335
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:50,600
modify to improve the in some ways
version of the molecules so that's it's

2336
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:50,610
version of the molecules so that's it's
 

2337
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:53,540
version of the molecules so that's it's
kind of really exciting we already seen

2338
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:53,550
kind of really exciting we already seen
 

2339
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:54,920
kind of really exciting we already seen
that the property prediction works

2340
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:54,930
that the property prediction works
 

2341
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:56,859
that the property prediction works
pretty well and now

2342
00:49:56,859 --> 00:49:56,869
pretty well and now
 

2343
00:49:56,869 --> 00:50:00,430
pretty well and now
we are generating molecules and there is

2344
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:00,440
we are generating molecules and there is
 

2345
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:03,519
we are generating molecules and there is
actually loves which are manufacturing

2346
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:03,529
actually loves which are manufacturing
 

2347
00:50:03,529 --> 00:50:05,319
actually loves which are manufacturing
this molecule so we'll see why it will

2348
00:50:05,319 --> 00:50:05,329
this molecule so we'll see why it will
 

2349
00:50:05,329 --> 00:50:07,479
this molecule so we'll see why it will
get us okay that's really exciting that

2350
00:50:07,479 --> 00:50:07,489
get us okay that's really exciting that
 

2351
00:50:07,489 --> 00:50:08,769
get us okay that's really exciting that
so there's a lot of promise

2352
00:50:08,769 --> 00:50:08,779
so there's a lot of promise
 

2353
00:50:08,779 --> 00:50:10,719
so there's a lot of promise
speaking of machine translation and

2354
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:10,729
speaking of machine translation and
 

2355
00:50:10,729 --> 00:50:13,180
speaking of machine translation and
embeddings I think you do you have done

2356
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:13,190
embeddings I think you do you have done
 

2357
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:15,940
embeddings I think you do you have done
a lot of really great research in NLP

2358
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:15,950
a lot of really great research in NLP
 

2359
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:19,690
a lot of really great research in NLP
natural language processing can you tell

2360
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:19,700
natural language processing can you tell
 

2361
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:22,059
natural language processing can you tell
me your journey through NLP what ideas

2362
00:50:22,059 --> 00:50:22,069

problems approaches were you working on

2364
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:24,920
problems approaches were you working on
 

2365

for my working in LP it was the 97th

2372
00:50:37,259 --> 00:50:37,269
for my working in LP it was the 97th
 

2373
00:50:37,269 --> 00:50:39,670
for my working in LP it was the 97th
this is very interesting time it was

2374
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:39,680
this is very interesting time it was
 

2375
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,940
this is very interesting time it was
exactly the time that I came to ACL and

2376
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:42,950
exactly the time that I came to ACL and
 

2377
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:44,769
exactly the time that I came to ACL and
the time I could barely understand

2378
00:50:44,769 --> 00:50:44,779
the time I could barely understand
 

2379
00:50:44,779 --> 00:50:47,620
the time I could barely understand
English but it was exactly like the

2380
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:47,630
English but it was exactly like the
 

2381
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:49,150
English but it was exactly like the
transition point because half of the

and then they were the first generation

2392
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:01,400
and then they were the first generation
 

2393
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,420
and then they were the first generation
of papers which were corpus based papers

2394
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:04,430
of papers which were corpus based papers
 

2395
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:06,219
of papers which were corpus based papers
and they were very simple in our terms

2396
00:51:06,219 --> 00:51:06,229
and they were very simple in our terms
 

2397
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,140
and they were very simple in our terms
when you collect some statistics and do

when you collect some statistics and do
 

2399
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:10,630
when you collect some statistics and do
prediction based on them and I found it

2400
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:10,640
prediction based on them and I found it
 

2401
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,459
prediction based on them and I found it
really fascinating that you know one

2402
00:51:12,459 --> 00:51:12,469
really fascinating that you know one
 

2403
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:15,160
really fascinating that you know one

about you know about the problem and I

2406
00:51:20,039 --> 00:51:20,049
about you know about the problem and I
 

2407
00:51:20,049 --> 00:51:22,870
about you know about the problem and I
remember the first paper that I wrote it

2408
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:22,880
remember the first paper that I wrote it
 

2409
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,819
remember the first paper that I wrote it
didn't have a single formula it didn't

2410
00:51:24,819 --> 00:51:24,829
didn't have a single formula it didn't
 

2411

didn't have a single formula it didn't
have evaluation it just had examples of

00:51:27,489 --> 00:51:27,499
have evaluation it just had examples of
 

2413
00:51:27,499 --> 00:51:30,069
have evaluation it just had examples of
outputs and this was a standard of the

2414
00:51:30,069 --> 00:51:30,079
outputs and this was a standard of the
 

2415
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,799

people maybe just started emphasizing

00:51:35,769 --> 00:51:35,779
people maybe just started emphasizing
 

2419
00:51:35,779 --> 00:51:38,289
people maybe just started emphasizing
the empirical evaluation but for many

2420
00:51:38,289 --> 00:51:38,299
the empirical evaluation but for many
 

2421
00:51:38,299 --> 00:51:39,910

applications like summarization your
 

2423

interest or some examples of outwards
 

2425
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:44,620
interest or some examples of outwards
and then increasingly you can see that

00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:44,630
and then increasingly you can see that
 

2427
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:46,690
and then increasingly you can see that

00:53:46,819 --> 00:53:46,829
imagine that within you know 10 years we
 

2527
00:53:46,829 --> 00:53:48,740
imagine that within you know 10 years we
would already see the system working and

would already see the system working and
 

2529
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:51,710
would already see the system working and
now you know nobody is even surprised to

now you know nobody is even surprised to
 

2531
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,530
now you know nobody is even surprised to
utilize the system on daily basis so

2532
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:54,540
utilize the system on daily basis so
 

2533
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:55,940
utilize the system on daily basis so
this was like a huge huge progress

do to our brains so my point is you know
how much it's not how good is the

2834
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:18,180
how much it's not how good is the
 

2835
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:21,560
how much it's not how good is the
technology is how ready we are to

2836
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:21,570
technology is how ready we are to
 

2837
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:23,930
technology is how ready we are to
believe that it delivers the goods that

2838
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:23,940
believe that it delivers the goods that
 

2839
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:25,200
believe that it delivers the goods that
we are trying to get

2840
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:25,210
we are trying to get
 

2841
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:27,000
we are trying to get
that's a really beautiful way to put it

2842
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:27,010
that's a really beautiful way to put it
 

2843
01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:29,190
that's a really beautiful way to put it
I I by the way I'm not horrified by that

2844
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:29,200
I I by the way I'm not horrified by that
 

2845
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,390
I I by the way I'm not horrified by that
possibility but inspired by it because I

2846
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:32,400
possibility but inspired by it because I
 

2847
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,299
possibility but inspired by it because I
mean human connection whether it's

2848
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:36,309
mean human connection whether it's
 

2849
01:00:36,309 --> 01:00:39,900
mean human connection whether it's
through language or through love it it

2850
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:39,910
through language or through love it it
 

2851
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:43,920
through language or through love it it
seems like it's very amenable to machine

2852
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:43,930
seems like it's very amenable to machine
 

2853
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:48,059
seems like it's very amenable to machine
learning and the rest is just challenges

2854
01:00:48,059 --> 01:00:48,069
learning and the rest is just challenges
 

2855
01:00:48,069 --> 01:00:49,799
learning and the rest is just challenges

secretaries who enjoy spending hours I

2858
01:00:52,529 --> 01:00:52,539
secretaries who enjoy spending hours I
 

2859
01:00:52,539 --> 01:00:53,970
secretaries who enjoy spending hours I
would say I would describe most of our

2860
01:00:53,970 --> 01:00:53,980
would say I would describe most of our
 

2861
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:56,910
would say I would describe most of our
lives as enjoying spending hours with

those we love for very silly reasons all

2864
01:01:00,809 --> 01:01:00,819
those we love for very silly reasons all
 

2865
01:01:00,819 --> 01:01:02,609
those we love for very silly reasons all
we're doing is keyword matching as well

2866
01:01:02,609 --> 01:01:02,619
we're doing is keyword matching as well
 

2867
01:01:02,619 --> 01:01:05,190
we're doing is keyword matching as well
so I'm not sure how much intelligence we

2868
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:05,200
so I'm not sure how much intelligence we
 

2869
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,319
so I'm not sure how much intelligence we
exhibit to each other you know with the

2870
01:01:07,319 --> 01:01:07,329
exhibit to each other you know with the
 

2871
01:01:07,329 --> 01:01:09,930
exhibit to each other you know with the
people we love that we're close with so

2872
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:09,940
people we love that we're close with so
 

2873
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:13,049
people we love that we're close with so
it's a very interesting point of what it

2874
01:01:13,049 --> 01:01:13,059
it's a very interesting point of what it
 

2875
01:01:13,059 --> 01:01:14,849
it's a very interesting point of what it
means to pass the Turing test

2876
01:01:14,849 --> 01:01:14,859
means to pass the Turing test
 

2877
01:01:14,859 --> 01:01:16,799
means to pass the Turing test
well language I think you're right in

2878
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:16,809
well language I think you're right in
 

2879
01:01:16,809 --> 01:01:17,910
well language I think you're right in
terms of conversation

2880
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:17,920
terms of conversation
 

2881
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:21,599
terms of conversation
I think machine translation is it has

2882
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:21,609
I think machine translation is it has
 

2883
01:01:21,609 --> 01:01:23,549
I think machine translation is it has
very clear performance and improvement

2884
01:01:23,549 --> 01:01:23,559
very clear performance and improvement
 

2885
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:26,089
very clear performance and improvement
right what it means to have a fulfilling

2886
01:01:26,089 --> 01:01:26,099
right what it means to have a fulfilling
 

2887
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:30,299
right what it means to have a fulfilling
conversation is very very person

2888
01:01:30,299 --> 01:01:30,309
conversation is very very person
 

2889
01:01:30,309 --> 01:01:32,940
conversation is very very person
dependent and context dependent and so

2890
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:32,950
dependent and context dependent and so
 

2891
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:36,180
dependent and context dependent and so
on that's a yeah it's very well put so

2892
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:36,190
on that's a yeah it's very well put so
 

2893
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:39,510
on that's a yeah it's very well put so
but in your view what's a benchmark a

2894
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:39,520
but in your view what's a benchmark a
 

2895
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,480
but in your view what's a benchmark a
natural language a test that's just out

2896
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:42,490
natural language a test that's just out
 

2897
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:44,519
natural language a test that's just out
of reach right now but we might be able

2898
01:01:44,519 --> 01:01:44,529
of reach right now but we might be able
 

2899
01:01:44,529 --> 01:01:47,250
of reach right now but we might be able
to that's exciting is it a machine isn't

2900
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:47,260
to that's exciting is it a machine isn't
 

2901
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:49,380
to that's exciting is it a machine isn't
perfecting machine translation or is

01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:47,540
there are you at all excited curious by
the possibility of creating human level

in your discussion so if we're looking
 

2949
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:56,630
in your discussion so if we're looking
at oncology you're trying to use machine

01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:00,080
learning to help the world in terms of
alleviating suffering if you look at

01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:00,090
alleviating suffering if you look at
 

2955
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:02,900
alleviating suffering if you look at
natural language processing you focus on

2956
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:02,910
natural language processing you focus on
 

2957
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:05,000

things like machine translation but you

2960
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:07,230
things like machine translation but you
 

2961
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:09,500
things like machine translation but you
know human level intelligence is the

2962
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:09,510
know human level intelligence is the
 

2963
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:11,960
know human level intelligence is the
thing that our civilization is dreaming

2964
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:11,970
thing that our civilization is dreaming
 

2965
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:15,020
thing that our civilization is dreaming
about creating superhuman level

2966
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:15,030
about creating superhuman level
 

2967
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:17,000
about creating superhuman level
intelligence do you think about this do

2968
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:17,010
intelligence do you think about this do
 

2969
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:19,510
intelligence do you think about this do
you think it's at all within our reach

2970
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:19,520
you think it's at all within our reach
 

2971
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:22,340
you think it's at all within our reach
so as you said to yourself for any I'm

2972
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:22,350
so as you said to yourself for any I'm
 

2973
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:25,670
so as you said to yourself for any I'm
talking about you know how do you

2974
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:25,680
talking about you know how do you
 

2975
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,160
talking about you know how do you
perceive you know our communications

2976
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:28,170
perceive you know our communications
 

2977
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:29,660
perceive you know our communications
with each other that you know we're

2978
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:29,670
with each other that you know we're
 

2979
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:31,700
with each other that you know we're
matching keywords and certain behaviors

2980
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:31,710
matching keywords and certain behaviors
 

2981
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:36,230
matching keywords and certain behaviors
and so all so in the end whenever one

2982
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:36,240
and so all so in the end whenever one
 

2983
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,850
and so all so in the end whenever one
assesses let's say relations with

2984
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:37,860
assesses let's say relations with
 

2985
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:40,070
assesses let's say relations with
another person you have a separate kind

2986
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:40,080
another person you have a separate kind
 

2987
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,870
another person you have a separate kind
of measurements and outcomes inside you

2988
01:03:41,870 --> 01:03:41,880
of measurements and outcomes inside you
 

2989
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:44,060
of measurements and outcomes inside you
had the determine you know what is the

2990
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:44,070
had the determine you know what is the
 

2991
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:47,420
had the determine you know what is the
status of the relation so one way and

2992
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:47,430
status of the relation so one way and
 

2993
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:49,040
status of the relation so one way and
this is classical dilemma what is the

2994
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:49,050
this is classical dilemma what is the
 

2995
01:03:49,050 --> 01:03:50,540
this is classical dilemma what is the
intelligence is it the fact that now we

2996
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:50,550
intelligence is it the fact that now we
 

2997
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:52,460
intelligence is it the fact that now we
are gonna do the same way as human is

2998
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:52,470
are gonna do the same way as human is
 

2999
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:54,110
are gonna do the same way as human is
doing when we don't even understand what

3000
01:03:54,110 --> 01:03:54,120
doing when we don't even understand what
 

3001
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:57,110
doing when we don't even understand what
the human is doing or we now have an

3002
01:03:57,110 --> 01:03:57,120
the human is doing or we now have an
 

3003
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:59,390
the human is doing or we now have an
ability to deliver this outcomes but not

3004
01:03:59,390 --> 01:03:59,400
ability to deliver this outcomes but not
 

3005
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,610
ability to deliver this outcomes but not
in one area not in a non fear not just

3006
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:01,620
in one area not in a non fear not just
 

3007
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:03,080
in one area not in a non fear not just
to translate or just answer questions

3008
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:03,090
to translate or just answer questions
 

3009
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:05,990
to translate or just answer questions
but it was many many areas that we can

3010
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:06,000
but it was many many areas that we can
 

3011
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,720
but it was many many areas that we can
achieve the functionality is that humans

3012
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:08,730
achieve the functionality is that humans
 

3013
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:10,910
achieve the functionality is that humans
can achieve with the ability to learn

3014
01:04:10,910 --> 01:04:10,920
can achieve with the ability to learn
 

3015
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:13,850
can achieve with the ability to learn
and do other things I think this is and

3016
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:13,860
and do other things I think this is and
 

3017
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:16,550
and do other things I think this is and
this we can actually measure how far we

3018
01:04:16,550 --> 01:04:16,560
this we can actually measure how far we
 

3019
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:20,210
this we can actually measure how far we
are and that's what makes me excited

3020
01:04:20,210 --> 01:04:20,220
are and that's what makes me excited
 

3021
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:22,670
are and that's what makes me excited
that we you know in my lifetime at least

3022
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:22,680
that we you know in my lifetime at least
 

3023
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,100
that we you know in my lifetime at least
so far what we've seen it's like

3024
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:24,110
so far what we've seen it's like
 

3025
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,480
so far what we've seen it's like
tremendous progress across with these

3026
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:26,490
tremendous progress across with these
 

3027
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:30,260
tremendous progress across with these
different functionalities and I think it

3028
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:30,270
different functionalities and I think it
 

3029
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:34,760
different functionalities and I think it
will be really exciting to see where we

3030
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:34,770
will be really exciting to see where we
 

3031
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:39,020
will be really exciting to see where we
will be and again one way to think about

3032
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:39,030
will be and again one way to think about
 

3033
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:40,280
will be and again one way to think about
is there are machines which are

3034
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:40,290
is there are machines which are
 

3035
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:42,140
is there are machines which are
improving their functionality another

3036
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:42,150
improving their functionality another
 

3037
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:44,720
improving their functionality another
one is to think about us with our brains

3038
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:44,730
one is to think about us with our brains
 

3039
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:47,330
one is to think about us with our brains
which I'm perfect how they can be

3040
01:04:47,330 --> 01:04:47,340
which I'm perfect how they can be
 

3041
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:51,890
which I'm perfect how they can be
accelerated by this technology

3042
01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:51,900
accelerated by this technology
 

3043
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:55,269
accelerated by this technology
as it becomes stronger and stronger

3044
01:04:55,269 --> 01:04:55,279
as it becomes stronger and stronger
 

3045
01:04:55,279 --> 01:04:58,249
as it becomes stronger and stronger
coming back to another book that I love

3046
01:04:58,249 --> 01:04:58,259
coming back to another book that I love
 

3047
01:04:58,259 --> 01:05:01,579
coming back to another book that I love
flowers for algernon have you read this

3048
01:05:01,579 --> 01:05:01,589
flowers for algernon have you read this
 

3049
01:05:01,589 --> 01:05:03,890
flowers for algernon have you read this
book yes so there is this point that

3050
01:05:03,890 --> 01:05:03,900
book yes so there is this point that
 

3051
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,380
book yes so there is this point that
then the patient gets this miracle cure

3052
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:06,390
then the patient gets this miracle cure
 

3053
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:08,660
then the patient gets this miracle cure
which changes his brain and of a sudden

3054
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:08,670
which changes his brain and of a sudden
 

3055
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:11,480
which changes his brain and of a sudden
the he life in a different way and can

3056
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:11,490
the he life in a different way and can
 

3057
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:13,670
the he life in a different way and can
do certain things better but certain

3058
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:13,680
do certain things better but certain
 

3059
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,960
do certain things better but certain
things much worse

3060
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:15,970
things much worse
 

3061
01:05:15,970 --> 01:05:19,800
things much worse
so you can imagine this kind of computer

3062
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:19,810
so you can imagine this kind of computer
 

3063
01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:23,430
so you can imagine this kind of computer
augmented cognition where it can bring

3064
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:23,440
augmented cognition where it can bring
 

3065
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,080
augmented cognition where it can bring
you that now in the same way as you know

3066
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:25,090
you that now in the same way as you know
 

3067
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:27,870
you that now in the same way as you know
the cars enable us to get to places

3068
01:05:27,870 --> 01:05:27,880
the cars enable us to get to places
 

3069
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,270
the cars enable us to get to places
where we've never been before can we

3070
01:05:30,270 --> 01:05:30,280
where we've never been before can we
 

3071
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:33,000
where we've never been before can we
think differently can we think faster so

3072
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:33,010
think differently can we think faster so
 

3073
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:35,760
think differently can we think faster so
and we already see a lot of it happening

3074
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:35,770
and we already see a lot of it happening
 

3075
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:40,020
and we already see a lot of it happening
in how it impacts us but I think we have

3076
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:40,030
in how it impacts us but I think we have
 

3077
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:43,400
in how it impacts us but I think we have
a long way to go there so that's sort of

3078
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:43,410
a long way to go there so that's sort of
 

3079
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:45,630
a long way to go there so that's sort of
artificial intelligence and technology

3080
01:05:45,630 --> 01:05:45,640
artificial intelligence and technology
 

3081
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:48,090
artificial intelligence and technology
affecting our augmenting our

01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:52,000
intelligence as humans yesterday a
 

3085
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,230
intelligence as humans yesterday a
company called neural link announced

3086
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:55,240
company called neural link announced
 

3087
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,910
company called neural link announced
they do this whole demonstration I don't

3088
01:05:56,910 --> 01:05:56,920
they do this whole demonstration I don't
 

3089
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:59,010
they do this whole demonstration I don't
know if you saw it it's they

3090
01:05:59,010 --> 01:05:59,020
know if you saw it it's they
 

3091
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:01,140
know if you saw it it's they
demonstrated brain computer brain

3092
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:01,150
demonstrated brain computer brain
 

3093
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:03,210
demonstrated brain computer brain
machine interface whether it's like a

3094
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:03,220
machine interface whether it's like a
 

3095
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:06,630
machine interface whether it's like a
sewing machine for the brain do you uh

3096
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:06,640
sewing machine for the brain do you uh
 

3097
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:09,990
sewing machine for the brain do you uh
you know a lot of that is quite out

3098
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:10,000
you know a lot of that is quite out
 

3099
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,900
you know a lot of that is quite out
there in terms of things that some

3100
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:12,910
there in terms of things that some
 

3101
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:15,330
there in terms of things that some
people would say are impossible but

3102
01:06:15,330 --> 01:06:15,340
people would say are impossible but
 

3103
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:17,070
people would say are impossible but
there are dreamers and want to engineer

3104
01:06:17,070 --> 01:06:17,080
there are dreamers and want to engineer
 

3105
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:19,380
there are dreamers and want to engineer
systems like that do you see based on

3106
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:19,390
systems like that do you see based on
 

3107
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:21,720
systems like that do you see based on
what you just said I hope for that more

3108
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:21,730
what you just said I hope for that more
 

3109
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:25,230
what you just said I hope for that more
direct interaction with the brain i I

3110
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:25,240
direct interaction with the brain i I
 

3111
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:27,360
direct interaction with the brain i I
think there are different ways one is a

3112
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:27,370
think there are different ways one is a
 

3113
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:29,070
think there are different ways one is a
direct interaction with the brain and

3114
01:06:29,070 --> 01:06:29,080
direct interaction with the brain and
 

3115
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,870
direct interaction with the brain and
again there are lots of companies that

3116
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:30,880
again there are lots of companies that
 

3117
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,700
again there are lots of companies that
work in this space and I think there

3118
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:32,710
work in this space and I think there
 

3119
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:35,280
work in this space and I think there
will be a lot of developments when I'm

3120
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:35,290
will be a lot of developments when I'm
 

3121
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:36,780
will be a lot of developments when I'm
just saying that many times we are not

3122
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:36,790
just saying that many times we are not
 

3123
01:06:36,790 --> 01:06:40,020
just saying that many times we are not
aware of our feelings of motivation what

3124
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:40,030
aware of our feelings of motivation what
 

3125
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:42,540
aware of our feelings of motivation what
drives us like let me give you a trivial

3126
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:42,550
drives us like let me give you a trivial
 

3127
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:46,110
drives us like let me give you a trivial
example our attention there are a lot of

3128
01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:46,120
example our attention there are a lot of
 

3129
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:47,880
example our attention there are a lot of
studies in demonstrate that it takes a

3130
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:47,890
studies in demonstrate that it takes a
 

3131
01:06:47,890 --> 01:06:49,260
studies in demonstrate that it takes a
while to a person to understand that

3132
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:49,270
while to a person to understand that
 

3133
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:51,480
while to a person to understand that
they are not attentive anymore and we

3134
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:51,490
they are not attentive anymore and we
 

3135
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:52,350
they are not attentive anymore and we
know that there are people who really

3136
01:06:52,350 --> 01:06:52,360
know that there are people who really
 

3137
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:54,480
know that there are people who really
have strong capacity to hold the tension

3138
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:54,490
have strong capacity to hold the tension
 

3139
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:55,740
have strong capacity to hold the tension
there are another end of the spectrum

3140
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:55,750
there are another end of the spectrum
 

3141
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:58,110
there are another end of the spectrum
people with a DD and other issues they

3142
01:06:58,110 --> 01:06:58,120
people with a DD and other issues they
 

3143
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:00,170
people with a DD and other issues they

imagine to yourself do you have like a

3146
01:07:02,490 --> 01:07:02,500
imagine to yourself do you have like a
 

3147
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,800
imagine to yourself do you have like a
cognitive aid this just alerts you based

01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:04,810
cognitive aid this just alerts you based
 

3149
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:07,560
cognitive aid this just alerts you based
on your gaze that your attention is now

3150
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:07,570
on your gaze that your attention is now
 

3151
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:09,840
on your gaze that your attention is now
not on what you are doing and it's sort

3152
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:09,850
not on what you are doing and it's sort
 

3153
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:11,250
not on what you are doing and it's sort
of writing a paper you're now dreaming

3154
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:11,260
of writing a paper you're now dreaming
 

3155
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:12,360
of writing a paper you're now dreaming
of what you're going to do in the

01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:12,370
of what you're going to do in the
 

3157
01:07:12,370 --> 01:07:15,150
of what you're going to do in the
evening so even this kind of simple

3158
01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:15,160
evening so even this kind of simple
 

3159
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,100
evening so even this kind of simple
measurement things how they can change

3160
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:17,110
measurement things how they can change
 

3161
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:19,560
measurement things how they can change
us and I see it even in these simple

3162
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:19,570
us and I see it even in these simple
 

3163
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:25,110
us and I see it even in these simple
ways with myself I have my zone up from

01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:25,120
ways with myself I have my zone up from
 

3165
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:27,270
ways with myself I have my zone up from
that I go to MIT gym it kind of records

3166
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:27,280
that I go to MIT gym it kind of records

you know how much the Duran and you have

3168
01:07:29,290 --> 01:07:29,300
you know how much the Duran and you have
 

3169
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:31,840
you know how much the Duran and you have
points and you could get some status

3170
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:31,850
points and you could get some status
 

3171
01:07:31,850 --> 01:07:35,380

thing who would ever care about some

3174
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:37,130
thing who would ever care about some
 

3175
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:39,970
thing who would ever care about some
status in some up guess what so took it

3176
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:39,980
status in some up guess what so took it
 

3177
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:41,890
status in some up guess what so took it
to me to contain the status you have to

3178
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:41,900
to me to contain the status you have to
 

3179
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:43,810
to me to contain the status you have to
do certain number of points every month

3180
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:43,820
do certain number of points every month
 

3181
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:46,930
do certain number of points every month
and not only is that they do it every

3182
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:46,940
and not only is that they do it every
 

3183
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:50,650
and not only is that they do it every
single month for the last 18 months it

single month for the last 18 months it
went to the poem that I was running and

3186
01:07:52,810 --> 01:07:52,820
went to the poem that I was running and
 

3187
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:55,120
went to the poem that I was running and
the day I was injured and when I could

3188
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:55,130
the day I was injured and when I could
 

3189
01:07:55,130 --> 01:08:00,670
the day I was injured and when I could
run again I in two days I did like some

3190
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:00,680
run again I in two days I did like some
 

3191
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:03,490
run again I in two days I did like some
humongous amount of ready to complete

3192
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:03,500
humongous amount of ready to complete
 

3193
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:05,380
humongous amount of ready to complete
the point I was like really not safe

3194
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:05,390
the point I was like really not safe
 

3195
01:08:05,390 --> 01:08:10,420

you can already see that this direct

3198
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:12,590
you can already see that this direct
 

3199
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:14,950
you can already see that this direct
measurement and the feedback it's you

3200
01:08:14,950 --> 01:08:14,960
measurement and the feedback it's you
 

3201
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,360
measurement and the feedback it's you
know we're looking at video games and

3202
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:16,370
know we're looking at video games and
 

3203
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:18,550
know we're looking at video games and
see why you know the addiction aspect of

3204
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:18,560
see why you know the addiction aspect of
 

3205
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,050
see why you know the addiction aspect of
it but you can imagine that the same

3206
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:20,060
it but you can imagine that the same
 

3207
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:22,150
it but you can imagine that the same
idea can be expanded to many other areas

3208
01:08:22,150 --> 01:08:22,160
idea can be expanded to many other areas
 

3209
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:25,450
idea can be expanded to many other areas
of our life when we really can get

3210
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:25,460
of our life when we really can get
 

3211
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:27,460
of our life when we really can get
feedback and imagine in your case in

3212
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:27,470
feedback and imagine in your case in
 

3213
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:30,700
feedback and imagine in your case in
relations when we are doing keyword

3214
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:30,710
relations when we are doing keyword
 

3215
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:32,260
relations when we are doing keyword
matching imagine that the person who is

3216
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:32,270
matching imagine that the person who is
 

3217
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:36,670
matching imagine that the person who is
generating the keywords that first one

3218
01:08:36,670 --> 01:08:36,680
generating the keywords that first one
 

3219
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,349
generating the keywords that first one
gets direct feedback before the whole

3220
01:08:38,349 --> 01:08:38,359
gets direct feedback before the whole
 

3221
01:08:38,359 --> 01:08:42,099
gets direct feedback before the whole
thing explodes is it maybe a point we

3222
01:08:42,099 --> 01:08:42,109
thing explodes is it maybe a point we
 

3223
01:08:42,109 --> 01:08:44,400
thing explodes is it maybe a point we
are going in the wrong direction

3224
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:44,410
are going in the wrong direction
 

3225
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:48,670
are going in the wrong direction
really behavior modifying moment so yeah

3226
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:48,680
really behavior modifying moment so yeah
 

3227
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:51,670
really behavior modifying moment so yeah
it's a relationship management - so yeah

3228
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:51,680
it's a relationship management - so yeah
 

3229
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:53,770
it's a relationship management - so yeah
that's that's a fascinating whole area

3230
01:08:53,770 --> 01:08:53,780
that's that's a fascinating whole area
 

3231
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:56,530
that's that's a fascinating whole area
of psychology actually as well as seeing

3232
01:08:56,530 --> 01:08:56,540
of psychology actually as well as seeing
 

3233
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:58,590
of psychology actually as well as seeing
how our behavior has changed with

3234
01:08:58,590 --> 01:08:58,600
how our behavior has changed with
 

3235
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:01,240
how our behavior has changed with
basically all human relations now have

3236
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:01,250
basically all human relations now have
 

3237
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:05,110
basically all human relations now have
other non-human entities helping us out

3238
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:05,120
other non-human entities helping us out
 

3239
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:10,000
other non-human entities helping us out
so you uh you teach a large a huge

3240
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:10,010
so you uh you teach a large a huge
 

3241
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:13,260
so you uh you teach a large a huge
machine learning course here at MIT I

3242
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:13,270
machine learning course here at MIT I
 

3243
01:09:13,270 --> 01:09:15,450
machine learning course here at MIT I
can ask you a million questions but

3244
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:15,460
can ask you a million questions but
 

3245
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:18,160
can ask you a million questions but
you've seen a lot of students what ideas

3246
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:18,170
you've seen a lot of students what ideas
 

3247
01:09:18,170 --> 01:09:20,620
you've seen a lot of students what ideas
do students struggle with the most as

3248
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:20,630
do students struggle with the most as
 

3249
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:23,320
do students struggle with the most as
they first enter this world of machine

3250
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:23,330
they first enter this world of machine
 

3251
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:27,400
they first enter this world of machine
learning actually this year was the

3252
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:27,410
learning actually this year was the
 

3253
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:29,020
learning actually this year was the
first time I started teaching a small

3254
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:29,030
first time I started teaching a small
 

3255
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:31,390
first time I started teaching a small
machine learning class and it came as a

3256
01:09:31,390 --> 01:09:31,400
machine learning class and it came as a
 

3257
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:34,570
machine learning class and it came as a
result of what I saw in my big machine

3258
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:34,580
result of what I saw in my big machine
 

3259
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:36,220
result of what I saw in my big machine
learning class the to me Ackland I build

3260
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:36,230
learning class the to me Ackland I build
 

3261
01:09:36,230 --> 01:09:38,900
learning class the to me Ackland I build
maybe six years ago

3262
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:38,910
maybe six years ago
 

3263
01:09:38,910 --> 01:09:41,780
maybe six years ago
what we've seen that as this area become

3264
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:41,790
what we've seen that as this area become
 

3265
01:09:41,790 --> 01:09:43,700
what we've seen that as this area become
more and more popular more and more

3266
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:43,710
more and more popular more and more
 

3267
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:46,070
more and more popular more and more
people at MIT want to take this class

3268
01:09:46,070 --> 01:09:46,080
people at MIT want to take this class
 

3269
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,860
people at MIT want to take this class
and while we designed it for computer

3270
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:48,870
and while we designed it for computer
 

3271
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:50,660
and while we designed it for computer
science majors there were a lot of

3272
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:50,670
science majors there were a lot of
 

3273
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:52,580
science majors there were a lot of
people who really I interested to learn

3274
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:52,590
people who really I interested to learn
 

3275
01:09:52,590 --> 01:09:55,010
people who really I interested to learn
in but unfortunately their background

3276
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:55,020
in but unfortunately their background
 

3277
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:58,250
in but unfortunately their background
was not enabling them to do well in the

3278
01:09:58,250 --> 01:09:58,260
was not enabling them to do well in the
 

3279
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:00,290
was not enabling them to do well in the
class and many of them associated

3280
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:00,300
class and many of them associated
 

3281
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:01,880
class and many of them associated
machine learning with the would struggle

3282
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:01,890
machine learning with the would struggle
 

3283
01:10:01,890 --> 01:10:05,750
machine learning with the would struggle
in failure primarily for non-majors

3284
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:05,760
in failure primarily for non-majors
 

3285
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,000
in failure primarily for non-majors
and that's why which restarts the new

3286
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:08,010
and that's why which restarts the new
 

3287
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:10,520
and that's why which restarts the new
class which we call machine learning

3288
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:10,530
class which we call machine learning
 

3289
01:10:10,530 --> 01:10:13,510
class which we call machine learning
from algorithms to modeling which

from algorithms to modeling which
 

3291
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:16,370
from algorithms to modeling which
emphasizes more the modeling aspects of

01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:20,930
emphasizes more the modeling aspects of

it and focuses on it has majors and
 

3295
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:24,020
it and focuses on it has majors and
non-majors so we kind of try to extract

3296
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:24,030
non-majors so we kind of try to extract
 

3297
01:10:24,030 --> 01:10:26,090
non-majors so we kind of try to extract
the relevant paths and make it more

created at different levels and you can
 

3413
01:12:50,489 --> 01:12:55,070
created at different levels and you can
find online on school classes which are

3414
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:55,080
find online on school classes which are
 

3415
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,439
find online on school classes which are
more mathematical more applied and so on

more mathematical more applied and so on
 

3417
01:12:57,449 --> 01:13:01,430
more mathematical more applied and so on
so you can find kind of a preacher which

01:13:01,430 --> 01:13:01,440
so you can find kind of a preacher which
 

3419
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,590
so you can find kind of a preacher which
preaches your own language where you can

different types of contribution
 

3425
01:13:06,659 --> 01:13:08,720
different types of contribution
depending of you know what is your

3426
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:08,730
depending of you know what is your
 

3427
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:12,500
depending of you know what is your
strengths and the second point I think

3428
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:12,510
strengths and the second point I think
 

3429
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:15,110
strengths and the second point I think
it's really important to find some area

it's really important to find some area
 

3431
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,270
it's really important to find some area
which you which you really care about

which you which you really care about
 

3433
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:20,570
which you which you really care about
and it can motivate your learning and it

3434
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:20,580
and it can motivate your learning and it
 

3435
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:22,370
and it can motivate your learning and it
can be for somebody curing cancer or

3436
01:13:22,370 --> 01:13:22,380
can be for somebody curing cancer or
 

3437
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:25,520
can be for somebody curing cancer or
doing self-driving cars so whatever but

patterns and we should be doing it and
 

3445
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,100
patterns and we should be doing it and
we're still not doing it oh you can do

we're still not doing it oh you can do
 

3447
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:38,479
we're still not doing it oh you can do
it better and just start there and see

01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:38,489
it better and just start there and see
 

3449
01:13:38,489 --> 01:13:42,320
it better and just start there and see
where it can bring you so you've you've

3541
01:16:04,829 --> 01:16:07,790
important thing for me is to be true to
myself to what I think is right how long

3542
01:16:07,790 --> 01:16:07,800
myself to what I think is right how long
 

3543
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:11,419
myself to what I think is right how long
did it take how hard was it to find the

3544
01:16:11,419 --> 01:16:11,429
did it take how hard was it to find the
 

3545
01:16:11,429 --> 01:16:14,959
did it take how hard was it to find the
user you have to be true to so it takes

3546
01:16:14,959 --> 01:16:14,969
user you have to be true to so it takes
 

3547
01:16:14,969 --> 01:16:17,870
user you have to be true to so it takes
time and even now sometimes you know the

3548
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:17,880
time and even now sometimes you know the
 

3549
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:21,760
time and even now sometimes you know the
vanity and the triviality can take a MIG

3550
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:21,770
vanity and the triviality can take a MIG
 

3551
01:16:21,770 --> 01:16:25,220
vanity and the triviality can take a MIG
yeah it can everywhere it you know it's

3552
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:25,230
yeah it can everywhere it you know it's
 

3553
01:16:25,230 --> 01:16:26,990
yeah it can everywhere it you know it's
just the vanity item it is different the

3554
01:16:26,990 --> 01:16:27,000
just the vanity item it is different the
 

3555
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,430
just the vanity item it is different the
vanity in different places but we all

3556
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:28,440
vanity in different places but we all
 

3557
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:33,049
vanity in different places but we all
have our piece of vanity but I think

3558
01:16:33,049 --> 01:16:33,059
have our piece of vanity but I think
 

3559
01:16:33,059 --> 01:16:38,299
have our piece of vanity but I think
actually for me the many times the place

3560
01:16:38,299 --> 01:16:38,309
actually for me the many times the place
 

3561
01:16:38,309 --> 01:16:41,890
actually for me the many times the place
to get back to it is you know when I

3562
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:41,900
to get back to it is you know when I
 

3563
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:45,589
to get back to it is you know when I
when I'm alone and also when I read and

3564
01:16:45,589 --> 01:16:45,599
when I'm alone and also when I read and
 

3565
01:16:45,599 --> 01:16:47,810
when I'm alone and also when I read and
I think by selecting the right books you

3566
01:16:47,810 --> 01:16:47,820
I think by selecting the right books you
 

3567
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:50,930
I think by selecting the right books you
can get the right questions

3568
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:50,940
can get the right questions
 

3569
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:54,799
can get the right questions
and learn from what you read

3570
01:16:54,799 --> 01:16:54,809
and learn from what you read
 

3571
