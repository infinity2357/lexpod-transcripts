so

102
00:01:58,149 --> 00:01:58,159
so
 

103
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,389
so
as for whether it's outside

104
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:00,399
as for whether it's outside
 

105
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,510
as for whether it's outside
of the scientific method

106

of the scientific method
 

107
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,950
of the scientific method
i think there's

108
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:04,960
i think there's
 

109
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,950
i think there's
a fundamental challenge at the heart of

a fundamental challenge at the heart of
 

111
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,109
a fundamental challenge at the heart of

the science of consciousness that we
 

113
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,070
the science of consciousness that we
need to face up to which is that

need to face up to which is that
 

115
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,990
need to face up to which is that
consciousness is is not publicly

all right i can't look inside your head
 

121
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,190
all right i can't look inside your head
and see your feelings and experiences

122
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,200
and see your feelings and experiences
 

123
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,869
and see your feelings and experiences
we know about consciousness not you know

124
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:22,879
we know about consciousness not you know
 

125
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,990
we know about consciousness not you know
not from doing experiments or public

126
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,000

129
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,150
observation
we just know about it from our immediate

130
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,160
we just know about it from our immediate
 

131
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,750
we just know about it from our immediate
awareness of our feelings and

132
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:31,760
awareness of our feelings and

experiences
 

135
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,630
experiences
so it's qualitative not quantitative as

136
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,640
so it's qualitative not quantitative as
 

137
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,229
so it's qualitative not quantitative as
you talk about yeah that's another

138
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,239
you talk about yeah that's another
 

139
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,150
you talk about yeah that's another
aspect of it so there are a couple of

140
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,160
aspect of it so there are a couple of
 

141
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,390
aspect of it so there are a couple of
reasons consciousness

142
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
reasons consciousness
 

143
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,110
reasons consciousness
i think is not susceptible to the

144
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,120
i think is not susceptible to the
 

145
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,309
i think is not susceptible to the
standard or not fully susceptible to the

146
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:48,319
standard or not fully susceptible to the
 

147
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,790
standard or not fully susceptible to the
standard scientific approach one reason

148
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:50,800
standard scientific approach one reason
 

149
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,390
standard scientific approach one reason
you've just raised is that it's

150
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,400
you've just raised is that it's
 

151
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,869
you've just raised is that it's
qualitative rather than quantitative

152
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:54,879
qualitative rather than quantitative
 

153
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,869
qualitative rather than quantitative
another reason is it's not publicly

154
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:56,879
another reason is it's not publicly
 

155
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,270
another reason is it's not publicly
observable so i mean science science is

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,470
observable
but there's an important difference

170
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,480
but there's an important difference
 

171
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,550
but there's an important difference
with all these things

172
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:14,560
with all these things
 

173
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,750
with all these things
we postulate unobservables

174
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:17,760
we postulate unobservables
 

175
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,309
we postulate unobservables
in order to explain what we can observe

176
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:20,319
in order to explain what we can observe
 

177
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,790
in order to explain what we can observe
right in the whole of science

178
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:22,800
right in the whole of science
 

179
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,430
right in the whole of science
that's that's the that's how it works in

180
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:25,440
that's that's the that's how it works in
 

181
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,670
that's that's the that's how it works in
the case of consciousness

the case of consciousness
 

183
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,990
the case of consciousness
in the unique case of consciousness the

184
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,000
in the unique case of consciousness the
 

185
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,110
in the unique case of consciousness the
thing we are trying to explain

186
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,120
thing we are trying to explain
 

187
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,509
thing we are trying to explain
is not publicly observable and that is

188
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:35,519
is not publicly observable and that is
 

189
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,550
is not publicly observable and that is
utterly unique if we want to fully bring

190
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:38,560
utterly unique if we want to fully bring
 

191
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,470
utterly unique if we want to fully bring
science into consciousness we need a

192
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,480
science into consciousness we need a
 

193
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,470
science into consciousness we need a
more expansive conception of the

194
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
more expansive conception of the
 

195
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,229
more expansive conception of the
scientific method so it doesn't mean we

196
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:44,239
scientific method so it doesn't mean we
 

197
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,350
scientific method so it doesn't mean we
can't explain consciousness

198
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:45,360
can't explain consciousness
 

199
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,710
can't explain consciousness
scientifically

200
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:46,720
scientifically
 

201
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,190
scientifically
but we need to rethink what science is

202
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
but we need to rethink what science is

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,789
but we need to rethink what science is
what do you mean publicly the word

204
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:50,799
what do you mean publicly the word
 

205
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,630
what do you mean publicly the word
publicly observable is there something

206
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,640
publicly observable is there something
 

207
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,149
publicly observable is there something
interesting to be said about the word

208
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:54,159
interesting to be said about the word
 

209
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,830

publicly i suppose versus privately
yeah it's tricky to define but i suppose

212
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,200
yeah it's tricky to define but i suppose
 

213
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,830
yeah it's tricky to define but i suppose
the data of physics are available to

intelligent enough to do mathematics
 

231
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,110
intelligent enough to do mathematics
they could understand our physics they

00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,120
they could understand our physics they
 

233
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,710
they could understand our physics they
could look at the data of our

a sense it's observable as you say we

i am directly aware of my own feelings

250
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:40,639
i am directly aware of my own feelings
 

251
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,350
i am directly aware of my own feelings
and experiences if i'm in pain

252
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
and experiences if i'm in pain
 

253
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,469
and experiences if i'm in pain
it's

254
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:44,479
it's
 

255
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,390
it's
it's just right there for me my pain is

256
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,400
it's just right there for me my pain is
 

257
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,670
it's just right there for me my pain is
just totally directly evident to me

258
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
just totally directly evident to me
 

259
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,310
just totally directly evident to me
but you from the outside

260
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,320
but you from the outside
 

261
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,870
but you from the outside
cannot directly access my pain you can

262
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880
cannot directly access my pain you can
 

263
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,510
cannot directly access my pain you can
access my pain behavior

264
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,520
access my pain behavior
 

265
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,070
access my pain behavior
but or you can ask me

266
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,080
but or you can ask me
 

267
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,590
but or you can ask me
but you can't

268
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:01,600
but you can't
 

269
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,909
but you can't
access my pain in the way that i can

270
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:03,919
access my pain in the way that i can
 

271
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,150
access my pain in the way that i can
access my pain

272
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,160
access my pain
 

273
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,670
access my pain
so i think

274
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
so i think
 

275
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,510
so i think
that's a distinction

276
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:09,520
that's a distinction
 

277
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,670
that's a distinction
it might be difficult to totally pin it

278
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
it might be difficult to totally pin it
 

279
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,950
it might be difficult to totally pin it
down

280
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:12,960
down
 

281
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,550
down
how we define those things but i think

282
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:14,560
how we define those things but i think
 

283
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,310
how we define those things but i think
there's a fairly clear and very

284
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,320
there's a fairly clear and very
 

285
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,070
there's a fairly clear and very
important difference there so you think

286
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,080
important difference there so you think
 

287
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,710
important difference there so you think
there's a a kind of direct observation

288
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
there's a a kind of direct observation
 

289
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,950
there's a a kind of direct observation
that you're able to do of your pain

290
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:22,960
that you're able to do of your pain
 

291
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,070
that you're able to do of your pain
that i'm not so my observation

292
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,080
that i'm not so my observation
 

293
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,070
that i'm not so my observation
all the ways in which i can sneak up to

294
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080
all the ways in which i can sneak up to
 

295
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,029
all the ways in which i can sneak up to
observing your pain is indirect

296
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,039
observing your pain is indirect
 

297
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,029
observing your pain is indirect
versus yours is direct

298
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
versus yours is direct
 

299
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,950
versus yours is direct
can you play devil's advocate is it

300
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:34,960
can you play devil's advocate is it
 

301
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,430
can you play devil's advocate is it
possible for me to get closer and closer

302
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440
possible for me to get closer and closer
 

303
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,710
possible for me to get closer and closer
and closer

304
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:38,720
and closer
 

305
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,710
and closer
to being able to observe your pain

306
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:42,720
to being able to observe your pain
 

307
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,590
to being able to observe your pain
like all the subjective experiences

308
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:45,600
like all the subjective experiences
 

309
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,270
like all the subjective experiences
you're yours

310
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
you're yours
 

311
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,510
you're yours
in the way that you do

312
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,520
in the way that you do
 

313
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,350
in the way that you do
yeah i mean

314
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,360
yeah i mean
 

315
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,029
yeah i mean
so it's of course it's not that we

316
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
so it's of course it's not that we
 

317
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,430
so it's of course it's not that we
observe behavior and then we make an

318
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:55,440
observe behavior and then we make an
 

319
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,469
observe behavior and then we make an
inference

320
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:56,479
inference
 

321
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,629
inference
we are hardwired

322
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:58,639
we are hardwired
 

323
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,790
we are hardwired
to instinctively

324
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:00,800
to instinctively
 

325
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,430
to instinctively
interpret smiles as happiness

326
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440
interpret smiles as happiness
 

327
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,870
interpret smiles as happiness
crying as

328
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:04,880
crying as
 

329
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,189
crying as
as sadness and

as sadness and
 

331
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,870
as sadness and
as we get to know someone we find it

332
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:08,880
as we get to know someone we find it
 

333
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,510
as we get to know someone we find it
very easy to adopt their perspective get

334
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,520
very easy to adopt their perspective get
 

335
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,670
very easy to adopt their perspective get

336
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:13,680
into their shoes
 

337
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,110
into their shoes
but

338
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,120
but
 

339
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,790
but
strictly speaking

340
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
strictly speaking
 

341
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,510
strictly speaking
all we have perceptual access to

342
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
all we have perceptual access to
 

343
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,990
all we have perceptual access to
is someone's behavior and

344
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
is someone's behavior and
 

345
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,990
is someone's behavior and
if you were just strictly speaking if

346
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
if you were just strictly speaking if
 

347
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,749
if you were just strictly speaking if
you were trying to

348
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:25,759
you were trying to
 

349
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,189
you were trying to
explain

350
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:27,199
explain
 

351
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,510
explain
someone's behavior that those aspects

352
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:29,520
someone's behavior that those aspects
 

353
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,270
someone's behavior that those aspects
that are publicly observable

354
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,280
that are publicly observable
 

355
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,950
that are publicly observable
i don't think you'd ever have recourse

356
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:32,960
i don't think you'd ever have recourse
 

357
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,710
i don't think you'd ever have recourse
to attribute consciousness you could

358
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
to attribute consciousness you could
 

359
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,390
to attribute consciousness you could
just postulate some kind of mechanism if

360
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:36,400
just postulate some kind of mechanism if
 

361
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,029
just postulate some kind of mechanism if
you were just trying to explain the

362
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:39,039
you were just trying to explain the
 

363
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,830
you were just trying to explain the
behavior so someone like daniel dennett

364
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:41,840
behavior so someone like daniel dennett
 

365
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,070
behavior so someone like daniel dennett
is very consistent on this

366
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,080
is very consistent on this
 

367
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,189
is very consistent on this
so i think for most people

368
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
so i think for most people
 

369
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,990
so i think for most people
what science is in the business of

370
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,000
what science is in the business of
 

371
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,790
what science is in the business of
is

372
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:50,800
is
 

373
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,790
is
explaining

374
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:52,800
explaining
 

375
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,469
explaining
the data of public observation

376
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:54,479
the data of public observation
 

377
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,710
the data of public observation
experiment if you religiously followed

378
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:56,720
experiment if you religiously followed
 

379
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,629
experiment if you religiously followed
that

380
00:06:58,629 --> 00:06:58,639
that
 

381
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,710
that
you would not postulate consciousness

382
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,720
you would not postulate consciousness
 

383
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,390
you would not postulate consciousness
because it's it's not

384
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:02,400
because it's it's not
 

385
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,230
because it's it's not
a datum that's known about in that way

386
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240
a datum that's known about in that way
 

387
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,990
a datum that's known about in that way
and daniel dennett is really consistent

388
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,000
and daniel dennett is really consistent
 

389
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,990
and daniel dennett is really consistent
on this he thinks

390
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,000
on this he thinks
 

391
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,550
on this he thinks
my consciousness cannot be empirically

392
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,560
my consciousness cannot be empirically
 

393
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,029
my consciousness cannot be empirically
verified and therefore it doesn't exist

394
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:13,039
verified and therefore it doesn't exist
 

395
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,110
verified and therefore it doesn't exist
dennett is consistent on this i think

396
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,120
dennett is consistent on this i think
 

397
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,550
dennett is consistent on this i think
i'm consistent on this but i think a lot

398
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,560
i'm consistent on this but i think a lot
 

399
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,830
i'm consistent on this but i think a lot
of people

400
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:17,840
of people
 

401
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,230
of people
have a slightly confused

402
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,240
have a slightly confused
 

403
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,189
have a slightly confused
uh

404
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:21,199

they think um

410
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:27,440
they think um
 

411
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,270
they think um
the business of science is just to

412
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,280
the business of science is just to
 

413
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,950
the business of science is just to
account for public observation

414
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960
account for public observation
 

415
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,390

but on the other hand

418
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:34,800
but on the other hand
 

419
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,710
but on the other hand
they also believe in consciousness

420
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:36,720
they also believe in consciousness
 

421
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,670
they also believe in consciousness
without appreciating i think that

422
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:39,680
without appreciating i think that
 

423
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,550
without appreciating i think that
that implies that there is another datum

424
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:42,560
that implies that there is another datum
 

425
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,629
that implies that there is another datum
over and above the data of public

426
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:44,639
over and above the data of public
 

427
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,710
over and above the data of public
observation experiments namely just the

00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,280
we walk along this conversation you keep

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,869
we walk along this conversation you keep

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,510
opening doors i don't want to walk into

and i will but i want to try to stay
kind of focused so you mentioned daniel

438
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,280
kind of focused so you mentioned daniel
 

439
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,670
kind of focused so you mentioned daniel
dennett let's lay it out since he sticks

440
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,680
dennett let's lay it out since he sticks
 

441
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,589
dennett let's lay it out since he sticks
to his story

442
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:01,599
to his story
 

443
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,550
to his story
upon unintended and then you stick to

444
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:04,560
upon unintended and then you stick to
 

445
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,110
upon unintended and then you stick to
yours what is your story what is your

446
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,120
yours what is your story what is your
 

447
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,350
yours what is your story what is your
theory of consciousness versus his can

448
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:09,360
theory of consciousness versus his can
 

449
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,869
theory of consciousness versus his can
you clarify his position

450
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:12,879
you clarify his position
 

451
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,150
you clarify his position
so

452
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,160
so
 

453
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,150
so
my view i defend the view known as pan

454
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,160
my view i defend the view known as pan
 

455
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,110
my view i defend the view known as pan
psychism which is the view that

456
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,120
psychism which is the view that
 

457
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,390
psychism which is the view that
consciousness

458
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
consciousness
 

459
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,629
consciousness
is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature

460
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:22,639
is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature
 

461
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,710
is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature
of the physical world

of the physical world
 

463
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,029
of the physical world
so it doesn't literally mean that

464
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:27,039
so it doesn't literally mean that
 

465
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,430
so it doesn't literally mean that
everything is conscious despite

466
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:29,440
everything is conscious despite
 

467
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,909
everything is conscious despite
the meaning of the word pan everything

the meaning of the word pan everything
 

469
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,469
the meaning of the word pan everything
psyche mind so literally that means

470
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:34,479
psyche mind so literally that means
 

471
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,230
psyche mind so literally that means
everything has mind

472
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,240
everything has mind
 

473
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,269
everything has mind
but

474
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:37,279
but
 

475
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,509
but
the typical commitment of the panzykist

476
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:39,519
the typical commitment of the panzykist
 

477
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,630
the typical commitment of the panzykist
is that

478
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:40,640
is that
 

479
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,709
is that
the fundamental building blocks of

the fundamental building blocks of

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,389
the fundamental building blocks of
reality

reality
 

483
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,470
reality
maybe fundamental particles like

484
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:46,480
maybe fundamental particles like
 

485
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,389
maybe fundamental particles like
electrons and quarks

486
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:48,399
electrons and quarks
 

487
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,430
electrons and quarks
have

488
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:49,440
have
 

489
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,870
have
incredibly simple forms of experience

490
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:52,880
incredibly simple forms of experience
 

491
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,590
incredibly simple forms of experience
and that the very complex experience of

492
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:55,600
and that the very complex experience of
 

493
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,750
and that the very complex experience of
the human or animal brain

494
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,760
the human or animal brain
 

495
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,190
the human or animal brain
is somehow rooted in or derived from

496
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,200
is somehow rooted in or derived from
 

497
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,190
is somehow rooted in or derived from
this much more simple consciousness at

498
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,200
this much more simple consciousness at
 

499
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,829
this much more simple consciousness at
the level of fundamental physics

500
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:06,839

 

501
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,750

so i mean that's that's a theory that i

502
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,760
so i mean that's that's a theory that i
 

503
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,550
so i mean that's that's a theory that i
would justify on the grounds that it can

504
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:12,560
would justify on the grounds that it can
 

505
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,230
would justify on the grounds that it can

there's sort of no fact of the matter

about which of these drafts is the
correct one

correct one
 

651
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,630
correct one
on roloff's view maybe there's no fact

652
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:46,640
on roloff's view maybe there's no fact
 

653

on roloff's view maybe there's no fact

drafts is my consciousness
 

657
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,069

but
 

659

those analytic philosophers are
 

703
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,389
those analytic philosophers are
sticklers for terminology it's very fun

if you just start and then defining
words right yeah i think starting with

words right yeah i think starting with
 

713
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,389

when he first was thinking about
 

719
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,110

and he decided that the problem with the
 

727
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,550
and he decided that the problem with the
continental philosophy if it was really

00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:02,560
continental philosophy if it was really
 

729

it was just

734
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:07,519
it was just
 

735
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,670
it was just
not about anything important and he

736
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:09,680
not about anything important and he
 

737
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,990
not about anything important and he
thought there was more chance of working

738
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,000
thought there was more chance of working
 

739
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,389
thought there was more chance of working
within analytic philosophy and asking

740
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:14,399
within analytic philosophy and asking
 

741
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,230
within analytic philosophy and asking
some more meaningful some more profound

742
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,240
some more meaningful some more profound
 

743
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,069
some more meaningful some more profound

continental philosophy and making it
 

747
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,509
continental philosophy and making it
more rigorous now they're both horrific

748
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
more rigorous now they're both horrific
 

749

i think just a tiny tangent on
 

759
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,150
i think just a tiny tangent on

terminology
 

761
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,790
terminology
i do think that there's uh

762
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:34,800
i do think that there's uh
 

763
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,430
i do think that there's uh
a lot of deep insight to be discovered

764
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:37,440
a lot of deep insight to be discovered

deep philosophical questions about what
 

791
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,069
deep philosophical questions about what
is an algorithm these basic questions

is an algorithm these basic questions
 

793
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,389
is an algorithm these basic questions
and they sound very simple but they're

794

like
 

803
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,710
like
you know what is intelligence

804
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:20,720
you know what is intelligence
 

805
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,470
you know what is intelligence
and just continually asking that

806
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:22,480
and just continually asking that
 

807
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,910
and just continually asking that
question over and over

intelligence computer science space it's
 

819
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,670
intelligence computer science space it's
actually very useful at the same time

820
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:33,680
actually very useful at the same time
 

821
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,750
actually very useful at the same time
you know it should start a terminology

you know it should start a terminology
 

823
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,069
you know it should start a terminology

and then progress where you kind of say
 

825
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,310

he said it's like hey man did you do the

836
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:51,279
he said it's like hey man did you do the
 

837
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,310
he said it's like hey man did you do the
sex stuff or not

838
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:54,320
sex stuff or not
 

839
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,189
sex stuff or not
yeah

840
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:55,199
yeah
 

841
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:55,990
yeah
so

842
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,000
so
 

843
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,670
so
there's you have to both be able to talk

844
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:57,680
there's you have to both be able to talk
 

845
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,550
there's you have to both be able to talk
about

846
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:58,560
about
 

847
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,629
about
the sex stuff and the meaning of the

848
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:00,639
the sex stuff and the meaning of the
 

849
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,230
the sex stuff and the meaning of the
word is with consciousness because we

850
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,240
word is with consciousness because we
 

851
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,629
word is with consciousness because we
don't currently understand you know

852
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:06,639
don't currently understand you know
 

853
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,310
don't currently understand you know
very much

854
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:08,320
very much
 

855
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,150
very much
terminology discussions are very

856
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,160
terminology discussions are very
 

857
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,670
terminology discussions are very
important because

858
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:11,680
important because
 

859
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,150
important because

either deeply unique or

it's just on the question of terminology

910
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:10,560
it's just on the question of terminology
 

911
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,230
it's just on the question of terminology
before right um

912
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,240
before right um
 

913
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,870

yes i think it used to be

914
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:14,880
yes i think it used to be
 

915
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,110
yes i think it used to be
the fashion among philosophers that we

916
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,120
the fashion among philosophers that we
 

917
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,910
the fashion among philosophers that we
had to come up with utterly precise

918
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:19,920
had to come up with utterly precise
 

919
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,910
had to come up with utterly precise
necessary and sufficient conditions for

920
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:21,920
necessary and sufficient conditions for
 

921
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,110
necessary and sufficient conditions for
each word

922
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,120
each word
 

923
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,590
each word
and then i think i think this has gone

924
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:25,600
and then i think i think this has gone
 

925
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,430
and then i think i think this has gone
out of fashion a bit partly because it's

926
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:27,440
out of fashion a bit partly because it's
 

927
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,790
out of fashion a bit partly because it's
just been

928
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:28,800
just been
 

929
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,790
just been
you know such a failure

930
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:30,800
you know such a failure
 

931
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,550
you know such a failure
the word knowledge in particular people

932
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:32,560
the word knowledge in particular people
 

933
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,389
the word knowledge in particular people
used to define knowledge as true

934
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:34,399
used to define knowledge as true
 

935
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,629
used to define knowledge as true
justified belief and then this guy

936
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:36,639
justified belief and then this guy
 

937
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,590
justified belief and then this guy
gettier had this very short paper where

938
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:39,600
gettier had this very short paper where
 

939
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,350
gettier had this very short paper where
he just produced some pretty conclusive

940
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:41,360
he just produced some pretty conclusive
 

941
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,110
he just produced some pretty conclusive
counter examples to that i think you

942
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,120
counter examples to that i think you
 

943
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,030
counter examples to that i think you
know he wrote very few papers but this

944
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,040
know he wrote very few papers but this
 

945
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,110
know he wrote very few papers but this
is just you know you have to teach this

946
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:47,120
is just you know you have to teach this
 

947
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,710
is just you know you have to teach this
on a on an undergraduate philosophy

948
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:48,720
on a on an undergraduate philosophy
 

949
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,790
on a on an undergraduate philosophy
course and then after that

950
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:50,800
course and then after that
 

951
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,870
course and then after that
you had a huge literature of people

952
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:52,880
you had a huge literature of people
 

953
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,990
you had a huge literature of people
trying to

954
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,000
trying to
 

955
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,509
trying to
address this and propose a new

956
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:55,519
address this and propose a new
 

957
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,030
address this and propose a new
definition but then someone else would

958
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,040
definition but then someone else would
 

959
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,710
definition but then someone else would
come out with counter examples and then

960
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:58,720
come out with counter examples and then
 

961
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,310
come out with counter examples and then
you get a new definition of knowledge

962
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:00,320
you get a new definition of knowledge
 

963
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,749
you get a new definition of knowledge
and counter examples and it just went on

964
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:01,759
and counter examples and it just went on
 

965
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,350
and counter examples and it just went on
and on and never seemed to get anywhere

966
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,360
and on and never seemed to get anywhere
 

967
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,669
and on and never seemed to get anywhere
so i think the thought now is

968
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:05,679
so i think the thought now is
 

969
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,309
so i think the thought now is
let's work out how precise we need to be

970
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:08,319
let's work out how precise we need to be
 

971
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,230
let's work out how precise we need to be
for what we're trying to do and i think

972
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:10,240
for what we're trying to do and i think
 

973
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,909
for what we're trying to do and i think
that's a healthier attitude so precision

974
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:11,919
that's a healthier attitude so precision
 

975
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,590
that's a healthier attitude so precision
is important but you just need to work

976
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:13,600
is important but you just need to work
 

977
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,990
is important but you just need to work
out how precise do we need to be for

978
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,000
out how precise do we need to be for
 

979
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,069
out how precise do we need to be for
these purposes

980
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:18,079
these purposes
 

981
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,309
these purposes
coming to dennett and narrative theories

982
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:20,319
coming to dennett and narrative theories
 

983
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,630
coming to dennett and narrative theories
i mean i think

984
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:22,640
i mean i think
 

985
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,150
i mean i think
i i think narrative theories are

986
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,160
i i think narrative theories are
 

987
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,789
i i think narrative theories are
a plausible contender for a theory of

00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:28,799
a plausible contender for a theory of

the same person in some sense today as i
 

997
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,950
the same person in some sense today as i
was

cross consciousness and it's yeah i
 

1047
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,029
cross consciousness and it's yeah i
don't know why that's coming probably

there is a great continuity between

there is a great continuity between
 

1139
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,909
there is a great continuity between
humans and the rest of the universe

1140
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:15,919
humans and the rest of the universe
 

1141
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,190
humans and the rest of the universe
there's nothing

1142
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:17,200
there's nothing
 

1143
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,190
there's nothing
that special about human consciousness

1144
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:19,200
that special about human consciousness
 

1145
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,750
that special about human consciousness
it's just a highly evolved form

1146
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:21,760
it's just a highly evolved form
 

1147
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,710
it's just a highly evolved form
of what exists throughout the universe

of what exists throughout the universe
 

1149
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,710
of what exists throughout the universe
so so we're very much continuous with

00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:26,720
so so we're very much continuous with
 

1151
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,669
so so we're very much continuous with
the rest of the physical universe what

the rest of the physical universe what
 

1153
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,710
the rest of the physical universe what
is unique about human beings i suppose

1154
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:32,720
is unique about human beings i suppose
 

1155
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,549
is unique about human beings i suppose

get to kind of uh
play

1486
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,120
play
 

1487
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,750
play
in the little illusion that all of this

1488
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:31,760
in the little illusion that all of this
 

1489
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,750
in the little illusion that all of this
has deep meaning

1490
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:33,760
has deep meaning
 

1491
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,630
has deep meaning
that's pleasure yeah well

1492
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:36,640
that's pleasure yeah well
 

1493
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,470
that's pleasure yeah well
but i mean you know people

1494
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:38,480
but i mean you know people
 

1495
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,990
but i mean you know people
sacrifice their lives uh atheists may

1496
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:42,000
sacrifice their lives uh atheists may
 

1497
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,470
sacrifice their lives uh atheists may
sacrifice their lives for the sake of

1498
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:44,480
sacrifice their lives for the sake of
 

1499
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,070
sacrifice their lives for the sake of
someone else or for the sake of

1500
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:46,080
someone else or for the sake of
 

1501
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,310
someone else or for the sake of
something important enough and

1502
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:48,320
something important enough and
 

1503
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,350
something important enough and
clearly in that case they're not um

1504
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:51,360
clearly in that case they're not um
 

1505
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,789
clearly in that case they're not um
doing it for the sake of their own

1506
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:52,799
doing it for the sake of their own
 

1507
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,230
doing it for the sake of their own
pleasure that's a rather dramatic

1508
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:54,240
pleasure that's a rather dramatic
 

1509
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,909
pleasure that's a rather dramatic
example but they can be just trivial

1510
00:26:55,909 --> 00:26:55,919
example but they can be just trivial
 

1511
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,350
example but they can be just trivial
examples where

1512
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,360
examples where
 

1513
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,310
examples where
um

1514
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:58,320
um
 

1515
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,390
um
you know i i choose to

1516
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:00,400
you know i i choose to
 

1517
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,710
you know i i choose to
be honest rather than um

1518
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:02,720
be honest rather than um
 

1519
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,430
be honest rather than um
lie about something can i lose out a bit

1520
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:05,440
lie about something can i lose out a bit
 

1521
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,310
lie about something can i lose out a bit
and i um i have a bit less pleasure but

1522
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:08,320
and i um i have a bit less pleasure but
 

1523
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,590
and i um i have a bit less pleasure but
i thought it was worth doing the honest

1524
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:09,600
i thought it was worth doing the honest
 

1525
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,029
i thought it was worth doing the honest
thing or something i mean i just think

1526
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:11,039
thing or something i mean i just think
 

1527
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,149
thing or something i mean i just think
so that's a

1528
00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:12,159
so that's a
 

1529
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,350
so that's a
i mean maybe you can use the word

1530
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:13,360
i mean maybe you can use the word
 

1531
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,190
i mean maybe you can use the word
pleasure so broadly that you're just

1532
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:15,200
pleasure so broadly that you're just
 

1533
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,590
pleasure so broadly that you're just
essentially meaning something worthwhile

1534
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:17,600
essentially meaning something worthwhile
 

1535
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,110
essentially meaning something worthwhile
but then

1536
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,120
but then
 

1537
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,630
but then
i think the word pleasure maybe maybe

1538
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:20,640
i think the word pleasure maybe maybe
 

1539
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,310
i think the word pleasure maybe maybe
loses its meaning

1540
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:22,320
loses its meaning
 

1541
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,149
loses its meaning
sure wow

1542
00:27:24,149 --> 00:27:24,159
sure wow
 

1543
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,190
sure wow
but what do you think about the blades

1544
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:25,200
but what do you think about the blades
 

1545
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,070
but what do you think about the blades
of grass case what do you think about

1546
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,080
of grass case what do you think about
 

1547
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,230
of grass case what do you think about
someone who spends their life counting

1548
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:28,240
someone who spends their life counting
 

1549
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,149
someone who spends their life counting
blades of grass and doesn't enjoy it

1550
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:30,159
blades of grass and doesn't enjoy it
 

1551
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,070
blades of grass and doesn't enjoy it
so i think i personally think it's

1552
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:32,080
so i think i personally think it's
 

1553
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,310
so i think i personally think it's
impossible or maybe i'm not

1554
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:34,320
impossible or maybe i'm not
 

1555
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,230
impossible or maybe i'm not
understanding

1556
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:36,240
understanding
 

1557
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,230
understanding
even like the philosophical formulation

1558
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:38,240
even like the philosophical formulation
 

1559
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,590
even like the philosophical formulation
but i think it's impossible to have a

1560
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:39,600
but i think it's impossible to have a
 

1561
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,549
but i think it's impossible to have a
goal and not draw pleasure from it

1562
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:42,559
goal and not draw pleasure from it
 

1563
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,149
goal and not draw pleasure from it
make it worthwhile forget the word

1564
00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:44,159
make it worthwhile forget the word
 

1565
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,269
make it worthwhile forget the word
pleasure

1566
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:45,279
pleasure
 

1567
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,230
pleasure
i think

1568
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:46,240
i think
 

1569
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,029
i think
the word gold loses meaning if i say i'm

1570
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:49,039
the word gold loses meaning if i say i'm
 

1571
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,470
the word gold loses meaning if i say i'm
going to count the number of pens on

1572
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:50,480
going to count the number of pens on
 

1573
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,830
going to count the number of pens on
this table

1574
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:51,840
this table
 

1575
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,630
this table
if i'm actively involved in the task i

1576
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:54,640
if i'm actively involved in the task i
 

1577
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,389
if i'm actively involved in the task i
will find

1578
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:56,399
will find
 

1579
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,190
will find
joy in it i will find out like i think

1580
00:27:59,190 --> 00:27:59,200
joy in it i will find out like i think
 

1581
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,470
joy in it i will find out like i think
there's a lot of meaning and joy to be

1582
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:02,480
there's a lot of meaning and joy to be
 

1583
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,190
there's a lot of meaning and joy to be
discovered in the uh

1584
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:05,200
discovered in the uh
 

1585
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,149
discovered in the uh
in the skill of a task in mastering of a

1586
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:08,159
in the skill of a task in mastering of a
 

1587
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,110
in the skill of a task in mastering of a
skill

1588

skill
and and taking pride in and doing it

1590
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,000
and and taking pride in and doing it
 

1591
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,070
and and taking pride in and doing it
well i mean that's

1592
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,080
well i mean that's
 

1593
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,430
well i mean that's
i don't know what it is about the human

1594
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:15,440
i don't know what it is about the human
 

1595
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,430
i don't know what it is about the human
mind but there's there's some

1596
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:17,440
mind but there's there's some
 

1597
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,870
mind but there's there's some
um

1598
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:18,880
um
 

1599
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,710
um
joy to be discovered in the mastery of a

1600
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:20,720
joy to be discovered in the mastery of a
 

1601
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,590
joy to be discovered in the mastery of a

skill
 

1603
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,430
skill
so i think it's just impossible to count

1604
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:23,440
so i think it's just impossible to count
 

1605
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,070
so i think it's just impossible to count
blades of grass and not sort of have the

1606
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,080
blades of grass and not sort of have the

giro dreams of sushi
 

1609
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,470
giro dreams of sushi
uh compelling like draws you into the

1610
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:30,480
uh compelling like draws you into the
 

1611
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,190
uh compelling like draws you into the
mastery of the simple task

1612
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:33,200
mastery of the simple task
 

1613
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,950
mastery of the simple task
um

1614
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:34,960
um
 

1615
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,630
um
yeah i suppose i mean

1616
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:38,640
yeah i suppose i mean
 

1617
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,389
yeah i suppose i mean
in a way you might think it's it's it's

1618
00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:40,399
in a way you might think it's it's it's
 

1619
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,590
in a way you might think it's it's it's
just hard to imagine someone who would

1620
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:43,600
just hard to imagine someone who would
 

1621
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,669
just hard to imagine someone who would
spend their lives doing that but then

1622
00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:45,679
spend their lives doing that but then
 

1623
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,510
spend their lives doing that but then
maybe that's just because it's so

1624
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:47,520
maybe that's just because it's so
 

1625
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,549
maybe that's just because it's so
evident

1626
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:48,559
evident
 

1627
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,310
evident
that that is a pointless task whereas

1628
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:52,320
that that is a pointless task whereas
 

1629
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,110
that that is a pointless task whereas
if we take this david humebu seriously

1630
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:55,120
if we take this david humebu seriously
 

1631
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,110
if we take this david humebu seriously
it ought to be you know a totally

1632
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,120
it ought to be you know a totally
 

1633
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,909
it ought to be you know a totally
possible life goal whereas i mean i

1634
00:28:59,909 --> 00:28:59,919
possible life goal whereas i mean i
 

1635
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,549
possible life goal whereas i mean i
yeah i guess i just find it hard to

1636
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:02,559
yeah i guess i just find it hard to
 

1637
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,789
yeah i guess i just find it hard to
shake the idea that

1638
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:04,799
shake the idea that
 

1639
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,789
shake the idea that
some ways of

1640
00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:06,799
some ways of
 

1641
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,909
some ways of
um some life goals are more worthwhile

1642
00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:09,919
um some life goals are more worthwhile
 

1643
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,510
um some life goals are more worthwhile
than others and it doesn't mean you know

1644
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:11,520
than others and it doesn't mean you know
 

1645
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,269
than others and it doesn't mean you know
that there's a one single way you should

1646
00:29:13,269 --> 00:29:13,279

it's worth doing and
um it's hard to make sense of

1684
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:51,600
um it's hard to make sense of
 

1685
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,110
um it's hard to make sense of
metaphysically what could possibly

metaphysically what could possibly
 

1687
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,310
metaphysically what could possibly
ground that how could we know about

1688
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:54,320
ground that how could we know about
 

1689
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,029
ground that how could we know about
these facts but

1690
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:57,039
these facts but
 

1691
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,549
these facts but
that's the starting point for me i don't

1692
00:29:58,549 --> 00:29:58,559
that's the starting point for me i don't
 

1693

that's the starting point for me i don't
know i think you walking

2071
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,790
cut it
but

2072
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:40,800
but
 

2073
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,550
but
if

2074
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:42,560
if

picture of reality then maybe a

2080
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:48,960
picture of reality then maybe a
 

2081
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,030
picture of reality then maybe a
panzerkiss view is is more consonant

2082
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:51,040
panzerkiss view is is more consonant
 

2083
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,270
panzerkiss view is is more consonant
with that so if you

2084
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:53,280
with that so if you
 

2085
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,750
with that so if you
if you have a mystical experience where

2086
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:55,760
if you have a mystical experience where
 

2087
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,589
if you have a mystical experience where
you um

2088
00:36:57,589 --> 00:36:57,599
you um
 

2089
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,589
you um
it seems to you in this experience that

2090
00:36:59,589 --> 00:36:59,599
it seems to you in this experience that
 

2091

it seems to you in this experience that
there is this

2092
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:02,240
there is this
 

2093
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,069
there is this
higher form of consciousness at the root

2094
00:37:04,069 --> 00:37:04,079
higher form of consciousness at the root
 

2095
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,589

if you're a materialist you've got to
 

2099
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,710
if you're a materialist you've got to
think that's a delusion you know there's

2100
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:08,720
think that's a delusion you know there's
 

2101
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,310
think that's a delusion you know there's
just something in your brain making you

2102
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:10,320
just something in your brain making you
 

2103
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,150
just something in your brain making you

think that it's not real
 

2105
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,069

but if you're a pan psychist and you
 

2107

the fundamental nature of reality is

the fundamental nature of reality is

constituted of consciousness it's not
 

2113
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,790

that much of a leap to think that

that is universal so this is sometimes

2136
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:48,320
that is universal so this is sometimes
 

2137
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,470
that is universal so this is sometimes
called universal consciousness

2138
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:50,480
called universal consciousness
 

2139
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,349
called universal consciousness
so

2140
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:51,359
so
 

2141
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,190
so
on this view

2142
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:53,200
on this view
 

2143
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,829
on this view
your mind and my mind are not

2144
00:37:55,829 --> 00:37:55,839
your mind and my mind are not
 

2145
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,910
your mind and my mind are not
uh totally distinct

2146
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:57,920
uh totally distinct
 

2147
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,990
uh totally distinct
uh each of our individual conscious

2148
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:00,000
uh each of our individual conscious
 

2149
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,390
uh each of our individual conscious
minds is built upon the foundations of

2150
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:02,400
minds is built upon the foundations of
 

2151
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,470
minds is built upon the foundations of
universal consciousness and universal

2152
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:04,480
universal consciousness and universal
 

2153
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,950
universal consciousness and universal
consciousness as it exists in me is

2154
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:06,960
consciousness as it exists in me is
 

2155
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,870
consciousness as it exists in me is
one and the same thing as universal

2156
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:08,880
one and the same thing as universal
 

2157
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,150
one and the same thing as universal
consciousness as it exists in you

2158
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:12,160
consciousness as it exists in you
 

2159
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,030
consciousness as it exists in you
so

2160
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:13,040
so
 

2161
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,829
so
i've never had one of these experiences

2162
00:38:16,829 --> 00:38:16,839

 

2163
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,990

but if one is a pancychist i think one

2164
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:20,000
but if one is a pancychist i think one
 

2165
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,750
but if one is a pancychist i think one
is more open to that possibility i don't

2166
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:21,760
is more open to that possibility i don't
 

2167
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,630
is more open to that possibility i don't
see why it shouldn't be the case that

2168
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:24,640
see why it shouldn't be the case that
 

2169
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,550
see why it shouldn't be the case that
that is part of the nature of

2170
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:26,560
that is part of the nature of
 

2171
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,910
that is part of the nature of
consciousness and maybe something that

2172
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:27,920
consciousness and maybe something that
 

2173
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,750
consciousness and maybe something that
is apparent in certain

2174
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:29,760
is apparent in certain
 

2175
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,829
is apparent in certain
deep states of meditation and so what i

2176
00:38:31,829 --> 00:38:31,839
deep states of meditation and so what i
 

2177
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,829
deep states of meditation and so what i
explore in the experimental final

2178
00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:33,839
explore in the experimental final
 

2179
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,470
explore in the experimental final
chapter of my book is that could allow

2180
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:36,480
chapter of my book is that could allow
 

2181
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,190
chapter of my book is that could allow
for

2182
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:37,200
for
 

2183
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,670
for
a kind of impersonal

2184
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:39,680
a kind of impersonal
 

2185
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,470
a kind of impersonal
life after death because if that view is

2186
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:42,480
life after death because if that view is
 

2187
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,030
life after death because if that view is
true then even when the

2188
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:45,040
true then even when the
 

2189
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,550
true then even when the
particular

2190
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:46,560
particular
 

2191
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,870
particular
aspects of my conscious experience fall

2192
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:48,880
aspects of my conscious experience fall
 

2193
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,990
aspects of my conscious experience fall
away

2194
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:50,000
away
 

2195
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,430
away
that

2196
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:51,440
that
 

2197
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,190
that
element of universal consciousness at

2198
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:53,200
element of universal consciousness at
 

2199
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,589
element of universal consciousness at
the core of my identity would continue

2200
00:38:55,589 --> 00:38:55,599
the core of my identity would continue
 

2201
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,870
the core of my identity would continue
to exist

2202
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:56,880
to exist
 

2203
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,710
to exist
so i'd sort of be as it were absorbed

2204
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:58,720
so i'd sort of be as it were absorbed
 

2205
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,750
so i'd sort of be as it were absorbed
into universal consciousness so i mean

2206
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:01,760
into universal consciousness so i mean
 

2207
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,030
into universal consciousness so i mean
buddhists and hindu mystics

2208
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:05,040
buddhists and hindu mystics
 

2209
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,630
buddhists and hindu mystics
try to meditate to get rid of all the

2210
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:06,640
try to meditate to get rid of all the
 

2211
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,349
try to meditate to get rid of all the
bad karma to

2212
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:09,359
bad karma to
 

2213
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,829
bad karma to
be absorbed into universal consciousness

2214
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:11,839
be absorbed into universal consciousness
 

2215
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:13,750
be absorbed into universal consciousness
it could be that

2216
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:13,760
it could be that
 

2217
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,510
it could be that
if uh if there's no karma if there's no

2218
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:15,520
if uh if there's no karma if there's no
 

2219
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,030
if uh if there's no karma if there's no
reverb maybe everyone gets enlightened

2220
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:17,040
reverb maybe everyone gets enlightened
 

2221
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,829
reverb maybe everyone gets enlightened
when they die maybe you uh just

2222
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:19,839
when they die maybe you uh just
 

2223
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,230
when they die maybe you uh just
sink back into universal consciousness

2224
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:22,240
sink back into universal consciousness
 

2225
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,190
sink back into universal consciousness
so i i also coming back to morality

2226
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:25,200
so i i also coming back to morality
 

2227
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,230
so i i also coming back to morality
suggests this could provide some kind of

2228
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:28,240
suggests this could provide some kind of
 

2229
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,829
suggests this could provide some kind of
basis for

2230
00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:29,839
basis for
 

2231
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,190
basis for
altruism or non-egotism because if you

2232
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:33,200
altruism or non-egotism because if you
 

2233
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,230
altruism or non-egotism because if you
think

2234
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:34,240
think
 

2235
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,829
think
egotism implicitly assumes that we are

2236
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:37,839
egotism implicitly assumes that we are
 

2237
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,710
egotism implicitly assumes that we are
utterly distinct individuals whereas on

2238
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:40,720
utterly distinct individuals whereas on
 

2239
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,150
utterly distinct individuals whereas on
this view we we're not we overlap to an

2240
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:44,160
this view we we're not we overlap to an
 

2241
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,670
this view we we're not we overlap to an
extent that something at the core of our

2242
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:45,680
extent that something at the core of our
 

2243
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,790
extent that something at the core of our
being is even in this life we overlap

2244
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:48,800
being is even in this life we overlap
 

2245
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,190
being is even in this life we overlap
that would be this view that

2246
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:51,200
that would be this view that
 

2247
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,030
that would be this view that
some experienced meditators claim

2248
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:53,040
some experienced meditators claim
 

2249
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,950
some experienced meditators claim
becomes apparent to them that there is

2250
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:54,960
becomes apparent to them that there is
 

2251
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,630
becomes apparent to them that there is
something at the core of my identity

2252
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:58,640
something at the core of my identity
 

2253
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,710
something at the core of my identity
that is one and the same as

2254
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:00,720
that is one and the same as
 

2255
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,190
that is one and the same as
the thing at the core of your identity

2256
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:03,200
the thing at the core of your identity
 

2257
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,670
the thing at the core of your identity
uh this universal consciousness

2258
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:05,680
uh this universal consciousness
 

2259
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,630
uh this universal consciousness
yeah there is something very

2260
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:08,640
yeah there is something very
 

2261
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,710
yeah there is something very
like you and i in this conversation

2262
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:10,720
like you and i in this conversation
 

2263
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,950
like you and i in this conversation
there's a few people listening to this

2264
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:12,960
there's a few people listening to this
 

2265
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,069
there's a few people listening to this
all of us are in a kind of

2266
00:40:16,069 --> 00:40:16,079
all of us are in a kind of
 

2267
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,790
all of us are in a kind of
single mind together

2268
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:18,800
single mind together
 

2269
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,270
single mind together
there's some small aspect of that

2270
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:21,280
there's some small aspect of that
 

2271
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,069
there's some small aspect of that
and

2272
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:22,079
and
 

2273
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,750
and
or maybe a big aspect about us humans

2274
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:25,760
or maybe a big aspect about us humans
 

2275
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,589
or maybe a big aspect about us humans
so certainly in the space of ideas we

2276
00:40:27,589 --> 00:40:27,599
so certainly in the space of ideas we
 

2277
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,430
so certainly in the space of ideas we
kind of um

2278
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:29,440
kind of um
 

2279
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,030
kind of um
meld together

2280
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:31,040
meld together
 

2281
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,829
meld together
for time at least in a conversation

2282
00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:33,839
for time at least in a conversation
 

2283
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,829
for time at least in a conversation
and kind of play with that idea and then

2284
00:40:35,829 --> 00:40:35,839
and kind of play with that idea and then
 

2285
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:38,150
and kind of play with that idea and then
we're clearly all thinking like if i say

2286
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:38,160
we're clearly all thinking like if i say
 

2287
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,510
we're clearly all thinking like if i say
pink elephant

2288
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:39,520
pink elephant
 

2289
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,790
pink elephant
there's going to be a few people that

2290
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:40,800
there's going to be a few people that
 

2291
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,790
there's going to be a few people that
are now visualizing a pink elephant

2292
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:42,800
are now visualizing a pink elephant
 

2293
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,150
are now visualizing a pink elephant
we're all thinking

2294
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:44,160
we're all thinking
 

2295
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,230
we're all thinking
about that pink elephant together

2296
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:46,240
about that pink elephant together
 

2297
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,829
about that pink elephant together
we're all in the room together thinking

2298
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:47,839
we're all in the room together thinking
 

2299

rotating it um like you know in our
 

2303
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,470
rotating it um like you know in our
minds together what is that

2304
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:56,480
minds together what is that
 

2305
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,150
minds together what is that
that pink out does that

2306
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:58,160
that pink out does that
 

2307
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,150
that pink out does that
is there a different instantiation of

2308
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:00,160
is there a different instantiation of
 

2309
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,990
is there a different instantiation of
that pink elephant in everybody's mind

2310
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:02,000
that pink elephant in everybody's mind
 

2311
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,990
that pink elephant in everybody's mind
or is it the same elephant and we have

2312
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:04,000
or is it the same elephant and we have
 

2313
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,230
or is it the same elephant and we have
the same mind exploring that elephant

2314
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:06,240
the same mind exploring that elephant
 

2315
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,710
the same mind exploring that elephant
now if we in our mind start petting that

2316
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:08,720
now if we in our mind start petting that
 

2317
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,710
now if we in our mind start petting that
elephant like touching it that

2318
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:10,720
elephant like touching it that
 

2319
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,630
elephant like touching it that
experience that we're now like thinking

2320
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:12,640
experience that we're now like thinking
 

2321
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,390
experience that we're now like thinking
what that would feel like

2322
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:14,400
what that would feel like
 

2323
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,910
what that would feel like
what's that is that all of us

2324
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:15,920
what's that is that all of us
 

2325
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,750
what's that is that all of us
experiencing that together or is that

2326
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:17,760
experiencing that together or is that
 

2327
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,069
experiencing that together or is that
separate so like there's some aspect of

2328
00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:20,079
separate so like there's some aspect of
 

2329
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,910
separate so like there's some aspect of
the togetherness that almost seems

2330
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:21,920
the togetherness that almost seems
 

2331
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,390
the togetherness that almost seems
fundamental to civilization to society

2332
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:24,400
fundamental to civilization to society
 

2333
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,150
fundamental to civilization to society
hopefully that's not too strong but to

2334
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:26,160
hopefully that's not too strong but to
 

2335
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,309
hopefully that's not too strong but to
like some of the

2336
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:28,319
like some of the
 

2337
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,510
like some of the
fundamental properties of the human mind

2338
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:31,520
fundamental properties of the human mind
 

2339
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,349
fundamental properties of the human mind
it feels like the social aspect is

2340
00:41:33,349 --> 00:41:33,359
it feels like the social aspect is
 

2341
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:34,790
it feels like the social aspect is
really important

2342
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:34,800
really important
 

2343
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,190
really important
we call it social because we think of us

2344
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:37,200
we call it social because we think of us
 

2345
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,150
we call it social because we think of us
as individual minds interacting but if

2346
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:40,160
as individual minds interacting but if
 

2347
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,630
as individual minds interacting but if
we're just like one collective mind

2348
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:42,640
we're just like one collective mind
 

2349
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,030
we're just like one collective mind
with like fingertips they're like

2350
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:45,040
with like fingertips they're like
 

2351
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,430
with like fingertips they're like
touching each other as it's trying to

2352
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:47,440
touching each other as it's trying to
 

2353
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,190
touching each other as it's trying to
explore the elephant

2354
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:49,200
explore the elephant
 

2355
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,109
explore the elephant
but that could be just in the realm of

2356
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:51,119
but that could be just in the realm of
 

2357
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,270
but that could be just in the realm of
ideas and intelligence and not in the

2358
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:53,280
ideas and intelligence and not in the
 

2359
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,109
ideas and intelligence and not in the
realm of consciousness and it's

2360
00:41:55,109 --> 00:41:55,119
realm of consciousness and it's
 

2361
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,870
realm of consciousness and it's
interesting to see maybe it is in the

2362
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:56,880
interesting to see maybe it is in the
 

2363
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,510
interesting to see maybe it is in the
realm of consciousness yeah so

2364
00:41:59,510 --> 00:41:59,520
realm of consciousness yeah so
 

2365
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,190
realm of consciousness yeah so
it's obviously certainly true in some

2366
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:01,200
it's obviously certainly true in some
 

2367
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,550
it's obviously certainly true in some
sense

2368
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:02,560
sense
 

2369
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,470
sense
that there are these phenomena that

2370
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:04,480
that there are these phenomena that
 

2371
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,309
that there are these phenomena that
you're talking about of

2372
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:06,319
you're talking about of
 

2373
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:07,990
you're talking about of
collective consciousness in some sense i

2374
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:08,000
collective consciousness in some sense i
 

2375
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,309
collective consciousness in some sense i
suppose the question is

2376
00:42:10,309 --> 00:42:10,319
suppose the question is
 

2377
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,589
suppose the question is
how

2378
00:42:11,589 --> 00:42:11,599
how
 

2379
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,510
how
ontologically serious do we want to be

2380
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:13,520
ontologically serious do we want to be
 

2381
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,230
ontologically serious do we want to be
about those things by which i mean are

2382
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:16,240
about those things by which i mean are
 

2383
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,630
about those things by which i mean are
they just a construction of out of our

2384
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:18,640
they just a construction of out of our
 

2385
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,630
they just a construction of out of our
minds and the fact that we interact in

2386
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:20,640
minds and the fact that we interact in
 

2387
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,349
minds and the fact that we interact in
the

2388
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:21,359

the
standard standardly scientifically

00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:25,040
accepted ways
 

2393
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,270

or is as someone like rupert sheldrake

2394
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:27,280
or is as someone like rupert sheldrake
 

2395
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,109
or is as someone like rupert sheldrake
would think that there is some

2396
00:42:29,109 --> 00:42:29,119
would think that there is some
 

2397
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,750
would think that there is some
metaphysical reality there are some

2398
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:31,760
metaphysical reality there are some
 

2399
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,430
metaphysical reality there are some
fields beyond the scientifically

2400
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:33,440
fields beyond the scientifically
 

2401
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,630
fields beyond the scientifically
understood ones that are somehow

2402
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:34,640
understood ones that are somehow
 

2403
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,950
understood ones that are somehow
communicating this um

2404
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:36,960
communicating this um
 

2405
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,470
communicating this um
i mean i think that i mean the view i

2406
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:38,480
i mean i think that i mean the view i
 

2407
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,230
i mean i think that i mean the view i
was describing was that this element

2408
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:40,240
was describing was that this element
 

2409
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,309
was describing was that this element
we're supposed to have in common is

2410
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:42,319
we're supposed to have in common is
 

2411
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:45,349
we're supposed to have in common is
is some sort of pure impersonal

2412
00:42:45,349 --> 00:42:45,359
is some sort of pure impersonal
 

2413
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,430
is some sort of pure impersonal
consciousness or something rather than

2414
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:47,440
consciousness or something rather than
 

2415
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,710
consciousness or something rather than
so actually i mean an interesting figure

2416
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:48,720
so actually i mean an interesting figure
 

2417
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,710
so actually i mean an interesting figure
is the the australian philosopher mirial

2418
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:50,720
is the the australian philosopher mirial

uh advice of a dante mysticism
 

2425
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,470
uh advice of a dante mysticism
but like me she's from this tradition of

2426
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:02,480
but like me she's from this tradition of
 

2427
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,630
but like me she's from this tradition of
analytic philosophy and so she defends

2428
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:04,640
analytic philosophy and so she defends
 

2429
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,790
analytic philosophy and so she defends
this in this you know incredibly precise

2430
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:06,800
this in this you know incredibly precise
 

2431
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,710
this in this you know incredibly precise
rigorous way she defends the idea that

2432
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:08,720
rigorous way she defends the idea that
 

2433
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,990
rigorous way she defends the idea that
we should think of experienced

2434
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:10,000
we should think of experienced
 

2435
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,589
we should think of experienced
meditators as

2436
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:11,599
meditators as
 

2437
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,470
meditators as

uh providing expert testimony
 

2439
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,349
uh providing expert testimony
so you know i think

2440
00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:17,359
so you know i think
 

2441
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,910
so you know i think
humans cause a causing climate breakdown

2442
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:19,920
humans cause a causing climate breakdown
 

2443
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,910
humans cause a causing climate breakdown
i have no idea the science behind it you

00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:21,920
i have no idea the science behind it you
 

2445
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,069
i have no idea the science behind it you
know i but i trust the experts or you

princeton university or something
like those those psychonauts they have

2624
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:31,680
like those those psychonauts they have
 

2625
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,230
like those those psychonauts they have
wisdom if it's done rigorously

2626
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:34,240
wisdom if it's done rigorously
 

2627
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,150
wisdom if it's done rigorously
uh which you can also do rigorously

2628
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:36,160
uh which you can also do rigorously
 

2629
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,910
uh which you can also do rigorously
within the university within the studies

2630
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:37,920
within the university within the studies
 

2631
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,470
within the university within the studies
now with the with psilocybin and those

2632
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:40,480
now with the with psilocybin and those
 

2633
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,390
now with the with psilocybin and those
kinds of things yeah that's

2634
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:42,400
kinds of things yeah that's
 

2635
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,790
kinds of things yeah that's
fascinating still probably the best one

2636
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:44,800
fascinating still probably the best one
 

2637
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,589
fascinating still probably the best one
of the best works on mystical experience

2638
00:46:47,589 --> 00:46:47,599
of the best works on mystical experience
 

2639
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:48,309
of the best works on mystical experience
is

2640
00:46:48,309 --> 00:46:48,319
is
 

2641
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,109
is
the chapter in william james's varieties

2642
00:46:51,109 --> 00:46:51,119
the chapter in william james's varieties
 

2643
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,950
the chapter in william james's varieties
of religious experiences

2644
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:52,960
of religious experiences
 

2645
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,030
of religious experiences
and most of it is um just a

2646
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:55,040
and most of it is um just a
 

2647
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,270
and most of it is um just a
psychological study of trying to define

2648
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:57,280
psychological study of trying to define
 

2649
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,550
psychological study of trying to define
the characteristics of mystical

2650
00:46:58,550 --> 00:46:58,560
the characteristics of mystical
 

2651
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,510
the characteristics of mystical
experience as a psychological type

2652
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:01,520
experience as a psychological type
 

2653
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,470
experience as a psychological type
but at the end he considers the question

2654
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:04,480
but at the end he considers the question
 

2655
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,630
but at the end he considers the question
if you have a mystical experience is it

2656
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:06,640
if you have a mystical experience is it
 

2657
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,870
if you have a mystical experience is it
rational to trust it to trust that it's

2658
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:08,880
rational to trust it to trust that it's
 

2659
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,430
rational to trust it to trust that it's
telling you something about reality and

2660
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:11,440
telling you something about reality and
 

2661
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,950
telling you something about reality and
he makes an interesting argument he says

2662
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:12,960
he makes an interesting argument he says
 

2663
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,950
he makes an interesting argument he says
if you say no

2664
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:14,960
if you say no
 

2665
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,309
if you say no
you're kind of applying a double

2666
00:47:16,309 --> 00:47:16,319
you're kind of applying a double
 

2667
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:17,670
you're kind of applying a double
standard

2668
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:17,680
standard
 

2669
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,589
standard
because we all think it's okay to trust

2670
00:47:19,589 --> 00:47:19,599
because we all think it's okay to trust
 

2671
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:20,309
because we all think it's okay to trust
our

2672
00:47:20,309 --> 00:47:20,319
our
 

2673
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,030
our
normal sensory experiences

2674
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:23,040
normal sensory experiences
 

2675
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,870
normal sensory experiences
but we have no way of

2676
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:24,880
but we have no way of
 

2677
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,510
but we have no way of
getting outside of ourselves to prove

2678
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:27,520
getting outside of ourselves to prove
 

2679
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,349
getting outside of ourselves to prove
that our sensory experiences correspond

2680
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:29,359
that our sensory experiences correspond
 

2681
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,510
that our sensory experiences correspond
to an external reality we could be in

2682
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:31,520
to an external reality we could be in
 

2683
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,349
to an external reality we could be in
the matrix this could be a very vivid

2684
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:33,359
the matrix this could be a very vivid
 

2685
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,910
the matrix this could be a very vivid
dream uh you know you could say or we do

2686
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:35,920
dream uh you know you could say or we do
 

2687
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,510
dream uh you know you could say or we do
science but

2688
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:37,520
science but
 

2689
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,829
science but
a scientist only

2690
00:47:39,829 --> 00:47:39,839
a scientist only
 

2691
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,430
a scientist only
gets their data by

2692
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:41,440
gets their data by
 

2693
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,589
gets their data by
experiencing the results of their

2694
00:47:43,589 --> 00:47:43,599
experiencing the results of their
 

2695
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,589
experiencing the results of their
experiments and then the question arises

2696
00:47:45,589 --> 00:47:45,599
experiments and then the question arises
 

2697
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,109
experiments and then the question arises
again how do you know that corresponds

2698
00:47:47,109 --> 00:47:47,119
again how do you know that corresponds
 

2699
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,349
again how do you know that corresponds
to a real world so he thinks there's a

2700
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:49,359
to a real world so he thinks there's a
 

2701
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:51,750
to a real world so he thinks there's a
sort of double standard in saying

2702
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:51,760
sort of double standard in saying
 

2703
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,589
sort of double standard in saying
it's okay to trust our ordinary sensory

2704
00:47:53,589 --> 00:47:53,599
it's okay to trust our ordinary sensory
 

2705
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,829
it's okay to trust our ordinary sensory
experiences but it's not okay for the

2706
00:47:55,829 --> 00:47:55,839
experiences but it's not okay for the
 

2707
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,470
experiences but it's not okay for the
person on dmt to trust those experiences

2708
00:47:58,470 --> 00:47:58,480
person on dmt to trust those experiences
 

2709
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,069
person on dmt to trust those experiences
it's very philosophically difficult to

2710
00:48:00,069 --> 00:48:00,079
it's very philosophically difficult to
 

2711
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:00,870
it's very philosophically difficult to
say

2712
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:00,880
say
 

2713
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,030
say
why is it okay in the one case

2714
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:03,040
why is it okay in the one case
 

2715
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:03,750
why is it okay in the one case
and

2716
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:03,760
and
 

2717
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,349
and
not the other so i think there's an

2718
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:05,359
not the other so i think there's an
 

2719
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:07,510
not the other so i think there's an
interesting argument there but i would

2720
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:07,520
interesting argument there but i would
 

2721
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,670
interesting argument there but i would
like to just defend experts a little bit

2722
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:09,680
like to just defend experts a little bit
 

2723
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,470
like to just defend experts a little bit
i mean i agree it's very difficult

2724
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:12,480
i mean i agree it's very difficult
 

2725
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,710
i mean i agree it's very difficult
but especially in an age i guess where

2726
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:14,720
but especially in an age i guess where
 

2727
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,870
but especially in an age i guess where
there's so much information

2728
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:16,880
there's so much information
 

2729
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,030
there's so much information
i do think it's important

2730
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:19,040
i do think it's important
 

2731
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,030
i do think it's important
to have

2732
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:21,040
to have
 

2733
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,069
to have
some

2734
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:22,079
some
 

2735
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,390
some
protection of

2736
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:24,400
protection of
 

2737
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,710
protection of
sources of information academic

2738
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:26,720
sources of information academic
 

2739
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,030
sources of information academic
institutions that we can trust

2740
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:29,040
institutions that we can trust
 

2741
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,230
institutions that we can trust
and then that's difficult because of

2742
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:30,240
and then that's difficult because of
 

2743
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,470
and then that's difficult because of
course there are non-academics who do

2744
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:32,480
course there are non-academics who do
 

2745
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,309
course there are non-academics who do
know what they're talking about but like

2746
00:48:34,309 --> 00:48:34,319
know what they're talking about but like
 

2747
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:35,829
know what they're talking about but like
if i'm

2748
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:35,839
if i'm
 

2749
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,349
if i'm
interested in knowing about biology you

2750
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:37,359
interested in knowing about biology you
 

2751
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,990
interested in knowing about biology you
know you can't research everything

2752
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:40,000
know you can't research everything
 

2753
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,069
know you can't research everything
so i think we have to have

2754
00:48:42,069 --> 00:48:42,079
so i think we have to have
 

2755
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,470
so i think we have to have
some sense of

2756
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:44,480
some sense of
 

2757
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,230
some sense of
who are the experts

2758
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:46,240
who are the experts
 

2759
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,390
who are the experts
we can trust the people who've spent a

2760
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:48,400
we can trust the people who've spent a
 

2761
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,630
we can trust the people who've spent a
lot of time reading all the material

2762
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:50,640
lot of time reading all the material
 

2763
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,109
lot of time reading all the material
that people have read written um

2764
00:48:53,109 --> 00:48:53,119
that people have read written um
 

2765
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:54,549
that people have read written um
thinking about it

2766
00:48:54,549 --> 00:48:54,559
thinking about it
 

2767
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:55,829
thinking about it
having their

2768
00:48:55,829 --> 00:48:55,839
having their
 

2769
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:58,069
having their
their views torn apart by other people

2770
00:48:58,069 --> 00:48:58,079
their views torn apart by other people
 

2771
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,829
their views torn apart by other people
working in the field i think that is

2772
00:48:59,829 --> 00:48:59,839
working in the field i think that is
 

2773
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:01,670
working in the field i think that is
very important and also to protect that

2774
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:01,680
very important and also to protect that
 

2775
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,670
very important and also to protect that
from conflicts of interest there is a

2776
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:03,680
from conflicts of interest there is a
 

2777
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,589
from conflicts of interest there is a
so-called think tank in the uk called

2778
00:49:05,589 --> 00:49:05,599
so-called think tank in the uk called
 

2779
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,990
so-called think tank in the uk called
the institute of economic affairs who

2780
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:08,000
the institute of economic affairs who
 

2781
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,470
the institute of economic affairs who
are always on the bbc as

the very value of that journey towards
knowledge so some of it probably just

00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:23,359
knowledge so some of it probably just
 

2903
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:26,549
knowledge so some of it probably just
reduces to like skillful communication

black belt when
you take consideration of the advice of

you take consideration of the advice of

00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:02,309
you take consideration of the advice of
different people me versus somebody

3272
00:58:02,309 --> 00:58:02,319
different people me versus somebody
 

3273

different people me versus somebody
who's only practiced for like a couple

3274
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:03,920
who's only practiced for like a couple
 

3275
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:04,950
who's only practiced for like a couple
of days

3276
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:04,960
of days
 

3277
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,630
of days
but at the same time

3278
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:06,640
but at the same time
 

3279
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:10,950
but at the same time
the raw practice of ideas that is combat

3280
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:10,960
the raw practice of ideas that is combat
 

3281
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,109
the raw practice of ideas that is combat
and the raw practice of exchange of

3282
00:58:13,109 --> 00:58:13,119
and the raw practice of exchange of
 

3283
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,270
and the raw practice of exchange of
ideas that is science

3284
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:15,280
ideas that is science
 

3285
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,270
ideas that is science
needs to often throw away expertise and

3286
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:19,280
needs to often throw away expertise and
 

3287
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,589
needs to often throw away expertise and
in communicating like there's an other

3288
00:58:21,589 --> 00:58:21,599
in communicating like there's an other
 

3289
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:23,750
in communicating like there's an other
thing to science and expertise which is

3290
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:23,760
thing to science and expertise which is
 

3291
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,109
thing to science and expertise which is
leadership

3292
00:58:25,109 --> 00:58:25,119
leadership
 

3293
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:26,470
leadership
it's not just

3294
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:26,480
it's not just
 

3295
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,390
it's not just
so the scientific method in the review

3296
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:28,400
so the scientific method in the review
 

3297
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:31,990
so the scientific method in the review
process is this rigorous battle of ideas

3298
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:32,000
process is this rigorous battle of ideas
 

3299
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,109
process is this rigorous battle of ideas
between scientists but there's also a

3300
00:58:35,109 --> 00:58:35,119
between scientists but there's also a
 

3301
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,589
between scientists but there's also a
stepping up and inspiring the world and

3302
00:58:37,589 --> 00:58:37,599
stepping up and inspiring the world and
 

3303
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:39,589
stepping up and inspiring the world and
communicating ideas to the world and

3304
00:58:39,589 --> 00:58:39,599
communicating ideas to the world and
 

3305
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,549
communicating ideas to the world and
that skill of communication

3306
00:58:42,549 --> 00:58:42,559
that skill of communication
 

3307
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:45,990
that skill of communication
i suppose that's my biggest criticism of

3308
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:46,000
i suppose that's my biggest criticism of
 

3309
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,549
i suppose that's my biggest criticism of
so-called experts in science is there

3310
00:58:48,549 --> 00:58:48,559
so-called experts in science is there
 

3311
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:51,349
so-called experts in science is there
just shitty communication absolutely

3312
00:58:51,349 --> 00:58:51,359
just shitty communication absolutely
 

3313
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:53,190
just shitty communication absolutely
yeah well i can totally i get very

3314
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:53,200
yeah well i can totally i get very
 

3315
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,349
yeah well i can totally i get very
frustrated with philosophers

3316
00:58:55,349 --> 00:58:55,359
frustrated with philosophers
 

3317
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:58,309
frustrated with philosophers
not reaching out more i mean i i think

3318
00:58:58,309 --> 00:58:58,319
not reaching out more i mean i i think
 

3319
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:00,390
not reaching out more i mean i i think
i think it might be partly that we're

3320
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:00,400
i think it might be partly that we're
 

3321
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,870
i think it might be partly that we're
trained to get get water tight arguments

3322
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:02,880
trained to get get water tight arguments
 

3323
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,349
trained to get get water tight arguments
you know respond to all objections and

3324
00:59:05,349 --> 00:59:05,359
you know respond to all objections and
 

3325
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:07,109
you know respond to all objections and
as you do that

3326
00:59:07,109 --> 00:59:07,119
as you do that
 

3327
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:09,109
as you do that
eventually it gets more complicated and

3328
00:59:09,109 --> 00:59:09,119
eventually it gets more complicated and
 

3329
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:11,270
eventually it gets more complicated and
the jargon comes in and

3330
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:11,280
the jargon comes in and
 

3331
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,390
the jargon comes in and
um but then if so to write and write a

3332
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:14,400
um but then if so to write and write a
 

3333
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,109
um but then if so to write and write a
more accessible book or article you have

3334
00:59:17,109 --> 00:59:17,119
more accessible book or article you have
 

3335
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,589
more accessible book or article you have
to loosen the argument a bit and then we

3336
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:19,599
to loosen the argument a bit and then we
 

3337
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:20,950
to loosen the argument a bit and then we
worry that other philosophers will think

3338
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:20,960
worry that other philosophers will think
 

3339
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,630
worry that other philosophers will think
oh that's a really crap argument so i

3340
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:22,640
oh that's a really crap argument so i
 

3341
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,150
oh that's a really crap argument so i
mean the way i did it i wrote my

3342
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:24,160
mean the way i did it i wrote my
 

3343
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,150
mean the way i did it i wrote my
academic book first it's just some

3344
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:26,160
academic book first it's just some
 

3345
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,230
academic book first it's just some
fundamental reality

3346
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:28,240
fundamental reality
 

3347
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,069
fundamental reality
and then a more accessible book

3348
00:59:30,069 --> 00:59:30,079
and then a more accessible book
 

3349
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:31,670
and then a more accessible book
galileo's era where the arguments you

3350
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:31,680
galileo's era where the arguments you
 

3351
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,910
galileo's era where the arguments you
know not as rigorously worked out so

3352
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:33,920
know not as rigorously worked out so
 

3353
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,910
know not as rigorously worked out so
then i can say the proper arguments that

3354
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:35,920
then i can say the proper arguments that
 

3355
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,910
then i can say the proper arguments that
you know the further arguments there but

3356
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:37,920
you know the further arguments there but
 

3357
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,349
you know the further arguments there but
but i guess it's brilliantly done by the

3358
00:59:39,349 --> 00:59:39,359
but i guess it's brilliantly done by the
 

3359
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:42,069
but i guess it's brilliantly done by the
way like there's that that's such a so

3360
00:59:42,069 --> 00:59:42,079
way like there's that that's such a so
 

3361
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,309
way like there's that that's such a so
so for people don't know you first wrote

3362
00:59:44,309 --> 00:59:44,319
so for people don't know you first wrote
 

3363
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:46,630
so for people don't know you first wrote
consciousness and fundamental reality so

3364
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:46,640
consciousness and fundamental reality so
 

3365
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:49,109
consciousness and fundamental reality so
that's the academic book also very good

3366
00:59:49,109 --> 00:59:49,119
that's the academic book also very good
 

3367
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,349
that's the academic book also very good
i flew through it last night uh bought

3368
00:59:51,349 --> 00:59:51,359
i flew through it last night uh bought
 

3369
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:53,589
i flew through it last night uh bought
it and then obviously the popular book

3370
00:59:53,589 --> 00:59:53,599
it and then obviously the popular book
 

3371
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:56,069
it and then obviously the popular book
is uh galileo's era foundations for a

3372
00:59:56,069 --> 00:59:56,079
is uh galileo's era foundations for a
 

3373
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:58,309
is uh galileo's era foundations for a
new science of consciousness that's kind

3374
00:59:58,309 --> 00:59:58,319
new science of consciousness that's kind
 

3375
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:00,549
new science of consciousness that's kind
of the right way to do it yeah to show

3376
01:00:00,549 --> 01:00:00,559
of the right way to do it yeah to show
 

3377
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:02,230
of the right way to do it yeah to show
that you're legit to your community to

3378
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:02,240
that you're legit to your community to
 

3379
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,670
that you're legit to your community to
the world by doing the book that's

3380
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:03,680
the world by doing the book that's
 

3381
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,349
the world by doing the book that's
nobody going to read

3382
01:00:05,349 --> 01:00:05,359
nobody going to read
 

3383
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:09,190
nobody going to read
and then doing a popular book

3384
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:09,200
and then doing a popular book
 

3385
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,109
and then doing a popular book
that everybody's going to read that's

3386
01:00:11,109 --> 01:00:11,119
that everybody's going to read that's
 

3387
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:12,950
that everybody's going to read that's
cool well i try now every time i write

3388
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:12,960
cool well i try now every time i write
 

3389
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,789
cool well i try now every time i write
an academic article

3390
01:00:14,789 --> 01:00:14,799
an academic article
 

3391
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:17,349
an academic article
i try to write a more accessible

3392
01:00:17,349 --> 01:00:17,359
i try to write a more accessible
 

3393
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:18,789
i try to write a more accessible
version i mean the thing i've been

3394
01:00:18,789 --> 01:00:18,799
version i mean the thing i've been
 

3395
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:21,270
version i mean the thing i've been
working on recently just because

3396
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:21,280
working on recently just because
 

3397
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,069
working on recently just because
there's this argument um

3398
01:00:24,069 --> 01:00:24,079
there's this argument um
 

3399
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:28,150
there's this argument um
so there there's a certain argument from

3400
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:28,160
so there there's a certain argument from
 

3401
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,230
so there there's a certain argument from
the cosmological fine-tuning of the laws

3402
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:30,240
the cosmological fine-tuning of the laws
 

3403
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,030
the cosmological fine-tuning of the laws
of physics for life to the multiverse

3404
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:33,040
of physics for life to the multiverse
 

3405
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,109
of physics for life to the multiverse
that's quite popular physicists like max

3406
01:00:35,109 --> 01:00:35,119
that's quite popular physicists like max
 

3407
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:36,230
that's quite popular physicists like max

3411
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,990
um
there's there's there's an

3412
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:40,000
there's there's there's an
 

3413
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,470
there's there's there's an
argument in philosophy journals that

3414
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:42,480
argument in philosophy journals that
 

3415
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,109
argument in philosophy journals that
that that's there's a fallacious

3416
01:00:45,109 --> 01:00:45,119
that that's there's a fallacious
 

3417
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:46,789
that that's there's a fallacious
line of reasoning

3418
01:00:46,789 --> 01:00:46,799
line of reasoning
 

3419
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:48,870
line of reasoning
going on there from the fine-tuning to

3420
01:00:48,870 --> 01:00:48,880
going on there from the fine-tuning to
 

3421
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,430
going on there from the fine-tuning to
the multiverse now that argument is from

3422
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:51,440
the multiverse now that argument is from
 

3423
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,910
the multiverse now that argument is from
20 30 years ago and it's you know

3424
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:53,920
20 30 years ago and it's you know
 

3425
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,549
20 30 years ago and it's you know
discussed in academic philosophy nobody

3426
01:00:56,549 --> 01:00:56,559
discussed in academic philosophy nobody

this is evidence for god and nobody
knows about this argument which tries to

show that it's fallacious reasoning to
 

3441
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,069
show that it's fallacious reasoning to
go from the fine tuning to the

think it's very rare
 

3477
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,990
think it's very rare
to find a good philosopher

3478

have it torn apart but
 

3489
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,430
have it torn apart but
that's maybe thinking of it in the

3490
01:01:57,430 --> 01:01:57,440
that's maybe thinking of it in the
 

3491
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,789
that's maybe thinking of it in the
slightly the wrong way but

3492
01:01:58,789 --> 01:01:58,799
slightly the wrong way but
 

3493
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:01,829
slightly the wrong way but
have the best objections raised to it

3494
01:02:01,829 --> 01:02:01,839
have the best objections raised to it
 

3495
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:03,510
have the best objections raised to it
you know and

3496
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:03,520
you know and
 

3497
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,430
you know and
that's why

3498
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:05,440
that's why
 

3499
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,829
that's why
that that is an important formative

3500
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:07,839
that that is an important formative
 

3501
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:10,309
that that is an important formative
process that you go through as an

3502
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:10,319
process that you go through as an
 

3503
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:13,349
process that you go through as an
academic that the greatest minds

3504

academic that the greatest minds
 

3505

um
 

3507
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:16,789
um
starting a philosophy degree for example

3508
01:02:16,789 --> 01:02:16,799

01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:39,349
not just gone through that but continue
to go through that absolutely that's i

3532
01:02:39,349 --> 01:02:39,359
to go through that absolutely that's i

01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,390
and
yeah i i think

3590
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:40,400
yeah i i think
 

3591
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,230
yeah i i think
everyone still gives talks or should

3592
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:42,240
everyone still gives talks or should
 

3593
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,789
everyone still gives talks or should
gives talk give talks and people are

3594
01:03:44,789 --> 01:03:44,799
gives talk give talks and people are
 

3595
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:46,710
gives talk give talks and people are
wanting to

3596
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:46,720
wanting to
 

3597
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,230
wanting to
work out if there are any weaknesses to

3598
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:48,240
work out if there are any weaknesses to
 

3599
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,710
work out if there are any weaknesses to
your position so

3600
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:50,720
your position so
 

3601
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:53,349
your position so
yeah i think that generally works out

3602
01:03:53,349 --> 01:03:53,359
yeah i think that generally works out
 

3603
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:57,349
yeah i think that generally works out
there is also kind of um

3604
01:03:57,349 --> 01:03:57,359

 

3605
01:03:57,359 --> 01:04:00,549

who do you give the talks to hmm

3606
01:04:00,549 --> 01:04:00,559
who do you give the talks to hmm
 

3607
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:03,670
who do you give the talks to hmm
so i mean within communities

3608
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:03,680
so i mean within communities
 

3609
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,750
so i mean within communities
it's a little cluster of people that

3610
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:05,760
it's a little cluster of people that
 

3611
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,990
it's a little cluster of people that
argue and bicker

3612
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:08,000
argue and bicker
 

3613
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,470
argue and bicker
but what are they arguing about

3614
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:10,480
but what are they arguing about
 

3615
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,710
but what are they arguing about
they take a bunch of stuff

3616
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:12,720
they take a bunch of stuff
 

3617
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,470
they take a bunch of stuff
a bunch of basic assumptions as

3618
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:14,480
a bunch of basic assumptions as
 

3619
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:15,990
a bunch of basic assumptions as
agreement

3620
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:16,000
agreement
 

3621
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,029
agreement
and they

3622
01:04:17,029 --> 01:04:17,039
and they
 

3623
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:19,510
and they
heatedly argue about certain ideas the

3624
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:19,520
heatedly argue about certain ideas the
 

3625
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,510
heatedly argue about certain ideas the
question is how opener that that's

3626
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:21,520
question is how opener that that's
 

3627
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,670
question is how opener that that's
actually kind of like fun that's like

3628
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:23,680
actually kind of like fun that's like
 

3629
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,670
actually kind of like fun that's like
no offense sorry we're sticking on this

3630
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:25,680
no offense sorry we're sticking on this
 

3631
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,430
no offense sorry we're sticking on this
martial arts thing it's like people who

3632
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:27,440
martial arts thing it's like people who
 

3633
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,190
martial arts thing it's like people who
practice aikido or

3634
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:29,200
practice aikido or
 

3635
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,950
practice aikido or
certain martial arts that don't truly

3636
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:30,960
certain martial arts that don't truly
 

3637
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:34,150
certain martial arts that don't truly
test themselves in the in the cage in

3638
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:34,160
test themselves in the in the cage in
 

3639
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,190
test themselves in the in the cage in
combat

3640
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:35,200
combat
 

3641
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,510
combat
so it's like it's fun to argue about

3642
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:37,520
so it's like it's fun to argue about
 

3643
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,270
so it's like it's fun to argue about
like certain things when you're in your

3644
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:39,280
like certain things when you're in your
 

3645
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,270
like certain things when you're in your
own community but you don't test those

3646
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:41,280
own community but you don't test those
 

3647
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,109
own community but you don't test those
ideas in the full

3648
01:04:43,109 --> 01:04:43,119
ideas in the full
 

3649
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:46,150
ideas in the full
uh context of science

3650
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:46,160
uh context of science
 

3651
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,829
uh context of science
in the full like

3652
01:04:47,829 --> 01:04:47,839
in the full like
 

3653
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:50,390
in the full like
seriousness the the rigor

3654
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:50,400
seriousness the the rigor
 

3655
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,870
seriousness the the rigor
of the sometimes like the real world one

3656
01:04:52,870 --> 01:04:52,880
of the sometimes like the real world one
 

3657
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,349
of the sometimes like the real world one
of my favorite fields is psychology

3658
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:55,359
of my favorite fields is psychology
 

3659
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:58,069
of my favorite fields is psychology
there's often places within psychology

3660
01:04:58,069 --> 01:04:58,079
there's often places within psychology
 

3661
01:04:58,079 --> 01:04:59,910
there's often places within psychology
where you're kind of doing these studies

3662
01:04:59,910 --> 01:04:59,920
where you're kind of doing these studies
 

3663
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,430
where you're kind of doing these studies
and arguing about stuff that's done in

3664
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:01,440
and arguing about stuff that's done in
 

3665
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,549
and arguing about stuff that's done in
the lab

3666
01:05:02,549 --> 01:05:02,559
the lab
 

3667
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:04,230
the lab
the arguments

3668
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:04,240
the arguments
 

3669
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,069
the arguments
are

3670
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:06,079
are
 

3671
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:08,950
are
almost disjoint from real human behavior

3672
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:08,960
almost disjoint from real human behavior
 

3673
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,630
almost disjoint from real human behavior
because it's so much easier to study

3674
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:10,640
because it's so much easier to study
 

3675
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,710
because it's so much easier to study
human behavior in the lab you just kind

3676
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:12,720
human behavior in the lab you just kind
 

3677
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:13,910
human behavior in the lab you just kind
of stay there and that's where the

3678
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:13,920
of stay there and that's where the
 

3679
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,990
of stay there and that's where the
arguments are and so vision science is a

3680
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:16,000
arguments are and so vision science is a
 

3681
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,910
arguments are and so vision science is a
good example like studying uh eye

3682
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:17,920
good example like studying uh eye
 

3683
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,589
good example like studying uh eye
movement and how we perceive the world

3684
01:05:19,589 --> 01:05:19,599
movement and how we perceive the world
 

3685
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:21,109
movement and how we perceive the world
and all that kind of stuff it's so much

3686
01:05:21,109 --> 01:05:21,119
and all that kind of stuff it's so much
 

3687
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:22,870
and all that kind of stuff it's so much
easier to study in a lab that we don't

3688
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:22,880
easier to study in a lab that we don't
 

3689
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,630
easier to study in a lab that we don't
consider

3690
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:24,640
consider
 

3691
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,069
consider
we say that's going to be what the

3692
01:05:26,069 --> 01:05:26,079
we say that's going to be what the
 

3693
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:27,750
we say that's going to be what the
science of vision is going to be like

3694
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:27,760
science of vision is going to be like
 

3695
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,349
science of vision is going to be like
and we don't consider the science

3696
01:05:29,349 --> 01:05:29,359
and we don't consider the science
 

3697
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:31,029
and we don't consider the science
division in the actual real world the

3698
01:05:31,029 --> 01:05:31,039
division in the actual real world the
 

3699
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:33,430
division in the actual real world the
engineering of yeah i don't know and so

3700
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:33,440
engineering of yeah i don't know and so
 

3701
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,589
engineering of yeah i don't know and so
i think that's where

3702
01:05:35,589 --> 01:05:35,599
i think that's where
 

3703
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,589
i think that's where
exposing yourself to out of the box

3704
01:05:37,589 --> 01:05:37,599
exposing yourself to out of the box
 

3705
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:39,910
exposing yourself to out of the box
ideas yeah that's the most painful

3706
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:39,920
ideas yeah that's the most painful
 

3707
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,430
ideas yeah that's the most painful
that's the most important i mean group

3708
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:41,440
that's the most important i mean group
 

3709
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,630
that's the most important i mean group
thing can be a terrible thing in

3710
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:42,640
thing can be a terrible thing in
 

3711
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,549
thing can be a terrible thing in
philosophy as well but because you're

3712
01:05:44,549 --> 01:05:44,559
philosophy as well but because you're
 

3713
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:45,990
philosophy as well but because you're
not

3714
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:46,000
not
 

3715
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,549
not
to the same extent beholden to evidence

3716
01:05:48,549 --> 01:05:48,559
to the same extent beholden to evidence
 

3717
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:50,870
to the same extent beholden to evidence
and refutation from the evidence that

3718
01:05:50,870 --> 01:05:50,880
and refutation from the evidence that
 

3719
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,029
and refutation from the evidence that
you are in the sciences uh it's a more

3720
01:05:53,029 --> 01:05:53,039
you are in the sciences uh it's a more
 

3721
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:56,390
you are in the sciences uh it's a more
subtle process of evaluation and so more

3722
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:56,400
subtle process of evaluation and so more
 

3723
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,470
subtle process of evaluation and so more
susceptible i think to group think yeah

3724
01:05:58,470 --> 01:05:58,480
susceptible i think to group think yeah
 

3725
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,950
susceptible i think to group think yeah
i agree it's a danger

3726
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:00,960
i agree it's a danger
 

3727
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,470
i agree it's a danger
we've talked about it a million times

3728
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:02,480
we've talked about it a million times
 

3729
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,710
we've talked about it a million times
but uh let's let's try to sort of do

3730
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:04,720
but uh let's let's try to sort of do
 

3731
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,270
but uh let's let's try to sort of do
that old uh basic terminology

3732
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:07,280
that old uh basic terminology
 

3733
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:08,549
that old uh basic terminology
definitions

3734
01:06:08,549 --> 01:06:08,559
definitions
 

3735
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:11,270
definitions
what is pan psychism like what are the

3736
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:11,280
what is pan psychism like what are the
 

3737
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,470
what is pan psychism like what are the
different

3738
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:12,480
different
 

3739
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:15,270
different
ways you can try to to think about to

3740
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:15,280
ways you can try to to think about to
 

3741
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,430
ways you can try to to think about to
define pan psychos and

3742
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:17,440
define pan psychos and
 

3743
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,309
define pan psychos and
in contrast to uh

3744
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:20,319
in contrast to uh
 

3745
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:23,029
in contrast to uh
naturalistic dualism and materialism and

3746
01:06:23,029 --> 01:06:23,039
naturalistic dualism and materialism and
 

3747
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:27,029
naturalistic dualism and materialism and
other kind of views of consciousness

3748
01:06:27,029 --> 01:06:27,039
other kind of views of consciousness
 

3749
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:28,309
other kind of views of consciousness
yeah so that

3750
01:06:28,309 --> 01:06:28,319
yeah so that
 

3751
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:30,789
yeah so that
you've basically laid out the different

3752
01:06:30,789 --> 01:06:30,799
you've basically laid out the different
 

3753
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:33,349
you've basically laid out the different
options so i guess

3754
01:06:33,349 --> 01:06:33,359
options so i guess
 

3755
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:34,950
options so i guess
probably still the dominant view is

3756
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:34,960
probably still the dominant view is
 

3757
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,029
probably still the dominant view is
materialism that

3758
01:06:37,029 --> 01:06:37,039
materialism that
 

3759
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:39,109
materialism that
roughly that we can explain

3760
01:06:39,109 --> 01:06:39,119
roughly that we can explain
 

3761
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:40,710
roughly that we can explain
consciousness in in the terms of

01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:40,720
consciousness in in the terms of
 

3763
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,910
consciousness in in the terms of
physical science wholly explain it just

3764
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:43,920
physical science wholly explain it just
 

3765
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,029
physical science wholly explain it just
in terms of

01:06:45,029 --> 01:06:45,039
in terms of
 

3767
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:46,710
in terms of
the electrochemical signaling in the

01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:46,720
the electrochemical signaling in the

3773
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,829
dualism the polar opposite view
that consciousness is

01:06:53,829 --> 01:06:53,839
that consciousness is
 

3775
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:56,470
that consciousness is
non-physical outside of the physical

um and you know when i studied

3782
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:02,319
um and you know when i studied
 

3783
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:04,390
um and you know when i studied
philosophy we were taught basically they

3784
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:04,400
philosophy we were taught basically they
 

3785
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,990
philosophy we were taught basically they
were the two options you had to choose

3786
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:06,000
were the two options you had to choose
 

3787
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,670
were the two options you had to choose
right either you thought it you were

3788
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:07,680
right either you thought it you were
 

3789
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,349
right either you thought it you were
duelist and you

3790
01:07:09,349 --> 01:07:09,359
duelist and you
 

3791
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:10,390
duelist and you
thought it was separate from the

3792
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:10,400
thought it was separate from the
 

3793
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,789
thought it was separate from the
physical or you thought it was just

3794
01:07:12,789 --> 01:07:12,799
physical or you thought it was just
 

3795
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:14,870
physical or you thought it was just
electrochemical signaling and yeah i

3796
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:14,880
electrochemical signaling and yeah i
 

3797
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,309
electrochemical signaling and yeah i
became very disillusioned because i

3798
01:07:16,309 --> 01:07:16,319
became very disillusioned because i
 

3799
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:17,990
became very disillusioned because i
think there are big problems with both

3800
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:18,000
think there are big problems with both
 

3801
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,510
think there are big problems with both
of these options

3802
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:19,520
of these options
 

3803
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:20,630
of these options
so i think the attraction of pan

3804
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:20,640
so i think the attraction of pan
 

3805
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:23,109
so i think the attraction of pan
psychism is it's kind of a middle way

3806
01:07:23,109 --> 01:07:23,119
psychism is it's kind of a middle way
 

3807
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:24,789
psychism is it's kind of a middle way
it agrees with the materialist that

3808
01:07:24,789 --> 01:07:24,799
it agrees with the materialist that
 

3809
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,549
it agrees with the materialist that
there's just the physical world

3810
01:07:26,549 --> 01:07:26,559
there's just the physical world
 

3811
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:28,150
there's just the physical world
ultimately there's just particles and

01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:28,160
ultimately there's just particles and

01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,829
ultimately there's just particles and

3815
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:30,630
fields
but

3816
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:30,640
but
 

3817
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,950
but
the pan pancychist

01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:32,960
the pan pancychist
 

3819
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,710
the pan pancychist
thinks there's there's more to the

thinks there's there's more to the
 

3821
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,309
thinks there's there's more to the
physical than what physical science

physical than what physical science

it's a huge debate

it's a huge debate

01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,630
it's a huge debate
but i think that the core of it is that

but i think that the core of it is that

essentially involves qualities if you
think about the smell of coffee or the

think about the smell of coffee or the

i think these qualities

01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:29,520
i think these qualities
 

3875
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,669
i think these qualities
can't be captured in the purely

you'll just
 

3889
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,669
you'll just
leave out these qualities and that's

3890
01:08:43,669 --> 01:08:43,679
leave out these qualities and that's
 

3891
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:46,149
leave out these qualities and that's
really leave out consciousness itself

3892
01:08:46,149 --> 01:08:46,159
really leave out consciousness itself
 

3893
01:08:46,159 --> 01:08:47,590
really leave out consciousness itself
and then dualism

3894
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:47,600
and then dualism
 

3895
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,349
and then dualism
so i've actually changed my mind a

3896
01:08:49,349 --> 01:08:49,359
so i've actually changed my mind a
 

3897
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:51,030
so i've actually changed my mind a
little bit on this since i wrote the

3898
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:51,040
little bit on this since i wrote the
 

3899
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,430
little bit on this since i wrote the
book so i mean i argued in the book that

3900
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:53,440
book so i mean i argued in the book that
 

3901
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:55,269
book so i mean i argued in the book that
we have

3902
01:08:55,269 --> 01:08:55,279
we have
 

3903
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:57,349
we have
pretty good experimental grounds for

01:08:57,349 --> 01:08:57,359
pretty good experimental grounds for

01:08:57,359 --> 01:08:59,269
pretty good experimental grounds for
doubting dualism

3906
01:08:59,269 --> 01:08:59,279
doubting dualism
 

3907
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:02,470
doubting dualism
and roughly the idea was

3908
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:02,480
and roughly the idea was
 

3909
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:05,510
and roughly the idea was
if dualism were true if there was say an

3910
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:05,520
if dualism were true if there was say an

up in our neuroscience you know there'd

3920
01:09:14,149 --> 01:09:14,159
up in our neuroscience you know there'd
 

3921
01:09:14,159 --> 01:09:15,669
up in our neuroscience you know there'd
be all sorts of

be all sorts of
 

3923
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:17,430
be all sorts of

a poltergeist was playing with the brain

3930
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:22,960
a poltergeist was playing with the brain
 

3931
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:23,990
a poltergeist was playing with the brain
um

3932
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:24,000
um
 

3933
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,349
um
but actually

3934
01:09:25,349 --> 01:09:25,359
but actually
 

3935
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:26,709
but actually
and so the you know the fact that we

3936
01:09:26,709 --> 01:09:26,719
and so the you know the fact that we
 

3937
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:28,789
and so the you know the fact that we
don't find that

3938
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:28,799
don't find that
 

3939
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:30,789
don't find that

01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:33,189
is a strong and ever-growing inductive

you know the more i talk to

3944
01:09:34,309 --> 01:09:34,319
you know the more i talk to
 

3945
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:36,309
you know the more i talk to

i i don't think we know enough about the

3954
01:09:43,269 --> 01:09:43,279
i i don't think we know enough about the
 

3955
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,349
i i don't think we know enough about the

brain about the workings of the brain to
 

3957
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:47,269
brain about the workings of the brain to
make that argument

3958
01:09:47,269 --> 01:09:47,279
make that argument
 

3959
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:49,669
make that argument
um i think we know we know a lot about

3960
01:09:49,669 --> 01:09:49,679
um i think we know we know a lot about
 

3961
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:51,349
um i think we know we know a lot about
the basic chemistry

3962
01:09:51,349 --> 01:09:51,359
the basic chemistry
 

3963
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:52,309
the basic chemistry
um

3964
01:09:52,309 --> 01:09:52,319
um
 

3965
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:54,430
um
how neurons fire

3966
01:09:54,430 --> 01:09:54,440
how neurons fire
 

3967
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,470
how neurons fire
neurotransmitters action potentials

3968
01:09:56,470 --> 01:09:56,480
neurotransmitters action potentials
 

3969
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,149

things like that we know a fair bit

3970
01:09:58,149 --> 01:09:58,159
things like that we know a fair bit
 

3971
01:09:58,159 --> 01:09:59,430
things like that we know a fair bit
about

3972
01:09:59,430 --> 01:09:59,440
about
 

3973
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,270
about
large scale functions of the brain what

3974
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:01,280
large scale functions of the brain what
 

3975
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,830
large scale functions of the brain what
different bits of the brain do

3976
01:10:03,830 --> 01:10:03,840
different bits of the brain do
 

3977
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:07,110
different bits of the brain do
but what we're almost clueless on is

3978
01:10:07,110 --> 01:10:07,120
but what we're almost clueless on is
 

3979
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,669
but what we're almost clueless on is
how those large scale functions are

3980
01:10:09,669 --> 01:10:09,679
how those large scale functions are
 

3981
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:11,910
how those large scale functions are
realized at the cellular level how it

3982
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:11,920
realized at the cellular level how it
 

3983
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,110
realized at the cellular level how it
works

3984
01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:13,120
works
 

3985
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:15,110
works
um you know people get quite excited

3986
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:15,120
um you know people get quite excited
 

3987
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,950
um you know people get quite excited
about brain scans but

3988
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:16,960
about brain scans but
 

3989
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,870
about brain scans but
it's very low resolution you know every

3990
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:18,880
it's very low resolution you know every
 

3991
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,430
it's very low resolution you know every
pixel on a brain scan corresponds to

3992
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:21,440
pixel on a brain scan corresponds to
 

3993
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:26,790
pixel on a brain scan corresponds to
5.5 million neurons and we're only um

3994
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:26,800
5.5 million neurons and we're only um
 

3995
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,709
5.5 million neurons and we're only um
we're only 70 of the way through

3996
01:10:28,709 --> 01:10:28,719
we're only 70 of the way through
 

3997
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:30,390
we're only 70 of the way through
constructing a connectome for the for

3998
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:30,400
constructing a connectome for the for
 

3999
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,750
constructing a connectome for the for
the maggot brain

4000
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:31,760
the maggot brain
 

4001
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,910
the maggot brain
which has is it 10 000 or 100 000

4002
01:10:33,910 --> 01:10:33,920
which has is it 10 000 or 100 000
 

4003
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,830
which has is it 10 000 or 100 000
neurons but you know the brain has 86

4004
01:10:35,830 --> 01:10:35,840
neurons but you know the brain has 86
 

4005
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,189
neurons but you know the brain has 86
billion neurons

4006
01:10:37,189 --> 01:10:37,199
billion neurons
 

4007
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:39,510
billion neurons
so i think we'd have to know a lot more

4008
01:10:39,510 --> 01:10:39,520
so i think we'd have to know a lot more
 

4009
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:40,630
so i think we'd have to know a lot more
about

4010
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:40,640
about
 

4011
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,470
about
how the brain works

4012
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:42,480
how the brain works
 

4013
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:45,430
how the brain works
how these functions are realized

4014
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:45,440
how these functions are realized
 

4015
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,350
how these functions are realized
um

4016
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:47,360
um
 

4017
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:49,830
um
before we could assess whether they can

4018
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:49,840
before we could assess whether they can
 

4019
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,590
before we could assess whether they can
be the dynamics of the brain can be

4020
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:51,600
be the dynamics of the brain can be
 

4021
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,669
be the dynamics of the brain can be
completely explicated in terms of

01:10:53,669 --> 01:10:53,679
completely explicated in terms of
 

4023
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:56,870
completely explicated in terms of
underlying chemistry or physics so um

4024
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:56,880
underlying chemistry or physics so um
 

4025
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,630
underlying chemistry or physics so um
you know we'd have to do more

4026
01:10:58,630 --> 01:10:58,640
you know we'd have to do more
 

4027
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,350
you know we'd have to do more
engineering before we could uh figure

consciousness properties and they're

4080
01:11:55,910 --> 01:11:55,920
consciousness properties and they're
 

4081
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,669
consciousness properties and they're
radically different kinds of things

4082
01:11:57,669 --> 01:11:57,679
radically different kinds of things
 

4083
01:11:57,679 --> 01:11:59,750
radically different kinds of things
whereas the pan psychist offers a much

4084
01:11:59,750 --> 01:11:59,760
whereas the pan psychist offers a much
 

4085
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,750
whereas the pan psychist offers a much
more simple unified picture of reality

4086
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:01,760
more simple unified picture of reality
 

4087
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:03,030
more simple unified picture of reality
so i think it's still the view to be

4088
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:03,040
so i think it's still the view to be
 

4089
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,070
so i think it's still the view to be
preferred

4090
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:04,080
preferred
 

4091
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,430
preferred
you know to put it very simply why

4092
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:05,440
you know to put it very simply why
 

4093
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:07,350
you know to put it very simply why
believe in two kinds of thing

4094
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:07,360
believe in two kinds of thing
 

4095
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:08,870
believe in two kinds of thing
when you can just get away with one and

4096
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:08,880
when you can just get away with one and
 

4097
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,669
when you can just get away with one and
materialism is also very simple but

4098
01:12:11,669 --> 01:12:11,679
materialism is also very simple but
 

4099
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:14,709
materialism is also very simple but
you're saying it doesn't explain

4100
01:12:14,709 --> 01:12:14,719
you're saying it doesn't explain
 

4101
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:16,470
you're saying it doesn't explain
something that seems pretty important

4102
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:16,480
something that seems pretty important
 

4103
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,390
something that seems pretty important
yeah so i think materialism can't you

4104
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:18,400
yeah so i think materialism can't you
 

4105
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,709
yeah so i think materialism can't you
know we try science is about trying to

4106
01:12:20,709 --> 01:12:20,719
know we try science is about trying to
 

4107
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:22,229
know we try science is about trying to
find the simplest theory that accounts

4108
01:12:22,229 --> 01:12:22,239
find the simplest theory that accounts
 

4109
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:24,229
find the simplest theory that accounts
for the data i don't think materialism

4110
01:12:24,229 --> 01:12:24,239
for the data i don't think materialism
 

4111
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:25,990
for the data i don't think materialism
can account for the data

4112
01:12:25,990 --> 01:12:26,000
can account for the data
 

4113
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,870
can account for the data
maybe dualism can account for the data

4114
01:12:28,870 --> 01:12:28,880
maybe dualism can account for the data
 

4115
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:31,030
maybe dualism can account for the data
but pan psychism is simpler it can

4116
01:12:31,030 --> 01:12:31,040
but pan psychism is simpler it can
 

4117
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:33,510
but pan psychism is simpler it can
account for the data and it's simpler

4118
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:33,520
account for the data and it's simpler
 

4119
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:37,110
account for the data and it's simpler
what is pan psychism

4120
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:37,120
what is pan psychism
 

4121
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,950
what is pan psychism
so in its broadest definition it's the

4122
01:12:38,950 --> 01:12:38,960
so in its broadest definition it's the
 

4123
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,070
so in its broadest definition it's the
view that

4124
01:12:40,070 --> 01:12:40,080
view that
 

4125
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:43,189
view that
consciousness is a fundamental um and

4126
01:12:43,189 --> 01:12:43,199
consciousness is a fundamental um and
 

4127
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:47,110
consciousness is a fundamental um and

these very simple

forms of experience at the level of
 

4159
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,790
forms of experience at the level of
basic physics but i mean maybe the

4160
01:13:18,790 --> 01:13:18,800
basic physics but i mean maybe the
 

4161
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,229
basic physics but i mean maybe the
crucial bit about

4162
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:20,239
crucial bit about
 

4163
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:23,350
crucial bit about
the kind of pan psychism i defend

4164
01:13:23,350 --> 01:13:23,360
the kind of pan psychism i defend
 

4165
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,430
the kind of pan psychism i defend
what it does is it

4166
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:25,440
what it does is it
 

4167
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:26,790
what it does is it
it takes the

4168
01:13:26,790 --> 01:13:26,800
it takes the
 

4169
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,149
it takes the
standard approach to the problem of

4170
01:13:28,149 --> 01:13:28,159
standard approach to the problem of
 

4171
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:29,590
standard approach to the problem of
consciousness

4172
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:29,600
consciousness
 

4173
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,669
consciousness
and turns it on its head right so the

4174
01:13:31,669 --> 01:13:31,679
and turns it on its head right so the
 

4175
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:35,590
and turns it on its head right so the
standard approach is to think um

4176
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:35,600
standard approach is to think um
 

4177
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,350
standard approach is to think um
we start with matter

4178
01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:37,360
we start with matter
 

4179
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,790
we start with matter
and we think how do we get consciousness

4180
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:38,800
and we think how do we get consciousness
 

4181
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,470
and we think how do we get consciousness
out of matter so i don't think that

4182
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:40,480
out of matter so i don't think that
 

4183
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,709
out of matter so i don't think that
problem can be solved for reasons i've

4184
01:13:42,709 --> 01:13:42,719
problem can be solved for reasons i've
 

4185
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:43,990
problem can be solved for reasons i've
kind of hinted out we could maybe go

4186
01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:44,000
kind of hinted out we could maybe go
 

4187
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,430
kind of hinted out we could maybe go
into more detail

4188
01:13:45,430 --> 01:13:45,440
into more detail
 

4189
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,110
into more detail
but the pancitis does it the other way

4190
01:13:47,110 --> 01:13:47,120
but the pancitis does it the other way
 

4191
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:48,470
but the pancitis does it the other way
around

4192
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:48,480
around
 

4193
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:51,430
around
they start with consciousness and try to

4194
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:51,440
they start with consciousness and try to
 

4195
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,510
they start with consciousness and try to
get mata out of consciousness so the

4196
01:13:53,510 --> 01:13:53,520
get mata out of consciousness so the
 

4197
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,110
get mata out of consciousness so the
idea is basically

4198
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:55,120
idea is basically
 

4199
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,110
idea is basically
at the fundamental level of reality

4200
01:13:57,110 --> 01:13:57,120
at the fundamental level of reality
 

4201
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,830
at the fundamental level of reality
there are just

4202
01:13:58,830 --> 01:13:58,840
there are just
 

4203
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:02,709
there are just
um networks of very simple conscious

4204
01:14:02,709 --> 01:14:02,719
um networks of very simple conscious
 

4205
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:03,910
um networks of very simple conscious
entities

4206
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:03,920
entities
 

4207
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:04,790
entities
um

4208
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:04,800
um
 

4209
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,790
um
but these conscious entities because

4210
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:06,800
but these conscious entities because
 

4211
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,390
but these conscious entities because
they're behave they have very simple

4212
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:08,400
they're behave they have very simple
 

4213
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:09,830
they're behave they have very simple
kinds of experience they behave in

4214
01:14:09,830 --> 01:14:09,840
kinds of experience they behave in
 

4215
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,350
kinds of experience they behave in
predictable ways

4216
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:11,360
predictable ways
 

4217
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,189
predictable ways
through their interactions they realize

4218
01:14:13,189 --> 01:14:13,199
through their interactions they realize
 

4219
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:15,110
through their interactions they realize
certain mathematical structures

4220
01:14:15,110 --> 01:14:15,120
certain mathematical structures
 

4221
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:16,790
certain mathematical structures
and then the idea is those mathematical

4222
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:16,800
and then the idea is those mathematical
 

4223
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,110
and then the idea is those mathematical
structures just are

4224
01:14:19,110 --> 01:14:19,120
structures just are
 

4225
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,830
structures just are
the structures identified by physics

4226
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:21,840
the structures identified by physics
 

4227
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:22,630
the structures identified by physics
so

4228
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:22,640
so
 

4229
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,790
so
when we think about these simple

4230
01:14:24,790 --> 01:14:24,800
when we think about these simple
 

4231
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,790
when we think about these simple
conscious entities in terms of the

4232
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:26,800
conscious entities in terms of the
 

4233
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,790
conscious entities in terms of the
mathematical structures they realize we

4234
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:28,800
mathematical structures they realize we
 

4235
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,189
mathematical structures they realize we
call them particles we call them fields

4236
01:14:31,189 --> 01:14:31,199
call them particles we call them fields
 

4237
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:32,390
call them particles we call them fields
we call

4238
01:14:32,390 --> 01:14:32,400
we call
 

4239
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,310
we call
the their properties mass spin and

4240
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:34,320
the their properties mass spin and
 

4241
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:35,270
the their properties mass spin and
charge

4242
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:35,280
charge
 

4243
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:37,910
charge
but really there's just

4244
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:37,920
but really there's just
 

4245
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,669
but really there's just
these very simple conscious entities and

4246
01:14:39,669 --> 01:14:39,679
these very simple conscious entities and
 

4247
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:42,790
these very simple conscious entities and
their experiences so in this way we get

4248
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:42,800
their experiences so in this way we get
 

4249
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,229
their experiences so in this way we get
physics

4250
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:44,239
physics
 

4251
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:45,990
physics
out of consciousness i don't think you

4252
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:46,000
out of consciousness i don't think you
 

4253
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,350
out of consciousness i don't think you
can get consciousness out of physics but

4254
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:47,360
can get consciousness out of physics but
 

4255
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,189
can get consciousness out of physics but
i think it's pretty easy to get physics

4256
01:14:49,189 --> 01:14:49,199
i think it's pretty easy to get physics
 

4257
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:51,910
i think it's pretty easy to get physics
out of consciousness well

4258
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:51,920
out of consciousness well
 

4259
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:55,430
out of consciousness well
i'm a little confused by why

4260
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:55,440
i'm a little confused by why
 

4261
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,630
i'm a little confused by why
you need to get physics out of

4262
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:56,640
you need to get physics out of
 

4263
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,709
you need to get physics out of
consciousness i did i mean to me it

4264
01:14:58,709 --> 01:14:58,719
consciousness i did i mean to me it
 

4265
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:00,229
consciousness i did i mean to me it
sounds like

4266
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:00,239
sounds like
 

4267
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:01,750
sounds like
pan psychism

4268
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:01,760
pan psychism
 

4269
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:05,270
pan psychism
unites consciousness and physics i mean

4270
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:05,280
unites consciousness and physics i mean
 

4271
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,590
unites consciousness and physics i mean
physics is is the

4272
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:07,600
physics is is the
 

4273
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:10,310
physics is is the
mathematical science of describing

4274
01:15:10,310 --> 01:15:10,320
mathematical science of describing
 

4275
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:12,550
mathematical science of describing
everything so physics should be able to

4276
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:12,560
everything so physics should be able to
 

4277
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,390
everything so physics should be able to
describe consciousness

4278
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:14,400
describe consciousness
 

4279
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,229
describe consciousness
pan psychism in my understanding

4280
01:15:16,229 --> 01:15:16,239
pan psychism in my understanding
 

4281
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:17,590
pan psychism in my understanding
proposes

4282
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:17,600
proposes
 

4283
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,229
proposes
is that physics doesn't currently do so

4284
01:15:20,229 --> 01:15:20,239
is that physics doesn't currently do so
 

4285
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:22,790
is that physics doesn't currently do so
but can in the future i mean it seems

4286
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:22,800
but can in the future i mean it seems
 

4287
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,950
but can in the future i mean it seems
like consciousness

4288
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:24,960
like consciousness
 

4289
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,030
like consciousness
you have like stephen wolfram who's all

4290
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:27,040
you have like stephen wolfram who's all
 

4291

um

4294
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:30,400
um

um
mathematical frameworks within which to

01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:35,760
mathematical frameworks within which to
 

4301
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,990
mathematical frameworks within which to
describe how we get all the reality that

01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,310
we perceive around us
to me there's no reason why that kind of

4306
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:42,320
to me there's no reason why that kind of
 

4307
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,709
to me there's no reason why that kind of
framework cannot also include

uh pan psychist theories have uh truth

4324
01:15:59,590 --> 01:15:59,600
uh pan psychist theories have uh truth
 

4325
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,910
uh pan psychist theories have uh truth
to them so like to me it is physics you

4326
01:16:01,910 --> 01:16:01,920
to them so like to me it is physics you
 

4327
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,910
to them so like to me it is physics you
said kind of physics emerges you by

4328
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:03,920
said kind of physics emerges you by
 

4329
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,510
said kind of physics emerges you by
which you mean like the the basic four

4330
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:05,520
which you mean like the the basic four
 

4331
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,110
which you mean like the the basic four

01:16:15,110 --> 01:16:15,120
the base consciousness layer that's what
 

4341
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:17,750
the base consciousness layer that's what
you mean yeah so maybe the way i phrased

4342
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:17,760
you mean yeah so maybe the way i phrased
 

4343
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,110
you mean yeah so maybe the way i phrased
it made it sound like these things are

4344
01:16:19,110 --> 01:16:19,120
it made it sound like these things are
 

4345
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:20,870
it made it sound like these things are
more separate than they are what i was

01:16:20,870 --> 01:16:20,880
more separate than they are what i was

01:16:28,229 --> 01:16:28,239
misunderstanding of panseikism that it's
 

4353
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:30,470
misunderstanding of panseikism that it's
a sort of dualistic theory

01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:30,480
a sort of dualistic theory

the idea is that particles have their

physicists sabine hossenfelder had a

4368
01:16:42,709 --> 01:16:42,719
physicists sabine hossenfelder had a
 

4369
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:45,030
physicists sabine hossenfelder had a
blog post critiquing pan psychism maybe

4370
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:45,040
blog post critiquing pan psychism maybe
 

4371
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,550
blog post critiquing pan psychism maybe
a couple of years ago now that got a

4372
01:16:46,550 --> 01:16:46,560
a couple of years ago now that got a
 

4373
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,510
a couple of years ago now that got a
fair bit of traction and she was

4374
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:49,520
fair bit of traction and she was
 

4375
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,990
fair bit of traction and she was
interpreting psychism in this way and

4376
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:52,000
interpreting psychism in this way and
 

4377
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,430
interpreting psychism in this way and
then her thought was

4378
01:16:53,430 --> 01:16:53,440
then her thought was
 

4379
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,510
then her thought was
well look if particles had these funny

4380
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:55,520
well look if particles had these funny
 

4381
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:57,510
well look if particles had these funny
consciousness properties then it would

4382
01:16:57,510 --> 01:16:57,520
consciousness properties then it would
 

4383
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,270
consciousness properties then it would
show up in our physics like the standard

4384
01:16:59,270 --> 01:16:59,280
show up in our physics like the standard
 

4385
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:00,870
show up in our physics like the standard
model of particle physics would make

4386
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:00,880
model of particle physics would make
 

4387
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:01,990
model of particle physics would make
false predictions because its

4388
01:17:01,990 --> 01:17:02,000
false predictions because its
 

4389
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,830
false predictions because its
predictions are based wholly on the

4390
01:17:03,830 --> 01:17:03,840
predictions are based wholly on the
 

4391
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,990
predictions are based wholly on the
physical properties if there were also

4392
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:06,000
physical properties if there were also
 

4393
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,070
physical properties if there were also
these consciousness properties uh we'd

4394
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:08,080
these consciousness properties uh we'd
 

4395
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,910
these consciousness properties uh we'd
get different predictions but that's a

4396
01:17:09,910 --> 01:17:09,920
get different predictions but that's a
 

4397
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:12,550
get different predictions but that's a
misunderstanding of the view the view is

4398
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:12,560
misunderstanding of the view the view is
 

4399
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:13,830
misunderstanding of the view the view is
it's not that there are two kinds of

4400
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:13,840
it's not that there are two kinds of
 

4401
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:16,870
it's not that there are two kinds of
property that mass spin and charge

4402
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:16,880
property that mass spin and charge
 

4403
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:17,830
property that mass spin and charge
are

4404
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:17,840
are
 

4405
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,910
are
forms of consciousness how do we make

4406
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:19,920
forms of consciousness how do we make
 

4407
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,590
forms of consciousness how do we make
sense of that because

4408
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:21,600
sense of that because
 

4409
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,350
sense of that because
actually when you look at what physics

4410
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:23,360
actually when you look at what physics
 

4411
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:25,110
actually when you look at what physics
physics tells us it's really just

4412
01:17:25,110 --> 01:17:25,120
physics tells us it's really just
 

4413
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:26,470
physics tells us it's really just
telling us

4414
01:17:26,470 --> 01:17:26,480
telling us
 

4415
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,189
telling us
about behavior about what stuff does

4416
01:17:29,189 --> 01:17:29,199
about behavior about what stuff does
 

4417
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:30,709
about behavior about what stuff does
i sometimes put it by saying uh doing

4418
01:17:30,709 --> 01:17:30,719
i sometimes put it by saying uh doing
 

4419
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:31,990
i sometimes put it by saying uh doing
physics is like

4420
01:17:31,990 --> 01:17:32,000
physics is like
 

4421
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,430
physics is like
playing chess when you don't care what

4422
01:17:33,430 --> 01:17:33,440
playing chess when you don't care what
 

4423
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:34,550
playing chess when you don't care what
the pieces are made of you're just

4424
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:34,560
the pieces are made of you're just
 

4425
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,550
the pieces are made of you're just
interested in what moves you can make so

4426
01:17:36,550 --> 01:17:36,560
interested in what moves you can make so
 

4427
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,149
interested in what moves you can make so
physics tells us what mass spin and

4428
01:17:38,149 --> 01:17:38,159
physics tells us what mass spin and
 

4429
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:40,310
physics tells us what mass spin and
charge do

4430
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:40,320
charge do
 

4431
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:41,430
charge do
um

4432
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:41,440
um
 

4433
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,189
um
but it doesn't tell us

4434
01:17:43,189 --> 01:17:43,199
but it doesn't tell us
 

4435
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:44,870
but it doesn't tell us
what they are

4436
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:44,880
what they are
 

4437
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:45,830
what they are
so

4438
01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:45,840
so
 

4439
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:48,149
so
so the idea the experience of mass so

4440
01:17:48,149 --> 01:17:48,159
so the idea the experience of mass so
 

4441
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:50,709
so the idea the experience of mass so
the idea is yeah mass in its nature is a

4442
01:17:50,709 --> 01:17:50,719
the idea is yeah mass in its nature is a
 

4443
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:52,229
the idea is yeah mass in its nature is a
very simple form of consciousness so

4444
01:17:52,229 --> 01:17:52,239
very simple form of consciousness so
 

4445
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:54,310
very simple form of consciousness so
yeah physics in a sense is complete i

4446
01:17:54,310 --> 01:17:54,320
yeah physics in a sense is complete i
 

4447
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,630
yeah physics in a sense is complete i
think because it tells us

4448
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:56,640
think because it tells us
 

4449
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,229
think because it tells us
what everything at the fundamental level

4450
01:17:58,229 --> 01:17:58,239
what everything at the fundamental level
 

4451
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:01,910
what everything at the fundamental level
does it describes its causal capacities

4452
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:01,920
does it describes its causal capacities
 

4453
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:03,510
does it describes its causal capacities
but

4454
01:18:03,510 --> 01:18:03,520
but
 

4455
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:05,590
but
for the panzerkist at least physics

4456
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:05,600
for the panzerkist at least physics
 

4457
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,350
for the panzerkist at least physics
doesn't tell us what matter

4458
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:07,360
doesn't tell us what matter
 

4459
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:10,070
doesn't tell us what matter
is it tells us what it does but not what

4460
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:10,080
is it tells us what it does but not what
 

4461
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,229
is it tells us what it does but not what
it is

4462
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:12,239
it is
 

4463
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:14,470
it is
to push back on the thing i think she's

4464
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:14,480
to push back on the thing i think she's
 

4465
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,550
to push back on the thing i think she's
criticizing is it also possible so i

4466
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:16,560
criticizing is it also possible so i
 

4467
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:17,669
criticizing is it also possible so i
understand what you're saying but is it

4468
01:18:17,669 --> 01:18:17,679
understand what you're saying but is it
 

4469
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:20,070
understand what you're saying but is it
also possible that particles have

4470
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:20,080
also possible that particles have
 

4471
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,470
also possible that particles have
another property like consciousness i

4472
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:22,480
another property like consciousness i
 

4473
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,149
another property like consciousness i
don't understand the criticism we would

4474
01:18:24,149 --> 01:18:24,159
don't understand the criticism we would
 

4475
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:26,870
don't understand the criticism we would
be able to detect it in our uh

4476
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:26,880
be able to detect it in our uh
 

4477
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:29,110
be able to detect it in our uh
experiments well no if you're not

4478
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:29,120
experiments well no if you're not
 

4479
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:30,950
experiments well no if you're not
looking for it

4480
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:30,960
looking for it
 

4481
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,270
looking for it
there's a lot of stuff that are uh

4482
01:18:33,270 --> 01:18:33,280
there's a lot of stuff that are uh
 

4483
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:34,709
there's a lot of stuff that are uh
orthogonal

4484
01:18:34,709 --> 01:18:34,719
orthogonal
 

4485
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:36,630
orthogonal
like if you're not looking for the stuff

4486
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:36,640
like if you're not looking for the stuff
 

4487
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,550
like if you're not looking for the stuff
you're not going to detect it because

4488
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:38,560
you're not going to detect it because
 

4489
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:42,310
you're not going to detect it because
like all of our basic empirical science

4490
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:42,320
like all of our basic empirical science
 

4491
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:44,229
like all of our basic empirical science
through its recent history and yes the

4492
01:18:44,229 --> 01:18:44,239
through its recent history and yes the
 

4493
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:46,470
through its recent history and yes the
history of science is quite recent

4494
01:18:46,470 --> 01:18:46,480
history of science is quite recent
 

4495
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:49,910
history of science is quite recent
uh has been very kind of focused on

4496
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:49,920
uh has been very kind of focused on
 

4497
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:52,310
uh has been very kind of focused on
billiard balls colliding

4498
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:52,320
billiard balls colliding
 

4499
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,550
billiard balls colliding
and uh from that understanding how

4500
01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:54,560
and uh from that understanding how
 

4501
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:57,110
and uh from that understanding how
gravity works but like we just haven't

4502
01:18:57,110 --> 01:18:57,120
gravity works but like we just haven't
 

4503
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:58,310
gravity works but like we just haven't
integrated

4504
01:18:58,310 --> 01:18:58,320
integrated
 

4505
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,790
integrated
other possibilities into this i i don't

4506
01:19:00,790 --> 01:19:00,800
other possibilities into this i i don't
 

4507
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,310
other possibilities into this i i don't
think there will be conflicting whether

4508
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:02,320
think there will be conflicting whether
 

4509
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,550
think there will be conflicting whether
you are observing consciousness or not

4510
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:04,560
you are observing consciousness or not
 

4511
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,709
you are observing consciousness or not
or exploring some of these ideas

4512
01:19:06,709 --> 01:19:06,719
or exploring some of these ideas
 

4513
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:09,270
or exploring some of these ideas
um i don't think that affects the rest

4514
01:19:09,270 --> 01:19:09,280
um i don't think that affects the rest
 

4515
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,830
um i don't think that affects the rest
of the physics the the mass the energy

like the hierarchy of different

01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,350

i don't think

i don't think
 

4527
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:23,750
i don't think
it feels like consciousness is something

it feels like consciousness is something

there's there's something quite distinct

01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,229
science nancy cartwright he's got this
book how the laws of physics lie where

uh things in very specific circumstances
 

4565
01:19:58,560 --> 01:19:59,430
uh things in very specific circumstances
and then

4566
01:19:59,430 --> 01:19:59,440
and then
 

4567
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:01,430
and then
in an unwarranted way generalize that

4568
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:01,440
in an unwarranted way generalize that
 

4569
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:03,590
in an unwarranted way generalize that

you're saying but
 

4605
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:38,470
you're saying but
i'm just saying i don't it's possible

i'm just saying i don't it's possible

i'm just saying i don't it's possible
that's true it's possible also that

that's true it's possible also that
 

4609
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,990
that's true it's possible also that

in fact to me that's more compelling

in fact to me that's more compelling
 

4619
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:52,709
in fact to me that's more compelling
because then that's going to be

because then that's going to be
 

4621
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:54,470
because then that's going to be
well no i think both are very compelling

4622
01:20:54,470 --> 01:20:54,480
well no i think both are very compelling
 

4623
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,149
well no i think both are very compelling
but um

4624
01:20:56,149 --> 01:20:56,159
but um
 

4625
01:20:56,159 --> 01:20:58,229

it feels like it's more within the reach

it feels like it's more within the reach

guess it's supposed to be a kind of

guess it's supposed to be a kind of

what matter does

4714
01:22:40,229 --> 01:22:40,239
what matter does
 

4715
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:43,830
what matter does
consciousness is what matter is so so

4716
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:43,840
consciousness is what matter is so so
 

4717
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,430
consciousness is what matter is so so
matter is sort of what consciousness

4718
01:22:45,430 --> 01:22:45,440
matter is sort of what consciousness
 

4719
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:46,390
matter is sort of what consciousness
does

4720
01:22:46,390 --> 01:22:46,400
does
 

4721
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:49,669
does
so at the bottom level there is just

4722
01:22:49,669 --> 01:22:49,679
so at the bottom level there is just
 

4723
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:51,430
so at the bottom level there is just
consciousness and conscious things

4724
01:22:51,430 --> 01:22:51,440
consciousness and conscious things
 

4725
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,350
consciousness and conscious things
they're just these simple things with

4726
01:22:53,350 --> 01:22:53,360
they're just these simple things with
 

4727
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:55,350
they're just these simple things with
their experiences and that is their

4728
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:55,360
their experiences and that is their
 

4729
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:58,629
their experiences and that is their
total nature so in that sense it's not

4730
01:22:58,629 --> 01:22:58,639
total nature so in that sense it's not
 

4731
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:01,110
total nature so in that sense it's not
another player it's just

4732
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:01,120
another player it's just
 

4733
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:04,310
another player it's just
all there is really and then we describe

4734
01:23:04,310 --> 01:23:04,320
all there is really and then we describe
 

4735
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,629
all there is really and then we describe
in physics we describe that at a certain

4736
01:23:06,629 --> 01:23:06,639
in physics we describe that at a certain
 

4737
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:09,030
in physics we describe that at a certain
level of abstraction we just we we

4738
01:23:09,030 --> 01:23:09,040
level of abstraction we just we we
 

4739
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:11,030
level of abstraction we just we we
capture what bertrand russell who was

4740
01:23:11,030 --> 01:23:11,040
capture what bertrand russell who was
 

4741
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,510
capture what bertrand russell who was
the inspiration for a lot of this um

4742
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:13,520
the inspiration for a lot of this um
 

4743
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:16,070
the inspiration for a lot of this um
calls the causal skeleton of the world

4744
01:23:16,070 --> 01:23:16,080
calls the causal skeleton of the world
 

4745
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:17,350
calls the causal skeleton of the world
so you know physics is just interesting

4746
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:17,360
so you know physics is just interesting
 

4747
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:18,870
so you know physics is just interesting
the causal skeleton of the world it's

4748
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:18,880
the causal skeleton of the world it's
 

4749
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,470
the causal skeleton of the world it's
not interested in the sort of flesh and

4750
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:20,480
not interested in the sort of flesh and
 

4751
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:21,990
not interested in the sort of flesh and
blood although that that's maybe

4752
01:23:21,990 --> 01:23:22,000
blood although that that's maybe
 

4753
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,110
blood although that that's maybe
suggesting separation again too much

4754
01:23:25,110 --> 01:23:25,120
suggesting separation again too much
 

4755
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:28,629
suggesting separation again too much
all metaphors fail in the end but um

4756
01:23:28,629 --> 01:23:28,639
all metaphors fail in the end but um
 

4757
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:30,070
all metaphors fail in the end but um
yeah so

4758
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:30,080
yeah so
 

4759
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:32,870
yeah so
so yeah you totally write ultimately

4760
01:23:32,870 --> 01:23:32,880
so yeah you totally write ultimately
 

4761
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,830
so yeah you totally write ultimately
what we want to explain is how

4762
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:35,840
what we want to explain is how
 

4763
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,430
what we want to explain is how
our consciousness and the consciousness

4764
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:37,440
our consciousness and the consciousness
 

4765
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,350
our consciousness and the consciousness
of other animals comes out of this if we

4766
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:39,360
of other animals comes out of this if we
 

4767
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:40,870
of other animals comes out of this if we
can't do that then

4768
01:23:40,870 --> 01:23:40,880
can't do that then
 

4769
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:43,590
can't do that then
it's game over but

4770
01:23:43,590 --> 01:23:43,600
it's game over but
 

4771
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:44,870
it's game over but
i i think it

4772
01:23:44,870 --> 01:23:44,880
i i think it
 

4773
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,870
i i think it
maybe makes more sense it on the

4774
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:46,880
maybe makes more sense it on the
 

4775
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:49,030
maybe makes more sense it on the
identity claim that if if matter at the

4776
01:23:49,030 --> 01:23:49,040
identity claim that if if matter at the
 

4777
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:50,950
identity claim that if if matter at the
fundamental level just is forms of

4778
01:23:50,950 --> 01:23:50,960
fundamental level just is forms of
 

4779
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,189
fundamental level just is forms of
consciousness then we can perhaps make

4780
01:23:53,189 --> 01:23:53,199
consciousness then we can perhaps make
 

4781
01:23:53,199 --> 01:23:55,189
consciousness then we can perhaps make
sense of how those simple forms of

4782
01:23:55,189 --> 01:23:55,199
sense of how those simple forms of
 

4783
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:57,270
sense of how those simple forms of
consciousness in some way combine in

4784
01:23:57,270 --> 01:23:57,280
consciousness in some way combine in
 

4785
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,709
consciousness in some way combine in
some way to make

4786
01:23:58,709 --> 01:23:58,719
some way to make
 

4787
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:00,070
some way to make
the consciousness we know and love

4788
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:00,080
the consciousness we know and love
 

4789
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:02,629
the consciousness we know and love
that's the dream yeah so

4790
01:24:02,629 --> 01:24:02,639
that's the dream yeah so
 

4791
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:06,229
that's the dream yeah so
i guess the question is um

4792
01:24:06,229 --> 01:24:06,239

 

4793
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:08,870

so the reason you can describe like the

4794
01:24:08,870 --> 01:24:08,880
so the reason you can describe like the
 

4795
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:11,189
so the reason you can describe like the
reason you have material engineering

4796
01:24:11,189 --> 01:24:11,199
reason you have material engineering
 

4797
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:13,669
reason you have material engineering
material science

4798
01:24:13,669 --> 01:24:13,679
material science
 

4799
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:16,550
material science
is because you have from physics

4800
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:16,560
is because you have from physics
 

4801
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:19,430
is because you have from physics
to chemistry like you keep going up and

4802
01:24:19,430 --> 01:24:19,440
to chemistry like you keep going up and
 

4803
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:20,310
to chemistry like you keep going up and
up

4804
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:20,320
up
 

4805
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:21,430
up
in

4806
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:21,440
in
 

4807
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,430
in
levels of complexity

4808
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:23,440
levels of complexity
 

4809
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:25,189
levels of complexity
in order to describe

4810
01:24:25,189 --> 01:24:25,199
in order to describe
 

4811
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:28,149
in order to describe
objects that we have in our

4812
01:24:28,149 --> 01:24:28,159
objects that we have in our
 

4813
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:29,590
objects that we have in our
human world

4814
01:24:29,590 --> 01:24:29,600
human world
 

4815
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:30,950
human world
and it would be nice to do the same

4816
01:24:30,950 --> 01:24:30,960
and it would be nice to do the same
 

4817
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,030
and it would be nice to do the same
thing for consciousness to come up with

4818
01:24:33,030 --> 01:24:33,040
thing for consciousness to come up with
 

4819
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:35,430
thing for consciousness to come up with
the chemistry of consciousness right

4820
01:24:35,430 --> 01:24:35,440
the chemistry of consciousness right
 

4821
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:36,870
the chemistry of consciousness right
like how

4822
01:24:36,870 --> 01:24:36,880
like how
 

4823
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:37,830
like how
like

4824
01:24:37,830 --> 01:24:37,840
like
 

4825
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:40,229
like
how do the different particles interact

4826
01:24:40,229 --> 01:24:40,239
how do the different particles interact
 

4827
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:41,590
how do the different particles interact
to create more

4828
01:24:41,590 --> 01:24:41,600
to create more
 

4829
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,669
to create more
uh greater complexity so you can do this

4830
01:24:43,669 --> 01:24:43,679
uh greater complexity so you can do this
 

4831
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:46,149
uh greater complexity so you can do this
kind of thing for life like what is life

4832
01:24:46,149 --> 01:24:46,159
kind of thing for life like what is life
 

4833
01:24:46,159 --> 01:24:48,070
kind of thing for life like what is life
like living organisms

4834
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:48,080
like living organisms
 

4835
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:50,790
like living organisms
at which point does do living organisms

4836
01:24:50,790 --> 01:24:50,800
at which point does do living organisms
 

4837
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,149
at which point does do living organisms
become living

4838
01:24:52,149 --> 01:24:52,159
become living
 

4839
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:54,950
become living
what like what how do you know

4840
01:24:54,950 --> 01:24:54,960
what like what how do you know
 

4841
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,550
what like what how do you know
if i give you a thing

4842
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:56,560
if i give you a thing
 

4843
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,790
if i give you a thing
that that thing is living and there's

4844
01:24:58,790 --> 01:24:58,800
that that thing is living and there's
 

4845
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,229
that that thing is living and there's
there's a lot of people working on this

4846
01:25:00,229 --> 01:25:00,239
there's a lot of people working on this
 

4847
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:02,870
there's a lot of people working on this
kind of idea and uh some of it has to do

4848
01:25:02,870 --> 01:25:02,880
kind of idea and uh some of it has to do
 

4849
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:05,270
kind of idea and uh some of it has to do
with the levels of complexity and so on

4850
01:25:05,270 --> 01:25:05,280
with the levels of complexity and so on
 

4851
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,189
with the levels of complexity and so on
it'd be nice to know like

4852
01:25:07,189 --> 01:25:07,199
it'd be nice to know like
 

4853
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:09,189
it'd be nice to know like
measuring different degrees of

4854
01:25:09,189 --> 01:25:09,199
measuring different degrees of
 

4855
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:11,669
measuring different degrees of
consciousness as you get into a bigger

4856
01:25:11,669 --> 01:25:11,679
consciousness as you get into a bigger
 

4857
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:13,990
consciousness as you get into a bigger
more and more complex objects

4858
01:25:13,990 --> 01:25:14,000
more and more complex objects
 

4859
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,270
more and more complex objects
and and that's i mean that's what

4860
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:15,280
and and that's i mean that's what
 

4861
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:17,110
and and that's i mean that's what
chemistry like bigger and bigger

4862
01:25:17,110 --> 01:25:17,120
chemistry like bigger and bigger
 

4863
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:18,790
chemistry like bigger and bigger
conscious molecules

4864
01:25:18,790 --> 01:25:18,800
conscious molecules
 

4865
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:21,510
conscious molecules
and to see how that leads to organisms

4866
01:25:21,510 --> 01:25:21,520
and to see how that leads to organisms
 

4867
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,510
and to see how that leads to organisms
and then organisms like start to

4868
01:25:23,510 --> 01:25:23,520
and then organisms like start to
 

4869
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,110
and then organisms like start to
collaborate together like they do inside

4870
01:25:25,110 --> 01:25:25,120
collaborate together like they do inside
 

4871
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,270
collaborate together like they do inside
our human body to create the full human

4872
01:25:27,270 --> 01:25:27,280
our human body to create the full human
 

4873
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,350
our human body to create the full human
body to do those kinds of experiments

4874
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:29,360
body to do those kinds of experiments
 

4875
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:30,470
body to do those kinds of experiments
would be

4876
01:25:30,470 --> 01:25:30,480
would be
 

4877
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,550
would be
that it seems like that would be kind of

4878
01:25:32,550 --> 01:25:32,560
that it seems like that would be kind of
 

4879
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:35,030
that it seems like that would be kind of
a goal that's what i mean by player in a

4880
01:25:35,030 --> 01:25:35,040
a goal that's what i mean by player in a
 

4881
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,470
a goal that's what i mean by player in a
game of physics

4882
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:36,480
game of physics
 

4883
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,310
game of physics
as opposed to like the base lay if it's

4884
01:25:38,310 --> 01:25:38,320
as opposed to like the base lay if it's
 

4885
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:41,590
as opposed to like the base lay if it's
just the base layer it becomes harder to

4886
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:41,600
just the base layer it becomes harder to
 

4887
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:43,590
just the base layer it becomes harder to
track it as you get from physics to

4888
01:25:43,590 --> 01:25:43,600
track it as you get from physics to
 

4889
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:47,110
track it as you get from physics to
chemistry to biology to psychology

4890
01:25:47,110 --> 01:25:47,120
chemistry to biology to psychology
 

4891
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:48,550
chemistry to biology to psychology
yeah

4892
01:25:48,550 --> 01:25:48,560
yeah
 

4893
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,430
yeah
in every case apart from consciousness i

01:25:51,430 --> 01:25:51,440
in every case apart from consciousness i
 

4895
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:54,229
in every case apart from consciousness i
would say what we're interested in is

4896
01:25:54,229 --> 01:25:54,239
would say what we're interested in is
 

4897
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:55,510
would say what we're interested in is
behavior

4898
01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:55,520
behavior
 

4899
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:57,189
behavior
uh we're interested in

4900
01:25:57,189 --> 01:25:57,199
uh we're interested in
 

4901
01:25:57,199 --> 01:25:59,270
uh we're interested in
explaining behavioral functions it's at

4902
01:25:59,270 --> 01:25:59,280
explaining behavioral functions it's at
 

4903
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,550
explaining behavioral functions it's at
the level of fundamental physics we're

4904
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:00,560
the level of fundamental physics we're
 

4905
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:02,390
the level of fundamental physics we're
interested in capturing the equations

4906
01:26:02,390 --> 01:26:02,400
interested in capturing the equations
 

4907
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,470
interested in capturing the equations
that describe the behavior there

4908
01:26:04,470 --> 01:26:04,480
that describe the behavior there
 

4909
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,550
that describe the behavior there
and when we get to higher levels we're

4910
01:26:06,550 --> 01:26:06,560
and when we get to higher levels we're
 

4911
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:09,669
and when we get to higher levels we're
interested in explicating the behavior

4912
01:26:09,669 --> 01:26:09,679
interested in explicating the behavior
 

4913
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:11,910
interested in explicating the behavior
perhaps in terms of behavior at simpler

4914
01:26:11,910 --> 01:26:11,920
perhaps in terms of behavior at simpler
 

4915
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:13,830
perhaps in terms of behavior at simpler
levels

4916
01:26:13,830 --> 01:26:13,840
levels
 

4917
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:15,510
levels
and with life as well that's what we're

4918
01:26:15,510 --> 01:26:15,520
and with life as well that's what we're
 

4919
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:17,270
and with life as well that's what we're
interested in the various

4920
01:26:17,270 --> 01:26:17,280
interested in the various
 

4921
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:19,590
interested in the various
observable functions of of life

4922
01:26:19,590 --> 01:26:19,600
observable functions of of life
 

4923
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,430
observable functions of of life
explaining them in terms of

01:26:21,430 --> 01:26:21,440
explaining them in terms of
 

4925
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,830
explaining them in terms of
more more simple mechanisms but in the

4926
01:26:23,830 --> 01:26:23,840
more more simple mechanisms but in the
 

4927
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:26,470
more more simple mechanisms but in the

case of consciousness
 

4929
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,070

i don't think that's what we're doing or

i don't think that's what we're doing or

in the case of consciousness
 

4937
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:36,550
in the case of consciousness
there are these subjective qualities

4938
01:26:36,550 --> 01:26:36,560
there are these subjective qualities

does not deal with that so i think we've
 

4955
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:53,350

um
 

5007
01:27:40,159 --> 01:27:41,350
um
but i think there's this radical

5008
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:41,360
but i think there's this radical
 

5009
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:44,390

complex behavior and the way you do that
 

5021
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:55,350
complex behavior and the way you do that
is

5022
01:27:55,350 --> 01:27:55,360
is
 

5023
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,830
is
identify mechanisms simpler mechanisms

that explicate that behavior that that's

01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:06,950
neurobiology um
but in the case of consciousness that's

5032
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:06,960
but in the case of consciousness that's
 

5033
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,149
but in the case of consciousness that's
not what we're trying to do we're trying

01:28:08,149 --> 01:28:08,159
not what we're trying to do we're trying
 

5035
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:09,750
not what we're trying to do we're trying
to account for these

5036
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:09,760
to account for these
 

5037
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:12,830
to account for these
subjective qualities and you postulate a

5038
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:12,840
subjective qualities and you postulate a
 

5039
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:15,030
subjective qualities and you postulate a
mechanism that that might explain

5040
01:28:15,030 --> 01:28:15,040
mechanism that that might explain
 

5041
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:17,110
mechanism that that might explain
behavior but it doesn't explain

5042
01:28:17,110 --> 01:28:17,120
behavior but it doesn't explain
 

5043
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:21,270
behavior but it doesn't explain
the redness of a red experience so um

5044
01:28:21,270 --> 01:28:21,280
the redness of a red experience so um
 

5045
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:23,030
the redness of a red experience so um
but still i mean still ultimately the

5046
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:23,040
but still i mean still ultimately the
 

5047
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,149
but still i mean still ultimately the
hope is

5048
01:28:24,149 --> 01:28:24,159
hope is
 

5049
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:25,430
hope is
that we will have some kind of

5050
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:25,440
that we will have some kind of
 

5051
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,430
that we will have some kind of
hierarchical story so

5052
01:28:27,430 --> 01:28:27,440
hierarchical story so
 

5053
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,910
hierarchical story so
we take the causal dynamics of physics

5054
01:28:29,910 --> 01:28:29,920
we take the causal dynamics of physics
 

5055
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:32,070
we take the causal dynamics of physics
we hypothesize that that's filled out

5056
01:28:32,070 --> 01:28:32,080
we hypothesize that that's filled out
 

5057
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:32,790
we hypothesize that that's filled out
with

5058
01:28:32,790 --> 01:28:32,800
with
 

5059
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,470
with
uh

5060
01:28:34,470 --> 01:28:34,480
uh
 

5061
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:36,629
uh
certain forms of consciousness and then

5062
01:28:36,629 --> 01:28:36,639
certain forms of consciousness and then
 

5063
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:39,270
certain forms of consciousness and then
at higher levels we get

5064
01:28:39,270 --> 01:28:39,280
at higher levels we get
 

5065
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:42,310
at higher levels we get
more complex causal dynamics filled out

5066
01:28:42,310 --> 01:28:42,320
more complex causal dynamics filled out
 

5067
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:44,310
more complex causal dynamics filled out
by more complex forms of consciousness

5068
01:28:44,310 --> 01:28:44,320
by more complex forms of consciousness
 

5069
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:47,270
by more complex forms of consciousness
and ultimately we get to um

5070
01:28:47,270 --> 01:28:47,280
and ultimately we get to um
 

5071
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,270
and ultimately we get to um
others hopefully so yeah so there's

5072
01:28:49,270 --> 01:28:49,280
others hopefully so yeah so there's
 

5073
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:51,270
others hopefully so yeah so there's
still a sort of hierarchical explanatory

5074
01:28:51,270 --> 01:28:51,280
still a sort of hierarchical explanatory
 

5075
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:53,430
still a sort of hierarchical explanatory
framework there

5076
01:28:53,430 --> 01:28:53,440
framework there
 

5077
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:55,110
framework there
so you kind of mentioned the hierarchy

5078
01:28:55,110 --> 01:28:55,120
so you kind of mentioned the hierarchy
 

5079
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:56,950
so you kind of mentioned the hierarchy
of consciousness

5080
01:28:56,950 --> 01:28:56,960
of consciousness
 

5081
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:58,310
of consciousness
do you think it's

5082
01:28:58,310 --> 01:28:58,320
do you think it's
 

5083
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:01,510
do you think it's
possible to uh within the pan cyclist

5084
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:01,520
possible to uh within the pan cyclist
 

5085
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:04,790
possible to uh within the pan cyclist

5089
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:11,910
consciousness or put another way are
some things more conscious than others

5090
01:29:11,910 --> 01:29:11,920

 

5091
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:15,590

5093
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,070

it's a difficult question i i mean

01:29:18,070 --> 01:29:18,080
it's a difficult question i i mean
 

5095
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:21,830
it's a difficult question i i mean
i do see consciousness as a

don't think you can answer that because

don't think you can answer that because

01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,350
don't think you can answer that because

at the level at which there is most

you know probably
this cup of tea isn't conscious because

this cup of tea isn't conscious because

01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:31,910
this cup of tea isn't conscious because
there's probably more integrated

what is distinctive about the brain is

what is distinctive about the brain is
 

5175
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:41,750
what is distinctive about the brain is
that

that
 

5177
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:43,270
that
there's a huge amount of integrated

01:30:43,270 --> 01:30:43,280
there's a huge amount of integrated
 

5179
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:45,510
there's a huge amount of integrated
there's more integrated information in

01:30:45,510 --> 01:30:45,520
there's more integrated information in

01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:47,510
there's more integrated information in

they

they
so i don't i mean i like some features

5194

so i don't i mean i like some features
 

5195
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:00,229
so i don't i mean i like some features
of this theory but they do

of this theory but they do
 

5197
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:01,590
of this theory but they do
talk about

5198
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:01,600
talk about
 

5199
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:03,350
talk about
degrees of consciousness they do want to

01:31:03,350 --> 01:31:03,360
degrees of consciousness they do want to
 

5201
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:06,310
degrees of consciousness they do want to
say there is gradations

5202
01:31:06,310 --> 01:31:06,320
say there is gradations
 

5203
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,470
say there is gradations
i'm not sure conceptually i

5204
01:31:08,470 --> 01:31:08,480
i'm not sure conceptually i
 

5205
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:10,870
i'm not sure conceptually i
i can kind of make sense of that i mean

5206
01:31:10,870 --> 01:31:10,880
i can kind of make sense of that i mean
 

5207
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:13,350
i can kind of make sense of that i mean
we can there are things

5208
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:13,360
we can there are things
 

5209
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:15,270
we can there are things
to do with consciousness that are graded

5210
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:15,280
to do with consciousness that are graded
 

5211
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:16,229
to do with consciousness that are graded
like

5212
01:31:16,229 --> 01:31:16,239
like
 

5213
01:31:16,239 --> 01:31:20,229
like
complexity or

but i'm not sure whether experience

but i'm not sure whether experience
itself

itself
 

5221
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:28,390

admits a degree i sort of think

01:31:28,390 --> 01:31:28,400
admits a degree i sort of think

01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,070
admits a degree i sort of think
something either has experience or it

5224
01:31:30,070 --> 01:31:30,080
something either has experience or it
 

5225
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,910
something either has experience or it
doesn't uh it might have very simple

5226
01:31:31,910 --> 01:31:31,920
doesn't uh it might have very simple
 

5227
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,350
doesn't uh it might have very simple
experience it might have a very complex

5228
01:31:33,350 --> 01:31:33,360
experience it might have a very complex
 

5229
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:36,870
experience it might have a very complex
experience but

5230
01:31:36,870 --> 01:31:36,880

 

5231
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:39,030

experience itself i don't think it

5232
01:31:39,030 --> 01:31:39,040
experience itself i don't think it
 

5233
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:41,750
experience itself i don't think it
admits a degree in that sense it's not

5234
01:31:41,750 --> 01:31:41,760
admits a degree in that sense it's not
 

5235
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:43,590
admits a degree in that sense it's not
more experience

5236
01:31:43,590 --> 01:31:43,600
more experience
 

5237
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,430
more experience
less experience i sort of find that

5238
01:31:45,430 --> 01:31:45,440
less experience i sort of find that
 

5239
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:47,590
less experience i sort of find that
conceptually hard to make sense of but

5240
01:31:47,590 --> 01:31:47,600
conceptually hard to make sense of but
 

5241
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:51,430
conceptually hard to make sense of but
i'm not i'm kind of open-minded on it

5242
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:51,440

 

5243
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:54,149

so when we have a lot higher resolution

5244
01:31:54,149 --> 01:31:54,159
so when we have a lot higher resolution
 

5245
01:31:54,159 --> 01:31:55,669
so when we have a lot higher resolution
of

5246
01:31:55,669 --> 01:31:55,679
of
 

5247
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:56,830
of
sensory

5248
01:31:56,830 --> 01:31:56,840
sensory
 

5249
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:58,629
sensory
information

5250
01:31:58,629 --> 01:31:58,639
information
 

5251
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:01,990
information
don't you think that's correlated to um

5252
01:32:01,990 --> 01:32:02,000
don't you think that's correlated to um
 

5253
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,430
don't you think that's correlated to um
the richness of the experience so more

5254
01:32:05,430 --> 01:32:05,440
the richness of the experience so more
 

5255
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,590
the richness of the experience so more
doesn't more information provide a

5256
01:32:07,590 --> 01:32:07,600
doesn't more information provide a
 

5257
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:10,229
doesn't more information provide a
richer experience or is that again

5258
01:32:10,229 --> 01:32:10,239
richer experience or is that again
 

5259
01:32:10,239 --> 01:32:12,470
richer experience or is that again
thinking quantitatively and not thinking

5260
01:32:12,470 --> 01:32:12,480
thinking quantitatively and not thinking
 

5261
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:14,390
thinking quantitatively and not thinking
about the subjective experience like you

5262
01:32:14,390 --> 01:32:14,400
about the subjective experience like you
 

5263
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:17,110
about the subjective experience like you
can experience a lot with very little

5264
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:17,120
can experience a lot with very little
 

5265
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:20,310
can experience a lot with very little
sensory information perhaps

5266
01:32:20,310 --> 01:32:20,320
sensory information perhaps
 

5267
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:22,709
sensory information perhaps
like do you think those are connected

5268
01:32:22,709 --> 01:32:22,719
like do you think those are connected
 

5269
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:25,430
like do you think those are connected
yeah yeah so there are there are

5270
01:32:25,430 --> 01:32:25,440
yeah yeah so there are there are
 

5271
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:27,590
yeah yeah so there are there are
features characteristics here we

5272
01:32:27,590 --> 01:32:27,600
features characteristics here we
 

5273
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:29,750
features characteristics here we
we can grade the

5274
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:29,760
we can grade the
 

5275
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:32,950
we can grade the
complexity of the experience

5276
01:32:32,950 --> 01:32:32,960
complexity of the experience
 

5277
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:33,910
complexity of the experience
um

5278
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:33,920
um
 

5279
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:36,709
um
and on the integrated information theory

5280
01:32:36,709 --> 01:32:36,719
and on the integrated information theory
 

5281
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:38,070
and on the integrated information theory
uh

5282
01:32:38,070 --> 01:32:38,080
uh
 

5283
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:40,950
uh
they they correlate that in

5284
01:32:40,950 --> 01:32:40,960
they they correlate that in
 

5285
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:43,350
they they correlate that in
in terms of mathematically identifiable

5286
01:32:43,350 --> 01:32:43,360
in terms of mathematically identifiable
 

5287
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:44,709
in terms of mathematically identifiable
structure with

5288
01:32:44,709 --> 01:32:44,719
structure with
 

5289
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:46,790
structure with
integrated information so roughly it's a

5290
01:32:46,790 --> 01:32:46,800
integrated information so roughly it's a
 

5291
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,790
integrated information so roughly it's a
quite unusual notion of information it's

5292
01:32:48,790 --> 01:32:48,800
quite unusual notion of information it's
 

5293
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:50,950
quite unusual notion of information it's
perhaps not the standard way

5294
01:32:50,950 --> 01:32:50,960
perhaps not the standard way
 

5295
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:53,189
perhaps not the standard way
one thinks about information it's it's

5296
01:32:53,189 --> 01:32:53,199
one thinks about information it's it's
 

5297
01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:56,070
one thinks about information it's it's
to do with constraining

5298
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:56,080
to do with constraining
 

5299
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:58,229
to do with constraining
past and future possibilities of the

5300
01:32:58,229 --> 01:32:58,239
past and future possibilities of the
 

5301
01:32:58,239 --> 01:32:59,189
past and future possibilities of the
system

5302
01:32:59,189 --> 01:32:59,199
system
 

5303
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:01,350
system
so the idea is in in the retina of the

5304
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:01,360
so the idea is in in the retina of the
 

5305
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:03,590
so the idea is in in the retina of the
eye there's a huge amount of

5306
01:33:03,590 --> 01:33:03,600
eye there's a huge amount of
 

5307
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:04,629
eye there's a huge amount of
possible

5308
01:33:04,629 --> 01:33:04,639
possible
 

5309
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:06,790
possible
states my the retina of my eye could be

5310
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:06,800
states my the retina of my eye could be
 

5311
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,709
states my the retina of my eye could be
in at the next moment depending on what

5312
01:33:08,709 --> 01:33:08,719
in at the next moment depending on what
 

5313
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:11,350
in at the next moment depending on what
light goes into it

5314
01:33:11,350 --> 01:33:11,360
light goes into it
 

5315
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:13,270
light goes into it
whereas the possible next states of the

5316
01:33:13,270 --> 01:33:13,280
whereas the possible next states of the
 

5317
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:14,950
whereas the possible next states of the
brain are much more constrained

5318
01:33:14,950 --> 01:33:14,960
brain are much more constrained
 

5319
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:17,189
brain are much more constrained
obviously it responds to the environment

5320
01:33:17,189 --> 01:33:17,199
obviously it responds to the environment
 

5321
01:33:17,199 --> 01:33:18,550
obviously it responds to the environment
but

5322
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:18,560
but
 

5323
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:20,790
but
it heavily constrains

5324
01:33:20,790 --> 01:33:20,800
it heavily constrains
 

5325
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:23,590
it heavily constrains
uh it's it's past and future states

5326
01:33:23,590 --> 01:33:23,600
uh it's it's past and future states
 

5327
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:25,669
uh it's it's past and future states
and so that's the idea of information

5328
01:33:25,669 --> 01:33:25,679
and so that's the idea of information
 

5329
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:27,830
and so that's the idea of information
they have and then

5330
01:33:27,830 --> 01:33:27,840
they have and then
 

5331
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:30,709
they have and then
the second idea is how much that that

5332
01:33:30,709 --> 01:33:30,719
the second idea is how much that that
 

5333
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:33,430
the second idea is how much that that
that information is dependent on

5334
01:33:33,430 --> 01:33:33,440
that information is dependent on
 

5335
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:36,149
that information is dependent on
integration so in you know in a computer

5336
01:33:36,149 --> 01:33:36,159
integration so in you know in a computer
 

5337
01:33:36,159 --> 01:33:39,750
integration so in you know in a computer
we have transistors um you take out a

5338
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:39,760
we have transistors um you take out a
 

5339
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:41,430
we have transistors um you take out a
few transistors you might not lose that

5340
01:33:41,430 --> 01:33:41,440
few transistors you might not lose that
 

5341
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,910
few transistors you might not lose that
much information it's not dependent on

5342
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:43,920
much information it's not dependent on
 

5343
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:45,750
much information it's not dependent on
interconnections whereas you take a tiny

5344
01:33:45,750 --> 01:33:45,760
interconnections whereas you take a tiny
 

5345
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:47,270
interconnections whereas you take a tiny
bit of the brain out you lose a lot of

5346
01:33:47,270 --> 01:33:47,280
bit of the brain out you lose a lot of
 

5347
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:48,790
bit of the brain out you lose a lot of
information because the way it stores

5348
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:48,800
information because the way it stores
 

5349
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:52,070
information because the way it stores
information is is dependent on

5350
01:33:52,070 --> 01:33:52,080
information is is dependent on
 

5351
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,310
information is is dependent on
the interconnections of the system

5352
01:33:54,310 --> 01:33:54,320
the interconnections of the system
 

5353
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:57,030
the interconnections of the system
so yeah so that's one proposal for how

5354
01:33:57,030 --> 01:33:57,040
so yeah so that's one proposal for how
 

5355
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:57,910
so yeah so that's one proposal for how
to

5356
01:33:57,910 --> 01:33:57,920
to
 

5357
01:33:57,920 --> 01:33:59,030
to
measure

5358
01:33:59,030 --> 01:33:59,040
measure
 

5359
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:01,030
measure
one

5360
01:34:01,030 --> 01:34:01,040
one

01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:03,350
one
gradeable characteristic which might

5362
01:34:03,350 --> 01:34:03,360
gradeable characteristic which might

01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:05,110
gradeable characteristic which might
correspond to some gradable

5364
01:34:05,110 --> 01:34:05,120
correspond to some gradable
 

5365
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:06,790
correspond to some gradable
characteristic in qualitative

consciousness um and maybe i'm being

01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:10,629

very pedantic which is you know

5370
01:34:10,629 --> 01:34:10,639
very pedantic which is you know
 

5371
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:12,709
very pedantic which is you know
philosophers professional pedants i just

5372
01:34:12,709 --> 01:34:12,719
philosophers professional pedants i just
 

5373
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:14,470
philosophers professional pedants i just
sort of don't think that

5374
01:34:14,470 --> 01:34:14,480
sort of don't think that
 

5375
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:15,830
sort of don't think that
is

5376
01:34:15,830 --> 01:34:15,840
is
 

5377
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:17,350
is
a quantity

5378
01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:17,360
a quantity
 

5379
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:21,110
a quantity
of experience it's a quantity of

5380
01:34:21,110 --> 01:34:21,120
of experience it's a quantity of
 

5381
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:23,830
of experience it's a quantity of
the structure of experience maybe but

5382
01:34:23,830 --> 01:34:23,840
the structure of experience maybe but
 

5383
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,189
the structure of experience maybe but
i just find it hard to make sense the

5384
01:34:25,189 --> 01:34:25,199
i just find it hard to make sense the
 

5385
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:27,350
i just find it hard to make sense the
idea of how much experience do you have

5386
01:34:27,350 --> 01:34:27,360
idea of how much experience do you have
 

5387
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:28,470
idea of how much experience do you have
i've got

5388

one university i don't know i find that
uh

5396
01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:35,840
uh
 

5397
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:37,669
uh
a bit hard to make sense well but maybe

5398
01:34:37,669 --> 01:34:37,679
a bit hard to make sense well but maybe
 

5399
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:39,590
a bit hard to make sense well but maybe
i'm being just pedantic i think just

5400
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:39,600
i'm being just pedantic i think just
 

5401
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:41,510
i'm being just pedantic i think just
saying the word experience

5402
01:34:41,510 --> 01:34:41,520
saying the word experience
 

5403
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:44,070
saying the word experience
is is difficult

5404
01:34:44,070 --> 01:34:44,080
is is difficult
 

5405
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:46,149
is is difficult
uh to think about let's talk about

5406
01:34:46,149 --> 01:34:46,159
uh to think about let's talk about
 

5407
01:34:46,159 --> 01:34:47,350
uh to think about let's talk about
suffering

5408
01:34:47,350 --> 01:34:47,360
suffering
 

5409
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:49,910
suffering
let's talk a particular experience

5410
01:34:49,910 --> 01:34:49,920
let's talk a particular experience
 

5411
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:51,910
let's talk a particular experience
so let's talk about me

5412
01:34:51,910 --> 01:34:51,920
so let's talk about me
 

5413
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:53,910
so let's talk about me
and a hamster

and a hamster
 

5415
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:56,550
and a hamster

5417
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:58,550
yeah i just think that
no offense to the hamster

5418
01:34:58,550 --> 01:34:58,560
no offense to the hamster
 

5419
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:01,030
no offense to the hamster

has less capacity to suffer than me

5456
01:35:41,990 --> 01:35:42,000
has less capacity to suffer than me
 

5457
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:46,709
has less capacity to suffer than me
and maybe a a cockroach or an insect

5458
01:35:46,709 --> 01:35:46,719
and maybe a a cockroach or an insect
 

5459
01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:49,990
and maybe a a cockroach or an insect
or maybe a bacteria has less capacity to

suffer
 

5463
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:53,590
suffer
than me

5464
01:35:53,590 --> 01:35:53,600
than me
 

5465
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,430
than me
but is that

5466
01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:55,440
but is that
 

5467
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:58,149
but is that
maybe that's me deluding myself

5468
01:35:58,149 --> 01:35:58,159
maybe that's me deluding myself
 

5469
01:35:58,159 --> 01:36:00,229
maybe that's me deluding myself
as to the complexity of my conscious

5470
01:36:00,229 --> 01:36:00,239
as to the complexity of my conscious
 

5471
01:36:00,239 --> 01:36:01,590
as to the complexity of my conscious
experience

5472
01:36:01,590 --> 01:36:01,600
experience
 

5473
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:04,149
experience
maybe it's all like it's uh

5474
01:36:04,149 --> 01:36:04,159
maybe it's all like it's uh
 

5475
01:36:04,159 --> 01:36:06,870
maybe it's all like it's uh
maybe there is some sense in which i can

5476
01:36:06,870 --> 01:36:06,880
maybe there is some sense in which i can
 

5477
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:09,270
maybe there is some sense in which i can
suffer more

5478
01:36:09,270 --> 01:36:09,280
suffer more
 

5479
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:11,030
suffer more
but to reduce it to something

5480
01:36:11,030 --> 01:36:11,040
but to reduce it to something
 

5481
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:14,950
but to reduce it to something
quantifiable is uh is impossible

5482
01:36:14,950 --> 01:36:14,960
quantifiable is uh is impossible
 

5483
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:16,709
quantifiable is uh is impossible
yeah i guess i definitely think there's

5484
01:36:16,709 --> 01:36:16,719
yeah i guess i definitely think there's
 

5485
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:19,590
yeah i guess i definitely think there's
kinds of suffering that

5486
01:36:19,590 --> 01:36:19,600
kinds of suffering that

um
concern about whether there's a purpose

5510
01:36:42,550 --> 01:36:42,560
concern about whether there's a purpose
 

5511
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:44,149
concern about whether there's a purpose
to existence

5512
01:36:44,149 --> 01:36:44,159
to existence
 

5513
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:46,390
to existence
these are forms of um

5514
01:36:46,390 --> 01:36:46,400
these are forms of um
 

5515
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,390
these are forms of um
suffering that aren't available to

suffering that aren't available to
 

5517
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:51,750
suffering that aren't available to
certain to most non-human animals

5518
01:36:51,750 --> 01:36:51,760
certain to most non-human animals
 

5519
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:54,470
certain to most non-human animals
whether there's a an overall

5520
01:36:54,470 --> 01:36:54,480
whether there's a an overall
 

5521
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:56,550
whether there's a an overall
scale that we could put physical and

5522
01:36:56,550 --> 01:36:56,560
scale that we could put physical and
 

5523
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:00,070
scale that we could put physical and
emotional suffering on and um

5524
01:37:00,070 --> 01:37:00,080
emotional suffering on and um
 

5525
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:03,590
emotional suffering on and um
identify where you are on that scale um

5526
01:37:03,590 --> 01:37:03,600
identify where you are on that scale um
 

5527
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:05,030
identify where you are on that scale um
i'm not sure

5528
01:37:05,030 --> 01:37:05,040
i'm not sure
 

5529
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:07,590
i'm not sure
so it's like humans have a much bigger

5530
01:37:07,590 --> 01:37:07,600
so it's like humans have a much bigger
 

5531
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:08,790
so it's like humans have a much bigger
menu

5532
01:37:08,790 --> 01:37:08,800
menu
 

5533
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:10,470
menu
of experiences

5534
01:37:10,470 --> 01:37:10,480
of experiences
 

5535
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:11,910
of experiences
much bigger

5536
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:11,920
much bigger
 

5537
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:14,629
much bigger
selection in the in one sense at least

5538
01:37:14,629 --> 01:37:14,639
selection in the in one sense at least
 

5539
01:37:14,639 --> 01:37:16,950
selection in the in one sense at least
so there's like a page that's suffering

5540
01:37:16,950 --> 01:37:16,960
so there's like a page that's suffering
 

5541

5547
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:25,910
breakfast and so on and one of the pages
is suffering it's just we have a lot

01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:31,590
compared to uh to a hamster a lot more
but any one individual thing that we

5552
01:37:31,590 --> 01:37:31,600
but any one individual thing that we
 

5553
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:33,669
but any one individual thing that we
share with a hamster

5554
01:37:33,669 --> 01:37:33,679
share with a hamster
 

5555
01:37:33,679 --> 01:37:35,669
share with a hamster
that experience

5556
01:37:35,669 --> 01:37:35,679
that experience
 

5557
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:37,350
that experience
it's difficult to argue that we

5558
01:37:37,350 --> 01:37:37,360
it's difficult to argue that we
 

5559
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:39,590
it's difficult to argue that we
experience it deeper than others like

5560
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:39,600
experience it deeper than others like
 

5561
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,750
experience it deeper than others like
hunger or something like that yeah

5562
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:41,760
hunger or something like that yeah
 

5563
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:44,229
hunger or something like that yeah
physical pain i'm not sure

5564
01:37:44,229 --> 01:37:44,239
physical pain i'm not sure
 

5565
01:37:44,239 --> 01:37:45,830
physical pain i'm not sure
um but i mean there are kinds of

5566
01:37:45,830 --> 01:37:45,840
um but i mean there are kinds of
 

5567
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:47,669
um but i mean there are kinds of
experiences animals have that we don't

5568
01:37:47,669 --> 01:37:47,679
experiences animals have that we don't
 

5569
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:51,030
experiences animals have that we don't
bats echo locate around the world

5570
01:37:51,030 --> 01:37:51,040
bats echo locate around the world
 

5571
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:52,310
bats echo locate around the world
uh

5572
01:37:52,310 --> 01:37:52,320
uh
 

5573
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:54,470
uh
the philosopher thomas nagle famously

5574
01:37:54,470 --> 01:37:54,480
the philosopher thomas nagle famously
 

5575
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:56,470
the philosopher thomas nagle famously
pointed out that you know no matter how

5576
01:37:56,470 --> 01:37:56,480
pointed out that you know no matter how
 

5577
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,430
pointed out that you know no matter how
much you understand of the

5578
01:37:57,430 --> 01:37:57,440
much you understand of the
 

5579
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:59,990
much you understand of the
neurophysiology of bats you'll still not

5580
01:37:59,990 --> 01:38:00,000
neurophysiology of bats you'll still not
 

5581
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,790
neurophysiology of bats you'll still not
know what it's like to

5582
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:02,800
know what it's like to
 

5583
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:05,350
know what it's like to
squeal and find your way around by

5584
01:38:05,350 --> 01:38:05,360
squeal and find your way around by
 

5585
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:07,910
squeal and find your way around by
listening to the uh the echoes bounce

5586
01:38:07,910 --> 01:38:07,920
listening to the uh the echoes bounce
 

5587
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:10,390
listening to the uh the echoes bounce
off so

5588
01:38:10,390 --> 01:38:10,400
off so
 

5589
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:12,149
off so
yeah i mean i i guess i feel the

5590
01:38:12,149 --> 01:38:12,159
yeah i mean i i guess i feel the
 

5591
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:15,189
yeah i mean i i guess i feel the
intuition that there's um

5592
01:38:15,189 --> 01:38:15,199
intuition that there's um
 

5593
01:38:15,199 --> 01:38:17,109
intuition that there's um
emotional suffering is i want to say

5594
01:38:17,109 --> 01:38:17,119
emotional suffering is i want to say
 

5595
01:38:17,119 --> 01:38:19,830
emotional suffering is i want to say
deeper than physical suffering

5596
01:38:19,830 --> 01:38:19,840
deeper than physical suffering
 

5597
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:22,070
deeper than physical suffering
i don't know how to make that statement

5598
01:38:22,070 --> 01:38:22,080
i don't know how to make that statement
 

5599
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:24,709
i don't know how to make that statement
precise though so one of the ways i

5600
01:38:24,709 --> 01:38:24,719
precise though so one of the ways i
 

5601
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:26,390
precise though so one of the ways i
think about i think people think about

5602
01:38:26,390 --> 01:38:26,400
think about i think people think about
 

5603
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:28,550
think about i think people think about
consciousness is in connection to

5604
01:38:28,550 --> 01:38:28,560
consciousness is in connection to
 

5605
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:29,830
consciousness is in connection to
suffering so

5606
01:38:29,830 --> 01:38:29,840
suffering so
 

5607
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:32,229
suffering so
let me just ask about suffering because

5608
01:38:32,229 --> 01:38:32,239
let me just ask about suffering because
 

5609
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:34,950
let me just ask about suffering because
that's how people think about animals

5610
01:38:34,950 --> 01:38:34,960
that's how people think about animals
 

5611
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:37,109
that's how people think about animals
cruelty to animals or cruelty to living

5612
01:38:37,109 --> 01:38:37,119
cruelty to animals or cruelty to living
 

5613
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:38,629
cruelty to animals or cruelty to living
things

5614
01:38:38,629 --> 01:38:38,639
things
 

5615
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:40,470
things
they connect that

5616
01:38:40,470 --> 01:38:40,480
they connect that
 

5617
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:42,870
they connect that
to suffering into consciousness

5618
01:38:42,870 --> 01:38:42,880
to suffering into consciousness
 

5619
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:45,030
to suffering into consciousness
i think

5620
01:38:45,030 --> 01:38:45,040
i think
 

5621
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:46,790
i think
there's a sense in which those are two

5622
01:38:46,790 --> 01:38:46,800
there's a sense in which those are two
 

5623
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:49,669
there's a sense in which those are two
are deeply connected when people are

5624
01:38:49,669 --> 01:38:49,679
are deeply connected when people are
 

5625
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:52,470
are deeply connected when people are
are thinking about just

5626
01:38:52,470 --> 01:38:52,480
are thinking about just
 

5627
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:55,270
are thinking about just
uh public policy they're thinking about

5628
01:38:55,270 --> 01:38:55,280
uh public policy they're thinking about
 

5629
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:58,229
uh public policy they're thinking about
this like philosophy engineering

5630
01:38:58,229 --> 01:38:58,239
this like philosophy engineering
 

5631
01:38:58,239 --> 01:39:01,510
this like philosophy engineering
psychology sociology

5632
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:01,520
psychology sociology
 

5633
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:03,510
psychology sociology
political science all of those things

5634
01:39:03,510 --> 01:39:03,520
political science all of those things
 

5635
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:05,430
political science all of those things
have to do with human suffering and

5636
01:39:05,430 --> 01:39:05,440
have to do with human suffering and
 

5637
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:07,510
have to do with human suffering and
animal suffering life suffering

5638
01:39:07,510 --> 01:39:07,520
animal suffering life suffering
 

5639
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:09,990
animal suffering life suffering
and that's connected to consciousness in

5640
01:39:09,990 --> 01:39:10,000
and that's connected to consciousness in
 

5641
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,830
and that's connected to consciousness in
a lot of people's minds is it connected

5642
01:39:11,830 --> 01:39:11,840
a lot of people's minds is it connected
 

5643
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:14,070
a lot of people's minds is it connected
like that for you so

5644
01:39:14,070 --> 01:39:14,080
like that for you so
 

5645
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:15,270
like that for you so
the

5646
01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:15,280
the
 

5647
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:18,149
the
the capacity to suffer is it also is it

5648
01:39:18,149 --> 01:39:18,159
the capacity to suffer is it also is it
 

5649
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:20,229
the capacity to suffer is it also is it
also somehow like strongly correlated

5650
01:39:20,229 --> 01:39:20,239
also somehow like strongly correlated
 

5651
01:39:20,239 --> 01:39:21,750
also somehow like strongly correlated
with

5652
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:21,760
with
 

5653
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:24,149
with
the capacity to experience

5654
01:39:24,149 --> 01:39:24,159
the capacity to experience
 

5655
01:39:24,159 --> 01:39:25,510
the capacity to experience
yeah i would say

5656
01:39:25,510 --> 01:39:25,520
yeah i would say
 

5657
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:26,629
yeah i would say
i would say

5658
01:39:26,629 --> 01:39:26,639
i would say
 

5659
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:30,709
i would say
suffering is a kind of experience and so

5660
01:39:30,709 --> 01:39:30,719
suffering is a kind of experience and so
 

5661
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:33,590
suffering is a kind of experience and so
you have to be conscious to suffer

5662
01:39:33,590 --> 01:39:33,600
you have to be conscious to suffer
 

5663
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:34,790
you have to be conscious to suffer
um

5664
01:39:34,790 --> 01:39:34,800
um
 

5665
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:37,109
um
actually there's so there

5666
01:39:37,109 --> 01:39:37,119
actually there's so there
 

5667
01:39:37,119 --> 01:39:39,910
actually there's so there
as well people taking more unusual views

5668
01:39:39,910 --> 01:39:39,920
as well people taking more unusual views
 

5669
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:42,390
as well people taking more unusual views
of consciousness seriously now um

5670
01:39:42,390 --> 01:39:42,400
of consciousness seriously now um
 

5671
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:45,270
of consciousness seriously now um
pan psychism is is is one radical

5672
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:45,280
pan psychism is is is one radical
 

5673
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,430
pan psychism is is is one radical
approach another one is what's become

5674
01:39:47,430 --> 01:39:47,440
approach another one is what's become
 

5675
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:48,390
approach another one is what's become
known as

5676
01:39:48,390 --> 01:39:48,400
known as
 

5677
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:51,270
known as
illusionism the view that uh

5678
01:39:51,270 --> 01:39:51,280
illusionism the view that uh
 

5679
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:52,709
illusionism the view that uh
consciousness at least in the sense that

5680
01:39:52,709 --> 01:39:52,719
consciousness at least in the sense that
 

5681
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:54,310
consciousness at least in the sense that
philosophers think about it doesn't

5682
01:39:54,310 --> 01:39:54,320
philosophers think about it doesn't
 

5683
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:56,070
philosophers think about it doesn't
really exist at all

5684
01:39:56,070 --> 01:39:56,080
really exist at all
 

5685
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:57,910
really exist at all
so yeah my

5686
01:39:57,910 --> 01:39:57,920
so yeah my
 

5687
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:01,350
so yeah my
podcast mind chat i i host with a

5688
01:40:01,350 --> 01:40:01,360
podcast mind chat i i host with a
 

5689
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:03,669
podcast mind chat i i host with a
a committed illusionist so the gimmick

5690
01:40:03,669 --> 01:40:03,679
a committed illusionist so the gimmick
 

5691
01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:05,750
a committed illusionist so the gimmick
is i think consciousness is everywhere

5692
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:05,760
is i think consciousness is everywhere
 

5693
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,510
is i think consciousness is everywhere
he thinks it's nowhere

5694
01:40:07,510 --> 01:40:07,520
he thinks it's nowhere
 

5695
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:08,790
he thinks it's nowhere
and um

5696
01:40:08,790 --> 01:40:08,800
and um
 

5697
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:09,830
and um
so

5698
01:40:09,830 --> 01:40:09,840
so
 

5699
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:11,510
so
so that's one very simple way of

5700
01:40:11,510 --> 01:40:11,520
so that's one very simple way of
 

5701
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:13,990
so that's one very simple way of
avoiding all these problems right

5702
01:40:13,990 --> 01:40:14,000
avoiding all these problems right
 

5703
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,590
avoiding all these problems right
if consciousness doesn't exist we don't

5704
01:40:15,590 --> 01:40:15,600
if consciousness doesn't exist we don't
 

5705
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:17,830
if consciousness doesn't exist we don't
need to explain it job done

5706
01:40:17,830 --> 01:40:17,840
need to explain it job done
 

5707
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:20,149
need to explain it job done
although we might still have to explain

5708
01:40:20,149 --> 01:40:20,159
although we might still have to explain
 

5709
01:40:20,159 --> 01:40:22,310
although we might still have to explain
why we seem to be conscious why it's so

5710
01:40:22,310 --> 01:40:22,320
why we seem to be conscious why it's so
 

5711
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:23,669
why we seem to be conscious why it's so
hard to get out of the idea that we're

5712
01:40:23,669 --> 01:40:23,679
hard to get out of the idea that we're
 

5713
01:40:23,679 --> 01:40:25,270
hard to get out of the idea that we're
conscious but that

5714
01:40:25,270 --> 01:40:25,280
conscious but that

01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:01,669
so i'm inclined to think you know
consciousness

5878
01:43:01,669 --> 01:43:01,679
consciousness
 

5879
01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:03,669
consciousness
is the basis

5880
01:43:03,669 --> 01:43:03,679
is the basis
 

5881
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:04,790
is the basis
of

5882
01:43:04,790 --> 01:43:04,800

for this reason i think it can transform

01:43:14,470 --> 01:43:14,480
for this reason i think it can transform
 

5889
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:16,070
for this reason i think it can transform
your relationship with nature if you

5890
01:43:16,070 --> 01:43:16,080
your relationship with nature if you
 

5891
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:16,870
your relationship with nature if you
think of

5892
01:43:16,870 --> 01:43:16,880
think of
 

5893
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:18,390
think of
a tree as

5894
01:43:18,390 --> 01:43:18,400
a tree as
 

5895
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,629
a tree as
a conscious organism albeit of a very

unusual kind
 

5899
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:25,030
unusual kind
then a tree is a a

5900
01:43:25,030 --> 01:43:25,040
then a tree is a a
 

5901
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:27,510
then a tree is a a
locus of

5902
01:43:27,510 --> 01:43:27,520
locus of
 

5903
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:29,590
locus of
moral concern in its own right chopping

5904
01:43:29,590 --> 01:43:29,600
moral concern in its own right chopping
 

5905
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:31,350
moral concern in its own right chopping
down a tree is an act of immediate moral

5906
01:43:31,350 --> 01:43:31,360
down a tree is an act of immediate moral
 

5907
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:32,950
down a tree is an act of immediate moral
concern if you see these

5908
01:43:32,950 --> 01:43:32,960
concern if you see these
 

5909
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:34,870
concern if you see these
you know horrible

5910
01:43:34,870 --> 01:43:34,880
you know horrible

forest fires

5912
01:43:36,550 --> 01:43:36,560
forest fires
 

5913
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:38,070
forest fires
we're all horrified but if you think

5914
01:43:38,070 --> 01:43:38,080
we're all horrified but if you think
 

5915
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:40,709
we're all horrified but if you think
it's the burning of conscious organisms

5916
01:43:40,709 --> 01:43:40,719
it's the burning of conscious organisms
 

5917
01:43:40,719 --> 01:43:42,550
it's the burning of conscious organisms
that does add

5918
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:42,560
that does add
 

5919
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:44,709
that does add
a whole new dimension although it also

5920
01:43:44,709 --> 01:43:44,719
a whole new dimension although it also
 

5921
01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:46,950
a whole new dimension although it also
makes things more complicated because

5922
01:43:46,950 --> 01:43:46,960
makes things more complicated because
 

5923
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:48,550
makes things more complicated because
people often think as a pan cyclist i'm

5924
01:43:48,550 --> 01:43:48,560
people often think as a pan cyclist i'm
 

5925
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:49,669
people often think as a pan cyclist i'm
gonna be

5926
01:43:49,669 --> 01:43:49,679
gonna be
 

5927
01:43:49,679 --> 01:43:51,430
gonna be
vegan but

5928
01:43:51,430 --> 01:43:51,440
vegan but
 

5929
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:53,830
vegan but
it's tricky because if you think plants

5930
01:43:53,830 --> 01:43:53,840
it's tricky because if you think plants
 

5931
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:55,270
it's tricky because if you think plants
and trees are conscious as well you've

5932
01:43:55,270 --> 01:43:55,280
and trees are conscious as well you've
 

5933
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:57,109
and trees are conscious as well you've
got to eat something if you if you don't

5934
01:43:57,109 --> 01:43:57,119
got to eat something if you if you don't
 

5935
01:43:57,119 --> 01:43:58,870
got to eat something if you if you don't
think plants and trees are conscious

5936
01:43:58,870 --> 01:43:58,880
think plants and trees are conscious
 

5937
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:00,629
think plants and trees are conscious
then you've got a nice moral dividing

5938
01:44:00,629 --> 01:44:00,639
then you've got a nice moral dividing
 

5939
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:02,310
then you've got a nice moral dividing
line you can say i'm not going to eat

5940
01:44:02,310 --> 01:44:02,320
line you can say i'm not going to eat
 

5941
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:03,430
line you can say i'm not going to eat
things that aren't conscious i'm not

5942
01:44:03,430 --> 01:44:03,440
things that aren't conscious i'm not
 

5943
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:05,350
things that aren't conscious i'm not
going to kill things unconscious

5944
01:44:05,350 --> 01:44:05,360
going to kill things unconscious
 

5945
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:07,030
going to kill things unconscious
but if you think

5946
01:44:07,030 --> 01:44:07,040
but if you think
 

5947
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:09,910
but if you think
plants and trees are conscious then

5948
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:09,920
plants and trees are conscious then
 

5949
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:11,669
plants and trees are conscious then
you don't have that nice moral dividing

5950
01:44:11,669 --> 01:44:11,679
you don't have that nice moral dividing
 

5951
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:13,510
you don't have that nice moral dividing
line i mean so the the principle i'm

5952
01:44:13,510 --> 01:44:13,520
line i mean so the the principle i'm
 

5953
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:14,950
line i mean so the the principle i'm
kind of

5954
01:44:14,950 --> 01:44:14,960
kind of
 

5955
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:16,790
kind of
working my way towards i haven't kept it

5956
01:44:16,790 --> 01:44:16,800
working my way towards i haven't kept it
 

5957
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:19,510
working my way towards i haven't kept it
up in it's in my trip to the us but

5958
01:44:19,510 --> 01:44:19,520
up in it's in my trip to the us but
 

5959
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:20,870
up in it's in my trip to the us but
is just

5960
01:44:20,870 --> 01:44:20,880
is just
 

5961
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:22,470
is just
not eating any animal products that are

5962
01:44:22,470 --> 01:44:22,480
not eating any animal products that are
 

5963
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:24,390
not eating any animal products that are
factory farmed

5964
01:44:24,390 --> 01:44:24,400
factory farmed
 

5965
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:25,830
factory farmed
you know my vegan friends say well are

5966
01:44:25,830 --> 01:44:25,840
you know my vegan friends say well are
 

5967
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:27,510
you know my vegan friends say well are
still suffering there and i think there

5968
01:44:27,510 --> 01:44:27,520
still suffering there and i think there
 

5969
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:30,470
still suffering there and i think there
is even in the even in the um the nicest

5970
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:30,480
is even in the even in the um the nicest
 

5971
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:32,790
is even in the even in the um the nicest
farms

5972
01:44:32,790 --> 01:44:32,800
farms
 

5973
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:34,870
farms
cows will suffer when their cows when

5974
01:44:34,870 --> 01:44:34,880
cows will suffer when their cows when
 

5975
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:36,470
cows will suffer when their cows when
their calves are taken off them they go

5976
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:36,480
their calves are taken off them they go
 

5977
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:38,629
their calves are taken off them they go
for a few days of quite serious morning

5978
01:44:38,629 --> 01:44:38,639
for a few days of quite serious morning
 

5979
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:39,990
for a few days of quite serious morning
so they're still suffering but it seems

5980
01:44:39,990 --> 01:44:40,000
so they're still suffering but it seems
 

5981
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,109
so they're still suffering but it seems
to me

5982
01:44:41,109 --> 01:44:41,119
to me
 

5983
01:44:41,119 --> 01:44:42,629
to me
my thought is

5984
01:44:42,629 --> 01:44:42,639
my thought is
 

5985
01:44:42,639 --> 01:44:44,310
my thought is
the principle

5986
01:44:44,310 --> 01:44:44,320
the principle
 

5987
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,470
the principle
of just not having factory farm stuff is

5988
01:44:46,470 --> 01:44:46,480
of just not having factory farm stuff is
 

5989
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:48,310
of just not having factory farm stuff is
something more people could get on board

5990
01:44:48,310 --> 01:44:48,320
something more people could get on board
 

5991
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:50,470
something more people could get on board
with and you might have greater harm

5992
01:44:50,470 --> 01:44:50,480
with and you might have greater harm
 

5993
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:51,990
with and you might have greater harm
minimization so if people went into

5994
01:44:51,990 --> 01:44:52,000
minimization so if people went into
 

5995
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,510
minimization so if people went into
restaurants and said

5996
01:44:53,510 --> 01:44:53,520
restaurants and said
 

5997
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:55,750
restaurants and said
are your animal products factory farmed

5998
01:44:55,750 --> 01:44:55,760
are your animal products factory farmed
 

5999
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:57,430
are your animal products factory farmed
if not

6000
01:44:57,430 --> 01:44:57,440
if not
 

6001
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:58,950
if not
i want the vegan option or if people

6002
01:44:58,950 --> 01:44:58,960
i want the vegan option or if people
 

6003
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:01,189
i want the vegan option or if people
looked out for the label that said no

6004
01:45:01,189 --> 01:45:01,199
looked out for the label that said no
 

6005
01:45:01,199 --> 01:45:02,790
looked out for the label that said no
factory farmed ingredients you know i

6006
01:45:02,790 --> 01:45:02,800
factory farmed ingredients you know i
 

6007
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:04,470
factory farmed ingredients you know i
think maybe that that could make a

6008
01:45:04,470 --> 01:45:04,480
think maybe that that could make a
 

6009
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:06,629
think maybe that that could make a
really big difference to the market and

6010
01:45:06,629 --> 01:45:06,639
really big difference to the market and
 

6011
01:45:06,639 --> 01:45:09,990
really big difference to the market and
harm minimization anyway so that's the

6012
01:45:09,990 --> 01:45:10,000
harm minimization anyway so that's the
 

6013
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,070
harm minimization anyway so that's the
so it's very ethically tricky but um but

6014
01:45:12,070 --> 01:45:12,080
so it's very ethically tricky but um but
 

6015
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:13,189
so it's very ethically tricky but um but
some people don't buy that there's a

6016
01:45:13,189 --> 01:45:13,199
some people don't buy that there's a
 

6017
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:14,870
some people don't buy that there's a

as philosophers normally think of it in
 

6085
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:23,510
as philosophers normally think of it in
conventional scientific terms so we

6086
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:23,520
conventional scientific terms so we
 

6087
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:25,430
conventional scientific terms so we
serve that starting point

6088
01:46:25,430 --> 01:46:25,440
serve that starting point
 

6089
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:27,030
serve that starting point
but we we react to it in very different

have to rethink what science is so you

6102
01:46:39,830 --> 01:46:39,840
have to rethink what science is so you
 

6103

some
pretty bad philosophy so uh i think we

6188

pretty bad philosophy so uh i think we
 

6189
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:12,310
pretty bad philosophy so uh i think we
have to do philosophy

6190
01:48:12,310 --> 01:48:12,320
have to do philosophy
 

6191
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:14,310
have to do philosophy
if only to get rid of bad philosophy you

6192
01:48:14,310 --> 01:48:14,320
if only to get rid of bad philosophy you
 

6193
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:16,830
if only to get rid of bad philosophy you
know you can't you can't escape but

6199
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,149
had a debate on on clubhouse a pan
psychism debate together with annika

6200
01:48:26,149 --> 01:48:26,159
psychism debate together with annika
 

6201
01:48:26,159 --> 01:48:29,030
psychism debate together with annika
harris and owen fleming oh wow

6202
01:48:29,030 --> 01:48:29,040
harris and owen fleming oh wow
 

6203
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:30,070
harris and owen fleming oh wow
there's a

6204
01:48:30,070 --> 01:48:30,080
there's a
 

6205
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:33,270
there's a
two people on each team and uh it was

6206
01:48:33,270 --> 01:48:33,280
two people on each team and uh it was
 

6207
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:35,669
two people on each team and uh it was
the most popular thing on clubhouse

6208
01:48:35,669 --> 01:48:35,679
the most popular thing on clubhouse
 

6209
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:37,109
the most popular thing on clubhouse
at that time

6210
01:48:37,109 --> 01:48:37,119
at that time
 

6211
01:48:37,119 --> 01:48:38,390
at that time
um

6212
01:48:38,390 --> 01:48:38,400
um
 

6213
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:39,510
um
so

6214
01:48:39,510 --> 01:48:39,520
so
 

6215
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:41,990
so
yeah so he's he's a he's a

6216
01:48:41,990 --> 01:48:42,000
yeah so he's he's a he's a
 

6217
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,830
yeah so he's he's a he's a
a materialist

6218
01:48:43,830 --> 01:48:43,840
a materialist
 

6219
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:46,950
a materialist
of a pretty standard kind that um

6220
01:48:46,950 --> 01:48:46,960
of a pretty standard kind that um
 

6221
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:48,709
of a pretty standard kind that um
consciousness is understood as a sort of

6222
01:48:48,709 --> 01:48:48,719
consciousness is understood as a sort of
 

6223
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:50,550
consciousness is understood as a sort of
emergent feature it's not not adding

6224
01:48:50,550 --> 01:48:50,560
emergent feature it's not not adding
 

6225
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:53,189
emergent feature it's not not adding
anything a weekly emergent feature

6226
01:48:53,189 --> 01:48:53,199
anything a weekly emergent feature
 

6227
01:48:53,199 --> 01:48:54,629
anything a weekly emergent feature
but what i guess what we've been

6228
01:48:54,629 --> 01:48:54,639
but what i guess what we've been
 

6229
01:48:54,639 --> 01:48:58,950
but what i guess what we've been
debating most about is is whether

6230
01:48:58,950 --> 01:48:58,960

 

6231
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:01,590

my view can account for mental causation

6232
01:49:01,590 --> 01:49:01,600
my view can account for mental causation
 

6233
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:03,590
my view can account for mental causation
for the fact that consciousness is doing

6234
01:49:03,590 --> 01:49:03,600
for the fact that consciousness is doing
 

6235
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:05,109
for the fact that consciousness is doing
stuff

6236
01:49:05,109 --> 01:49:05,119
stuff
 

6237
01:49:05,119 --> 01:49:08,229
stuff
so he thinks the fact that

6238
01:49:08,229 --> 01:49:08,239
so he thinks the fact that
 

6239
01:49:08,239 --> 01:49:10,950
so he thinks the fact that
i think zombies are logically coherent

6240
01:49:10,950 --> 01:49:10,960
i think zombies are logically coherent
 

6241
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:12,950
i think zombies are logically coherent
it's logic there's a it's logically

6242
01:49:12,950 --> 01:49:12,960
it's logic there's a it's logically
 

6243
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:14,390
it's logic there's a it's logically
coherent

6244
01:49:14,390 --> 01:49:14,400
coherent
 

6245
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:16,709
coherent
for there to be a world physically just

6246
01:49:16,709 --> 01:49:16,719
for there to be a world physically just
 

6247
01:49:16,719 --> 01:49:18,070
for there to be a world physically just
like ours

6248
01:49:18,070 --> 01:49:18,080
like ours
 

6249
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:20,470
like ours
in which there's no consciousness

6250
01:49:20,470 --> 01:49:20,480
in which there's no consciousness
 

6251
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:22,070
in which there's no consciousness
he thinks that shows oh my view

6252
01:49:22,070 --> 01:49:22,080
he thinks that shows oh my view
 

6253
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:23,270
he thinks that shows oh my view
consciousness doesn't do anything it

6254
01:49:23,270 --> 01:49:23,280
consciousness doesn't do anything it
 

6255
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:24,870
consciousness doesn't do anything it
doesn't add anything

6256
01:49:24,870 --> 01:49:24,880
doesn't add anything
 

6257
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:27,109
doesn't add anything
which is crazy you know my my

6258
01:49:27,109 --> 01:49:27,119
which is crazy you know my my
 

6259
01:49:27,119 --> 01:49:29,430
which is crazy you know my my
my consciousness impacts on the world my

6260
01:49:29,430 --> 01:49:29,440
my consciousness impacts on the world my
 

6261
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:31,669
my consciousness impacts on the world my
conscious thoughts are causing me to say

6262
01:49:31,669 --> 01:49:31,679
conscious thoughts are causing me to say
 

6263
01:49:31,679 --> 01:49:33,510
conscious thoughts are causing me to say
the words i'm saying now my

6264
01:49:33,510 --> 01:49:33,520
the words i'm saying now my
 

6265
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:36,390
the words i'm saying now my
visual experience helps me get navigate

6266
01:49:36,390 --> 01:49:36,400
visual experience helps me get navigate
 

6267
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:37,589
visual experience helps me get navigate
the world

6268
01:49:37,589 --> 01:49:37,599
the world
 

6269
01:49:37,599 --> 01:49:38,550
the world
but

6270
01:49:38,550 --> 01:49:38,560
but
 

6271
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:41,669
but
i mean my response to sean carroll is is

6272
01:49:41,669 --> 01:49:41,679
i mean my response to sean carroll is is
 

6273
01:49:41,679 --> 01:49:43,669
i mean my response to sean carroll is is
on the panzerkist view the relationship

6274
01:49:43,669 --> 01:49:43,679
on the panzerkist view the relationship
 

6275
01:49:43,679 --> 01:49:45,430
on the panzerkist view the relationship
between

6276
01:49:45,430 --> 01:49:45,440
between
 

6277
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:47,750
between
physics and

6278
01:49:47,750 --> 01:49:47,760
physics and
 

6279
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:49,669
physics and
fundamental consciousness

6280
01:49:49,669 --> 01:49:49,679
fundamental consciousness
 

6281
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:51,189
fundamental consciousness
is is a sort of like the relationship

6282
01:49:51,189 --> 01:49:51,199
is is a sort of like the relationship
 

6283
01:49:51,199 --> 01:49:57,109
is is a sort of like the relationship
between software and hardware right uh

6284
01:49:57,109 --> 01:49:57,119
between software and hardware right uh
 

6285
01:49:57,119 --> 01:49:59,350
between software and hardware right uh
physics is sort of the software and

6286
01:49:59,350 --> 01:49:59,360
physics is sort of the software and
 

6287
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:01,589
physics is sort of the software and
consciousness is the hardware

6288
01:50:01,589 --> 01:50:01,599
consciousness is the hardware
 

6289
01:50:01,599 --> 01:50:03,669
consciousness is the hardware
so um

6290
01:50:03,669 --> 01:50:03,679
so um
 

6291
01:50:03,679 --> 01:50:05,350
so um
consciousness at the fundamental level

6292
01:50:05,350 --> 01:50:05,360
consciousness at the fundamental level
 

6293
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:07,510
consciousness at the fundamental level
is the hardware on which the software of

6294
01:50:07,510 --> 01:50:07,520
is the hardware on which the software of
 

6295
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:09,669
is the hardware on which the software of
physics runs

6296
01:50:09,669 --> 01:50:09,679
physics runs
 

6297
01:50:09,679 --> 01:50:11,750
physics runs
and just because you know

6298
01:50:11,750 --> 01:50:11,760
and just because you know
 

6299
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:13,589
and just because you know
just because a certain bit of software

6300
01:50:13,589 --> 01:50:13,599
just because a certain bit of software
 

6301
01:50:13,599 --> 01:50:15,589
just because a certain bit of software
could run on two different kinds of

6302
01:50:15,589 --> 01:50:15,599
could run on two different kinds of
 

6303
01:50:15,599 --> 01:50:17,030
could run on two different kinds of
hardware it doesn't mean the hardware

6304
01:50:17,030 --> 01:50:17,040
hardware it doesn't mean the hardware
 

6305
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:18,310
hardware it doesn't mean the hardware
isn't doing anything the fact that

6306
01:50:18,310 --> 01:50:18,320
isn't doing anything the fact that
 

6307
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:20,470
isn't doing anything the fact that
microsoft word can run on your desktop

6308
01:50:20,470 --> 01:50:20,480
microsoft word can run on your desktop
 

6309
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:22,550
microsoft word can run on your desktop
and run on your laptop doesn't mean your

6310
01:50:22,550 --> 01:50:22,560
and run on your laptop doesn't mean your
 

6311
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:24,950
and run on your laptop doesn't mean your
desktop isn't doing anything similarly

6312
01:50:24,950 --> 01:50:24,960
desktop isn't doing anything similarly
 

6313
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:26,310
desktop isn't doing anything similarly
just because

6314
01:50:26,310 --> 01:50:26,320
just because
 

6315
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:28,070
just because
there could be another universe in which

6316
01:50:28,070 --> 01:50:28,080
there could be another universe in which
 

6317
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:30,629
there could be another universe in which
the physics is realized in non-conscious

6318
01:50:30,629 --> 01:50:30,639
the physics is realized in non-conscious
 

6319
01:50:30,639 --> 01:50:31,669
the physics is realized in non-conscious
stuff

6320
01:50:31,669 --> 01:50:31,679
stuff
 

6321
01:50:31,679 --> 01:50:33,350
stuff
it doesn't mean the consciousness in our

6322
01:50:33,350 --> 01:50:33,360
it doesn't mean the consciousness in our
 

6323
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:34,709
it doesn't mean the consciousness in our
universe

6324
01:50:34,709 --> 01:50:34,719
universe
 

6325
01:50:34,719 --> 01:50:36,149
universe
isn't doing stuff you know for the pan

6326
01:50:36,149 --> 01:50:36,159
isn't doing stuff you know for the pan
 

6327
01:50:36,159 --> 01:50:39,270
isn't doing stuff you know for the pan
cyclist all there is is consciousness so

6328
01:50:39,270 --> 01:50:39,280
cyclist all there is is consciousness so
 

6329
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:42,149
cyclist all there is is consciousness so
if something's doing something it is

6330
01:50:42,149 --> 01:50:42,159
if something's doing something it is
 

6331
01:50:42,159 --> 01:50:44,149
if something's doing something it is
in your view it's not emergent

6332
01:50:44,149 --> 01:50:44,159
in your view it's not emergent
 

6333
01:50:44,159 --> 01:50:46,149
in your view it's not emergent
and uh

6334
01:50:46,149 --> 01:50:46,159
and uh
 

6335
01:50:46,159 --> 01:50:49,750
and uh
more than that it's doing quite a lot

6336
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:49,760
more than that it's doing quite a lot
 

6337
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:51,109
more than that it's doing quite a lot
it's doing everything is the only thing

6338
01:50:51,109 --> 01:50:51,119
it's doing everything is the only thing
 

6339
01:50:51,119 --> 01:50:53,589
it's doing everything is the only thing
that exists yeah but it's

6340
01:50:53,589 --> 01:50:53,599
that exists yeah but it's
 

6341
01:50:53,599 --> 01:50:54,709
that exists yeah but it's
so

6342
01:50:54,709 --> 01:50:54,719
so
 

6343
01:50:54,719 --> 01:50:55,669
so
you know

6344
01:50:55,669 --> 01:50:55,679
you know
 

6345
01:50:55,679 --> 01:50:57,589
you know
the ground

6346
01:50:57,589 --> 01:50:57,599
the ground
 

6347
01:50:57,599 --> 01:51:00,310
the ground
is as important because we walk on it

6348
01:51:00,310 --> 01:51:00,320
is as important because we walk on it
 

6349
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:02,310
is as important because we walk on it
it's like holding stuff up but it's not

6350
01:51:02,310 --> 01:51:02,320
it's like holding stuff up but it's not
 

6351
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:04,629
it's like holding stuff up but it's not
really doing that much

6352
01:51:04,629 --> 01:51:04,639
really doing that much
 

6353
01:51:04,639 --> 01:51:07,589
really doing that much
yeah uh but it feels like consciousness

6354
01:51:07,589 --> 01:51:07,599
yeah uh but it feels like consciousness
 

6355
01:51:07,599 --> 01:51:09,750
yeah uh but it feels like consciousness
is doing quite a lot it's doing quite a

6356
01:51:09,750 --> 01:51:09,760
is doing quite a lot it's doing quite a
 

6357
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:11,030
is doing quite a lot it's doing quite a
lot of work

6358
01:51:11,030 --> 01:51:11,040
lot of work
 

6359
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:12,310
lot of work
and uh

6360
01:51:12,310 --> 01:51:12,320
and uh
 

6361
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:16,390
and uh
sort of interacting with the environment

6362
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:16,400
sort of interacting with the environment
 

6363
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:18,709
sort of interacting with the environment
it feels like consciousness is not just

6364
01:51:18,709 --> 01:51:18,719
it feels like consciousness is not just
 

6365
01:51:18,719 --> 01:51:22,149
it feels like consciousness is not just
a

6366
01:51:22,149 --> 01:51:22,159

 

6367
01:51:22,159 --> 01:51:22,950

like

6368
01:51:22,950 --> 01:51:22,960
like
 

6369
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:24,709
like
if you remove consciousness it's not

6370
01:51:24,709 --> 01:51:24,719
if you remove consciousness it's not
 

6371
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:27,030
if you remove consciousness it's not
just that you remove

6372
01:51:27,030 --> 01:51:27,040
just that you remove
 

6373
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:29,189
just that you remove
the experience of things

6374
01:51:29,189 --> 01:51:29,199
the experience of things
 

6375
01:51:29,199 --> 01:51:31,350
the experience of things
it feels like you're also going to

6376
01:51:31,350 --> 01:51:31,360
it feels like you're also going to
 

6377
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:33,189
it feels like you're also going to
remove a lot of the progress of human

6378
01:51:33,189 --> 01:51:33,199
remove a lot of the progress of human
 

6379
01:51:33,199 --> 01:51:35,830
remove a lot of the progress of human
civilization in society and and all that

6380
01:51:35,830 --> 01:51:35,840
civilization in society and and all that
 

6381
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:37,990
civilization in society and and all that
it just feels like consciousness has a

6382
01:51:37,990 --> 01:51:38,000
it just feels like consciousness has a
 

6383
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,550
it just feels like consciousness has a
lot of uh

6384
01:51:40,550 --> 01:51:40,560
lot of uh
 

6385
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:43,510
lot of uh
value in how we develop our society so

6386
01:51:43,510 --> 01:51:43,520
value in how we develop our society so
 

6387
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:45,270
value in how we develop our society so
from everything you said with suffering

6388
01:51:45,270 --> 01:51:45,280
from everything you said with suffering
 

6389
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:48,709
from everything you said with suffering
with morality yeah with motivation with

6390
01:51:48,709 --> 01:51:48,719
with morality yeah with motivation with
 

6391
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:51,510
with morality yeah with motivation with
uh love and fear and all of those kinds

6392
01:51:51,510 --> 01:51:51,520
uh love and fear and all of those kinds
 

6393
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:54,070
uh love and fear and all of those kinds
of things it seems like it's it's uh

6394
01:51:54,070 --> 01:51:54,080
of things it seems like it's it's uh
 

6395
01:51:54,080 --> 01:51:56,709
of things it seems like it's it's uh
consciousness in all different flavors

6396
01:51:56,709 --> 01:51:56,719
consciousness in all different flavors
 

6397
01:51:56,719 --> 01:51:59,430
consciousness in all different flavors
and ways is part of all of that

6398
01:51:59,430 --> 01:51:59,440
and ways is part of all of that
 

6399
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:01,510
and ways is part of all of that
and so without it

6400
01:52:01,510 --> 01:52:01,520
and so without it
 

6401
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:03,910
and so without it
you're you may not have a human

6402
01:52:03,910 --> 01:52:03,920
you're you may not have a human
 

6403
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:05,350
you're you may not have a human
civilization at all

6404
01:52:05,350 --> 01:52:05,360
civilization at all
 

6405
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:07,109
civilization at all
so it's doing a lot of work because

6406
01:52:07,109 --> 01:52:07,119
so it's doing a lot of work because
 

6407
01:52:07,119 --> 01:52:11,109
so it's doing a lot of work because
causality causality-wise and in in

6408
01:52:11,109 --> 01:52:11,119
causality causality-wise and in in
 

6409
01:52:11,119 --> 01:52:13,030
causality causality-wise and in in
every kind of way of course when you go

6410
01:52:13,030 --> 01:52:13,040
every kind of way of course when you go
 

6411
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:14,790
every kind of way of course when you go
to the physics level it starts to say

6412
01:52:14,790 --> 01:52:14,800
to the physics level it starts to say
 

6413
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:15,669
to the physics level it starts to say
okay

6414
01:52:15,669 --> 01:52:15,679
okay
 

6415
01:52:15,679 --> 01:52:19,189
okay
how much maybe the work consciousness is

6416
01:52:19,189 --> 01:52:19,199
how much maybe the work consciousness is
 

6417
01:52:19,199 --> 01:52:20,390
how much maybe the work consciousness is
doing

6418
01:52:20,390 --> 01:52:20,400
doing
 

6419
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:23,030
doing
is uh higher at some levels of reality

6420
01:52:23,030 --> 01:52:23,040
is uh higher at some levels of reality
 

6421
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:24,550
is uh higher at some levels of reality
than others

6422
01:52:24,550 --> 01:52:24,560
than others
 

6423
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:26,950
than others
maybe a lot of the work it's doing is

6424
01:52:26,950 --> 01:52:26,960
maybe a lot of the work it's doing is
 

6425
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:30,070
maybe a lot of the work it's doing is
most apparent at the human level when

6426
01:52:30,070 --> 01:52:30,080
most apparent at the human level when
 

6427
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:32,790
most apparent at the human level when
you have at the complex organism level

6428
01:52:32,790 --> 01:52:32,800
you have at the complex organism level
 

6429
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:35,669
you have at the complex organism level
maybe it's quite boring like maybe this

6430
01:52:35,669 --> 01:52:35,679
maybe it's quite boring like maybe this
 

6431
01:52:35,679 --> 01:52:38,229
maybe it's quite boring like maybe this
the stuff of uh like physics is more

6432
01:52:38,229 --> 01:52:38,239
the stuff of uh like physics is more
 

6433
01:52:38,239 --> 01:52:41,510
the stuff of uh like physics is more
important at the formation of uh

6434
01:52:41,510 --> 01:52:41,520
important at the formation of uh
 

6435
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:43,589
important at the formation of uh
at this formation of stars and all that

6436
01:52:43,589 --> 01:52:43,599
at this formation of stars and all that
 

6437
01:52:43,599 --> 01:52:45,430
at this formation of stars and all that
kind of stuff consciousness only starts

6438
01:52:45,430 --> 01:52:45,440
kind of stuff consciousness only starts
 

6439
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:47,189
kind of stuff consciousness only starts
being important when you have greater

6440
01:52:47,189 --> 01:52:47,199
being important when you have greater
 

6441
01:52:47,199 --> 01:52:51,189
being important when you have greater
complexities of uh of organism yeah my

6442
01:52:51,189 --> 01:52:51,199
complexities of uh of organism yeah my
 

6443
01:52:51,199 --> 01:52:53,589
complexities of uh of organism yeah my
consciousness is complicated and fairly

6444
01:52:53,589 --> 01:52:53,599
consciousness is complicated and fairly
 

6445
01:52:53,599 --> 01:52:55,350
consciousness is complicated and fairly
complicated

6446
01:52:55,350 --> 01:52:55,360
complicated
 

6447
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:56,950
complicated
and

6448
01:52:56,950 --> 01:52:56,960
and
 

6449
01:52:56,960 --> 01:52:59,109
and
i as a result it does complicated things

6450
01:52:59,109 --> 01:52:59,119
i as a result it does complicated things
 

6451
01:52:59,119 --> 01:53:01,350
i as a result it does complicated things
the consciousness of a particle is

6452
01:53:01,350 --> 01:53:01,360
the consciousness of a particle is
 

6453
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:03,189
the consciousness of a particle is
very simple and hence it behaves in

6454
01:53:03,189 --> 01:53:03,199
very simple and hence it behaves in
 

6455
01:53:03,199 --> 01:53:07,669
very simple and hence it behaves in
predictable ways but the but the idea is

6456
01:53:07,669 --> 01:53:07,679

 

6457
01:53:07,679 --> 01:53:09,669

the con the particle

6458
01:53:09,669 --> 01:53:09,679
the con the particle
 

6459
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:11,589
the con the particle
its entire nature is

6460
01:53:11,589 --> 01:53:11,599
its entire nature is
 

6461
01:53:11,599 --> 01:53:12,870
its entire nature is
constituted of its forms of

6462
01:53:12,870 --> 01:53:12,880
constituted of its forms of
 

6463
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:14,950
constituted of its forms of
consciousness and it does what it does

6464
01:53:14,950 --> 01:53:14,960
consciousness and it does what it does
 

6465
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:17,030
consciousness and it does what it does
because of those experiences it's just

6466
01:53:17,030 --> 01:53:17,040
because of those experiences it's just
 

6467
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:18,950
because of those experiences it's just
that when we when we do physics we're

6468
01:53:18,950 --> 01:53:18,960
that when we when we do physics we're
 

6469
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:20,550
that when we when we do physics we're
not interested in what stuff is we're

6470
01:53:20,550 --> 01:53:20,560
not interested in what stuff is we're
 

6471
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:22,550
not interested in what stuff is we're
just interested in what it does so

6472
01:53:22,550 --> 01:53:22,560
just interested in what it does so
 

6473
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:25,830
just interested in what it does so
physics abstracts away from the stuff of

6474
01:53:25,830 --> 01:53:25,840
physics abstracts away from the stuff of
 

6475
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:28,070
physics abstracts away from the stuff of
the world and just

6476
01:53:28,070 --> 01:53:28,080
the world and just
 

6477
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:29,669
the world and just
describes it

6478
01:53:29,669 --> 01:53:29,679
describes it
 

6479
01:53:29,679 --> 01:53:30,709
describes it
into

6480
01:53:30,709 --> 01:53:30,719
into
 

6481
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:32,550
into
in terms of its mathematical causal

6482
01:53:32,550 --> 01:53:32,560
in terms of its mathematical causal
 

6483
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:35,030
in terms of its mathematical causal
structure um

6484
01:53:35,030 --> 01:53:35,040
structure um
 

6485
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:36,070
structure um
so

6486
01:53:36,070 --> 01:53:36,080
so
 

6487
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:37,910
so
yeah but it's still on the panzer's view

6488
01:53:37,910 --> 01:53:37,920
yeah but it's still on the panzer's view
 

6489
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:39,750
yeah but it's still on the panzer's view
it's consciousness that's doing stuff

6490
01:53:39,750 --> 01:53:39,760
it's consciousness that's doing stuff
 

6491
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:40,550
it's consciousness that's doing stuff
yeah

6492
01:53:40,550 --> 01:53:40,560
yeah
 

6493
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:42,390
yeah
i gotta ask you

6494
01:53:42,390 --> 01:53:42,400
i gotta ask you
 

6495
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:45,510
i gotta ask you
because you kind of said you know

6496
01:53:45,510 --> 01:53:45,520
because you kind of said you know
 

6497
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:50,229
because you kind of said you know
there is some value

6498
01:53:50,229 --> 01:53:50,239

 

6499
01:53:50,239 --> 01:53:52,070

in consciousness helping us understand

6500
01:53:52,070 --> 01:53:52,080
in consciousness helping us understand
 

6501
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:57,030
in consciousness helping us understand
morality and a philosophical zombie

6502
01:53:57,030 --> 01:53:57,040
morality and a philosophical zombie
 

6503
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:57,830
morality and a philosophical zombie
is

6504
01:53:57,830 --> 01:53:57,840
is
 

6505
01:53:57,840 --> 01:53:59,350
is
somebody that

6506
01:53:59,350 --> 01:53:59,360
somebody that
 

6507
01:53:59,360 --> 01:54:00,470
somebody that
you know

6508
01:54:00,470 --> 01:54:00,480
you know
 

6509
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:03,189
you know
you're more okay how do i phrase it

6510
01:54:03,189 --> 01:54:03,199
you're more okay how do i phrase it
 

6511
01:54:03,199 --> 01:54:05,270
you're more okay how do i phrase it
that's not like

6512
01:54:05,270 --> 01:54:05,280
that's not like
 

6513
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:08,390
that's not like
accusing you of stuff but

6514
01:54:08,390 --> 01:54:08,400
accusing you of stuff but
 

6515
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:09,910
accusing you of stuff but
in your view

6516
01:54:09,910 --> 01:54:09,920
in your view
 

6517
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:12,629
in your view
it's more okay to murder a philosophical

6518
01:54:12,629 --> 01:54:12,639
it's more okay to murder a philosophical
 

6519
01:54:12,639 --> 01:54:13,589
it's more okay to murder a philosophical
zombie

6520
01:54:13,589 --> 01:54:13,599
zombie
 

6521
01:54:13,599 --> 01:54:16,070
zombie
than it is a human being

6522
01:54:16,070 --> 01:54:16,080
than it is a human being
 

6523
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:17,510
than it is a human being
yeah i wouldn't even call it murder

6524
01:54:17,510 --> 01:54:17,520
yeah i wouldn't even call it murder
 

6525
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:20,070
yeah i wouldn't even call it murder
maybe but you're right exactly turn off

6526
01:54:20,070 --> 01:54:20,080
maybe but you're right exactly turn off
 

6527
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:21,350
maybe but you're right exactly turn off
the power

6528
01:54:21,350 --> 01:54:21,360
the power
 

6529
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:23,750
the power
into the philosophical zombie the source

6530
01:54:23,750 --> 01:54:23,760
into the philosophical zombie the source
 

6531
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:25,270
into the philosophical zombie the source
of energy

6532
01:54:25,270 --> 01:54:25,280
of energy
 

6533
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:28,550
of energy
yeah so here comes then the question

6534
01:54:28,550 --> 01:54:28,560
yeah so here comes then the question
 

6535
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:30,310
yeah so here comes then the question
we kind of talked about this offline a

6536
01:54:30,310 --> 01:54:30,320
we kind of talked about this offline a
 

6537
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:32,470
we kind of talked about this offline a
little bit

6538
01:54:32,470 --> 01:54:32,480
little bit
 

6539
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:34,709
little bit
so i think that there is something

6540
01:54:34,709 --> 01:54:34,719
so i think that there is something
 

6541
01:54:34,719 --> 01:54:37,350
so i think that there is something
special about consciousness

6542
01:54:37,350 --> 01:54:37,360
special about consciousness
 

6543
01:54:37,360 --> 01:54:39,990
special about consciousness
and you know i'm very open-minded about

6544
01:54:39,990 --> 01:54:40,000
and you know i'm very open-minded about
 

6545
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:40,870
and you know i'm very open-minded about
where

6546
01:54:40,870 --> 01:54:40,880
where
 

6547
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:42,870
where
the special comes from whether it's the

6548
01:54:42,870 --> 01:54:42,880
the special comes from whether it's the
 

6549
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:45,430
the special comes from whether it's the
fundamental base of all reality

6550
01:54:45,430 --> 01:54:45,440
fundamental base of all reality
 

6551
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:47,189
fundamental base of all reality
like you're describing or whether

6552
01:54:47,189 --> 01:54:47,199
like you're describing or whether
 

6553
01:54:47,199 --> 01:54:49,669
like you're describing or whether
there's some

6554
01:54:49,669 --> 01:54:49,679
there's some
 

6555
01:54:49,679 --> 01:54:51,589
there's some
importance to the special pockets of

6556
01:54:51,589 --> 01:54:51,599
importance to the special pockets of
 

6557
01:54:51,599 --> 01:54:53,430
importance to the special pockets of
consciousness that's in humans or living

6558
01:54:53,430 --> 01:54:53,440
consciousness that's in humans or living
 

6559
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:55,990
consciousness that's in humans or living
organisms i'm told i find all those

6560
01:54:55,990 --> 01:54:56,000
organisms i'm told i find all those
 

6561
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,390
organisms i'm told i find all those
ideas beautiful and exciting

6562
01:54:58,390 --> 01:54:58,400
ideas beautiful and exciting
 

6563
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:00,870
ideas beautiful and exciting
and i also

6564
01:55:00,870 --> 01:55:00,880
and i also
 

6565
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:02,870
and i also
know or think

know or think
 

6567
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:06,870
know or think
that robots don't have

6568
01:55:06,870 --> 01:55:06,880
that robots don't have
 

6569
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,870
that robots don't have
consciousness in the same way we've been

6570
01:55:08,870 --> 01:55:08,880
consciousness in the same way we've been
 

6571
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:10,149
consciousness in the same way we've been
describing

6572
01:55:10,149 --> 01:55:10,159
describing
 

6573
01:55:10,159 --> 01:55:11,750

able to form a kind of connection with
robots

6618
01:55:57,189 --> 01:55:57,199
robots
 

6619
01:55:57,199 --> 01:56:00,229
robots
that make me feel like they're conscious

6620
01:56:00,229 --> 01:56:00,239
that make me feel like they're conscious
 

6621
01:56:00,239 --> 01:56:01,910
that make me feel like they're conscious
now i know intellectually they're not

6622
01:56:01,910 --> 01:56:01,920
now i know intellectually they're not
 

6623
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:03,669
now i know intellectually they're not
conscious but i feel like they're

6624
01:56:03,669 --> 01:56:03,679
conscious but i feel like they're
 

6625
01:56:03,679 --> 01:56:05,990
conscious but i feel like they're
conscious and it starts to get into this

6626
01:56:05,990 --> 01:56:06,000
conscious and it starts to get into this
 

6627
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,589
conscious and it starts to get into this
area where

6628
01:56:07,589 --> 01:56:07,599
area where
 

6629
01:56:07,599 --> 01:56:10,790
area where
i'm not so okay so let me use the m word

6630
01:56:10,790 --> 01:56:10,800
i'm not so okay so let me use the m word
 

6631
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:11,830
i'm not so okay so let me use the m word
of murder

6632
01:56:11,830 --> 01:56:11,840
of murder
 

6633
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:15,189
of murder
and i become less and less okay

6634
01:56:15,189 --> 01:56:15,199
and i become less and less okay
 

6635
01:56:15,199 --> 01:56:16,629
and i become less and less okay
murdering

6636
01:56:16,629 --> 01:56:16,639
murdering
 

6637
01:56:16,639 --> 01:56:18,790
murdering
that robot

6638
01:56:18,790 --> 01:56:18,800
that robot
 

6639
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:20,709
that robot
that i know

6640
01:56:20,709 --> 01:56:20,719
that i know
 

6641
01:56:20,719 --> 01:56:25,669
that i know
i quote know is quote not conscious

6642
01:56:25,669 --> 01:56:25,679
i quote know is quote not conscious
 

6643
01:56:25,679 --> 01:56:27,669
i quote know is quote not conscious
so like can you maybe as a therapy

6644
01:56:27,669 --> 01:56:27,679
so like can you maybe as a therapy
 

6645
01:56:27,679 --> 01:56:29,830
so like can you maybe as a therapy
session and help me figure out what we

6646
01:56:29,830 --> 01:56:29,840
session and help me figure out what we
 

6647
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:31,430
session and help me figure out what we
do here

6648
01:56:31,430 --> 01:56:31,440
do here
 

6649
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:34,790
do here
and and perhaps a way to ask that in

6650
01:56:34,790 --> 01:56:34,800
and and perhaps a way to ask that in
 

6651
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:36,950
and and perhaps a way to ask that in
another way do you think there will be a

6652
01:56:36,950 --> 01:56:36,960
another way do you think there will be a
 

6653
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:39,830
another way do you think there will be a
time in like 20 30 50 years

6654
01:56:39,830 --> 01:56:39,840
time in like 20 30 50 years
 

6655
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:42,470
time in like 20 30 50 years
when we're not morally okay

6656
01:56:42,470 --> 01:56:42,480
when we're not morally okay
 

6657
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:46,629
when we're not morally okay
um turning off the power to a robot

6658
01:56:46,629 --> 01:56:46,639
um turning off the power to a robot
 

6659
01:56:46,639 --> 01:56:48,310
um turning off the power to a robot
yeah it's a good question so it's a

6660
01:56:48,310 --> 01:56:48,320
yeah it's a good question so it's a
 

6661
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:50,550
yeah it's a good question so it's a
really good important question i

6662
01:56:50,550 --> 01:56:50,560
really good important question i
 

6663
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:52,950
really good important question i
so i said i'd be okay with

6664
01:56:52,950 --> 01:56:52,960
so i said i'd be okay with
 

6665
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:55,990
so i said i'd be okay with
turning off a philosophical zombie

6666
01:56:55,990 --> 01:56:56,000
turning off a philosophical zombie
 

6667
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:56,870
turning off a philosophical zombie
but

6668
01:56:56,870 --> 01:56:56,880
but
 

6669
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:58,390
but
there's a difficult

6670
01:56:58,390 --> 01:56:58,400
there's a difficult
 

6671
01:56:58,400 --> 01:57:00,709
there's a difficult
epistemological question there that

6672
01:57:00,709 --> 01:57:00,719
epistemological question there that
 

6673
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:02,070
epistemological question there that
meaning you know to do with knowledge

6674
01:57:02,070 --> 01:57:02,080
meaning you know to do with knowledge
 

6675
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:03,750
meaning you know to do with knowledge
how would we know if it was a

6676
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:03,760
how would we know if it was a
 

6677
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:05,750
how would we know if it was a
philosophical zombie i think probably if

6678
01:57:05,750 --> 01:57:05,760
philosophical zombie i think probably if
 

6679
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:06,790
philosophical zombie i think probably if
there were

6680
01:57:06,790 --> 01:57:06,800
there were
 

6681
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:08,149
there were
a silicon

6682
01:57:08,149 --> 01:57:08,159
a silicon
 

6683
01:57:08,159 --> 01:57:11,430
a silicon
creature that could behave just like us

6684
01:57:11,430 --> 01:57:11,440
creature that could behave just like us
 

6685
01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:12,709
creature that could behave just like us
and

6686
01:57:12,709 --> 01:57:12,719
and
 

6687
01:57:12,719 --> 01:57:14,629
and
you know talk about its views about the

6688
01:57:14,629 --> 01:57:14,639
you know talk about its views about the
 

6689
01:57:14,639 --> 01:57:17,109
you know talk about its views about the

01:57:19,350 --> 01:57:19,360
probably we would think it's conscious

um

6694

um
 

6695
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:22,550
um
and it you know it

6696
01:57:22,550 --> 01:57:22,560
and it you know it
 

6697
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:24,310
and it you know it
because consciousness is not publicly

6698
01:57:24,310 --> 01:57:24,320
because consciousness is not publicly
 

6699
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:26,149

01:57:30,149 --> 01:57:30,159
and are not conscious and so in the case
 

6705
01:57:30,159 --> 01:57:31,750

we can't observe their consciousness but

01:57:33,109 --> 01:57:33,119
we can't observe their consciousness but
 

6709
01:57:33,119 --> 01:57:35,430
we can't observe their consciousness but
we can ask them and then we try to you

6710
01:57:35,430 --> 01:57:35,440
we can ask them and then we try to you
 

6711
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:37,669
we can ask them and then we try to you

01:57:40,229 --> 01:57:40,239
we do that and or stimulate
 

6715
01:57:40,239 --> 01:57:42,870
we do that and or stimulate
the brain then we can start to correlate

you inevitably can have both things

you inevitably can have both things
so how do we work out which is which and

6802
01:59:11,910 --> 01:59:11,920
so how do we work out which is which and
 

6803
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:13,830
so how do we work out which is which and
i mean so even in even forgetting the

6804
01:59:13,830 --> 01:59:13,840
i mean so even in even forgetting the
 

6805
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:15,589
i mean so even in even forgetting the
hard problem of consciousness

6806

to find the neural correlates of
consciousness is is really

consciousness is is really
 

6813
01:59:21,679 --> 01:59:24,470
consciousness is is really
hard and there's absolutely no consensus

6814
01:59:24,470 --> 01:59:24,480
hard and there's absolutely no consensus

6817
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:27,510
and
you know so that some people think it's

01:59:27,510 --> 01:59:27,520
you know so that some people think it's

it's just a total mess so

it's just a total mess so

01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:36,310
it's just a total mess so

i guess on any of the reasonably viable

all of them probably would hold that

01:59:47,119 --> 01:59:49,270
all of them probably would hold that
your robots are not conscious but you

your robots are not conscious but you
 

6839
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:51,270
your robots are not conscious but you
know if we could have very sophisticated

um i mean if we go for example for the

um i mean if we go for example for the
 

6845

there could be a

02:00:04,719 --> 02:00:07,270
and has the kind of information a human
brain has but the information is not

6854
02:00:07,270 --> 02:00:07,280
brain has but the information is not
 

6855
02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:09,750
brain has but the information is not
stored in a way that's involves is

6856
02:00:09,750 --> 02:00:09,760
stored in a way that's involves is
 

6857
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:11,109
stored in a way that's involves is
dependent on the integration and

6858
02:00:11,109 --> 02:00:11,119
dependent on the integration and
 

6859
02:00:11,119 --> 02:00:12,870
dependent on the integration and
interconnectedness then according to the

6860
02:00:12,870 --> 02:00:12,880
interconnectedness then according to the
 

6861
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:14,070
interconnectedness then according to the
integrated information theory that thing

6862
02:00:14,070 --> 02:00:14,080
integrated information theory that thing
 

6863
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:15,589
integrated information theory that thing
wouldn't be conscious even though it

6864
02:00:15,589 --> 02:00:15,599
wouldn't be conscious even though it
 

6865
02:00:15,599 --> 02:00:18,709
wouldn't be conscious even though it
behaved just like us if an organism says

behavioral
psychological sociological ways we'll be

6922
02:01:21,750 --> 02:01:21,760
psychological sociological ways we'll be
 

6923
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:23,589
psychological sociological ways we'll be
able to implant themselves into these

6924
02:01:23,589 --> 02:01:23,599
able to implant themselves into these
 

6925
02:01:23,599 --> 02:01:26,629

6933
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:35,629
known each other for all this time like
they can start

6934
02:01:35,629 --> 02:01:35,639
they can start
 

6935
02:01:35,639 --> 02:01:38,149
they can start
manipulating you the same way like

6936
02:01:38,149 --> 02:01:38,159
manipulating you the same way like
 

6937
02:01:38,159 --> 02:01:40,390
manipulating you the same way like
facebook algorithms manipulate you at

6938

facebook algorithms manipulate you at
 

6939
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:42,790
facebook algorithms manipulate you at
first they'll start as a gradual thing

6940
02:01:42,790 --> 02:01:42,800
first they'll start as a gradual thing
 

6941
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:45,109
first they'll start as a gradual thing
that we just you know you want to make a

6942
02:01:45,109 --> 02:01:45,119
that we just you know you want to make a
 

6943
02:01:45,119 --> 02:01:46,629
that we just you know you want to make a
more pleasant experience all those kinds

6944
02:01:46,629 --> 02:01:46,639
more pleasant experience all those kinds
 

6945
02:01:46,639 --> 02:01:48,070
more pleasant experience all those kinds
of things and it'll drift into that

6946
02:01:48,070 --> 02:01:48,080
of things and it'll drift into that
 

6947
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:49,830
of things and it'll drift into that
direction that's something i think about

6948
02:01:49,830 --> 02:01:49,840
direction that's something i think about
 

6949
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:52,149
direction that's something i think about
deeply because i i want to create these

6950
02:01:52,149 --> 02:01:52,159
deeply because i i want to create these
 

6951
02:01:52,159 --> 02:01:53,669
deeply because i i want to create these
kinds of systems but in a way that

6952
02:01:53,669 --> 02:01:53,679
kinds of systems but in a way that
 

6953
02:01:53,679 --> 02:01:55,589
kinds of systems but in a way that
doesn't manipulate people i want it to

6954
02:01:55,589 --> 02:01:55,599
doesn't manipulate people i want it to

people
without manipulation so

that at the same time i'm concerned
 

6967
02:02:06,719 --> 02:02:09,350
that at the same time i'm concerned
about calling the other it's the group

6968
02:02:09,350 --> 02:02:09,360
about calling the other it's the group
 

6969
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:10,550
about calling the other it's the group
thing that we mentioned earlier in the

6970
02:02:10,550 --> 02:02:10,560
thing that we mentioned earlier in the
 

6971
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:14,310
thing that we mentioned earlier in the
conversation some other group

6972

6974
02:02:16,870 --> 02:02:16,880
the philosophical zombie like you're not
 

6975
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:18,390

sort of rebel against their programming
or something i mean that's a little bit

7100
02:04:34,229 --> 02:04:34,239
or something i mean that's a little bit
 

7101
02:04:34,239 --> 02:04:36,790
or something i mean that's a little bit
far-fetched but

02:04:36,790 --> 02:04:36,800
far-fetched but
 

7103

that would be that would be really

that would be that would be really

02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:40,790
that would be that would be really

but that might not turn out to be the

i just got no idea if i just look at the

i just got no idea if i just look at the
 

7131
02:05:04,239 --> 02:05:06,470
i just got no idea if i just look at the

7137
02:05:09,679 --> 02:05:12,550

the moment you stop being a zombie is

the moment you stop being a zombie is
 

7149
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:23,270
the moment you stop being a zombie is
when you say no

when you say no
 

7151
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:25,030
when you say no
is when you resist

is when you resist
 

7153
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:28,709
is when you resist

there's just a difference but maybe

there's just a difference but maybe
 

7241
02:06:57,520 --> 02:06:59,189
there's just a difference but maybe
you're the only non-zombie maybe yeah

7242
02:06:59,189 --> 02:06:59,199
you're the only non-zombie maybe yeah
 

7243
02:06:59,199 --> 02:07:00,629
you're the only non-zombie maybe yeah
maybe that's true i often suspect that

7244
02:07:00,629 --> 02:07:00,639
maybe that's true i often suspect that
 

7245
02:07:00,639 --> 02:07:03,109
maybe that's true i often suspect that
actually i don't really uh i don't have

7246
02:07:03,109 --> 02:07:03,119
actually i don't really uh i don't have
 

7247
02:07:03,119 --> 02:07:05,350
actually i don't really uh i don't have
such delusions of grandeur at least i

7248
02:07:05,350 --> 02:07:05,360
such delusions of grandeur at least i
 

7249
02:07:05,360 --> 02:07:07,270
such delusions of grandeur at least i
don't admit to them um

7250
02:07:07,270 --> 02:07:07,280
don't admit to them um
 

7251
02:07:07,280 --> 02:07:08,470
don't admit to them um
but i just we've got to distinguish the

7252
02:07:08,470 --> 02:07:08,480
but i just we've got to distinguish the
 

7253
02:07:08,480 --> 02:07:09,589
but i just we've got to distinguish the
ontological question from the

7254
02:07:09,589 --> 02:07:09,599
ontological question from the
 

7255
02:07:09,599 --> 02:07:11,430

i you know there must be in my view a

02:07:16,709 --> 02:07:16,719
i you know there must be in my view a
 

7261
02:07:16,719 --> 02:07:17,830
i you know there must be in my view a
fact of the matter as to whether

7262
02:07:17,830 --> 02:07:17,840
fact of the matter as to whether
 

7263
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:19,910
fact of the matter as to whether
something's conscious or not and to me

7264
02:07:19,910 --> 02:07:19,920
something's conscious or not and to me
 

7265
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:21,270
something's conscious or not and to me
it has rights if it's conscious it

7266
02:07:21,270 --> 02:07:21,280
it has rights if it's conscious it
 

7267
02:07:21,280 --> 02:07:22,709
it has rights if it's conscious it
doesn't if it's not

7268
02:07:22,709 --> 02:07:22,719
doesn't if it's not
 

7269
02:07:22,719 --> 02:07:23,910
doesn't if it's not
but then the epistemological question

7270
02:07:23,910 --> 02:07:23,920
but then the epistemological question
 

7271
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:25,510
but then the epistemological question
how the hell do we know

7272
02:07:25,510 --> 02:07:25,520
how the hell do we know
 

7273
02:07:25,520 --> 02:07:26,790
how the hell do we know
um

7274
02:07:26,790 --> 02:07:26,800
um
 

7275
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:29,109
um
it's a minefield but we'll have to sort

7276
02:07:29,109 --> 02:07:29,119
it's a minefield but we'll have to sort
 

7277
02:07:29,119 --> 02:07:30,390
it's a minefield but we'll have to sort
of try and cross that bridge when we get

my view that
 

7313
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:06,069
my view that
we can't explain these things in

7314
02:08:06,069 --> 02:08:06,079
we can't explain these things in
 

7315
02:08:06,079 --> 02:08:08,069
we can't explain these things in
conventional scientific terms or whether

7316
02:08:08,069 --> 02:08:08,079
conventional scientific terms or whether
 

7317
02:08:08,079 --> 02:08:10,149
conventional scientific terms or whether
they have already been explained in

7318
02:08:10,149 --> 02:08:10,159
they have already been explained in
 

7319
02:08:10,159 --> 02:08:13,030
they have already been explained in
conventional scientific terms um

7320
02:08:13,030 --> 02:08:13,040
conventional scientific terms um
 

7321
02:08:13,040 --> 02:08:14,870

i suppose the point i i was trying to

7322
02:08:14,870 --> 02:08:14,880
i suppose the point i i was trying to
 

7323
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:17,189
i suppose the point i i was trying to
press is

7324

we've got to distinguish the question

7326
02:08:18,470 --> 02:08:18,480
we've got to distinguish the question
 

7327
02:08:18,480 --> 02:08:20,229
we've got to distinguish the question
from correlation

from correlation
 

7329
02:08:20,239 --> 02:08:23,589
from correlation
and explanation there's yeah

7330
02:08:23,589 --> 02:08:23,599
and explanation there's yeah
 

7331
02:08:23,599 --> 02:08:25,669
and explanation there's yeah
yes we've established

7332
02:08:25,669 --> 02:08:25,679
yes we've established
 

7333
02:08:25,679 --> 02:08:27,990
yes we've established
facts about correlation that certain

7334

facts about correlation that certain
 

7335
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:29,910
facts about correlation that certain
kinds of brain activity go along with

7336
02:08:29,910 --> 02:08:29,920
kinds of brain activity go along with
 

7337
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:32,149
kinds of brain activity go along with
certain kinds of experience

7338
02:08:32,149 --> 02:08:32,159
certain kinds of experience
 

7339
02:08:32,159 --> 02:08:33,830
certain kinds of experience
everyone agrees on that

7340
02:08:33,830 --> 02:08:33,840
everyone agrees on that
 

7341
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:35,589
everyone agrees on that
and

7342
02:08:35,589 --> 02:08:35,599
and
 

7343
02:08:35,599 --> 02:08:37,750
and
but but that doesn't address

7344
02:08:37,750 --> 02:08:37,760
but but that doesn't address
 

7345
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:40,790
but but that doesn't address
the why question why why do certain

kinds of brain activity go along with
 

7349
02:08:42,480 --> 02:08:44,149
kinds of brain activity go along with
certain kinds of experience and these

02:08:44,149 --> 02:08:44,159
certain kinds of experience and these
 

7351
02:08:44,159 --> 02:08:46,069

02:08:46,069 --> 02:08:46,079
different theories have different
 

7353
02:08:46,079 --> 02:08:49,030
different theories have different
explanations of that you know the

7354
02:08:49,030 --> 02:08:49,040
explanations of that you know the
 

7355
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:51,750
explanations of that you know the
the materialist tries to

7356
02:08:51,750 --> 02:08:51,760
the materialist tries to
 

7357
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:53,910
the materialist tries to
explain the the experience in terms of

7358
02:08:53,910 --> 02:08:53,920
explain the the experience in terms of
 

7359
02:08:53,920 --> 02:08:55,589
explain the the experience in terms of
the brain activity the pancychist does

7360
02:08:55,589 --> 02:08:55,599
the brain activity the pancychist does
 

7361
02:08:55,599 --> 02:08:57,669
the brain activity the pancychist does
it the other way around

7362
02:08:57,669 --> 02:08:57,679
it the other way around
 

7363
02:08:57,679 --> 02:08:59,510
it the other way around
the duelist thinks they're separate but

7364
02:08:59,510 --> 02:08:59,520
the duelist thinks they're separate but
 

7365
02:08:59,520 --> 02:09:01,750
the duelist thinks they're separate but
maybe they're tied together by

7366
02:09:01,750 --> 02:09:01,760
maybe they're tied together by
 

7367
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:03,430
maybe they're tied together by
special laws of nature or something

7368
02:09:03,430 --> 02:09:03,440
special laws of nature or something
 

7369
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:05,350
special laws of nature or something
where's the second point what where

7370
02:09:05,350 --> 02:09:05,360
where's the second point what where
 

7371
02:09:05,360 --> 02:09:07,030
where's the second point what where
exactly was the sticking point like what

7372
02:09:07,030 --> 02:09:07,040
exactly was the sticking point like what
 

7373
02:09:07,040 --> 02:09:09,669
exactly was the sticking point like what
was the nature of the argument i suppose

7374
02:09:09,669 --> 02:09:09,679
was the nature of the argument i suppose
 

7375
02:09:09,679 --> 02:09:12,470
was the nature of the argument i suppose
i suppose joe was saying

7376
02:09:12,470 --> 02:09:12,480
i suppose joe was saying
 

7377
02:09:12,480 --> 02:09:13,589
i suppose joe was saying
well look we

7378
02:09:13,589 --> 02:09:13,599
well look we
 

7379
02:09:13,599 --> 02:09:15,910
well look we
we know consciousness is

7380
02:09:15,910 --> 02:09:15,920
we know consciousness is
 

7381
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:19,270
we know consciousness is
explained by brain activity because

7382
02:09:19,270 --> 02:09:19,280
explained by brain activity because
 

7383
02:09:19,280 --> 02:09:20,709
explained by brain activity because
you know

7384
02:09:20,709 --> 02:09:20,719
you know
 

7385
02:09:20,719 --> 02:09:22,629
you know
you take some funny chemicals it changes

7386
02:09:22,629 --> 02:09:22,639
you take some funny chemicals it changes
 

7387
02:09:22,639 --> 02:09:25,109
you take some funny chemicals it changes
your brain it changes your consciousness

7388
02:09:25,109 --> 02:09:25,119
your brain it changes your consciousness
 

7389
02:09:25,119 --> 02:09:26,870
your brain it changes your consciousness
but um

7390
02:09:26,870 --> 02:09:26,880
but um
 

7391
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:28,229
but um
and i suppose yeah some people might

7392
02:09:28,229 --> 02:09:28,239
and i suppose yeah some people might
 

7393
02:09:28,239 --> 02:09:30,149
and i suppose yeah some people might
want to press and maybe this is what joe

7394
02:09:30,149 --> 02:09:30,159
want to press and maybe this is what joe
 

7395
02:09:30,159 --> 02:09:32,629
want to press and maybe this is what joe
was pressing you know isn't isn't that

7396
02:09:32,629 --> 02:09:32,639
was pressing you know isn't isn't that
 

7397
02:09:32,639 --> 02:09:34,069
was pressing you know isn't isn't that
explaining consciousness but i suppose i

7398
02:09:34,069 --> 02:09:34,079
explaining consciousness but i suppose i
 

7399
02:09:34,079 --> 02:09:35,990
explaining consciousness but i suppose i
want to say

7400
02:09:35,990 --> 02:09:36,000
want to say
 

7401
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,870
want to say
there's a further question yes

7402
02:09:38,870 --> 02:09:38,880
there's a further question yes
 

7403
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:41,189
there's a further question yes
changes of chemicals in my brain changes

7404
02:09:41,189 --> 02:09:41,199
changes of chemicals in my brain changes
 

7405
02:09:41,199 --> 02:09:43,669
changes of chemicals in my brain changes
my conscious experience

7406
02:09:43,669 --> 02:09:43,679
my conscious experience
 

7407
02:09:43,679 --> 02:09:45,830
my conscious experience
but that leaves open the question why

7408
02:09:45,830 --> 02:09:45,840
but that leaves open the question why
 

7409
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:47,910
but that leaves open the question why
those particular chemicals go along with

7410
02:09:47,910 --> 02:09:47,920
those particular chemicals go along with
 

7411
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:49,910
those particular chemicals go along with
that particular kind of experience

7412
02:09:49,910 --> 02:09:49,920
that particular kind of experience
 

7413
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:51,030
that particular kind of experience
rather than

7414
02:09:51,030 --> 02:09:51,040
rather than
 

7415
02:09:51,040 --> 02:09:52,550
rather than
a different experience or no experience

7416
02:09:52,550 --> 02:09:52,560
a different experience or no experience
 

7417
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:54,550
a different experience or no experience
at all there's something

7418
02:09:54,550 --> 02:09:54,560
at all there's something
 

7419
02:09:54,560 --> 02:09:56,709
at all there's something
deeper at the base layer

7420
02:09:56,709 --> 02:09:56,719
deeper at the base layer
 

7421
02:09:56,719 --> 02:09:58,310
deeper at the base layer
is your view

7422
02:09:58,310 --> 02:09:58,320
is your view
 

7423
02:09:58,320 --> 02:09:59,189
is your view
that

7424
02:09:59,189 --> 02:09:59,199
that
 

7425
02:09:59,199 --> 02:10:00,629
that
is is

7426
02:10:00,629 --> 02:10:00,639
is is
 

7427
02:10:00,639 --> 02:10:02,149
is is
more important to try to study and to

7428
02:10:02,149 --> 02:10:02,159
more important to try to study and to
 

7429
02:10:02,159 --> 02:10:04,229
more important to try to study and to
understand in order to then go back and

7430
02:10:04,229 --> 02:10:04,239
understand in order to then go back and
 

7431
02:10:04,239 --> 02:10:06,229
understand in order to then go back and
describe how the different chemicals

7432
02:10:06,229 --> 02:10:06,239
describe how the different chemicals
 

7433
02:10:06,239 --> 02:10:07,350
describe how the different chemicals
interact and create different

7434
02:10:07,350 --> 02:10:07,360
interact and create different
 

7435
02:10:07,360 --> 02:10:09,350
interact and create different
experiences

7436
02:10:09,350 --> 02:10:09,360
experiences
 

7437
02:10:09,360 --> 02:10:11,189
experiences
yeah maybe a good analogy if you think

7438
02:10:11,189 --> 02:10:11,199
yeah maybe a good analogy if you think
 

7439
02:10:11,199 --> 02:10:14,069
yeah maybe a good analogy if you think
about quantum mechanics um

7440
02:10:14,069 --> 02:10:14,079
about quantum mechanics um
 

7441
02:10:14,079 --> 02:10:15,669
about quantum mechanics um
you know quantum mechanics is a is a bit

7442
02:10:15,669 --> 02:10:15,679
you know quantum mechanics is a is a bit

7465
02:10:38,159 --> 02:10:39,270
know um the brits are confused yeah
sorry about that we have these funny

7466
02:10:39,270 --> 02:10:39,280
sorry about that we have these funny
 

7467
02:10:39,280 --> 02:10:42,709
sorry about that we have these funny
spellings but anyway um

7468

yeah so quantum mechanics is a bit of

7470
02:10:44,310 --> 02:10:44,320
yeah so quantum mechanics is a bit of
 

7471
02:10:44,320 --> 02:10:45,430
yeah so quantum mechanics is a bit of
maths

7472

maths
 

7473
02:10:45,440 --> 02:10:47,189
maths
and um

7474
02:10:47,189 --> 02:10:47,199
and um
 

7475
02:10:47,199 --> 02:10:49,030
and um
you know the equations work really well

7476
02:10:49,030 --> 02:10:49,040
you know the equations work really well
 

7477
02:10:49,040 --> 02:10:51,510
you know the equations work really well
predicts the outcomes but then there's a

7478
02:10:51,510 --> 02:10:51,520
predicts the outcomes but then there's a
 

7479
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:53,669
predicts the outcomes but then there's a
further question

7480
02:10:53,669 --> 02:10:53,679
further question
 

7481
02:10:53,679 --> 02:10:56,709
further question
what's going on in reality to make make

7482
02:10:56,709 --> 02:10:56,719
what's going on in reality to make make
 

7483
02:10:56,719 --> 02:10:59,910
what's going on in reality to make make
that equation predict correctly and some

7484
02:10:59,910 --> 02:10:59,920
that equation predict correctly and some
 

7485
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:02,390

physicists want to say shut up

7486
02:11:02,390 --> 02:11:02,400
physicists want to say shut up
 

7487
02:11:02,400 --> 02:11:05,189
physicists want to say shut up
just it works uh the shut up and

7488
02:11:05,189 --> 02:11:05,199
just it works uh the shut up and
 

7489
02:11:05,199 --> 02:11:06,629
just it works uh the shut up and

in consciousness you know i think

7494
02:11:10,790 --> 02:11:10,800
in consciousness you know i think
 

7495
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:12,790
in consciousness you know i think
it's one question

7496
02:11:12,790 --> 02:11:12,800
it's one question
 

7497
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:13,990
it's one question
trying to work out the physical

7498
02:11:13,990 --> 02:11:14,000
trying to work out the physical

02:11:15,510 --> 02:11:15,520
correlates of consciousness which kinds
 

7501
02:11:15,520 --> 02:11:16,950
correlates of consciousness which kinds
of physical brain activity go along

7502
02:11:16,950 --> 02:11:16,960
of physical brain activity go along
 

7503
02:11:16,960 --> 02:11:18,709
of physical brain activity go along
which kind of experience but there's

7504
02:11:18,709 --> 02:11:18,719
which kind of experience but there's
 

7505
02:11:18,719 --> 02:11:20,550
which kind of experience but there's
another question what's going on in

7506
02:11:20,550 --> 02:11:20,560
another question what's going on in
 

7507
02:11:20,560 --> 02:11:22,390
another question what's going on in
reality

7508
02:11:22,390 --> 02:11:22,400
reality

to undergird those correlations to make

7510
02:11:24,470 --> 02:11:24,480
to undergird those correlations to make
 

7511
02:11:24,480 --> 02:11:26,069
to undergird those correlations to make
it the case that brain activity goes

7512
02:11:26,069 --> 02:11:26,079
it the case that brain activity goes
 

7513
02:11:26,079 --> 02:11:27,109
it the case that brain activity goes
along with experience and that's the

7514
02:11:27,109 --> 02:11:27,119
along with experience and that's the
 

7515
02:11:27,119 --> 02:11:29,270
along with experience and that's the
philosophical question

7516
02:11:29,270 --> 02:11:29,280
philosophical question
 

7517
02:11:29,280 --> 02:11:30,870
philosophical question
that that we have to give an answer to

7518
02:11:30,870 --> 02:11:30,880
that that we have to give an answer to
 

7519
02:11:30,880 --> 02:11:32,470
that that we have to give an answer to
and they're just they're just different

7520
02:11:32,470 --> 02:11:32,480
and they're just they're just different
 

7521
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:34,069
and they're just they're just different
options just as there are different

7522
02:11:34,069 --> 02:11:34,079
options just as there are different
 

7523
02:11:34,079 --> 02:11:35,510
options just as there are different
interpretations of quantum mechanics and

7524
02:11:35,510 --> 02:11:35,520
interpretations of quantum mechanics and
 

7525
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:36,950
interpretations of quantum mechanics and
it's

7526
02:11:36,950 --> 02:11:36,960
it's
 

7527
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:39,270
it's
it's really hard to evaluate actually

7528
02:11:39,270 --> 02:11:39,280
it's really hard to evaluate actually
 

7529
02:11:39,280 --> 02:11:40,790
it's really hard to evaluate actually
it's easy pan psychism is obviously the

7530
02:11:40,790 --> 02:11:40,800
it's easy pan psychism is obviously the
 

7531
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:42,310
it's easy pan psychism is obviously the
best one

7532
02:11:42,310 --> 02:11:42,320
best one
 

7533
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:43,430
best one
but um

7534
02:11:43,430 --> 02:11:43,440
but um
 

7535
02:11:43,440 --> 02:11:45,189
but um
there's a conclusion of grandeur once

7536
02:11:45,189 --> 02:11:45,199
there's a conclusion of grandeur once
 

7537
02:11:45,199 --> 02:11:47,669
there's a conclusion of grandeur once

university
 

7565
02:12:17,040 --> 02:12:18,870
university
um so this is interesting to me for

7566
02:12:18,870 --> 02:12:18,880
um so this is interesting to me for
 

7567
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:20,390
um so this is interesting to me for
several reasons

7568
02:12:20,390 --> 02:12:20,400
several reasons
 

7569
02:12:20,400 --> 02:12:21,350
several reasons
that are

7570
02:12:21,350 --> 02:12:21,360
that are
 

7571
02:12:21,360 --> 02:12:23,510
that are
perhaps complicated to explain

7572
02:12:23,510 --> 02:12:23,520
perhaps complicated to explain
 

7573
02:12:23,520 --> 02:12:25,750
perhaps complicated to explain
to put simply that there is

7574
02:12:25,750 --> 02:12:25,760
to put simply that there is
 

7575
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:28,229
to put simply that there is
in the near term for me a trip to russia

7576
02:12:28,229 --> 02:12:28,239
in the near term for me a trip to russia
 

7577
02:12:28,239 --> 02:12:31,109
in the near term for me a trip to russia
that involves a few conversations in

7578
02:12:31,109 --> 02:12:31,119
that involves a few conversations in
 

7579
02:12:31,119 --> 02:12:33,270
that involves a few conversations in
russian

7580
02:12:33,270 --> 02:12:33,280
russian
 

7581
02:12:33,280 --> 02:12:35,990
russian
that have perhaps

7582
02:12:35,990 --> 02:12:36,000
that have perhaps
 

7583
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:37,589
that have perhaps
less to do with consciousness and

7584
02:12:37,589 --> 02:12:37,599
less to do with consciousness and
 

7585
02:12:37,599 --> 02:12:39,109
less to do with consciousness and
artificial intelligence which are the

7586
02:12:39,109 --> 02:12:39,119
artificial intelligence which are the
 

7587
02:12:39,119 --> 02:12:40,950
artificial intelligence which are the
interests of mine and more to do with

7588
02:12:40,950 --> 02:12:40,960
interests of mine and more to do with
 

7589
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:43,589
interests of mine and more to do with
the broad spectrum of conversations but

7590
02:12:43,589 --> 02:12:43,599
the broad spectrum of conversations but
 

7591
02:12:43,599 --> 02:12:47,189
the broad spectrum of conversations but
i'm also interested in science

7592
02:12:47,189 --> 02:12:47,199
i'm also interested in science
 

7593
02:12:47,199 --> 02:12:49,669
i'm also interested in science
in russia in artificial intelligence and

7594
02:12:49,669 --> 02:12:49,679
in russia in artificial intelligence and
 

7595
02:12:49,679 --> 02:12:51,030
in russia in artificial intelligence and
computer science

7596
02:12:51,030 --> 02:12:51,040
computer science
 

7597
02:12:51,040 --> 02:12:53,750
computer science
in physics mathematics but also these

7598
02:12:53,750 --> 02:12:53,760
in physics mathematics but also these
 

7599
02:12:53,760 --> 02:12:56,470
in physics mathematics but also these
fascinating philosophical explorations

7600
02:12:56,470 --> 02:12:56,480
fascinating philosophical explorations
 

7601
02:12:56,480 --> 02:12:58,709
fascinating philosophical explorations
and it was a very pleasant for me to

7602
02:12:58,709 --> 02:12:58,719
and it was a very pleasant for me to
 

7603
02:12:58,719 --> 02:13:00,629
and it was a very pleasant for me to
discover that such a

7604
02:13:00,629 --> 02:13:00,639
discover that such a
 

7605
02:13:00,639 --> 02:13:02,550
discover that such a
center exists

7606
02:13:02,550 --> 02:13:02,560
center exists
 

7607
02:13:02,560 --> 02:13:03,350
center exists
so

7608
02:13:03,350 --> 02:13:03,360
so
 

7609
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:05,109
so
i have a million questions one is with

7610
02:13:05,109 --> 02:13:05,119
i have a million questions one is with
 

7611
02:13:05,119 --> 02:13:06,870
i have a million questions one is with
the more fun question just to imagine

7612
02:13:06,870 --> 02:13:06,880
the more fun question just to imagine
 

7613
02:13:06,880 --> 02:13:08,790
the more fun question just to imagine
you and daniel diana and ya talking

7614
02:13:08,790 --> 02:13:08,800
you and daniel diana and ya talking
 

7615
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:09,830
you and daniel diana and ya talking
about the

7616
02:13:09,830 --> 02:13:09,840
about the
 

7617
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:12,310
about the
philosophy of consciousness maybe do you

7618
02:13:12,310 --> 02:13:12,320
philosophy of consciousness maybe do you
 

7619
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:14,790
philosophy of consciousness maybe do you
have any memorable experiences

7620
02:13:14,790 --> 02:13:14,800
have any memorable experiences
 

7621
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:17,990
have any memorable experiences
and also the more serious side for me as

7622
02:13:17,990 --> 02:13:18,000
and also the more serious side for me as
 

7623
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:19,910
and also the more serious side for me as
sort of somebody was born in the soviet

7624
02:13:19,910 --> 02:13:19,920
sort of somebody was born in the soviet
 

7625
02:13:19,920 --> 02:13:21,430
sort of somebody was born in the soviet
union raised there

7626
02:13:21,430 --> 02:13:21,440
union raised there
 

7627
02:13:21,440 --> 02:13:22,470
union raised there
uh i'm

7628
02:13:22,470 --> 02:13:22,480
uh i'm
 

7629
02:13:22,480 --> 02:13:25,589
uh i'm
wondering what is the state

7630
02:13:25,589 --> 02:13:25,599
wondering what is the state
 

7631
02:13:25,599 --> 02:13:27,910
wondering what is the state
of philosophy and consciousness and

7632
02:13:27,910 --> 02:13:27,920
of philosophy and consciousness and
 

7633
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:29,669
of philosophy and consciousness and
these kinds of ideas in russia that

7634
02:13:29,669 --> 02:13:29,679
these kinds of ideas in russia that
 

7635
02:13:29,679 --> 02:13:31,750
these kinds of ideas in russia that
you've gotten a chance to kind of give

7636
02:13:31,750 --> 02:13:31,760
you've gotten a chance to kind of give
 

7637
02:13:31,760 --> 02:13:34,790
you've gotten a chance to kind of give
us uh interact with

7638
02:13:34,790 --> 02:13:34,800
us uh interact with
 

7639
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:36,790
us uh interact with
yeah so on the former question

7640
02:13:36,790 --> 02:13:36,800
yeah so on the former question
 

7641
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:38,470
yeah so on the former question

he was wrong about something just just a

7662
02:13:57,510 --> 02:13:57,520
he was wrong about something just just a
 

7663
02:13:57,520 --> 02:13:59,189
he was wrong about something just just a
tiny thing you know not his fundamental

7664
02:13:59,189 --> 02:13:59,199
tiny thing you know not his fundamental
 

7665
02:13:59,199 --> 02:14:00,629
tiny thing you know not his fundamental
world view

7666
02:14:00,629 --> 02:14:00,639
world view
 

7667
02:14:00,639 --> 02:14:01,910
world view
uh

7668
02:14:01,910 --> 02:14:01,920
uh
 

7669
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:04,709
uh
but it was this issue about

7670
02:14:04,709 --> 02:14:04,719
but it was this issue about
 

7671
02:14:04,719 --> 02:14:06,709
but it was this issue about
um

7672
02:14:06,709 --> 02:14:06,719
um
 

7673
02:14:06,719 --> 02:14:09,270
um
whether dualism is consistent with

7674
02:14:09,270 --> 02:14:09,280
whether dualism is consistent with
 

7675
02:14:09,280 --> 02:14:11,750
whether dualism is consistent with
conservation of energy

7676
02:14:11,750 --> 02:14:11,760
conservation of energy
 

7677
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:12,470
conservation of energy
so

7678
02:14:12,470 --> 02:14:12,480
so
 

7679
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:15,109
so
paul churchland who was also uh his

7680
02:14:15,109 --> 02:14:15,119
paul churchland who was also uh his
 

7681
02:14:15,119 --> 02:14:17,430
paul churchland who was also uh his
philosopher who's also

7682
02:14:17,430 --> 02:14:17,440
philosopher who's also
 

7683
02:14:17,440 --> 02:14:19,030
philosopher who's also
on this boat

7684
02:14:19,030 --> 02:14:19,040
on this boat
 

7685
02:14:19,040 --> 02:14:20,870
on this boat
had argued they're not consistent

7686
02:14:20,870 --> 02:14:20,880
had argued they're not consistent
 

7687
02:14:20,880 --> 02:14:23,510
had argued they're not consistent
because if there's an immaterial soul

7688
02:14:23,510 --> 02:14:23,520
because if there's an immaterial soul
 

7689
02:14:23,520 --> 02:14:25,430
because if there's an immaterial soul
doing things in the brain that's to add

7690
02:14:25,430 --> 02:14:25,440
doing things in the brain that's to add
 

7691
02:14:25,440 --> 02:14:27,750
doing things in the brain that's to add
to the energy in the system so we have a

7692
02:14:27,750 --> 02:14:27,760
to the energy in the system so we have a
 

7693
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:30,229
to the energy in the system so we have a
violation of conservation but

7694
02:14:30,229 --> 02:14:30,239
violation of conservation but
 

7695
02:14:30,239 --> 02:14:31,910
violation of conservation but
well it's not my own point philosophers

7696
02:14:31,910 --> 02:14:31,920
well it's not my own point philosophers
 

7697
02:14:31,920 --> 02:14:33,750
well it's not my own point philosophers
materialist philosophers like dave like

7698
02:14:33,750 --> 02:14:33,760
materialist philosophers like dave like
 

7699
02:14:33,760 --> 02:14:35,910
materialist philosophers like dave like
david papano have pointed out that you

7700
02:14:35,910 --> 02:14:35,920
david papano have pointed out that you
 

7701
02:14:35,920 --> 02:14:37,109
david papano have pointed out that you
know

7702
02:14:37,109 --> 02:14:37,119
know
 

7703
02:14:37,119 --> 02:14:39,270
know
duelists tend to

7704
02:14:39,270 --> 02:14:39,280
duelists tend to
 

7705
02:14:39,280 --> 02:14:41,189
duelists tend to
people duelists like david chalmers who

7706

people duelists like david chalmers who
 

7707
02:14:41,199 --> 02:14:42,950
people duelists like david chalmers who
call themselves naturalistic jewelers

7708

they want to bring consciousness into

7710
02:14:44,709 --> 02:14:44,719
they want to bring consciousness into
 

7711
02:14:44,719 --> 02:14:47,589
they want to bring consciousness into
science they think it's not physical

science they think it's not physical
 

7713
02:14:47,599 --> 02:14:49,589
science they think it's not physical
but they want to say it's it's it can be

02:14:49,589 --> 02:14:49,599
but they want to say it's it's it can be
 

7715
02:14:49,599 --> 02:14:52,550
but they want to say it's it's it can be
part of a law-governed world so chalmers

7716
02:14:52,550 --> 02:14:52,560
part of a law-governed world so chalmers
 

7717
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:55,350
part of a law-governed world so chalmers
believes in these psychophysical laws of

02:14:55,350 --> 02:14:55,360
believes in these psychophysical laws of
 

7719
02:14:55,360 --> 02:14:57,350
believes in these psychophysical laws of

physics that govern
 

7723
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:01,430
physics that govern
the connections between consciousness

7724
02:15:01,430 --> 02:15:01,440
the connections between consciousness
 

7725
02:15:01,440 --> 02:15:03,510
the connections between consciousness
and the physical world and they could

7726
02:15:03,510 --> 02:15:03,520
and the physical world and they could
 

7727
02:15:03,520 --> 02:15:05,109
and the physical world and they could
just respect conservation of energy

7728
02:15:05,109 --> 02:15:05,119
just respect conservation of energy
 

7729
02:15:05,119 --> 02:15:07,350
just respect conservation of energy
right i mean it could turn out

7730
02:15:07,350 --> 02:15:07,360
right i mean it could turn out
 

7731
02:15:07,360 --> 02:15:08,629
right i mean it could turn out
that there are

7732
02:15:08,629 --> 02:15:08,639
that there are
 

7733
02:15:08,639 --> 02:15:09,990
that there are
just in physics you know that there are

7734
02:15:09,990 --> 02:15:10,000
just in physics you know that there are
 

7735
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:11,430
just in physics you know that there are
multiple

7736

forces that all work together to respect

forces that all work together to respect
 

7739
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:15,030
forces that all work together to respect
conservation of energy i mean i suppose

7740
02:15:15,030 --> 02:15:15,040
conservation of energy i mean i suppose
 

7741
02:15:15,040 --> 02:15:16,790
conservation of energy i mean i suppose
physicists are pressing for

7742
02:15:16,790 --> 02:15:16,800
physicists are pressing for
 

7743
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:18,950
physicists are pressing for
a unified underlying theory but you know

7744
02:15:18,950 --> 02:15:18,960
a unified underlying theory but you know
 

7745
02:15:18,960 --> 02:15:21,189
a unified underlying theory but you know
there could be a plurality of different

7746
02:15:21,189 --> 02:15:21,199
there could be a plurality of different
 

7747
02:15:21,199 --> 02:15:22,950
there could be a plurality of different
laws that all respect conservation so

7748
02:15:22,950 --> 02:15:22,960
laws that all respect conservation so
 

7749
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:24,229
laws that all respect conservation so
why not add

7750
02:15:24,229 --> 02:15:24,239
why not add
 

7751
02:15:24,239 --> 02:15:25,990
why not add
more laws um

7752
02:15:25,990 --> 02:15:26,000
more laws um
 

7753
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:27,510
more laws um
so i raised this in paul churchill's

7754
02:15:27,510 --> 02:15:27,520
so i raised this in paul churchill's
 

7755
02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:29,910
so i raised this in paul churchill's
talk and uh

7756
02:15:29,910 --> 02:15:29,920
talk and uh
 

7757
02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:31,030
talk and uh
i got

7758
02:15:31,030 --> 02:15:31,040
i got
 

7759
02:15:31,040 --> 02:15:33,430
i got
a lot of well as one of the moscow

7760

university graduate students that
 

7763
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:36,870
university graduate students that
afterwards he said he had to ask a

7764
02:15:36,870 --> 02:15:36,880
afterwards he said he had to ask a
 

7765
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:38,310
afterwards he said he had to ask a
translation from his friend and he said

7766
02:15:38,310 --> 02:15:38,320
translation from his friend and he said
 

7767
02:15:38,320 --> 02:15:39,910
translation from his friend and he said
everybody say they turned on you like a

7768
02:15:39,910 --> 02:15:39,920
everybody say they turned on you like a
 

7769
02:15:39,920 --> 02:15:42,470
everybody say they turned on you like a
pack of wolves everyone was like and

7770
02:15:42,470 --> 02:15:42,480
pack of wolves everyone was like and
 

7771
02:15:42,480 --> 02:15:43,669
pack of wolves everyone was like and
patricia churchill was saying so you

7772
02:15:43,669 --> 02:15:43,679
patricia churchill was saying so you
 

7773
02:15:43,679 --> 02:15:45,189
patricia churchill was saying so you
believe in magic do you and i was like

7774
02:15:45,189 --> 02:15:45,199
believe in magic do you and i was like
 

7775
02:15:45,199 --> 02:15:47,669
believe in magic do you and i was like
i'm not even a duelist i'm just making a

7776
02:15:47,669 --> 02:15:47,679
i'm not even a duelist i'm just making a
 

7777
02:15:47,679 --> 02:15:50,229
i'm not even a duelist i'm just making a
pedantic point that this isn't a problem

7778
02:15:50,229 --> 02:15:50,239
pedantic point that this isn't a problem
 

7779
02:15:50,239 --> 02:15:52,069
pedantic point that this isn't a problem
for dualism anyway but that evening

7780
02:15:52,069 --> 02:15:52,079
for dualism anyway but that evening
 

7781
02:15:52,079 --> 02:15:53,510
for dualism anyway but that evening
everyone went

7782
02:15:53,510 --> 02:15:53,520
everyone went
 

7783
02:15:53,520 --> 02:15:55,030
everyone went
onto the island except for some reason

7784
02:15:55,030 --> 02:15:55,040
onto the island except for some reason

me and daniel dennett and
 

7787
02:15:57,040 --> 02:15:59,189
me and daniel dennett and
i went up on deck and he was he's very

7788
02:15:59,189 --> 02:15:59,199
i went up on deck and he was he's very
 

7789
02:15:59,199 --> 02:16:01,750
i went up on deck and he was he's very
very practical and he was unlike me

7790
02:16:01,750 --> 02:16:01,760
very practical and he was unlike me
 

7791
02:16:01,760 --> 02:16:03,589
very practical and he was unlike me
see there's a bit of humility for first

7792
02:16:03,589 --> 02:16:03,599
see there's a bit of humility for first
 

7793
02:16:03,599 --> 02:16:05,189
see there's a bit of humility for first
time in this conversation

7794
02:16:05,189 --> 02:16:05,199
time in this conversation
 

7795
02:16:05,199 --> 02:16:07,990
time in this conversation
we'll highlight that part

7796
02:16:07,990 --> 02:16:08,000
we'll highlight that part
 

7797
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:09,990
we'll highlight that part
philip was a very humble man

7798
02:16:09,990 --> 02:16:10,000
philip was a very humble man
 

7799
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,470
philip was a very humble man
he was carving a walking stick on deck

7800
02:16:12,470 --> 02:16:12,480
he was carving a walking stick on deck
 

7801
02:16:12,480 --> 02:16:14,390
he was carving a walking stick on deck
it's very homely scene and anyway we

7802
02:16:14,390 --> 02:16:14,400
it's very homely scene and anyway we
 

7803
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:15,350
it's very homely scene and anyway we
started talking about this and i was

7804
02:16:15,350 --> 02:16:15,360
started talking about this and i was
 

7805
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:17,189
started talking about this and i was
trying to press it and he was saying

7806
02:16:17,189 --> 02:16:17,199
trying to press it and he was saying
 

7807
02:16:17,199 --> 02:16:18,950
trying to press it and he was saying
about dualism is a lot of nonsense and

7808
02:16:18,950 --> 02:16:18,960
about dualism is a lot of nonsense and
 

7809
02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:20,390
about dualism is a lot of nonsense and
why do you think and i was just saying

7810
02:16:20,390 --> 02:16:20,400
why do you think and i was just saying
 

7811
02:16:20,400 --> 02:16:22,390
why do you think and i was just saying
no no i'm just this honing down on this

7812
02:16:22,390 --> 02:16:22,400
no no i'm just this honing down on this
 

7813
02:16:22,400 --> 02:16:24,470
no no i'm just this honing down on this
specific point and in the end maybe

7814
02:16:24,470 --> 02:16:24,480
specific point and in the end maybe
 

7815
02:16:24,480 --> 02:16:26,149
specific point and in the end maybe
he'll deny this but he said

7816
02:16:26,149 --> 02:16:26,159
he'll deny this but he said
 

7817
02:16:26,159 --> 02:16:28,790
he'll deny this but he said
maybe that's right and um that's like

7818
02:16:28,790 --> 02:16:28,800
maybe that's right and um that's like
 

7819
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:30,310
maybe that's right and um that's like
this

7820
02:16:30,310 --> 02:16:30,320
this
 

7821
02:16:30,320 --> 02:16:31,109
this
so

7822
02:16:31,109 --> 02:16:31,119
so
 

7823
02:16:31,119 --> 02:16:33,830
so

the connection between free will and
 

7989
02:19:21,200 --> 02:19:24,309
the connection between free will and
consciousness to you so if

7990
02:19:24,309 --> 02:19:24,319
consciousness to you so if
 

7991
02:19:24,319 --> 02:19:27,830
consciousness to you so if
consciousness permeates all matter

7992
02:19:27,830 --> 02:19:27,840

the feeling like
 

7999
02:19:33,359 --> 02:19:36,070
the feeling like
we make a choice in this world like our

8000
02:19:36,070 --> 02:19:36,080
we make a choice in this world like our
 

8001
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:38,950
we make a choice in this world like our
actions are results of a choice we

8002
02:19:38,950 --> 02:19:38,960
actions are results of a choice we
 

8003
02:19:38,960 --> 02:19:41,110
actions are results of a choice we
consciously make to lose that to use

8004
02:19:41,110 --> 02:19:41,120
consciously make to lose that to use
 

8005

that word loosely

8006
02:19:44,070 --> 02:19:44,080
that word loosely

that word loosely
what do you

8008
02:19:46,549 --> 02:19:46,559
what do you
 

8009
02:19:46,559 --> 02:19:48,230
what do you
is the connection between free will and

8010
02:19:48,230 --> 02:19:48,240
is the connection between free will and
 

8011
02:19:48,240 --> 02:19:50,230
is the connection between free will and
consciousness and is free will and

8012
02:19:50,230 --> 02:19:50,240
consciousness and is free will and
 

8013
02:19:50,240 --> 02:19:52,950
consciousness and is free will and
illusion or not

8014
02:19:52,950 --> 02:19:52,960
illusion or not
 

8015
02:19:52,960 --> 02:19:55,270
illusion or not
good question so

8016
02:19:55,270 --> 02:19:55,280
good question so
 

8017
02:19:55,280 --> 02:19:57,270
good question so
i think we need to be

8018
02:19:57,270 --> 02:19:57,280
i think we need to be
 

8019
02:19:57,280 --> 02:19:59,190
i think we need to be
a lot more agnostic

8020
02:19:59,190 --> 02:19:59,200
a lot more agnostic
 

8021
02:19:59,200 --> 02:20:00,870
a lot more agnostic
about free will than than about

8022
02:20:00,870 --> 02:20:00,880
about free will than than about
 

8023
02:20:00,880 --> 02:20:03,830
about free will than than about
consciousness because

8024
02:20:03,830 --> 02:20:03,840
consciousness because
 

8025
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:05,110
consciousness because
i don't think we have the kind of

8026
02:20:05,110 --> 02:20:05,120
i don't think we have the kind of
 

8027
02:20:05,120 --> 02:20:06,630
i don't think we have the kind of
certainty

8028
02:20:06,630 --> 02:20:06,640
certainty
 

8029
02:20:06,640 --> 02:20:08,070
certainty
of the existence of free will that we do

8030
02:20:08,070 --> 02:20:08,080
of the existence of free will that we do
 

8031
02:20:08,080 --> 02:20:09,510
of the existence of free will that we do
have in the consciousness case it could

8032
02:20:09,510 --> 02:20:09,520
have in the consciousness case it could
 

8033
02:20:09,520 --> 02:20:11,190
have in the consciousness case it could
turn out that free will is an illusion

8034
02:20:11,190 --> 02:20:11,200
turn out that free will is an illusion
 

8035
02:20:11,200 --> 02:20:13,030
turn out that free will is an illusion
it could be it feels as though we're

8036
02:20:13,030 --> 02:20:13,040
it could be it feels as though we're
 

8037
02:20:13,040 --> 02:20:14,790
it could be it feels as though we're
free when we're really not

8038
02:20:14,790 --> 02:20:14,800
free when we're really not
 

8039
02:20:14,800 --> 02:20:17,349
free when we're really not
whereas i mean i think the idea

8040
02:20:17,349 --> 02:20:17,359
whereas i mean i think the idea
 

8041
02:20:17,359 --> 02:20:19,349
whereas i mean i think the idea
that nobody really really feels pain

8042
02:20:19,349 --> 02:20:19,359
that nobody really really feels pain
 

8043
02:20:19,359 --> 02:20:21,190
that nobody really really feels pain
that we think we feel pain but that's a

8044
02:20:21,190 --> 02:20:21,200
that we think we feel pain but that's a
 

8045
02:20:21,200 --> 02:20:23,110
that we think we feel pain but that's a
lot harder to make sense of

8046
02:20:23,110 --> 02:20:23,120
lot harder to make sense of
 

8047
02:20:23,120 --> 02:20:24,630
lot harder to make sense of
however

02:20:37,110 --> 02:20:37,120
will and i mean
 

8059
02:20:37,120 --> 02:20:38,950
will and i mean
strong free will and what philosophers

8060
02:20:38,950 --> 02:20:38,960
strong free will and what philosophers
 

8061
02:20:38,960 --> 02:20:40,710
strong free will and what philosophers
call libertarian free will in the sense

you can't

8146
02:22:03,429 --> 02:22:03,439
you can't
 

8147
02:22:03,439 --> 02:22:05,670
you can't
really

8148
02:22:05,670 --> 02:22:05,680
really
 

8149
02:22:05,680 --> 02:22:07,750
really
be having the same conversation but at

8150
02:22:07,750 --> 02:22:07,760
be having the same conversation but at
 

8151
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:09,349
be having the same conversation but at
the same time

8152
02:22:09,349 --> 02:22:09,359
the same time
 

8153
02:22:09,359 --> 02:22:10,950
the same time
it's it could be argued that it's

8154
02:22:10,950 --> 02:22:10,960
it's it could be argued that it's
 

8155
02:22:10,960 --> 02:22:12,230
it's it could be argued that it's
impossible to get

8156
02:22:12,230 --> 02:22:12,240
impossible to get
 

8157
02:22:12,240 --> 02:22:14,870
impossible to get
terms perfectly precise and perfectly

8158
02:22:14,870 --> 02:22:14,880
terms perfectly precise and perfectly
 

8159
02:22:14,880 --> 02:22:16,630
terms perfectly precise and perfectly
formalized so

8160
02:22:16,630 --> 02:22:16,640
formalized so
 

8161
02:22:16,640 --> 02:22:18,309
formalized so
then you're also not not going to get

8162
02:22:18,309 --> 02:22:18,319
then you're also not not going to get
 

8163
02:22:18,319 --> 02:22:20,309
then you're also not not going to get
anywhere in the conversation so

8164
02:22:20,309 --> 02:22:20,319
anywhere in the conversation so
 

8165
02:22:20,319 --> 02:22:22,710
anywhere in the conversation so
um that's a it's a funny dance where you

8166
02:22:22,710 --> 02:22:22,720
um that's a it's a funny dance where you
 

8167
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:24,309
um that's a it's a funny dance where you
have to be both rigorous and everyone's

8168
02:22:24,309 --> 02:22:24,319
have to be both rigorous and everyone's
 

8169
02:22:24,319 --> 02:22:26,870
have to be both rigorous and everyone's
neurologist let go and then go and go

8170
02:22:26,870 --> 02:22:26,880
neurologist let go and then go and go
 

8171
02:22:26,880 --> 02:22:29,110
neurologist let go and then go and go
back to being rigorous yeah and formal

8172
02:22:29,110 --> 02:22:29,120
back to being rigorous yeah and formal
 

8173
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:30,710
back to being rigorous yeah and formal
and then and then every once in a while

8174
02:22:30,710 --> 02:22:30,720
and then and then every once in a while
 

8175
02:22:30,720 --> 02:22:32,790
and then and then every once in a while
let go it's the difference between

8176
02:22:32,790 --> 02:22:32,800
let go it's the difference between
 

8177
02:22:32,800 --> 02:22:34,070
let go it's the difference between
mathematics

8178
02:22:34,070 --> 02:22:34,080
mathematics
 

8179
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:35,510
mathematics
the maths

8180
02:22:35,510 --> 02:22:35,520
the maths
 

8181
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:36,870
the maths
and the uh

8182
02:22:36,870 --> 02:22:36,880
and the uh
 

8183
02:22:36,880 --> 02:22:40,630
and the uh
um poetry anyway um yeah i'm a big fan

8184
02:22:40,630 --> 02:22:40,640
um poetry anyway um yeah i'm a big fan
 

8185
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:42,150
um poetry anyway um yeah i'm a big fan
of sam harrison i think and i think you

8186
02:22:42,150 --> 02:22:42,160
of sam harrison i think and i think you
 

8187
02:22:42,160 --> 02:22:44,150
of sam harrison i think and i think you
know i think we're um we're on the same

8188
02:22:44,150 --> 02:22:44,160
know i think we're um we're on the same
 

8189
02:22:44,160 --> 02:22:45,990
know i think we're um we're on the same
page in in terms of consciousness i

8190
02:22:45,990 --> 02:22:46,000
page in in terms of consciousness i
 

8191
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,550
page in in terms of consciousness i
think um pretty much i mean i'm not

8192
02:22:48,550 --> 02:22:48,560
think um pretty much i mean i'm not
 

8193
02:22:48,560 --> 02:22:50,150
think um pretty much i mean i'm not
saying he's a pan psychist but in our

8194
02:22:50,150 --> 02:22:50,160
saying he's a pan psychist but in our
 

8195
02:22:50,160 --> 02:22:52,309
saying he's a pan psychist but in our
understanding of the hard problem

8196
02:22:52,309 --> 02:22:52,319
understanding of the hard problem
 

8197
02:22:52,319 --> 02:22:53,429
understanding of the hard problem
um

8198
02:22:53,429 --> 02:22:53,439
um
 

8199
02:22:53,439 --> 02:22:55,910
um
but yeah i i think maybe

8200
02:22:55,910 --> 02:22:55,920
but yeah i i think maybe
 

8201
02:22:55,920 --> 02:22:57,110
but yeah i i think maybe
we could talk about free will without

8202
02:22:57,110 --> 02:22:57,120
we could talk about free will without
 

8203
02:22:57,120 --> 02:22:59,510
we could talk about free will without
being too dragged down in the terminal i

8204
02:22:59,510 --> 02:22:59,520
being too dragged down in the terminal i
 

8205
02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:00,630
being too dragged down in the terminal i
don't know you said we need to be

8206
02:23:00,630 --> 02:23:00,640
don't know you said we need to be
 

8207
02:23:00,640 --> 02:23:02,230
don't know you said we need to be
open-minded but you could still have

8208
02:23:02,230 --> 02:23:02,240
open-minded but you could still have
 

8209
02:23:02,240 --> 02:23:05,670
open-minded but you could still have
intuitions about

8210
02:23:05,670 --> 02:23:05,680
intuitions about
 

8211
02:23:05,680 --> 02:23:07,270
intuitions about
so uh

8212
02:23:07,270 --> 02:23:07,280
so uh
 

8213
02:23:07,280 --> 02:23:09,030
so uh

harris is a pretty sort of uh

8216
02:23:11,030 --> 02:23:11,040
harris is a pretty sort of uh
 

8217
02:23:11,040 --> 02:23:12,870
harris is a pretty sort of uh
counterintuitive

8218
02:23:12,870 --> 02:23:12,880
counterintuitive
 

8219
02:23:12,880 --> 02:23:14,550
counterintuitive
and for some reason it gets people

8220
02:23:14,550 --> 02:23:14,560
and for some reason it gets people
 

8221
02:23:14,560 --> 02:23:17,429
and for some reason it gets people
really riled up a view of free will that

8222
02:23:17,429 --> 02:23:17,439
really riled up a view of free will that
 

8223
02:23:17,439 --> 02:23:18,870
really riled up a view of free will that
it's an illusion

8224
02:23:18,870 --> 02:23:18,880
it's an illusion
 

8225
02:23:18,880 --> 02:23:19,910
it's an illusion
um

8226
02:23:19,910 --> 02:23:19,920
um
 

8227
02:23:19,920 --> 02:23:23,590
um
or or it's not even an illusion like uh

8228
02:23:23,590 --> 02:23:23,600
or or it's not even an illusion like uh
 

8229
02:23:23,600 --> 02:23:25,349
or or it's not even an illusion like uh
it's it's not that the experience of

8230
02:23:25,349 --> 02:23:25,359
it's it's not that the experience of
 

8231
02:23:25,359 --> 02:23:26,790
it's it's not that the experience of
free will

8232
02:23:26,790 --> 02:23:26,800
free will
 

8233
02:23:26,800 --> 02:23:28,230
free will
is an illusion

8234
02:23:28,230 --> 02:23:28,240
is an illusion
 

8235
02:23:28,240 --> 02:23:30,150
is an illusion
is he argues that we don't even

8236
02:23:30,150 --> 02:23:30,160
is he argues that we don't even
 

8237
02:23:30,160 --> 02:23:31,590
is he argues that we don't even
experience

8238
02:23:31,590 --> 02:23:31,600
experience
 

8239
02:23:31,600 --> 02:23:33,990
experience
and like there's

8240
02:23:33,990 --> 02:23:34,000
and like there's
 

8241
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:35,110
and like there's
uh

8242
02:23:35,110 --> 02:23:35,120
uh
 

8243
02:23:35,120 --> 02:23:37,030
uh
to say that we even have the experience

8244
02:23:37,030 --> 02:23:37,040
to say that we even have the experience
 

8245
02:23:37,040 --> 02:23:38,550
to say that we even have the experience
is incorrect

8246
02:23:38,550 --> 02:23:38,560
is incorrect
 

8247
02:23:38,560 --> 02:23:40,230
is incorrect
that there's not even an experience of

8248
02:23:40,230 --> 02:23:40,240
that there's not even an experience of
 

8249
02:23:40,240 --> 02:23:42,469
that there's not even an experience of
free will

8250
02:23:42,469 --> 02:23:42,479
free will
 

8251
02:23:42,479 --> 02:23:45,030
free will
it's pretty interesting that that

8252
02:23:45,030 --> 02:23:45,040
it's pretty interesting that that
 

8253
02:23:45,040 --> 02:23:46,950
it's pretty interesting that that
that claim and it feels like you can

8254
02:23:46,950 --> 02:23:46,960
that claim and it feels like you can
 

8255
02:23:46,960 --> 02:23:49,270
that claim and it feels like you can
build up intuitions about what is

8256
02:23:49,270 --> 02:23:49,280
build up intuitions about what is
 

8257
02:23:49,280 --> 02:23:51,429
build up intuitions about what is
right and not you know there's been some

8258
02:23:51,429 --> 02:23:51,439
right and not you know there's been some
 

8259
02:23:51,439 --> 02:23:53,670
right and not you know there's been some
kind of neuroscience there's been some

8260
02:23:53,670 --> 02:23:53,680
kind of neuroscience there's been some
 

8261
02:23:53,680 --> 02:23:55,429
kind of neuroscience there's been some
cognitive science and

8262
02:23:55,429 --> 02:23:55,439
cognitive science and
 

8263
02:23:55,439 --> 02:23:58,070
cognitive science and
psychology experiments to sort of

8264
02:23:58,070 --> 02:23:58,080
psychology experiments to sort of
 

8265
02:23:58,080 --> 02:24:01,750
psychology experiments to sort of
see you know

8266
02:24:01,750 --> 02:24:01,760

 

8267
02:24:01,760 --> 02:24:03,910

what what is the timing and the origin

8268
02:24:03,910 --> 02:24:03,920
what what is the timing and the origin
 

8269
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:05,349
what what is the timing and the origin
of the

8270
02:24:05,349 --> 02:24:05,359
of the
 

8271
02:24:05,359 --> 02:24:07,190
of the
desire to make an action and when that

8272
02:24:07,190 --> 02:24:07,200
desire to make an action and when that
 

8273
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:08,790
desire to make an action and when that
action is actually performed and how you

8274
02:24:08,790 --> 02:24:08,800
action is actually performed and how you
 

8275
02:24:08,800 --> 02:24:10,790
action is actually performed and how you
interpret that action being performed

8276
02:24:10,790 --> 02:24:10,800
interpret that action being performed
 

8277
02:24:10,800 --> 02:24:12,950
interpret that action being performed
how you remember that action like all

8278
02:24:12,950 --> 02:24:12,960
how you remember that action like all
 

8279
02:24:12,960 --> 02:24:15,510
how you remember that action like all
the stories we tell ourselves all the

8280
02:24:15,510 --> 02:24:15,520
the stories we tell ourselves all the
 

8281
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:17,270
the stories we tell ourselves all the
neurochemicals involved in making a

8282
02:24:17,270 --> 02:24:17,280
neurochemicals involved in making a
 

8283
02:24:17,280 --> 02:24:19,110
neurochemicals involved in making a
thing happen all of that what's the

8284
02:24:19,110 --> 02:24:19,120
thing happen all of that what's the
 

8285
02:24:19,120 --> 02:24:20,389
thing happen all of that what's the
timing

8286
02:24:20,389 --> 02:24:20,399
timing
 

8287
02:24:20,399 --> 02:24:22,550
timing
and how does that connect with us uh

8288
02:24:22,550 --> 02:24:22,560
and how does that connect with us uh
 

8289
02:24:22,560 --> 02:24:24,550
and how does that connect with us uh
feeling like we decided to do something

8290
02:24:24,550 --> 02:24:24,560
feeling like we decided to do something
 

8291
02:24:24,560 --> 02:24:25,670
feeling like we decided to do something
and then of course there's a more

8292
02:24:25,670 --> 02:24:25,680
and then of course there's a more
 

8293
02:24:25,680 --> 02:24:28,950
and then of course there's a more
philosophical discussion about is there

8294
02:24:28,950 --> 02:24:28,960
philosophical discussion about is there
 

8295
02:24:28,960 --> 02:24:31,030
philosophical discussion about is there
room

8296
02:24:31,030 --> 02:24:31,040
room
 

8297
02:24:31,040 --> 02:24:34,790
room
in a material view of the world

8298
02:24:34,790 --> 02:24:34,800
in a material view of the world
 

8299
02:24:34,800 --> 02:24:38,230
in a material view of the world
for an entity that somehow disturbs the

8300
02:24:38,230 --> 02:24:38,240
for an entity that somehow disturbs the
 

8301
02:24:38,240 --> 02:24:40,070
for an entity that somehow disturbs the
determinism of physics

8302
02:24:40,070 --> 02:24:40,080
determinism of physics
 

8303
02:24:40,080 --> 02:24:41,190
determinism of physics
yeah

8304
02:24:41,190 --> 02:24:41,200
yeah
 

8305
02:24:41,200 --> 02:24:43,910
yeah
and uh yeah those are all very precise

8306
02:24:43,910 --> 02:24:43,920
and uh yeah those are all very precise
 

8307
02:24:43,920 --> 02:24:46,630
and uh yeah those are all very precise
it's nice it feels like free will

8308
02:24:46,630 --> 02:24:46,640
it's nice it feels like free will
 

8309
02:24:46,640 --> 02:24:49,190
it's nice it feels like free will
is more amenable to like a physics

8310
02:24:49,190 --> 02:24:49,200
is more amenable to like a physics
 

8311
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:51,190
is more amenable to like a physics

to to really get to the bottom of it

8316
02:24:54,790 --> 02:24:54,800
to to really get to the bottom of it
 

8317
02:24:54,800 --> 02:24:56,389
to to really get to the bottom of it
feels like if it was a race

8318
02:24:56,389 --> 02:24:56,399
feels like if it was a race
 

8319
02:24:56,399 --> 02:24:58,150
feels like if it was a race
if we're at a bar and we're betting

8320
02:24:58,150 --> 02:24:58,160

8321
02:24:58,160 --> 02:24:59,110

money

8322
02:24:59,110 --> 02:24:59,120

8323
02:24:59,120 --> 02:25:00,870
money
it feels like we'll get to the bottom of

8324
02:25:00,870 --> 02:25:00,880
it feels like we'll get to the bottom of
 

8325
02:25:00,880 --> 02:25:01,990
it feels like we'll get to the bottom of
our free will

8326
02:25:01,990 --> 02:25:02,000
our free will
 

8327
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:03,590
our free will
faster than we will to the bottom of

8328
02:25:03,590 --> 02:25:03,600
faster than we will to the bottom of
 

8329
02:25:03,600 --> 02:25:05,349
faster than we will to the bottom of
consciousness yeah that's interesting

8330
02:25:05,349 --> 02:25:05,359
consciousness yeah that's interesting
 

8331
02:25:05,359 --> 02:25:07,110
consciousness yeah that's interesting
yeah and thought about the comparison

8332
02:25:07,110 --> 02:25:07,120
yeah and thought about the comparison
 

8333
02:25:07,120 --> 02:25:08,630
yeah and thought about the comparison
yeah so they're different arguments here

8334
02:25:08,630 --> 02:25:08,640
yeah so they're different arguments here
 

8335
02:25:08,640 --> 02:25:10,469
yeah so they're different arguments here
i mean

8336
02:25:10,469 --> 02:25:10,479
i mean
 

8337
02:25:10,479 --> 02:25:12,230
i mean
so what one argument i've heard sam

8338
02:25:12,230 --> 02:25:12,240
so what one argument i've heard sam
 

8339
02:25:12,240 --> 02:25:14,469
so what one argument i've heard sam
harris give that's pretty common in

philosophy
 

8343
02:25:15,840 --> 02:25:17,830

and it just being
 

8353
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,469
and it just being
totally random and senseless like the

8354
02:25:30,469 --> 02:25:30,479
totally random and senseless like the
 

8355
02:25:30,479 --> 02:25:32,870
totally random and senseless like the

8359
02:25:34,319 --> 02:25:36,389
something
so i think there was a good answer to

8360
02:25:36,389 --> 02:25:36,399
so i think there was a good answer to
 

8361
02:25:36,399 --> 02:25:38,710
so i think there was a good answer to
that by uh the philosopher jonathan lowe

8419
02:26:32,960 --> 02:26:34,389
a decision so
so i think that is sufficient to

02:26:34,389 --> 02:26:34,399
so i think that is sufficient to

02:26:34,399 --> 02:26:36,630
so i think that is sufficient to

02:26:36,640 --> 02:26:37,990
distinguish it
um you know

8424
02:26:37,990 --> 02:26:38,000
um you know
 

8425
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:39,990
um you know
we're hypothetically supposing

8426
02:26:39,990 --> 02:26:40,000
we're hypothetically supposing

02:26:41,359 --> 02:26:42,870
trying to make sense of this idea not

8430
02:26:42,870 --> 02:26:42,880
saying it's real
 

8431
02:26:42,880 --> 02:26:44,630

but that could be
 

8433
02:26:44,640 --> 02:26:45,990
but that could be
enough to distinguish it from a

02:26:45,990 --> 02:26:46,000
enough to distinguish it from a

02:26:53,200 --> 02:26:55,270

um so i think that just answers that

8444
02:26:55,270 --> 02:26:55,280
um so i think that just answers that
 

8445
02:26:55,280 --> 02:26:57,190
um so i think that just answers that
that particular philosophical objection

8446

that particular philosophical objection
 

8447
02:26:57,200 --> 02:26:59,910

so what what is the middle way between

8448
02:26:59,910 --> 02:26:59,920
so what what is the middle way between
 

8449
02:26:59,920 --> 02:27:01,750
so what what is the middle way between
determined by prior causes and totally

8450
02:27:01,750 --> 02:27:01,760
determined by prior causes and totally
 

8451
02:27:01,760 --> 02:27:03,750
determined by prior causes and totally
random well there's an action a choice

8452
02:27:03,750 --> 02:27:03,760
random well there's an action a choice
 

8453
02:27:03,760 --> 02:27:05,830
random well there's an action a choice
that's not determined by prior causes

8454
02:27:05,830 --> 02:27:05,840
that's not determined by prior causes
 

8455
02:27:05,840 --> 02:27:08,389
that's not determined by prior causes
but it's not just random because it it

8456
02:27:08,389 --> 02:27:08,399
but it's not just random because it it
 

8457
02:27:08,399 --> 02:27:10,389
but it's not just random because it it

so that's the answer to that and i think

8462
02:27:14,230 --> 02:27:14,240
so that's the answer to that and i think
 

8463
02:27:14,240 --> 02:27:17,030
so that's the answer to that and i think
actually that kind of thought also i

02:27:24,870 --> 02:27:24,880
to
 

8473
02:27:24,880 --> 02:27:26,550
to
perform some kind of random action of

8474
02:27:26,550 --> 02:27:26,560
perform some kind of random action of
 

8475
02:27:26,560 --> 02:27:28,790
perform some kind of random action of
pressing a button and then note the time

8476
02:27:28,790 --> 02:27:28,800
pressing a button and then note the time
 

8477
02:27:28,800 --> 02:27:31,590
pressing a button and then note the time
they decided to press it quote unquote

8478
02:27:31,590 --> 02:27:31,600
they decided to press it quote unquote
 

8479
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:34,150
they decided to press it quote unquote
and then he's scanning the brains and he

8480
02:27:34,150 --> 02:27:34,160
and then he's scanning the brains and he
 

8481
02:27:34,160 --> 02:27:35,510
and then he's scanning the brains and he
claims

8482
02:27:35,510 --> 02:27:35,520
claims
 

8483
02:27:35,520 --> 02:27:37,190
claims
to have found that you know about half a

8484
02:27:37,190 --> 02:27:37,200
to have found that you know about half a
 

8485
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:39,429
to have found that you know about half a
second before they consciously decided

8486
02:27:39,429 --> 02:27:39,439
second before they consciously decided
 

8487
02:27:39,439 --> 02:27:40,710
second before they consciously decided
to press the button

8488
02:27:40,710 --> 02:27:40,720
to press the button
 

8489
02:27:40,720 --> 02:27:42,389
to press the button
the brain is

8490
02:27:42,389 --> 02:27:42,399
the brain is
 

8491
02:27:42,399 --> 02:27:44,870
the brain is
getting ready to perform that action so

8492
02:27:44,870 --> 02:27:44,880
getting ready to perform that action so
 

8493
02:27:44,880 --> 02:27:47,270
getting ready to perform that action so
he claimed that about half a second

8494
02:27:47,270 --> 02:27:47,280
he claimed that about half a second
 

8495
02:27:47,280 --> 02:27:49,030
he claimed that about half a second
before the person has consciously

8496
02:27:49,030 --> 02:27:49,040
before the person has consciously
 

8497
02:27:49,040 --> 02:27:51,030
before the person has consciously
decided to press the button the brain

8498
02:27:51,030 --> 02:27:51,040
decided to press the button the brain
 

8499
02:27:51,040 --> 02:27:53,670
decided to press the button the brain
has already started the activity that's

8500
02:27:53,670 --> 02:27:53,680
has already started the activity that's
 

8501
02:27:53,680 --> 02:27:55,429
has already started the activity that's
going to lead to the action

8502
02:27:55,429 --> 02:27:55,439
going to lead to the action
 

8503
02:27:55,439 --> 02:27:58,550
going to lead to the action
um and then later people have um

8504
02:27:58,550 --> 02:27:58,560
um and then later people have um
 

8505
02:27:58,560 --> 02:27:59,910
um and then later people have um
claimed that there's a difference of

02:27:59,910 --> 02:27:59,920
claimed that there's a difference of
 

8507
02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:02,309
claimed that there's a difference of
maybe seven to ten seconds i mean there

02:28:02,309 --> 02:28:02,319
maybe seven to ten seconds i mean there
 

8509
02:28:02,319 --> 02:28:03,910
maybe seven to ten seconds i mean there
are all sorts of issues with these

02:28:03,910 --> 02:28:03,920
are all sorts of issues with these

all of the quote-unquote choices they've
 

8519
02:28:11,520 --> 02:28:13,830
all of the quote-unquote choices they've
focused on are just these totally random

02:28:13,830 --> 02:28:13,840
focused on are just these totally random
 

8521
02:28:13,840 --> 02:28:15,590
focused on are just these totally random
senseless actions like just pressing a

02:28:15,590 --> 02:28:15,600
senseless actions like just pressing a
 

8523
02:28:15,600 --> 02:28:17,349
senseless actions like just pressing a

button for no reason and i think the
 

8525
02:28:17,359 --> 02:28:19,590

kind of free will we're interested in

8526
02:28:19,590 --> 02:28:19,600
kind of free will we're interested in
 

8527
02:28:19,600 --> 02:28:21,670
kind of free will we're interested in
is free choice that involves

is free choice that involves

02:28:21,680 --> 02:28:23,910
is free choice that involves
responsiveness to reasons weighing up

02:28:23,910 --> 02:28:23,920
responsiveness to reasons weighing up
 

8531
02:28:23,920 --> 02:28:25,429

considerations
 

8533
02:28:25,439 --> 02:28:26,790

and and those kind of free decisions

02:28:26,790 --> 02:28:26,800
and and those kind of free decisions
 

8535
02:28:26,800 --> 02:28:29,349
and and those kind of free decisions
might not happen like at an identifiable

02:28:29,349 --> 02:28:29,359
might not happen like at an identifiable
 

8537
02:28:29,359 --> 02:28:31,110
might not happen like at an identifiable
instant you might when you're weighing

02:28:31,110 --> 02:28:31,120

02:28:31,120 --> 02:28:33,190

it up should i get married should i you

8540
02:28:33,190 --> 02:28:33,200
it up should i get married should i you
 

8541
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:34,309
it up should i get married should i you
know you

8542
02:28:34,309 --> 02:28:34,319
know you
 

8543
02:28:34,319 --> 02:28:37,030
know you
you might edge slowly towards one side

8544
02:28:37,030 --> 02:28:37,040
you might edge slowly towards one side
 

8545
02:28:37,040 --> 02:28:38,950
you might edge slowly towards one side
or the other

8546
02:28:38,950 --> 02:28:38,960
or the other
 

8547
02:28:38,960 --> 02:28:42,230
or the other
and so it could it could be that

8548
02:28:42,230 --> 02:28:42,240
and so it could it could be that
 

8549
02:28:42,240 --> 02:28:43,590
and so it could it could be that
maybe the liberty i think there are

8550
02:28:43,590 --> 02:28:43,600
maybe the liberty i think there are
 

8551
02:28:43,600 --> 02:28:44,790
maybe the liberty i think there are
other problems with the liberty stuff

8552
02:28:44,790 --> 02:28:44,800
other problems with the liberty stuff
 

8553
02:28:44,800 --> 02:28:48,389
other problems with the liberty stuff
but maybe they show that we can't

8554
02:28:48,389 --> 02:28:48,399
but maybe they show that we can't
 

8555
02:28:48,399 --> 02:28:50,309
but maybe they show that we can't
freely choose to do something totally

8556
02:28:50,309 --> 02:28:50,319
freely choose to do something totally
 

8557
02:28:50,319 --> 02:28:52,469
freely choose to do something totally
senseless whatever that would mean

02:28:52,469 --> 02:28:52,479
senseless whatever that would mean
 

8559
02:28:52,479 --> 02:28:53,590
senseless whatever that would mean
um

8560
02:28:53,590 --> 02:28:53,600
um
 

8561
02:28:53,600 --> 02:28:55,990
um
but but that doesn't show we can't

8562
02:28:55,990 --> 02:28:56,000
but but that doesn't show we can't

02:28:59,349 --> 02:28:59,359
um in this strong libertarian sense

02:28:59,359 --> 02:29:01,429
um in this strong libertarian sense
respond to considerations of reason and

um
 

8573
02:29:03,680 --> 02:29:05,190
um
to be fair it would be difficult to see

8574
02:29:05,190 --> 02:29:05,200
to be fair it would be difficult to see
 

8575
02:29:05,200 --> 02:29:07,429
to be fair it would be difficult to see
what kind of experiment we could set up

8576
02:29:07,429 --> 02:29:07,439
what kind of experiment we could set up
 

8577
02:29:07,439 --> 02:29:08,790
what kind of experiment we could set up
to uh

8578
02:29:08,790 --> 02:29:08,800
to uh
 

8579
02:29:08,800 --> 02:29:11,750
to uh
test that but just because

8580
02:29:11,750 --> 02:29:11,760
test that but just because
 

8581
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:13,190
test that but just because
we can't yet set up that kind of

8582
02:29:13,190 --> 02:29:13,200
we can't yet set up that kind of
 

8583
02:29:13,200 --> 02:29:14,710
we can't yet set up that kind of
experiment we shouldn't you know pretend

8584
02:29:14,710 --> 02:29:14,720
experiment we shouldn't you know pretend
 

8585
02:29:14,720 --> 02:29:16,790
experiment we shouldn't you know pretend
we know more than we do so yeah so for

8586
02:29:16,790 --> 02:29:16,800
we know more than we do so yeah so for
 

8587
02:29:16,800 --> 02:29:18,790
we know more than we do so yeah so for
those reasons i don't i i and that well

8588
02:29:18,790 --> 02:29:18,800
those reasons i don't i i and that well
 

8589
02:29:18,800 --> 02:29:20,309
those reasons i don't i i and that well
the third consideration you raise is

8590
02:29:20,309 --> 02:29:20,319
the third consideration you raise is
 

8591
02:29:20,319 --> 02:29:22,710
the third consideration you raise is
different again this is the debate i

8592
02:29:22,710 --> 02:29:22,720
different again this is the debate i
 

8593
02:29:22,720 --> 02:29:24,469
different again this is the debate i
have with sean carroll

8594
02:29:24,469 --> 02:29:24,479
have with sean carroll
 

8595
02:29:24,479 --> 02:29:26,469
have with sean carroll
would this conflict with physics

8596
02:29:26,469 --> 02:29:26,479
would this conflict with physics
 

8597
02:29:26,479 --> 02:29:27,990
would this conflict with physics
i just think we don't know enough about

8598
02:29:27,990 --> 02:29:28,000
i just think we don't know enough about
 

8599
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,389
i just think we don't know enough about
the brain to know whether there are

8600
02:29:30,389 --> 02:29:30,399
the brain to know whether there are
 

8601
02:29:30,399 --> 02:29:32,710
the brain to know whether there are
causal dynamics in the brain that are

8602
02:29:32,710 --> 02:29:32,720
causal dynamics in the brain that are
 

8603
02:29:32,720 --> 02:29:35,670
causal dynamics in the brain that are
not reducible to underlying

8604
02:29:35,670 --> 02:29:35,680
not reducible to underlying
 

8605
02:29:35,680 --> 02:29:38,710
not reducible to underlying
chemistry and physics and

8606
02:29:38,710 --> 02:29:38,720
chemistry and physics and
 

8607
02:29:38,720 --> 02:29:40,870
chemistry and physics and
so so then sean carroll says well that

8608
02:29:40,870 --> 02:29:40,880
so so then sean carroll says well that
 

8609
02:29:40,880 --> 02:29:42,710
so so then sean carroll says well that
would mean

8610
02:29:42,710 --> 02:29:42,720
would mean
 

8611
02:29:42,720 --> 02:29:45,830
would mean
our physics is wrong so he focuses on

8612
02:29:45,830 --> 02:29:45,840
our physics is wrong so he focuses on
 

8613
02:29:45,840 --> 02:29:48,389
our physics is wrong so he focuses on
the core theory which is the name for

8614
02:29:48,389 --> 02:29:48,399
the core theory which is the name for
 

8615
02:29:48,399 --> 02:29:52,150
the core theory which is the name for
standard model of particle physics plus

8616
02:29:52,150 --> 02:29:52,160
standard model of particle physics plus
 

8617
02:29:52,160 --> 02:29:54,070
standard model of particle physics plus
the weak limit of general relativity so

8618
02:29:54,070 --> 02:29:54,080
the weak limit of general relativity so
 

8619
02:29:54,080 --> 02:29:57,190
the weak limit of general relativity so
you know we can't totally bring

8620
02:29:57,190 --> 02:29:57,200
you know we can't totally bring
 

8621
02:29:57,200 --> 02:29:58,550
you know we can't totally bring
quantum mechanics and relativity

8622
02:29:58,550 --> 02:29:58,560
quantum mechanics and relativity
 

8623
02:29:58,560 --> 02:30:01,030
quantum mechanics and relativity
together but actually that

8624
02:30:01,030 --> 02:30:01,040
together but actually that
 

8625
02:30:01,040 --> 02:30:02,710
together but actually that
the circumstances in which we can't

8626
02:30:02,710 --> 02:30:02,720
the circumstances in which we can't
 

8627
02:30:02,720 --> 02:30:05,590
the circumstances in which we can't
bring them together are just in

8628
02:30:05,590 --> 02:30:05,600
bring them together are just in
 

8629
02:30:05,600 --> 02:30:07,429
bring them together are just in
situations of very high gravity for

8630
02:30:07,429 --> 02:30:07,439
situations of very high gravity for
 

8631
02:30:07,439 --> 02:30:08,630
situations of very high gravity for
example when you're about to go into a

8632
02:30:08,630 --> 02:30:08,640
example when you're about to go into a
 

8633
02:30:08,640 --> 02:30:10,230
example when you're about to go into a

02:30:10,230 --> 02:30:10,240
black hole or something actually in
 

8635
02:30:10,240 --> 02:30:12,630
black hole or something actually in
terrestrial circumstances

8636
02:30:12,630 --> 02:30:12,640
terrestrial circumstances
 

8637
02:30:12,640 --> 02:30:14,389
terrestrial circumstances
we can bring them together in in the

8638
02:30:14,389 --> 02:30:14,399
we can bring them together in in the
 

8639
02:30:14,399 --> 02:30:17,349
we can bring them together in in the
core theory and then sean wants to say

8640
02:30:17,349 --> 02:30:17,359
core theory and then sean wants to say
 

8641
02:30:17,359 --> 02:30:18,950
core theory and then sean wants to say
well we're we can be very confident that

8642
02:30:18,950 --> 02:30:18,960
well we're we can be very confident that
 

8643
02:30:18,960 --> 02:30:21,750
well we're we can be very confident that
core theory is correct and so

8644
02:30:21,750 --> 02:30:21,760
core theory is correct and so
 

8645
02:30:21,760 --> 02:30:23,030
core theory is correct and so
um

8646
02:30:23,030 --> 02:30:23,040
um
 

8647
02:30:23,040 --> 02:30:25,190
um
if there were libertarian free will in

8648
02:30:25,190 --> 02:30:25,200
if there were libertarian free will in
 

8649
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:27,190
if there were libertarian free will in
the brain the core theory would be wrong

8650
02:30:27,190 --> 02:30:27,200
the brain the core theory would be wrong
 

8651
02:30:27,200 --> 02:30:28,790
the brain the core theory would be wrong
and okay this i mean this is something

8652
02:30:28,790 --> 02:30:28,800
and okay this i mean this is something
 

8653
02:30:28,800 --> 02:30:29,750
and okay this i mean this is something
i'm

8654
02:30:29,750 --> 02:30:29,760
i'm
 

8655
02:30:29,760 --> 02:30:31,590
i'm
i'm not sure about and i'm still

8656
02:30:31,590 --> 02:30:31,600
i'm not sure about and i'm still
 

8657
02:30:31,600 --> 02:30:33,349
i'm not sure about and i'm still
thinking about and i'm having i'm

8658
02:30:33,349 --> 02:30:33,359
thinking about and i'm having i'm
 

8659
02:30:33,359 --> 02:30:35,270
thinking about and i'm having i'm
learning from my discussion with sean

8660
02:30:35,270 --> 02:30:35,280
learning from my discussion with sean
 

8661
02:30:35,280 --> 02:30:38,230
learning from my discussion with sean
but i'm still not totally clear why

8662
02:30:38,230 --> 02:30:38,240
but i'm still not totally clear why
 

8663
02:30:38,240 --> 02:30:40,309
but i'm still not totally clear why
it could be suppose we did discover

8664
02:30:40,309 --> 02:30:40,319
it could be suppose we did discover
 

8665
02:30:40,319 --> 02:30:41,750
it could be suppose we did discover
strong emergence in the brain whether

8666
02:30:41,750 --> 02:30:41,760
strong emergence in the brain whether
 

8667
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:43,590
strong emergence in the brain whether
it's free will or something else

8668
02:30:43,590 --> 02:30:43,600
it's free will or something else
 

8669
02:30:43,600 --> 02:30:45,590
it's free will or something else
perhaps what we would say is not that

8670
02:30:45,590 --> 02:30:45,600
perhaps what we would say is not that
 

8671
02:30:45,600 --> 02:30:48,230
perhaps what we would say is not that
the core theory is wrong but we'd say

8672
02:30:48,230 --> 02:30:48,240
the core theory is wrong but we'd say
 

8673
02:30:48,240 --> 02:30:52,389
the core theory is wrong but we'd say
uh the core theory is

8674
02:30:52,389 --> 02:30:52,399
uh the core theory is
 

8675
02:30:52,399 --> 02:30:55,030
uh the core theory is
correct in its own terms namely

8676
02:30:55,030 --> 02:30:55,040
correct in its own terms namely
 

8677
02:30:55,040 --> 02:30:58,550
correct in its own terms namely
capturing the causal capacities of

8678
02:30:58,550 --> 02:30:58,560
capturing the causal capacities of
 

8679
02:30:58,560 --> 02:31:00,550
capturing the causal capacities of
particles and fields

8680
02:31:00,550 --> 02:31:00,560
particles and fields
 

8681
02:31:00,560 --> 02:31:02,230
particles and fields
but then it's a further assumption

8682
02:31:02,230 --> 02:31:02,240
but then it's a further assumption
 

8683
02:31:02,240 --> 02:31:03,429
but then it's a further assumption
whether they're the only things that are

8684
02:31:03,429 --> 02:31:03,439
whether they're the only things that are
 

8685
02:31:03,439 --> 02:31:06,389
whether they're the only things that are
running the show maybe there are also

8686
02:31:06,389 --> 02:31:06,399
running the show maybe there are also
 

8687
02:31:06,399 --> 02:31:08,469
running the show maybe there are also
fundamental causal capacities associated

8688
02:31:08,469 --> 02:31:08,479
fundamental causal capacities associated
 

8689
02:31:08,479 --> 02:31:09,270
fundamental causal capacities associated
with

02:31:09,270 --> 02:31:09,280
with

systems
 

8693
02:31:10,800 --> 02:31:12,389
systems
and then if we discover this strong

8694
02:31:12,389 --> 02:31:12,399
and then if we discover this strong
 

8695
02:31:12,399 --> 02:31:13,830
and then if we discover this strong
emergence then when we work out what

8696
02:31:13,830 --> 02:31:13,840
emergence then when we work out what
 

8697
02:31:13,840 --> 02:31:15,510
emergence then when we work out what
happens in the brain we have to look to

8698
02:31:15,510 --> 02:31:15,520
happens in the brain we have to look to
 

8699
02:31:15,520 --> 02:31:17,910
happens in the brain we have to look to
the core theory the causal capacities of

8700
02:31:17,910 --> 02:31:17,920
the core theory the causal capacities of
 

8701
02:31:17,920 --> 02:31:19,910
the core theory the causal capacities of
particles and fields

8702
02:31:19,910 --> 02:31:19,920
particles and fields
 

8703
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:21,429
particles and fields
and we have to look to what we know

8704
02:31:21,429 --> 02:31:21,439
and we have to look to what we know
 

8705
02:31:21,439 --> 02:31:23,270
and we have to look to what we know
about these strongly emerging causal

8706
02:31:23,270 --> 02:31:23,280
about these strongly emerging causal
 

8707
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:25,510
about these strongly emerging causal
capacities of systems and maybe they

8708
02:31:25,510 --> 02:31:25,520
capacities of systems and maybe they
 

8709
02:31:25,520 --> 02:31:28,070
capacities of systems and maybe they
co-determine what happens in the system

8710
02:31:28,070 --> 02:31:28,080
co-determine what happens in the system
 

8711
02:31:28,080 --> 02:31:29,030
co-determine what happens in the system
um

8712
02:31:29,030 --> 02:31:29,040
um
 

8713
02:31:29,040 --> 02:31:30,950
um
so i don't know whether that makes sense

8714
02:31:30,950 --> 02:31:30,960
so i don't know whether that makes sense
 

8715
02:31:30,960 --> 02:31:32,790
so i don't know whether that makes sense
or not but i mean the more important

8716
02:31:32,790 --> 02:31:32,800
or not but i mean the more important
 

8717
02:31:32,800 --> 02:31:34,230
or not but i mean the more important
point i mean that's in a way a kind of

8718
02:31:34,230 --> 02:31:34,240
point i mean that's in a way a kind of
 

8719
02:31:34,240 --> 02:31:36,230
point i mean that's in a way a kind of
branding point how we brand this the

8720
02:31:36,230 --> 02:31:36,240
branding point how we brand this the
 

8721
02:31:36,240 --> 02:31:37,670
branding point how we brand this the
more important point is we just don't

8722
02:31:37,670 --> 02:31:37,680
more important point is we just don't
 

8723
02:31:37,680 --> 02:31:38,950
more important point is we just don't
know enough about the workings of the

8724
02:31:38,950 --> 02:31:38,960
know enough about the workings of the
 

8725
02:31:38,960 --> 02:31:43,349
know enough about the workings of the
brain to know whether there are

8726
02:31:43,349 --> 02:31:43,359
brain to know whether there are
 

8727
02:31:43,359 --> 02:31:45,110
brain to know whether there are
strongly emergent causal dynamics

8728
02:31:45,110 --> 02:31:45,120
strongly emergent causal dynamics
 

8729
02:31:45,120 --> 02:31:46,389
strongly emergent causal dynamics
whether or not

8730
02:31:46,389 --> 02:31:46,399
whether or not
 

8731
02:31:46,399 --> 02:31:48,469
whether or not
that would mean we have to modify

8732
02:31:48,469 --> 02:31:48,479
that would mean we have to modify
 

8733
02:31:48,479 --> 02:31:50,469
that would mean we have to modify
physics or maybe just we think physics

8734
02:31:50,469 --> 02:31:50,479
physics or maybe just we think physics
 

8735
02:31:50,479 --> 02:31:52,630
physics or maybe just we think physics
is not the total story of what's running

8736
02:31:52,630 --> 02:31:52,640
is not the total story of what's running
 

8737
02:31:52,640 --> 02:31:55,190
is not the total story of what's running
the show but we just

8738
02:31:55,190 --> 02:31:55,200
the show but we just
 

8739
02:31:55,200 --> 02:31:57,349
the show but we just
if it turned out

8740
02:31:57,349 --> 02:31:57,359
if it turned out
 

8741
02:31:57,359 --> 02:31:59,429
if it turned out
empirically that everything's reducible

8742
02:31:59,429 --> 02:31:59,439
empirically that everything's reducible
 

8743
02:31:59,439 --> 02:32:01,429
empirically that everything's reducible
to underlying physics and chemistry sure

8744
02:32:01,429 --> 02:32:01,439
to underlying physics and chemistry sure
 

8745
02:32:01,439 --> 02:32:02,710
to underlying physics and chemistry sure
i would drop

8746
02:32:02,710 --> 02:32:02,720
i would drop
 

8747
02:32:02,720 --> 02:32:04,630
i would drop
any commitment to free libertarian free

8748
02:32:04,630 --> 02:32:04,640
any commitment to free libertarian free
 

8749
02:32:04,640 --> 02:32:07,190
any commitment to free libertarian free
will in a in a heartbeat it's an

8750
02:32:07,190 --> 02:32:07,200
will in a in a heartbeat it's an
 

8751
02:32:07,200 --> 02:32:09,190
will in a in a heartbeat it's an
empirical question maybe that's why as

8752
02:32:09,190 --> 02:32:09,200
empirical question maybe that's why as
 

8753
02:32:09,200 --> 02:32:11,429
empirical question maybe that's why as
you say it in principle is easier to get

8754
02:32:11,429 --> 02:32:11,439
you say it in principle is easier to get
 

8755
02:32:11,439 --> 02:32:13,830
you say it in principle is easier to get
a grip on but we're a million miles away

8756
02:32:13,830 --> 02:32:13,840
a grip on but we're a million miles away
 

8757
02:32:13,840 --> 02:32:15,349
a grip on but we're a million miles away
from being at that stage well i don't

8758
02:32:15,349 --> 02:32:15,359
from being at that stage well i don't
 

8759
02:32:15,359 --> 02:32:17,110
from being at that stage well i don't
know for a million miles i hope we're

8760
02:32:17,110 --> 02:32:17,120
know for a million miles i hope we're
 

8761
02:32:17,120 --> 02:32:18,790
know for a million miles i hope we're
not because one of the ways i think to

8762
02:32:18,790 --> 02:32:18,800
not because one of the ways i think to
 

8763
02:32:18,800 --> 02:32:19,990
not because one of the ways i think to
get to it

8764
02:32:19,990 --> 02:32:20,000
get to it
 

8765
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,870
get to it
is by engineering systems so yeah my

8766
02:32:22,870 --> 02:32:22,880
is by engineering systems so yeah my
 

8767
02:32:22,880 --> 02:32:25,670
is by engineering systems so yeah my
hope is uh to understand intelligence by

8768
02:32:25,670 --> 02:32:25,680
hope is uh to understand intelligence by
 

8769
02:32:25,680 --> 02:32:27,429
hope is uh to understand intelligence by
building intelligent systems to

8770
02:32:27,429 --> 02:32:27,439
building intelligent systems to
 

8771
02:32:27,439 --> 02:32:29,030
building intelligent systems to
understand consciousness

8772
02:32:29,030 --> 02:32:29,040
understand consciousness
 

8773
02:32:29,040 --> 02:32:30,070
understand consciousness
by

8774
02:32:30,070 --> 02:32:30,080
by
 

8775
02:32:30,080 --> 02:32:31,910
by
building systems that

8776
02:32:31,910 --> 02:32:31,920
building systems that
 

8777
02:32:31,920 --> 02:32:34,150
building systems that
let's say the easy thing which is not

8778
02:32:34,150 --> 02:32:34,160
let's say the easy thing which is not
 

8779
02:32:34,160 --> 02:32:35,910
let's say the easy thing which is not
the easy thing but the first thing which

8780
02:32:35,910 --> 02:32:35,920
the easy thing but the first thing which
 

8781
02:32:35,920 --> 02:32:39,270
the easy thing but the first thing which
is to try to uh

8782
02:32:39,270 --> 02:32:39,280
is to try to uh
 

8783
02:32:39,280 --> 02:32:41,910
is to try to uh
create the illusion of consciousness

8784
02:32:41,910 --> 02:32:41,920
create the illusion of consciousness
 

8785
02:32:41,920 --> 02:32:43,270
create the illusion of consciousness
through that process i think you start

8786
02:32:43,270 --> 02:32:43,280
through that process i think you start
 

8787
02:32:43,280 --> 02:32:44,790
through that process i think you start
to understand much more about

8788
02:32:44,790 --> 02:32:44,800
to understand much more about
 

8789
02:32:44,800 --> 02:32:46,950
to understand much more about
consciousness about intelligence and

8790
02:32:46,950 --> 02:32:46,960
consciousness about intelligence and
 

8791
02:32:46,960 --> 02:32:48,389
consciousness about intelligence and
then the same with free will i think

8792
02:32:48,389 --> 02:32:48,399
then the same with free will i think
 

8793
02:32:48,399 --> 02:32:51,110
then the same with free will i think
those are all tied very closely together

8794
02:32:51,110 --> 02:32:51,120
those are all tied very closely together
 

8795
02:32:51,120 --> 02:32:53,270
those are all tied very closely together
as at least from our narrow human

8796
02:32:53,270 --> 02:32:53,280
as at least from our narrow human
 

8797
02:32:53,280 --> 02:32:55,510
as at least from our narrow human
perspective and we try to engineer

8798
02:32:55,510 --> 02:32:55,520
perspective and we try to engineer
 

8799
02:32:55,520 --> 02:32:58,309
perspective and we try to engineer
systems that interact deeply with humans

8800
02:32:58,309 --> 02:32:58,319
systems that interact deeply with humans
 

8801
02:32:58,319 --> 02:33:00,630
systems that interact deeply with humans
that form friends with humans that

8802
02:33:00,630 --> 02:33:00,640
that form friends with humans that
 

8803
02:33:00,640 --> 02:33:02,950
that form friends with humans that
humans fall in love with and they fall

8804
02:33:02,950 --> 02:33:02,960
humans fall in love with and they fall
 

8805
02:33:02,960 --> 02:33:05,270
humans fall in love with and they fall
in love with humans

8806
02:33:05,270 --> 02:33:05,280
in love with humans
 

8807
02:33:05,280 --> 02:33:07,990
in love with humans
then you start to uh have to

8808
02:33:07,990 --> 02:33:08,000
then you start to uh have to
 

8809
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:11,030
then you start to uh have to
try to deeply understand ourselves uh to

8810
02:33:11,030 --> 02:33:11,040
try to deeply understand ourselves uh to
 

8811
02:33:11,040 --> 02:33:13,110
try to deeply understand ourselves uh to
try to deeply understand

8812
02:33:13,110 --> 02:33:13,120
try to deeply understand
 

8813
02:33:13,120 --> 02:33:15,030
try to deeply understand
what is intelligence in the human mind

8814
02:33:15,030 --> 02:33:15,040
what is intelligence in the human mind
 

8815
02:33:15,040 --> 02:33:17,429
what is intelligence in the human mind
what is consciousness what is free will

8816
02:33:17,429 --> 02:33:17,439
what is consciousness what is free will
 

8817
02:33:17,439 --> 02:33:19,110
what is consciousness what is free will
and i think engineering is just another

8818
02:33:19,110 --> 02:33:19,120
and i think engineering is just another
 

8819
02:33:19,120 --> 02:33:20,710
and i think engineering is just another
way to do

8820
02:33:20,710 --> 02:33:20,720
way to do
 

8821
02:33:20,720 --> 02:33:22,950
way to do
to do uh philosophy

8822
02:33:22,950 --> 02:33:22,960
to do uh philosophy
 

8823
02:33:22,960 --> 02:33:24,790
to do uh philosophy
yeah no i certainly think there's

8824
02:33:24,790 --> 02:33:24,800
yeah no i certainly think there's
 

8825
02:33:24,800 --> 02:33:26,309
yeah no i certainly think there's
there's a role for that and it would be

8826
02:33:26,309 --> 02:33:26,319
there's a role for that and it would be
 

8827
02:33:26,319 --> 02:33:29,750
there's a role for that and it would be
an important consideration if we could

8828
02:33:29,750 --> 02:33:29,760
an important consideration if we could
 

8829
02:33:29,760 --> 02:33:32,870
an important consideration if we could
seemingly replicate in an artificial way

8830
02:33:32,870 --> 02:33:32,880
seemingly replicate in an artificial way
 

8831
02:33:32,880 --> 02:33:35,190
seemingly replicate in an artificial way
um

8832
02:33:35,190 --> 02:33:35,200
um
 

8833
02:33:35,200 --> 02:33:37,750
um
the

8834
02:33:37,750 --> 02:33:37,760

 

8835
02:33:37,760 --> 02:33:39,750

ability to choose

8836
02:33:39,750 --> 02:33:39,760
ability to choose
 

8837
02:33:39,760 --> 02:33:40,630
ability to choose
um

8838
02:33:40,630 --> 02:33:40,640
um
 

8839
02:33:40,640 --> 02:33:41,910
um
that would be

8840
02:33:41,910 --> 02:33:41,920
that would be
 

8841
02:33:41,920 --> 02:33:43,990
that would be
a consideration in thinking about these

8842
02:33:43,990 --> 02:33:44,000
a consideration in thinking about these
 

8843
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:45,830
a consideration in thinking about these
things but there's still a question of

8844
02:33:45,830 --> 02:33:45,840
things but there's still a question of
 

8845
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:48,710
things but there's still a question of
whether that's how we do it so even if

8846
02:33:48,710 --> 02:33:48,720
whether that's how we do it so even if
 

8847
02:33:48,720 --> 02:33:50,710
whether that's how we do it so even if
we could we could

8848
02:33:50,710 --> 02:33:50,720
we could we could
 

8849
02:33:50,720 --> 02:33:52,389
we could we could
replicate behavior in a certain way in

8850
02:33:52,389 --> 02:33:52,399
replicate behavior in a certain way in
 

8851
02:33:52,399 --> 02:33:55,110
replicate behavior in a certain way in
an artificial system this it's not until

8852
02:33:55,110 --> 02:33:55,120
an artificial system this it's not until
 

8853
02:33:55,120 --> 02:33:56,710
an artificial system this it's not until
we understand the workings of our brains

8854
02:33:56,710 --> 02:33:56,720
we understand the workings of our brains
 

8855
02:33:56,720 --> 02:33:59,270
we understand the workings of our brains
it's not clear that's how we do it and

8856
02:33:59,270 --> 02:33:59,280
it's not clear that's how we do it and
 

8857
02:33:59,280 --> 02:34:01,030
it's not clear that's how we do it and
as i say i mean the kind of free will

8858
02:34:01,030 --> 02:34:01,040
as i say i mean the kind of free will
 

8859
02:34:01,040 --> 02:34:03,670
as i say i mean the kind of free will
i'm interested in is where we

8860
02:34:03,670 --> 02:34:03,680
i'm interested in is where we
 

8861
02:34:03,680 --> 02:34:05,510
i'm interested in is where we
respond to

8862
02:34:05,510 --> 02:34:05,520
respond to
 

8863
02:34:05,520 --> 02:34:08,230
respond to
reasons considerations of value how

8864
02:34:08,230 --> 02:34:08,240
reasons considerations of value how
 

8865
02:34:08,240 --> 02:34:11,030
reasons considerations of value how
would we tell whether a system was

8866
02:34:11,030 --> 02:34:11,040
would we tell whether a system was
 

8867
02:34:11,040 --> 02:34:13,110
would we tell whether a system was
genuinely

8868
02:34:13,110 --> 02:34:13,120
genuinely
 

8869
02:34:13,120 --> 02:34:16,870
genuinely
responding grasping and responding to

8870
02:34:16,870 --> 02:34:16,880
responding grasping and responding to
 

8871
02:34:16,880 --> 02:34:18,950
responding grasping and responding to
uh facts about value or whether they

8872
02:34:18,950 --> 02:34:18,960
uh facts about value or whether they
 

8873
02:34:18,960 --> 02:34:22,150
uh facts about value or whether they
were just

8874
02:34:22,150 --> 02:34:22,160

 

8875
02:34:22,160 --> 02:34:25,030

replicating giving the impression of of

02:34:25,030 --> 02:34:25,040
replicating giving the impression of of
 

8877
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:27,510
replicating giving the impression of of
doing so um

8878
02:34:27,510 --> 02:34:27,520
doing so um
 

8879
02:34:27,520 --> 02:34:29,190
doing so um
i don't know even how to think about

8880
02:34:29,190 --> 02:34:29,200
i don't know even how to think about
 

8881
02:34:29,200 --> 02:34:31,429
i don't know even how to think about
that on the process to building them i

8882
02:34:31,429 --> 02:34:31,439
that on the process to building them i
 

8883
02:34:31,439 --> 02:34:33,429
that on the process to building them i
think we'll get a lot of insights and

8884
02:34:33,429 --> 02:34:33,439
think we'll get a lot of insights and
 

8885
02:34:33,439 --> 02:34:35,590
think we'll get a lot of insights and
once they become

8886
02:34:35,590 --> 02:34:35,600
once they become
 

8887
02:34:35,600 --> 02:34:37,110
once they become
conscious

8888
02:34:37,110 --> 02:34:37,120
conscious
 

8889
02:34:37,120 --> 02:34:38,630
conscious
what's going to happen is exactly the

8890
02:34:38,630 --> 02:34:38,640
what's going to happen is exactly the
 

8891
02:34:38,640 --> 02:34:40,630
what's going to happen is exactly the
same thing is happening in chess now

8892
02:34:40,630 --> 02:34:40,640
same thing is happening in chess now
 

8893
02:34:40,640 --> 02:34:43,270
same thing is happening in chess now
which is once the chess

8894
02:34:43,270 --> 02:34:43,280
which is once the chess
 

8895
02:34:43,280 --> 02:34:45,110
which is once the chess
engines far

8896
02:34:45,110 --> 02:34:45,120
engines far
 

8897
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:47,190
engines far
superseded the the

8898
02:34:47,190 --> 02:34:47,200
superseded the the
 

8899
02:34:47,200 --> 02:34:49,590
superseded the the
capabilities of humans humans just kind

8900
02:34:49,590 --> 02:34:49,600
capabilities of humans humans just kind
 

8901
02:34:49,600 --> 02:34:51,590
capabilities of humans humans just kind
of forgot about them or they use them to

8902
02:34:51,590 --> 02:34:51,600
of forgot about them or they use them to
 

8903
02:34:51,600 --> 02:34:53,510
of forgot about them or they use them to
help them out to study and stuff but we

8904
02:34:53,510 --> 02:34:53,520
help them out to study and stuff but we
 

8905
02:34:53,520 --> 02:34:54,230
help them out to study and stuff but we
still

8906
02:34:54,230 --> 02:34:54,240
still
 

8907
02:34:54,240 --> 02:34:56,389
still
we say okay let the engines be and then

8908
02:34:56,389 --> 02:34:56,399
we say okay let the engines be and then
 

8909
02:34:56,399 --> 02:34:57,990
we say okay let the engines be and then
we humans will just play amongst each

8910
02:34:57,990 --> 02:34:58,000
we humans will just play amongst each
 

8911
02:34:58,000 --> 02:34:59,270
we humans will just play amongst each
other right

8912
02:34:59,270 --> 02:34:59,280
other right
 

8913
02:34:59,280 --> 02:35:00,469
other right
so

8914
02:35:00,469 --> 02:35:00,479
so
 

8915
02:35:00,479 --> 02:35:03,429
so
just like uh dolphins and hamsters

8916
02:35:03,429 --> 02:35:03,439
just like uh dolphins and hamsters
 

8917
02:35:03,439 --> 02:35:05,349
just like uh dolphins and hamsters
are not so concerned about humans except

8918
02:35:05,349 --> 02:35:05,359
are not so concerned about humans except
 

8919
02:35:05,359 --> 02:35:06,870
are not so concerned about humans except
for a source of food

8920
02:35:06,870 --> 02:35:06,880
for a source of food
 

8921
02:35:06,880 --> 02:35:09,349
for a source of food
uh you know they do their own thing and

8922
02:35:09,349 --> 02:35:09,359
uh you know they do their own thing and
 

8923
02:35:09,359 --> 02:35:11,750
uh you know they do their own thing and
let us humans launch rockets into space

8924
02:35:11,750 --> 02:35:11,760
let us humans launch rockets into space
 

8925
02:35:11,760 --> 02:35:14,070
let us humans launch rockets into space
and all that kind of stuff they don't

8926
02:35:14,070 --> 02:35:14,080
and all that kind of stuff they don't
 

8927
02:35:14,080 --> 02:35:15,510
and all that kind of stuff they don't
they don't care i think we'll just focus

8928
02:35:15,510 --> 02:35:15,520
they don't care i think we'll just focus
 

8929
02:35:15,520 --> 02:35:18,150
they don't care i think we'll just focus
on ourselves but in the process of

8930
02:35:18,150 --> 02:35:18,160
on ourselves but in the process of
 

8931
02:35:18,160 --> 02:35:20,389
on ourselves but in the process of
building intelligent systems conscious

8932
02:35:20,389 --> 02:35:20,399
building intelligent systems conscious
 

8933
02:35:20,399 --> 02:35:23,030
building intelligent systems conscious
systems i think we'll get to get a

8934
02:35:23,030 --> 02:35:23,040
systems i think we'll get to get a
 

8935
02:35:23,040 --> 02:35:26,309
systems i think we'll get to get a
deeper understanding of

8936
02:35:26,309 --> 02:35:26,319
deeper understanding of
 

8937
02:35:26,319 --> 02:35:28,710
deeper understanding of
of uh the role of consciousness in in

8938
02:35:28,710 --> 02:35:28,720
of uh the role of consciousness in in
 

8939
02:35:28,720 --> 02:35:31,190
of uh the role of consciousness in in
the human mind and like what what uh

8940
02:35:31,190 --> 02:35:31,200
the human mind and like what what uh
 

8941
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:32,870
the human mind and like what what uh
what are its origins is it the base

8942
02:35:32,870 --> 02:35:32,880
what are its origins is it the base
 

8943
02:35:32,880 --> 02:35:34,309
what are its origins is it the base
layer of reality

8944
02:35:34,309 --> 02:35:34,319
layer of reality
 

8945
02:35:34,319 --> 02:35:37,190
layer of reality
is it uh strongly emerging phenomena of

8946
02:35:37,190 --> 02:35:37,200
is it uh strongly emerging phenomena of
 

8947
02:35:37,200 --> 02:35:39,750
is it uh strongly emerging phenomena of
the brain or just as you sort of

8948
02:35:39,750 --> 02:35:39,760
the brain or just as you sort of
 

8949
02:35:39,760 --> 02:35:42,710
the brain or just as you sort of
brilliantly put here it could be both

8950
02:35:42,710 --> 02:35:42,720
brilliantly put here it could be both
 

8951
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:44,469
brilliantly put here it could be both
like they're not mutually exclusive

8952
02:35:44,469 --> 02:35:44,479
like they're not mutually exclusive
 

8953
02:35:44,479 --> 02:35:45,910
like they're not mutually exclusive
dealing with consciousness needs to be

8954
02:35:45,910 --> 02:35:45,920
dealing with consciousness needs to be
 

8955
02:35:45,920 --> 02:35:47,910
dealing with consciousness needs to be
an interdisciplinary task we need you

8956
02:35:47,910 --> 02:35:47,920
an interdisciplinary task we need you
 

8957
02:35:47,920 --> 02:35:49,349
an interdisciplinary task we need you
know

8958
02:35:49,349 --> 02:35:49,359
know
 

8959
02:35:49,359 --> 02:35:50,870
know
philosophers

8960
02:35:50,870 --> 02:35:50,880
philosophers
 

8961
02:35:50,880 --> 02:35:55,830
philosophers
neuroscientists physicists um engineers

8962
02:35:55,830 --> 02:35:55,840
neuroscientists physicists um engineers
 

8963
02:35:55,840 --> 02:35:57,670

replicating these things artificially

8964
02:35:57,670 --> 02:35:57,680
replicating these things artificially
 

8965
02:35:57,680 --> 02:35:58,710
replicating these things artificially
and

8966
02:35:58,710 --> 02:35:58,720
and
 

8967
02:35:58,720 --> 02:36:01,429
and
all needs to be working in in step and

8968
02:36:01,429 --> 02:36:01,439
all needs to be working in in step and
 

8969
02:36:01,439 --> 02:36:03,190
all needs to be working in in step and
um you know i'm i'm quite interested i

8970
02:36:03,190 --> 02:36:03,200
um you know i'm i'm quite interested i
 

8971
02:36:03,200 --> 02:36:04,469
um you know i'm i'm quite interested i
mean a lot

8972
02:36:04,469 --> 02:36:04,479
mean a lot
 

8973
02:36:04,479 --> 02:36:05,910
mean a lot
more and more scientists get in touch

8974
02:36:05,910 --> 02:36:05,920
more and more scientists get in touch
 

8975
02:36:05,920 --> 02:36:09,110
more and more scientists get in touch
with me actually you know saying um that

8976
02:36:09,110 --> 02:36:09,120
with me actually you know saying um that
 

8977
02:36:09,120 --> 02:36:10,309
with me actually you know saying um that
was one of the great things about i

8978
02:36:10,309 --> 02:36:10,319
was one of the great things about i
 

8979
02:36:10,319 --> 02:36:12,150
was one of the great things about i
think that's come from writing a popular

02:36:12,150 --> 02:36:12,160
think that's come from writing a popular
 

8981
02:36:12,160 --> 02:36:12,950

book
 

8983
02:36:12,960 --> 02:36:14,630
book
is not not just getting the ideas out to

8984
02:36:14,630 --> 02:36:14,640
is not not just getting the ideas out to
 

8985
02:36:14,640 --> 02:36:15,990
is not not just getting the ideas out to
a general audience but getting the ideas

8986
02:36:15,990 --> 02:36:16,000
a general audience but getting the ideas
 

8987
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:17,510
a general audience but getting the ideas
out to scientists and i would scientists

8988
02:36:17,510 --> 02:36:17,520
out to scientists and i would scientists
 

8989
02:36:17,520 --> 02:36:19,510
out to scientists and i would scientists
get in touch saying no this in some way

8990
02:36:19,510 --> 02:36:19,520
get in touch saying no this in some way
 

8991
02:36:19,520 --> 02:36:21,510
get in touch saying no this in some way
connects to my work and i would like to

8992
02:36:21,510 --> 02:36:21,520
connects to my work and i would like to
 

8993
02:36:21,520 --> 02:36:24,150
connects to my work and i would like to
kind of start to put together a network

8994
02:36:24,150 --> 02:36:24,160
kind of start to put together a network
 

8995
02:36:24,160 --> 02:36:27,349
kind of start to put together a network
of an interdisciplinary network of

8996
02:36:27,349 --> 02:36:27,359
of an interdisciplinary network of
 

8997
02:36:27,359 --> 02:36:28,710
of an interdisciplinary network of
scientists and philosophers and

8998
02:36:28,710 --> 02:36:28,720
scientists and philosophers and
 

8999
02:36:28,720 --> 02:36:30,630
scientists and philosophers and
engineers perhaps you know

9000
02:36:30,630 --> 02:36:30,640
engineers perhaps you know
 

9001
02:36:30,640 --> 02:36:32,469
engineers perhaps you know
interested in

9002
02:36:32,469 --> 02:36:32,479
interested in
 

9003
02:36:32,479 --> 02:36:34,389
interested in
a pan cyclist approach and because i

9004
02:36:34,389 --> 02:36:34,399
a pan cyclist approach and because i
 

9005
02:36:34,399 --> 02:36:36,710
a pan cyclist approach and because i
think so far psychism has just been sort

9006
02:36:36,710 --> 02:36:36,720
think so far psychism has just been sort
 

9007
02:36:36,720 --> 02:36:39,030
think so far psychism has just been sort
of trying to justify its existence

9008
02:36:39,030 --> 02:36:39,040
of trying to justify its existence
 

9009
02:36:39,040 --> 02:36:40,630
of trying to justify its existence
and that's important but i think once

9010
02:36:40,630 --> 02:36:40,640
and that's important but i think once
 

9011
02:36:40,640 --> 02:36:42,389
and that's important but i think once
you just get on with an active research

9012
02:36:42,389 --> 02:36:42,399
you just get on with an active research
 

9013
02:36:42,399 --> 02:36:43,429
you just get on with an active research
program

9014
02:36:43,429 --> 02:36:43,439
program
 

9015
02:36:43,439 --> 02:36:45,190
program
that's when people start taking it

9016
02:36:45,190 --> 02:36:45,200
that's when people start taking it
 

9017
02:36:45,200 --> 02:36:48,469
that's when people start taking it
seriously i think

9018
02:36:48,469 --> 02:36:48,479

 

9019
02:36:48,479 --> 02:36:49,510

do you think we're living in a

9020
02:36:49,510 --> 02:36:49,520
do you think we're living in a
 

9021
02:36:49,520 --> 02:36:53,349
do you think we're living in a
simulation

9022
02:36:53,349 --> 02:36:53,359

 

9023
02:36:53,359 --> 02:36:54,309

no

9024
02:36:54,309 --> 02:36:54,319
no
 

9025
02:36:54,319 --> 02:36:56,469
no
i think um

9026
02:36:56,469 --> 02:36:56,479
i think um
 

9027
02:36:56,479 --> 02:36:58,070
i think um
is there some aspect to that thought

9028
02:36:58,070 --> 02:36:58,080
is there some aspect to that thought
 

9029
02:36:58,080 --> 02:36:59,830
is there some aspect to that thought
experiment that's compelling to you

9030
02:36:59,830 --> 02:36:59,840
experiment that's compelling to you
 

9031
02:36:59,840 --> 02:37:02,230
experiment that's compelling to you
within the framework of uh

9032
02:37:02,230 --> 02:37:02,240
within the framework of uh
 

9033
02:37:02,240 --> 02:37:03,510
within the framework of uh
pan psychism

9034
02:37:03,510 --> 02:37:03,520
pan psychism
 

9035
02:37:03,520 --> 02:37:06,070
pan psychism
it's an important and

9036
02:37:06,070 --> 02:37:06,080
it's an important and
 

9037
02:37:06,080 --> 02:37:07,670
it's an important and
serious argument

9038
02:37:07,670 --> 02:37:07,680
serious argument
 

9039
02:37:07,680 --> 02:37:10,070
serious argument
and um you know it's not to be laughed

9040
02:37:10,070 --> 02:37:10,080
and um you know it's not to be laughed
 

9041
02:37:10,080 --> 02:37:12,309
and um you know it's not to be laughed
away i suppose one issue i have with it

9042
02:37:12,309 --> 02:37:12,319
away i suppose one issue i have with it
 

9043
02:37:12,319 --> 02:37:14,950
away i suppose one issue i have with it
is

9044
02:37:14,950 --> 02:37:14,960

 

9045
02:37:14,960 --> 02:37:16,389

there's a there's a crucial assumption

9046
02:37:16,389 --> 02:37:16,399
there's a there's a crucial assumption
 

9047
02:37:16,399 --> 02:37:18,070
there's a there's a crucial assumption
there that consciousness is substrate

9048
02:37:18,070 --> 02:37:18,080
there that consciousness is substrate
 

9049
02:37:18,080 --> 02:37:20,389
there that consciousness is substrate
independent as the jargon goes which

9050
02:37:20,389 --> 02:37:20,399
independent as the jargon goes which
 

9051
02:37:20,399 --> 02:37:23,270
independent as the jargon goes which
means it it it's what no right be

9052
02:37:23,270 --> 02:37:23,280
means it it it's what no right be
 

9053
02:37:23,280 --> 02:37:25,190
means it it it's what no right be
beautifully put yeah it's software

9054
02:37:25,190 --> 02:37:25,200
beautifully put yeah it's software
 

9055
02:37:25,200 --> 02:37:26,870
beautifully put yeah it's software
rather than hardware right it's depend

9056
02:37:26,870 --> 02:37:26,880
rather than hardware right it's depend
 

9057
02:37:26,880 --> 02:37:29,830
rather than hardware right it's depend
on organization rather than the stuff

9058
02:37:29,830 --> 02:37:29,840
on organization rather than the stuff
 

9059
02:37:29,840 --> 02:37:31,270
on organization rather than the stuff
whereas as a pan psychist i think

9060
02:37:31,270 --> 02:37:31,280
whereas as a pan psychist i think
 

9061
02:37:31,280 --> 02:37:33,349
whereas as a pan psychist i think
consciousness is the stuff of the brain

9062
02:37:33,349 --> 02:37:33,359
consciousness is the stuff of the brain
 

9063
02:37:33,359 --> 02:37:35,270
consciousness is the stuff of the brain
it's the stuff of matter

9064
02:37:35,270 --> 02:37:35,280
it's the stuff of matter
 

9065
02:37:35,280 --> 02:37:36,950
it's the stuff of matter
so i think just taking the

9066
02:37:36,950 --> 02:37:36,960
so i think just taking the
 

9067
02:37:36,960 --> 02:37:39,110
so i think just taking the
organizational properties the software

9068
02:37:39,110 --> 02:37:39,120
organizational properties the software
 

9069
02:37:39,120 --> 02:37:41,830
organizational properties the software
in my brain and uploading them

9070
02:37:41,830 --> 02:37:41,840
in my brain and uploading them
 

9071
02:37:41,840 --> 02:37:43,429
in my brain and uploading them
you wouldn't get the stuff on my brain

9072
02:37:43,429 --> 02:37:43,439
you wouldn't get the stuff on my brain
 

9073
02:37:43,439 --> 02:37:45,590
you wouldn't get the stuff on my brain
so i actually worried if at some point

9074
02:37:45,590 --> 02:37:45,600
so i actually worried if at some point
 

9075
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:48,070
so i actually worried if at some point
in the future we start uploading our

9076
02:37:48,070 --> 02:37:48,080
in the future we start uploading our
 

9077
02:37:48,080 --> 02:37:50,790
in the future we start uploading our
minds and we think oh my god granny's

9078
02:37:50,790 --> 02:37:50,800
minds and we think oh my god granny's
 

9079
02:37:50,800 --> 02:37:52,150
minds and we think oh my god granny's
still there or you know i can email

9080
02:37:52,150 --> 02:37:52,160
still there or you know i can email
 

9081
02:37:52,160 --> 02:37:54,469
still there or you know i can email
granny after her body's rotted in the

9082
02:37:54,469 --> 02:37:54,479
granny after her body's rotted in the
 

9083
02:37:54,479 --> 02:37:56,309
granny after her body's rotted in the
ground and you know and we all start

9084
02:37:56,309 --> 02:37:56,319
ground and you know and we all start
 

9085
02:37:56,319 --> 02:37:58,230
ground and you know and we all start
uploading our brains it could be we're

9086
02:37:58,230 --> 02:37:58,240
uploading our brains it could be we're
 

9087
02:37:58,240 --> 02:38:00,469
uploading our brains it could be we're
just committing suicide we're just

9088
02:38:00,469 --> 02:38:00,479
just committing suicide we're just
 

9089
02:38:00,479 --> 02:38:03,429
just committing suicide we're just
getting rid of our consciousness and um

9090
02:38:03,429 --> 02:38:03,439
getting rid of our consciousness and um
 

9091
02:38:03,439 --> 02:38:04,630
getting rid of our consciousness and um
because i think you know that that

9092
02:38:04,630 --> 02:38:04,640
because i think you know that that
 

9093
02:38:04,640 --> 02:38:05,670
because i think you know that that
wouldn't

9094
02:38:05,670 --> 02:38:05,680
wouldn't
 

9095
02:38:05,680 --> 02:38:07,349
wouldn't
for me preserve

9096
02:38:07,349 --> 02:38:07,359
for me preserve
 

9097
02:38:07,359 --> 02:38:09,590
for me preserve
the experience just just getting the

9098
02:38:09,590 --> 02:38:09,600
the experience just just getting the
 

9099
02:38:09,600 --> 02:38:11,190
the experience just just getting the
software features

9100
02:38:11,190 --> 02:38:11,200
software features
 

9101
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:12,070
software features
um

9102
02:38:12,070 --> 02:38:12,080
um
 

9103
02:38:12,080 --> 02:38:13,990
um
so that's a crucial but that's anyway

9104
02:38:13,990 --> 02:38:14,000
so that's a crucial but that's anyway
 

9105
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:15,270
so that's a crucial but that's anyway
that's a crucial premise of the

9106
02:38:15,270 --> 02:38:15,280
that's a crucial premise of the
 

9107
02:38:15,280 --> 02:38:17,349
that's a crucial premise of the
simulation argument because the idea in

9108
02:38:17,349 --> 02:38:17,359
simulation argument because the idea in
 

9109
02:38:17,359 --> 02:38:19,110
simulation argument because the idea in
a simulated universe

9110
02:38:19,110 --> 02:38:19,120
a simulated universe
 

9111
02:38:19,120 --> 02:38:20,309
a simulated universe
i don't i don't think he necessarily

9112
02:38:20,309 --> 02:38:20,319
i don't i don't think he necessarily
 

9113
02:38:20,319 --> 02:38:21,910
i don't i don't think he necessarily
would have consciousness it's

9114
02:38:21,910 --> 02:38:21,920
would have consciousness it's
 

9115
02:38:21,920 --> 02:38:23,670
would have consciousness it's
interesting that you as a parent

9116
02:38:23,670 --> 02:38:23,680
interesting that you as a parent
 

9117
02:38:23,680 --> 02:38:24,870
interesting that you as a parent
psychist

9118
02:38:24,870 --> 02:38:24,880
psychist
 

9119
02:38:24,880 --> 02:38:29,510
psychist
are attached because to me

9120
02:38:29,510 --> 02:38:29,520

 

9121
02:38:29,520 --> 02:38:32,309

pan psychism would encourage

9122
02:38:32,309 --> 02:38:32,319
pan psychism would encourage
 

9123
02:38:32,319 --> 02:38:34,550
pan psychism would encourage
the thought that there's not a

9124
02:38:34,550 --> 02:38:34,560
the thought that there's not a
 

9125
02:38:34,560 --> 02:38:36,630
the thought that there's not a
significant difference

9126
02:38:36,630 --> 02:38:36,640
significant difference
 

9127
02:38:36,640 --> 02:38:38,230
significant difference
like

9128
02:38:38,230 --> 02:38:38,240
like
 

9129
02:38:38,240 --> 02:38:40,870
like
at the very bottom it's not

9130
02:38:40,870 --> 02:38:40,880
at the very bottom it's not
 

9131
02:38:40,880 --> 02:38:43,190
at the very bottom it's not
substrate independent

9132
02:38:43,190 --> 02:38:43,200
substrate independent
 

9133
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:45,990
substrate independent
but uh you can have consciousness in a

9134
02:38:45,990 --> 02:38:46,000
but uh you can have consciousness in a
 

9135
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,790
but uh you can have consciousness in a
human and then move it to something else

9136
02:38:48,790 --> 02:38:48,800
human and then move it to something else
 

9137
02:38:48,800 --> 02:38:51,030
human and then move it to something else
uh you can move it to the cloud you can

9138
02:38:51,030 --> 02:38:51,040
uh you can move it to the cloud you can
 

9139
02:38:51,040 --> 02:38:52,710
uh you can move it to the cloud you can
move it to the computer

9140
02:38:52,710 --> 02:38:52,720
move it to the computer
 

9141
02:38:52,720 --> 02:38:55,429
move it to the computer
it feels like that's much more possible

9142
02:38:55,429 --> 02:38:55,439
it feels like that's much more possible
 

9143
02:38:55,439 --> 02:38:58,230
it feels like that's much more possible
if consciousness is the base layer

9144
02:38:58,230 --> 02:38:58,240
if consciousness is the base layer
 

9145
02:38:58,240 --> 02:39:01,429
if consciousness is the base layer
yes you could certainly

9146
02:39:01,429 --> 02:39:01,439
yes you could certainly
 

9147
02:39:01,439 --> 02:39:04,550
yes you could certainly
it allows for the possibility of

9148
02:39:04,550 --> 02:39:04,560
it allows for the possibility of
 

9149
02:39:04,560 --> 02:39:06,230
it allows for the possibility of
creating artificial consciousness right

9150
02:39:06,230 --> 02:39:06,240
creating artificial consciousness right
 

9151
02:39:06,240 --> 02:39:07,270
creating artificial consciousness right
because then

9152
02:39:07,270 --> 02:39:07,280
because then
 

9153
02:39:07,280 --> 02:39:09,190
because then
there's not souls there aren't any any

9154
02:39:09,190 --> 02:39:09,200
there's not souls there aren't any any
 

9155
02:39:09,200 --> 02:39:11,270
there's not souls there aren't any any
kind of extra magical ingredients so

9156
02:39:11,270 --> 02:39:11,280
kind of extra magical ingredients so
 

9157
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:13,030
kind of extra magical ingredients so
yeah it's definitely allows the

9158
02:39:13,030 --> 02:39:13,040
yeah it's definitely allows the
 

9159
02:39:13,040 --> 02:39:15,030
yeah it's definitely allows the
possibility of artificial consciousness

9160
02:39:15,030 --> 02:39:15,040
possibility of artificial consciousness
 

9161
02:39:15,040 --> 02:39:17,590
possibility of artificial consciousness
and maybe preserving my consciousness in

9162
02:39:17,590 --> 02:39:17,600
and maybe preserving my consciousness in
 

9163
02:39:17,600 --> 02:39:19,750
and maybe preserving my consciousness in
some sort of artificial way my only

9164
02:39:19,750 --> 02:39:19,760
some sort of artificial way my only
 

9165
02:39:19,760 --> 02:39:21,110
some sort of artificial way my only
point i suppose was

9166
02:39:21,110 --> 02:39:21,120
point i suppose was
 

9167
02:39:21,120 --> 02:39:22,630
point i suppose was
is just

9168
02:39:22,630 --> 02:39:22,640
is just
 

9169
02:39:22,640 --> 02:39:25,510
is just
just replicating the computational or

9170
02:39:25,510 --> 02:39:25,520
just replicating the computational or
 

9171
02:39:25,520 --> 02:39:28,150
just replicating the computational or
organizational features

9172
02:39:28,150 --> 02:39:28,160
organizational features
 

9173
02:39:28,160 --> 02:39:30,309
organizational features
would not for me preserve consciousness

9174
02:39:30,309 --> 02:39:30,319
would not for me preserve consciousness
 

9175
02:39:30,319 --> 02:39:32,550
would not for me preserve consciousness
i mean that but antifa some some

9176
02:39:32,550 --> 02:39:32,560
i mean that but antifa some some
 

9177
02:39:32,560 --> 02:39:34,230
i mean that but antifa some some
opponents of materialism disagree with

9178
02:39:34,230 --> 02:39:34,240
opponents of materialism disagree with
 

9179
02:39:34,240 --> 02:39:35,670
opponents of materialism disagree with
me on that i think david chalmers is an

02:39:35,670 --> 02:39:35,680
me on that i think david chalmers is an
 

9181
02:39:35,680 --> 02:39:37,670
me on that i think david chalmers is an
opponent materialist he's a kind of

9182
02:39:37,670 --> 02:39:37,680
opponent materialist he's a kind of
 

9183
02:39:37,680 --> 02:39:40,550
opponent materialist he's a kind of
duelist but he thinks

9184
02:39:40,550 --> 02:39:40,560
duelist but he thinks
 

9185
02:39:40,560 --> 02:39:43,349
duelist but he thinks
the way these psychophysical laws work

9186
02:39:43,349 --> 02:39:43,359
the way these psychophysical laws work
 

9187
02:39:43,359 --> 02:39:45,110
the way these psychophysical laws work
they hook on to the

9188
02:39:45,110 --> 02:39:45,120
they hook on to the
 

9189
02:39:45,120 --> 02:39:47,110
they hook on to the
computational or organizational features

9190
02:39:47,110 --> 02:39:47,120
computational or organizational features

02:39:47,120 --> 02:39:49,110
computational or organizational features
of mata so he thinks you know i think he

9192
02:39:49,110 --> 02:39:49,120
of mata so he thinks you know i think he
 

9193
02:39:49,120 --> 02:39:50,469
of mata so he thinks you know i think he
thinks you you could upload your

thinks you you could upload your
 

9195
02:39:50,479 --> 02:39:52,950
thinks you you could upload your
consciousness um

9196
02:39:52,950 --> 02:39:52,960
consciousness um
 

9197
02:39:52,960 --> 02:39:55,030
consciousness um
i tend to think not so

9198
02:39:55,030 --> 02:39:55,040
i tend to think not so
 

9199
02:39:55,040 --> 02:39:56,389
i tend to think not so
in that sense

9200
02:39:56,389 --> 02:39:56,399
in that sense
 

9201
02:39:56,399 --> 02:39:57,750
in that sense
in that sense we're now living in a

9202
02:39:57,750 --> 02:39:57,760
in that sense we're now living in a
 

9203
02:39:57,760 --> 02:39:58,950
in that sense we're now living in a
simulation

9204
02:39:58,950 --> 02:39:58,960
simulation
 

9205
02:39:58,960 --> 02:40:01,910
simulation
in the sort of uh specific computational

9206
02:40:01,910 --> 02:40:01,920
in the sort of uh specific computational
 

9207
02:40:01,920 --> 02:40:03,349
in the sort of uh specific computational
view of things

9208
02:40:03,349 --> 02:40:03,359
view of things
 

9209
02:40:03,359 --> 02:40:06,309
view of things
in that substrate matters to you yeah i

9210
02:40:06,309 --> 02:40:06,319
in that substrate matters to you yeah i
 

9211
02:40:06,319 --> 02:40:08,230
in that substrate matters to you yeah i
think so yeah yeah

9212
02:40:08,230 --> 02:40:08,240
think so yeah yeah
 

9213
02:40:08,240 --> 02:40:09,830
think so yeah yeah
and in that you agree with sean carroll

9214
02:40:09,830 --> 02:40:09,840
and in that you agree with sean carroll
 

9215
02:40:09,840 --> 02:40:12,550
and in that you agree with sean carroll
that physics matters

9216
02:40:12,550 --> 02:40:12,560
that physics matters
 

9217
02:40:12,560 --> 02:40:15,190
that physics matters
yeah physics

9218
02:40:15,190 --> 02:40:15,200
yeah physics
 

9219
02:40:15,200 --> 02:40:17,830
yeah physics
is our best way of capturing

9220
02:40:17,830 --> 02:40:17,840
is our best way of capturing
 

9221
02:40:17,840 --> 02:40:20,070
is our best way of capturing
what the stuff of the world does yeah

9222
02:40:20,070 --> 02:40:20,080
what the stuff of the world does yeah
 

9223
02:40:20,080 --> 02:40:23,190
what the stuff of the world does yeah
but not the whatness the

9224
02:40:23,190 --> 02:40:23,200
but not the whatness the
 

9225
02:40:23,200 --> 02:40:25,670
but not the whatness the
the being of the stuff yeah the is-ness

9226
02:40:25,670 --> 02:40:25,680
the being of the stuff yeah the is-ness
 

9227
02:40:25,680 --> 02:40:27,830
the being of the stuff yeah the is-ness
the is-ness thank you um okay russell

9228
02:40:27,830 --> 02:40:27,840
the is-ness thank you um okay russell
 

9229
02:40:27,840 --> 02:40:29,750
the is-ness thank you um okay russell
brand i had a conversation with russell

9230
02:40:29,750 --> 02:40:29,760
brand i had a conversation with russell
 

9231
02:40:29,760 --> 02:40:32,309
brand i had a conversation with russell
brandon he said oh you mean the is-ness

9232
02:40:32,309 --> 02:40:32,319
brandon he said oh you mean the is-ness
 

9233
02:40:32,319 --> 02:40:34,630
brandon he said oh you mean the is-ness
that was a good way open it isn't this

9234
02:40:34,630 --> 02:40:34,640
that was a good way open it isn't this
 

9235
02:40:34,640 --> 02:40:35,910
that was a good way open it isn't this
business

9236
02:40:35,910 --> 02:40:35,920
business
 

9237
02:40:35,920 --> 02:40:37,590
business
great

9238
02:40:37,590 --> 02:40:37,600
great
 

9239
02:40:37,600 --> 02:40:39,510
great
the big ridiculous question

9240
02:40:39,510 --> 02:40:39,520
the big ridiculous question
 

9241
02:40:39,520 --> 02:40:41,110
the big ridiculous question
what do you think is the meaning of all

9242
02:40:41,110 --> 02:40:41,120
what do you think is the meaning of all
 

9243
02:40:41,120 --> 02:40:43,269
what do you think is the meaning of all
this uh you uh

9244
02:40:43,269 --> 02:40:43,279
this uh you uh
 

9245
02:40:43,279 --> 02:40:46,870
this uh you uh
you write in your book uh that the entry

9246
02:40:46,870 --> 02:40:46,880
you write in your book uh that the entry
 

9247
02:40:46,880 --> 02:40:48,950
you write in your book uh that the entry
for our reality in the hitchhiker's

might read a physical universe whose

9252
02:40:52,870 --> 02:40:52,880
might read a physical universe whose
 

9253
02:40:52,880 --> 02:40:55,510
might read a physical universe whose
intrinsic nature is constituted of

9254
02:40:55,510 --> 02:40:55,520
intrinsic nature is constituted of
 

9255
02:40:55,520 --> 02:40:57,190
intrinsic nature is constituted of
consciousness

9256
02:40:57,190 --> 02:40:57,200
consciousness
 

9257
02:40:57,200 --> 02:40:59,190
consciousness
worth a visit

9258
02:40:59,190 --> 02:40:59,200
worth a visit
 

9259
02:40:59,200 --> 02:41:00,830
worth a visit
so

9260
02:41:00,830 --> 02:41:00,840
so
 

9261
02:41:00,840 --> 02:41:02,469
so
our

9262
02:41:02,469 --> 02:41:02,479
our
 

9263
02:41:02,479 --> 02:41:03,910
our
whole conversation has been about the

9264
02:41:03,910 --> 02:41:03,920
whole conversation has been about the
 

9265
02:41:03,920 --> 02:41:06,469
whole conversation has been about the
first part of that sentence what about

9266
02:41:06,469 --> 02:41:06,479
first part of that sentence what about
 

9267
02:41:06,479 --> 02:41:07,990
first part of that sentence what about
the second part

9268
02:41:07,990 --> 02:41:08,000
the second part
 

9269
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:09,349
the second part
worth the visit

9270
02:41:09,349 --> 02:41:09,359
worth the visit
 

9271
02:41:09,359 --> 02:41:11,830
worth the visit
why is this place worth a visit

9272
02:41:11,830 --> 02:41:11,840
why is this place worth a visit
 

9273
02:41:11,840 --> 02:41:14,630
why is this place worth a visit
why does it have meaning

9274
02:41:14,630 --> 02:41:14,640
why does it have meaning
 

9275
02:41:14,640 --> 02:41:19,590
why does it have meaning
why does it have value at all why

9276
02:41:19,590 --> 02:41:19,600

 

9277
02:41:19,600 --> 02:41:22,389

these are big questions

9278
02:41:22,389 --> 02:41:22,399
these are big questions
 

9279
02:41:22,399 --> 02:41:25,349
these are big questions
i mean firstly i do think pan psychism

9280
02:41:25,349 --> 02:41:25,359
i mean firstly i do think pan psychism
 

9281
02:41:25,359 --> 02:41:26,230
i mean firstly i do think pan psychism
it

9282
02:41:26,230 --> 02:41:26,240
it
 

9283
02:41:26,240 --> 02:41:28,309
it
is important to think about four

9284
02:41:28,309 --> 02:41:28,319
is important to think about four
 

9285
02:41:28,319 --> 02:41:30,790
is important to think about four

i mean that's controversial but that's

02:41:56,389 --> 02:41:56,399
i mean that's controversial but that's
 

9311
02:41:56,399 --> 02:41:58,469
i mean that's controversial but that's
what i think and i think people feel

it's maybe part of what max weber called

the disenchantment of nature you know

9318
02:42:04,469 --> 02:42:04,479
the disenchantment of nature you know
 

9319
02:42:04,479 --> 02:42:06,630
the disenchantment of nature you know
that they think

9320
02:42:06,630 --> 02:42:06,640
that they think

02:42:06,640 --> 02:42:08,230
that they think

just electrochemical signaling i mean

9326
02:42:12,469 --> 02:42:12,479
just electrochemical signaling i mean
 

9327
02:42:12,479 --> 02:42:13,990
just electrochemical signaling i mean
they might just have that very informed

9328
02:42:13,990 --> 02:42:14,000
they might just have that very informed
 

9329
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:15,510
they might just have that very informed
intuition but i think that can be

9330
02:42:15,510 --> 02:42:15,520
intuition but i think that can be
 

9331
02:42:15,520 --> 02:42:17,830
intuition but i think that can be
rigorously supported so i think this can

9332
02:42:17,830 --> 02:42:17,840
rigorously supported so i think this can
 

9333
02:42:17,840 --> 02:42:20,870
rigorously supported so i think this can
lead to a sense of alienation and

9334
02:42:20,870 --> 02:42:20,880
lead to a sense of alienation and
 

9335
02:42:20,880 --> 02:42:23,750
lead to a sense of alienation and
a sense that we lack a framework

9336
02:42:23,750 --> 02:42:23,760
a sense that we lack a framework
 

9337
02:42:23,760 --> 02:42:25,269
a sense that we lack a framework
for understanding the meaning and

9338
02:42:25,269 --> 02:42:25,279
for understanding the meaning and
 

9339
02:42:25,279 --> 02:42:28,070
for understanding the meaning and
significance of our lives and

9340
02:42:28,070 --> 02:42:28,080
significance of our lives and
 

9341
02:42:28,080 --> 02:42:29,750
significance of our lives and
in the absence of that people turn to

9342
02:42:29,750 --> 02:42:29,760
in the absence of that people turn to
 

9343
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:30,870
in the absence of that people turn to
other things to make sense of the

9344
02:42:30,870 --> 02:42:30,880
other things to make sense of the
 

9345
02:42:30,880 --> 02:42:32,790
other things to make sense of the
meaning of their lives like you know

9346
02:42:32,790 --> 02:42:32,800

so i think pansysm is important in that

9352
02:42:38,630 --> 02:42:38,640
so i think pansysm is important in that
 

9353
02:42:38,640 --> 02:42:41,750
so i think pansysm is important in that

with the as it were the human truth by
you know by which i just mean the

02:42:48,309 --> 02:42:48,319
you know by which i just mean the
 

9361
02:42:48,319 --> 02:42:49,990
you know by which i just mean the
qualitative reality of our own

9362

um

9366
02:42:52,870 --> 02:42:52,880
um
 

9367
02:42:52,880 --> 02:42:54,469
um
as i've already said i do i do think

9368
02:42:54,469 --> 02:42:54,479
as i've already said i do i do think
 

9369
02:42:54,479 --> 02:42:56,790
as i've already said i do i do think
there are objective

9370
02:42:56,790 --> 02:42:56,800
there are objective
 

9371
02:42:56,800 --> 02:42:58,790
there are objective
facts about

9372
02:42:58,790 --> 02:42:58,800
facts about
 

9373
02:42:58,800 --> 02:43:00,710
facts about
value and

9374
02:43:00,710 --> 02:43:00,720
value and
 

9375
02:43:00,720 --> 02:43:02,389
value and
what we ought to do and what we ought to

9376
02:43:02,389 --> 02:43:02,399
what we ought to do and what we ought to
 

9377
02:43:02,399 --> 02:43:04,950
what we ought to do and what we ought to
believe that we respond to and that's

9378
02:43:04,950 --> 02:43:04,960
believe that we respond to and that's
 

9379
02:43:04,960 --> 02:43:07,030
believe that we respond to and that's
very mysterious to make sense of both

9380
02:43:07,030 --> 02:43:07,040
very mysterious to make sense of both
 

9381
02:43:07,040 --> 02:43:08,790
very mysterious to make sense of both
how there could be such facts and how we

9382
02:43:08,790 --> 02:43:08,800
how there could be such facts and how we
 

9383
02:43:08,800 --> 02:43:10,469
how there could be such facts and how we
could know about them and respond to

9384
02:43:10,469 --> 02:43:10,479
could know about them and respond to
 

9385
02:43:10,479 --> 02:43:11,830
could know about them and respond to
them but

9386
02:43:11,830 --> 02:43:11,840
them but
 

9387
02:43:11,840 --> 02:43:13,030
them but
um

9388
02:43:13,030 --> 02:43:13,040
um
 

9389
02:43:13,040 --> 02:43:15,110
um
i do think there are such facts and

9390
02:43:15,110 --> 02:43:15,120
i do think there are such facts and
 

9391
02:43:15,120 --> 02:43:16,630
i do think there are such facts and
they're mostly to do with kinds of

9392
02:43:16,630 --> 02:43:16,640
they're mostly to do with kinds of
 

9393
02:43:16,640 --> 02:43:18,309
they're mostly to do with kinds of
conscious experience

9394
02:43:18,309 --> 02:43:18,319
conscious experience
 

9395
02:43:18,319 --> 02:43:21,190
conscious experience
so they're there to be discovered and

9396
02:43:21,190 --> 02:43:21,200
so they're there to be discovered and
 

9397
02:43:21,200 --> 02:43:23,349
so they're there to be discovered and
much of the

9398
02:43:23,349 --> 02:43:23,359
much of the
 

9399
02:43:23,359 --> 02:43:25,510
much of the
human condition is to discover those

9400
02:43:25,510 --> 02:43:25,520
human condition is to discover those
 

9401
02:43:25,520 --> 02:43:28,389
human condition is to discover those
objective sources of value i think so

9402
02:43:28,389 --> 02:43:28,399
objective sources of value i think so
 

9403
02:43:28,399 --> 02:43:30,790
objective sources of value i think so
yeah and then i mean

9404
02:43:30,790 --> 02:43:30,800
yeah and then i mean
 

9405
02:43:30,800 --> 02:43:32,230
yeah and then i mean

02:43:32,240 --> 02:43:33,830
moving away from pancakes into the you
know

9408
02:43:33,830 --> 02:43:33,840
know
 

9409
02:43:33,840 --> 02:43:37,110
know
at an even bigger level i suppose i i

9410
02:43:37,110 --> 02:43:37,120
at an even bigger level i suppose i i
 

9411
02:43:37,120 --> 02:43:40,550
at an even bigger level i suppose i i
i think it is important to me

9412
02:43:40,550 --> 02:43:40,560

02:43:42,240 --> 02:43:43,910
to live in hope that there's a there's a
purpose to existence

9416
02:43:43,910 --> 02:43:43,920
purpose to existence
 

9417
02:43:43,920 --> 02:43:47,030
purpose to existence
and that you know what what i do

9418
02:43:47,030 --> 02:43:47,040
and that you know what what i do
 

9419
02:43:47,040 --> 02:43:49,269
and that you know what what i do
contributes in some small way to that

9420
02:43:49,269 --> 02:43:49,279
contributes in some small way to that
 

9421
02:43:49,279 --> 02:43:50,469
contributes in some small way to that
greater purpose

9422
02:43:50,469 --> 02:43:50,479
greater purpose
 

9423
02:43:50,479 --> 02:43:52,870
greater purpose
and but you know i

9424
02:43:52,870 --> 02:43:52,880
and but you know i
 

9425
02:43:52,880 --> 02:43:54,630
and but you know i
i would say i don't i don't know if

9426
02:43:54,630 --> 02:43:54,640
i would say i don't i don't know if
 

9427
02:43:54,640 --> 02:43:56,230
i would say i don't i don't know if
there's a purpose to existence i think

9428
02:43:56,230 --> 02:43:56,240
there's a purpose to existence i think
 

9429
02:43:56,240 --> 02:43:58,150
there's a purpose to existence i think
some some things point in that direction

9430
02:43:58,150 --> 02:43:58,160
some some things point in that direction

some things point away from it
but

9434
02:44:00,870 --> 02:44:00,880
but
 

9435
02:44:00,880 --> 02:44:03,429
but
i don't think you need certainty or even

9436
02:44:03,429 --> 02:44:03,439
i don't think you need certainty or even

i don't think you need certainty or even
