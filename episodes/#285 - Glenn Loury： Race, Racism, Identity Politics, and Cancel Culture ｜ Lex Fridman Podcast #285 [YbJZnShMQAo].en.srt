but i like to make the point that

1058
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:48,480

anywhere in human history it's certainly

1182
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:04,080
anywhere in human history it's certainly
 

1183
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,270
anywhere in human history it's certainly
um worth celebrating the achievement of

1184
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:07,280
um worth celebrating the achievement of
 

1185

and it probably started with a few
 

1189
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,470

inside their mind dared to rebel
 

1195
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,630
inside their mind dared to rebel
you know it's interesting to think about

1196
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:20,640
you know it's interesting to think about
 

1197
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,350
you know it's interesting to think about
how it all started

1198
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:23,360
how it all started
 

1199
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,390
how it all started
how

1200
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:24,400
how

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,870
how
in the state of injustice

1202
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:26,880
in the state of injustice
 

1203
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,950
in the state of injustice
the

1204
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:28,960
the
 

1205
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,590
the

the revolution percolates
 

1207
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,070
the revolution percolates
like where it starts you said people

1208
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,080
like where it starts you said people
 

1209
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,990
like where it starts you said people
that see something is wrong find each

it's in the ideas of charismatic

1216
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:41,760
it's in the ideas of charismatic
 

1217
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,830
it's in the ideas of charismatic
individuals that not only know that

1218
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:43,840
individuals that not only know that
 

1219
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,190
individuals that not only know that

and then together gather
 

1229
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,909
and then together gather
and rise up it's interesting to make

1230
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:55,919
and rise up it's interesting to make
 

1231
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,470
and rise up it's interesting to make
this kind of incredible progress from

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,710
just one person all it takes is just one
person so here we are

1318
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:36,720

 

1319
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,510

on this topic of equality

1320
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:39,520
on this topic of equality
 

1321
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,950
on this topic of equality
in uh

1322
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:40,960
in uh
 

1323
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,870
in uh
the 21st century

1324
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:42,880
the 21st century
 

1325
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,350
the 21st century
so what does equality mean today

1326
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:45,360
so what does equality mean today
 

1327
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,669
so what does equality mean today
if you start to think

1328
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:47,679
if you start to think
 

1329
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:53,350
if you start to think
about this idea of equality of outcome

1330
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:53,360

 

1331
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,630

or the injustice of inequality

1332
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:56,640
or the injustice of inequality
 

1333
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,149
or the injustice of inequality
at which point does equality of outcome

1334
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:00,159
at which point does equality of outcome
 

1335
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,510
at which point does equality of outcome
is just at which point is it unjust

1336
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:03,520
is just at which point is it unjust
 

1337
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,750
is just at which point is it unjust
sort of looking at our world today and

1338
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:05,760
sort of looking at our world today and
 

1339
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,710
sort of looking at our world today and
looking at in inequality

1340
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:08,720
looking at in inequality
 

1341
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,070
looking at in inequality
how do we know

1342
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,080
how do we know
 

1343
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,870
how do we know
that some inequality is a sign of

1344
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:12,880
that some inequality is a sign of
 

1345
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,390
that some inequality is a sign of
injustice and some is the way of life

1346
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:16,400
injustice and some is the way of life
 

1347
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,390
injustice and some is the way of life
so what does equality mean when we look

1348
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:18,400

1703
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,870
okay i mean let's look at who's actually
writing code let's look at who's

1704
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:46,880
writing code let's look at who's
 

1705

if the difference in culture accounts
for the difference in outcomes

1740
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:26,880
for the difference in outcomes
 

1741
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,070
for the difference in outcomes
or it's the existence of barriers

1742
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:30,080
or it's the existence of barriers
 

1743
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,870
or it's the existence of barriers
especially barriers early on in life

1744
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:32,880
especially barriers early on in life
 

1745

action
 

1751
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,950
action
is

1752
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:40,960

 

1753
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,669

in which ways is affirmative action

1754

how much money does a person make when
they work in the labor market so you

1876
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:53,919
they work in the labor market so you
 

1877
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:55,750
they work in the labor market so you
look at their wages

1878
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:55,760
look at their wages
 

1879
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,750
look at their wages
and you think well that depends upon a

and you think well that depends upon a
 

1881
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,910
and you think well that depends upon a
number of things it depends upon how

that's one
 

1979
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,310
that's one
opportunity issue but that's how that's

so development

2078
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:24,000
so development
 

2079
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,470
so development
is not only something that

2080
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:26,480
is not only something that
 

2081
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,069
is not only something that
is controlled by

is controlled by

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,150
is controlled by
the society's practices it's also

the society's practices it's also
 

2085
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,109
the society's practices it's also
something that is influenced by the the

2086

something that is influenced by the the
 

2087

uh those things vary across

2096
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:42,240
uh those things vary across
 

2097
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,589
uh those things vary across
uh groups in in a very uh significant

2098

uh groups in in a very uh significant
 

2099
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:46,470
uh groups in in a very uh significant
way

way
 

2101
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,150
way
and that too will be a factor

2102
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:50,160
and that too will be a factor
 

2103
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,349
and that too will be a factor
determining disparities of outcome

2104

determining disparities of outcome
 

2105
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:54,870
determining disparities of outcome
so when i see outcomes that are

2106

so when i see outcomes that are
 

2107
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,910
so when i see outcomes that are
different

i see wealth holding
that's different i see educational

in the same way
 

2133
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,630
in the same way
and we know that the answer to that not

2134
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:22,640
and we know that the answer to that not
 

2135
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,390
and we know that the answer to that not
in every instance do they equip people

2136
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:24,400
in every instance do they equip people

00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,230
difficulty of the problem
you think that if you get the right law

2180
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:08,240
you think that if you get the right law
 

2181
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,710
you think that if you get the right law
uh if you have the right public policy

2182
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:10,720
uh if you have the right public policy
 

2183
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,950
uh if you have the right public policy
uh if the right politicians are elected

2184
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:12,960
uh if the right politicians are elected
 

2185
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,710
uh if the right politicians are elected
to office suddenly those disparities

2186
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:14,720
to office suddenly those disparities
 

2187
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,990
to office suddenly those disparities
will go away

2188
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:16,000
will go away
 

2189
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,710
will go away
and um i'm here to tell you that uh that

2190
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:18,720
and um i'm here to tell you that uh that
 

2191
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,190
and um i'm here to tell you that uh that
that's uh a false hope

2192
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:21,200
that's uh a false hope
 

2193
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,150
that's uh a false hope
um

2194
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:22,160
um
 

2195
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,030
um
and and moreover it is probably the

2196
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,040
and and moreover it is probably the
 

2197
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,630
and and moreover it is probably the
wrong goal

2198
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:26,640
wrong goal
 

2199
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,030
wrong goal
uh but i mean we could go into that

2200
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:29,040
uh but i mean we could go into that
 

2201
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,150
uh but i mean we could go into that

prime number okay so
 

2393
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,390
prime number okay so
how do i how would somebody know that

2394
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:02,400
how do i how would somebody know that
 

2395
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,829
how do i how would somebody know that
okay what's a prime number so a prime

2396
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:03,839
okay what's a prime number so a prime
 

2397
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,589
okay what's a prime number so a prime
number is a number that has a whole

2398

number that has no divisor
other than one there are no

2402
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:09,920
other than one there are no
 

2403
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,430
other than one there are no
divisors of the number that makes it a

2404
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:11,440
divisors of the number that makes it a
 

2405
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,349
divisors of the number that makes it a
prime number like 13

2406
00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:13,359
prime number like 13
 

2407
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,790

or 19
or 37 whatever okay

2410
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:17,440
or 37 whatever okay
 

2411
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,430
or 37 whatever okay
so they're prime numbers

2412
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:19,440
so they're prime numbers
 

2413
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,870
so they're prime numbers
there's no largest prime number their

there's no largest prime number i wonder
 

2429
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,349
there's no largest prime number i wonder
if prime numbers show up in economics i

2430
00:44:35,349 --> 00:44:35,359
if prime numbers show up in economics i
 

2431
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:36,870
if prime numbers show up in economics i
mean that oh they don't show up in

2432
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:36,880
mean that oh they don't show up in
 

2433
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,109
mean that oh they don't show up in
economics but except if cryptography i

2434

undergraduate you know the

2510
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:53,280
undergraduate you know the
 

2511
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,349
undergraduate you know the
incompleteness theorem that there are

2512
00:45:55,349 --> 00:45:55,359
incompleteness theorem that there are
 

2513
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,990
incompleteness theorem that there are
propositions within any logical system

propositions within any logical system
 

2515
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,550
propositions within any logical system
that's rich enough to accommodate

2516
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:00,560
that's rich enough to accommodate
 

2517
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,430
that's rich enough to accommodate
uh

2518
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:01,440
uh
 

2519
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,030
uh
accommodate arithmetic they're going to

2520
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:03,040
accommodate arithmetic they're going to
 

2521
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:03,750

00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:05,760
propositions that you can formulate that
 

2525
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,829
propositions that you can formulate that
are true but that you

2526
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:07,839
are true but that you
 

2527
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:09,990
are true but that you
cannot prove to be true

2528
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:10,000
cannot prove to be true
 

2529
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,829
cannot prove to be true
uh so the idea that you could

2530
00:46:12,829 --> 00:46:12,839
uh so the idea that you could
 

2531
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:16,150
uh so the idea that you could
systematically develop a logical

course
 

2577
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,470
course
uh and it was a lot of fun

2578
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:04,480
uh and it was a lot of fun
 

2579
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,589
uh and it was a lot of fun
and it was differentiating

2580
00:47:07,589 --> 00:47:07,599
and it was differentiating
 

2581
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:08,790
and it was differentiating
algebraic

2582
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:08,800

trigonometric substitutions and
 

2587
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,990
trigonometric substitutions and
it was a lot of simple problem solving i

2588
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:16,000
it was a lot of simple problem solving i
 

2589
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,150
it was a lot of simple problem solving i
get to northwestern i take a course in

2590
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:18,160
get to northwestern i take a course in
 

2591
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,829

differential equations
 

2593
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,309
differential equations
and again it was a lot of formulaic you

2594
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:22,319
and again it was a lot of formulaic you
 

2595
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,150
and again it was a lot of formulaic you
know applying if you get a differential

2596
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:24,160
know applying if you get a differential
 

2597
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,750
know applying if you get a differential
equation of this structure like if it's

2598
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:25,760
equation of this structure like if it's
 

2599
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,230
equation of this structure like if it's
linear you've got exponentials etc you

2600
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:28,240
linear you've got exponentials etc you
 

2601
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,750
linear you've got exponentials etc you
can solve it

2602
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:29,760
can solve it
 

2603
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,309
can solve it
and then i took a course that showed me

2604
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:32,319
and then i took a course that showed me
 

2605
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:35,030
and then i took a course that showed me
you know where the question was not how

2606
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:35,040
you know where the question was not how
 

2607
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,349
you know where the question was not how
to solve any particular

and it's basically they called it a
 

2635
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,549

uh
 

2647
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,069
uh
that you can sort of uniformly bound the

2648
00:48:16,069 --> 00:48:16,079
that you can sort of uniformly bound the
 

2649
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:17,670
that you can sort of uniformly bound the
slope on that function and then you can

2650
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:17,680
slope on that function and then you can
 

2651
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,710
slope on that function and then you can
use a

2652
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:18,720
use a
 

2653
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,230
use a
iterative process to uh show that the

and when i saw that those ideas were
 

2715
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,150

00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,309
economics i was delighted i found an
intellectual home

2720
00:49:34,309 --> 00:49:34,319
intellectual home
 

2721
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:35,670
intellectual home
so that

2722
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:35,680
so that
 

2723
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,710
so that
one of the

2724
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:36,720
one of the
 

2725
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,950
one of the
fascinating challenges of mathematics is

2726
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:38,960
fascinating challenges of mathematics is
 

2727
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,549
fascinating challenges of mathematics is
to think

2728
00:49:40,549 --> 00:49:40,559
to think
 

2729
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,230
to think
how can you cons

2730
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:42,240
how can you cons
 

2731
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,829
how can you cons
which echoes the challenge of economics

2732
00:49:45,829 --> 00:49:45,839
which echoes the challenge of economics
 

2733
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,309
which echoes the challenge of economics
what are the properties of an equation

2734
00:49:48,309 --> 00:49:48,319
what are the properties of an equation
 

2735
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,630
what are the properties of an equation
that allow you to

2736
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:50,640
that allow you to
 

2737
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,589
that allow you to
say something profound and say it simply

2738
00:49:53,589 --> 00:49:53,599
say something profound and say it simply
 

2739
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:56,069
say something profound and say it simply
and so the question of economics is how

2740
00:49:56,069 --> 00:49:56,079
and so the question of economics is how
 

2741
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,470
and so the question of economics is how
do you construct a model where you can

2742
00:49:58,470 --> 00:49:58,480
do you construct a model where you can
 

2743
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,870
do you construct a model where you can
generalize nicely and say something

2744
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:00,880
generalize nicely and say something
 

2745
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,109
generalize nicely and say something
profound and say it simply

2746
00:50:03,109 --> 00:50:03,119
profound and say it simply
 

2747
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:04,870
profound and say it simply
uh so one of the

2748
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:04,880
uh so one of the
 

2749
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,390
uh so one of the
questions one of the challenges of

2750
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:06,400
questions one of the challenges of
 

2751
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,670
questions one of the challenges of
economics

2752
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:07,680
economics
 

2753
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,190
economics
is macro versus microeconomics yeah is

2754
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:11,200
is macro versus microeconomics yeah is
 

2755
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,430
is macro versus microeconomics yeah is
um

2756
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:13,440
um
 

2757
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,950
um
you know the world is made up of

2758
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:14,960
you know the world is made up of
 

2759
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,270
you know the world is made up of
individuals so there's a connection to

2760
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:17,280
individuals so there's a connection to
 

2761
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,510
individuals so there's a connection to
this our discussion of

2762
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:19,520
this our discussion of
 

2763
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,829
this our discussion of
of race and discrimination and outcomes

2764
00:50:21,829 --> 00:50:21,839
of race and discrimination and outcomes
 

2765
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:24,069
of race and discrimination and outcomes
and all those kinds of things

2766
00:50:24,069 --> 00:50:24,079
and all those kinds of things
 

2767
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:26,470
and all those kinds of things
the world is made up of individuals

2768
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:26,480
the world is made up of individuals
 

2769
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,549
the world is made up of individuals
but in order to say something

2770
00:50:28,549 --> 00:50:28,559
but in order to say something
 

2771
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:29,670
but in order to say something
general

2772
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:29,680
general
 

2773
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,750
general
we have to construct

2774
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:31,760
we have to construct
 

2775
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,910
we have to construct
groups

2776
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:33,920
groups
 

2777
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,390
groups
in order to analyze the data we have to

2778
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:36,400
in order to analyze the data we have to
 

2779
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,150
in order to analyze the data we have to
aggregate that data somehow we have to

2780
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:38,160
aggregate that data somehow we have to
 

2781
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,430
aggregate that data somehow we have to
make an average over some set of people

2782
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:41,440
make an average over some set of people
 

2783
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,270
make an average over some set of people
so what are the pros and cons of

2784
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:45,280
so what are the pros and cons of
 

2785
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,510
so what are the pros and cons of
looking at things like equality of

2786
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:47,520
looking at things like equality of
 

2787
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,069
looking at things like equality of
opportunity and equality of outcome

2788
00:50:50,069 --> 00:50:50,079
opportunity and equality of outcome
 

2789
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:51,910
opportunity and equality of outcome
based on groups versus based on

2790
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:51,920
based on groups versus based on
 

2791
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,589
based on groups versus based on

uh
 

2797
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,190
uh
what are the groups

2798
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:57,200
what are the groups
 

2799
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,230
what are the groups
if there's any pros to looking at groups

2800
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:00,240
if there's any pros to looking at groups
 

2801
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,390
if there's any pros to looking at groups
that we should be looking at

2802
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:02,400
that we should be looking at
 

2803
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,230
that we should be looking at
okay well those those are big questions

2804
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:04,240
okay well those those are big questions
 

2805
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,309
okay well those those are big questions
i mean in economics

2806
00:51:06,309 --> 00:51:06,319
i mean in economics
 

2807
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:08,630
i mean in economics
you're right i mean micro you have a an

2808
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:08,640
you're right i mean micro you have a an
 

2809
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,710
you're right i mean micro you have a an
account of how individuals make

2810
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:10,720
account of how individuals make
 

2811

decisions about spending their money
 

2813
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,270
decisions about spending their money
on this consumption side and about how

00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,150
on this consumption side and about how
enterprises make decisions about

enterprises make decisions about
 

2817
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,790
enterprises make decisions about
uh what to produce how much of it what

2818
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:20,800
uh what to produce how much of it what
 

2819
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,549
uh what to produce how much of it what
inputs to use what techniques of

and then you want to aggregate so

2826
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:29,200
and then you want to aggregate so
 

2827
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,870
and then you want to aggregate so
there's a theory of so-called theory of

supply and demand in a bunch of markets
you think prices that move to

2836
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:39,520
you think prices that move to
 

2837
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,710
you think prices that move to

00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:29,349
uh
all of the bundles that have the same

00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:29,359
all of the bundles that have the same
 

3009
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:31,109
all of the bundles that have the same

3011
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:33,910
value at a certain price you end up with
inner products you know and and you know

00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:33,920
inner products you know and and you know
 

3013
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,190
inner products you know and and you know
it's just

3014
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:35,200
it's just
 

3015
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,030
it's just
it's very pretty yeah but you almost

3016
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:37,040
it's very pretty yeah but you almost
 

3017
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,829
it's very pretty yeah but you almost
forget that it's just a bunch of humans

3018
00:54:39,829 --> 00:54:39,839
forget that it's just a bunch of humans
 

3019
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:41,670
forget that it's just a bunch of humans

in order to carry out this formalization

3030
00:54:51,349 --> 00:54:51,359
in order to carry out this formalization
 

3031
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:53,109
in order to carry out this formalization
you have to make assumptions

3032
00:54:53,109 --> 00:54:53,119
you have to make assumptions
 

3033
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:55,430
you have to make assumptions
about the individuals and

3034
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:55,440
about the individuals and
 

3035
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,870
about the individuals and
the end result is true in a formal sense

3036
00:54:58,870 --> 00:54:58,880
the end result is true in a formal sense
 

3037
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,589
the end result is true in a formal sense
but may not be true as a representation

3038
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:01,599
but may not be true as a representation
 

3039
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:03,030
but may not be true as a representation
of the reality

3040
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:03,040
of the reality
 

3041
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,030
of the reality
because it depends upon assumptions that

00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:05,040
because it depends upon assumptions that
 

3043
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,750
because it depends upon assumptions that
themselves may not hold

themselves may not hold
 

3045
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,990
themselves may not hold
but at least you know what it is that

3046
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:10,000
but at least you know what it is that
 

3047
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,390

which is already a step in the right

which is already a step in the right
 

3055
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,589
which is already a step in the right
direction i think i mean the

00:55:19,589 --> 00:55:19,599
direction i think i mean the
 

3057
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:21,190

3061
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,309

the aren't your intuition where we sit

00:55:24,309 --> 00:55:24,319
the aren't your intuition where we sit
 

3063
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:26,950
the aren't your intuition where we sit
back and we don't really know

00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:26,960
back and we don't really know
 

3065
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,630
back and we don't really know
exactly what we're talking about because

3066
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:28,640
exactly what we're talking about because
 

3067
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,870
exactly what we're talking about because
we haven't pinned it down

3068
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:30,880
we haven't pinned it down
 

3069
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,910
we haven't pinned it down
um in in a precise way i'm in favor of

3070
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:33,920
um in in a precise way i'm in favor of
 

3071
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,990
um in in a precise way i'm in favor of
the formalization people

3072
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:36,000
the formalization people
 

3073
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,990
the formalization people
they think what is mathematics and the

3074
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:38,000
they think what is mathematics and the
 

3075
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,910
they think what is mathematics and the
social sciences after all we're dealing

00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:39,920
social sciences after all we're dealing
 

3077

with people people are not automata i
 

3079
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,510
with people people are not automata i
agree with that

3080
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:43,520
agree with that
 

3081
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,549
agree with that
but

3082
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:44,559
but

requires us to be specific
 

3089

uh about what we're talking about about

3090
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:54,640
uh about what we're talking about about
 

3091
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,390
uh about what we're talking about about
markets about consumers about firms

00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:56,400
markets about consumers about firms
 

3093

uh about technology about preferences
 

3097
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:05,510
uh about technology about preferences
and uh that's the language of economics

3098
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:05,520
and uh that's the language of economics
 

3099
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:09,109
and uh that's the language of economics
um but people's behavior depends upon

3100
00:56:09,109 --> 00:56:09,119
um but people's behavior depends upon
 

3101
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:10,950
um but people's behavior depends upon
what they seek

3102
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:10,960
what they seek
 

3103
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,349
what they seek
in life what depends upon their goals

3104
00:56:13,349 --> 00:56:13,359
in life what depends upon their goals
 

3105
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:15,030
in life what depends upon their goals
and their objectives

3106
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:15,040
and their objectives
 

3107
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,030
and their objectives
those things are at play

3108
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:17,040
those things are at play
 

3109

the others have died out

3816
01:09:04,709 --> 01:09:04,719
the others have died out
 

3817
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:07,189
the others have died out
and here we are and and you know we can

3818
01:09:07,189 --> 01:09:07,199
and here we are and and you know we can
 

3819
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:09,269
and here we are and and you know we can
just look at the genetic endowments that

3820
01:09:09,269 --> 01:09:09,279
just look at the genetic endowments that
 

3821
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:11,910
just look at the genetic endowments that
characterize our biological

3822
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:11,920
characterize our biological
 

3823
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,390
characterize our biological
essence and we can see that uh

3824
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:14,400
essence and we can see that uh
 

3825
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,829
essence and we can see that uh
we are all quote unquote the same

3826
01:09:15,829 --> 01:09:15,839
we are all quote unquote the same
 

3827
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:17,910
we are all quote unquote the same
beneath the skin and yet

3828
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:17,920
beneath the skin and yet
 

3829
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:18,950
beneath the skin and yet
we end up

3830
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:18,960
we end up
 

3831
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,590
we end up
uh freighting so much weight

3832
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:21,600
uh freighting so much weight
 

3833
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,669
uh freighting so much weight
onto these superficial differences so i

3834
01:09:23,669 --> 01:09:23,679
onto these superficial differences so i
 

3835
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:26,309
onto these superficial differences so i
can i can see both sides of the

3836
01:09:26,309 --> 01:09:26,319
can i can see both sides of the
 

3837
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:28,070
can i can see both sides of the
issue is what i'm saying i can see the

3838
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:28,080
issue is what i'm saying i can see the
 

3839
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:31,269

argument race is an irrelevancy
 

3841
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:32,229

people
 

6545
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:08,870
people
but because of the

6546
01:57:08,870 --> 01:57:08,880
but because of the
 

6547
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:12,390
but because of the
fear that if they were to express it

fear that if they were to express it
they'd be ostracized no one says it and

6550
01:57:15,030 --> 01:57:15,040
they'd be ostracized no one says it and
 

6551
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:17,189
they'd be ostracized no one says it and
since no one is saying it the others who

6552
01:57:17,189 --> 01:57:17,199
since no one is saying it the others who
 

6553
01:57:17,199 --> 01:57:19,189
since no one is saying it the others who
hold the view don't know that they're

6554
01:57:19,189 --> 01:57:19,199
hold the view don't know that they're
 

6555
01:57:19,199 --> 01:57:21,030
hold the view don't know that they're
not alone

6556
01:57:21,030 --> 01:57:21,040
not alone
 

6557
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:22,629
not alone
that they are not the only ones who hold

6558
01:57:22,629 --> 01:57:22,639
that they are not the only ones who hold
 

6559

that they are not the only ones who hold
the view

01:57:24,310 --> 01:57:24,320
the view
 

6561
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:25,910
the view
and hence they keep silent that could be

6562
01:57:25,910 --> 01:57:25,920
and hence they keep silent that could be
 

6563
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:27,830
and hence they keep silent that could be
an equilibrium it could be a

6564
01:57:27,830 --> 01:57:27,840
an equilibrium it could be a
 

6565
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:30,310
an equilibrium it could be a
relatively stable situation in which the

6566
01:57:30,310 --> 01:57:30,320
relatively stable situation in which the
 

6567
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:33,430
relatively stable situation in which the
emperor has no clothes everybody can see

02:13:37,669 --> 02:13:37,679
the problem arises
 

7459
02:13:37,679 --> 02:13:40,310
the problem arises

7465
02:13:46,159 --> 02:13:47,510

that gives

02:14:04,719 --> 02:14:07,030
to be the sort of voices of activism
of a particular idea

of a particular idea
 

7483
02:14:07,040 --> 02:14:09,910
of a particular idea
and not i think activism is beautiful

7484
02:14:09,910 --> 02:14:09,920
and not i think activism is beautiful
 

7485
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:12,069
and not i think activism is beautiful
but not just activism but anybody that

7486
02:14:12,069 --> 02:14:12,079
but not just activism but anybody that
 

7487
02:14:12,079 --> 02:14:14,629
but not just activism but anybody that
disagrees is shut down

7488
02:14:14,629 --> 02:14:14,639
disagrees is shut down
 

7489
02:14:14,639 --> 02:14:18,470
disagrees is shut down
and that that i think the the the blame

7490
02:14:18,470 --> 02:14:18,480
and that that i think the the the blame
 

7491
02:14:18,480 --> 02:14:20,790
and that that i think the the the blame
lies with the administration so i think

7492
02:14:20,790 --> 02:14:20,800
lies with the administration so i think
 

7493
02:14:20,800 --> 02:14:23,510
lies with the administration so i think
the solution is in lessening just like

7494
02:14:23,510 --> 02:14:23,520
the solution is in lessening just like
 

7495
02:14:23,520 --> 02:14:24,870
the solution is in lessening just like
the solution with too big of a

the solution with too big of a

the solution with too big of a
government too big of a bureaucracy is

government too big of a bureaucracy is
 

7499
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:28,790
government too big of a bureaucracy is
there needs to be

it
on a salary that's probably way too low

7524
02:14:53,270 --> 02:14:53,280
on a salary that's probably way too low
 

7525
02:14:53,280 --> 02:14:54,950
on a salary that's probably way too low

7529
02:14:57,119 --> 02:14:59,430
that's the that's the whole point and
then the administration

7530
02:14:59,430 --> 02:14:59,440
then the administration
 

7531
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:01,030
then the administration
just gets in the way

7532
02:15:01,030 --> 02:15:01,040
just gets in the way
 

7533
02:15:01,040 --> 02:15:03,109
just gets in the way
and um

7534
02:15:03,109 --> 02:15:03,119
and um
 

7535
02:15:03,119 --> 02:15:06,069
and um
is the source of this kind of they i

7536
02:15:06,069 --> 02:15:06,079
is the source of this kind of they i
 

7537
02:15:06,079 --> 02:15:07,350
is the source of this kind of they i
would say that

the administration is the barbarians at
 

7543
02:15:11,280 --> 02:15:14,390
the administration is the barbarians at
the gate so um the solution is

7544
02:15:14,390 --> 02:15:14,400
the gate so um the solution is
 

7545
02:15:14,400 --> 02:15:15,669
the gate so um the solution is
smaller bureaucracies smaller

race is the conclusion
that outcome differences by race are in

that outcome differences by race are in
 

7611

the populations people find that to be
 

7615
02:16:29,679 --> 02:16:32,469
the populations people find that to be
completely offensive and unacceptable so

7616
02:16:32,469 --> 02:16:32,479
completely offensive and unacceptable so
 

7617
02:16:32,479 --> 02:16:35,270
completely offensive and unacceptable so
that's what i think is going on

7618
02:16:35,270 --> 02:16:35,280
that's what i think is going on
 

7619
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:37,270
that's what i think is going on
can you still man that case

7620
02:16:37,270 --> 02:16:37,280
can you still man that case
 

7621
02:16:37,280 --> 02:16:39,270
can you still man that case
that we should be careful doing that

7622
02:16:39,270 --> 02:16:39,280
that we should be careful doing that
 

7623
02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:41,750

so
 

7627
02:16:43,679 --> 02:16:46,389
so
this has to do with research

7628
02:16:46,389 --> 02:16:46,399
this has to do with research
 

7629
02:16:46,399 --> 02:16:49,270
this has to do with research
it's like uh the nazis used

what do we mean by cognitive ability so
there's many different kinds of
