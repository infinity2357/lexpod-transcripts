job at taking these findings they had

328
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:32,340
job at taking these findings they had
 

329
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,809
job at taking these findings they had
through you know Decades of research

330
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:34,819
through you know Decades of research

quantifying it and then codifying it

332
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:37,860
quantifying it and then codifying it
 

333
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,909
quantifying it and then codifying it
into a therapy method it's really skills

334
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:40,919
into a therapy method it's really skills
 

335
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:42,890
into a therapy method it's really skills
based I tell couples when they're

based I tell couples when they're
 

337
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,969
based I tell couples when they're
starting out with me that they're

338
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:43,979
starting out with me that they're
 

339
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:46,129
starting out with me that they're
essentially going to be starting a class

340
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:46,139
essentially going to be starting a class
 

341
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,469
essentially going to be starting a class
so what's the five to one Golden Rule

342
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
so what's the five to one Golden Rule
 

343
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,809
so what's the five to one Golden Rule
what I read is there's the kind of

344
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:50,819
what I read is there's the kind of
 

345
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:53,629
what I read is there's the kind of
balance you can achieve of

346
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:53,639
balance you can achieve of
 

347
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:56,390
balance you can achieve of
uh how many interactions you have in a

348
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,400
uh how many interactions you have in a
 

349
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,710
uh how many interactions you have in a
relationships that are positive versus

350
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:57,720
relationships that are positive versus
 

351
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,990
relationships that are positive versus
negative and I think that's what the

352
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
negative and I think that's what the
 

353
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,270
negative and I think that's what the
five to one means but basically there

354
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:02,280
five to one means but basically there
 

355
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,210
five to one means but basically there
should be a kind of an empirical

356
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:05,220
should be a kind of an empirical
 

357
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,790
should be a kind of an empirical
like if you just look back over over a

358
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:07,800
like if you just look back over over a
 

359
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,230
like if you just look back over over a
month how many of the interactions were

360
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:09,240
month how many of the interactions were
 

361
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,230
month how many of the interactions were
positive for the day or the day

362
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,240
positive for the day or the day
 

363
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,189
positive for the day or the day
right so the the idea of this ratio

364
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:16,199
right so the the idea of this ratio
 

365
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,809
right so the the idea of this ratio
um well it's not an idea it was a

366
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:17,819
um well it's not an idea it was a
 

367

you also that makes you vulnerable
vulnerable and I actually thought that

00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:14,100
vulnerable and I actually thought that
 

517
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,490
vulnerable and I actually thought that
after I sent it but I feel that most of

518
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:16,500
after I sent it but I feel that most of
 

519
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,850
after I sent it but I feel that most of
the day any interaction like oh God I

520
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:19,860
the day any interaction like oh God I
 

521
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,889
the day any interaction like oh God I
just expose myself but absolutely I was

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,329
to think that I didn't care
I think being a therapist has shown me

528
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:29,339
I think being a therapist has shown me
 

529
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:33,110
I think being a therapist has shown me
that it really it's so lucky to be in

530
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,120
that it really it's so lucky to be in
 

531
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,850
that it really it's so lucky to be in
that position because you meet people

532
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:34,860
that position because you meet people
 

533
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,009
that position because you meet people
that you would have thought are cooler

534
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:37,019
that you would have thought are cooler
 

535
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,829
that you would have thought are cooler
than you or smarter than you or just

than you or smarter than you or just
 

537
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,350
than you or smarter than you or just
somehow impervious to life and you

538
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:42,360
somehow impervious to life and you
 

539
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,850
somehow impervious to life and you
realize that we are all in it together

540
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:43,860
realize that we are all in it together
 

541
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,269
realize that we are all in it together
we all want to be cared about and liked

545
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,710
we all would want to be liked as a
baseline I some people will say they

546
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:51,720
baseline I some people will say they
 

547
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,550
baseline I some people will say they
don't care but everybody does it's human

548
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:54,560
don't care but everybody does it's human

and I have gotten much better being a
 

551
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,269
and I have gotten much better being a
therapist much more comfortable showing

552
00:10:59,269 --> 00:10:59,279
therapist much more comfortable showing
 

553
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,269
therapist much more comfortable showing
caring showing love and genuineness and

caring showing love and genuineness and
 

555
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,889
caring showing love and genuineness and
vulnerability than I think I ever would

556
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:03,899
vulnerability than I think I ever would
 

557
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:05,449
vulnerability than I think I ever would
have been otherwise and that kind of

558
00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:05,459
have been otherwise and that kind of
 

559
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:07,730
have been otherwise and that kind of
vulnerability is what's required to do a

560
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:07,740
vulnerability is what's required to do a
 

561
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,949
vulnerability is what's required to do a
positive interaction in a relationship I

differently everybody handles emotional
expression differently I mean I have

634
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:25,079
expression differently I mean I have
 

635
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:27,230
expression differently I mean I have
couples where I have one person in the

636
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:27,240
couples where I have one person in the
 

637
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,630
couples where I have one person in the
partnership who has autism and the other

638
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:29,640
partnership who has autism and the other
 

639
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,329
partnership who has autism and the other
doesn't and so they're obviously going

640
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:32,339
doesn't and so they're obviously going
 

641
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:34,130
doesn't and so they're obviously going
to have different ways of communicating

642
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:34,140
to have different ways of communicating
 

643
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,650
to have different ways of communicating
or processing what happened we all have

644
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:36,660
or processing what happened we all have
 

645
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,350
or processing what happened we all have
different perspectives it really depends

646
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,360
different perspectives it really depends
 

647
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,050
different perspectives it really depends
on what makes a person feel like it's

648
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:42,060
on what makes a person feel like it's
 

649
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,150
on what makes a person feel like it's
been repaired what makes a person feel

understood does that need to be verbal

652
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:46,380
understood does that need to be verbal
 

653
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,530
understood does that need to be verbal
or in the case of that older couple I

654
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:48,540
or in the case of that older couple I
 

655
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,990
or in the case of that older couple I
have where they know they understand one

toward one another after

what are some common ways relationships

662
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:56,880
what are some common ways relationships
 

663
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,730
what are some common ways relationships
fail that you've observed and all the

664
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:58,740
fail that you've observed and all the

identified what they call the Four

668
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,000
identified what they call the Four
 

669
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,850

Horsemen of the Apocalypse so okay

670
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:06,860
Horsemen of the Apocalypse so okay
 

671
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,350
Horsemen of the Apocalypse so okay
I mean I could just keep it simple and

672
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:09,360
I mean I could just keep it simple and
 

673
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,230
I mean I could just keep it simple and
go off their research so they're those

674
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,240
go off their research so they're those
 

675
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,810
go off their research so they're those
are four different behaviors that they

676
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:14,820
are four different behaviors that they
 

677
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,030
are four different behaviors that they
identify in couples or that you can

678
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,040
identify in couples or that you can
 

679
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,889
identify in couples or that you can
identify in couples that are really

680
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:18,899
identify in couples that are really
 

681
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,690
identify in couples that are really
highly predictive of a divorce some more

682
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:20,700
highly predictive of a divorce some more
 

683
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,430
highly predictive of a divorce some more
than others but I'll start with the

684
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:22,440
than others but I'll start with the
 

685
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,569
than others but I'll start with the
lower ones

686
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:23,579
lower ones
 

687
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:26,690
lower ones
so one thing that we by the way actually

688
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:26,700
so one thing that we by the way actually
 

689
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,290
so one thing that we by the way actually
we all do these things these would be in

690
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:30,300
we all do these things these would be in
 

691
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,269
we all do these things these would be in
that five to one ratio you'd want to

692
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:32,279
that five to one ratio you'd want to
 

693
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,949
that five to one ratio you'd want to
stay away from some of these these are

694
00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:33,959
stay away from some of these these are
 

695
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:36,650
stay away from some of these these are
the ones so as they pile up now that

696
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:36,660
the ones so as they pile up now that
 

697
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,329
the ones so as they pile up now that
ratio is going to get imbalanced and

698
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:38,339
ratio is going to get imbalanced and
 

699
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:41,269
ratio is going to get imbalanced and
then you are headed for a split okay so

700
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:41,279
then you are headed for a split okay so
 

701
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,009
then you are headed for a split okay so
the first is criticism

702
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:43,019
the first is criticism
 

703
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:45,590
the first is criticism
so criticism is when we have a complaint

704
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:45,600
so criticism is when we have a complaint
 

705
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,110
so criticism is when we have a complaint
complaints are normal but instead of

706
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:48,120
complaints are normal but instead of
 

707
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,870
complaints are normal but instead of
owning our own problems our own feelings

708
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:50,880
owning our own problems our own feelings
 

709
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,269
owning our own problems our own feelings
we assume that our perspective is com

710
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:53,279
we assume that our perspective is com
 

711
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,569
we assume that our perspective is com
the only valid accurate perspective and

712
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:56,579
the only valid accurate perspective and
 

713
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:59,329
the only valid accurate perspective and
so we uh take it upon ourselves to tell

714
00:13:59,329 --> 00:13:59,339
so we uh take it upon ourselves to tell
 

715
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,670
so we uh take it upon ourselves to tell
our partner what is wrong with them okay

716
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:01,680
our partner what is wrong with them okay
 

717
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,150
our partner what is wrong with them okay
so there there's essentially no real

718
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:05,160
so there there's essentially no real
 

719
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,129
so there there's essentially no real
belief that they might have a valid

720
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:07,139
belief that they might have a valid
 

721
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,170
belief that they might have a valid
perspective too so

722
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:09,180
perspective too so
 

723
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,350
perspective too so
this could look like you never helped me

724
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:12,360
this could look like you never helped me
 

725
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,230
this could look like you never helped me
out in that with the house or even

726
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:15,240
out in that with the house or even
 

727
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,690
out in that with the house or even
um you're so lazy like can't I just get

728
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:17,700
um you're so lazy like can't I just get
 

729
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,250
um you're so lazy like can't I just get
you for five seconds to help with the

730
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:19,260
you for five seconds to help with the
 

731
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,530
you for five seconds to help with the
kids or something like that

732
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:21,540
kids or something like that
 

733
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,990
kids or something like that
um and then what happens is Horsemen

734
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,000
um and then what happens is Horsemen
 

735
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,110
um and then what happens is Horsemen
number two defensiveness so uh not

736
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:27,120
number two defensiveness so uh not
 

737
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,210
number two defensiveness so uh not
everybody is defensive just because they

738
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:29,220
everybody is defensive just because they
 

739
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,949
everybody is defensive just because they
were criticized some people just are

740
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:30,959
were criticized some people just are
 

741
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,690
were criticized some people just are
more prone to defensiveness than others

742
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:32,700
more prone to defensiveness than others
 

743
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,569
more prone to defensiveness than others
none of us really like admitting our

744
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:35,579
none of us really like admitting our
 

745
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:37,790
none of us really like admitting our
faults so it's pretty natural

746
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:37,800
faults so it's pretty natural
 

747
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,710
faults so it's pretty natural
but defensiveness is essentially making

748
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:39,720
but defensiveness is essentially making
 

749
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,230
but defensiveness is essentially making
excuses or Worse turning it around on

750
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,240
excuses or Worse turning it around on
 

751
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,269
excuses or Worse turning it around on
your partner

752
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:43,279
your partner
 

753
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,250
your partner
not accepting any responsibility and

754
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:46,260
not accepting any responsibility and
 

755
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,170
not accepting any responsibility and
definitely not validating what they're

756
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:48,180
definitely not validating what they're
 

757
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,490
definitely not validating what they're
feeling

758
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:49,500
feeling
 

759
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,430
feeling
now if you get criticized enough or if

760
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:52,440
now if you get criticized enough or if
 

761
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,710
now if you get criticized enough or if
you get really flooded that flooding is

762
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:54,720
you get really flooded that flooding is
 

763
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,389
you get really flooded that flooding is
what happens when our heart rate goes up

764
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:56,399
what happens when our heart rate goes up
 

765
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,730
what happens when our heart rate goes up
kind of around 100 beats per minute our

766
00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:58,740
kind of around 100 beats per minute our
 

767
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,829
kind of around 100 beats per minute our
frontal lobe shuts down that's our

768
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:00,839
frontal lobe shuts down that's our
 

769
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:03,590
frontal lobe shuts down that's our
thoughtful brain our logical brain and

770
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:03,600
thoughtful brain our logical brain and
 

771
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,509
thoughtful brain our logical brain and
our reptilian kind of hindbrain takes

772
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:05,519
our reptilian kind of hindbrain takes
 

773
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,069
our reptilian kind of hindbrain takes
over our thinking

774
00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:07,079
over our thinking
 

775
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,170
over our thinking
and we just go into fight or flight in a

776
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:09,180
and we just go into fight or flight in a
 

777
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,970
and we just go into fight or flight in a
white week we just want to annihilate

778
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:10,980
white week we just want to annihilate
 

779
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,250
white week we just want to annihilate
our partner instead instead of say

780
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:13,260
our partner instead instead of say
 

781
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,569
our partner instead instead of say
anything that would be helpful to the

782
00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:14,579
anything that would be helpful to the
 

783
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:15,590
anything that would be helpful to the
relationship

784
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:15,600
relationship

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,710
relationship
so if you're getting flooded you could

786
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:18,720
so if you're getting flooded you could
 

787
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,210
so if you're getting flooded you could
do a couple things you could get super

788
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:20,220
do a couple things you could get super
 

789
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,829
do a couple things you could get super
critical you could get contemptuous

790
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:21,839
critical you could get contemptuous
 

791
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,509
critical you could get contemptuous
which I'll talk about in a second it's

792
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:23,519
which I'll talk about in a second it's
 

793
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,430
which I'll talk about in a second it's

is it's hard to do that because I think
 

1311
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,029
is it's hard to do that because I think
that you'll probably be offended at

1312
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:17,039
that you'll probably be offended at

gottman research showed us taught us

1472
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:13,380
gottman research showed us taught us
 

1473
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:16,250
gottman research showed us taught us
provided us is that we can do these

1474
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:16,260
provided us is that we can do these
 

1475
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,769
provided us is that we can do these
things that become cyclic and just keep

1476
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:18,779
things that become cyclic and just keep
 

1477
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:20,510
things that become cyclic and just keep
growing this relationship making it

1478
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:20,520
growing this relationship making it

00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:24,900
would never want to cut it down well we
 

1483
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,750
would never want to cut it down well we
you were talking about the sheet for

1484
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:26,760
you were talking about the sheet for
 

1485
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,090
you were talking about the sheet for
conflict processing what are we talking

1486
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:29,100
conflict processing what are we talking
 

1487
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,370
conflict processing what are we talking
about so like a couple will come and say

1488
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:31,380
about so like a couple will come and say
 

1489
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,169
about so like a couple will come and say
like there was this conflict and you put

1490
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:33,179
like there was this conflict and you put
 

1491
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:34,850
like there was this conflict and you put
on the table and then what does it mean

1492
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:34,860
on the table and then what does it mean
 

1493
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,310
on the table and then what does it mean
to process it so in that gottman method

1494
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:37,320
to process it so in that gottman method
 

1495
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,110
to process it so in that gottman method
of therapy there are all these different

1496
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:39,120
of therapy there are all these different
 

1497
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,250
of therapy there are all these different
I mean hundreds of different

1498
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:40,260
I mean hundreds of different
 

1499
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,890
I mean hundreds of different
interventions and based on what the

1500
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:42,900
interventions and based on what the
 

1501
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,350
interventions and based on what the
issue is in that session you can decide

1502
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:45,360
issue is in that session you can decide
 

1503
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,990
issue is in that session you can decide
the most appropriate intervention and so

1504
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:48,000
the most appropriate intervention and so
 

1505
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,390
the most appropriate intervention and so
this is a specific intervention for if

1506
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:50,400
this is a specific intervention for if
 

1507
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,269
this is a specific intervention for if
it is a conflict that occurred and there

1508
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:53,279
it is a conflict that occurred and there
 

1509
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,649
it is a conflict that occurred and there
are different types of conflicts so this

1510
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:54,659
are different types of conflicts so this
 

1511
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:57,289
are different types of conflicts so this
would be more like an incident it's not

1512
00:28:57,289 --> 00:28:57,299
would be more like an incident it's not
 

1513
00:28:57,299 --> 00:28:59,810
would be more like an incident it's not
a Perpetual recurring problem

1514
00:28:59,810 --> 00:28:59,820
a Perpetual recurring problem
 

1515
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,130
a Perpetual recurring problem
um which has actually a different

1516
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:01,140
um which has actually a different
 

1517
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,049
um which has actually a different
intervention where you kind of look at

1518
00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:03,059
intervention where you kind of look at
 

1519
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:06,470
intervention where you kind of look at
the underlying belief systems values and

1520
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:06,480
the underlying belief systems values and
 

1521
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,049
the underlying belief systems values and
there's the goal is not to solve that

1522
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:09,059
there's the goal is not to solve that
 

1523
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:11,450
there's the goal is not to solve that
problem the goal in that situation is to

1524
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:11,460
problem the goal in that situation is to
 

1525
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,950
problem the goal in that situation is to
actually just get a better understanding

1526
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:12,960
actually just get a better understanding
 

1527
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,230
actually just get a better understanding
of each other and your positions and

1528
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:15,240
of each other and your positions and
 

1529
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,350
of each other and your positions and
just you stop seeing your partner as the

00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:18,360
just you stop seeing your partner as the
 

1531
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,269
just you stop seeing your partner as the
adverse area and you start seeing them

00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:20,279
adverse area and you start seeing them
 

1533
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,630
adverse area and you start seeing them
as a person who makes sense

1534
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:22,640
as a person who makes sense
 

1535

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,690
and then vice versa
and then there's this um Step where each

1580

resiliency easy going yeah Okay the
third is

1934
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:02,400
third is
 

1935
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,510
third is
um really interesting I think so he

1936
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:05,520
um really interesting I think so he
 

1937
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,250
um really interesting I think so he
found that

1938
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:07,260
found that
 

1939
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,470

having a partner with sort of moderate

1940
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:09,480
having a partner with sort of moderate
 

1941
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,349
having a partner with sort of moderate
adventurousness not high adventurousness

1942
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:12,359
adventurousness not high adventurousness
 

1943
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:14,750
adventurousness not high adventurousness
actually leads to greater greater

1944
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:14,760
actually leads to greater greater
 

1945
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,490
actually leads to greater greater
satisfaction and the reason for that is

1946
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:16,500
satisfaction and the reason for that is
 

1947
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,250
satisfaction and the reason for that is
high adventurousness equals novelty

1948
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:19,260
high adventurousness equals novelty
 

1949
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:23,510
high adventurousness equals novelty
seeking shiny new things and so if

1950
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:23,520
seeking shiny new things and so if
 

1951
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,250
seeking shiny new things and so if
you're in a monogamous relationship if

1952
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:25,260
you're in a monogamous relationship if
 

1953
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,650
you're in a monogamous relationship if
that is what's important to you it's

1954
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:27,660
that is what's important to you it's
 

1955
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,170
that is what's important to you it's
going to be very hard for a partner who

1956
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:30,180
going to be very hard for a partner who
 

1957
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,170
going to be very hard for a partner who
is novelty seeking to be faithful

1958
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:33,180
is novelty seeking to be faithful
 

1959
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,270
is novelty seeking to be faithful
um so that will cause a lot of pain but

1960
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:35,280
um so that will cause a lot of pain but
 

1961
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,349
um so that will cause a lot of pain but
also

1962
00:37:36,349 --> 00:37:36,359
also
 

1963
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:39,410
also
um novelty seeking people tend to always

1964
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:39,420
um novelty seeking people tend to always
 

1965
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,510
um novelty seeking people tend to always
have new projects new interesting things

1966
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:41,520
have new projects new interesting things
 

1967
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,609
have new projects new interesting things
and so their attention is drawn away

1968
00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:43,619
and so their attention is drawn away
 

1969
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:46,970
and so their attention is drawn away
from the relationship and so you can

1970
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:46,980
from the relationship and so you can
 

1971
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,170
from the relationship and so you can
just feel pretty neglected or

1972
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:48,180
just feel pretty neglected or
 

1973
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,550
just feel pretty neglected or
unimportant

1974
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:49,560
unimportant
 

1975
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,890
unimportant
by a little bit but you want a little

1976
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:51,900
by a little bit but you want a little
 

1977
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,390
by a little bit but you want a little
bit of adventurousness so you want your

1978
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:53,400
bit of adventurousness so you want your
 

1979
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,089
bit of adventurousness so you want your
person to be uh sort of self-motivated

1980
00:37:56,089 --> 00:37:56,099

uh individuated have their own interests

1982
00:37:58,730 --> 00:37:58,740
uh individuated have their own interests
 

1983
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,829
uh individuated have their own interests
not completely dependent on you but also

1984
00:38:00,829 --> 00:38:00,839
not completely dependent on you but also
 

1985
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:02,750
not completely dependent on you but also
I mean low adventurousness is not a bad

pretty incredible

2156
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:09,240
pretty incredible
 

2157
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,609
pretty incredible
um

2158
00:41:10,609 --> 00:41:10,619
um
 

2159
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:13,550

00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:20,940
going to have a lower stress level
 

2169
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,370
going to have a lower stress level
you're going to feel immediately close

2170
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:22,380
you're going to feel immediately close
 

2171
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,630
you're going to feel immediately close
to your partner you're going to get a

2172
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:23,640
to your partner you're going to get a
 

2173
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,089
to your partner you're going to get a
rush of oxytocin which is going to make

2174
00:41:26,089 --> 00:41:26,099
rush of oxytocin which is going to make
 

2175
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:28,310
rush of oxytocin which is going to make
you feel happier more grounded

2176
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:28,320
you feel happier more grounded
 

2177
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,770
you feel happier more grounded
throughout the day so that's a 20 second

2178
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:30,780
throughout the day so that's a 20 second
 

2179
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,530
throughout the day so that's a 20 second
hug you extrapolate that to sex and

2180
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:33,540
hug you extrapolate that to sex and
 

2181
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,910
hug you extrapolate that to sex and
things are going to be great

2182
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:34,920
things are going to be great
 

2183
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,430
things are going to be great
so it's just physiological but I wonder

2184
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:37,440
so it's just physiological but I wonder
 

2185
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,349
so it's just physiological but I wonder
there's probably metrics about how often

2186
00:41:39,349 --> 00:41:39,359
there's probably metrics about how often
 

2187
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,510
there's probably metrics about how often
you have sex how that correlates to

2188
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:41,520
you have sex how that correlates to
 

2189
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,490
you have sex how that correlates to
successful relationships and so on well

2190
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:43,500
successful relationships and so on well
 

2191
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,650
successful relationships and so on well
there are but it really has more to do

2192
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:45,660
there are but it really has more to do
 

2193
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,270
there are but it really has more to do
it's sort of like remember I was talking

2194
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:47,280
it's sort of like remember I was talking
 

2195
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,190
it's sort of like remember I was talking
about processing conflict and what

2196
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:49,200
about processing conflict and what
 

2197
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,750
about processing conflict and what
matters is

2198
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:50,760
matters is
 

2199
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,210
matters is
do people feel like it's been resolved

2200
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:53,220
do people feel like it's been resolved
 

2201
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,530
do people feel like it's been resolved
do they feel like there's been a repair

2202
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:54,540
do they feel like there's been a repair
 

2203
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,569
do they feel like there's been a repair
not necessarily how they go about doing

2204
00:41:56,569 --> 00:41:56,579

because I I totally agree but it's it's
like logically

2532
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:25,020
like logically
 

2533
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:28,430
like logically
it's doesn't quite make sense to give

2534
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:28,440
it's doesn't quite make sense to give
 

2535

it's doesn't quite make sense to give
that advice but psychologically makes

2536
00:48:30,589 --> 00:48:30,599
that advice but psychologically makes
 

2537
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:32,569
that advice but psychologically makes
complete sense because you really are

2538
00:48:32,569 --> 00:48:32,579
complete sense because you really are
 

2539
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:34,970
complete sense because you really are
destroying another person's mind uh

2540
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:34,980
destroying another person's mind uh
 

2541

their their their trust everything and
 

2545
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,069
their their their trust everything and
then you're imprisoning them to be stuck

2546
00:48:43,069 --> 00:48:43,079
then you're imprisoning them to be stuck
 

2547
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:45,290
then you're imprisoning them to be stuck
with you for months or years if you're

2548
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:45,300
with you for months or years if you're
 

2549

trying to work through it through that
 

2551
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,069
trying to work through it through that
torture so you should be carrying that

2552
00:48:49,069 --> 00:48:49,079
torture so you should be carrying that
 

2553
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:50,390
torture so you should be carrying that
burden and working through it I think

2554
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:50,400
burden and working through it I think
 

2555
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,609
burden and working through it I think
why why do you say that that's your

2556

why why do you say that that's your
 

2557
00:48:52,619 --> 00:48:53,809
why why do you say that that's your
personal opinion University or

00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,109
everybody has different values right so
I think that's a value-based decision

2564
00:49:00,109 --> 00:49:00,119
I think that's a value-based decision
 

2565
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:02,930
I think that's a value-based decision
because to me the hierarchy is kindness

2566
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:02,940
because to me the hierarchy is kindness
 

2567

2570
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:10,560
um over that's in that case over truth
 

2571
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,050
um over that's in that case over truth
right

2572
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:12,060
right
 

2573
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:15,349
right
um whereas other people you know my

2574
00:49:15,349 --> 00:49:15,359
um whereas other people you know my
 

2575
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,150
um whereas other people you know my
husband for instance he is like truth

above all else you don't get to decide

2578
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:19,640
above all else you don't get to decide
 

2579
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,309
above all else you don't get to decide
what I know or you know you don't get to

2580
00:49:22,309 --> 00:49:22,319
what I know or you know you don't get to
 

2581

decide whether or not I can handle that

2582
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:23,880
decide whether or not I can handle that
 

2583
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,270
decide whether or not I can handle that
knowledge so he would even see my

2584
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:26,280
knowledge so he would even see my
 

2585
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,030
knowledge so he would even see my
determination of you know that I should

2586
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:29,040
determination of you know that I should
 

2587
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,010
determination of you know that I should
carry the burden sort of arrogant like

00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:31,020
carry the burden sort of arrogant like
 

2589
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:32,750
carry the burden sort of arrogant like

well why don't you let your partner
 

2591
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,089
well why don't you let your partner
decide whether or not they you know why

2592
00:49:35,089 --> 00:49:35,099
decide whether or not they you know why
 

2593
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:37,010
decide whether or not they you know why
do you get to choose I don't know I I

2594
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:37,020
do you get to choose I don't know I I
 

2595
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:39,109
do you get to choose I don't know I I
think there's value to both arguments I

2596
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:39,119
think there's value to both arguments I
 

2597
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,630
think there's value to both arguments I
absolutely see this point is I

2598
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:41,640
absolutely see this point is I
 

2599
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,790
absolutely see this point is I
absolutely see his point and his I think

2600
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:43,800
absolutely see his point and his I think
 

2601
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,710
absolutely see his point and his I think
is like a very humble sort of option

2602
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:45,720
is like a very humble sort of option
 

2603
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,730
is like a very humble sort of option
like

2604
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:46,740
like
 

2605
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:49,010
like
you don't get to choose what's better

2606
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:49,020
you don't get to choose what's better
 

2607
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,690
you don't get to choose what's better
you you just need to give them the

2608
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:50,700
you you just need to give them the
 

2609
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,690
you you just need to give them the
information and they can choose but I

2610
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:53,700
information and they can choose but I
 

2611
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,609
information and they can choose but I
think I don't know I think it's kinder

2612
00:49:55,609 --> 00:49:55,619
think I don't know I think it's kinder
 

2613
00:49:55,619 --> 00:49:57,890
think I don't know I think it's kinder
to hold I think it's going to cause your

2614
00:49:57,890 --> 00:49:57,900
to hold I think it's going to cause your
 

2615
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,109
to hold I think it's going to cause your
conscience more discomfort to hold it

2616
00:50:00,109 --> 00:50:00,119
conscience more discomfort to hold it
 

2617
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:02,390
conscience more discomfort to hold it
and I think there's sort of a cleansing

2618
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:02,400
and I think there's sort of a cleansing
 

2619
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,370
and I think there's sort of a cleansing
we do when we share that information I

2620
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:04,380
we do when we share that information I
 

2621
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,589
we do when we share that information I
think in real life most people disclose

2622
00:50:06,589 --> 00:50:06,599
think in real life most people disclose
 

2623
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:08,510
think in real life most people disclose
it because they can't stand the secret

2624
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:08,520
it because they can't stand the secret
 

2625
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,089
it because they can't stand the secret
anymore themselves that to me is a

2626
00:50:11,089 --> 00:50:11,099
anymore themselves that to me is a
 

2627
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:13,370
anymore themselves that to me is a
selfish act I have a unemployment

2628
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:13,380
selfish act I have a unemployment
 

2629
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,530
selfish act I have a unemployment
applications and so on and just with

2630
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:15,540
applications and so on and just with
 

2631
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:18,410
applications and so on and just with
friends would ask people what do you

2632
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:18,420
friends would ask people what do you
 

2633
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:21,109
friends would ask people what do you
care more about truth or loyalty just to

2634
00:50:21,109 --> 00:50:21,119
care more about truth or loyalty just to
 

2635
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:23,150
care more about truth or loyalty just to
get to see how they think about those

2636
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:23,160
get to see how they think about those
 

2637
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,710
get to see how they think about those
different questions

2638
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:24,720
different questions
 

2639
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,290
different questions
and uh yeah the

2640
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:27,300
and uh yeah the
 

2641
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,990
and uh yeah the
I was surprised how much variance there

2642
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:30,000
I was surprised how much variance there
 

2643
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,230
I was surprised how much variance there
is on that and also conceptually I bet

2644
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:33,240
is on that and also conceptually I bet
 

2645
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,270
is on that and also conceptually I bet
I conceptually I don't think we actually

2646
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:35,280
I conceptually I don't think we actually
 

2647
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,550
I conceptually I don't think we actually
know where we stand until we're faced

2648
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:37,560
know where we stand until we're faced
 

2649
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,050
know where we stand until we're faced
with a situation like that yeah I think

2650
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:39,060
with a situation like that yeah I think
 

2651
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,809
with a situation like that yeah I think
people a lot of people especially when

2652
00:50:41,809 --> 00:50:41,819
people a lot of people especially when
 

2653
00:50:41,819 --> 00:50:43,849
people a lot of people especially when
they're younger say especially if

2654
00:50:43,849 --> 00:50:43,859
they're younger say especially if
 

2655
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:45,890
they're younger say especially if
they're kind of intellectual they'll say

2656
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:45,900
they're kind of intellectual they'll say
 

2657
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,290
they're kind of intellectual they'll say
truth Above All Else

2658
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:48,300
truth Above All Else
 

2659
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,910
truth Above All Else
a second all right you're exactly right

2660
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:49,920
a second all right you're exactly right
 

2661
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,770
a second all right you're exactly right
all right

2662
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:53,780

 

2663
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:56,569

until you get to hear a truth that truly

2664
00:50:56,569 --> 00:50:56,579
until you get to hear a truth that truly
 

2665
00:50:56,579 --> 00:50:58,910
until you get to hear a truth that truly
breaks you truly hurts you or causes

2666
00:50:58,910 --> 00:50:58,920
breaks you truly hurts you or causes
 

2667
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,730
breaks you truly hurts you or causes
suffering to you and then you realize or

2668
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:01,740
suffering to you and then you realize or
 

2669
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:03,470
suffering to you and then you realize or
a truth you give to somebody else will

2670
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:03,480
a truth you give to somebody else will
 

2671
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,569
a truth you give to somebody else will

think that may have been actually what

2730
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:03,240
think that may have been actually what
 

2731
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,510
think that may have been actually what
was behind my question about

2732
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:05,520
was behind my question about
 

2733
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,790
was behind my question about
um the satisfaction with them being on

2734
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:07,800
um the satisfaction with them being on
 

2735
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,770
um the satisfaction with them being on
the extremes my hypothesis essentially

2736
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:09,780
the extremes my hypothesis essentially
 

2737
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:12,589
the extremes my hypothesis essentially
was is it because they if you are really

2738
00:52:12,589 --> 00:52:12,599
was is it because they if you are really
 

2739
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:14,809
was is it because they if you are really
all and you've worked out some of the

2740
00:52:14,809 --> 00:52:14,819
all and you've worked out some of the
 

2741
00:52:14,819 --> 00:52:17,510
all and you've worked out some of the
Kinks I think I've seen

2742
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:17,520
Kinks I think I've seen
 

2743
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,530
Kinks I think I've seen
um

2744
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:18,540
um
 

2745
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:21,470
um
the couples who are trying it out like

2746
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:21,480
the couples who are trying it out like
 

2747
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,569
the couples who are trying it out like
for the first time it tends to get a

2748
00:52:23,569 --> 00:52:23,579
for the first time it tends to get a
 

2749
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:25,609
for the first time it tends to get a
little Haywire there's some excitement

2750
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:25,619
little Haywire there's some excitement
 

2751
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:27,230
little Haywire there's some excitement
in the beginning everybody's really

2752
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:27,240
in the beginning everybody's really
 

2753
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:28,910
in the beginning everybody's really
excited about it

2754
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:28,920
excited about it
 

2755
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,829
excited about it
um I think the philosophy makes sense to

2756
00:52:30,829 --> 00:52:30,839
um I think the philosophy makes sense to
 

2757
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,710
um I think the philosophy makes sense to
a lot of people uh the science of it

2758
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:33,720
a lot of people uh the science of it
 

2759
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:36,410
a lot of people uh the science of it
makes sense to a lot of people and but

2760
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:36,420
makes sense to a lot of people and but
 

2761
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,690
makes sense to a lot of people and but
we have been raised in a society that is

2762
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:38,700
we have been raised in a society that is
 

2763
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,569
we have been raised in a society that is
pretty monogamous so there isn't a lot

2764
00:52:41,569 --> 00:52:41,579
pretty monogamous so there isn't a lot
 

2765
00:52:41,579 --> 00:52:43,250
pretty monogamous so there isn't a lot
of scaffolding around it

2766
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:43,260
of scaffolding around it
 

2767
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,230
of scaffolding around it
um and and there's a lot of inner

2768
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:45,240
um and and there's a lot of inner
 

2769
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,670
um and and there's a lot of inner
conflict I think for people to go away

2770
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:46,680
conflict I think for people to go away
 

2771
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,049
conflict I think for people to go away
from the values that they've been taught

2772
00:52:48,049 --> 00:52:48,059
from the values that they've been taught
 

2773
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:49,970
from the values that they've been taught
since they were kids

2774
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:49,980
since they were kids
 

2775
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:53,210
since they were kids
um and so jealousy arises a lot and uh

2776
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:53,220
um and so jealousy arises a lot and uh
 

2777
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:56,809
um and so jealousy arises a lot and uh
and also I it's very difficult to be I

2778
00:52:56,809 --> 00:52:56,819
and also I it's very difficult to be I
 

2779
00:52:56,819 --> 00:52:58,609
and also I it's very difficult to be I
think as truthful and direct as you need

2780
00:52:58,609 --> 00:52:58,619
think as truthful and direct as you need
 

2781
00:52:58,619 --> 00:53:01,010
think as truthful and direct as you need
to be which you're describing in these

2782
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:01,020
to be which you're describing in these
 

2783
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:03,230
to be which you're describing in these
polyamorous situations where everybody

2784
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:03,240
polyamorous situations where everybody
 

2785
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,990
polyamorous situations where everybody
is laid out on the table

2786
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:06,000
is laid out on the table
 

2787
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,430
is laid out on the table
um so I think that's something that may

2788
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:07,440
um so I think that's something that may
 

2789
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,490
um so I think that's something that may
be practiced in my own work with clients

2790
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:10,500
be practiced in my own work with clients
 

2791
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:14,450
be practiced in my own work with clients

2793
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:16,790
I've just noticed that um the the

Partners who are
happier in these situations who I've

2796
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:18,960
happier in these situations who I've
 

2797
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,650
happier in these situations who I've
worked with they are more experienced at

2798
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:21,660

2885
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:53,030
does and it's a little scary though
because I know what fear does

2886

because I know what fear does
 

2887
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,730
because I know what fear does
cognitively and there is a sweet spot

2888
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:55,740
cognitively and there is a sweet spot
 

2889
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:59,150
cognitively and there is a sweet spot
where you want some stress and then you

2890
00:54:59,150 --> 00:54:59,160
where you want some stress and then you
 

2891
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,910
where you want some stress and then you
can be really acutely focused and

2892
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:01,920
can be really acutely focused and
 

2893
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,609
can be really acutely focused and
attuned but then if you go over this

2894
00:55:04,609 --> 00:55:04,619
attuned but then if you go over this
 

2895
00:55:04,619 --> 00:55:07,430
attuned but then if you go over this
threshold you get sort of that frontal

2896
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:07,440
threshold you get sort of that frontal
 

2897
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,349
threshold you get sort of that frontal
lobe shutdown where you're not thinking

2898
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:09,359
lobe shutdown where you're not thinking
 

2899
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:10,609
lobe shutdown where you're not thinking
clearly and everybody knows that

2900
00:55:10,609 --> 00:55:10,619
clearly and everybody knows that
 

2901
00:55:10,619 --> 00:55:11,750
clearly and everybody knows that
experience from taking a really

2902
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:11,760

pressure about each single word I choose

3008
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:17,220
pressure about each single word I choose
 

3009

having to answer and then I don't even
have the luxury of thinking about myself

court that that becomes my focus and
 

3033
00:57:48,359 --> 00:57:51,410
court that that becomes my focus and
that's the godsend is that I can stop

the mmpi too which is one I talked a lot

3054
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:10,200
the mmpi too which is one I talked a lot

3061
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,390
is it has like its output the results
has some basic skills as code types and

things are really complicated there's
 

3075
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,730
things are really complicated there's
like we many of them we don't understand

like we many of them we don't understand
well this seems to be a huge amount of

3078
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:43,140
well this seems to be a huge amount of
 

3079
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:46,190
well this seems to be a huge amount of
variance and yet you have to be able to

3080
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:46,200
variance and yet you have to be able to
 

3081
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,569
variance and yet you have to be able to
stitch together a bunch of

3082
00:58:47,569 --> 00:58:47,579
stitch together a bunch of
 

3083
00:58:47,579 --> 00:58:49,609

00:58:56,329 --> 00:58:56,339
want to be able to have tests that get
 

3091
00:58:56,339 --> 00:58:59,270
want to be able to have tests that get
you closer to identifying The Peculiar

3092
00:58:59,270 --> 00:58:59,280
you closer to identifying The Peculiar
 

3093
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:03,049
you closer to identifying The Peculiar
flaws or uh beauties of a particular

flaws or uh beauties of a particular
 

3095
00:59:03,059 --> 00:59:05,990
flaws or uh beauties of a particular
mind so this seems to do a good job just

3096
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:06,000
mind so this seems to do a good job just
 

3097

mind so this seems to do a good job just
reading through the different

reading through the different
 

3099
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:09,770
reading through the different
descriptions of the code testify that

3100
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:09,780
descriptions of the code testify that
 

3101
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,990
descriptions of the code testify that
was the best description I don't know

3102
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:12,000
was the best description I don't know

questions

3122
00:59:36,349 --> 00:59:36,359
questions
 

3123
00:59:36,359 --> 00:59:37,609
questions
I'm going to tell you what's most

3124
00:59:37,609 --> 00:59:37,619
I'm going to tell you what's most
 

3125
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:39,950
I'm going to tell you what's most
beautiful about this test so they used

3126
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:39,960
beautiful about this test so they used
 

3127
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,589
beautiful about this test so they used
an empirical keying method to develop it

3128
00:59:42,589 --> 00:59:42,599
an empirical keying method to develop it
 

3129
00:59:42,599 --> 00:59:45,950
an empirical keying method to develop it
what that means is that they didn't have

3130
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:45,960
what that means is that they didn't have
 

3131

and say let's ask them
 

3135
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,250
and say let's ask them
um let's make sure that we identify

um let's make sure that we identify
 

3137
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:54,650
um let's make sure that we identify
people who have somatic complaints or

3138
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:54,660
people who have somatic complaints or
 

3139
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,270
people who have somatic complaints or
physical complaints by asking them

3140
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:56,280
physical complaints by asking them
 

3141
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:59,030
physical complaints by asking them
questions about like numbness in their

3142
00:59:59,030 --> 00:59:59,040
questions about like numbness in their
 

3143
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,069
questions about like numbness in their
hands nothing like that what they did

3144
01:00:01,069 --> 01:00:01,079

take a thousand questions at a group of
 

3149
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,130
take a thousand questions at a group of
people who they know at a certain mental

illness and a group of people who didn't
 

3153
01:00:08,579 --> 01:00:10,670
illness and a group of people who didn't
have that mental illness and then they

3154
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:10,680
have that mental illness and then they
 

3155
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:14,390
have that mental illness and then they
looked for patterns in what the people

3156
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:14,400
looked for patterns in what the people
 

3157
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,010
looked for patterns in what the people
with the mental illness

3158
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:16,020

endorsed as yes and no of those random
 

3161
01:00:20,099 --> 01:00:22,490
endorsed as yes and no of those random
questions so it would be for instance

3162
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:22,500
questions so it would be for instance
 

3163
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,470
questions so it would be for instance
there's a bronze light fixture right

3164
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:24,480
there's a bronze light fixture right
 

3165
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,510
there's a bronze light fixture right
there one of the questions out of the

that are bronze true or false and they

3170
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:32,760
that are bronze true or false and they
 

3171
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,849
that are bronze true or false and they
looked for correlations in the way

3172
01:00:34,849 --> 01:00:34,859
looked for correlations in the way
 

3173
01:00:34,859 --> 01:00:36,890
looked for correlations in the way
people would answer to these completely

3174
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:36,900
people would answer to these completely
 

3175
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:40,490
people would answer to these completely
innocuous just boring questions so there

3176
01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:40,500
innocuous just boring questions so there
 

3177
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:44,089
innocuous just boring questions so there
was no real way that a test taker could

3178
01:00:44,089 --> 01:00:44,099
was no real way that a test taker could
 

3179
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:47,950
was no real way that a test taker could
foresee the point of answering

3180
01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:47,960
foresee the point of answering
 

3181
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,870
foresee the point of answering
and so because they can't foresee it's

3182
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:50,880
and so because they can't foresee it's
 

3183
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,549
and so because they can't foresee it's
very difficult to cheat to get to a

01:00:52,549 --> 01:00:52,559
very difficult to cheat to get to a
 

3185
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:54,230
very difficult to cheat to get to a
conclusion very difficult and not only

3186
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:54,240
conclusion very difficult and not only
 

3187
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,690
conclusion very difficult and not only
that but you can imagine using that

3188
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:56,700
that but you can imagine using that
 

3189
01:00:56,700 --> 01:01:00,470
that but you can imagine using that
approach you can then look for patterns

3190
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:00,480
approach you can then look for patterns

01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:09,780
illness you just get a comparison group
 

3199
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:11,930
illness you just get a comparison group
and then a group who's using that

3200
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:11,940
and then a group who's using that
 

3201
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:14,270
and then a group who's using that
specific strategy or has that specific

um and you just look for patterns

3208
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:20,880
um and you just look for patterns
 

3209
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:24,530
um and you just look for patterns
and there's a scale output of different

3210
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:24,540
and there's a scale output of different
 

3211
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:25,670
and there's a scale output of different
kinds

3212

kinds
 

3213
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:29,510

so types yep so we've got you've got

3214
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:29,520
so types yep so we've got you've got
 

3215
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,450
so types yep so we've got you've got
validity scales and those are just

3216
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:32,460
validity scales and those are just
 

3217
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:34,789
validity scales and those are just
fascinating and often one of the most

3218
01:01:34,789 --> 01:01:34,799
fascinating and often one of the most
 

3219
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:37,130

they're answering questions about
 

3227
01:01:44,339 --> 01:01:46,849
they're answering questions about
themselves so for instance you can see

um you know driven for a specific
 

3265
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:28,430
um you know driven for a specific
outcome or gain it's just fascinating

3266
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:28,440
outcome or gain it's just fascinating
 

3267
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,470
outcome or gain it's just fascinating
and it's the most well-developed

3268
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:30,480
and it's the most well-developed
 

3269
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:34,250
and it's the most well-developed
assessment we have for a person's

assessment we have for a person's
 

3271
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:36,349
assessment we have for a person's
approach to

01:02:36,349 --> 01:02:36,359
approach to
 

3273
01:02:36,359 --> 01:02:38,270
approach to
answering questions about themselves so

3274
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:38,280
answering questions about themselves so
 

3275
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:40,190
answering questions about themselves so
it gives you the context of how honest

3276
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:40,200
it gives you the context of how honest
 

3277
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,349
it gives you the context of how honest
they're being the state of the person is

3278
01:02:42,349 --> 01:02:42,359
they're being the state of the person is
 

3279
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:44,510
they're being the state of the person is
their answer to them yeah yeah their

3280
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:44,520
their answer to them yeah yeah their
 

3281
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,370
their answer to them yeah yeah their
honesty their how forthcoming they're

3282
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:46,380
honesty their how forthcoming they're
 

3283
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:48,470
honesty their how forthcoming they're
being and how accurate they're being and

being and how accurate they're being and
 

3285
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,910
being and how accurate they're being and
then the the result of the

3286
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:49,920
then the the result of the
 

3287
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,069
then the the result of the
classification based on the test is are

3288
01:02:52,069 --> 01:02:52,079
classification based on the test is are
 

3289
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:54,410
classification based on the test is are
these code types right well so you have

3290
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:54,420
these code types right well so you have
 

3291
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:56,930
these code types right well so you have
these clinical skills as well you have

3292
01:02:56,930 --> 01:02:56,940
these clinical skills as well you have
 

3293
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,609
these clinical skills as well you have
10 clinical skills that look for

01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:08,329
anything good about yourself at best it
just tells you that you're not

3304
01:03:08,329 --> 01:03:08,339
just tells you that you're not
 

3305
01:03:08,339 --> 01:03:11,270
just tells you that you're not
responding in a way that is uh dishonest

3306
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:11,280
responding in a way that is uh dishonest
 

3307
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:15,289
responding in a way that is uh dishonest
and that you are uh kind not hugely

3308
01:03:15,289 --> 01:03:15,299
and that you are uh kind not hugely
 

3309
01:03:15,299 --> 01:03:17,329
and that you are uh kind not hugely
problematic but there's you know it's

3310
01:03:17,329 --> 01:03:17,339
problematic but there's you know it's
 

3311
01:03:17,339 --> 01:03:18,710
problematic but there's you know it's
not looking for strength so you have

3312
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:18,720
not looking for strength so you have
 

3313
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,510
not looking for strength so you have
these 10 clinical scales that look for

3314
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:20,520
these 10 clinical scales that look for
 

3315
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:23,150
these 10 clinical scales that look for
variations above the mean of the

3316
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:23,160
variations above the mean of the
 

3317
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,010
variations above the mean of the
population

3318
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:25,020
population
 

3319
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:27,710
population
um in certain areas anywhere from you

3320
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:27,720
um in certain areas anywhere from you
 

3321
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,750
um in certain areas anywhere from you
know depressive symptoms manic symptoms

3322
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:29,760

aggression social engagement whole scope
 

3327
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,410
aggression social engagement whole scope
of human experience and then there are

3328
01:03:39,410 --> 01:03:39,420
of human experience and then there are
 

3329
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:42,829
of human experience and then there are
much more nuanced scales from those so

3330
01:03:42,829 --> 01:03:42,839
much more nuanced scales from those so
 

3331
01:03:42,839 --> 01:03:45,950
much more nuanced scales from those so
little sub scales and then the real

3332
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:45,960
little sub scales and then the real
 

3333
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:48,829
little sub scales and then the real
power though of the mmpi2 is in as you

3334
01:03:48,829 --> 01:03:48,839
power though of the mmpi2 is in as you
 

3335
01:03:48,839 --> 01:03:50,569
power though of the mmpi2 is in as you
said these code types and these code

3336
01:03:50,569 --> 01:03:50,579
said these code types and these code
 

3337
01:03:50,579 --> 01:03:53,809
said these code types and these code
types are additional patterns that have

3338
01:03:53,809 --> 01:03:53,819
types are additional patterns that have
 

3339
01:03:53,819 --> 01:03:56,990
types are additional patterns that have
been detected that really can be more

3340
01:03:56,990 --> 01:03:57,000
been detected that really can be more
 

3341
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,930
been detected that really can be more
defining of a personality so you look

3342
01:03:59,930 --> 01:03:59,940
defining of a personality so you look
 

3343
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:01,789
defining of a personality so you look
for Peaks there can be either two

3344
01:04:01,789 --> 01:04:01,799
for Peaks there can be either two
 

3345
01:04:01,799 --> 01:04:04,910
for Peaks there can be either two
extreme Peaks or three typically that

3346
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:04,920
extreme Peaks or three typically that
 

3347
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,549
extreme Peaks or three typically that
make a code type and those Peaks are

3348
01:04:07,549 --> 01:04:07,559
make a code type and those Peaks are
 

3349
01:04:07,559 --> 01:04:10,430
make a code type and those Peaks are
higher scores on these personality

3350
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:10,440
higher scores on these personality
 

3351
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,470
higher scores on these personality
traits and specific code types can give

3352
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:12,480
traits and specific code types can give
 

3353
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,049
traits and specific code types can give
you a very nuanced picture of a person's

3354
01:04:15,049 --> 01:04:15,059
you a very nuanced picture of a person's
 

3355
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:17,750
you a very nuanced picture of a person's
General approach to life and their

3356
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:17,760
General approach to life and their
 

3357
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,730
General approach to life and their
personal relationships just their

3358
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:19,740
personal relationships just their
 

3359
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:22,309
personal relationships just their
personality so you can build on top of

3360
01:04:22,309 --> 01:04:22,319
personality so you can build on top of
 

3361
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:24,770
personality so you can build on top of
those code types and understanding yeah

3362
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:24,780
those code types and understanding yeah
 

3363
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:26,450
those code types and understanding yeah
how that person is going to deal with

3364
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:26,460
how that person is going to deal with
 

3365
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:27,950
how that person is going to deal with
different kinds of situations and then

3366
01:04:27,950 --> 01:04:27,960
different kinds of situations and then
 

3367
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,510
different kinds of situations and then
there's by the way a lot of code types

3368
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:29,520
there's by the way a lot of code types
 

3369
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,430
there's by the way a lot of code types
there are a lot of questions pretty

3370
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:31,440
there are a lot of questions pretty
 

3371
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,370
there are a lot of questions pretty
interesting it is

3372
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:33,380
interesting it is
 

3373
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:36,349
interesting it is
I was I wanted to see which one I would

3374
01:04:36,349 --> 01:04:36,359
I was I wanted to see which one I would
 

3375
01:04:36,359 --> 01:04:38,089
I was I wanted to see which one I would
I have given it to some people in my

3376
01:04:38,089 --> 01:04:38,099
I have given it to some people in my
 

3377
01:04:38,099 --> 01:04:40,609
I have given it to some people in my
life it's just phenomenal how hard is it

3378
01:04:40,609 --> 01:04:40,619
life it's just phenomenal how hard is it
 

3379
01:04:40,619 --> 01:04:42,230
life it's just phenomenal how hard is it
on your side of the table to give the

3380
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:42,240
on your side of the table to give the
 

3381
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:45,170
on your side of the table to give the
test oh it's easy you just Proctor you

3382
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:45,180
test oh it's easy you just Proctor you
 

3383
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:46,910
test oh it's easy you just Proctor you
just make sure that somebody there's no

3384
01:04:46,910 --> 01:04:46,920
just make sure that somebody there's no
 

3385
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:48,710
just make sure that somebody there's no
distraction that they're well rested

3386
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:48,720
distraction that they're well rested
 

3387
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,270
distraction that they're well rested
they are sitting there and they can just

3388
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:50,280
they are sitting there and they can just
 

3389
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,970
they are sitting there and they can just
take it in front of you so I guess the

3390
01:04:52,970 --> 01:04:52,980
take it in front of you so I guess the
 

3391
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:54,289
take it in front of you so I guess the
question is because the questions are

3392
01:04:54,289 --> 01:04:54,299
question is because the questions are
 

3393
01:04:54,299 --> 01:04:56,390
question is because the questions are
well designed in that it's hard to mess

3394
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:56,400
well designed in that it's hard to mess
 

3395
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,789
well designed in that it's hard to mess
with them you just give the it's very

3396
01:04:58,789 --> 01:04:58,799
with them you just give the it's very
 

3397
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:01,549
with them you just give the it's very
hard to beat it you just hand it to them

3398
01:05:01,549 --> 01:05:01,559
hard to beat it you just hand it to them
 

3399
01:05:01,559 --> 01:05:04,789
hard to beat it you just hand it to them
and it's yes and no it's yes and no

3400
01:05:04,789 --> 01:05:04,799
and it's yes and no it's yes and no
 

3401
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:09,170
and it's yes and no it's yes and no
okay but I should also add to this that

3402
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:09,180
okay but I should also add to this that
 

3403
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:12,230
okay but I should also add to this that
this test as much as I love it and um it

3404
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:12,240
this test as much as I love it and um it
 

3405
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,970
this test as much as I love it and um it
is the most researched and widely used

3406
01:05:13,970 --> 01:05:13,980
is the most researched and widely used
 

3407
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:16,670
is the most researched and widely used
personality assessment in the world

3408
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:16,680
personality assessment in the world
 

3409
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:17,390
personality assessment in the world
um

3410
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:17,400
um
 

3411
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:20,809
um
it is not in and of itself definitive so

3412
01:05:20,809 --> 01:05:20,819
it is not in and of itself definitive so
 

3413
01:05:20,819 --> 01:05:23,270
it is not in and of itself definitive so
you use it like you already have sort of

3414
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:23,280
you use it like you already have sort of
 

3415
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,430
you use it like you already have sort of
a hypothesis and you use this for

3416
01:05:25,430 --> 01:05:25,440
a hypothesis and you use this for
 

3417
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,589
a hypothesis and you use this for
clarification okay

3418
01:05:27,589 --> 01:05:27,599
clarification okay
 

3419
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:30,289
clarification okay
um and it has a ton of value for showing

3420
01:05:30,289 --> 01:05:30,299
um and it has a ton of value for showing
 

3421
01:05:30,299 --> 01:05:33,589
um and it has a ton of value for showing
somebody's response or their approach

3422
01:05:33,589 --> 01:05:33,599
somebody's response or their approach
 

3423
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:35,329
somebody's response or their approach
um how forthcoming they're being but

3424
01:05:35,329 --> 01:05:35,339
um how forthcoming they're being but
 

3425
01:05:35,339 --> 01:05:37,370
um how forthcoming they're being but
other than that you really need to

3426
01:05:37,370 --> 01:05:37,380
other than that you really need to
 

3427
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:39,289
other than that you really need to
consider it as a piece of the puzzle you

3428
01:05:39,289 --> 01:05:39,299
consider it as a piece of the puzzle you
 

3429
01:05:39,299 --> 01:05:40,970
consider it as a piece of the puzzle you
had said stitched together earlier and

3430
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:40,980
had said stitched together earlier and
 

3431
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:42,410
had said stitched together earlier and
that was just one of those points you

3432
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:42,420
that was just one of those points you
 

3433
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:45,109
that was just one of those points you
made that was perfect for describing

made that was perfect for describing
this

3436
01:05:46,190 --> 01:05:46,200
this
 

3437
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,990
this
there's probably no one perfect test

3438
01:05:47,990 --> 01:05:48,000
there's probably no one perfect test
 

3439
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,589
there's probably no one perfect test
right for personality no

3440
01:05:51,589 --> 01:05:51,599
right for personality no
 

3441
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:55,309

the criteria are met that diagnosis is
given so as we have it right now with

and I think that will probably get
 

3593
01:09:02,279 --> 01:09:04,189
and I think that will probably get
sussed out if we do move to a more

Spectrum based approach because then you

3596
01:09:05,749 --> 01:09:05,759
Spectrum based approach because then you
 

3597
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:07,370
Spectrum based approach because then you
would be describing sort of a

3598
01:09:07,370 --> 01:09:07,380
would be describing sort of a
 

3599
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:08,870
would be describing sort of a
personality disorder and then you would

3600
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:08,880
personality disorder and then you would
 

3601
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,930
personality disorder and then you would
add the traits to it so you know with

3602
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:11,940
add the traits to it so you know with
 

3603
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:14,209
add the traits to it so you know with
issues and interpersonal functioning and

01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:41,760
different symptoms and you only need
 

3785
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,790
different symptoms and you only need
five to meet criteria so depending on

3786
01:12:43,790 --> 01:12:43,800
five to meet criteria so depending on
 

3787
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,910
five to meet criteria so depending on
which symptoms you have you might be far

3788
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:46,920
which symptoms you have you might be far
 

3789
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:50,149
which symptoms you have you might be far
more calculated conniving manipulative

3790
01:12:50,149 --> 01:12:50,159
more calculated conniving manipulative
 

3791
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:52,550
more calculated conniving manipulative
or you may just be more of the impulsive

3792
01:12:52,550 --> 01:12:52,560
or you may just be more of the impulsive
 

3793
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,709
or you may just be more of the impulsive
kind of messy emotionally erratic type

3794
01:12:54,709 --> 01:12:54,719
kind of messy emotionally erratic type
 

3795
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:56,750
kind of messy emotionally erratic type
and so there's some new research also

3796
01:12:56,750 --> 01:12:56,760
and so there's some new research also
 

3797
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:59,090
and so there's some new research also
coming out that's even suggested that

3798
01:12:59,090 --> 01:12:59,100
coming out that's even suggested that
 

3799
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:00,550
coming out that's even suggested that
among women

3800
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:00,560
among women
 

3801
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,649
among women
those that score higher in some of these

3802
01:13:03,649 --> 01:13:03,659
those that score higher in some of these
 

3803
01:13:03,659 --> 01:13:05,930
those that score higher in some of these
more calculated traits of the disorder

3804
01:13:05,930 --> 01:13:05,940
more calculated traits of the disorder
 

3805
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:09,050
more calculated traits of the disorder
may actually be it may be a certain

3806
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:09,060
may actually be it may be a certain
 

3807
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:12,530
may actually be it may be a certain
presentation of female psychopathy

01:13:12,530 --> 01:13:12,540
presentation of female psychopathy
 

3809
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:15,590
presentation of female psychopathy
yeah are are some of these personality

3810
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:15,600
yeah are are some of these personality
 

3811
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,930
yeah are are some of these personality
disorders again probably impossible

3812
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:17,940
disorders again probably impossible
 

3813
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:19,669
disorders again probably impossible
question to answer but

3814
01:13:19,669 --> 01:13:19,679
question to answer but
 

3815
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:21,950
question to answer but
how much of it is nature how much of it

3816
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:21,960
how much of it is nature how much of it
 

3817
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:25,010
how much of it is nature how much of it
is nurture or how much of it is in the

3818
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:25,020
is nurture or how much of it is in the
 

3819
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:27,770
is nurture or how much of it is in the
genetics and you just can't do much with

3820
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:27,780
genetics and you just can't do much with
 

3821
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:30,470
genetics and you just can't do much with
uh maybe another question a different

3822
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:30,480
uh maybe another question a different
 

3823
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,630
uh maybe another question a different
way to ask that is how much can you help

3824
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:32,640
way to ask that is how much can you help
 

3825
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:36,350
way to ask that is how much can you help
that how how much can you become better

3826
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:36,360
that how how much can you become better
 

3827
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:38,810
that how how much can you become better
that is a tough question so there's been

3828
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:38,820
that is a tough question so there's been
 

3829
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:41,689
that is a tough question so there's been
a ton of change in the way we've thought

3830
01:13:41,689 --> 01:13:41,699
a ton of change in the way we've thought
 

3831
01:13:41,699 --> 01:13:44,630
a ton of change in the way we've thought
about the etiology of these personality

3832
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:44,640
about the etiology of these personality
 

3833
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,610
about the etiology of these personality
disorders specific to borderline

personality disorder I think in general
the view is that most people believe

3838
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:52,560
the view is that most people believe
 

3839
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,550
the view is that most people believe
that it was associated with neglect or

3840
01:13:55,550 --> 01:13:55,560
that it was associated with neglect or
 

3841
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:57,169
that it was associated with neglect or
trauma and childhood

3842
01:13:57,169 --> 01:13:57,179
trauma and childhood
 

3843
01:13:57,179 --> 01:13:59,330
trauma and childhood
while there is a correlation there

3844
01:13:59,330 --> 01:13:59,340
while there is a correlation there
 

3845
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:01,370
while there is a correlation there
there's a correlation between that and

3846
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:01,380
there's a correlation between that and
 

3847
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:03,350
there's a correlation between that and
many mental health issues not just

3848
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:03,360
many mental health issues not just
 

3849
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:06,050
many mental health issues not just
borderline personality disorder we also

3850
01:14:06,050 --> 01:14:06,060
borderline personality disorder we also

borderline personality disorder we also
there is evidence to support a genetic

3852
01:14:08,209 --> 01:14:08,219
there is evidence to support a genetic
 

3853
01:14:08,219 --> 01:14:11,149
there is evidence to support a genetic
basis for this personality disorder and

3854
01:14:11,149 --> 01:14:11,159
basis for this personality disorder and
 

3855
01:14:11,159 --> 01:14:12,830
basis for this personality disorder and
there are people who have borderline

3856
01:14:12,830 --> 01:14:12,840
there are people who have borderline
 

3857
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:15,590
there are people who have borderline
personality disorders that report no

3858
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:15,600
personality disorders that report no
 

3859

childhood trauma or difficulty
 

3861
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,130
childhood trauma or difficulty
um and I've and I have seen I you know

3862
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:21,140
um and I've and I have seen I you know
 

3863
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:24,110
um and I've and I have seen I you know
sometimes things just happen so

3864
01:14:24,110 --> 01:14:24,120
sometimes things just happen so
 

3865
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:26,450
sometimes things just happen so
I think it's a mix I think we need to

3866
01:14:26,450 --> 01:14:26,460
I think it's a mix I think we need to
 

3867
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:28,669
I think it's a mix I think we need to
think of it as biopsychosocial which is

3868
01:14:28,669 --> 01:14:28,679
think of it as biopsychosocial which is
 

3869
01:14:28,679 --> 01:14:30,590
think of it as biopsychosocial which is
generally the answer to most things when

3870
01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:30,600
generally the answer to most things when
 

3871
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,330
generally the answer to most things when
you're talking about how a mental health

3872
01:14:32,330 --> 01:14:32,340
you're talking about how a mental health
 

3873
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:34,370
you're talking about how a mental health
issue comes to be

3874
01:14:34,370 --> 01:14:34,380
issue comes to be
 

3875
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:39,590
issue comes to be
um I certainly think that in most cases

3876
01:14:39,590 --> 01:14:39,600
um I certainly think that in most cases
 

3877
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,630
um I certainly think that in most cases
and here's just me speaking personally

3878
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:41,640
and here's just me speaking personally
 

3879
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:44,090
and here's just me speaking personally
again I think in my own work in most

3880
01:14:44,090 --> 01:14:44,100
again I think in my own work in most
 

3881
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:47,630
again I think in my own work in most
cases what I see is that somebody may

3882
01:14:47,630 --> 01:14:47,640
cases what I see is that somebody may
 

3883
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,149
cases what I see is that somebody may
have some sort of predisposition then

3884
01:14:50,149 --> 01:14:50,159
have some sort of predisposition then
 

3885
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:52,550
have some sort of predisposition then
they go through certain life events and

3886
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:52,560
they go through certain life events and
 

3887
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:55,669
they go through certain life events and
learn patterns of Behaving that may

3888
01:14:55,669 --> 01:14:55,679
learn patterns of Behaving that may
 

3889
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:57,709
learn patterns of Behaving that may
serve them well as a child in a

3890
01:14:57,709 --> 01:14:57,719
serve them well as a child in a
 

3891
01:14:57,719 --> 01:14:59,510
serve them well as a child in a
dysfunctional situation but end up being

3892
01:14:59,510 --> 01:14:59,520
dysfunctional situation but end up being
 

3893
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,630
dysfunctional situation but end up being
very problematic later on or they just

3894
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:02,640
very problematic later on or they just
 

3895
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,490
very problematic later on or they just
have enough hardship that that Gene

3896
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:04,500
have enough hardship that that Gene
 

3897
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,709
have enough hardship that that Gene
whatever it was lying dormant that

01:15:06,709 --> 01:15:06,719
whatever it was lying dormant that

little borderline personality disorder
Gene expresses itself and you'll see

3902
01:15:10,370 --> 01:15:10,380
Gene expresses itself and you'll see
 

3903
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:11,930
Gene expresses itself and you'll see
that with things like schizophrenia

3904
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:11,940
that with things like schizophrenia
 

3905
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:15,050
that with things like schizophrenia
depression anxiety disorders there tend

3906
01:15:15,050 --> 01:15:15,060
depression anxiety disorders there tend
 

3907
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:16,729
depression anxiety disorders there tend
to be certain ages where you'll just see

3908
01:15:16,729 --> 01:15:16,739
to be certain ages where you'll just see
 

3909
01:15:16,739 --> 01:15:20,330
to be certain ages where you'll just see
that expression happen

3910
01:15:20,330 --> 01:15:20,340
that expression happen
 

3911
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:22,790
that expression happen
all right for the record it got cold in

3912
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:22,800
all right for the record it got cold in
 

3913
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:27,310
all right for the record it got cold in
here so we upgraded with a blanket

3914
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:27,320

 

3915
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:31,130

you look cozy uh just as a question for

3916
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:31,140
you look cozy uh just as a question for
 

3917
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:34,570
you look cozy uh just as a question for
me just observing the trial it was

3918
01:15:34,570 --> 01:15:34,580
me just observing the trial it was
 

3919
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:36,290
me just observing the trial it was
interesting

3920
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:36,300
interesting
 

3921
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:38,930
interesting
that first of all is a really

3922
01:15:38,930 --> 01:15:38,940
that first of all is a really
 

3923
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:42,590
that first of all is a really
raw and honest exploration of

3924
01:15:42,590 --> 01:15:42,600
raw and honest exploration of
 

3925
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,450
raw and honest exploration of
intimate relationship between two people

3926
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:44,460
intimate relationship between two people
 

3927
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:46,729
intimate relationship between two people
oh yeah it was interesting to watch I

3928
01:15:46,729 --> 01:15:46,739
oh yeah it was interesting to watch I
 

3929
01:15:46,739 --> 01:15:48,410
oh yeah it was interesting to watch I
suppose I haven't watched that kind of

3930
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:48,420
suppose I haven't watched that kind of
 

3931
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:49,430
suppose I haven't watched that kind of
thing

3932
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:49,440
thing
 

3933
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,830
thing
it made me think about what makes for a

3934
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:51,840
it made me think about what makes for a
 

3935
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,149
it made me think about what makes for a
good relationship

3936
01:15:53,149 --> 01:15:53,159
good relationship
 

3937

all the all the many things we've
 

3939
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:55,970
all the all the many things we've
already talked about in this

3940
01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:55,980

3941
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:57,169
already talked about in this
conversation

3942
01:15:57,169 --> 01:15:57,179
conversation
 

3943

3951
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,010
that there's recordings it's kind of
interesting the act of recording your

3952
01:16:10,010 --> 01:16:10,020
interesting the act of recording your

that or so on but the fact that you have
this data made me wonder like if I

3958

this data made me wonder like if I
 

3959
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:20,330
this data made me wonder like if I
recorded myself how would I sound like

3960
01:16:20,330 --> 01:16:20,340
recorded myself how would I sound like

after if they start to get nasty with
 

3997
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:08,390
after if they start to get nasty with
each other in the session I can stop it

3998
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:08,400
each other in the session I can stop it
 

3999
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,570
each other in the session I can stop it
and I can say what was that right and

4000
01:17:11,570 --> 01:17:11,580
and I can say what was that right and
 

4001
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:13,910
and I can say what was that right and
most of the time that what you're

4002
01:17:13,910 --> 01:17:13,920
most of the time that what you're
 

4003
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,830
most of the time that what you're
describing is so useful because we don't

4004
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:15,840
describing is so useful because we don't
 

4005
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,110
describing is so useful because we don't
see ourselves we have no idea that we

see ourselves we have no idea that we
 

4007

something like that if they can actually
 

4023
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:37,310
something like that if they can actually
see themselves they realize no their jaw

4024

it's such a uh it's almost unbelievable
 

4101
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:07,430
it's such a uh it's almost unbelievable
that humans created it

4102
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:07,440
that humans created it
 

4103
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:08,930
that humans created it
um but I think that goes back to that

4104
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:08,940
um but I think that goes back to that
 

4105
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:10,669
um but I think that goes back to that
empirical key method of creating

4106
01:19:10,669 --> 01:19:10,679
empirical key method of creating
 

4107
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:13,370
empirical key method of creating
something that enabled it to be as

4108
01:19:13,370 --> 01:19:13,380
something that enabled it to be as
 

4109
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:16,250
something that enabled it to be as
robust as it is and something that is

4110
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:16,260
robust as it is and something that is
 

4111
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:19,370
robust as it is and something that is
very difficult to beat if not impossible

4112
01:19:19,370 --> 01:19:19,380
very difficult to beat if not impossible
 

4113
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:23,750
very difficult to beat if not impossible
um but the code types really so it

4114
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:23,760
um but the code types really so it
 

4115
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:26,450
um but the code types really so it
depends on in any forensic case what

4116
01:19:26,450 --> 01:19:26,460
depends on in any forensic case what
 

4117
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:29,270
depends on in any forensic case what
really matters is the legal psycho legal

4118
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:29,280
really matters is the legal psycho legal
 

4119
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,070
really matters is the legal psycho legal
questions so what is the legal question

4120
01:19:31,070 --> 01:19:31,080
questions so what is the legal question
 

4121
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:34,010
questions so what is the legal question
and then what is the psychologist's

4122
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:34,020
and then what is the psychologist's
 

4123
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:35,630
and then what is the psychologist's
responsibility in assisting with

4124
01:19:35,630 --> 01:19:35,640
responsibility in assisting with
 

4125
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,010
responsibility in assisting with
whatever question they're being asked

4126
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:37,020
whatever question they're being asked
 

4127
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:38,270
whatever question they're being asked
and there are some questions we can't

4128
01:19:38,270 --> 01:19:38,280
and there are some questions we can't
 

4129
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,790
and there are some questions we can't
answer some that we can

4130
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:40,800
answer some that we can
 

4131
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,649
answer some that we can
um you don't always need to provide a

4132
01:19:42,649 --> 01:19:42,659
um you don't always need to provide a
 

4133
01:19:42,659 --> 01:19:45,229
um you don't always need to provide a
diagnosis when you're asked to provide a

4134
01:19:45,229 --> 01:19:45,239
diagnosis when you're asked to provide a
 

4135
01:19:45,239 --> 01:19:47,390
diagnosis when you're asked to provide a
report it depends on the jurisdiction it

4136
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:47,400
report it depends on the jurisdiction it
 

4137
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,590
report it depends on the jurisdiction it
depends on the statute some

4138
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:48,600
depends on the statute some
 

4139
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,149
depends on the statute some
jurisdictions actually require a

4140
01:19:50,149 --> 01:19:50,159
jurisdictions actually require a
 

4141
01:19:50,159 --> 01:19:52,310
jurisdictions actually require a
diagnosis in this case I was asked to

4142
01:19:52,310 --> 01:19:52,320
diagnosis in this case I was asked to
 

4143
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,890
diagnosis in this case I was asked to
provide a diagnosis so when I'm

4144
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:54,900
provide a diagnosis so when I'm
 

4145
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:57,050
provide a diagnosis so when I'm
considering a diagnosis you're

4146
01:19:57,050 --> 01:19:57,060
considering a diagnosis you're
 

4147
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:59,689
considering a diagnosis you're
integrating multiple different sources

4148
01:19:59,689 --> 01:19:59,699
integrating multiple different sources
 

4149
01:19:59,699 --> 01:20:01,910
integrating multiple different sources
of information you're integrating and

4150
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:01,920
of information you're integrating and
 

4151
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:05,470
of information you're integrating and
examining self-report you are adding

4152
01:20:05,470 --> 01:20:05,480
examining self-report you are adding
 

4153
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:08,689
examining self-report you are adding
collateral data usually I wasn't able to

4154
01:20:08,689 --> 01:20:08,699
collateral data usually I wasn't able to
 

4155
01:20:08,699 --> 01:20:10,910
collateral data usually I wasn't able to
obtain collateral interviews in this

4156
01:20:10,910 --> 01:20:10,920
obtain collateral interviews in this
 

4157
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:13,130
obtain collateral interviews in this
case and that was the decision of the

4158
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:13,140
case and that was the decision of the
 

4159
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:15,770
case and that was the decision of the
Court they said no collateral interviews

4160
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:15,780
Court they said no collateral interviews
 

4161
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:17,990
Court they said no collateral interviews
but typically that would be something

4162
01:20:17,990 --> 01:20:18,000
but typically that would be something
 

4163
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,090
but typically that would be something
that you would add you're looking at

4164
01:20:20,090 --> 01:20:20,100
that you would add you're looking at
 

4165
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:22,910
that you would add you're looking at
records ideally from birth up until the

4166
01:20:22,910 --> 01:20:22,920
records ideally from birth up until the
 

4167
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:26,570
records ideally from birth up until the
day that the alleged injury occurred and

4168
01:20:26,570 --> 01:20:26,580
day that the alleged injury occurred and
 

4169
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:28,189
day that the alleged injury occurred and
I'm speaking now specifically to a

4170
01:20:28,189 --> 01:20:28,199
I'm speaking now specifically to a
 

4171
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:30,229
I'm speaking now specifically to a
personal injury evaluation or something

4172
01:20:30,229 --> 01:20:30,239
personal injury evaluation or something
 

4173
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:31,910
personal injury evaluation or something
where somebody is claiming that they

4174
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:31,920
where somebody is claiming that they
 

4175
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:34,070
where somebody is claiming that they
were harmed psychologically

4176
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:34,080
were harmed psychologically
 

4177
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,689
were harmed psychologically
um but you want as many records as

4178
01:20:35,689 --> 01:20:35,699
um but you want as many records as
 

4179
01:20:35,699 --> 01:20:37,910
um but you want as many records as
possible to show how a person functioned

4180
01:20:37,910 --> 01:20:37,920
possible to show how a person functioned
 

4181
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:40,850
possible to show how a person functioned
before that event occurred and how they

4182
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:40,860
before that event occurred and how they
 

4183
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:43,010
before that event occurred and how they
functioned after and you want it to show

4184
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:43,020
functioned after and you want it to show
 

4185
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:44,630
functioned after and you want it to show
Financial functioning physical

4186
01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:44,640
Financial functioning physical
 

4187
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,550
Financial functioning physical
functioning academic functioning

4188
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:46,560
functioning academic functioning
 

4189
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:49,250
functioning academic functioning
basically where is there evidence that

4190
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:49,260
basically where is there evidence that
 

4191
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:51,830
basically where is there evidence that
something in their life changed

4192
01:20:51,830 --> 01:20:51,840
something in their life changed
 

4193
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,390
something in their life changed
um where is there evidence that harm

4194
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:53,400
um where is there evidence that harm
 

4195
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:55,490
um where is there evidence that harm
occurred other than from what they're

4196
01:20:55,490 --> 01:20:55,500
occurred other than from what they're
 

4197
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:59,930
occurred other than from what they're
telling you and uh in addition to all of

4198
01:20:59,930 --> 01:20:59,940
telling you and uh in addition to all of
 

4199
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:01,729
telling you and uh in addition to all of
those records that you're reviewing in

4200
01:21:01,729 --> 01:21:01,739
those records that you're reviewing in
 

4201
01:21:01,739 --> 01:21:03,830
those records that you're reviewing in
addition to their self-report then

4202
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:03,840
addition to their self-report then
 

4203
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,630
addition to their self-report then
you're also going to give some of these

4204
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:05,640
you're also going to give some of these
 

4205
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:08,390
you're also going to give some of these
tests like the mmpi so the code types

4206
01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:08,400
tests like the mmpi so the code types
 

4207
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:11,689
tests like the mmpi so the code types
are really that that strength of the

4208
01:21:11,689 --> 01:21:11,699
are really that that strength of the
 

4209
01:21:11,699 --> 01:21:13,729
are really that that strength of the
mmpi2 it gives you really nuanced

4210
01:21:13,729 --> 01:21:13,739
mmpi2 it gives you really nuanced
 

4211
01:21:13,739 --> 01:21:15,410
mmpi2 it gives you really nuanced
information about a person's personality

4212
01:21:15,410 --> 01:21:15,420
information about a person's personality
 

4213
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:17,870
information about a person's personality
now again you're not going to use the

4214
01:21:17,870 --> 01:21:17,880
now again you're not going to use the
 

4215
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:21,590
now again you're not going to use the
mmpi2 or any other test by itself to

4216
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:21,600
mmpi2 or any other test by itself to
 

4217
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,590
mmpi2 or any other test by itself to
diagnose someone or you know decide that

4218
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:24,600
diagnose someone or you know decide that
 

4219
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:25,910
diagnose someone or you know decide that
the person is telling the truth not

4220
01:21:25,910 --> 01:21:25,920
the person is telling the truth not
 

4221
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,290
the person is telling the truth not
telling the truth it is just another

4222
01:21:27,290 --> 01:21:27,300
telling the truth it is just another
 

4223
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:31,430
telling the truth it is just another
piece of data and when it's working the

4224
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:31,440
piece of data and when it's working the
 

4225
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,709
piece of data and when it's working the
way it's supposed to It lines up really

4226
01:21:33,709 --> 01:21:33,719
way it's supposed to It lines up really
 

4227
01:21:33,719 --> 01:21:36,110
way it's supposed to It lines up really
nicely with all of the other data you're

4228
01:21:36,110 --> 01:21:36,120
nicely with all of the other data you're
 

4229
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:38,030
nicely with all of the other data you're
getting including what you've observed

4230
01:21:38,030 --> 01:21:38,040
getting including what you've observed
 

4231
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:39,530
getting including what you've observed
from the person during your interview

4232
01:21:39,530 --> 01:21:39,540
from the person during your interview
 

4233
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:41,390
from the person during your interview
with them the information they're giving

4234
01:21:41,390 --> 01:21:41,400
with them the information they're giving
 

4235
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:43,669
with them the information they're giving
you or inconsistencies with information

4236
01:21:43,669 --> 01:21:43,679
you or inconsistencies with information
 

4237
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:46,189
you or inconsistencies with information
they're giving you the consistency or

4238
01:21:46,189 --> 01:21:46,199
they're giving you the consistency or
 

4239
01:21:46,199 --> 01:21:48,470
they're giving you the consistency or
inconsistency of their self-report from

4240
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:48,480
inconsistency of their self-report from
 

4241
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,990
inconsistency of their self-report from
the records what the records themselves

4242
01:21:50,990 --> 01:21:51,000
the records what the records themselves
 

4243
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,229
the records what the records themselves
say etc etc so it's adding it's helping

4244
01:21:54,229 --> 01:21:54,239
say etc etc so it's adding it's helping
 

4245
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:56,030
say etc etc so it's adding it's helping
you clarify and clarify and clarify the

4246
01:21:56,030 --> 01:21:56,040
you clarify and clarify and clarify the
 

4247
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:58,430
you clarify and clarify and clarify the
picture yeah just dialing it down more

4248
01:21:58,430 --> 01:21:58,440
picture yeah just dialing it down more
 

4249
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,770
picture yeah just dialing it down more
and more you're just making sure that it

4250
01:22:00,770 --> 01:22:00,780
and more you're just making sure that it
 

4251
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:02,570
and more you're just making sure that it
is as accurate as possible

4252
01:22:02,570 --> 01:22:02,580
is as accurate as possible
 

4253
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:05,330
is as accurate as possible
okay so given how huge this trial was

4254
01:22:05,330 --> 01:22:05,340
okay so given how huge this trial was
 

4255
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:08,510
okay so given how huge this trial was
given how eloquent you were you were I

4256
01:22:08,510 --> 01:22:08,520
given how eloquent you were you were I
 

4257
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,070
given how eloquent you were you were I
know you don't think of it that way but

trial after the trial
um

4306
01:23:10,729 --> 01:23:10,739
um
 

4307
01:23:10,739 --> 01:23:13,250
um
so let's tackle forensic psychologists

4308
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:13,260
so let's tackle forensic psychologists
 

4309
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:16,550
so let's tackle forensic psychologists
first sure okay so in terms of forensic

4310
01:23:16,550 --> 01:23:16,560
first sure okay so in terms of forensic
 

4311
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:17,930
first sure okay so in terms of forensic
psychology

4312
01:23:17,930 --> 01:23:17,940
psychology
 

4313
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:20,090

um I am grateful to that trial for

4314
01:23:20,090 --> 01:23:20,100

4319
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:29,270
um these Stakes were so high that I took
you know I was retained about two years

4320
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:29,280
you know I was retained about two years
 

4321
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:33,470
you know I was retained about two years
prior to the trial so I really delved

4322
01:23:33,470 --> 01:23:33,480
prior to the trial so I really delved
 

4323
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:36,470
prior to the trial so I really delved
deep into the academic side of forensic

4324
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:36,480
deep into the academic side of forensic
 

4325
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:39,169
deep into the academic side of forensic
psychology and making sure that

some of those lessons carried through to

4356
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:14,940
some of those lessons carried through to
 

4357
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:17,510
some of those lessons carried through to
your practice now to both research and

4358
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:17,520
your practice now to both research and
 

4359
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:20,209
your practice now to both research and
uh some of the things you're doing in

4360
01:24:20,209 --> 01:24:20,219
uh some of the things you're doing in
 

4361
01:24:20,219 --> 01:24:21,890
uh some of the things you're doing in
terms of helping couples

4362
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:21,900
terms of helping couples
 

4363
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:24,890
terms of helping couples
uh no I mean I just

4364
01:24:24,890 --> 01:24:24,900
uh no I mean I just
 

4365
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:26,930
uh no I mean I just
you know my practice hasn't changed that

4366
01:24:26,930 --> 01:24:26,940
you know my practice hasn't changed that
 

4367
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:31,130
you know my practice hasn't changed that
much uh this was more uh just something

4368
01:24:31,130 --> 01:24:31,140
much uh this was more uh just something
 

4369
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:33,830
much uh this was more uh just something
that was more it demanded so much more

4370
01:24:33,830 --> 01:24:33,840
that was more it demanded so much more
 

4371
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,930
that was more it demanded so much more
of my time than my typical forensic work

4372
01:24:35,930 --> 01:24:35,940
of my time than my typical forensic work
 

4373
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:38,330
of my time than my typical forensic work
does and personal injury cases are in

4374
01:24:38,330 --> 01:24:38,340
does and personal injury cases are in
 

4375
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:40,370
does and personal injury cases are in
cases where there is an allegation of

4376
01:24:40,370 --> 01:24:40,380
cases where there is an allegation of
 

4377
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:42,470
cases where there is an allegation of
trauma or psychological harm tend to be

4378
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:42,480
trauma or psychological harm tend to be
 

4379
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:46,189
trauma or psychological harm tend to be
super labor intensive this given um the

4380
01:24:46,189 --> 01:24:46,199
super labor intensive this given um the
 

4381
01:24:46,199 --> 01:24:48,169
super labor intensive this given um the
magnitude and how long it had been going

4382
01:24:48,169 --> 01:24:48,179
magnitude and how long it had been going
 

4383
01:24:48,179 --> 01:24:50,570
magnitude and how long it had been going
on in the back and forth required a ton

4384
01:24:50,570 --> 01:24:50,580
on in the back and forth required a ton
 

4385
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:53,330
on in the back and forth required a ton
of work before the trial as well so it

4386
01:24:53,330 --> 01:24:53,340
of work before the trial as well so it
 

4387
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:54,950
of work before the trial as well so it
pulled me away from the practice I think

4388
01:24:54,950 --> 01:24:54,960
pulled me away from the practice I think
 

4389
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:58,490
pulled me away from the practice I think
it's been nice to go back a bit if okay

4390
01:24:58,490 --> 01:24:58,500
it's been nice to go back a bit if okay
 

4391
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,709
it's been nice to go back a bit if okay
so now personally

4392
01:25:00,709 --> 01:25:00,719
so now personally
 

4393
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:02,209
so now personally
um I've learned some things I've learned

4394
01:25:02,209 --> 01:25:02,219
um I've learned some things I've learned
 

4395
01:25:02,219 --> 01:25:05,450
um I've learned some things I've learned
that I need to slow down a little bit

4396
01:25:05,450 --> 01:25:05,460
that I need to slow down a little bit
 

4397
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:08,270
that I need to slow down a little bit
so this took a lot from you it took a

4398
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:08,280
so this took a lot from you it took a
 

4399
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:10,729
so this took a lot from you it took a
lot but it was really the culmination I

4400
01:25:10,729 --> 01:25:10,739
lot but it was really the culmination I
 

4401
01:25:10,739 --> 01:25:12,770
lot but it was really the culmination I
feel like there are these hoops we jump

4402
01:25:12,770 --> 01:25:12,780
feel like there are these hoops we jump
 

4403
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:14,870
feel like there are these hoops we jump
through again and again you know

4404
01:25:14,870 --> 01:25:14,880
through again and again you know
 

4405
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:17,990
through again and again you know
academic challenges that we continue to

4406
01:25:17,990 --> 01:25:18,000
academic challenges that we continue to
 

4407
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,270
academic challenges that we continue to
meet and then there's a next one and a

4408
01:25:20,270 --> 01:25:20,280
meet and then there's a next one and a
 

4409
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:22,130
meet and then there's a next one and a
next one and a next one and in the

4410
01:25:22,130 --> 01:25:22,140
next one and a next one and in the
 

4411
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:24,350
next one and a next one and in the
beginning like when you're getting into

4412
01:25:24,350 --> 01:25:24,360
beginning like when you're getting into
 

4413
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:27,890
beginning like when you're getting into
college or applying to grad schools you

01:27:23,629 --> 01:27:23,639
explain that to people all day long but
 

4513
01:27:23,639 --> 01:27:25,669
explain that to people all day long but
it doesn't necessarily mean that it's

4514
01:27:25,669 --> 01:27:25,679
it doesn't necessarily mean that it's
 

4515
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:27,050
it doesn't necessarily mean that it's
going to be easy for someone to accept

4516
01:27:27,050 --> 01:27:27,060
going to be easy for someone to accept
 

4517
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:29,330
going to be easy for someone to accept
when I can't talk to them

4518
01:27:29,330 --> 01:27:29,340

4525
01:27:35,699 --> 01:27:37,850
know their sister just died and I can't
even get on a call because I'm getting

4526
01:27:37,850 --> 01:27:37,860
even get on a call because I'm getting
 

4527
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:40,550
even get on a call because I'm getting
maybe 15 messages like that a day

4539
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:53,629
that
um

4540
01:27:53,629 --> 01:27:53,639

4557
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:13,790
with it I I really believed that people
who talk like a lot about self-care were

4558
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:13,800
who talk like a lot about self-care were
 

4559
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:16,430
who talk like a lot about self-care were
kind of full of [\h__\h] and just didn't

I
kind of traversed into an area and

4570

4589
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:45,770
myself to do
the debt herd case reminded me of that

4590
01:28:45,770 --> 01:28:45,780
the debt herd case reminded me of that
 

4591
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:47,090
the debt herd case reminded me of that
feeling of pushing myself to do

feeling of pushing myself to do
 

4593

something I wasn't sure I was capable of
 

4595
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:51,169
something I wasn't sure I was capable of
and overcoming that challenge that was

4596
01:28:51,169 --> 01:28:51,179
and overcoming that challenge that was
 

4597
01:28:51,179 --> 01:28:53,990
and overcoming that challenge that was
rewarding but when you're piling that on

01:28:53,990 --> 01:28:54,000
rewarding but when you're piling that on

4640
01:29:44,209 --> 01:29:44,219
opportunity to work on this case if I
 

4641
01:29:44,219 --> 01:29:46,189
opportunity to work on this case if I

so I I can't figure out like which piece
 

4647
01:29:52,139 --> 01:29:53,570
so I I can't figure out like which piece
you take it out without it all crumbling

4648
01:29:53,570 --> 01:29:53,580
you take it out without it all crumbling
