had way more of an impact on my career

506
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:22,720
had way more of an impact on my career
 

507
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,430
had way more of an impact on my career
actually

508
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,440
actually
 

509
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,790
actually
uh than i thought it might you know

510
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
uh than i thought it might you know
 

511
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,230
uh than i thought it might you know
typically i guess if you do philosophy

512
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,240
typically i guess if you do philosophy
 

513
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,830
typically i guess if you do philosophy
you go into a lot of finance so it sort

514
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:29,840
you go into a lot of finance so it sort
 

515
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,909
you go into a lot of finance so it sort
of makes sense but

516
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:31,919
of makes sense but
 

517
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,389
of makes sense but
um there are a number of philosophers i

518
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:34,399
um there are a number of philosophers i
 

519
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,990
um there are a number of philosophers i
really admire

520
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,000
really admire
 

521
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,990
really admire
uh the big one of my favorites would be

522
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
uh the big one of my favorites would be
 

523
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,909
uh the big one of my favorites would be
descartes probably the notion of

524
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:39,919
descartes probably the notion of
 

525
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,589
descartes probably the notion of
skepticism

526
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:41,599
skepticism
 

527
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,029
skepticism
it's sort of a rabbit hole it's kind of

528
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:43,039
it's sort of a rabbit hole it's kind of
 

529
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,509
it's sort of a rabbit hole it's kind of
hard to pull yourself out of it

530
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:45,519
hard to pull yourself out of it
 

531
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,030
hard to pull yourself out of it
basically the brain in the vat theory

532
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
basically the brain in the vat theory
 

533
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,870
basically the brain in the vat theory
pulling yourself out of that

534
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:48,880
pulling yourself out of that
 

535
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,750
pulling yourself out of that
but yeah i really like epistemology you

536
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:51,760
but yeah i really like epistemology you
 

537
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,190
but yeah i really like epistemology you
know questioning what it is to have

538
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,200
know questioning what it is to have
 

539
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,710
know questioning what it is to have
knowledge

540
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
knowledge
 

541
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,110
knowledge
um so descartes was was one of my

542
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,120
um so descartes was was one of my
 

543
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,870
um so descartes was was one of my
gateways to that

544
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:58,880
gateways to that
 

545
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,030
gateways to that
do you think everything is noble like we

546
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,040
do you think everything is noble like we
 

547
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,790
do you think everything is noble like we
humans can

548
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:02,800
humans can
 

549
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,990
humans can
can know fully the objective reality oh

550
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,000
can know fully the objective reality oh
 

551
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,110
can know fully the objective reality oh
definitely not

552
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
definitely not
 

553
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,910
definitely not
no i mean i reality is very much

554
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:09,920
no i mean i reality is very much
 

555
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,350
no i mean i reality is very much
processed through your own

556
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
processed through your own
 

557
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,630
processed through your own
you know subjective lens so

558
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:14,640
you know subjective lens so
 

559
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,030
you know subjective lens so
how much do you think do we understand

560
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,040
how much do you think do we understand
 

561
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,550
how much do you think do we understand
about this world

562
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560
about this world
 

563
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,389
about this world
because a lot of your ideas a lot of

564
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:20,399
because a lot of your ideas a lot of
 

565
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,630
because a lot of your ideas a lot of
things we might talk about today

566
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:22,640
things we might talk about today
 

567
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,230
things we might talk about today
are kind of trying to figure out human

568
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,240
are kind of trying to figure out human
 

569
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,670
are kind of trying to figure out human
civilization how

570
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:25,680
civilization how
 

571
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,949
civilization how
humans how human behavior works at scale

572
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:28,959
humans how human behavior works at scale
 

573
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,269
humans how human behavior works at scale
all those kinds of things that kind of

574
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:31,279
all those kinds of things that kind of
 

575
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,870
all those kinds of things that kind of
assumes that we have it

576
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:32,880
assumes that we have it
 

577
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,910
assumes that we have it
or we're able to somehow figure most of

578
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:35,920
or we're able to somehow figure most of
 

579
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,550
or we're able to somehow figure most of
it out

580
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,560
it out
 

581
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,509
it out
right so in your sort of when you step

582
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:39,519
right so in your sort of when you step
 

583
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,949
right so in your sort of when you step
way back

584
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:40,959
way back
 

585
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,550
way back
how much of it have we really figured

586
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:42,560
how much of it have we really figured
 

587
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,030
how much of it have we really figured
out well i think that's the conceit of

588
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,040
out well i think that's the conceit of
 

589
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,389
out well i think that's the conceit of
economics is

590
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:46,399
economics is
 

591
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,990
economics is
thinking that you can model human

592
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,000
thinking that you can model human
 

593
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,310
thinking that you can model human
behavior right in these unbelievably

594
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:50,320
behavior right in these unbelievably
 

595
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,389
behavior right in these unbelievably
complex systems

596
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:52,399
complex systems
 

597
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,829
complex systems
and then i think that's the modern

598
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:53,839
and then i think that's the modern
 

599
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,750
and then i think that's the modern
critique of economics like the sort of

600
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
critique of economics like the sort of
 

601
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,509
critique of economics like the sort of
tilapian critique

602
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:57,519
tilapian critique
 

603
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,910
tilapian critique
is that you can't have true knowledge

604
00:09:59,910 --> 00:09:59,920
is that you can't have true knowledge
 

605
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,870
is that you can't have true knowledge
and they're much

606
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:00,880
and they're much
 

607
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,350
and they're much
less predictable than we think they are

608
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,360
less predictable than we think they are
 

609
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,430
less predictable than we think they are
and you know we behave

610
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:05,440
and you know we behave
 

611
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,670
and you know we behave
according to our accumulated assumptions

612
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680
according to our accumulated assumptions
 

613
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,190
according to our accumulated assumptions
and we're using tiny sort of

614
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,200
and we're using tiny sort of
 

615
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,030
and we're using tiny sort of
data sets trained on the last fifty

616
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,040
data sets trained on the last fifty
 

617
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,470
data sets trained on the last fifty
hundred years

618
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:12,480
hundred years
 

619
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,190
hundred years
and they turn out to be horribly askew

620
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,200
and they turn out to be horribly askew
 

621
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,949
and they turn out to be horribly askew
and that's when we have our grace wands

622
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:16,959
and that's when we have our grace wands
 

623
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,710
and that's when we have our grace wands
and our black swans

624
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:18,720
and our black swans
 

625
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,630
and our black swans
uh so i'm i'm much more on the sort of

626
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,640
uh so i'm i'm much more on the sort of
 

627
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,310
uh so i'm i'm much more on the sort of
you know reality is much less notable

628
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:24,320
you know reality is much less notable
 

629
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,710
you know reality is much less notable
than we think side of things

630
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:26,720
than we think side of things
 

631
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,310
than we think side of things
but it is nice to have very concrete

632
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,320
but it is nice to have very concrete
 

633
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,069
but it is nice to have very concrete
things like bitcoin that's for sure

634
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,079
things like bitcoin that's for sure
 

635
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,790
things like bitcoin that's for sure
oh so you think so most of it is shaky

636
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:32,800
oh so you think so most of it is shaky
 

637
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,310
oh so you think so most of it is shaky
ground but there are some things there's

638
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:34,320
ground but there are some things there's
 

639
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,870
ground but there are some things there's
like islands of sturdiness

640
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:36,880
like islands of sturdiness
 

641
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,790
like islands of sturdiness
yeah bitcoin is one of them that's

642
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:38,800
yeah bitcoin is one of them that's
 

643
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,790
yeah bitcoin is one of them that's
that's a good way to put it yeah i mean

644
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:40,800
that's a good way to put it yeah i mean
 

645
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,310
that's a good way to put it yeah i mean
like look at the dollar system not to

646
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,320
like look at the dollar system not to
 

647
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,069
like look at the dollar system not to
pivot this into the dollar right away

648
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:44,079
pivot this into the dollar right away
 

649
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,430
pivot this into the dollar right away
but

650
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:45,440
but
 

651
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,470
but
the dollar is like shaky ground

652
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:48,480
the dollar is like shaky ground
 

653
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,550
the dollar is like shaky ground
who truly understands the dollar system

654
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:50,560
who truly understands the dollar system
 

655
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,630
who truly understands the dollar system
i mean the totality of it the euro

656
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:52,640
i mean the totality of it the euro
 

657
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,389
i mean the totality of it the euro
dollar system

658
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
dollar system
 

659
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,630
dollar system
the way that monetary policy interacts

660
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,640
the way that monetary policy interacts
 

661
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,310
the way that monetary policy interacts
with the economy

662
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
with the economy
 

663
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,350
with the economy
is monetary issuance inflationary

664
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,360
is monetary issuance inflationary
 

665
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,550
is monetary issuance inflationary
what's the relationship between

666
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:02,560
what's the relationship between
 

667
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,550
what's the relationship between
unemployment and inflation

668
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
unemployment and inflation
 

669
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,389
unemployment and inflation
even policymakers don't understand these

00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,160
tremendous amount of control over
 

839
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,590
tremendous amount of control over
society

840
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:53,600
society
 

841
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,670
society
and i think they have this notion that

842
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:55,680
and i think they have this notion that
 

843
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,629
and i think they have this notion that
you can tinker

844
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:56,639
you can tinker
 

845
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,870
you can tinker
society you can play with a few key

846
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:58,880
society you can play with a few key
 

847
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,710
society you can play with a few key
variables and tinker society

848
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:00,720
variables and tinker society
 

849
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,310
variables and tinker society
into a state that is desirable or good

850
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:04,320
into a state that is desirable or good
 

851
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,710
into a state that is desirable or good
and that's what they're trying to do and

852
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:06,720
and that's what they're trying to do and
 

853
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,389
and that's what they're trying to do and
i think the consequences of that can be

854
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:08,399
i think the consequences of that can be
 

855
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,590
i think the consequences of that can be
pretty bad

856
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:09,600
pretty bad
 

857
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,509
pretty bad
but no i don't think it's born out of

858
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:11,519
but no i don't think it's born out of
 

859
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,030
but no i don't think it's born out of
malevolence

860
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,040
malevolence
 

861
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,269
malevolence
there's an interesting idea i think

862
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:15,279
there's an interesting idea i think
 

863
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,389
there's an interesting idea i think
michael malus brought

864
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
michael malus brought
 

865
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,470
michael malus brought
up as a test whether you're on the left

866
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:18,480
up as a test whether you're on the left
 

867
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,670
up as a test whether you're on the left
or the right

868
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:21,680

 

869
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,829

the question he asks which is do you

870
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:23,839
the question he asks which is do you
 

871
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,509
the question he asks which is do you
think some people are better than

872
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:25,519
think some people are better than
 

873
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,710
think some people are better than
others if you say

874
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:28,720
others if you say
 

875
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,910
others if you say
yes he claims you're on the right if you

876
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:31,920
yes he claims you're on the right if you
 

877
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,310
yes he claims you're on the right if you
start

878
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:32,320
start
 

879
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,949
start
answering if you start like saying a lot

880
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:34,959
answering if you start like saying a lot
 

881
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,030
answering if you start like saying a lot
of things

882
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,040
of things
 

883
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,310
of things
like uh uh you're on the left

884
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:40,320
like uh uh you're on the left
 

885
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,470
like uh uh you're on the left
so if you start explaining yourself well

886
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:42,480
so if you start explaining yourself well
 

887
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,430
so if you start explaining yourself well
okay

888
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:43,440
okay
 

889
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,910
okay
yeah it's a good term for it i was

890
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:45,920
yeah it's a good term for it i was
 

891
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,629
yeah it's a good term for it i was
really

892
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:46,639
really
 

893
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,910
really
so in this in this test i suppose

894
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
so in this in this test i suppose
 

895
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,590
so in this in this test i suppose
i would be on the left because i'm

896
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:51,600
i would be on the left because i'm
 

897
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,670
i would be on the left because i'm
uncomfortable with the idea

898
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:53,680
uncomfortable with the idea
 

899
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,590
uncomfortable with the idea
that some people are better than others

900
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:55,600
that some people are better than others
 

901
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,110
that some people are better than others
as a basic

902
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,120
as a basic
 

903
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,430
as a basic
feeling as a starting point in the way

904
00:14:59,430 --> 00:14:59,440
feeling as a starting point in the way
 

905
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,670
feeling as a starting point in the way
you think about the world because

906
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:01,680
you think about the world because
 

907
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,829
you think about the world because
as we're talking about everybody's a

908
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:03,839
as we're talking about everybody's a
 

909
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,990
as we're talking about everybody's a
hero of their own story

910
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,000
hero of their own story
 

911
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,750
hero of their own story
when you start to think some people are

912
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:07,760
when you start to think some people are
 

913
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,829
when you start to think some people are
better than others

914
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:09,839
better than others
 

915
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,870
better than others
as a starting axiom

916
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:12,880
as a starting axiom
 

917
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,069
as a starting axiom
it's like a slippery slope to where

918
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:16,079
it's like a slippery slope to where
 

919
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,870
it's like a slippery slope to where
you think you're way better than others

920
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:20,880
you think you're way better than others
 

921
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,189
you think you're way better than others
and then you start to like basically

922
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:23,199
and then you start to like basically
 

923
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,430
and then you start to like basically
it's okay to

924
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:25,440
it's okay to
 

925
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,110
it's okay to
take advantage of a large percent of the

926
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
take advantage of a large percent of the
 

927
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,470
take advantage of a large percent of the
population

928
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:28,480
population
 

929
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,550
population
for the greater good totally and then

930
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:30,560
for the greater good totally and then
 

931
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,470
for the greater good totally and then
you go into stalin mode

932
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:32,480
you go into stalin mode
 

933
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,030
you go into stalin mode
in hitler mode where it's okay to murder

934
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,040
in hitler mode where it's okay to murder
 

935
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,910
in hitler mode where it's okay to murder
a larger part

936
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:35,920
a larger part
 

937
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,710
a larger part
of the population for the greater good

938
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:38,720
of the population for the greater good
 

939
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,990
of the population for the greater good
so it's like it's this

940
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,000
so it's like it's this
 

941
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,069
so it's like it's this
very dangerous slippery slope in my mind

942
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:42,079
very dangerous slippery slope in my mind
 

943
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,189
very dangerous slippery slope in my mind
so i tried to

944
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:43,199
so i tried to
 

945
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,910
so i tried to
not uh i was always uncomfortable with

946
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:45,920
not uh i was always uncomfortable with
 

947
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,710
not uh i was always uncomfortable with
that kind of test

948
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:46,720
that kind of test
 

949
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,470
that kind of test
or even that kind of thought and yes the

950
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:48,480
or even that kind of thought and yes the
 

951
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,310
or even that kind of thought and yes the
same applies and suppose

952
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:50,320
same applies and suppose
 

953
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,069
same applies and suppose
in in government in central banking is

954
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:54,079
in in government in central banking is
 

955
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,470
in in government in central banking is
if you think some people are better than

956
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:56,480
if you think some people are better than
 

957
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,269
if you think some people are better than
others

958
00:15:57,269 --> 00:15:57,279
others
 

959
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,550
others
applying your idea what is good can have

960
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:00,560
applying your idea what is good can have
 

961
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,670
applying your idea what is good can have
large-scale detrimental effects

962
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:03,680
large-scale detrimental effects
 

963
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,990
large-scale detrimental effects
of course yeah i i'm glad you didn't

964
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,000
of course yeah i i'm glad you didn't
 

965
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,389
of course yeah i i'm glad you didn't
pose me the question

966
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
pose me the question
 

967
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,949
pose me the question
i mean i think it maybe not the left

968
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:10,959
i mean i think it maybe not the left
 

969
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,629
i mean i think it maybe not the left
right axiom isn't

970
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:12,639
right axiom isn't
 

971
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,189
right axiom isn't
uh the disjunction isn't the way i would

972
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:15,199
uh the disjunction isn't the way i would
 

973
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,150
uh the disjunction isn't the way i would
sort of

974
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,160
sort of
 

975
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,990
sort of
put it but um you know to me it's just

976
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,000
put it but um you know to me it's just
 

977
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,710
put it but um you know to me it's just
if you reason in a consequentialist way

978
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:22,720
if you reason in a consequentialist way
 

979
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,069
if you reason in a consequentialist way
you know that lends itself to

980
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:24,079
you know that lends itself to
 

981
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,509
you know that lends itself to
authoritarianism

982
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:25,519
authoritarianism
 

983
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,670
authoritarianism
yeah where whereby you think you can

984
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:27,680
yeah where whereby you think you can
 

985
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,910
yeah where whereby you think you can
shape society and only you can shape

986
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:29,920
shape society and only you can shape
 

987
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,910
shape society and only you can shape
society in a positive direction

988
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:31,920
society in a positive direction
 

989
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,829
society in a positive direction
according to your you know specific

990
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:34,839
according to your you know specific
 

991
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:36,230
according to your you know specific
objectives

992
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:36,240
objectives
 

993
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,069
objectives
so let's step onto the land of

994
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:38,079
so let's step onto the land of
 

995
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,550
so let's step onto the land of
sturdiness that is bitcoin

996
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:40,560
sturdiness that is bitcoin
 

997
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,230
sturdiness that is bitcoin
what is bitcoin and um in your view what

998
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:44,240
what is bitcoin and um in your view what
 

999
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,110
what is bitcoin and um in your view what
are

1000
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,120
are
 

1001
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,629
are
you know the principles the

1002
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:46,639
you know the principles the
 

1003
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,430
you know the principles the
philosophical foundations of bitcoin

1004
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:49,440
philosophical foundations of bitcoin
 

1005
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,790
philosophical foundations of bitcoin
well bitcoin the term i think refers to

1006
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:52,800
well bitcoin the term i think refers to
 

1007
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,470
well bitcoin the term i think refers to
two things specifically

1008
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:54,480
two things specifically
 

1009
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,829
two things specifically
so one is the protocol for conveying

1010
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:57,839
so one is the protocol for conveying
 

1011
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,310
so one is the protocol for conveying
value through communications channel

1012
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:00,320
value through communications channel
 

1013
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,749
value through communications channel
so just a set of rules that we

1014
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:01,759
so just a set of rules that we
 

1015
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,150
so just a set of rules that we
collectively opt into

1016
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:04,160
collectively opt into
 

1017
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,590
collectively opt into
in order to transact online or just add

1018
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:07,600
in order to transact online or just add
 

1019
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,870
in order to transact online or just add
a distance

1020
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:08,880
a distance
 

1021
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,510
a distance
and then the other thing is the name of

1022
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:11,520
and then the other thing is the name of
 

1023
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,150
and then the other thing is the name of
the

1024
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:12,160
the
 

1025
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,949
the
asset the sort of monetary unit which

1026
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:14,959
asset the sort of monetary unit which
 

1027
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:15,750
asset the sort of monetary unit which
circulates

1028
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:15,760
circulates
 

1029
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,069
circulates
within the system and that always

1030
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:18,079
within the system and that always
 

1031
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,669
within the system and that always
confuse people a lot because it's like

1032
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:19,679
confuse people a lot because it's like
 

1033
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,110
confuse people a lot because it's like
well you've got uppercase bitcoin

1034
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:21,120
well you've got uppercase bitcoin
 

1035
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,789
well you've got uppercase bitcoin
lowercase bitcoin

1036
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:22,799
lowercase bitcoin
 

1037
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,309
lowercase bitcoin
why didn't satoshi just give them

1038
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:24,319
why didn't satoshi just give them
 

1039
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,789
why didn't satoshi just give them
different names like in ethereum you've

1040
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:26,799
different names like in ethereum you've
 

1041
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:27,909
different names like in ethereum you've
got ethereum

1042
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:27,919
got ethereum
 

1043
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,310
got ethereum
the system and then ether although

1044
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:30,320
the system and then ether although
 

1045
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,590
the system and then ether although
people don't really talk about ether

1046
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:31,600
people don't really talk about ether
 

1047
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,110
people don't really talk about ether
very much but

1048
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,120
very much but
 

1049
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,230
very much but
they you know chose to distinguish them

1050
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,240
they you know chose to distinguish them
 

1051
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,630
they you know chose to distinguish them
in bitcoin for whatever reason they're

1052
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:38,640
in bitcoin for whatever reason they're
 

1053
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,070
in bitcoin for whatever reason they're
not distinct

1054
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
not distinct
 

1055
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,470
not distinct
uh so the two bitcoins get co-mingled

1056
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:42,480
uh so the two bitcoins get co-mingled
 

1057
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,190
uh so the two bitcoins get co-mingled
all the time

1058
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:43,200
all the time
 

1059
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,909
all the time
in the explanations did you find that's

1060
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:45,919
in the explanations did you find that's
 

1061
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,590
in the explanations did you find that's
a problem that confuses things

1062
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:47,600
a problem that confuses things
 

1063
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,870
a problem that confuses things
i mean what's what's really a

1064
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:48,880
i mean what's what's really a
 

1065
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,549
i mean what's what's really a
distinction between the protocol and the

1066
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:50,559
distinction between the protocol and the
 

1067
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,430
distinction between the protocol and the
currency

1068
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:51,440
currency
 

1069
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,230
currency
well they are sometimes uh distinguished

1070
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:54,240
well they are sometimes uh distinguished
 

1071
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,110
well they are sometimes uh distinguished
practically

1072
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,120
practically
 

1073
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,350
practically
like you can transact with bitcoin

1074
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:57,360
like you can transact with bitcoin
 

1075
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,029
like you can transact with bitcoin
outside of the bitcoin protocol for

1076
00:17:59,029 --> 00:17:59,039
outside of the bitcoin protocol for
 

1077
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,470
outside of the bitcoin protocol for
instance right

1078
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:00,480
instance right
 

1079
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,190
instance right
uh so you know you can transact with

1080
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,200
uh so you know you can transact with
 

1081
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,310
uh so you know you can transact with
bitcoin on

1082
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:04,320
bitcoin on
 

1083
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,510
bitcoin on
ethereum or i have bitcoin on an open

1084
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:07,520
ethereum or i have bitcoin on an open
 

1085
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,630
ethereum or i have bitcoin on an open
dime here

1086
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:08,640
dime here
 

1087
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,230
dime here
this would be a bitcoin transaction it

1088
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:10,240
this would be a bitcoin transaction it
 

1089
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,070
this would be a bitcoin transaction it
wouldn't settle on the bitcoin network

1090
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,080
wouldn't settle on the bitcoin network
 

1091
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,510
wouldn't settle on the bitcoin network
do you mind explaining what you have on

1092
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:13,520
do you mind explaining what you have on
 

1093
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,830
do you mind explaining what you have on
the table before us yeah so i brought

1094
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:15,840
the table before us yeah so i brought
 

1095
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,150
the table before us yeah so i brought
you

1096
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:16,160
you
 

1097
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,350
you
some presents this is awesome this isn't

1098
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:19,360
some presents this is awesome this isn't
 

1099
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,270
some presents this is awesome this isn't
a bribe this is just a proof of concept

1100
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:21,280
a bribe this is just a proof of concept
 

1101
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,950
a bribe this is just a proof of concept
okay so this is basically

1102
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:22,960
okay so this is basically
 

1103
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,549
okay so this is basically
um a bitcoin bearer

1104
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:26,559
um a bitcoin bearer
 

1105
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,830
um a bitcoin bearer
instrument so i put 100 bucks of bitcoin

1106
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:29,840
instrument so i put 100 bucks of bitcoin
 

1107
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,950
instrument so i put 100 bucks of bitcoin
on here

1108
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:30,960
on here
 

1109
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,110
on here
and to spend it you have to basically

1110
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,120
and to spend it you have to basically
 

1111
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,310
and to spend it you have to basically
physically destroy

1112
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:34,320
physically destroy
 

1113
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,590
physically destroy
part of the device you have to poke a

1114
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:35,600
part of the device you have to poke a
 

1115
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,310
part of the device you have to poke a
hole and um you know poke off one of the

1116
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:38,320
hole and um you know poke off one of the
 

1117
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,230
hole and um you know poke off one of the
little transistors on this

1118
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:40,240
little transistors on this
 

1119
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,350
little transistors on this
so it can only be spent once uh

1120
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,360
so it can only be spent once uh
 

1121
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,830
so it can only be spent once uh
so and you can't extract the private key

1122
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:45,840
so and you can't extract the private key
 

1123
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,270
so and you can't extract the private key
from this device

1124
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,280
from this device
 

1125
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,630
from this device
so the private key was generated on

1126
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:48,640
so the private key was generated on
 

1127
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,789
so the private key was generated on
device always stays on the device

1128
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:50,799
device always stays on the device
 

1129
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,830
device always stays on the device
so what it means without uh

1130
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:53,840
so what it means without uh
 

1131
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,110
so what it means without uh
like breaking off like a small part so

1132
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,120
like breaking off like a small part so
 

1133
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,630
like breaking off like a small part so
this basically is a way to physically

1134
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:00,640
this basically is a way to physically
 

1135
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,630
this basically is a way to physically
instantiate bitcoin

1136
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:02,640
instantiate bitcoin
 

1137
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,750
instantiate bitcoin
so it's um it's kind of

1138
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:05,760
so it's um it's kind of
 

1139
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,029
so it's um it's kind of
cold yeah effectively so here thank you

1140
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:09,039
cold yeah effectively so here thank you
 

1141
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,789
cold yeah effectively so here thank you
so much this one's limited edition it's

1142
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:10,799
so much this one's limited edition it's
 

1143
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,029
so much this one's limited edition it's
orange

1144
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:13,039
orange
 

1145
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,750
orange
so what is it called again open dime the

1146
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:15,760
so what is it called again open dime the
 

1147
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,470
so what is it called again open dime the
point is

1148
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:16,480
point is
 

1149
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,990
point is
if you wanted to settle a bitcoin

1150
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,000
if you wanted to settle a bitcoin
 

1151
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,510
if you wanted to settle a bitcoin
transaction instantly

1152
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:19,520
transaction instantly
 

1153
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,510
transaction instantly
the kind of same way that a cash

1154
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:21,520
the kind of same way that a cash
 

1155
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,590
the kind of same way that a cash
transaction is instant final settlement

1156
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:23,600
transaction is instant final settlement
 

1157
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,789
transaction is instant final settlement
right you would do it with a device like

1158
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:26,799
right you would do it with a device like
 

1159
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,430
right you would do it with a device like
this so

1160
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:27,440
this so
 

1161
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,150
this so
if i was buying a house from you you

1162
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:30,160
if i was buying a house from you you
 

1163
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,430
if i was buying a house from you you
know

1164
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:31,440
know
 

1165
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,950
know
you might prefer to do it with a

1166
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:32,960
you might prefer to do it with a
 

1167
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,950
you might prefer to do it with a
physical bearer instrument

1168
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:34,960
physical bearer instrument
 

1169
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,350
physical bearer instrument
as opposed to waiting for a confirmation

1170
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:37,360
as opposed to waiting for a confirmation
 

1171
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:37,990
as opposed to waiting for a confirmation
on the bitcoin

1172
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,000
on the bitcoin
 

1173
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,870
on the bitcoin
blockchain so the moment i hand that

1174
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:40,880
blockchain so the moment i hand that
 

1175
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,830
blockchain so the moment i hand that
over to you

1176
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:41,840
over to you
 

1177
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,390
over to you
goes in your possession you're the owner

1178
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:44,400
goes in your possession you're the owner
 

1179
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,230
goes in your possession you're the owner
there's no way for me to have retained

1180
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:46,240
there's no way for me to have retained
 

1181
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,430
there's no way for me to have retained
the private key like

1182
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:47,440
the private key like
 

1183
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,110
the private key like
i could have created a bitcoin paper

1184
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:49,120
i could have created a bitcoin paper
 

1185
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,110
i could have created a bitcoin paper
wallet and given that to you but

1186
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,120
wallet and given that to you but
 

1187
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,029
wallet and given that to you but
you have no assurance that i didn't copy

1188
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:53,039
you have no assurance that i didn't copy
 

1189
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,750
you have no assurance that i didn't copy
down that you know the key elsewhere

1190
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:55,760
down that you know the key elsewhere
 

1191
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,669
down that you know the key elsewhere
so this solves that problem so this is a

1192
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:57,679
so this solves that problem so this is a
 

1193
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,110
so this solves that problem so this is a
physical instantiation

1194
00:19:59,110 --> 00:19:59,120
physical instantiation
 

1195
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,390
physical instantiation
of the the bitcoin uh

1196
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:02,400
of the the bitcoin uh
 

1197
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,789
of the the bitcoin uh
transaction outside the bitcoin protocol

1198
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:04,799
transaction outside the bitcoin protocol
 

1199
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:05,510
transaction outside the bitcoin protocol
that's right

1200
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:05,520
that's right
 

1201
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,190
that's right
this is you're transacting the currency

1202
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,200
this is you're transacting the currency
 

1203
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,950
this is you're transacting the currency
outside of the protocol so it's analog

1204
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:08,960
outside of the protocol so it's analog
 

1205
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,990
outside of the protocol so it's analog
bitcoin we're

1206
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,000
bitcoin we're
 

1207
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,710
bitcoin we're
we're running an analog which i always

1208
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:12,720
we're running an analog which i always
 

1209
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,549
we're running an analog which i always
like because bitcoin is this immaterial

1210
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:14,559
like because bitcoin is this immaterial
 

1211
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,270
like because bitcoin is this immaterial
thing

1212
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,280
thing
 

1213
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,070
thing
and so it's nice to have physical totems

1214
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:18,080
and so it's nice to have physical totems
 

1215
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,909
and so it's nice to have physical totems
how much does it cost to manufacture

1216
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:19,919
how much does it cost to manufacture
 

1217
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:20,230
how much does it cost to manufacture
this

1218
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:20,240
this
 

1219
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,350
this
you know like 15 bucks or something

1220
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:23,360
you know like 15 bucks or something
 

1221
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,510
you know like 15 bucks or something
is it so this is just kind of a almost

1222
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:25,520
is it so this is just kind of a almost
 

1223
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,110
is it so this is just kind of a almost
like a philosophical statement

1224
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,120
like a philosophical statement
 

1225
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,350
like a philosophical statement
versus um something that's scalable for

1226
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:31,360
versus um something that's scalable for
 

1227
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,909
versus um something that's scalable for
for use like you know the point of

1228
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:33,919
for use like you know the point of
 

1229
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,669
for use like you know the point of
bitcoin is to be in the digital space

1230
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:35,679
bitcoin is to be in the digital space
 

1231
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:36,470
bitcoin is to be in the digital space
right but

1232
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:36,480
right but
 

1233
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,029
right but
this shows like bitcoin can be anywhere

1234
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:39,039
this shows like bitcoin can be anywhere
 

1235
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,510
this shows like bitcoin can be anywhere
it's useful for gifts but yeah i mean

1236
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:41,520
it's useful for gifts but yeah i mean
 

1237
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,070
it's useful for gifts but yeah i mean
i don't know if it would be a suitable

1238
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,080
i don't know if it would be a suitable
 

1239
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,430
i don't know if it would be a suitable
foundation for a physical

1240
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:45,440
foundation for a physical
 

1241
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,830
foundation for a physical
bitcoin economy in theory these would be

1242
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:47,840
bitcoin economy in theory these would be
 

1243
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,270
bitcoin economy in theory these would be
like cash-like instruments that you

1244
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:49,280
like cash-like instruments that you
 

1245
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,470
like cash-like instruments that you
could use to transact

1246
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:50,480
could use to transact
 

1247
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,630
could use to transact
well i just mean post-apocalypse yeah

1248
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:52,640
well i just mean post-apocalypse yeah
 

1249
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,750
well i just mean post-apocalypse yeah
yeah but

1250
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:53,760
yeah but
 

1251
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,830
yeah but
you still need you still need to plug it

1252
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:55,840
you still need you still need to plug it
 

1253
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,149
you still need you still need to plug it
into your laptop to actually verify

1254
00:20:58,149 --> 00:20:58,159
into your laptop to actually verify
 

1255
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,029
into your laptop to actually verify
that there's coins on there so you still

1256
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:01,039
that there's coins on there so you still
 

1257
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,950
that there's coins on there so you still
need the internet

1258
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:02,960
need the internet
 

1259
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,270
need the internet
so i have to take your uh word for how

1260
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:05,280
so i have to take your uh word for how
 

1261
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,390
so i have to take your uh word for how
much money is on here

1262
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:06,400
much money is on here
 

1263
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,590
much money is on here
no i mean you can you can plug it in

1264
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:09,600
no i mean you can you can plug it in
 

1265
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,230
no i mean you can you can plug it in
and check yeah but to transact to

1266
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:12,240
and check yeah but to transact to
 

1267
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,270
and check yeah but to transact to
extract

1268
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:13,280
extract
 

1269
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,590
extract
bitcoin from this i need to break yeah

1270
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:15,600
bitcoin from this i need to break yeah
 

1271
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,830
bitcoin from this i need to break yeah
you have to poke a hole through the

1272
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:17,840
you have to poke a hole through the
 

1273
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,909
you have to poke a hole through the
the little hole and that renders it

1274
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:19,919
the little hole and that renders it
 

1275
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,590
the little hole and that renders it
spendable exactly

1276
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:21,600
spendable exactly
 

1277
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,630
spendable exactly
so you know that's protection again so

1278
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:24,640
so you know that's protection again so
 

1279
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,470
so you know that's protection again so
you spending it and then representing

1280
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:26,480
you spending it and then representing
 

1281
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,830
you spending it and then representing
that it's still loaded that's

1282
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:27,840
that it's still loaded that's
 

1283
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,789
that it's still loaded that's
fascinating

1284
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:28,799
fascinating
 

1285
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,789
fascinating
cool yeah so that the other thing i

1286
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:30,799
cool yeah so that the other thing i
 

1287
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,870
cool yeah so that the other thing i
brought you're basically dice

1288
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:32,880
brought you're basically dice
 

1289
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,950
brought you're basically dice
uh 12-sided they don't have any bitcoin

1290
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:36,960
uh 12-sided they don't have any bitcoin
 

1291
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,669
uh 12-sided they don't have any bitcoin
on them

1292
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:37,679
on them
 

1293
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,669
on them
so they just have a bunch of different

1294
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:39,679
so they just have a bunch of different
 

1295
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,270
so they just have a bunch of different
critiques of bitcoin on each side

1296
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:43,280
critiques of bitcoin on each side
 

1297
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,270
critiques of bitcoin on each side
uh we'll go through them then this is

1298
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:45,280
uh we'll go through them then this is
 

1299
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,029
uh we'll go through them then this is
awesome i i don't know if we have time

1300
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:47,039
awesome i i don't know if we have time
 

1301
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,230
awesome i i don't know if we have time
to do all 11

1302
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:48,240
to do all 11
 

1303
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,390
to do all 11
because there's one with my funds logo

1304
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:50,400
because there's one with my funds logo
 

1305
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,669
because there's one with my funds logo
on it but um

1306
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:51,679
on it but um
 

1307
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,669
on it but um
it's just basically a tongue-in-cheek

1308
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:53,679
it's just basically a tongue-in-cheek
 

1309
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:54,710
it's just basically a tongue-in-cheek
joke that

1310
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:54,720
joke that
 

1311
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,870
joke that
the critiques of bitcoin are so formalic

1312
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:56,880
the critiques of bitcoin are so formalic
 

1313
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,549
the critiques of bitcoin are so formalic
at this point that you can just put them

1314
00:21:58,549 --> 00:21:58,559
at this point that you can just put them
 

1315
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,430
at this point that you can just put them
on dice

1316
00:21:59,430 --> 00:21:59,440
on dice
 

1317
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,789
on dice
yeah um it's it's silly

1318
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:02,799
yeah um it's it's silly
 

1319
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,590
yeah um it's it's silly
well some of them might be topics for

1320
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:05,600
well some of them might be topics for
 

1321
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,789
well some of them might be topics for
interesting conversations

1322
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:06,799
interesting conversations
 

1323
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,029
interesting conversations
oh yeah we can even arrange the

1324
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:09,039
oh yeah we can even arrange the
 

1325
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,549
oh yeah we can even arrange the
conversation that way you can roll the

1326
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:10,559

1340
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:24,640
seems to be like you said
 

1341
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,669
seems to be like you said
uh it seems like sturdy ground so what

1342
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:27,679
uh it seems like sturdy ground so what
 

1343
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,310
uh it seems like sturdy ground so what
do you mean by

1344
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:28,320
do you mean by
 

1345
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,789
do you mean by
yeah yeah so it's not just any protocol

1346
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:30,799
yeah yeah so it's not just any protocol
 

1347
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,390
yeah yeah so it's not just any protocol

non-discretionary monetary policy
 

1415
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,390
non-discretionary monetary policy
so algorithmic monetary policy as

so algorithmic monetary policy as

satoshi felt leads to credit bubbles and
so on

00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:00,320
so on
 

1435
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,190
so on
so bitcoin proposes a completely

none of those numbers really matter
 

1453

none of those numbers really matter

like it could have been 25 million units

but what matters is that this schedule

00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:29,760
but what matters is that this schedule
 

1461
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,870
but what matters is that this schedule
was proposed

1462
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:30,880
was proposed
 

1463
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,990
was proposed
even before the code was public the

00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:34,000
even before the code was public the

even before the code was public the

schedule was proposed
 

1467
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,590
schedule was proposed
and then we all collectively agreed to

1468
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:37,600
and then we all collectively agreed to
 

1469
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,190
and then we all collectively agreed to
stick to it

1470
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:39,200
stick to it
 

1471
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,590
stick to it
and that is kind of a first for monetary

1472
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:41,600
and that is kind of a first for monetary
 

1473
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,029
and that is kind of a first for monetary

i mean gold kind of has that property

1476
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:45,360
i mean gold kind of has that property
 

1477
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,310
i mean gold kind of has that property
right because

1478
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:46,320
right because

so it's it's sort of inhuman which is a

1486
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:53,360
so it's it's sort of inhuman which is a
 

1487
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,870
so it's it's sort of inhuman which is a
good feature right you don't want to

1488
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:54,880
good feature right you don't want to
 

1489
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,269
good feature right you don't want to
give humans that much control over it

00:24:57,269 --> 00:24:57,279
give humans that much control over it
 

1491
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,710
give humans that much control over it
bitcoin is a much more

1492
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:00,720
bitcoin is a much more
 

1493
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,789
bitcoin is a much more
you know fastidious approach to that it

1494
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:02,799
you know fastidious approach to that it
 

1495
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,750
you know fastidious approach to that it
really is super concrete about what the

1496
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:05,760
really is super concrete about what the
 

1497
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,990
really is super concrete about what the
supply schedule is and the fact

1498
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,000
supply schedule is and the fact
 

1499
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,830
supply schedule is and the fact
crucially that it can't change

1500
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:09,840
crucially that it can't change
 

1501
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,789
crucially that it can't change
so we can't have a bailout of debt

1502
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:12,799
so we can't have a bailout of debt
 

1503
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:13,909
so we can't have a bailout of debt
debtors

debtors
 

1505
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,269

a lot of people would say a lot of

1506
00:25:15,269 --> 00:25:15,279
a lot of people would say a lot of
 

1507
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,830
a lot of people would say a lot of
people had debts denominated in bitcoin

1508
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:17,840
people had debts denominated in bitcoin
 

1509
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,870
people had debts denominated in bitcoin
and we needed loose

1510
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:18,880
and we needed loose
 

1511
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,950
and we needed loose
accommodative monetary policy to bail

1512
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:20,960
accommodative monetary policy to bail
 

1513
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,909
accommodative monetary policy to bail
them out that's not possible we couldn't

1514
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:23,919
them out that's not possible we couldn't
 

1515
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,310
them out that's not possible we couldn't
have a jubilee denominated in bitcoin

1516
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:26,320
have a jubilee denominated in bitcoin
 

1517
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,830
have a jubilee denominated in bitcoin
because the social contract

1518
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:27,840
because the social contract
 

1519
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,310
because the social contract
we've all you know bought into and

1520
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:30,320
we've all you know bought into and
 

1521
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,990
we've all you know bought into and
committed to

1522
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,000
committed to
 

1523
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,470
committed to
is that it's not just non-discretionary

1524
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:34,480
is that it's not just non-discretionary
 

1525
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,990
is that it's not just non-discretionary
so that's sort of one of the first

1526
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,000
so that's sort of one of the first
 

1527
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,110
so that's sort of one of the first
things

1528
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:37,120
things
 

1529
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,510
things
um and i think ultimately that comes

1530
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:39,520
um and i think ultimately that comes
 

1531
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,310
um and i think ultimately that comes
back to

1532
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:40,320
back to
 

1533
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,630
back to
basically a strong respect for property

1534
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:42,640
basically a strong respect for property

because if we were to have unanticipated

1538
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:46,640
because if we were to have unanticipated

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,669
because if we were to have unanticipated
inflation let's say

00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:47,679
inflation let's say

you know really charismatic leader

1542
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:49,360
you know really charismatic leader
 

1543
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,430
you know really charismatic leader
somehow commandeered bitcoin and

1544
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:51,440
somehow commandeered bitcoin and
 

1545
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,789
somehow commandeered bitcoin and
convinced everyone that we should have

1546
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:52,799
convinced everyone that we should have
 

1547
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,070
convinced everyone that we should have
30 million units and not 21 million

1548

30 million units and not 21 million
 

1549
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,230
30 million units and not 21 million
that would basically be dilutive on

00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:58,240
that would basically be dilutive on
 

1551
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,269
that would basically be dilutive on
everybody that

everybody that
 

1553
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,310
everybody that
held bitcoin and had opted into the

1554
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:02,320
held bitcoin and had opted into the
 

1555
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,590
held bitcoin and had opted into the

an additional 9 million unanticipated
 

1559
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,430
an additional 9 million unanticipated
would have a dilutive effect on everyone

would have a dilutive effect on everyone
 

1561
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,149
would have a dilutive effect on everyone
else

and that would be a covert way of

and that would be a covert way of
 

1565
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,430
and that would be a covert way of
effectively stealing their purchasing

kind of thing i mean uh

00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:17,360
kind of thing i mean uh
 

1573
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,190
kind of thing i mean uh
what what's the mechanism of bitcoin

1574
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:19,200
what what's the mechanism of bitcoin
 

1575
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,190
what what's the mechanism of bitcoin
that resists that kind of charismatic

1576
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:21,200
that resists that kind of charismatic

well we've had people that have had

00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:25,360
well we've had people that have had
 

1581
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,870
well we've had people that have had
a lot of influence in bitcoin in the

1582
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:26,880
a lot of influence in bitcoin in the
 

1583
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,190
a lot of influence in bitcoin in the
past and they've tried to make changes

past and they've tried to make changes
 

1585

to the protocol not as

to the protocol not as
 

1587
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,909
to the protocol not as
dramatic as that but bitcoiners

1588
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:33,919
dramatic as that but bitcoiners
 

1589
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,390
dramatic as that but bitcoiners
have generally resisted those

1590
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:36,400
have generally resisted those
 

1591
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,269
have generally resisted those
individuals

bitcoiners have a good track record of
 

1597
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,950
bitcoiners have a good track record of
sort of staying true to

sort of staying true to
 

1599
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,269
sort of staying true to
to those core values so that you know

1600
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:45,279
to those core values so that you know
 

1601
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,390
to those core values so that you know
the you mentioned

1602
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:46,400
the you mentioned
 

1603
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,269
the you mentioned
values and and like sticking to the

1604
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:49,279
values and and like sticking to the
 

1605
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,630
values and and like sticking to the
monetary thing

monetary thing
 

1607
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,669
monetary thing
but there's bigger values uh

1608
00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:53,679
but there's bigger values uh
 

1609
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,669
but there's bigger values uh
there's almost like psychological values

1610
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:55,679
there's almost like psychological values
 

1611
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,510
there's almost like psychological values
that are instilled in bitcoin uh you

1612
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:57,520
that are instilled in bitcoin uh you
 

1613
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,310
that are instilled in bitcoin uh you
make a point

1614
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:58,320
make a point
 

1615
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,669
make a point
that bitcoin for many is a vessel quote

1616
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:01,679
that bitcoin for many is a vessel quote
 

1617
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,269
that bitcoin for many is a vessel quote
for their expectations hopes and dreams

for their expectations hopes and dreams
 

1619
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,190
for their expectations hopes and dreams
uh can uh the bitcoin protocol support

1620
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:09,200
uh can uh the bitcoin protocol support
 

1621
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,710
uh can uh the bitcoin protocol support
this kind of complexity of

1622
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:10,720
this kind of complexity of
 

1623
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,990
this kind of complexity of
the human condition so like there's

1624
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:14,000
the human condition so like there's
 

1625
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,750
the human condition so like there's
ideas of freedom

1626
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:15,760
ideas of freedom
 

1627
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,470
ideas of freedom
that seem to be spoken about there's a

1628
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:18,480
that seem to be spoken about there's a
 

1629
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,669
that seem to be spoken about there's a
sort of ideas of um

1630
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:21,679
sort of ideas of um
 

1631
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,029

00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:26,720
some people kind of use it as a meme
 

1635
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,950
some people kind of use it as a meme
like you know bitcoin is love or

1636
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:28,960
like you know bitcoin is love or
 

1637
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,750
like you know bitcoin is love or
something like that

1638
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:29,760
something like that
 

1639
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,630
something like that
you know mostly to troll me because i

1640
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:32,640
you know mostly to troll me because i
 

1641
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,070
you know mostly to troll me because i
talk about love all the time

1642

talk about love all the time
 

1643
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,789
talk about love all the time
but you know these bigger ideas than

1644
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:36,799
but you know these bigger ideas than
 

1645
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,149
but you know these bigger ideas than
just

1646
00:27:38,149 --> 00:27:38,159
just
 

1647
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,830
just
the exchange of currencies yeah i mean

1648
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:41,840
the exchange of currencies yeah i mean
 

1649
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,029
the exchange of currencies yeah i mean
bitcoin itself is very uh simple i would

1650
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:45,039
bitcoin itself is very uh simple i would
 

1651
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,870
bitcoin itself is very uh simple i would
say like ultimately

1652
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:46,880
say like ultimately
 

1653
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,070
say like ultimately
it doesn't you know pretend to do very

1654
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,080
it doesn't you know pretend to do very
 

1655
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,870
it doesn't you know pretend to do very
much it really just settles transactions

1656
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:52,880
much it really just settles transactions
 

1657
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,630
much it really just settles transactions
um but people do superimpose their own

1658
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:56,640
um but people do superimpose their own
 

1659
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,230
um but people do superimpose their own
views on it for sure um and bitcoin's

1660
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:00,240
views on it for sure um and bitcoin's
 

1661
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,070
views on it for sure um and bitcoin's
qualities give rise

1662
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,080
qualities give rise
 

1663
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,029
qualities give rise
to these perceptions of it having

1664
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:05,039
to these perceptions of it having
 

1665
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,389
to these perceptions of it having
censorship resistance

1666
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:06,399
censorship resistance
 

1667
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,510
censorship resistance
or giving you transactional freedom or a

1668
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:09,520
or giving you transactional freedom or a
 

1669
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,149
or giving you transactional freedom or a
measure of transactional privacy

1670
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:12,159
measure of transactional privacy
 

1671
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,750
measure of transactional privacy
so because anyone can

1672
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:15,760
so because anyone can
 

1673
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,830
so because anyone can
operate a node and join the consensus

1674
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:17,840
operate a node and join the consensus
 

1675
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,350
operate a node and join the consensus
process and because mining is a

1676
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:19,360
process and because mining is a
 

1677
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,149
process and because mining is a
competitive free market process

1678
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:22,159
competitive free market process
 

1679
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,669
competitive free market process
that means that it's likely that

1680
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:25,679
that means that it's likely that
 

1681
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,310
that means that it's likely that
you can't be censored by the miners so

1682
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:28,320
you can't be censored by the miners so
 

1683
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,510
you can't be censored by the miners so
that means you have transactional

1684
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:29,520
that means you have transactional
 

1685
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,029
that means you have transactional
freedom so you have these

1686
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:31,039
freedom so you have these
 

1687
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,510
freedom so you have these
computer science technical features of

1688
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:33,520
computer science technical features of
 

1689
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,269
computer science technical features of
the system that cause it to have these

1690
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:35,279
the system that cause it to have these
 

1691
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,669
the system that cause it to have these
political qualities which is

1692
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:37,679
political qualities which is
 

1693
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,310
political qualities which is
it's very hard or impossible to censor a

1694
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:40,320
it's very hard or impossible to censor a
 

1695
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,549
it's very hard or impossible to censor a
specific individual

1696
00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:42,559
specific individual
 

1697
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,430
specific individual
so it's it's interesting to see that

1698
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:45,440
so it's it's interesting to see that
 

1699
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,389
so it's it's interesting to see that
flow

1700
00:28:46,389 --> 00:28:46,399
flow
 

1701
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,389
flow
but so that's one of the core values for

1702
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:48,399
but so that's one of the core values for
 

1703
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,950
but so that's one of the core values for
sure is the censorship resistance

1704
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:50,960
sure is the censorship resistance
 

1705
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,549
sure is the censorship resistance
then you have the fact that it's a

1706
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:52,559
then you have the fact that it's a
 

1707
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,269
then you have the fact that it's a
cryptographic based system

1708
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:55,279
cryptographic based system
 

1709
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,190
cryptographic based system
and uh you can hold value in your brain

1710
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:57,200
and uh you can hold value in your brain
 

1711
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,230
and uh you can hold value in your brain
by memorizing 12 words for instance

1712
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:00,240
by memorizing 12 words for instance
 

1713
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,789
by memorizing 12 words for instance
that gives it seizure resistance which

1714
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:02,799
that gives it seizure resistance which
 

1715
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,710
that gives it seizure resistance which
is again a political concept if you

1716
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:04,720
is again a political concept if you
 

1717
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,149
is again a political concept if you
wanted to

1718
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:06,159
wanted to
 

1719
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,549
wanted to
desert your jurisdiction with your

1720
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:08,559
desert your jurisdiction with your
 

1721
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,110
desert your jurisdiction with your
wealth intact in your brain

1722
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:11,120
wealth intact in your brain
 

1723
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,669
wealth intact in your brain
you know that you know cryptographic

1724
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:13,679
you know that you know cryptographic
 

1725
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,269
you know that you know cryptographic
feature of the system the fact that it's

1726
00:29:15,269 --> 00:29:15,279
feature of the system the fact that it's
 

1727
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,350
feature of the system the fact that it's
built on public key cryptography

1728
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:17,360
built on public key cryptography
 

1729
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,590
built on public key cryptography
and that you can encode a bitcoin

1730
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:19,600
and that you can encode a bitcoin
 

1731
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,710
and that you can encode a bitcoin
private key

1732
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:20,720
private key
 

1733
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,990
private key
in 12 words that gives it this political

1734
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,000
in 12 words that gives it this political
 

1735
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,110
in 12 words that gives it this political
salience

1736
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:25,120
salience
 

1737
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,350
salience
that you know you can you're now

1738
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:27,360
that you know you can you're now
 

1739
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,149
that you know you can you're now
empowered

1740
00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:28,159
empowered
 

1741
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,110
empowered
relative to a despot basically yeah i

1742
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,120
relative to a despot basically yeah i
 

1743
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,510
relative to a despot basically yeah i
mean

1744
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:31,520
mean
 

1745
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,909
mean
there's so many beautiful concepts

1746
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:33,919
there's so many beautiful concepts
 

1747
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:34,549
there's so many beautiful concepts
behind

1748
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:34,559
behind
 

1749
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,070
behind
cryptocurrency behind bitcoin that

1750
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,080
cryptocurrency behind bitcoin that
 

1751
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,310
cryptocurrency behind bitcoin that
stand for sort of freedom some of the

1752
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:40,320
stand for sort of freedom some of the
 

1753
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,830
stand for sort of freedom some of the
basic things that the founding of this

1754
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:41,840
basic things that the founding of this
 

1755
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,630
basic things that the founding of this
country

1756
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:42,640
country
 

1757
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,269
country
the one thing i don't like personally

1758
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:45,279
the one thing i don't like personally
 

1759
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,149
the one thing i don't like personally
behind

1760
00:29:46,149 --> 00:29:46,159
behind
 

1761
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,710
behind
uh bitcoin and cryptocurrency is that

1762
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:48,720
uh bitcoin and cryptocurrency is that
 

1763
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,070
uh bitcoin and cryptocurrency is that
money's involved

1764
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:50,080
money's involved
 

1765
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,990
money's involved
and it's like people's life savings

1766
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,000
and it's like people's life savings
 

1767
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,669
and it's like people's life savings
sometimes are involved

1768
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:53,679
sometimes are involved
 

1769
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,190
sometimes are involved
so there is naturally a kind of

1770
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:57,200
so there is naturally a kind of
 

1771
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,230
so there is naturally a kind of
fear a self-preservation

1772
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:00,240
fear a self-preservation
 

1773
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,510
fear a self-preservation
uh like instinctual kind of dogmatic

1774
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:03,520
uh like instinctual kind of dogmatic
 

1775
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,269
uh like instinctual kind of dogmatic
thing that comes in

1776
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:05,279
thing that comes in
 

1777
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,590
thing that comes in
where you're not the best of human

1778
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:07,600
where you're not the best of human
 

1779
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,590
where you're not the best of human
nature you're you stop being a george

1780
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:09,600
nature you're you stop being a george
 

1781
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,630
nature you're you stop being a george
washington

1782
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:10,640
washington
 

1783
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,269
washington
and you lose touch of the like

1784
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:13,279
and you lose touch of the like
 

1785
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,029
and you lose touch of the like
foundational principles which i think

1786
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:15,039
foundational principles which i think
 

1787
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,549
foundational principles which i think
are beautiful just like the founding

1788
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:16,559
are beautiful just like the founding
 

1789
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,070
are beautiful just like the founding
principles of this country

1790
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,080
principles of this country
 

1791
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,110
principles of this country
so that's that's just like um so i like

1792
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:21,120
so that's that's just like um so i like
 

1793
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:21,990
so that's that's just like um so i like
staying on the

1794
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,000
staying on the
 

1795
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,190
staying on the
level of like the philosophy versus the

1796
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,200
level of like the philosophy versus the
 

1797
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,549
level of like the philosophy versus the
level of like all my money is invested

1798
00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:28,559
level of like all my money is invested
 

1799
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,430
level of like all my money is invested
in bitcoin

1800
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:29,440
in bitcoin
 

1801
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,230
in bitcoin
and that that becomes very tricky

1802
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:32,240
and that that becomes very tricky
 

1803
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,149
and that that becomes very tricky
territory to have

1804
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:34,159
territory to have
 

1805
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,990
territory to have
principal discussions yeah about ideas

1806
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:38,000
principal discussions yeah about ideas
 

1807
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,830
principal discussions yeah about ideas
well it's an interesting intention i try

1808
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:39,840
well it's an interesting intention i try
 

1809
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,830
well it's an interesting intention i try
to stay balanced despite being very

1810
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:41,840
to stay balanced despite being very
 

1811
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,149
to stay balanced despite being very
exposed to bitcoin so

1812
00:30:44,149 --> 00:30:44,159
exposed to bitcoin so
 

1813
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,710
exposed to bitcoin so
let me ask the ridiculous question just

1814
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:46,720
let me ask the ridiculous question just
 

1815
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,350
let me ask the ridiculous question just
in case

1816
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:47,360
in case
 

1817
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,389
in case
who's satoshi is it you

1818
00:30:50,389 --> 00:30:50,399
who's satoshi is it you
 

1819
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,389
who's satoshi is it you
we don't know it's probably not me

1820
00:30:52,389 --> 00:30:52,399
we don't know it's probably not me
 

1821
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,269
we don't know it's probably not me
because i was

1822
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:55,279
because i was
 

1823
00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:00,310
because i was
um like 17 when satoshi mounted bitcoin

1824
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:00,320
um like 17 when satoshi mounted bitcoin
 

1825
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,990
um like 17 when satoshi mounted bitcoin
16. so unlikely and also i'm not really

1826
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:04,000
16. so unlikely and also i'm not really
 

1827
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,110
16. so unlikely and also i'm not really
a programmer so um

1828
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:07,120
a programmer so um
 

1829
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,630
a programmer so um
there's a lot of theories but honestly

1830
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:08,640
there's a lot of theories but honestly
 

1831
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,909
there's a lot of theories but honestly
it's one of the greatest mysteries of

1832
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:09,919
it's one of the greatest mysteries of
 

1833
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:10,950
it's one of the greatest mysteries of
all time because

1834
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:10,960
all time because
 

1835
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,590
all time because
even bitcoins that have been around

1836
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:13,600
even bitcoins that have been around
 

1837
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,070
even bitcoins that have been around
since

1838
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:14,080
since
 

1839
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,430
since
day one really you know people that were

1840
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:17,440
day one really you know people that were
 

1841
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:17,990
day one really you know people that were
around

1842
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:18,000
around
 

1843
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,750
around
before bitcoin came out they're on the

1844
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:19,760
before bitcoin came out they're on the
 

1845
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,029
before bitcoin came out they're on the
mailing list they were active in the

1846
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:21,039
mailing list they were active in the
 

1847
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,950
mailing list they were active in the
cypherpunk community

1848
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:22,960
cypherpunk community
 

1849
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,789
cypherpunk community
you asked someone they sincerely will

1850
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:24,799
you asked someone they sincerely will
 

1851
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,950
you asked someone they sincerely will
not know and they may not even have a

1852
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:26,960
not know and they may not even have a
 

1853
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,750
not know and they may not even have a
good guess

1854
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:27,760
good guess
 

1855
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,070
good guess
as to who satoshi is is it important to

1856
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,080
as to who satoshi is is it important to
 

1857
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,909
as to who satoshi is is it important to
know or is it like actually important

1858
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:31,919
know or is it like actually important
 

1859
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:32,870
know or is it like actually important
not to know

1860
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:32,880
not to know
 

1861
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,470
not to know
do you think that's a feature or bug

1862
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:34,480
do you think that's a feature or bug
 

1863
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,909
do you think that's a feature or bug
that you we don't know

1864
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:35,919
that you we don't know
 

1865
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,669
that you we don't know
some people don't like the uncertainty

1866
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:37,679
some people don't like the uncertainty
 

1867
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,149
some people don't like the uncertainty
especially you know folks on wall street

1868
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:40,159
especially you know folks on wall street
 

1869
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,149
especially you know folks on wall street
they really want to know

1870
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:42,159
they really want to know
 

1871
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,909
they really want to know
and uh if you read the coinbase s1 their

1872
00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:45,919
and uh if you read the coinbase s1 their
 

1873
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,710
and uh if you read the coinbase s1 their
disclosure pre-ipo that's a risk factor

1874
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:48,720
disclosure pre-ipo that's a risk factor
 

1875
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,950
disclosure pre-ipo that's a risk factor
that satoshi could come back

1876
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:50,960
that satoshi could come back
 

1877
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,990
that satoshi could come back
so the the risk management crowd wants

1878
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:54,000
so the the risk management crowd wants
 

1879
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,950
so the the risk management crowd wants
to know

1880
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:54,960
to know
 

1881
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,630
to know
because they want to know if maybe

1882
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:56,640
because they want to know if maybe
 

1883
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,630
because they want to know if maybe
satoshi had you know

1884
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:58,640
satoshi had you know
 

1885
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,389
satoshi had you know
undesirable political opinions or

1886
00:32:00,389 --> 00:32:00,399
undesirable political opinions or
 

1887
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,149
undesirable political opinions or
something that would forever taint the

1888
00:32:02,149 --> 00:32:02,159
something that would forever taint the
 

1889
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:02,789
something that would forever taint the
project

1890
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:02,799
project
 

1891
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:03,990
project
do you think they were just trolling

1892
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,000
do you think they were just trolling
 

1893
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,070
do you think they were just trolling
with that risk with the

1894
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:06,080
with that risk with the
 

1895
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,669
with that risk with the
satoshi's identity being a risk factor

1896
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:09,679
satoshi's identity being a risk factor
 

1897
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,029
satoshi's identity being a risk factor
or is that like actual

1898
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:11,039
or is that like actual
 

1899
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,789
or is that like actual
like was there an actual meeting and a

1900
00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:12,799
like was there an actual meeting and a
 

1901
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,950
like was there an actual meeting and a
discussion of that being a risk factor

1902
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:14,960
discussion of that being a risk factor
 

1903
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,789
discussion of that being a risk factor
i think in the risk factor sections of

1904
00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:16,799
i think in the risk factor sections of
 

1905
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,549
i think in the risk factor sections of
the prospectuses it's really just the

1906
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:18,559
the prospectuses it's really just the
 

1907
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,310
the prospectuses it's really just the
lawyers doing a total brain dump to

1908
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:20,320
lawyers doing a total brain dump to
 

1909
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,750
lawyers doing a total brain dump to
cover absolutely everything they can

1910
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:21,760
cover absolutely everything they can
 

1911
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,590
cover absolutely everything they can
think of so it's just lawyers it's not

1912
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:23,600
think of so it's just lawyers it's not
 

1913
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,870
think of so it's just lawyers it's not
like

1914
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:24,880
like
 

1915
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,310
like
uh you know it's like i think elon was

1916
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:28,320
uh you know it's like i think elon was
 

1917
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,830
uh you know it's like i think elon was
somewhere in the legal documents where

1918
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:29,840
somewhere in the legal documents where
 

1919
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,430
somewhere in the legal documents where
spacex

1920
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:31,440
spacex
 

1921
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,470
spacex
mentioned that like uh earth governments

1922
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:34,480
mentioned that like uh earth governments
 

1923
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,470
mentioned that like uh earth governments
have no jurisdiction on mars

1924
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:36,480
have no jurisdiction on mars
 

1925
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,310
have no jurisdiction on mars
like they threw that in there and it

1926
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:38,320
like they threw that in there and it
 

1927
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,149
like they threw that in there and it
feels like yeah that could be lawyers

1928
00:32:40,149 --> 00:32:40,159
feels like yeah that could be lawyers
 

1929
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,310
feels like yeah that could be lawyers
but it could also just be elon trolling

1930
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:42,320
but it could also just be elon trolling
 

1931
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,990
but it could also just be elon trolling
yeah so i wonder if it's like the

1932
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:44,000
yeah so i wonder if it's like the
 

1933
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,070
yeah so i wonder if it's like the
coinbase folks trolling

1934
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:46,080
coinbase folks trolling
 

1935
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,110
coinbase folks trolling
or if uh i don't know if it's lawyers i

1936
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:49,120
or if uh i don't know if it's lawyers i
 

1937
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,110
or if uh i don't know if it's lawyers i
hope it's the trolling not the lawyers

1938
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:51,120
hope it's the trolling not the lawyers
 

1939
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,350
hope it's the trolling not the lawyers
the the coinbase leadership they're not

1940
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:53,360
the the coinbase leadership they're not
 

1941
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,310
the the coinbase leadership they're not
as big uh

1942
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:54,320
as big uh
 

1943
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,190
as big uh
trolls as elon is but uh i mean it's a

1944
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:57,200
trolls as elon is but uh i mean it's a
 

1945
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,870
trolls as elon is but uh i mean it's a
it's a risk for sure from their

1946
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:58,880
it's a risk for sure from their
 

1947
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,549
it's a risk for sure from their
perspective because

1948
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:00,559
perspective because
 

1949
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,710
perspective because
let's say satoshi returned doesn't seem

1950
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:02,720
let's say satoshi returned doesn't seem
 

1951
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,310
let's say satoshi returned doesn't seem
likely and let's say they decided to

1952
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:04,320
likely and let's say they decided to
 

1953
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,750
likely and let's say they decided to
spend all their coins

1954
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:05,760
spend all their coins
 

1955
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,950
spend all their coins
which also seems very unlikely um that's

1956
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:08,960
which also seems very unlikely um that's
 

1957
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,990
which also seems very unlikely um that's
you know

1958
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:10,000
you know
 

1959
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,950
you know
rumored to be or estimates have it at 1

1960
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:12,960
rumored to be or estimates have it at 1
 

1961
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,950
rumored to be or estimates have it at 1
to 1.2 million

1962
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:14,960
to 1.2 million
 

1963
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,870
to 1.2 million
bitcoin which is like 50 60 billion

1964
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:18,880
bitcoin which is like 50 60 billion
 

1965
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,789
bitcoin which is like 50 60 billion
dollars worth

1966
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:20,799
dollars worth
 

1967
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,950
dollars worth
so some people consider that to be a

1968
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:22,960
so some people consider that to be a
 

1969
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,630
so some people consider that to be a
risk you think it's

1970
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:24,640
risk you think it's
 

1971
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,029
risk you think it's
uh you know this is almost like a topic

1972
00:33:27,029 --> 00:33:27,039
uh you know this is almost like a topic
 

1973
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,549
uh you know this is almost like a topic
of leadership

1974
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:28,559
of leadership
 

1975
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,789
of leadership
it doesn't feel like anybody any one

is there interesting things you could

2158
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:38,480
is there interesting things you could
 

2159
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,310
is there interesting things you could
say like what are minors

2160
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:40,320
say like what are minors

what's proof of work is there uh a nice

2166
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:46,720
what's proof of work is there uh a nice
 

2167
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,750
what's proof of work is there uh a nice
way to wrap up

2168
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:47,760
way to wrap up
 

2169
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,790
way to wrap up
a clean explanation of the protocol oh

2170
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:50,800
a clean explanation of the protocol oh
 

2171
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,190
a clean explanation of the protocol oh
man

2172
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:51,200
man
 

2173
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,950
man
that's uh that could be a whole that

2174
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:52,960
that's uh that could be a whole that
 

2175
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,510
that's uh that could be a whole that
could be another five hours

2176
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:55,520
could be another five hours
 

2177
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,109
could be another five hours
is there interesting because i'd love to

2178
00:36:57,109 --> 00:36:57,119
is there interesting because i'd love to
 

2179
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,950
is there interesting because i'd love to
talk to you about block size wars and

2180
00:36:58,950 --> 00:36:58,960
talk to you about block size wars and
 

2181
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,750
talk to you about block size wars and
sort of the

2182
00:36:59,750 --> 00:36:59,760
sort of the
 

2183
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,150
sort of the
the the politics psychology the

2184
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:02,160
the the politics psychology the
 

2185
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,750
the the politics psychology the
principles around that but sort of

2186
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:03,760
principles around that but sort of
 

2187
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,349
principles around that but sort of
building up to that it'd be nice to talk

2188
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:05,359
building up to that it'd be nice to talk
 

2189
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,109
building up to that it'd be nice to talk
about how the thing works

2190
00:37:07,109 --> 00:37:07,119
about how the thing works
 

2191
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,870
about how the thing works
that's fair i mean and the block size

2192
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:08,880
that's fair i mean and the block size
 

2193
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,349
that's fair i mean and the block size
wars are really fascinating

2194
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:11,359
wars are really fascinating
 

2195
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,630
wars are really fascinating
discussion of how governance debates

2196
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:14,640
discussion of how governance debates
 

2197
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,750
discussion of how governance debates
intersect with technical features um

2198
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:17,760
intersect with technical features um
 

2199
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,750
intersect with technical features um
so i guess we can yeah so basically

2200
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:21,760
so i guess we can yeah so basically
 

2201
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,310
so i guess we can yeah so basically
at the highest possible level bitcoin is

2202
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:24,320
at the highest possible level bitcoin is
 

2203
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,030
at the highest possible level bitcoin is

a
 

2205
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,230
a
globally shared uh it's really a

2206
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:28,240
globally shared uh it's really a
 

2207
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,390
globally shared uh it's really a
replicated ledger that

2208
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:30,400
replicated ledger that
 

2209
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,710
replicated ledger that
um any participant that wants to be an

2210
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:32,720
um any participant that wants to be an
 

2211
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,710
um any participant that wants to be an
equal peer on that ledger

2212
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:34,720
equal peer on that ledger
 

2213
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,430
equal peer on that ledger
they want to maintain that ledger and

2214
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:37,440
they want to maintain that ledger and
 

2215
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,950
they want to maintain that ledger and
they want to stay up to date with the

2216
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:38,960
they want to stay up to date with the
 

2217
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,990
they want to stay up to date with the
global state

2218
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:40,000
global state
 

2219
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,670
global state
of the ledger and really any monetary

2220
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:43,680
of the ledger and really any monetary
 

2221
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,630
of the ledger and really any monetary
system is just

2222
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:44,640
system is just
 

2223
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,470
system is just
a ledger with physical cash

2224
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:48,480
a ledger with physical cash
 

2225
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,069
a ledger with physical cash
we benefit from the physical

2226
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:50,079
we benefit from the physical

00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:53,920
of the money so the physics is the
 

2231
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,069
of the money so the physics is the

2232
00:37:56,069 --> 00:37:56,079
ledger the physics is a ledger right
 

2233
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,670
ledger the physics is a ledger right
same with gold right you can't just

2234
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:57,680
same with gold right you can't just
 

2235
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,510
same with gold right you can't just
produce new units of gold

2236
00:37:59,510 --> 00:37:59,520
produce new units of gold
 

2237
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,510
produce new units of gold
so we trust that gold atoms are hard to

2238
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:03,520
so we trust that gold atoms are hard to
 

2239
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,550
so we trust that gold atoms are hard to
create

2240
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:04,560
create
 

2241
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,589
create
um although not impossible right um you

2242
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:07,599
um although not impossible right um you
 

2243
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:08,230
um although not impossible right um you
could uh

2244
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:08,240
could uh
 

2245
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,430
could uh
fire a bunch of protons and whatever is

2246
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:11,440
fire a bunch of protons and whatever is
 

2247
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,990
fire a bunch of protons and whatever is
the adjacent metal uh and create gold

2248
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:14,000
the adjacent metal uh and create gold
 

2249
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,670
the adjacent metal uh and create gold
atoms would be expensive

2250
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:15,680
atoms would be expensive
 

2251
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,670
atoms would be expensive
uh and the same with dollars you know we

2252
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:17,680
uh and the same with dollars you know we
 

2253
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,950
uh and the same with dollars you know we
trust that it's hard to counterfeit a

2254
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:18,960
trust that it's hard to counterfeit a
 

2255
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,589
trust that it's hard to counterfeit a
dollar

2256

dollar
 

2257
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,790
dollar
so we trust the physical analog world to

2258
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:22,800
so we trust the physical analog world to
 

2259
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,710
so we trust the physical analog world to
help maintain the state of that ledger

2260
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:24,720
help maintain the state of that ledger
 

2261
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,230
help maintain the state of that ledger
with digital money

2262
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:26,240
with digital money
 

2263
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,630
with digital money
like um you know the money in your bank

2264
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:28,640
like um you know the money in your bank
 

2265
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,430
like um you know the money in your bank
account

your checking account we basically trust
 

2269
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,550
your checking account we basically trust
our institutions or banking institutions

00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:36,640
to keep a faithful record
 

2273
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,150
to keep a faithful record
and then ultimately we trust the central

2274
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:38,160
and then ultimately we trust the central
 

2275
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,030
and then ultimately we trust the central
bank to administer that system

2276
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,040
bank to administer that system
 

2277
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,349
bank to administer that system
so there's kind of a handful of nodes in

2278
00:38:43,349 --> 00:38:43,359
so there's kind of a handful of nodes in
 

2279
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,190
so there's kind of a handful of nodes in
bitcoin we trust that the economic

2280
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:45,200
bitcoin we trust that the economic
 

2281
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,710
bitcoin we trust that the economic

incentives of the system
 

2283
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,310
incentives of the system
are carefully poised basically so

2284
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:50,320
are carefully poised basically so
 

2285
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,550
are carefully poised basically so
we trust that the free market mining

2286
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:52,560
we trust that the free market mining
 

2287
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,750
we trust that the free market mining
competition

2288
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:53,760
competition
 

2289
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,150
competition
will lead to the miners assembling

2290
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:56,160
will lead to the miners assembling
 

2291
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:56,950
will lead to the miners assembling

00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:08,950
which updates every 10 minutes or so
with some variants

2304
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:08,960
with some variants
 

2305
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,589
with some variants
and then the miners aren't the sole

2306
00:39:11,589 --> 00:39:11,599
and then the miners aren't the sole
 

2307
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,069
and then the miners aren't the sole
entities that control the system to

2308
00:39:14,069 --> 00:39:14,079
entities that control the system to
 

2309
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:14,710
entities that control the system to
really

2310
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:14,720
really
 

2311
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,710
really
participate if you're a merchant and

2312
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:16,720
participate if you're a merchant and
 

2313
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,069
participate if you're a merchant and
you're accepting bitcoin

2314
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:18,079
you're accepting bitcoin
 

2315
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,589
you're accepting bitcoin
you really want to run your own full

2316
00:39:19,589 --> 00:39:19,599
you really want to run your own full
 

2317
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,670
you really want to run your own full
node and check the whole history of

2318
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:21,680
node and check the whole history of
 

2319
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,470
node and check the whole history of
transactions

2320
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:22,480
transactions
 

2321
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,109
transactions
sort of something like when i say five

2322
00:39:25,109 --> 00:39:25,119
sort of something like when i say five
 

2323
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,950
sort of something like when i say five
to 600 million transactions that have

2324
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:26,960
to 600 million transactions that have
 

2325
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,470
to 600 million transactions that have
ever occurred on bitcoin

2326
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:28,480
ever occurred on bitcoin
 

2327
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,230
ever occurred on bitcoin
so full node contains all the

2328
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:30,240
so full node contains all the
 

2329
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,870
so full node contains all the
transactions ever transacted

2330
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:32,880
transactions ever transacted
 

2331
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,030
transactions ever transacted
on the the bitcoin blockchain and that's

2332
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:37,040
on the the bitcoin blockchain and that's
 

2333
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,950
on the the bitcoin blockchain and that's
i saw it's like 200 gigs or something

2334
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:38,960
i saw it's like 200 gigs or something
 

2335
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,190
i saw it's like 200 gigs or something
like that it's like 350 something like

2336
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:41,200
like that it's like 350 something like
 

2337
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,670
like that it's like 350 something like
that

2338
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:41,680
that
 

2339
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,550
that
it's doable on a regular consumer laptop

2340
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:44,560
it's doable on a regular consumer laptop
 

2341
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,589
it's doable on a regular consumer laptop
and that is going to be

2342
00:39:45,589 --> 00:39:45,599
and that is going to be
 

2343
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,910
and that is going to be
really key later on in the discussion

2344
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:47,920
really key later on in the discussion
 

2345
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,750
really key later on in the discussion
sure

2346
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:49,760
sure
 

2347
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,910
sure
but so you know that's really the

2348
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:51,920
but so you know that's really the
 

2349
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,510
but so you know that's really the
ultimate trust models first of all we

2350
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:53,520
ultimate trust models first of all we
 

2351
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,950
ultimate trust models first of all we
trust that the miners that assemble

2352
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:54,960
trust that the miners that assemble
 

2353
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,030
trust that the miners that assemble
transactions into blocks and

2354
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:57,040
transactions into blocks and
 

2355
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,109
transactions into blocks and
they are the archivists you know they

2356
00:39:59,109 --> 00:39:59,119
they are the archivists you know they
 

2357
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,030
they are the archivists you know they
inscribe those transactions onto the

2358
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:01,040
inscribe those transactions onto the
 

2359
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,990
inscribe those transactions onto the
ledger

2360
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:02,000
ledger
 

2361
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,309
ledger
and they have an economic incentive to

2362
00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:04,319
and they have an economic incentive to
 

2363
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,829
and they have an economic incentive to
sort of behave correctly because they're

2364
00:40:05,829 --> 00:40:05,839
sort of behave correctly because they're
 

2365
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:06,230
sort of behave correctly because they're
getting

2366
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:06,240
getting
 

2367
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,270
getting
paid and no units of bitcoin that's part

2368
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:09,280
paid and no units of bitcoin that's part
 

2369
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,710
paid and no units of bitcoin that's part
of it but then really

2370
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:10,720
of it but then really
 

2371
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,589
of it but then really
you are also you're not fully trusting

2372
00:40:13,589 --> 00:40:13,599
you are also you're not fully trusting
 

2373
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:13,910
you are also you're not fully trusting
them

2374
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:13,920
them
 

2375
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,109
them
you're actually if you want to run a

2376
00:40:15,109 --> 00:40:15,119
you're actually if you want to run a
 

2377
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,349
you're actually if you want to run a
node you replay every single transaction

2378
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:17,359
node you replay every single transaction
 

2379
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,030
node you replay every single transaction
in the history of bitcoin

2380
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:19,040
in the history of bitcoin
 

2381
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,190
in the history of bitcoin
from the beginning to the current day

2382
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:21,200
from the beginning to the current day
 

2383
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,950
from the beginning to the current day
and you arrive at the present state that

2384
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:22,960
and you arrive at the present state that
 

2385
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,750
and you arrive at the present state that
way

2386
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:23,760
way
 

2387
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,829
way
so you don't really have to trust too

2388
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:25,839
so you don't really have to trust too
 

2389
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,990
so you don't really have to trust too
many people or entities

2390
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:28,000
many people or entities
 

2391
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,030
many people or entities
you can validate the correctness of that

2392
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:31,040
you can validate the correctness of that
 

2393
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,550
you can validate the correctness of that
all the rules have been followed

2394
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:32,560
all the rules have been followed
 

2395
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,990
all the rules have been followed
that all the bitcoins that were created

2396
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:34,000
that all the bitcoins that were created
 

2397
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,910
that all the bitcoins that were created
were done so in the valid

2398
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:35,920
were done so in the valid
 

2399
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,790
were done so in the valid
way that the inflation rate was adhered

2400
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:38,800
way that the inflation rate was adhered
 

2401
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,510
way that the inflation rate was adhered
to

2402
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:39,520
to
 

2403
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,990
to
and that there's no covert inflation you

2404
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:42,000
and that there's no covert inflation you
 

2405
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,109
and that there's no covert inflation you
know that

2406
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:43,119
know that
 

2407
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,750
know that
if you're spending 50 units of bitcoin

2408
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:45,760
if you're spending 50 units of bitcoin
 

2409
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,470
if you're spending 50 units of bitcoin
uh you had that bitcoin to spend

2410
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:48,480
uh you had that bitcoin to spend
 

2411
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,510
uh you had that bitcoin to spend
in the first place uh so it's sort of

2412
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:51,520
in the first place uh so it's sort of
 

2413
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,390
in the first place uh so it's sort of
delicately poised between node operators

2414
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:54,400
delicately poised between node operators
 

2415
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,950
delicately poised between node operators
who who you know engage in this validity

2416
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:56,960
who who you know engage in this validity
 

2417
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,750
who who you know engage in this validity
checking

2418
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:57,760
checking
 

2419
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,829
checking
kind of anti-counterfeiting checking and

2420
00:40:59,829 --> 00:40:59,839
kind of anti-counterfeiting checking and
 

2421
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,589
kind of anti-counterfeiting checking and
then also the miners which are an

2422
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:01,599
then also the miners which are an
 

2423
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,190
then also the miners which are an
industrial entity

2424
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:03,200
industrial entity
 

2425
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,990
industrial entity
and they basically produce block space

2426
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:06,000
and they basically produce block space
 

2427
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,630
and they basically produce block space
and

2428
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:06,640
and
 

2429
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,950
and
assemble transactions in the box and

2430
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:08,960
assemble transactions in the box and
 

2431
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,670
assemble transactions in the box and
everybody so the miners are incentivized

2432
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:11,680
everybody so the miners are incentivized
 

2433
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,750
everybody so the miners are incentivized
to not mess with the system because

2434
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:13,760
to not mess with the system because
 

2435
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,349
to not mess with the system because
they're getting value from the system

2436
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:15,359
they're getting value from the system
 

2437
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,550
they're getting value from the system
so if they mess with it it's going to

2438
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:18,560
so if they mess with it it's going to
 

2439
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,910
so if they mess with it it's going to
decrease the value of their physical

2440
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:21,920
decrease the value of their physical
 

2441
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,230
decrease the value of their physical
work investment yeah so they have to

2442
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:24,240
work investment yeah so they have to
 

2443
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,150
work investment yeah so they have to
incur a real physical cost

2444
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:26,160
incur a real physical cost
 

2445
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,550
incur a real physical cost
to produce a block right so right now

2446
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:30,560
to produce a block right so right now
 

2447
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,750
to produce a block right so right now
you get uh 6.25 bitcoins in a block at a

2448
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:33,760
you get uh 6.25 bitcoins in a block at a
 

2449
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,430
you get uh 6.25 bitcoins in a block at a
minimum and then maybe some fees

2450
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:35,440
minimum and then maybe some fees
 

2451
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,750
minimum and then maybe some fees
as well and how hard is it to produce a

2452
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:37,760
as well and how hard is it to produce a
 

2453
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,550
as well and how hard is it to produce a
block now

2454
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:38,560
block now
 

2455
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,990
block now
well challenging i mean you need uh

2456
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:42,000
well challenging i mean you need uh
 

2457
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,069
well challenging i mean you need uh
so six point two five bitcoins and a

2458
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:44,079
so six point two five bitcoins and a
 

2459
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,589
so six point two five bitcoins and a
bitcoin's worth fifty five thousand

2460
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:45,599
bitcoin's worth fifty five thousand
 

2461
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:46,870
bitcoin's worth fifty five thousand
dollars or so

2462
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:46,880
dollars or so
 

2463
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,030
dollars or so
so it's probably going to cost you about

2464
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:49,040
so it's probably going to cost you about
 

2465
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,069
so it's probably going to cost you about
that amount

2466
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:50,079
that amount
 

2467
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,630
that amount
to produce it because it's a free market

2468
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:52,640
to produce it because it's a free market
 

2469
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,589
to produce it because it's a free market
competition

2470
00:41:53,589 --> 00:41:53,599
competition
 

2471
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,550
competition
and miners have very free thin margins

2472
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:56,560
and miners have very free thin margins
 

2473
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,349
and miners have very free thin margins
so

2474
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:57,359
so
 

2475
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,750
so
it's like if i auction off a dollar you

2476
00:41:59,750 --> 00:41:59,760
it's like if i auction off a dollar you
 

2477
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,430
it's like if i auction off a dollar you
would pay up to 99 cents

2478
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:01,440
would pay up to 99 cents
 

2479
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,910
would pay up to 99 cents
to buy that dollar for me it's exactly

2480
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:03,920
to buy that dollar for me it's exactly
 

2481
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,990
to buy that dollar for me it's exactly
what happens with miners

2482
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:06,000
what happens with miners
 

2483
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,270
what happens with miners
they're you know basically competing for

2484
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:09,280
they're you know basically competing for
 

2485
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:09,829
they're you know basically competing for
the right

2486
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:09,839

2487
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,750
the right

that doesn't do almost as well on a
classical computer so it doesn't

2628
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:27,280
classical computer so it doesn't
 

2629
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,309
classical computer so it doesn't
like yes the dream is somehow

2630

uh quantum computers will change the

2632
00:44:33,349 --> 00:44:33,359
uh quantum computers will change the
 

2633
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:34,150
uh quantum computers will change the
nature of

2634
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:34,160
nature of
 

2635
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,470
nature of
artificial intelligence but there's yet

2636
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:36,480
artificial intelligence but there's yet
 

2637
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,470
artificial intelligence but there's yet
to be an actual

2638
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:38,480
to be an actual
 

2639
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,230
to be an actual
algorithm that uh or a problem set or a

data set
where that would be the case so

2644
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:45,760
where that would be the case so
 

2645
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,829
where that would be the case so
skepticism is good in this space

yeah but uh the block size warf i would

2708

yeah but uh the block size warf i would
 

2709
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:54,950
yeah but uh the block size warf i would
say effectively ended

2710

say effectively ended
 

2711
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,870
say effectively ended
um although we're definitely gonna have

2712
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:56,880
um although we're definitely gonna have
 

2713
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,069
um although we're definitely gonna have
more

2714
00:45:58,069 --> 00:45:58,079
more
 

2715
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:01,030
more
civil wars in bitcoin for sure but

2716
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:01,040
civil wars in bitcoin for sure but
 

2717
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,910
civil wars in bitcoin for sure but
basically the core argument was

2718
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:03,920
basically the core argument was
 

2719
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,750
basically the core argument was
a technical one on its surface but a

2720
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:05,760
a technical one on its surface but a
 

2721
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,950
a technical one on its surface but a
very deep

2722
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:06,960
very deep
 

2723
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,670
very deep
political one at its core the technical

2724
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:09,680
political one at its core the technical
 

2725
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,790
political one at its core the technical
question is

2726
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:10,800
question is
 

2727
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,510
question is
how many megabytes should be in each

2728
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:13,520
how many megabytes should be in each
 

2729
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,589
how many megabytes should be in each
successive block

2730
00:46:15,589 --> 00:46:15,599
successive block
 

2731
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,230
successive block
so satoshi basically installed a limit

2732
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:18,240
so satoshi basically installed a limit
 

2733
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,230
so satoshi basically installed a limit
of one megabyte per block

2734
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:20,240
of one megabyte per block
 

2735
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,710
of one megabyte per block
so we should backtrack there was no

2736
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:22,720
so we should backtrack there was no
 

2737
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,430
so we should backtrack there was no
limit

2738
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:23,440
limit
 

2739
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,750
limit
in the beginning and it seems like

2740
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:25,760
in the beginning and it seems like
 

2741
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,630
in the beginning and it seems like
satoshi

2742
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:26,640
satoshi
 

2743
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,349

what 2017 or something like that

what 2017 or something like that
 

2747
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,550
what 2017 or something like that
i don't know when the 15 was when the

2748
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:34,560
i don't know when the 15 was when the
 

2749
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,349
i don't know when the 15 was when the
you know

2750
00:46:35,349 --> 00:46:35,359
you know
 

2751
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,950

in the civil war
 

2755
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,630
in the civil war
i don't remember but sort of satoshi i

00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:42,640
i don't remember but sort of satoshi i
 

2757
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,230

don't know if you can comment it

2758
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:44,240
don't know if you can comment it
 

2759
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,309
don't know if you can comment it
on it like why does satoshi set the

2760
00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:46,319
on it like why does satoshi set the
 

2761
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:47,990
on it like why does satoshi set the
limit to one megabyte

2762
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:48,000
limit to one megabyte
 

2763
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,589
limit to one megabyte
all of a sudden almost secretively

2764
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:51,599
all of a sudden almost secretively
 

2765
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,230
all of a sudden almost secretively
and in the beginning there was no limit

2766
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:54,240
and in the beginning there was no limit
 

2767
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,190
and in the beginning there was no limit
whatsoever

2768
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:55,200
whatsoever
 

2769
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,270
whatsoever
yeah i mean we can get into and people

2770
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:57,280
yeah i mean we can get into and people
 

2771
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,870
yeah i mean we can get into and people
have spent thousands of hours poring

2772
00:46:58,870 --> 00:46:58,880
have spent thousands of hours poring
 

2773
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,190
have spent thousands of hours poring
over satoshi's writings to find

2774
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:01,200
over satoshi's writings to find
 

2775
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,670
over satoshi's writings to find
you know which side satoshi was on and

you know which side satoshi was on and
 

2777
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,950
you know which side satoshi was on and
you can find

2778
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:04,960
you can find
 

2779
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,670
you can find
like any textual exegesis you can find

2780
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:07,680
like any textual exegesis you can find
 

2781

side right but uh yeah i mean
effectively when bitcoin was launched

2786
00:47:13,349 --> 00:47:13,359
effectively when bitcoin was launched
 

2787

effectively when bitcoin was launched
there was a block size because

2788
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:15,200
there was a block size because
 

2789
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,109
there was a block size because
if you made a block over a certain size

2790
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:17,119
if you made a block over a certain size
 

2791
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,109
if you made a block over a certain size
with the first edition of the code

2792
00:47:19,109 --> 00:47:19,119
with the first edition of the code
 

2793
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,309
with the first edition of the code
it would have crashed nodes but then

2794
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:22,319
it would have crashed nodes but then
 

2795
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,069
it would have crashed nodes but then
yeah in 2010 satoshi added the one

2796
00:47:24,069 --> 00:47:24,079
yeah in 2010 satoshi added the one
 

2797
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:25,190
yeah in 2010 satoshi added the one
megabyte limit

2798
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:25,200
megabyte limit
 

2799
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,430
megabyte limit
in a covert way with no comments or

2800
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:27,440
in a covert way with no comments or
 

2801
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,549
in a covert way with no comments or
anything

2802
00:47:28,549 --> 00:47:28,559
anything
 

2803
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:32,470
anything
and uh that's stock basically and uh

2804
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:32,480
and uh that's stock basically and uh
 

2805
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,430
and uh that's stock basically and uh
and then bitcoin blocks filled up and

2806
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:35,440
and then bitcoin blocks filled up and
 

2807
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,109
and then bitcoin blocks filled up and
people that had been socialized into

2808
00:47:37,109 --> 00:47:37,119
people that had been socialized into
 

2809
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,510
people that had been socialized into
this vision of bitcoin as an effectively

2810
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:39,520
this vision of bitcoin as an effectively
 

2811
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,309
this vision of bitcoin as an effectively
free

2812
00:47:40,309 --> 00:47:40,319

2813
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,069

transactional network like why pay a

2814
00:47:42,069 --> 00:47:42,079
transactional network like why pay a
 

2815
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,430
transactional network like why pay a
transaction fee

2816
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:43,440
transaction fee
 

2817
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,829
transaction fee
if you're not at congestion if the block

2818
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:45,839
if you're not at congestion if the block
 

2819
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,270
if you're not at congestion if the block
isn't full the miner will mine your

2820
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:47,280
isn't full the miner will mine your
 

2821
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,510
isn't full the miner will mine your
transaction for free right

2822
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:49,520
transaction for free right
 

2823
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,470
transaction for free right
um people that had been brought up in

2824
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:52,480
um people that had been brought up in
 

2825
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,030
um people that had been brought up in
that

2826
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:53,040
that
 

2827
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:57,829
that
status quo from 2009 to kind of 2015

2828
00:47:57,829 --> 00:47:57,839
status quo from 2009 to kind of 2015
 

2829
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,349
status quo from 2009 to kind of 2015
they noticed the blocks started to fill

2830
00:47:59,349 --> 00:47:59,359
they noticed the blocks started to fill
 

2831
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:00,950
they noticed the blocks started to fill
up and they're like okay well let's just

2832
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:00,960
up and they're like okay well let's just
 

2833
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,630
up and they're like okay well let's just
remove this arbitrary limit

2834
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:02,640
remove this arbitrary limit
 

2835
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,309
remove this arbitrary limit
right what what could possibly be the

2836
00:48:04,309 --> 00:48:04,319
right what what could possibly be the
 

2837
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,069
right what what could possibly be the
harm right and then

2838
00:48:06,069 --> 00:48:06,079
harm right and then
 

2839
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:08,870
harm right and then
a whole other faction said no you need

2840
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:08,880
a whole other faction said no you need
 

2841
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:09,349
a whole other faction said no you need
to

2842
00:48:09,349 --> 00:48:09,359
to
 

2843
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:12,549
to
cap the data throughput of the system

2844
00:48:12,549 --> 00:48:12,559
cap the data throughput of the system
 

2845
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,430
cap the data throughput of the system
because if you increase it it's going to

2846
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:15,440
because if you increase it it's going to
 

2847
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,670
because if you increase it it's going to
be highly exclusionary

2848
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:17,680
be highly exclusionary
 

2849
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,589
be highly exclusionary
and ultimately regular folks are not

2850
00:48:19,589 --> 00:48:19,599
and ultimately regular folks are not
 

2851
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,349
and ultimately regular folks are not
going to be able to run a full node

2852
00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:21,359
going to be able to run a full node
 

2853
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,750
going to be able to run a full node
so there's a fixed number this is a

2854
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:23,760
so there's a fixed number this is a
 

2855
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,150
so there's a fixed number this is a
fixed frequency of blocks

2856
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:26,160
fixed frequency of blocks
 

2857
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,349
fixed frequency of blocks
and so if you want to increase the

2858
00:48:27,349 --> 00:48:27,359
and so if you want to increase the
 

2859
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,349
and so if you want to increase the
number of transactions

2860
00:48:29,349 --> 00:48:29,359
number of transactions
 

2861
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:31,990
number of transactions
per second you want to increase the size

2862
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:32,000
per second you want to increase the size
 

2863
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:32,870
per second you want to increase the size
of the block so

2864
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:32,880
of the block so
 

2865
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,109
of the block so
huge blocks allow you to shove in a lot

2866
00:48:35,109 --> 00:48:35,119
huge blocks allow you to shove in a lot
 

2867
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:36,230
huge blocks allow you to shove in a lot
of transactions

2868
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:36,240
of transactions
 

2869
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,230
of transactions
right small blocks don't so that's what

2870
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:38,240
right small blocks don't so that's what
 

2871
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,630
right small blocks don't so that's what
you mean like constraining the system

2872
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:40,640
you mean like constraining the system
 

2873
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,109
you mean like constraining the system
so what's the benefit of a small block

2874
00:48:43,109 --> 00:48:43,119
so what's the benefit of a small block
 

2875
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,630
so what's the benefit of a small block
size where transactions

2876
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:46,640
size where transactions
 

2877
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,630
size where transactions
when you can squeeze in only a small

2878
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:48,640
when you can squeeze in only a small
 

2879
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,150
when you can squeeze in only a small
number of transactions

2880
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:50,160
number of transactions
 

2881
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,309
number of transactions
and what's the benefit of a huge block

2882
00:48:52,309 --> 00:48:52,319
and what's the benefit of a huge block
 

2883
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:53,910
and what's the benefit of a huge block
size where you can squeeze in a lot of

2884
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:53,920
size where you can squeeze in a lot of
 

2885
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,109
size where you can squeeze in a lot of
transactions

2886
00:48:55,109 --> 00:48:55,119
transactions
 

2887
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,349
transactions
well it really comes down to the way you

2888
00:48:57,349 --> 00:48:57,359
well it really comes down to the way you
 

2889
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:58,470
well it really comes down to the way you
think about the system

2890
00:48:58,470 --> 00:48:58,480
think about the system
 

2891
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,950
think about the system
so a lot of people wanted bitcoin to be

2892
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:00,960
so a lot of people wanted bitcoin to be
 

2893
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,230
so a lot of people wanted bitcoin to be
visa scale

2894
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:02,240
visa scale
 

2895
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,030
visa scale
so to have blocks sufficiently large

2896
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:05,040
so to have blocks sufficiently large
 

2897
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,470
so to have blocks sufficiently large
that you could accommodate

2898
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:06,480
that you could accommodate
 

2899
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,069
that you could accommodate
a visa level scale of transactions so

2900
00:49:10,069 --> 00:49:10,079
a visa level scale of transactions so
 

2901
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,990
a visa level scale of transactions so
which is many orders of magnitude more

2902
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:12,000
which is many orders of magnitude more
 

2903
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,030
which is many orders of magnitude more
transactions that's right i mean

2904
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:14,040
transactions that's right i mean
 

2905
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,549
transactions that's right i mean
preposterously larger in terms of data

2906
00:49:16,549 --> 00:49:16,559
preposterously larger in terms of data
 

2907
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:17,190
preposterously larger in terms of data
throughput

2908
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:17,200
throughput
 

2909
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,829
throughput
then you know bitcoin offers up or at

2910
00:49:19,829 --> 00:49:19,839
then you know bitcoin offers up or at
 

2911
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:22,790
then you know bitcoin offers up or at
least it used to 144 megabytes of space

2912
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:22,800
least it used to 144 megabytes of space
 

2913
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,750
least it used to 144 megabytes of space
per day

2914
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:23,760
per day
 

2915
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,750
per day
and your average transaction is 350

2916
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:25,760
and your average transaction is 350
 

2917
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,510
and your average transaction is 350
bytes so

2918
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:27,520
bytes so
 

2919
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:31,190
bytes so
you know you could add a push to for 500

2920
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:31,200
you know you could add a push to for 500
 

2921
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,150
you know you could add a push to for 500
000 transactions a day which is not many

2922
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:34,160
000 transactions a day which is not many
 

2923
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,790
000 transactions a day which is not many
so if you wanted to get to visa scale

2924
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:36,800
so if you wanted to get to visa scale
 

2925
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,710
so if you wanted to get to visa scale
you'd have to increase blocks

2926
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:38,720
you'd have to increase blocks
 

2927
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,309
you'd have to increase blocks
obnoxiously large uh the small blockers

2928
00:49:42,309 --> 00:49:42,319
obnoxiously large uh the small blockers
 

2929
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,069
obnoxiously large uh the small blockers
claimed that this would

2930
00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:44,079
claimed that this would
 

2931
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,309
claimed that this would
overwhelm the ability of any regular

2932
00:49:46,309 --> 00:49:46,319
overwhelm the ability of any regular
 

2933
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:47,190
overwhelm the ability of any regular
person to

2934
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:47,200
person to
 

2935
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,990
person to
ingest that data and stay current at the

2936
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:50,000
ingest that data and stay current at the
 

2937
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,069
ingest that data and stay current at the
you know state of the ledger

2938
00:49:52,069 --> 00:49:52,079
you know state of the ledger
 

2939
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,069
you know state of the ledger
to rebroadca to replay all those

2940
00:49:54,069 --> 00:49:54,079
to rebroadca to replay all those
 

2941
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,150
to rebroadca to replay all those
transactions to ensure that the protocol

2942
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:56,160
transactions to ensure that the protocol
 

2943
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,069
transactions to ensure that the protocol
rules were valid so basically

2944
00:49:58,069 --> 00:49:58,079
rules were valid so basically
 

2945
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,870
rules were valid so basically
the small blocker contention is that you

2946
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:00,880
the small blocker contention is that you
 

2947
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,470
the small blocker contention is that you
eliminate the trustlessness

2948
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:02,480
eliminate the trustlessness
 

2949
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,349
eliminate the trustlessness
of the system by pushing a ton of data

00:50:05,349 --> 00:50:05,359
of the system by pushing a ton of data
 

2951
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:07,030
of the system by pushing a ton of data
through the system because only one or

2952
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:07,040
through the system because only one or
 

2953
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:07,990
through the system because only one or
two

2954
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:08,000
two
 

2955
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,710
two
industrial heavy duty nodes would ever

2956
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:10,720
industrial heavy duty nodes would ever
 

2957
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,069
industrial heavy duty nodes would ever
be able to run

2958
00:50:12,069 --> 00:50:12,079
be able to run
 

2959
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,190
be able to run
the protocol at that point so by the way

2960
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:15,200
the protocol at that point so by the way
 

2961
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,109
the protocol at that point so by the way
in the civil war the two sides

2962
00:50:17,109 --> 00:50:17,119
in the civil war the two sides
 

2963
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,190
in the civil war the two sides
as you as you're calling them the small

2964
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:19,200
as you as you're calling them the small
 

2965
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,549
as you as you're calling them the small
blocker and

2966
00:50:20,549 --> 00:50:20,559
blocker and
 

2967
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,069
blocker and
the big blocker sides and so that

2968
00:50:24,069 --> 00:50:24,079
the big blocker sides and so that
 

2969
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,109
the big blocker sides and so that
takes us back to the uh the thing that

2970
00:50:27,109 --> 00:50:27,119
takes us back to the uh the thing that
 

2971
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:29,109
takes us back to the uh the thing that
you mentioned that a regular computer

2972
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:29,119
you mentioned that a regular computer
 

2973
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,870
you mentioned that a regular computer
could be a node

2974
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:30,880
could be a node
 

2975
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,790
could be a node
and uh with a big with big blocks

2976
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:34,800
and uh with a big with big blocks
 

2977
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,790
and uh with a big with big blocks
that's no longer going to be the case so

2978
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:36,800
that's no longer going to be the case so
 

2979
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,150
that's no longer going to be the case so
just the number of transactions

2980
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:38,160
just the number of transactions
 

2981
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,589
just the number of transactions
is going to blow up the size of the

2982
00:50:41,589 --> 00:50:41,599
is going to blow up the size of the
 

2983
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:42,630
is going to blow up the size of the
blockchain

2984
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:42,640
blockchain
 

2985
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,270
blockchain
that every full node has to store and so

2986
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:45,280
that every full node has to store and so
 

2987
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,069
that every full node has to store and so
then

2988
00:50:46,069 --> 00:50:46,079
then
 

2989
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:49,430
then
as opposed to a regular mom-and-pop

2990
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:49,440
as opposed to a regular mom-and-pop
 

2991
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,270
as opposed to a regular mom-and-pop
type of node you're going to have to

2992
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:51,280
type of node you're going to have to
 

2993
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,030
type of node you're going to have to
have data centers

2994
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:53,040
have data centers
 

2995
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,870
have data centers
so they're going to have to be owned by

2996
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:54,880
so they're going to have to be owned by
 

2997
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,230
so they're going to have to be owned by
large organizations there's going to

2998
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:56,240
large organizations there's going to
 

2999
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,069
large organizations there's going to
have to be very few of them

3000
00:50:58,069 --> 00:50:58,079
have to be very few of them
 

3001
00:50:58,079 --> 00:50:59,589
have to be very few of them
and that's how you centralize the

3002
00:50:59,589 --> 00:50:59,599
and that's how you centralize the
 

3003
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,470
and that's how you centralize the
control over this whole

3004
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:02,480
control over this whole
 

3005
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,390
control over this whole
operation so the big blocker

3006
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:06,400
operation so the big blocker
 

3007
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,589
operation so the big blocker
yes it allows you to be visa and do a

3008
00:51:09,589 --> 00:51:09,599
yes it allows you to be visa and do a
 

3009
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,109
yes it allows you to be visa and do a
huge number of transactions but it

3010
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:11,119
huge number of transactions but it
 

3011
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:12,549
huge number of transactions but it
becomes centralized and the small

3012
00:51:12,549 --> 00:51:12,559
becomes centralized and the small
 

3013
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,309
becomes centralized and the small
blockers

3014
00:51:14,309 --> 00:51:14,319
blockers
 

3015
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:17,270
blockers
you cannot actually do kind of merchant

3016
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:17,280
you cannot actually do kind of merchant
 

3017
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,190
you cannot actually do kind of merchant
style transactions

3018
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:19,200
style transactions
 

3019
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,829
style transactions
but you get the decentralized benefit

3020
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:21,839
but you get the decentralized benefit
 

3021
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:23,750
but you get the decentralized benefit
well i don't even think the big block

3022
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:23,760
well i don't even think the big block
 

3023
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,430
well i don't even think the big block
approach would allow you to be visa

3024
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:25,440
approach would allow you to be visa
 

3025
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,150
approach would allow you to be visa
frankly

3026
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:26,160
frankly
 

3027
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,470
frankly
because there's effectively one node at

3028
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:28,480
because there's effectively one node at
 

3029
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,670
because there's effectively one node at
the visa network

3030
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:29,680
the visa network
 

3031
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,910
the visa network
right so you don't really need to

3032
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:31,920
right so you don't really need to
 

3033
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,670
right so you don't really need to
maintain this peer-to-peer architecture

3034
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:33,680
maintain this peer-to-peer architecture
 

3035
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,190
maintain this peer-to-peer architecture
at all

3036
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:35,200
at all
 

3037
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,950
at all
and the amount of data you'd have to

3038
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:36,960
and the amount of data you'd have to
 

3039
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,230
and the amount of data you'd have to
push through the network

3040
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:38,240
push through the network
 

3041
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,829
push through the network
to reach visa scale is a really

3042
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:39,839
to reach visa scale is a really
 

3043
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:41,349
to reach visa scale is a really
preposterous amount

3044
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:41,359
preposterous amount
 

3045
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:44,630
preposterous amount
i mean and we have now evidence for what

3046
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:44,640
i mean and we have now evidence for what
 

3047
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,270
i mean and we have now evidence for what
happens

3048
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:45,280
happens
 

3049
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,630
happens
when you try and scale up as a

3050
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:46,640
when you try and scale up as a
 

3051
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,230
when you try and scale up as a
blockchain and do 10 million

00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:48,240
blockchain and do 10 million

3113
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,349
implementations
in starting in 2015 with bitcoin xt

3114
00:52:57,349 --> 00:52:57,359
in starting in 2015 with bitcoin xt
 

3115
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:59,750
in starting in 2015 with bitcoin xt
um actually gavin anderson who is the

3116
00:52:59,750 --> 00:52:59,760
um actually gavin anderson who is the
 

3117
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,390
um actually gavin anderson who is the
guy that satoshi handed the reins to

3118
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:02,400
guy that satoshi handed the reins to
 

3119
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,790
guy that satoshi handed the reins to
when satoshi left gavin supported this

3120
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:04,800
when satoshi left gavin supported this
 

3121
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,670
when satoshi left gavin supported this
large

3122
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:05,680
large
 

3123
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,109
large
block proposal uh and so that was that

3124
00:53:09,109 --> 00:53:09,119
block proposal uh and so that was that
 

3125
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:09,910
block proposal uh and so that was that
didn't achieve

3126
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:09,920
didn't achieve
 

3127
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,750
didn't achieve
consensus and then there was bitcoin

3128
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:11,760
consensus and then there was bitcoin
 

3129
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,030
consensus and then there was bitcoin
unlimited

3130
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:13,040
unlimited
 

3131
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,710
unlimited
and then later on there was a genuine

3132
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:16,720
and then later on there was a genuine
 

3133
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:17,670
and then later on there was a genuine
hard fork

3134
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:17,680
hard fork
 

3135
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,990
hard fork
where the small blockers couldn't or the

3136
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:20,000
where the small blockers couldn't or the
 

3137
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,349
where the small blockers couldn't or the
large blockers couldn't push through

3138
00:53:21,349 --> 00:53:21,359
large blockers couldn't push through
 

3139
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:22,790
large blockers couldn't push through
their proposals

3140
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:22,800
their proposals
 

3141
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,790
their proposals
on bitcoin itself so they just created a

3142
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:24,800
on bitcoin itself so they just created a
 

3143
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,870
on bitcoin itself so they just created a
competing version of bitcoin you know so

3144
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:26,880
competing version of bitcoin you know so
 

3145
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,150
competing version of bitcoin you know so
by the way uh

3146
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:28,160
by the way uh
 

3147
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,670
by the way uh
maybe you can comment on but sort of

3148
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:29,680
maybe you can comment on but sort of
 

3149
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,150
maybe you can comment on but sort of
hard fork versus a soft fork a hard fork

3150
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:32,160
hard fork versus a soft fork a hard fork
 

3151
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:32,549
hard fork versus a soft fork a hard fork
is

3152
00:53:32,549 --> 00:53:32,559
is
 

3153
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:35,430
is
when it's not no longer compatible

3154
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:35,440
when it's not no longer compatible
 

3155
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,109
when it's not no longer compatible
what's the right way to put it

3156
00:53:37,109 --> 00:53:37,119
what's the right way to put it
 

3157
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:38,470
what's the right way to put it
they can't operate on the same

3158
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:38,480
they can't operate on the same
 

3159
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,470
they can't operate on the same
blockchain they say with the same

3160
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:40,480
blockchain they say with the same
 

3161
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,270
blockchain they say with the same
protocol

3162
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:41,280
protocol
 

3163
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,430
protocol
yeah so there's a few ways to define

3164
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:43,440
yeah so there's a few ways to define
 

3165
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,710
yeah so there's a few ways to define
them and it's

3166
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:44,720
them and it's
 

3167
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,510
them and it's
pretty it gets controversial as well but

3168
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:47,520
pretty it gets controversial as well but
 

3169
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:47,990
pretty it gets controversial as well but
um

3170
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:48,000
um
 

3171
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,870
um
one one way to define it as a hard fork

3172
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:50,880
one one way to define it as a hard fork
 

3173
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:51,430
one one way to define it as a hard fork
is

3174
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:51,440
is
 

3175
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,630
is
a expansion of protocol rules and a soft

3176
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:54,640
a expansion of protocol rules and a soft
 

3177
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,190
a expansion of protocol rules and a soft
fork as a shrinking of protocol rules

3178
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:57,200
fork as a shrinking of protocol rules
 

3179
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,470
fork as a shrinking of protocol rules
that's an interesting way to find it

3180
00:53:58,470 --> 00:53:58,480
that's an interesting way to find it
 

3181
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,309
that's an interesting way to find it
it's not very intuitive so i don't like

3182
00:54:00,309 --> 00:54:00,319
it's not very intuitive so i don't like
 

3183
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:01,030
it's not very intuitive so i don't like
that way

3184
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:01,040
that way
 

3185
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,150
that way
um another way is that a hard fork is

3186
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:04,160
um another way is that a hard fork is
 

3187
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,990
um another way is that a hard fork is
backwards and compatible whereas

3188
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:06,000
backwards and compatible whereas
 

3189
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,190
backwards and compatible whereas
softwork is

3190
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:07,200
softwork is
 

3191
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,470
softwork is
in theory backwards compatible so in

3192
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:10,480
in theory backwards compatible so in
 

3193
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,670
in theory backwards compatible so in
august 2017 basically the large blockers

3194
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:13,680
august 2017 basically the large blockers
 

3195
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,710
august 2017 basically the large blockers
had had enough

3196
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:14,720
had had enough
 

3197
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,270
had had enough
and they said we're going to hard fork

3198
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:17,280
and they said we're going to hard fork
 

3199
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,230
and they said we're going to hard fork
bitcoin we're going to

3200
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:18,240
bitcoin we're going to
 

3201
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,109
bitcoin we're going to
create a clone an alternative version of

3202
00:54:21,109 --> 00:54:21,119
create a clone an alternative version of
 

3203
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:22,230
create a clone an alternative version of
bitcoin

3204
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:22,240
bitcoin
 

3205
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,270
bitcoin
which has the same a shared history

3206
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:25,280
which has the same a shared history
 

3207
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,150
which has the same a shared history
as bitcoin itself but you completely

3208
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:28,160
as bitcoin itself but you completely
 

3209
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,790
as bitcoin itself but you completely
fork it and you create a new future

3210
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:30,800
fork it and you create a new future
 

3211
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,109
fork it and you create a new future
and uh but you know everybody that had a

3212
00:54:33,109 --> 00:54:33,119
and uh but you know everybody that had a
 

3213
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:34,870
and uh but you know everybody that had a
balance on bitcoin at the time

3214
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:34,880
balance on bitcoin at the time
 

3215
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,109
balance on bitcoin at the time
also had a balance on the alternative

3216
00:54:37,109 --> 00:54:37,119
also had a balance on the alternative
 

3217
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:39,030
also had a balance on the alternative
coin bitcoin cash

3218
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:39,040
coin bitcoin cash
 

3219
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,710
coin bitcoin cash
and so that was really that's what it's

3220
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:40,720
and so that was really that's what it's
 

3221
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,950
and so that was really that's what it's
called bitcoin cash is the hard fork

3222
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:42,960
called bitcoin cash is the hard fork
 

3223
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,549
called bitcoin cash is the hard fork
that was one of them there were more

3224
00:54:44,549 --> 00:54:44,559
that was one of them there were more
 

3225
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:45,990
that was one of them there were more
actually i mean what what the heck

3226
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:46,000
actually i mean what what the heck
 

3227
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,549
actually i mean what what the heck
is bitcoin satoshi uh satoshi's vision

3228
00:54:48,549 --> 00:54:48,559
is bitcoin satoshi uh satoshi's vision
 

3229
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:49,270
is bitcoin satoshi uh satoshi's vision
bsv

3230
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:49,280
bsv
 

3231
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,750
bsv
bitcoin sv so this is all talking about

3232
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:51,760
bitcoin sv so this is all talking about
 

3233
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,270
bitcoin sv so this is all talking about
increasing the max

3234
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:53,280
increasing the max
 

3235
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,109
increasing the max
the limit of the block size more and

3236
00:54:55,109 --> 00:54:55,119
the limit of the block size more and
 

3237
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:57,589
the limit of the block size more and
more and more yeah that was one of the

3238
00:54:57,589 --> 00:54:57,599
more and more yeah that was one of the
 

3239
00:54:57,599 --> 00:54:59,430
more and more yeah that was one of the
changes they wanted to push through uh

3240
00:54:59,430 --> 00:54:59,440
changes they wanted to push through uh
 

3241
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,870
changes they wanted to push through uh
but bsv was the fork

3242
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:00,880
but bsv was the fork
 

3243
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,150
but bsv was the fork
of bitcoin cash so hard fork of bitcoin

3244
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:04,160
of bitcoin cash so hard fork of bitcoin
 

3245
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,870
of bitcoin cash so hard fork of bitcoin
yeah so and so now there's multiple big

3246
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:06,880
yeah so and so now there's multiple big
 

3247
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:07,589
yeah so and so now there's multiple big
blocker

3248
00:55:07,589 --> 00:55:07,599
blocker
 

3249
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:09,190
blocker
block chains floating around it's like

3250
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:09,200
block chains floating around it's like
 

3251
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,630
block chains floating around it's like
what are your thoughts about them

3252
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:10,640
what are your thoughts about them
 

3253
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,109
what are your thoughts about them
well i was pretty popular sorry to

3254
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:13,119
well i was pretty popular sorry to
 

3255
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:14,150
well i was pretty popular sorry to
interrupt

3256
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:14,160
interrupt
 

3257
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,750
interrupt
uh are they popular i mean if you look

3258
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:15,760
uh are they popular i mean if you look
 

3259
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,270
uh are they popular i mean if you look
at the metrics they're not and

3260
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:17,280
at the metrics they're not and
 

3261
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,069
at the metrics they're not and
oh they they don't trade they i think

3262
00:55:20,069 --> 00:55:20,079
oh they they don't trade they i think
 

3263
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:21,750
oh they they don't trade they i think
each trade below one percent of the

3264
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:21,760
each trade below one percent of the
 

3265
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,349
each trade below one percent of the
value of bitcoin itself i see so

3266
00:55:23,349 --> 00:55:23,359
value of bitcoin itself i see so
 

3267
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:25,109
value of bitcoin itself i see so
measuring popularity is like how much

3268
00:55:25,109 --> 00:55:25,119
measuring popularity is like how much
 

3269
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:26,549
measuring popularity is like how much
they actually oh

3270
00:55:26,549 --> 00:55:26,559
they actually oh
 

3271
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:29,109
they actually oh
value uh value frequency of trade oh no

3272
00:55:29,109 --> 00:55:29,119
value uh value frequency of trade oh no
 

3273
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:30,230
value uh value frequency of trade oh no
no i mean

3274
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:30,240
no i mean
 

3275
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,589
no i mean
they they do like a fair number of

3276
00:55:31,589 --> 00:55:31,599
they they do like a fair number of
 

3277
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:33,270
they they do like a fair number of
transactions but there's an there's no

3278
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:33,280
transactions but there's an there's no
 

3279
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,349
transactions but there's an there's no
way to know that that is genuine

3280
00:55:35,349 --> 00:55:35,359
way to know that that is genuine
 

3281
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:38,470
way to know that that is genuine
or just contrived so you know ultimately

3282
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:38,480
or just contrived so you know ultimately
 

3283
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,230
or just contrived so you know ultimately
the true measure i think in my mind is

3284
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:40,240
the true measure i think in my mind is
 

3285
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,030
the true measure i think in my mind is
just

3286
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:41,040
just
 

3287
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,910
just
where the market prices these protocols

3288
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:43,920
where the market prices these protocols
 

3289
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,750
where the market prices these protocols
relative to bitcoin

3290
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:45,760
relative to bitcoin
 

3291
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,190
relative to bitcoin
uh because that's like a prediction

3292
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:47,200
uh because that's like a prediction
 

3293
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,789
uh because that's like a prediction
market if

3294
00:55:48,789 --> 00:55:48,799
market if
 

3295
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:51,430
market if
if bitcoin cash was being priced at 50

3296
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:51,440
if bitcoin cash was being priced at 50
 

3297
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,270
if bitcoin cash was being priced at 50
of bitcoin you could say

3298
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:53,280
of bitcoin you could say
 

3299
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,309
of bitcoin you could say
the market has given it a 50 chance of

3300
00:55:56,309 --> 00:55:56,319
the market has given it a 50 chance of
 

3301
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:57,430
the market has given it a 50 chance of
unseating bitcoin

3302
00:55:57,430 --> 00:55:57,440
unseating bitcoin
 

3303
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,470
unseating bitcoin
right but both bitcoin cash and bitcoin

3304
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:00,480
right but both bitcoin cash and bitcoin
 

3305
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,109
right but both bitcoin cash and bitcoin
sv which was a hard fork from bitcoin

3306
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:03,119
sv which was a hard fork from bitcoin
 

3307
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:04,549
sv which was a hard fork from bitcoin
cash itself

3308
00:56:04,549 --> 00:56:04,559
cash itself
 

3309
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,549
cash itself
are well i believe at this point well

3310
00:56:06,549 --> 00:56:06,559
are well i believe at this point well
 

3311
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:07,829
are well i believe at this point well

uh yeah number two and then bitcoin cash

3324
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:18,960
uh yeah number two and then bitcoin cash
 

3325
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:19,670
uh yeah number two and then bitcoin cash
is the one that

3326
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:19,680
is the one that
 

3327
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,510
is the one that
it's in the top five right but it's just

3328
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:21,520
it's in the top five right but it's just
 

3329
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,950
it's in the top five right but it's just
a fast drop off

3330
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:22,960
a fast drop off
 

3331
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,549
a fast drop off
you know i haven't checked lately but i

3332
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:24,559
you know i haven't checked lately but i
 

3333
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:26,470
you know i haven't checked lately but i
think it's it's reached kind of

3334
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:26,480
think it's it's reached kind of
 

3335
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,349
think it's it's reached kind of
morbidity

3336
00:56:27,349 --> 00:56:27,359
morbidity
 

3337
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:29,750
morbidity
you know it doesn't really have much

3338
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:29,760
you know it doesn't really have much
 

3339
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:30,870
you know it doesn't really have much
traction

3340
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:30,880
traction
 

3341
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,030
traction
um the blocks aren't full so the whole

3342
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:33,040
um the blocks aren't full so the whole
 

3343
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,309
um the blocks aren't full so the whole
value proposition was

3344
00:56:34,309 --> 00:56:34,319
value proposition was
 

3345
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:36,069
value proposition was
you know we will get all this merchant

3346
00:56:36,069 --> 00:56:36,079
you know we will get all this merchant
 

3347
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,309
you know we will get all this merchant
adoption if we increase the block size

3348
00:56:38,309 --> 00:56:38,319
adoption if we increase the block size
 

3349
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:40,230
adoption if we increase the block size
that just didn't materialize

3350
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:40,240
that just didn't materialize
 

3351
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,870
that just didn't materialize
in my view they had a flawed vision of

3352
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:42,880
in my view they had a flawed vision of
 

3353
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,150
in my view they had a flawed vision of
how adoption works

3354
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:44,160
how adoption works
 

3355
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,750
how adoption works
and what blockchain should optimize for

3356
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:47,760
and what blockchain should optimize for
 

3357
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,990
and what blockchain should optimize for
uh maybe maybe you get a bitcoin cash

3358
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:50,000
uh maybe maybe you get a bitcoin cash
 

3359
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,349
uh maybe maybe you get a bitcoin cash
supporter on the show they'll give you a

3360
00:56:51,349 --> 00:56:51,359
supporter on the show they'll give you a
 

3361
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:52,789
supporter on the show they'll give you a
different answer

3362
00:56:52,789 --> 00:56:52,799
different answer
 

3363
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:54,150
different answer
but yeah full disclosure you know i have

3364
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:54,160
but yeah full disclosure you know i have
 

3365
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,990
but yeah full disclosure you know i have
my sympathies and

3366
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:56,000
my sympathies and
 

3367
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,150
my sympathies and
i think the small blockers won that

3368
00:56:58,150 --> 00:56:58,160
i think the small blockers won that
 

3369
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,069
i think the small blockers won that
skirmish for sure so at this time

3370
00:57:00,069 --> 00:57:00,079
skirmish for sure so at this time
 

3371
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:00,789
skirmish for sure so at this time
there's no

3372
00:57:00,789 --> 00:57:00,799
there's no
 

3373
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:02,549
there's no
merchant adoption and so on so it's kind

3374
00:57:02,549 --> 00:57:02,559
merchant adoption and so on so it's kind
 

3375
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:04,549
merchant adoption and so on so it's kind
of its vision the whole

3376
00:57:04,549 --> 00:57:04,559
of its vision the whole
 

3377
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:06,710
of its vision the whole
reason for existence for at least for

3378
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:06,720
reason for existence for at least for
 

3379
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,630
reason for existence for at least for
now hasn't materialized

3380
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:08,640
now hasn't materialized
 

3381
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,670
now hasn't materialized
and so that's that's the indication it's

3382
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:11,680
and so that's that's the indication it's
 

3383
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:12,470
and so that's that's the indication it's
possible that

3384
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:12,480
possible that
 

3385
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:15,990
possible that
well it's a sign that perhaps that's the

3386
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:16,000
well it's a sign that perhaps that's the
 

3387
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,630
well it's a sign that perhaps that's the
wrong way to accomplish the scalability

3388
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:18,640
wrong way to accomplish the scalability
 

3389
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,950
wrong way to accomplish the scalability
well you know first of all i think the

3390
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:20,960
well you know first of all i think the
 

3391
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,270
well you know first of all i think the
layered scaling model is definitely

3392
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:23,280
layered scaling model is definitely
 

3393
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,789
layered scaling model is definitely
definitely correct i mean that's

3394
00:57:24,789 --> 00:57:24,799
definitely correct i mean that's
 

3395
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:26,390
definitely correct i mean that's
absolutely the way these things have to

3396
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:26,400
absolutely the way these things have to
 

3397
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:26,870
absolutely the way these things have to
work

3398
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:26,880
work
 

3399
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,030
work
given the constraints of blockchains

3400
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:29,040
given the constraints of blockchains
 

3401
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,309
given the constraints of blockchains
what is the layered

3402
00:57:30,309 --> 00:57:30,319
what is the layered
 

3403
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:32,549
what is the layered
scaling model it's really how all

3404
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:32,559
scaling model it's really how all
 

3405
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:34,069
scaling model it's really how all
payment systems scale

3406
00:57:34,069 --> 00:57:34,079
payment systems scale
 

3407
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:36,470
payment systems scale
blockchain or otherwise and i think a

3408
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:36,480
blockchain or otherwise and i think a
 

3409
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,309
blockchain or otherwise and i think a
lot of people don't understand this

3410
00:57:38,309 --> 00:57:38,319
lot of people don't understand this
 

3411
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:41,430
lot of people don't understand this
is that there is no equivalent to

3412
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:41,440
is that there is no equivalent to
 

3413
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,870
is that there is no equivalent to
scaling at the base layer

3414
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:42,880
scaling at the base layer
 

3415
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,950
scaling at the base layer
in the regular payment space that

3416
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:44,960
in the regular payment space that
 

3417
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,710
in the regular payment space that
totally doesn't happen

3418
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:46,720
totally doesn't happen
 

3419
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,710
totally doesn't happen
all of them are built on layers so visa

3420
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:48,720
all of them are built on layers so visa
 

3421
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,390
all of them are built on layers so visa
is like the fifth layer

3422
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:50,400
is like the fifth layer
 

3423
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,230
is like the fifth layer
in the payment stack that ultimately

3424
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:52,240
in the payment stack that ultimately
 

3425
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,549
in the payment stack that ultimately
depends on these utility scale

3426
00:57:54,549 --> 00:57:54,559
depends on these utility scale
 

3427
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:56,950
depends on these utility scale
settlement systems like fedwire

3428
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:56,960
settlement systems like fedwire
 

3429
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,150
settlement systems like fedwire
chips ach basically interbank settlement

3430
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:00,160
chips ach basically interbank settlement
 

3431
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,190
chips ach basically interbank settlement
systems

3432
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:01,200
systems
 

3433
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,309
systems
so you've got these slow moving but high

3434
00:58:04,309 --> 00:58:04,319
so you've got these slow moving but high
 

3435
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:05,510
so you've got these slow moving but high

and then you have payment processors
 

3449
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:19,990
and then you have payment processors
and then you build up these layers and

and the settlement those are distinct
 

3473
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:44,710
and the settlement those are distinct
concepts and the settlement happens on a

so that's how you get scalability is you

3478
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:49,119
so that's how you get scalability is you
 

3479
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:50,230
so that's how you get scalability is you
have lots and lots of

3483
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:54,789

a long time
 

3485
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:56,710
a long time
they might settle on a net basis on an

00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:56,720
they might settle on a net basis on an

end-of-day basis
 

3489
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,870
end-of-day basis
but so that's really how it works and

3490
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:00,880
but so that's really how it works and
 

3491
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,150
but so that's really how it works and

01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:48,240
than the rate of the transactions
 

3599
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,390
than the rate of the transactions
that's kind of it's a really interesting

3600
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:50,400
that's kind of it's a really interesting
 

3601
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,950
that's kind of it's a really interesting
idea that when we spend money

3602
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:52,960
idea that when we spend money
 

3603
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,069
idea that when we spend money
we didn't actually exchange the money

3604
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:56,079
we didn't actually exchange the money
 

3605
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:57,829
we didn't actually exchange the money
most of the time yeah most of the time

3606
01:00:57,829 --> 01:00:57,839
most of the time yeah most of the time
 

3607
01:00:57,839 --> 01:00:59,510
most of the time yeah most of the time
you're not getting final settlement when

3608
01:00:59,510 --> 01:00:59,520
you're not getting final settlement when
 

3609
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,349
you're not getting final settlement when
you do a transaction

3610
01:01:01,349 --> 01:01:01,359
you do a transaction
 

3611
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:04,630
you do a transaction
and oftentimes that causes there

3612
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:04,640
and oftentimes that causes there
 

3613
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,710
and oftentimes that causes there
are there's pluses and minuses on the

3614
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:06,720
are there's pluses and minuses on the
 

3615
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,549
are there's pluses and minuses on the
plus side you have huge efficiency

3616
01:01:08,549 --> 01:01:08,559
plus side you have huge efficiency
 

3617
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:10,630
plus side you have huge efficiency
if you use a credit network like visa

3618
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:10,640
if you use a credit network like visa
 

3619
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,390
if you use a credit network like visa
but that it's in the name credit

3620
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:12,400
but that it's in the name credit
 

3621
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,870
but that it's in the name credit
right visa is extending you credit right

3622
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:14,880
right visa is extending you credit right
 

3623
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,069
right visa is extending you credit right
they're kind of guaranteeing your

01:01:16,069 --> 01:01:16,079
they're kind of guaranteeing your
 

3625
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:17,910
they're kind of guaranteeing your
reputation to the merchant

reputation to the merchant
 

3627
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,589
reputation to the merchant
but fraud happens all the time right

3628
01:01:19,589 --> 01:01:19,599
but fraud happens all the time right
 

3629
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:21,430
but fraud happens all the time right
there's always fraud

3630
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:21,440
there's always fraud
 

3631
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,230
there's always fraud
because you have this reversibility

3632
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:24,240
because you have this reversibility
 

3633
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,030
because you have this reversibility
right

3634
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:25,040
right
 

3635
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,589
right
um and so you can you know engage in

3636
01:01:27,589 --> 01:01:27,599
um and so you can you know engage in
 

3637
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:29,349
um and so you can you know engage in
fraud against a merchant

3638
01:01:29,349 --> 01:01:29,359
fraud against a merchant
 

3639
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:32,390
fraud against a merchant
um if you have a final settlement

3640
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:32,400
um if you have a final settlement
 

3641
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,309
um if you have a final settlement
there's no possibility for fraud so

3642
01:01:34,309 --> 01:01:34,319
there's no possibility for fraud so
 

3643
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:36,230
there's no possibility for fraud so
that's one reason merchants kind of like

3644
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:36,240
that's one reason merchants kind of like
 

3645
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,750
that's one reason merchants kind of like
accepting bitcoin because

3646
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:37,760
accepting bitcoin because
 

3647
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,390
accepting bitcoin because
once you receive an inbound bitcoin

3648
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:40,400
once you receive an inbound bitcoin
 

3649
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,430
once you receive an inbound bitcoin
payment and you

3650
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:41,440
payment and you
 

3651
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,630
payment and you
deliver some good or service you know

3652
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:44,640

that payment can't be reversed
 

3655
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:49,589
that payment can't be reversed
but frankly most of the transactions we

3656
01:01:49,589 --> 01:01:49,599
but frankly most of the transactions we
 

3657
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:52,150
but frankly most of the transactions we
you know undertake on a daily basis

01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:52,160
you know undertake on a daily basis
 

3659
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,390
you know undertake on a daily basis
do not require those strong assurances

3660
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:54,400
do not require those strong assurances
 

3661
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,910
do not require those strong assurances
of final settlement

01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:55,920
of final settlement
 

3663
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,589
of final settlement
there's one exception which is physical

you actually are getting final

they're not really final at all you

3682
01:02:18,549 --> 01:02:18,559
they're not really final at all you
 

3683
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:19,750
they're not really final at all you
mentioned lightning

3684
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:19,760
mentioned lightning
 

3685
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,630
mentioned lightning
lightning network what is it what are

3686
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:22,640
lightning network what is it what are
 

3687
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:23,190
lightning network what is it what are
your thoughts

3688
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:23,200
your thoughts
 

3689
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,510
your thoughts
on it and what are your thoughts about

3690
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:25,520
on it and what are your thoughts about
 

3691
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,349
on it and what are your thoughts about
any kind of alternatives

3692
01:02:27,349 --> 01:02:27,359
any kind of alternatives
 

3693
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:30,950
any kind of alternatives
so lightning is one potential

3694
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:30,960
so lightning is one potential
 

3695
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,069
so lightning is one potential
payment solution built on top of bitcoin

3696
01:02:34,069 --> 01:02:34,079
payment solution built on top of bitcoin
 

3697
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:36,230
payment solution built on top of bitcoin
where you have different assurances

3698
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:36,240
where you have different assurances
 

3699
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,470
where you have different assurances
different transactional assurances

3700
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:38,480
different transactional assurances
 

3701
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,230
different transactional assurances
but ultimately it's very proximate to

3702
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:40,240
but ultimately it's very proximate to
 

3703
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,069
but ultimately it's very proximate to
the base layer so if something goes

3704
01:02:42,069 --> 01:02:42,079
the base layer so if something goes
 

3705
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:43,829
the base layer so if something goes
wrong you can always basically settle to

3706
01:02:43,829 --> 01:02:43,839
wrong you can always basically settle to
 

3707
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:45,430
wrong you can always basically settle to
the base layer this layer two

3708
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:45,440
the base layer this layer two
 

3709
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:48,950
the base layer this layer two
yeah layer two you could say and

3710
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:48,960
yeah layer two you could say and
 

3711
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,870
yeah layer two you could say and
basically the intuition is kind of like

3712
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:50,880
basically the intuition is kind of like
 

3713
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,309
basically the intuition is kind of like
opening a bar tab

3714
01:02:52,309 --> 01:02:52,319
opening a bar tab
 

3715
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:54,390
opening a bar tab
so you go to the bar and you might drink

3716
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:54,400
so you go to the bar and you might drink
 

3717
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,069
so you go to the bar and you might drink
a dozen beers over the course of the

3718
01:02:56,069 --> 01:02:56,079
a dozen beers over the course of the
 

3719
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:56,870
a dozen beers over the course of the
night

3720
01:02:56,870 --> 01:02:56,880
night
 

3721
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,069
night
maybe half a dozen um

3722
01:03:00,069 --> 01:03:00,079
maybe half a dozen um
 

3723
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:01,829
maybe half a dozen um
and well i guess nobody goes to the bar

3724
01:03:01,829 --> 01:03:01,839
and well i guess nobody goes to the bar
 

3725
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:03,270
and well i guess nobody goes to the bar
these days but

3726
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:03,280
these days but
 

3727
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,710
these days but
let's say you did yeah you open a tab

3728
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:06,720
let's say you did yeah you open a tab
 

3729
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,230
let's say you did yeah you open a tab
and at the end of the night you settle

3730
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:08,240
and at the end of the night you settle
 

3731
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,230
and at the end of the night you settle
up once you're not

3732
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:10,240
up once you're not
 

3733
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,789
up once you're not
necessarily paying each time you get

3734
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:12,799
necessarily paying each time you get
 

3735
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:14,069
necessarily paying each time you get
another beer

3736
01:03:14,069 --> 01:03:14,079
another beer
 

3737
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:15,510
another beer
so it's it's the same idea you're

3738
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:15,520
so it's it's the same idea you're
 

3739
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,190
so it's it's the same idea you're
opening a channel an ongoing

3740
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:17,200
opening a channel an ongoing
 

3741
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,430
opening a channel an ongoing
relationship with your counterparty

3742
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:19,440
relationship with your counterparty
 

3743
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,069
relationship with your counterparty
and so lightning has you open a channel

3744
01:03:22,069 --> 01:03:22,079
and so lightning has you open a channel
 

3745
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:23,829
and so lightning has you open a channel
the counterparty and you're sort of

3746
01:03:23,829 --> 01:03:23,839
the counterparty and you're sort of
 

3747
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:24,870
the counterparty and you're sort of
sending back and forth these

3748
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:24,880
sending back and forth these
 

3749
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,870
sending back and forth these
cryptographic commitments saying you

3750
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:26,880
cryptographic commitments saying you
 

3751
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,870
cryptographic commitments saying you
know i agree to send you some bitcoin

3752
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:28,880
know i agree to send you some bitcoin
 

3753
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,549
know i agree to send you some bitcoin
but you don't necessarily settle each

3754
01:03:30,549 --> 01:03:30,559
but you don't necessarily settle each
 

3755
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,150
but you don't necessarily settle each
time you make a transaction so you do

3756
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:32,160
time you make a transaction so you do
 

3757
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,190
time you make a transaction so you do
hundreds of thousands

3758
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:33,200
hundreds of thousands
 

3759
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,990
hundreds of thousands
of transactions in a channel the other

3760
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:36,000
of transactions in a channel the other
 

3761
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,990
of transactions in a channel the other
thing lightning proposes is saying okay

3762
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:38,000
thing lightning proposes is saying okay
 

3763
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:38,710
thing lightning proposes is saying okay
well

3764
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:38,720
well
 

3765
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,430
well
now that we have channels established

3766
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:41,440
now that we have channels established
 

3767
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,190
now that we have channels established
what if we interlocked a number of

3768
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:43,200
what if we interlocked a number of
 

3769
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,069
what if we interlocked a number of
channels together

3770
01:03:44,069 --> 01:03:44,079
channels together
 

3771
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:46,390
channels together
so if you and i have a channel and you

3772
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:46,400
so if you and i have a channel and you
 

3773
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,910
so if you and i have a channel and you
know me and my buddy have a channel

3774
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:47,920
know me and my buddy have a channel
 

3775
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:50,630
know me and my buddy have a channel
my buddy can now pay you because you're

3776
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:50,640
my buddy can now pay you because you're
 

3777
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,630
my buddy can now pay you because you're
you have a relationship through me

3778
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:52,640
you have a relationship through me
 

3779
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,870
you have a relationship through me
basically and so lightning is this

3780
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:54,880
basically and so lightning is this
 

3781
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,710
basically and so lightning is this
network this overlay network that sits

3782
01:03:56,710 --> 01:03:56,720
network this overlay network that sits
 

3783
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,470
network this overlay network that sits
on top of bitcoin

3784
01:03:58,470 --> 01:03:58,480
on top of bitcoin
 

3785
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,029
on top of bitcoin
and allows people to transact in a much

3786
01:04:01,029 --> 01:04:01,039
and allows people to transact in a much
 

3787
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:03,510
and allows people to transact in a much
faster and less frictional way

3788
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:03,520
faster and less frictional way
 

3789
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,510
faster and less frictional way
without the need for bitcoin's kind of

3790
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:05,520
without the need for bitcoin's kind of
 

3791
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,069
without the need for bitcoin's kind of
slow periodic settlement

3792
01:04:08,069 --> 01:04:08,079
slow periodic settlement
 

3793
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:10,829
slow periodic settlement
um assuming that everything sort of goes

3794
01:04:10,829 --> 01:04:10,839
um assuming that everything sort of goes
 

3795
01:04:10,839 --> 01:04:12,230
um assuming that everything sort of goes
well uh

3796
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:12,240
well uh
 

3797
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,069
well uh
do you see any downsides to this like

3798
01:04:14,069 --> 01:04:14,079
do you see any downsides to this like
 

3799
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:15,990
do you see any downsides to this like
have you seen flaws in the whole system

3800
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:16,000
have you seen flaws in the whole system
 

3801
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,829
have you seen flaws in the whole system
from a security perspective from a

3802
01:04:17,829 --> 01:04:17,839
from a security perspective from a
 

3803
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:19,829
from a security perspective from a
scaling perspective

3804
01:04:19,829 --> 01:04:19,839
scaling perspective
 

3805
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:21,670
scaling perspective
any of that or is it is lightning

3806
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:21,680
any of that or is it is lightning
 

3807
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,029
any of that or is it is lightning
working well

3808
01:04:23,029 --> 01:04:23,039
working well
 

3809
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:25,910
working well
it works i've i use it um when i

3810
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:25,920
it works i've i use it um when i
 

3811
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:26,549
it works i've i use it um when i
initially

3812
01:04:26,549 --> 01:04:26,559
initially
 

3813
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:28,549
initially
sold those dice i sold them on lightning

3814
01:04:28,549 --> 01:04:28,559
sold those dice i sold them on lightning
 

3815
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:29,990
sold those dice i sold them on lightning
i was one of the first

3816
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:30,000
i was one of the first
 

3817
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,069
i was one of the first
merchants to use lightning back in the

3818
01:04:32,069 --> 01:04:32,079
merchants to use lightning back in the
 

3819
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:35,349
merchants to use lightning back in the
day uh the first edition of the dice

3820
01:04:35,349 --> 01:04:35,359
day uh the first edition of the dice
 

3821
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:37,510
day uh the first edition of the dice
so people could buy these guys somewhere

3822
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:37,520
so people could buy these guys somewhere
 

3823
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,029
so people could buy these guys somewhere
well they used to be able to i haven't

3824
01:04:39,029 --> 01:04:39,039
well they used to be able to i haven't
 

3825
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:39,990
well they used to be able to i haven't
made a new addition

3826
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:40,000
made a new addition
 

3827
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,549
made a new addition
recently they're very scarce and very

3828
01:04:42,549 --> 01:04:42,559
recently they're very scarce and very
 

3829
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:43,109
recently they're very scarce and very
special

3830
01:04:43,109 --> 01:04:43,119
special
 

3831
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:46,870
special
they're like physical nfts just kind of

3832
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:46,880
they're like physical nfts just kind of
 

3833
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,870
they're like physical nfts just kind of
yeah i mean the flaw with lightning is

3834
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:48,880
yeah i mean the flaw with lightning is
 

3835
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,230
yeah i mean the flaw with lightning is
really that you

3836
01:04:50,230 --> 01:04:50,240
really that you
 

3837
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:51,670
really that you
you know and this can be remediated a

3838
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:51,680
you know and this can be remediated a
 

3839
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,029
you know and this can be remediated a
number of ways but you have to sort of

3840
01:04:53,029 --> 01:04:53,039
number of ways but you have to sort of
 

3841
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:55,190
number of ways but you have to sort of
pre-fund these channels so it's

3842
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:55,200
pre-fund these channels so it's
 

3843
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,190
pre-fund these channels so it's
it's a weird concept to have to inject

3844
01:04:57,190 --> 01:04:57,200
it's a weird concept to have to inject
 

3845
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,630
it's a weird concept to have to inject
liquidity into a channel

3846
01:04:58,630 --> 01:04:58,640
liquidity into a channel
 

3847
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:02,150
liquidity into a channel
in order to accept a payment you know so

3848
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:02,160
in order to accept a payment you know so
 

3849
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,470
in order to accept a payment you know so
i'm sure those user experience problems

3850
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:04,480
i'm sure those user experience problems
 

3851
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,910
i'm sure those user experience problems
can be solved

3852
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:05,920
can be solved
 

3853
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,789
can be solved
but it's still uh in a state of relative

3854
01:05:08,789 --> 01:05:08,799
but it's still uh in a state of relative
 

3855
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:09,990
but it's still uh in a state of relative
immaturity

3856
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:10,000
immaturity
 

3857
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,349
immaturity
so we'll see in terms of other ideas

3858
01:05:13,349 --> 01:05:13,359
so we'll see in terms of other ideas
 

3859
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:14,309
so we'll see in terms of other ideas
that are

3860
01:05:14,309 --> 01:05:14,319
that are
 

3861
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:17,430
that are
side chains or soft forks of bitcoin

3862
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:17,440
side chains or soft forks of bitcoin
 

3863
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,950
side chains or soft forks of bitcoin
you've mentioned something about schnoor

3864
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:18,960
you've mentioned something about schnoor
 

3865
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,349
you've mentioned something about schnoor
and taproot

3866
01:05:21,349 --> 01:05:21,359
and taproot
 

3867
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:22,870
and taproot
what are your thoughts about this update

3868
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:22,880
what are your thoughts about this update
 

3869
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,109
what are your thoughts about this update
to bitcoin

3870
01:05:25,109 --> 01:05:25,119
to bitcoin
 

3871
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:27,829
to bitcoin
and in terms of its promise to improve

3872
01:05:27,829 --> 01:05:27,839
and in terms of its promise to improve
 

3873
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:29,109
and in terms of its promise to improve
privacy and scaling

3874
01:05:29,109 --> 01:05:29,119
privacy and scaling
 

3875
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:31,349
privacy and scaling
and so on and what what other things are

3876
01:05:31,349 --> 01:05:31,359
and so on and what what other things are
 

3877
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:33,670
and so on and what what other things are
you interested excited about in terms of

3878
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:33,680
you interested excited about in terms of
 

3879
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,589
you interested excited about in terms of
the development of bitcoin

3880
01:05:35,589 --> 01:05:35,599
the development of bitcoin
 

3881
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,910
the development of bitcoin
well schnorr and toproot that's the

3882
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:37,920
well schnorr and toproot that's the
 

3883
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,910
well schnorr and toproot that's the
first new protocol upgrade

3884
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:39,920
first new protocol upgrade
 

3885
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:45,190
first new protocol upgrade
since segwit in 2017 which was what

3886
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:45,200
since segwit in 2017 which was what
 

3887
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,710
since segwit in 2017 which was what
laid the groundwork for lightning to be

3888
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:46,720
laid the groundwork for lightning to be
 

3889
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,470
laid the groundwork for lightning to be
developed basically

3890
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:48,480
developed basically
 

3891
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,270
developed basically
and fruit is really the first protocol

3892
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:51,280
and fruit is really the first protocol
 

3893
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,069
and fruit is really the first protocol
change

3894
01:05:52,069 --> 01:05:52,079
change
 

3895
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:55,109
change
in three almost four years now

3896
01:05:55,109 --> 01:05:55,119
in three almost four years now
 

3897
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:58,390
in three almost four years now
so it's we're very excited about it

3898
01:05:58,390 --> 01:05:58,400
so it's we're very excited about it
 

3899
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,190
so it's we're very excited about it
what uh what are i mean is there any

3900
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:01,200
what uh what are i mean is there any
 

3901
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,470
what uh what are i mean is there any
something interesting to say

3902
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:02,480
something interesting to say
 

3903
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,230
something interesting to say
technically about what are the things

3904
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:04,240
technically about what are the things
 

3905
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,309
technically about what are the things
that's actually going to improve

3906
01:06:06,309 --> 01:06:06,319
that's actually going to improve
 

3907
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:10,470
that's actually going to improve
and um maybe on a on the politics side

3908
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:10,480
and um maybe on a on the politics side
 

3909
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,750
and um maybe on a on the politics side
bringing a protocol change

3910
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:13,760
bringing a protocol change
 

3911
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,990
bringing a protocol change
uh on bitcoin what does that actually

3912
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:16,000
uh on bitcoin what does that actually
 

3913
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,150
uh on bitcoin what does that actually
involve yeah i mean it's a huge deal

3914
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:18,160
involve yeah i mean it's a huge deal
 

3915
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,990
involve yeah i mean it's a huge deal
because the last time we tried to make a

3916
01:06:19,990 --> 01:06:20,000
because the last time we tried to make a
 

3917
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,349
because the last time we tried to make a
change to the protocol we had whole

3918
01:06:21,349 --> 01:06:21,359
change to the protocol we had whole
 

3919
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:22,710
change to the protocol we had whole
civil war over it

3920
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:22,720
civil war over it
 

3921
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:25,510
civil war over it
and it was incredibly difficult to get

3922
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:25,520
and it was incredibly difficult to get
 

3923
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:28,309
and it was incredibly difficult to get
segwit activated in 2017

3924
01:06:28,309 --> 01:06:28,319
segwit activated in 2017
 

3925
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:30,549
segwit activated in 2017
uh and it took all this bricksmanship

3926
01:06:30,549 --> 01:06:30,559
uh and it took all this bricksmanship
 

3927
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:32,950
uh and it took all this bricksmanship
and threats and all these campaigns

3928
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:32,960
and threats and all these campaigns
 

3929
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,750
and threats and all these campaigns
and it was this whole thing luckily i

3930
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:35,760
and it was this whole thing luckily i
 

3931
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:36,069
and it was this whole thing luckily i
think

3932
01:06:36,069 --> 01:06:36,079
think
 

3933
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:37,430
think
things have quieted down and there's

3934
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:37,440
things have quieted down and there's
 

3935
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,270
things have quieted down and there's
much more consensus that schnorr top

3936
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:39,280
much more consensus that schnorr top
 

3937
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:40,230
much more consensus that schnorr top
rate is a good

3938
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:40,240
rate is a good
 

3939
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,069
rate is a good
change to bitcoin and everyone generally

3940
01:06:42,069 --> 01:06:42,079
change to bitcoin and everyone generally
 

3941
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:43,270
change to bitcoin and everyone generally
supports it

3942
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:43,280
supports it
 

3943
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,670
supports it
but everyone kind of has ptsd over the

3944
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:45,680
but everyone kind of has ptsd over the
 

3945
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:46,710
but everyone kind of has ptsd over the
last time

3946
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:46,720
last time
 

3947
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,950
last time
when we tried to change bitcoin and so

3948
01:06:48,950 --> 01:06:48,960
when we tried to change bitcoin and so
 

3949
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,789
when we tried to change bitcoin and so
we're sort of really dithering over how

3950
01:06:50,789 --> 01:06:50,799
we're sort of really dithering over how
 

3951
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:52,630
we're sort of really dithering over how
we actually want to implement it

3952
01:06:52,630 --> 01:06:52,640
we actually want to implement it
 

3953
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,710
we actually want to implement it
so it's taking forever because we're

3954
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:54,720
so it's taking forever because we're
 

3955
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,309
so it's taking forever because we're
trying to set the protocol

3956
01:06:56,309 --> 01:06:56,319
trying to set the protocol
 

3957
01:06:56,319 --> 01:06:58,950
trying to set the protocol
for how do you change bitcoin itself and

3958
01:06:58,950 --> 01:06:58,960
for how do you change bitcoin itself and
 

3959
01:06:58,960 --> 01:06:59,349
for how do you change bitcoin itself and
that

3960
01:06:59,349 --> 01:06:59,359
that
 

3961
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:00,549
that
all of our assumptions went out the

3962
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:00,559
all of our assumptions went out the
 

3963
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:02,549
all of our assumptions went out the
window last time so we're trying to

3964
01:07:02,549 --> 01:07:02,559
window last time so we're trying to
 

3965
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:04,069
window last time so we're trying to
reset and decide

3966
01:07:04,069 --> 01:07:04,079
reset and decide
 

3967
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:06,069
reset and decide
what is a legitimate way to institute a

3968
01:07:06,069 --> 01:07:06,079
what is a legitimate way to institute a
 

3969
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:07,829
what is a legitimate way to institute a
change to bitcoin

3970
01:07:07,829 --> 01:07:07,839
change to bitcoin
 

3971
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:09,270
change to bitcoin
so that's actually the big question

3972
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:09,280
so that's actually the big question
 

3973
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,190
so that's actually the big question
right now it's not should we implement

3974
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:11,200
right now it's not should we implement
 

3975
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,870
right now it's not should we implement
these changes we basically all agree

3976
01:07:12,870 --> 01:07:12,880
these changes we basically all agree
 

3977
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,430
these changes we basically all agree
that we should it's a meta question is

3978
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:15,440
that we should it's a meta question is
 

3979
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,109
that we should it's a meta question is
what's the valid way to implement new

3980
01:07:17,109 --> 01:07:17,119
what's the valid way to implement new
 

3981
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,710
what's the valid way to implement new
changes to bitcoin

3982
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:18,720
changes to bitcoin
 

3983
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,950
changes to bitcoin
what's a way that is scalable in the

3984
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:20,960
what's a way that is scalable in the
 

3985
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,710
what's a way that is scalable in the
long term and will last and people

3986
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:22,720
long term and will last and people
 

3987
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,230
long term and will last and people
consider credible

3988
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:24,240
consider credible
 

3989
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,990
consider credible
even if this one isn't controversial at

3990
01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:26,000
even if this one isn't controversial at
 

3991
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,670
even if this one isn't controversial at
all so that's

3992
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:27,680
all so that's
 

3993
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,910
all so that's
where we're at we're basically debating

3994
01:07:29,910 --> 01:07:29,920
where we're at we're basically debating
 

3995
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,589
where we're at we're basically debating
over how do we implement this change

3996
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:31,599
over how do we implement this change
 

3997
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:33,270
over how do we implement this change
that we all want

3998
01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:33,280
that we all want
 

3999
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:35,750
that we all want
if to get a feeling of how slow bitcoin

4000
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:35,760
if to get a feeling of how slow bitcoin
 

4001
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,309
if to get a feeling of how slow bitcoin
governance is and how deliberate it is

4002
01:07:38,309 --> 01:07:38,319
governance is and how deliberate it is
 

4003
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:40,630
governance is and how deliberate it is
everybody collectively wants the change

4004
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:40,640
everybody collectively wants the change
 

4005
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,549
everybody collectively wants the change
but we haven't fully agreed on how we're

4006
01:07:42,549 --> 01:07:42,559
but we haven't fully agreed on how we're
 

4007
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,390
but we haven't fully agreed on how we're
going to put it into bitcoin

4008
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:44,400
going to put it into bitcoin
 

4009
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,069
going to put it into bitcoin
so it's a classic sort of bitcoin

4010
01:07:46,069 --> 01:07:46,079
so it's a classic sort of bitcoin
 

4011
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:47,430
so it's a classic sort of bitcoin
situation

4012
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:47,440
situation
 

4013
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,589
situation
but what it is is i mean schnorr is an

4014
01:07:49,589 --> 01:07:49,599
but what it is is i mean schnorr is an
 

4015
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:51,430
but what it is is i mean schnorr is an
alternative signature scheme i think it

4016
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:51,440
alternative signature scheme i think it
 

4017
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,670
alternative signature scheme i think it
was encumbered by a patent

4018
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:53,680
was encumbered by a patent
 

4019
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:57,109
was encumbered by a patent
and it only just been unencumbered when

4020
01:07:57,109 --> 01:07:57,119
and it only just been unencumbered when
 

4021
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:59,829
and it only just been unencumbered when
satoshi created bitcoin i believe

4022
01:07:59,829 --> 01:07:59,839
satoshi created bitcoin i believe
 

4023
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:01,349
satoshi created bitcoin i believe
it's a better signature scheme than

4024
01:08:01,349 --> 01:08:01,359
it's a better signature scheme than
 

4025
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:03,349
it's a better signature scheme than
elliptic curves which is what

4026
01:08:03,349 --> 01:08:03,359
elliptic curves which is what
 

4027
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:05,750
elliptic curves which is what
uh big than ecdsa which is what bitcoin

4028
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:05,760
uh big than ecdsa which is what bitcoin
 

4029
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:07,029
uh big than ecdsa which is what bitcoin
uses

4030
01:08:07,029 --> 01:08:07,039
uses
 

4031
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:09,910
uses
and uh so it's been long enough that we

4032
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:09,920
and uh so it's been long enough that we
 

4033
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:10,950
and uh so it's been long enough that we
now trust it

4034
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:10,960
now trust it
 

4035
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,710
now trust it
you know kind of in cryptography it's

4036
01:08:12,710 --> 01:08:12,720
you know kind of in cryptography it's
 

4037
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,950
you know kind of in cryptography it's
meant to be lindy you know it's sort of

4038
01:08:14,950 --> 01:08:14,960
meant to be lindy you know it's sort of
 

4039
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,669
meant to be lindy you know it's sort of
you want to test it over time and then

4040
01:08:17,669 --> 01:08:17,679
you want to test it over time and then
 

4041
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:20,309
you want to test it over time and then
it's considered safe to use so schnorr

4042
01:08:20,309 --> 01:08:20,319
it's considered safe to use so schnorr
 

4043
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:22,229
it's considered safe to use so schnorr
has been around for long enough that

4044
01:08:22,229 --> 01:08:22,239
has been around for long enough that
 

4045
01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:24,470
has been around for long enough that
we've decided to rip out ecdsa

4046
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:24,480
we've decided to rip out ecdsa
 

4047
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,149
we've decided to rip out ecdsa
and insert snore which is just a

4048
01:08:26,149 --> 01:08:26,159
and insert snore which is just a
 

4049
01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:27,669
and insert snore which is just a
different signature scheme which is more

4050
01:08:27,669 --> 01:08:27,679
different signature scheme which is more
 

4051
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:28,789
different signature scheme which is more
efficient

4052
01:08:28,789 --> 01:08:28,799
efficient
 

4053
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:31,110
efficient
um and it has better properties like if

4054
01:08:31,110 --> 01:08:31,120
um and it has better properties like if
 

4055
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,470
um and it has better properties like if
you want to do a multi-signature

4056
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:32,480
you want to do a multi-signature
 

4057
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,669
you want to do a multi-signature
transaction where

4058
01:08:33,669 --> 01:08:33,679
transaction where
 

4059
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:36,789
transaction where
many people collectively sign in order

4060
01:08:36,789 --> 01:08:36,799
many people collectively sign in order
 

4061
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:38,630
many people collectively sign in order
permission a spend

4062
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:38,640
permission a spend
 

4063
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,349
permission a spend
that would be more efficient in a bytes

4064
01:08:41,349 --> 01:08:41,359
that would be more efficient in a bytes
 

4065
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:42,149
that would be more efficient in a bytes
sense

4066
01:08:42,149 --> 01:08:42,159
sense
 

4067
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:45,269
sense
than uh ecdsa for instance so it's

4068
01:08:45,269 --> 01:08:45,279
than uh ecdsa for instance so it's
 

4069
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:46,709
than uh ecdsa for instance so it's
pretty incremental

4070
01:08:46,709 --> 01:08:46,719
pretty incremental
 

4071
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:50,829
pretty incremental
and then toproot is all about

4072
01:08:50,829 --> 01:08:50,839

 

4073
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:53,349

having transactional conditions

4074
01:08:53,349 --> 01:08:53,359
having transactional conditions
 

4075
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:55,910
having transactional conditions
that are sort of withheld from final

4076
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:55,920
that are sort of withheld from final
 

4077
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,910
that are sort of withheld from final
entry onto the blockchain

4078
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:57,920
entry onto the blockchain
 

4079
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:01,829
entry onto the blockchain
um so it it's kind of a way to

4080
01:09:01,829 --> 01:09:01,839
um so it it's kind of a way to
 

4081
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:04,950
um so it it's kind of a way to
um have more private conditional

4082
01:09:04,950 --> 01:09:04,960
um have more private conditional
 

4083
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,510
um have more private conditional
transactions on bitcoin

4084
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:07,520
transactions on bitcoin
 

4085
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,110
transactions on bitcoin
so both of them i would say are

4086
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:09,120
so both of them i would say are
 

4087
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,709
so both of them i would say are
incremental uh

4088
01:09:10,709 --> 01:09:10,719
incremental uh
 

4089
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:13,749
incremental uh
changes is this an over-exaggeration

4090
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:13,759
changes is this an over-exaggeration
 

4091
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:15,430
changes is this an over-exaggeration
that channels approve might improve

4092
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:15,440
that channels approve might improve
 

4093
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:16,870
that channels approve might improve
privacy and scaling

4094
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:16,880
privacy and scaling
 

4095
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,390
privacy and scaling
which is it like at the high level

4096
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:18,400
which is it like at the high level
 

4097
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:19,910
which is it like at the high level
things that people mention

4098
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:19,920
things that people mention
 

4099
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,789
things that people mention
is that just like a dramatic way of of

4100
01:09:22,789 --> 01:09:22,799
is that just like a dramatic way of of
 

4101
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:23,749
is that just like a dramatic way of of
trying to frame

4102
01:09:23,749 --> 01:09:23,759
trying to frame
 

4103
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:26,470
trying to frame
uh what's fundamentally an incremental

4104
01:09:26,470 --> 01:09:26,480
uh what's fundamentally an incremental
 

4105
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:27,349
uh what's fundamentally an incremental
improvement

4106
01:09:27,349 --> 01:09:27,359
improvement
 

4107
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:29,349
improvement
yes but incremental is the word right

4108
01:09:29,349 --> 01:09:29,359
yes but incremental is the word right
 

4109
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:30,709
yes but incremental is the word right
it's not we're not going to get an order

4110
01:09:30,709 --> 01:09:30,719
it's not we're not going to get an order
 

4111
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:32,390
it's not we're not going to get an order
of magnitude enhancement to either

4112
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:32,400
of magnitude enhancement to either
 

4113
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:33,990
of magnitude enhancement to either
privacy or scaling but we

4114
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:34,000
privacy or scaling but we
 

4115
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,430
privacy or scaling but we
will get a considerable enhancement

4116
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:37,440
will get a considerable enhancement
 

4117
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,030
will get a considerable enhancement
but privacy and scaling are actually two

4118
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:39,040
but privacy and scaling are actually two
 

4119
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,950
but privacy and scaling are actually two
sides the same coin because

4120
01:09:40,950 --> 01:09:40,960
sides the same coin because
 

4121
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,789
sides the same coin because
you get more transactional privacy by

4122
01:09:42,789 --> 01:09:42,799
you get more transactional privacy by
 

4123
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:45,349
you get more transactional privacy by
removing data from the ledger

4124
01:09:45,349 --> 01:09:45,359
removing data from the ledger
 

4125
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:47,110
removing data from the ledger
so that there's less metadata for people

4126
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:47,120
so that there's less metadata for people
 

4127
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,950
so that there's less metadata for people
to surveil and analyze

4128
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:48,960
to surveil and analyze
 

4129
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,390
to surveil and analyze
and that's also you scale by compressing

4130
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:52,400
and that's also you scale by compressing
 

4131
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,030
and that's also you scale by compressing
and being really space efficient with

4132
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:55,040
and being really space efficient with
 

4133
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:55,910
and being really space efficient with
transactions

4134
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:55,920
transactions
 

4135
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:58,550
transactions
and the more parsimonious you are the

4136
01:09:58,550 --> 01:09:58,560
and the more parsimonious you are the
 

4137
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,990
and the more parsimonious you are the
more economically

4138
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:00,000
more economically
 

4139
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,910
more economically
dense each bite that everyone has to

4140
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:01,920
dense each bite that everyone has to
 

4141
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,750
dense each bite that everyone has to
retain on the ledger is

4142
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:03,760
retain on the ledger is
 

4143
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:06,709
retain on the ledger is
and so those are you know very closely

4144
01:10:06,709 --> 01:10:06,719
and so those are you know very closely
 

4145
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:09,189
and so those are you know very closely
allied concepts

4146
01:10:09,189 --> 01:10:09,199
allied concepts
 

4147
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:11,910
allied concepts
so do you mind if we go through some

4148
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:11,920
so do you mind if we go through some
 

4149
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,070
so do you mind if we go through some
potential criticisms

4150
01:10:14,070 --> 01:10:14,080
potential criticisms
 

4151
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:17,350
potential criticisms
of bitcoin totally yeah i've spent the

4152
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:17,360
of bitcoin totally yeah i've spent the
 

4153
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,870
of bitcoin totally yeah i've spent the
last five years

4154
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:18,880
last five years
 

4155
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,669
last five years
you know tackling these every day so are

4156
01:10:21,669 --> 01:10:21,679
you know tackling these every day so are
 

4157
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:21,990
you know tackling these every day so are
the

4158
01:10:21,990 --> 01:10:22,000
the
 

4159
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,550
the
the dice the same uh those two are the

4160
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:24,560
the dice the same uh those two are the
 

4161
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,270
the dice the same uh those two are the
same yeah

4162
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:25,280
same yeah
 

4163
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,190
same yeah
there are three editions so let's go

4164
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:27,200
there are three editions so let's go
 

4165
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,790
there are three editions so let's go
[Applause]

4166
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:28,800
[Applause]
 

4167
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,189
[Applause]
okay go with the dice what do we got oh

4168
01:10:31,189 --> 01:10:31,199
okay go with the dice what do we got oh
 

4169
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:32,149
okay go with the dice what do we got oh
silk road

4170
01:10:32,149 --> 01:10:32,159
silk road
 

4171
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:35,110
silk road
what does that mean road classic classic

4172
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:35,120
what does that mean road classic classic
 

4173
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:35,830
what does that mean road classic classic
situation

4174
01:10:35,830 --> 01:10:35,840
situation
 

4175
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,990
situation
so i mean that was the darknet

4176
01:10:37,990 --> 01:10:38,000
so i mean that was the darknet
 

4177
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,630
so i mean that was the darknet
marketplace set up by ross albrecht

4178
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:40,640
marketplace set up by ross albrecht
 

4179
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,550
marketplace set up by ross albrecht
in the early days of bitcoin that's one

4180
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:42,560
in the early days of bitcoin that's one
 

4181
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,350
in the early days of bitcoin that's one
of the first killer apps for bitcoin was

4182
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:45,360
of the first killer apps for bitcoin was
 

4183
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:45,910
of the first killer apps for bitcoin was
being

4184
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:45,920
being
 

4185
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:48,390
being
the payments network behind this darknet

4186
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:48,400
the payments network behind this darknet
 

4187
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,830
the payments network behind this darknet
marketplace

4188
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:49,840
marketplace
 

4189
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,830
marketplace
and uh you know where you'd go to buy

4190
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:51,840
and uh you know where you'd go to buy
 

4191
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,270
and uh you know where you'd go to buy
drugs and things

4192
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:53,280
drugs and things
 

4193
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,110
drugs and things
and so that became associated with

4194
01:10:55,110 --> 01:10:55,120
and so that became associated with
 

4195
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,550
and so that became associated with
bitcoin if you remember the press

4196
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:56,560
bitcoin if you remember the press
 

4197
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,470
bitcoin if you remember the press
coverage from back then

4198
01:10:58,470 --> 01:10:58,480
coverage from back then
 

4199
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,390
coverage from back then
but over time that faded and it became

4200
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:00,400
but over time that faded and it became
 

4201
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,830
but over time that faded and it became
less of a critique but

4202
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:01,840
less of a critique but
 

4203
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,149
less of a critique but
so like the the critique is that uh

4204
01:11:04,149 --> 01:11:04,159
so like the the critique is that uh
 

4205
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:05,430
so like the the critique is that uh
bitcoin is something you

4206
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:05,440
bitcoin is something you
 

4207
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:08,470
bitcoin is something you
would use for illegal activity for drugs

4208
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:08,480
would use for illegal activity for drugs
 

4209
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,470
would use for illegal activity for drugs
for crimes all those kinds of things

4210
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:10,480
for crimes all those kinds of things
 

4211
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,470
for crimes all those kinds of things
as opposed to for any kind of legitimate

4212
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:12,480
as opposed to for any kind of legitimate
 

4213
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,149
as opposed to for any kind of legitimate

4214
01:11:14,149 --> 01:11:14,159

4215
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:16,070

01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:16,080

4221
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,550
and the vast vast majority of it is you
know completely legitimate it's just a

know completely legitimate it's just a

4241
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:47,430
yeah in in a genius way has put together
maybe we could do a couple more

01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:53,110
oh said that it was satoshi something
satoshi coins satoshi coins we we

4246
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:53,120
satoshi coins satoshi coins we we
 

4247
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,830
satoshi coins satoshi coins we we
touched on that early in the episode

4248
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:55,840
touched on that early in the episode
 

4249
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,870
touched on that early in the episode
what if satoshi returns and sells

4250
01:11:58,870 --> 01:11:58,880
what if satoshi returns and sells
 

4251
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,910
what if satoshi returns and sells
all of their coins so we don't know for

4252
01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:01,920
all of their coins so we don't know for
 

4253
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,830
all of their coins so we don't know for
sure how many coins satoshi actually

4254
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:03,840
sure how many coins satoshi actually
 

4255
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,229
sure how many coins satoshi actually
mined or produced because there's a

4256
01:12:06,229 --> 01:12:06,239
mined or produced because there's a
 

4257
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:08,870
mined or produced because there's a
degree of probabilistic analysis

4258
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:08,880
degree of probabilistic analysis
 

4259
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,229
degree of probabilistic analysis
that you would do there's a few

4260
01:12:12,229 --> 01:12:12,239
that you would do there's a few
 

4261
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:15,669
that you would do there's a few
few thousand blocks that were mined by

4262
01:12:15,669 --> 01:12:15,679
few thousand blocks that were mined by
 

4263
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:17,750
few thousand blocks that were mined by
what we think is a single entity in sort

4264
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:17,760
what we think is a single entity in sort
 

4265
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,110
what we think is a single entity in sort
of 2009

4266
01:12:19,110 --> 01:12:19,120
of 2009
 

4267
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:20,870
of 2009
and so if you add them all up you get to

4268
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:20,880
and so if you add them all up you get to
 

4269
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,390
and so if you add them all up you get to
about a million so people think that

4270
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:22,400
about a million so people think that
 

4271
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:23,430
about a million so people think that
satoshi

4272
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:23,440
satoshi
 

4273
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,030
satoshi
mined a million coins and then they're

4274
01:12:25,030 --> 01:12:25,040
mined a million coins and then they're
 

4275
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,669
mined a million coins and then they're
worried that satoshi would return and

4276
01:12:27,669 --> 01:12:27,679
worried that satoshi would return and
 

4277
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:30,470
worried that satoshi would return and
market sell all the coins

4278
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:30,480
market sell all the coins
 

4279
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:33,510
market sell all the coins
thus crushing the price of bitcoin

4280
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:33,520
thus crushing the price of bitcoin
 

4281
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,870
thus crushing the price of bitcoin
so looking at some of these uh

4282
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:36,880
so looking at some of these uh
 

4283
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:40,390
so looking at some of these uh
no ceo i think we touch we've already

4284
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:40,400
no ceo i think we touch we've already
 

4285
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,910
no ceo i think we touch we've already
hit on

4286
01:12:41,910 --> 01:12:41,920
hit on
 

4287
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:44,950
hit on
the dice no merchants that that's

4288
01:12:44,950 --> 01:12:44,960
the dice no merchants that that's
 

4289
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:49,189
the dice no merchants that that's
no longer true about that yeah

4290
01:12:49,189 --> 01:12:49,199

 

4291
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:51,590

there's a scalability one and i think

4292
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:51,600
there's a scalability one and i think
 

4293
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,510
there's a scalability one and i think
that one has addressed

4294
01:12:53,510 --> 01:12:53,520
that one has addressed
 

4295
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:54,950
that one has addressed
the idea that you're mentioning with the

4296
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:54,960
the idea that you're mentioning with the
 

4297
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,790
the idea that you're mentioning with the
block size debates and the lightning

4298
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:56,800
block size debates and the lightning
 

4299
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,229
block size debates and the lightning
network that

4300
01:12:58,229 --> 01:12:58,239
network that
 

4301
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:00,390
network that
by adding extra layers on top you can

4302
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:00,400
by adding extra layers on top you can
 

4303
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,310
by adding extra layers on top you can
you can achieve scalability

4304
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:02,320
you can achieve scalability
 

4305
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:06,229
you can achieve scalability
that's my vision that's my theory um

4306
01:13:06,229 --> 01:13:06,239
that's my vision that's my theory um
 

4307
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:07,750
that's my vision that's my theory um
and you know you can do it in a

4308
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:07,760
and you know you can do it in a
 

4309
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,590
and you know you can do it in a
permissionless and a permissioned way

4310
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:09,600
permissionless and a permissioned way
 

4311
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:10,630
permissionless and a permissioned way
like coinbase

4312
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:10,640
like coinbase
 

4313
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,870
like coinbase
is a big bitcoin exchange they provide

4314
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:12,880
is a big bitcoin exchange they provide
 

4315
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:13,910
is a big bitcoin exchange they provide
scalability

4316
01:13:13,910 --> 01:13:13,920
scalability
 

4317
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,310
scalability
they're a financial institution you know

4318
01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:16,320
they're a financial institution you know
 

4319
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,270
they're a financial institution you know
you can settle up

4320
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:17,280
you can settle up
 

4321
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,510
you can settle up
internally on their own database and

4322
01:13:19,510 --> 01:13:19,520
internally on their own database and
 

4323
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,030
internally on their own database and
then you know periodically settle to

4324
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:21,040
then you know periodically settle to
 

4325
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,149
then you know periodically settle to
bitcoin so

4326
01:13:22,149 --> 01:13:22,159
bitcoin so
 

4327
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:24,470
bitcoin so
oh so they don't uh they do something

4328
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:24,480
oh so they don't uh they do something
 

4329
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,470
oh so they don't uh they do something
like the lighting network internally so

4330
01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:26,480
like the lighting network internally so
 

4331
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:27,830
like the lighting network internally so
something like this the middle kind of

4332
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:27,840
something like this the middle kind of
 

4333
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,750
something like this the middle kind of
mechanism well honestly i'm not sure

4334
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:29,760
mechanism well honestly i'm not sure
 

4335
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,189
mechanism well honestly i'm not sure
exactly how it works they might have

4336
01:13:31,189 --> 01:13:31,199
exactly how it works they might have
 

4337
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:31,590
exactly how it works they might have
that

4338
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:31,600
that
 

4339
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,070
that
built in but just generally speaking

4340
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:34,080
built in but just generally speaking
 

4341
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,350
built in but just generally speaking
institutional scaling

4342
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:35,360
institutional scaling
 

4343
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:38,470
institutional scaling
is a model for scaling right where you

4344
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:38,480
is a model for scaling right where you
 

4345
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:39,030
is a model for scaling right where you
could have

4346
01:13:39,030 --> 01:13:39,040
could have
 

4347
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,870
could have
banks holding bitcoin and they issue

4348
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:40,880
banks holding bitcoin and they issue
 

4349
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,030
banks holding bitcoin and they issue
notes against bitcoin and

4350
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:43,040
notes against bitcoin and
 

4351
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,030
notes against bitcoin and
those are your payments and then the

4352
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:45,040
those are your payments and then the
 

4353
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:46,709
those are your payments and then the
base layers the settlement

4354
01:13:46,709 --> 01:13:46,719
base layers the settlement
 

4355
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:49,110
base layers the settlement
layer i think that's what you're getting

4356
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:49,120
layer i think that's what you're getting
 

4357
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,550
layer i think that's what you're getting
with the

4358
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:50,560
with the
 

4359
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:53,189
with the
boiling oceans is this is like the

4360
01:13:53,189 --> 01:13:53,199
boiling oceans is this is like the
 

4361
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:53,830
boiling oceans is this is like the
impact

4362
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:53,840
impact
 

4363
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:57,189
impact
on uh weather and the environment and

4364
01:13:57,189 --> 01:13:57,199
on uh weather and the environment and
 

4365
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:58,830
on uh weather and the environment and
the environment

4366
01:13:58,830 --> 01:13:58,840
the environment
 

4367
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:02,229
the environment
so uh you know that is a concern that

4368
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:02,239
so uh you know that is a concern that
 

4369
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:03,990
so uh you know that is a concern that
people have in terms of like the proof

4370
01:14:03,990 --> 01:14:04,000
people have in terms of like the proof
 

4371
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,510
people have in terms of like the proof
of work requires that there's

4372
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:05,520
of work requires that there's
 

4373
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,430
of work requires that there's
a lot of computational resources and uh

4374
01:14:07,430 --> 01:14:07,440
a lot of computational resources and uh
 

4375
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:08,790
a lot of computational resources and uh
being used and that

4376
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:08,800
being used and that
 

4377
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,669
being used and that
requires a lot of energy and like some

4378
01:14:11,669 --> 01:14:11,679
requires a lot of energy and like some
 

4379
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:13,350
requires a lot of energy and like some
large percentage of the world's energy

4380
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:13,360
large percentage of the world's energy
 

4381
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,310
large percentage of the world's energy
is used to

4382
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:14,320
is used to
 

4383
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:17,430
is used to
to mine bitcoin what's how how would you

4384
01:14:17,430 --> 01:14:17,440
to mine bitcoin what's how how would you
 

4385
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:18,790
to mine bitcoin what's how how would you
respond to that criticism

4386
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:18,800
respond to that criticism
 

4387
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,149
respond to that criticism
yeah i mean that's been the loudest

4388
01:14:20,149 --> 01:14:20,159
yeah i mean that's been the loudest
 

4389
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:21,990
yeah i mean that's been the loudest
critique of bitcoin this year

4390
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:22,000
critique of bitcoin this year
 

4391
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,229
critique of bitcoin this year
in the press this year really yeah so i

4392
01:14:24,229 --> 01:14:24,239
in the press this year really yeah so i
 

4393
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:25,910
in the press this year really yeah so i
mean it's not like a new

4394
01:14:25,910 --> 01:14:25,920
mean it's not like a new
 

4395
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,149
mean it's not like a new
criticism but bitcoin is consuming more

4396
01:14:28,149 --> 01:14:28,159
criticism but bitcoin is consuming more
 

4397
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:29,350
criticism but bitcoin is consuming more
energy than ever

4398
01:14:29,350 --> 01:14:29,360
energy than ever
 

4399
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:32,790
energy than ever
so as the price rises the electricity

4400
01:14:32,790 --> 01:14:32,800
so as the price rises the electricity
 

4401
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,510
so as the price rises the electricity
consumption rises and so

4402
01:14:35,510 --> 01:14:35,520
consumption rises and so
 

4403
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:38,870
consumption rises and so
we've we've heard renewed uh

4404
01:14:38,870 --> 01:14:38,880
we've we've heard renewed uh
 

4405
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,030
we've we've heard renewed uh
you know bellyaching over this for sure

4406
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:41,040
you know bellyaching over this for sure
 

4407
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:42,310
you know bellyaching over this for sure
i mean it's

4408
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:42,320
i mean it's
 

4409
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,149
i mean it's
if you don't believe that bitcoin is

4410
01:14:44,149 --> 01:14:44,159
if you don't believe that bitcoin is
 

4411
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:45,830
if you don't believe that bitcoin is
useful then you're inclined to think

4412
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:45,840
useful then you're inclined to think
 

4413
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,590
useful then you're inclined to think
that all the energy consumption is a

4414
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:47,600
that all the energy consumption is a
 

4415
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:48,790
that all the energy consumption is a
waste

4416
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:48,800
waste
 

4417
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,910
waste
so that's you know it's it's it's

4418
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:51,920
so that's you know it's it's it's
 

4419
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,750
so that's you know it's it's it's
something that's sort of unrebuttable

4420
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:53,760
something that's sort of unrebuttable
 

4421
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:56,630
something that's sort of unrebuttable
if you fundamentally contest the

4422
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:56,640
if you fundamentally contest the
 

4423
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,550
if you fundamentally contest the
validity of the bitcoin system

4424
01:14:58,550 --> 01:14:58,560
validity of the bitcoin system
 

4425
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:02,229
validity of the bitcoin system
so if bitcoin is like a thing

4426
01:15:02,229 --> 01:15:02,239
so if bitcoin is like a thing
 

4427
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:05,270
so if bitcoin is like a thing
that will take over it will become like

4428
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:05,280
that will take over it will become like
 

4429
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:06,310
that will take over it will become like
the main

4430
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:06,320
the main
 

4431
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:09,669
the main
mechanism of financial transactions

4432
01:15:09,669 --> 01:15:09,679
mechanism of financial transactions
 

4433
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:12,390
mechanism of financial transactions
or transactions period in the world then

4434
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:12,400
or transactions period in the world then
 

4435
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:14,390
or transactions period in the world then
you say well the cost of energy use is

4436
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:14,400
you say well the cost of energy use is
 

4437
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,830
you say well the cost of energy use is
actually quite low relative to the

4438
01:15:15,830 --> 01:15:15,840
actually quite low relative to the
 

4439
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,030
actually quite low relative to the
benefit it provides

4440
01:15:17,030 --> 01:15:17,040
benefit it provides
 

4441
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,430
benefit it provides
if you think it's not going to be if

4442
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:19,440
if you think it's not going to be if
 

4443
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:20,470
if you think it's not going to be if
it's just a

4444
01:15:20,470 --> 01:15:20,480
it's just a
 

4445
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:23,750
it's just a
volatile uh way to

4446
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:23,760
volatile uh way to
 

4447
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,430
volatile uh way to
uh to make a little money in the short

4448
01:15:25,430 --> 01:15:25,440
uh to make a little money in the short
 

4449
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,750
uh to make a little money in the short
term then you see the energy used as

4450
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:27,760
term then you see the energy used as
 

4451
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,830
term then you see the energy used as
really wasteful that's totally spurious

4452
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:29,840
really wasteful that's totally spurious
 

4453
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,270
really wasteful that's totally spurious
yeah yeah so

4454
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:31,280
yeah yeah so
 

4455
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,669
yeah yeah so
so then there's no really response i

4456
01:15:33,669 --> 01:15:33,679
so then there's no really response i
 

4457
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:34,870
so then there's no really response i
suppose

4458
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:34,880
suppose
 

4459
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,350
suppose
that's so i can totally you know get

4460
01:15:37,350 --> 01:15:37,360
that's so i can totally you know get
 

4461
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,430
that's so i can totally you know get
into the details of bitcoin synergy mix

4462
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:39,440
into the details of bitcoin synergy mix
 

4463
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:40,630
into the details of bitcoin synergy mix
and things like that but

4464
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:40,640
and things like that but
 

4465
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,149
and things like that but
that's like at a high level what the

4466
01:15:42,149 --> 01:15:42,159
that's like at a high level what the
 

4467
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:44,470
that's like at a high level what the
debate is it's this normative question

4468
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:44,480
debate is it's this normative question
 

4469
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:46,790
debate is it's this normative question
like does bitcoin have an entitlement to

4470
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:46,800
like does bitcoin have an entitlement to
 

4471
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,110
like does bitcoin have an entitlement to
consume any of the world's resources

4472
01:15:49,110 --> 01:15:49,120
consume any of the world's resources
 

4473
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:50,709
consume any of the world's resources
and that's actually where the debate

4474
01:15:50,709 --> 01:15:50,719
and that's actually where the debate
 

4475
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:53,270
and that's actually where the debate
should end much of the time

4476
01:15:53,270 --> 01:15:53,280
should end much of the time
 

4477
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,750
should end much of the time
because a lot of people fundamentally

4478
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:55,760
because a lot of people fundamentally
 

4479
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:56,550
because a lot of people fundamentally
dispute

4480
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:56,560
dispute
 

4481
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,630
dispute
the the validity or usefulness of

4482
01:15:58,630 --> 01:15:58,640
the the validity or usefulness of
 

4483
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:00,070
the the validity or usefulness of
bitcoin as a system

4484
01:16:00,070 --> 01:16:00,080
bitcoin as a system
 

4485
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:02,470
bitcoin as a system
and so of course they're gonna consider

4486
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:02,480
and so of course they're gonna consider
 

4487
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:05,110
and so of course they're gonna consider
the energy usage illegitimate

4488
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:05,120
the energy usage illegitimate
 

4489
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,030
the energy usage illegitimate
now there's a lot of mitigating factors

4490
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:07,040
now there's a lot of mitigating factors
 

4491
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,669
now there's a lot of mitigating factors
if you you know think the bitcoin is a

4492
01:16:09,669 --> 01:16:09,679
if you you know think the bitcoin is a
 

4493
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:12,229
if you you know think the bitcoin is a
potentially useful system which is

4494
01:16:12,229 --> 01:16:12,239
potentially useful system which is
 

4495
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:13,350
potentially useful system which is
bitcoin

4496
01:16:13,350 --> 01:16:13,360
bitcoin
 

4497
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:16,070
bitcoin
consumes energy in a very peculiar way

4498
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:16,080
consumes energy in a very peculiar way
 

4499
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:17,189
consumes energy in a very peculiar way
which virtually no

4500
01:16:17,189 --> 01:16:17,199
which virtually no
 

4501
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:20,149
which virtually no
other industry does which is that

4502
01:16:20,149 --> 01:16:20,159
other industry does which is that
 

4503
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:20,870
other industry does which is that
bitcoin

4504
01:16:20,870 --> 01:16:20,880
bitcoin
 

4505
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:24,229
bitcoin
is a geography independent buyer of

4506
01:16:24,229 --> 01:16:24,239
is a geography independent buyer of
 

4507
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:25,189
is a geography independent buyer of
energy

4508
01:16:25,189 --> 01:16:25,199
energy
 

4509
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:28,390
energy
which is not how we humans

4510
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:28,400
which is not how we humans
 

4511
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,070
which is not how we humans
typically consume energy like we need

4512
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:30,080
typically consume energy like we need
 

4513
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:32,390
typically consume energy like we need
energy to be produced near to population

4514
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:32,400
energy to be produced near to population
 

4515
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:33,350
energy to be produced near to population
centers

4516
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:33,360
centers
 

4517
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:36,070
centers
and we need it to be produced at the you

4518
01:16:36,070 --> 01:16:36,080
and we need it to be produced at the you
 

4519
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,910
and we need it to be produced at the you
know corresponding to the peaks and

4520
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:37,920
know corresponding to the peaks and
 

4521
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,590
know corresponding to the peaks and
troughs of our consumption

4522
01:16:39,590 --> 01:16:39,600
troughs of our consumption
 

4523
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,910
troughs of our consumption
right because we have to 100 match the

4524
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:41,920
right because we have to 100 match the
 

4525
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,990
right because we have to 100 match the
demand and the supply at all times

4526
01:16:43,990 --> 01:16:44,000
demand and the supply at all times
 

4527
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,910
demand and the supply at all times
right otherwise we have blackouts so

4528
01:16:47,910 --> 01:16:47,920
right otherwise we have blackouts so
 

4529
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:49,590
right otherwise we have blackouts so
bitcoin doesn't care

4530
01:16:49,590 --> 01:16:49,600
bitcoin doesn't care
 

4531
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:52,630
bitcoin doesn't care
about any of that it just buys energy on

4532
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:52,640
about any of that it just buys energy on
 

4533
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,229
about any of that it just buys energy on
a constant basis

4534
01:16:54,229 --> 01:16:54,239
a constant basis
 

4535
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:56,149
a constant basis
and so it's you know indifferent to

4536
01:16:56,149 --> 01:16:56,159
and so it's you know indifferent to
 

4537
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:57,590
and so it's you know indifferent to
where it's being produced

4538
01:16:57,590 --> 01:16:57,600
where it's being produced
 

4539
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,310
where it's being produced
and so the the consequence of all that

4540
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:00,320
and so the the consequence of all that
 

4541
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,189
and so the the consequence of all that
is that

4542
01:17:01,189 --> 01:17:01,199
is that
 

4543
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:03,750
is that
bitcoin will buy energy that's otherwise

4544
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:03,760
bitcoin will buy energy that's otherwise
 

4545
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:04,709
bitcoin will buy energy that's otherwise
being wasted

4546
01:17:04,709 --> 01:17:04,719
being wasted
 

4547
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:07,350
being wasted
basically so it will buy so-called

4548
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:07,360
basically so it will buy so-called
 

4549
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,070
basically so it will buy so-called
stranded

4550
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:08,080
stranded
 

4551
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,390
stranded
energy assets that would not make it to

4552
01:17:10,390 --> 01:17:10,400
energy assets that would not make it to
 

4553
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,630
energy assets that would not make it to
a population center and in fact most

4554
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:12,640
a population center and in fact most
 

4555
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:16,709
a population center and in fact most
energy produced is ultimately does not

4556
01:17:16,709 --> 01:17:16,719
energy produced is ultimately does not
 

4557
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:17,590
energy produced is ultimately does not
sort of make it

4558
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:17,600
sort of make it
 

4559
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:20,470
sort of make it
to you know your your socket in your

4560
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:20,480
to you know your your socket in your
 

4561
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:21,430
to you know your your socket in your
wall

4562
01:17:21,430 --> 01:17:21,440
wall
 

4563
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:24,229
wall
um and so this is why so much bitcoin is

4564
01:17:24,229 --> 01:17:24,239
um and so this is why so much bitcoin is
 

4565
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:25,910
um and so this is why so much bitcoin is
mine in china for instance

4566
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:25,920
mine in china for instance
 

4567
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,910
mine in china for instance
it's not because you know chinese

4568
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:27,920
it's not because you know chinese
 

4569
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,669
it's not because you know chinese
industrialists had a special affinity

4570
01:17:29,669 --> 01:17:29,679
industrialists had a special affinity
 

4571
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:30,790
industrialists had a special affinity
for bitcoin

4572
01:17:30,790 --> 01:17:30,800
for bitcoin
 

4573
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:33,350
for bitcoin
it's because the chinese grid had a

4574
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:33,360
it's because the chinese grid had a
 

4575
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:34,870
it's because the chinese grid had a
massive overabundance

4576
01:17:34,870 --> 01:17:34,880
massive overabundance
 

4577
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,030
massive overabundance
of energy in particularly in four

4578
01:17:37,030 --> 01:17:37,040
of energy in particularly in four
 

4579
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,110
of energy in particularly in four
provinces sichuan yunnan

4580
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:39,120
provinces sichuan yunnan
 

4581
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:42,149
provinces sichuan yunnan
inner mongolia and zhang jing so in

4582
01:17:42,149 --> 01:17:42,159
inner mongolia and zhang jing so in
 

4583
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:44,470
inner mongolia and zhang jing so in
those four provinces those are all

4584
01:17:44,470 --> 01:17:44,480
those four provinces those are all
 

4585
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,229
those four provinces those are all
pretty distant from major population

4586
01:17:46,229 --> 01:17:46,239
pretty distant from major population
 

4587
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:47,750
pretty distant from major population
centers

4588
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:47,760
centers
 

4589
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,830
centers
so because of that you can't really

4590
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:49,840
so because of that you can't really
 

4591
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:52,070
so because of that you can't really
transport the energy that easily and so

4592
01:17:52,070 --> 01:17:52,080
transport the energy that easily and so
 

4593
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,630
transport the energy that easily and so
huge amounts of energy are curtailed or

4594
01:17:54,630 --> 01:17:54,640
huge amounts of energy are curtailed or
 

4595
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:57,030
huge amounts of energy are curtailed or
basically wasted in all these provinces

4596
01:17:57,030 --> 01:17:57,040
basically wasted in all these provinces
 

4597
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,750
basically wasted in all these provinces
and so miners set up shop there because

4598
01:17:59,750 --> 01:17:59,760
and so miners set up shop there because
 

4599
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,590
and so miners set up shop there because
they could mine bitcoin with the excess

4600
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:01,600
they could mine bitcoin with the excess
 

4601
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:03,110
they could mine bitcoin with the excess
energy they could monetize this thing

4602
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:03,120
energy they could monetize this thing
 

4603
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:05,430
energy they could monetize this thing
that otherwise was going to go to waste

4604
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:05,440
that otherwise was going to go to waste
 

4605
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07,270
that otherwise was going to go to waste
so you know there's things like that

4606
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:07,280
so you know there's things like that
 

4607
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,110
so you know there's things like that
which you know

4608
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:09,120
which you know
 

4609
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,669
which you know
i think mitigate the the reality bitcoin

4610
01:18:11,669 --> 01:18:11,679
i think mitigate the the reality bitcoin
 

4611
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:12,310
i think mitigate the the reality bitcoin
is not really

4612
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:12,320
is not really
 

4613
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:15,590
is not really
rival um with our consumption of

4614
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:15,600
rival um with our consumption of
 

4615
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,830
rival um with our consumption of
electricity it's not depriving anyone of

4616
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:17,840
electricity it's not depriving anyone of
 

4617
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,510
electricity it's not depriving anyone of
electricity it's mostly

4618
01:18:19,510 --> 01:18:19,520
electricity it's mostly
 

4619
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,990
electricity it's mostly
these stranded assets that are going

4620
01:18:21,990 --> 01:18:22,000
these stranded assets that are going
 

4621
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,390
these stranded assets that are going
into supporting the bitcoin network

4622
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:24,400
into supporting the bitcoin network
 

4623
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:27,110
into supporting the bitcoin network
so maybe let's do a last one since you

4624
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:27,120
so maybe let's do a last one since you
 

4625
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:29,350
so maybe let's do a last one since you
mentioned china says china control

4626
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:29,360
mentioned china says china control
 

4627
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:32,550
mentioned china says china control
so so much mining is happening in china

4628
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:32,560
so so much mining is happening in china
 

4629
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:35,590
so so much mining is happening in china
how do we not uh how do we prevent

4630
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:35,600
how do we not uh how do we prevent
 

4631
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,870
how do we not uh how do we prevent
nation states from controlling much of

4632
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:38,880
nation states from controlling much of
 

4633
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,510
nation states from controlling much of
bitcoin yeah that's the flip side of a

4634
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:41,520
bitcoin yeah that's the flip side of a
 

4635
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:41,990
bitcoin yeah that's the flip side of a
large

4636
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:42,000
large
 

4637
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,590
large
portion of the blocks being mined in

4638
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:43,600
portion of the blocks being mined in
 

4639
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,590
portion of the blocks being mined in
china due to this energy feature which i

4640
01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:45,600
china due to this energy feature which i
 

4641
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:46,470
china due to this energy feature which i
discussed

4642
01:18:46,470 --> 01:18:46,480
discussed
 

4643
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,790
discussed
which is that there's a lot of chinese

4644
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:48,800
which is that there's a lot of chinese
 

4645
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,390
which is that there's a lot of chinese
miners for sure

4646
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:50,400
miners for sure
 

4647
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:53,590
miners for sure
now the question ultimately is what

4648
01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:53,600
now the question ultimately is what
 

4649
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,750
now the question ultimately is what
degree of control do miners have over

4650
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:55,760
degree of control do miners have over
 

4651
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:56,790
degree of control do miners have over
the bitcoin system

4652
01:18:56,790 --> 01:18:56,800
the bitcoin system
 

4653
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,590
the bitcoin system
right and that was part of the block

4654
01:18:59,590 --> 01:18:59,600
right and that was part of the block
 

4655
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:00,229
right and that was part of the block
size

4656
01:19:00,229 --> 01:19:00,239
size
 

4657
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:03,910
size
debate i mean the miners when we

4658
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:03,920
debate i mean the miners when we
 

4659
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,590
debate i mean the miners when we
implemented sub-graded witness in in

4660
01:19:05,590 --> 01:19:05,600
implemented sub-graded witness in in
 

4661
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,189
implemented sub-graded witness in in
2017 the miners just

4662
01:19:07,189 --> 01:19:07,199
2017 the miners just
 

4663
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:09,430
2017 the miners just
didn't want to do it eventually the

4664
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:09,440
didn't want to do it eventually the
 

4665
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:12,229
didn't want to do it eventually the
users the regular folks running nodes

4666
01:19:12,229 --> 01:19:12,239
users the regular folks running nodes
 

4667
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:15,350
users the regular folks running nodes
rebelled and basically said look we're

4668
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:15,360
rebelled and basically said look we're
 

4669
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:16,630
rebelled and basically said look we're
going to implement this whether or not

4670
01:19:16,630 --> 01:19:16,640
going to implement this whether or not
 

4671
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:17,669
going to implement this whether or not
you do it

4672
01:19:17,669 --> 01:19:17,679
you do it
 

4673
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:19,510
you do it
and it was a threat to the value of

4674
01:19:19,510 --> 01:19:19,520
and it was a threat to the value of
 

4675
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:20,950
and it was a threat to the value of
bitcoin because if

4676
01:19:20,950 --> 01:19:20,960
bitcoin because if
 

4677
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,229
bitcoin because if
this threat had gone through it could

4678
01:19:22,229 --> 01:19:22,239
this threat had gone through it could
 

4679
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:23,750
this threat had gone through it could
have split bitcoin and it had been

4680
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:23,760
have split bitcoin and it had been
 

4681
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:24,950
have split bitcoin and it had been
really messy

4682
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:24,960
really messy
 

4683
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,149
really messy
so the miners sort of capitulated so

4684
01:19:28,149 --> 01:19:28,159
so the miners sort of capitulated so
 

4685
01:19:28,159 --> 01:19:30,550
so the miners sort of capitulated so
i think the current consensus is that

4686
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:30,560
i think the current consensus is that
 

4687
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:32,709
i think the current consensus is that
miners do not have unilateral control

4688
01:19:32,709 --> 01:19:32,719
miners do not have unilateral control
 

4689
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:34,470
miners do not have unilateral control
over bitcoin

4690
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:34,480
over bitcoin
 

4691
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,149
over bitcoin
and the governance is more poised

4692
01:19:36,149 --> 01:19:36,159
and the governance is more poised
 

4693
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:37,830
and the governance is more poised
between people that run nodes

4694
01:19:37,830 --> 01:19:37,840
between people that run nodes
 

4695
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,669
between people that run nodes
developers and miners it's sort of a

4696
01:19:39,669 --> 01:19:39,679
developers and miners it's sort of a
 

4697
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:41,030
developers and miners it's sort of a
triumvirate

4698
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:41,040
triumvirate
 

4699
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,430
triumvirate
where neither of them has you know total

4700
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:43,440
where neither of them has you know total
 

4701
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,709
where neither of them has you know total
control

4702
01:19:44,709 --> 01:19:44,719
control
 

4703
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:46,630
control
uh so that's my current model for

4704
01:19:46,630 --> 01:19:46,640
uh so that's my current model for
 

4705
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:48,630
uh so that's my current model for
controlling bitcoin

4706
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:48,640
controlling bitcoin
 

4707
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:51,270
controlling bitcoin
i think if you asked a minor they would

4708
01:19:51,270 --> 01:19:51,280
i think if you asked a minor they would
 

4709
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:53,030
i think if you asked a minor they would
tell you they didn't feel that they had

4710
01:19:53,030 --> 01:19:53,040
tell you they didn't feel that they had
 

4711
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,950
tell you they didn't feel that they had
sort of unilateral control over bitcoin

4712
01:19:54,950 --> 01:19:54,960
sort of unilateral control over bitcoin
 

4713
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,630
sort of unilateral control over bitcoin
either

4714
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:56,640
either
 

4715
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,550
either
almost as a thought experiment can i ask

4716
01:19:58,550 --> 01:19:58,560
almost as a thought experiment can i ask
 

4717
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,870
almost as a thought experiment can i ask
you to think about

4718
01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:00,880
you to think about
 

4719
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:03,350
you to think about
if you're if some of your predictions

4720
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:03,360
if you're if some of your predictions
 

4721
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:04,630
if you're if some of your predictions
some of your analysis

4722
01:20:04,630 --> 01:20:04,640
some of your analysis
 

4723
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,470
some of your analysis
some of your understanding of bitcoin is

4724
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:06,480
some of your understanding of bitcoin is
 

4725
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,070
some of your understanding of bitcoin is
wrong

4726
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:08,080
wrong
 

4727
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,550
wrong
in in the following sense where it will

4728
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:10,560
in in the following sense where it will
 

4729
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,070
in in the following sense where it will
not have the impact

4730
01:20:12,070 --> 01:20:12,080
not have the impact
 

4731
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:15,189
not have the impact
uh that you have a

4732
01:20:15,189 --> 01:20:15,199
uh that you have a
 

4733
01:20:15,199 --> 01:20:17,990
uh that you have a
vision for it that you will not have the

4734
01:20:17,990 --> 01:20:18,000
vision for it that you will not have the
 

4735
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,830
vision for it that you will not have the
scale of impact and perhaps in terms of

4736
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:19,840
scale of impact and perhaps in terms of
 

4737
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,910
scale of impact and perhaps in terms of
value will go to zero to something very

4738
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:21,920
value will go to zero to something very
 

4739
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,830
value will go to zero to something very
low and other cryptocurrency or other

4740
01:20:23,830 --> 01:20:23,840
low and other cryptocurrency or other
 

4741
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,110
low and other cryptocurrency or other
financial systems will

4742
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:25,120
financial systems will
 

4743
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:28,229
financial systems will
overtake it what would be the reason

4744
01:20:28,229 --> 01:20:28,239
overtake it what would be the reason
 

4745
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:31,030
overtake it what would be the reason
for that in your mind like why might you

4746
01:20:31,030 --> 01:20:31,040
for that in your mind like why might you
 

4747
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:31,990
for that in your mind like why might you
be

4748
01:20:31,990 --> 01:20:32,000
be
 

4749
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,709
be
wrong if you look back at it yeah in the

4750
01:20:34,709 --> 01:20:34,719
wrong if you look back at it yeah in the
 

4751
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:36,149
wrong if you look back at it yeah in the
future

4752
01:20:36,149 --> 01:20:36,159
future
 

4753
01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:37,750
future
what did you not understand about

4754
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:37,760
what did you not understand about
 

4755
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,590
what did you not understand about
bitcoin that uh

4756
01:20:39,590 --> 01:20:39,600
bitcoin that uh
 

4757
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,470
bitcoin that uh
will result in that yeah that's a great

4758
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:42,480
will result in that yeah that's a great
 

4759
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:43,590
will result in that yeah that's a great
question

4760
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:43,600
question
 

4761
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,790
question
i think for that to happen one of two

4762
01:20:46,790 --> 01:20:46,800
i think for that to happen one of two
 

4763
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:47,830
i think for that to happen one of two
things would have to

4764
01:20:47,830 --> 01:20:47,840
things would have to
 

4765
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,510
things would have to
obtain one of two things would have to

4766
01:20:49,510 --> 01:20:49,520
obtain one of two things would have to
 

4767
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,430
obtain one of two things would have to
happen for bitcoin to just

4768
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:51,440
happen for bitcoin to just
 

4769
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:54,470
happen for bitcoin to just
be irrelevant basically um

4770
01:20:54,470 --> 01:20:54,480
be irrelevant basically um
 

4771
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,550
be irrelevant basically um
either central banks totally clean up

4772
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:56,560
either central banks totally clean up
 

4773
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,229
either central banks totally clean up
their act and uh

4774
01:20:58,229 --> 01:20:58,239
their act and uh
 

4775
01:20:58,239 --> 01:21:00,390
their act and uh
you know stop engaging in rampant money

4776
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:00,400
you know stop engaging in rampant money
 

4777
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:01,510
you know stop engaging in rampant money
printing

4778
01:21:01,510 --> 01:21:01,520
printing
 

4779
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:02,950
printing
which i don't expect that to happen

4780
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:02,960
which i don't expect that to happen
 

4781
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:05,030
which i don't expect that to happen
anytime soon i mean it looks like we're

4782
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:05,040
anytime soon i mean it looks like we're
 

4783
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:08,229
anytime soon i mean it looks like we're
normalizing this new regime of inflation

4784
01:21:08,229 --> 01:21:08,239
normalizing this new regime of inflation
 

4785
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:10,070
normalizing this new regime of inflation
you know pro-inflation just to remediate

4786
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:10,080
you know pro-inflation just to remediate
 

4787
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,790
you know pro-inflation just to remediate
the debt issues we have

4788
01:21:12,790 --> 01:21:12,800
the debt issues we have
 

4789
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,790
the debt issues we have
uh so that would be one thing that would

4790
01:21:14,790 --> 01:21:14,800
uh so that would be one thing that would
 

4791
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,390
uh so that would be one thing that would
make bitcoin

4792
01:21:16,390 --> 01:21:16,400
make bitcoin
 

4793
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:19,110
make bitcoin
cryptocurrency much less relevant as if

4794
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:19,120
cryptocurrency much less relevant as if
 

4795
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,870
cryptocurrency much less relevant as if
everyone becomes totally assured of the

4796
01:21:20,870 --> 01:21:20,880
everyone becomes totally assured of the
 

4797
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:21,990
everyone becomes totally assured of the
soundness

4798
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:22,000
soundness
 

4799
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,590
soundness
of sovereign currencies basically

4800
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:25,600
of sovereign currencies basically
 

4801
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,189
of sovereign currencies basically
namely the dollar like the dollar being

4802
01:21:27,189 --> 01:21:27,199
namely the dollar like the dollar being
 

4803
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:29,510
namely the dollar like the dollar being
the main one uh

4804
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:29,520
the main one uh
 

4805
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,030
the main one uh
that it seems like we're going

4806
01:21:31,030 --> 01:21:31,040
that it seems like we're going
 

4807
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,709
that it seems like we're going
completely opposite direction

4808
01:21:32,709 --> 01:21:32,719
completely opposite direction
 

4809
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:35,270
completely opposite direction
but most people seem to be noticing the

4810
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:35,280
but most people seem to be noticing the
 

4811
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,590
but most people seem to be noticing the
stirrings of inflation in society

4812
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:37,600
stirrings of inflation in society
 

4813
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,510
stirrings of inflation in society
and you might have noticed it too it's

4814
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:39,520
and you might have noticed it too it's
 

4815
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,430
and you might have noticed it too it's
showing up in commodity prices lumber

4816
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:41,440
showing up in commodity prices lumber
 

4817
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:42,550
showing up in commodity prices lumber
prices

4818
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:42,560
prices
 

4819
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,550
prices
and food obviously in financial assets

4820
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:44,560
and food obviously in financial assets
 

4821
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:45,590
and food obviously in financial assets
and

4822
01:21:45,590 --> 01:21:45,600
and
 

4823
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,270
and
it'll show up in consumer prices

4824
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:47,280
it'll show up in consumer prices
 

4825
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,110
it'll show up in consumer prices
generally soon

4826
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:49,120
generally soon
 

4827
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:50,950
generally soon
but so that would be one way for bitcoin

4828
01:21:50,950 --> 01:21:50,960
but so that would be one way for bitcoin
 

4829
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,350
but so that would be one way for bitcoin
to basically become irrelevant

4830
01:21:53,350 --> 01:21:53,360
to basically become irrelevant
 

4831
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:54,790
to basically become irrelevant
because it's a you know it's a

4832
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:54,800
because it's a you know it's a
 

4833
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,390
because it's a you know it's a
dialectical thing

4834
01:21:56,390 --> 01:21:56,400
dialectical thing
 

4835
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:59,830
dialectical thing
bitcoin is held in opposition to

4836
01:21:59,830 --> 01:21:59,840
bitcoin is held in opposition to
 

4837
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:02,870
bitcoin is held in opposition to
the established monetary regime so if

4838
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:02,880
the established monetary regime so if
 

4839
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,189
the established monetary regime so if
they

4840
01:22:03,189 --> 01:22:03,199
they
 

4841
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:05,750
they
completely reform themselves and you

4842
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:05,760
completely reform themselves and you
 

4843
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,350
completely reform themselves and you
know the dollar becomes

4844
01:22:07,350 --> 01:22:07,360
know the dollar becomes
 

4845
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:10,709
know the dollar becomes
super sound once again and the fed stops

4846
01:22:10,709 --> 01:22:10,719
super sound once again and the fed stops
 

4847
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:11,510
super sound once again and the fed stops
tinkering

4848
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:11,520
tinkering
 

4849
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:15,350
tinkering
the way they constantly do then uh

4850
01:22:15,350 --> 01:22:15,360
the way they constantly do then uh
 

4851
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,189
the way they constantly do then uh
then we wouldn't need cryptocurrency as

4852
01:22:17,189 --> 01:22:17,199
then we wouldn't need cryptocurrency as
 

4853
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:19,990
then we wouldn't need cryptocurrency as
much the other thing would be if

4854
01:22:19,990 --> 01:22:20,000
much the other thing would be if
 

4855
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,110
much the other thing would be if
a completely superior design

4856
01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:23,120
a completely superior design
 

4857
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:26,629
a completely superior design
for a new sort of state independent

4858
01:22:26,629 --> 01:22:26,639
for a new sort of state independent
 

4859
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:28,470
for a new sort of state independent
monetary system emerged

4860
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:28,480
monetary system emerged
 

4861
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,870
monetary system emerged
but it's really hard to even imagine how

4862
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:30,880
but it's really hard to even imagine how
 

4863
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,629
but it's really hard to even imagine how
that would come to emerge

4864
01:22:32,629 --> 01:22:32,639
that would come to emerge
 

4865
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:35,590
that would come to emerge
and there's good reasons to think that

4866
01:22:35,590 --> 01:22:35,600
and there's good reasons to think that
 

4867
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,350
and there's good reasons to think that
bitcoin

4868
01:22:37,350 --> 01:22:37,360
bitcoin
 

4869
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:39,189
bitcoin
the conditions of its launch were

4870
01:22:39,189 --> 01:22:39,199
the conditions of its launch were
 

4871
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:40,790
the conditions of its launch were
extremely favorable and hard to

4872
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:40,800
extremely favorable and hard to
 

4873
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,310
extremely favorable and hard to
replicate

4874
01:22:42,310 --> 01:22:42,320
replicate
 

4875
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:43,350
replicate
can you speak to some of those

4876
01:22:43,350 --> 01:22:43,360
can you speak to some of those
 

4877
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:45,510
can you speak to some of those
conditions why it's a unique uh

4878
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:45,520
conditions why it's a unique uh
 

4879
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:49,350
conditions why it's a unique uh
timing wise uh moment for bitcoin to

4880
01:22:49,350 --> 01:22:49,360
timing wise uh moment for bitcoin to
 

4881
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:49,910
timing wise uh moment for bitcoin to
emerge

4882
01:22:49,910 --> 01:22:49,920
emerge
 

4883
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:52,149
emerge
yeah so obviously bitcoin was born in

4884
01:22:52,149 --> 01:22:52,159
yeah so obviously bitcoin was born in
 

4885
01:22:52,159 --> 01:22:53,910
yeah so obviously bitcoin was born in
the depths of the financial crisis which

4886
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:53,920
the depths of the financial crisis which
 

4887
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:55,669
the depths of the financial crisis which
gives it a nice

4888
01:22:55,669 --> 01:22:55,679
gives it a nice
 

4889
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:59,270
gives it a nice
nice historical element but that was

4890
01:22:59,270 --> 01:22:59,280
nice historical element but that was
 

4891
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:00,950
nice historical element but that was
kind of a coincidence honestly we know

4892
01:23:00,950 --> 01:23:00,960
kind of a coincidence honestly we know
 

4893
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,709
kind of a coincidence honestly we know
that satoshi had been working on it

4894
01:23:02,709 --> 01:23:02,719
that satoshi had been working on it
 

4895
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:06,870
that satoshi had been working on it
earlier in back or in 2017.

4896

um the really special thing about

4898
01:23:08,709 --> 01:23:08,719
um the really special thing about
 

4899
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:10,470
um the really special thing about
bitcoin was that

4900
01:23:10,470 --> 01:23:10,480
bitcoin was that
 

4901
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:13,590
bitcoin was that
it was launched anonymously by an entity

4902
01:23:13,590 --> 01:23:13,600
it was launched anonymously by an entity
 

4903
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,910
it was launched anonymously by an entity
that did not seek any glory or credit

that did not seek any glory or credit
 

4905
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:16,870
that did not seek any glory or credit
for what they did

4906
01:23:16,870 --> 01:23:16,880
for what they did
 

4907
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:19,669
for what they did
and apparently never monetized it at all

4908
01:23:19,669 --> 01:23:19,679
and apparently never monetized it at all
 

4909
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:21,189
and apparently never monetized it at all
so they never really

4910
01:23:21,189 --> 01:23:21,199
so they never really
 

4911
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:24,149
so they never really
moved any of their coins satoshi sent

4912
01:23:24,149 --> 01:23:24,159
moved any of their coins satoshi sent
 

4913

there weren't really any marketplaces it
 

5039
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,030
there weren't really any marketplaces it
didn't have a value

didn't have a value
 

5041
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:29,590
didn't have a value
and so that gave it this really great

5042
01:25:29,590 --> 01:25:29,600

is going to own 30 of it and so it's

01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:51,120
is going to own 30 of it and so it's
 

5067
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,709
is going to own 30 of it and so it's
sort of impossible to conceive of how

5068
01:25:52,709 --> 01:25:52,719
sort of impossible to conceive of how
 

5069
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:54,550
sort of impossible to conceive of how
that could become a global money

5070
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:54,560
that could become a global money
 

5071
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:57,910
that could become a global money
because how could you know a

5072
01:25:57,910 --> 01:25:57,920
because how could you know a
 

5073
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:01,189
because how could you know a

silicon valley investment firm own
 

5075
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:02,629
silicon valley investment firm own
30 percent of the money supply that

5076
01:26:02,629 --> 01:26:02,639
30 percent of the money supply that
 

5077
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:04,870
30 percent of the money supply that
doesn't make sense that's just so

5078
01:26:04,870 --> 01:26:04,880
doesn't make sense that's just so
 

5079
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:07,910
doesn't make sense that's just so
oligarchical right it's unbelievable so

5080
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:07,920
oligarchical right it's unbelievable so
 

5081
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:10,149
oligarchical right it's unbelievable so
bitcoin by contracts is a very bottom-up

5082
01:26:10,149 --> 01:26:10,159
bitcoin by contracts is a very bottom-up
 

5083
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:11,590
bitcoin by contracts is a very bottom-up
thing

5084
01:26:11,590 --> 01:26:11,600
thing
 

5085
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,950
thing
it was the early enthusiasts uh

5086
01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:14,960
it was the early enthusiasts uh
 

5087
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:17,910
it was the early enthusiasts uh
people that were you know really um

5088
01:26:17,910 --> 01:26:17,920
people that were you know really um
 

5089
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:18,790
people that were you know really um
excited about the

5090
01:26:18,790 --> 01:26:18,800
excited about the
 

5091
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:21,110
excited about the
technology they're the ones that obtain

5092
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:21,120
technology they're the ones that obtain
 

5093
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:23,430
technology they're the ones that obtain
those early coins and so

5094
01:26:23,430 --> 01:26:23,440
those early coins and so
 

5095
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:25,430
those early coins and so
there was a real element of fairness and

5096
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:25,440
there was a real element of fairness and
 

5097
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:27,510
there was a real element of fairness and
just an organic nature to its launch

5098
01:26:27,510 --> 01:26:27,520
just an organic nature to its launch
 

5099
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,030
just an organic nature to its launch
which would be incredibly hard to

5100
01:26:29,030 --> 01:26:29,040
which would be incredibly hard to
 

5101
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:30,950
which would be incredibly hard to
recapture today let's say

5102
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:30,960
recapture today let's say
 

5103
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:34,149
recapture today let's say
satoshi came back and they

5104
01:26:34,149 --> 01:26:34,159
satoshi came back and they
 

5105
01:26:34,159 --> 01:26:36,229
satoshi came back and they
said okay i made bitcoin 2.0 i'm going

5106
01:26:36,229 --> 01:26:36,239
said okay i made bitcoin 2.0 i'm going
 

5107
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:37,430
said okay i made bitcoin 2.0 i'm going
to release it

5108
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:37,440
to release it
 

5109
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:39,750
to release it
there would be the most aggressive land

5110
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:39,760
there would be the most aggressive land
 

5111
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,189
there would be the most aggressive land
grab ever

5112

by you know gigantic pools of capital to
 

5115
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:47,270
by you know gigantic pools of capital to
sort of get favorable allocations of the

5116
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:47,280
sort of get favorable allocations of the
 

5117
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:48,149
sort of get favorable allocations of the
new system

5118
01:26:48,149 --> 01:26:48,159
new system
 

5119
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:51,910
new system
right can satoshi with bitcoin 2.0 build

5120
01:26:51,910 --> 01:26:51,920
right can satoshi with bitcoin 2.0 build
 

5121
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:52,950
right can satoshi with bitcoin 2.0 build
in

5122
01:26:52,950 --> 01:26:52,960
in
 

5123
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:56,070
in
a resistance mechanism or a prevention

5124
01:26:56,070 --> 01:26:56,080
a resistance mechanism or a prevention
 

5125
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,990
a resistance mechanism or a prevention
mechanism for the land grab

5126
01:26:57,990 --> 01:26:58,000
mechanism for the land grab
 

5127
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,950
mechanism for the land grab
it would be hard to because you know if

5128
01:27:00,950 --> 01:27:00,960
it would be hard to because you know if
 

5129
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:02,790
it would be hard to because you know if
you have capital and resources

5130
01:27:02,790 --> 01:27:02,800
you have capital and resources
 

5131
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,390
you have capital and resources
i mean if it was a proof of work chain

5132
01:27:04,390 --> 01:27:04,400
i mean if it was a proof of work chain
 

5133
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:05,830
i mean if it was a proof of work chain
you just have people that would invest a

5134
01:27:05,830 --> 01:27:05,840
you just have people that would invest a
 

5135
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,750
you just have people that would invest a
ton of money in mining for instance

5136
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:07,760
ton of money in mining for instance
 

5137
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:09,590
ton of money in mining for instance
but most new blockchains

5138
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:09,600
but most new blockchains
 

5139
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,189
but most new blockchains
cryptocurrencies are just

5140
01:27:11,189 --> 01:27:11,199
cryptocurrencies are just
 

5141
01:27:11,199 --> 01:27:13,510
cryptocurrencies are just
sold basically they're you know issued

5142
01:27:13,510 --> 01:27:13,520
sold basically they're you know issued
 

5143
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:16,550
sold basically they're you know issued
in token offerings kind of thing so

5144
01:27:16,550 --> 01:27:16,560
in token offerings kind of thing so
 

5145
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,550
in token offerings kind of thing so
so it's hard to enforce through the

5146
01:27:18,550 --> 01:27:18,560
so it's hard to enforce through the
 

5147
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,790
so it's hard to enforce through the
protocol the decentralization of

5148
01:27:20,790 --> 01:27:20,800
protocol the decentralization of
 

5149
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:23,350
protocol the decentralization of
control yeah power it'd be challenging

5150
01:27:23,350 --> 01:27:23,360
control yeah power it'd be challenging
 

5151
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:24,709
control yeah power it'd be challenging
too and people have tried to do air

5152
01:27:24,709 --> 01:27:24,719
too and people have tried to do air
 

5153
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:25,750
too and people have tried to do air
drops you know

5154
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:25,760
drops you know
 

5155
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:28,310
drops you know
where they you know distribute coins to

5156
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:28,320
where they you know distribute coins to
 

5157
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:29,510
where they you know distribute coins to
a large number of people basically

5158
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:29,520
a large number of people basically
 

5159
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:30,550
a large number of people basically
doesn't work

5160
01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:30,560
doesn't work
 

5161
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,910
doesn't work
most people don't care about the air

5162
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:31,920
most people don't care about the air
 

5163
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:34,950
most people don't care about the air
drop so it's hard to have an equitable

5164
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:34,960
drop so it's hard to have an equitable
 

5165
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:36,149
drop so it's hard to have an equitable
distribution

5166
01:27:36,149 --> 01:27:36,159
distribution
 

5167
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:37,830
distribution
i think the conditions of bitcoin's

5168
01:27:37,830 --> 01:27:37,840
i think the conditions of bitcoin's
 

5169
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,590
i think the conditions of bitcoin's
launch were so lucky

5170
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:39,600
launch were so lucky
 

5171
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:42,310
launch were so lucky
and favorable that they're very unlikely

5172
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:42,320
and favorable that they're very unlikely
 

5173
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:43,990
and favorable that they're very unlikely
to be replicated

5174
01:27:43,990 --> 01:27:44,000
to be replicated
 

5175
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,990
to be replicated
so i do think it's going to be real

5176
01:27:45,990 --> 01:27:46,000
so i do think it's going to be real
 

5177
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,470
so i do think it's going to be real
challenge to ever have a new competitor

5178
01:27:48,470 --> 01:27:48,480
challenge to ever have a new competitor
 

5179
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:51,750
challenge to ever have a new competitor
that's as decentralized as leaderless as

01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:51,760
that's as decentralized as leaderless as

01:27:58,229 --> 01:27:58,239
i don't know how you could overrule it
 

5187
01:27:58,239 --> 01:27:59,750
i don't know how you could overrule it
on those important features

5188
01:27:59,750 --> 01:27:59,760
on those important features
 

5189
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:02,629
on those important features
what about bitcoins comparison to other

5190
01:28:02,629 --> 01:28:02,639
what about bitcoins comparison to other
 

5191
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:04,310
what about bitcoins comparison to other
current cryptocurrencies so

5192
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:04,320
current cryptocurrencies so
 

5193
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:07,430
current cryptocurrencies so
bitcoin versus ethereum for example

5194
01:28:07,430 --> 01:28:07,440
bitcoin versus ethereum for example
 

5195
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:10,790
bitcoin versus ethereum for example
why um is it possible that ethereum

5196
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:10,800
why um is it possible that ethereum
 

5197
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,149
why um is it possible that ethereum
overtakes bitcoin

5198
01:28:12,149 --> 01:28:12,159
overtakes bitcoin
 

5199
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:13,990
overtakes bitcoin
that's certainly possible yeah i'm not

5200
01:28:13,990 --> 01:28:14,000
that's certainly possible yeah i'm not
 

5201
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,270
that's certainly possible yeah i'm not
ruling it out

5202
01:28:15,270 --> 01:28:15,280
ruling it out
 

5203
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:18,070
ruling it out
um ethereum leadership is sort of wise

5204
01:28:18,070 --> 01:28:18,080
um ethereum leadership is sort of wise
 

5205
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:19,830
um ethereum leadership is sort of wise
enough to understand

5206
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:19,840
enough to understand
 

5207
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:22,390
enough to understand
that they shouldn't compete with bitcoin

5208
01:28:22,390 --> 01:28:22,400
that they shouldn't compete with bitcoin
 

5209
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,030
that they shouldn't compete with bitcoin
on those

5210
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:23,040
on those
 

5211
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:26,550
on those
most profound qualities like ethereum

5212
01:28:26,550 --> 01:28:26,560
most profound qualities like ethereum
 

5213
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:28,629
most profound qualities like ethereum
doesn't really aspire to be

5214
01:28:28,629 --> 01:28:28,639
doesn't really aspire to be
 

5215
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:31,669
doesn't really aspire to be
more sound from a monetary perspective

5216
01:28:31,669 --> 01:28:31,679
more sound from a monetary perspective
 

5217
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:32,790
more sound from a monetary perspective
than bitcoin

5218
01:28:32,790 --> 01:28:32,800
than bitcoin
 

5219
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:33,910
than bitcoin
right the in fact the ethereum

5220
01:28:33,910 --> 01:28:33,920
right the in fact the ethereum
 

5221
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:35,350
right the in fact the ethereum
leadership are sort of constantly

5222
01:28:35,350 --> 01:28:35,360
leadership are sort of constantly
 

5223
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:37,590
leadership are sort of constantly
tweaking the monetary policy

5224
01:28:37,590 --> 01:28:37,600
tweaking the monetary policy
 

5225
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,430
tweaking the monetary policy
so they went for a completely different

5226
01:28:39,430 --> 01:28:39,440
so they went for a completely different
 

5227
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:41,189
so they went for a completely different
trade-off right

5228
01:28:41,189 --> 01:28:41,199
trade-off right
 

5229
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:43,990
trade-off right
they also don't compete to be as

5230
01:28:43,990 --> 01:28:44,000
they also don't compete to be as
 

5231
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,590
they also don't compete to be as
decentralized from a governance

5232
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:45,600
decentralized from a governance
 

5233
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:46,790
decentralized from a governance
perspective right

5234
01:28:46,790 --> 01:28:46,800
perspective right
 

5235
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,310
perspective right
because there's leadership there's an

5236
01:28:48,310 --> 01:28:48,320
because there's leadership there's an
 

5237
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:50,629
because there's leadership there's an
eth foundation there's a charismatic

5238
01:28:50,629 --> 01:28:50,639
eth foundation there's a charismatic
 

5239
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:52,310
eth foundation there's a charismatic
leader of italic

5240
01:28:52,310 --> 01:28:52,320
leader of italic
 

5241
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:54,950
leader of italic
and ethereum has this policy of hard

5242
01:28:54,950 --> 01:28:54,960
and ethereum has this policy of hard
 

5243
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:55,590
and ethereum has this policy of hard
forks

5244
01:28:55,590 --> 01:28:55,600
forks
 

5245
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:59,030
forks
so in bitcoin hard forks extremely rare

5246
01:28:59,030 --> 01:28:59,040
so in bitcoin hard forks extremely rare
 

5247
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:00,870
so in bitcoin hard forks extremely rare
in ethereum it's the default way to

5248
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:00,880
in ethereum it's the default way to
 

5249
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:02,870
in ethereum it's the default way to
change things so it's a much

5250
01:29:02,870 --> 01:29:02,880
change things so it's a much
 

5251
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:05,430
change things so it's a much
more adaptive system and it changes more

5252
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:05,440
more adaptive system and it changes more
 

5253
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:06,390
more adaptive system and it changes more
frequently

5254
01:29:06,390 --> 01:29:06,400
frequently
 

5255
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:08,629
frequently
but that also means that it's sort of

5256
01:29:08,629 --> 01:29:08,639
but that also means that it's sort of
 

5257
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:09,990
but that also means that it's sort of
they're incurring more risk

5258
01:29:09,990 --> 01:29:10,000
they're incurring more risk
 

5259
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,830
they're incurring more risk
when they introduce those changes

5260
01:29:11,830 --> 01:29:11,840
when they introduce those changes
 

5261
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:14,149
when they introduce those changes
there's much more complexity so

5262
01:29:14,149 --> 01:29:14,159
there's much more complexity so
 

5263
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:16,950
there's much more complexity so
ethereum is smart because they sort of

5264
01:29:16,950 --> 01:29:16,960
ethereum is smart because they sort of
 

5265
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:18,870
ethereum is smart because they sort of
understood bitcoin as the top dog when

5266
01:29:18,870 --> 01:29:18,880
understood bitcoin as the top dog when
 

5267
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:19,990
understood bitcoin as the top dog when
it comes to a sound

5268
01:29:19,990 --> 01:29:20,000
it comes to a sound
 

5269
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,669
it comes to a sound
money a digital gold type thing

5270
01:29:23,669 --> 01:29:23,679
money a digital gold type thing
 

5271
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:25,030
money a digital gold type thing
and they went for all of the different

5272
01:29:25,030 --> 01:29:25,040
and they went for all of the different
 

5273
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:27,830
and they went for all of the different
trade-offs they wanted to be

5274
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:27,840
trade-offs they wanted to be
 

5275
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:30,070
trade-offs they wanted to be
more of a platform they wanted to have

5276
01:29:30,070 --> 01:29:30,080
more of a platform they wanted to have
 

5277
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:32,870
more of a platform they wanted to have
more complexity the transactional layer

5278
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:32,880
more complexity the transactional layer
 

5279
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:34,950
more complexity the transactional layer
they wanted to take on more risk in

5280
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:34,960
they wanted to take on more risk in
 

5281
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:36,550
they wanted to take on more risk in
terms of changing the protocol they

5282
01:29:36,550 --> 01:29:36,560
terms of changing the protocol they
 

5283
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:38,790
terms of changing the protocol they
wanted to change more quickly

5284
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:38,800
wanted to change more quickly
 

5285
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,950
wanted to change more quickly
they wanted to make the monetary policy

5286
01:29:40,950 --> 01:29:40,960
they wanted to make the monetary policy
 

5287
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:42,470
they wanted to make the monetary policy
more mutable

5288
01:29:42,470 --> 01:29:42,480
more mutable
 

5289
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:45,669
more mutable
so ethereum takes that completely

5290
01:29:45,669 --> 01:29:45,679
so ethereum takes that completely
 

5291
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:47,030
so ethereum takes that completely
different tack of course

5292
01:29:47,030 --> 01:29:47,040
different tack of course
 

5293
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,229
different tack of course
you know i'm not ruling out that it

5294
01:29:48,229 --> 01:29:48,239
you know i'm not ruling out that it
 

5295
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:50,550
you know i'm not ruling out that it
could take over bitcoin from a market

5296
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:50,560
could take over bitcoin from a market
 

5297
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:52,070
could take over bitcoin from a market
cap perspective

5298
01:29:52,070 --> 01:29:52,080
cap perspective
 

5299
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:55,350
cap perspective
it's just a very different system and i

5300
01:29:55,350 --> 01:29:55,360
it's just a very different system and i
 

5301
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:56,709
it's just a very different system and i
tend to think the bitcoin is the most

5302
01:29:56,709 --> 01:29:56,719
tend to think the bitcoin is the most
 

5303
01:29:56,719 --> 01:29:58,629
tend to think the bitcoin is the most
disruptive one because it's

5304
01:29:58,629 --> 01:29:58,639
disruptive one because it's
 

5305
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:01,590
disruptive one because it's
the most equipped to challenge sovereign

5306
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:01,600
the most equipped to challenge sovereign
 

5307
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,229
the most equipped to challenge sovereign
currencies

5308
01:30:02,229 --> 01:30:02,239
currencies
 

5309
01:30:02,239 --> 01:30:03,830
currencies
in the grand scheme do you think they

5310
01:30:03,830 --> 01:30:03,840
in the grand scheme do you think they
 

5311
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:06,149
in the grand scheme do you think they
can co-exist

5312
01:30:06,149 --> 01:30:06,159
can co-exist
 

5313
01:30:06,159 --> 01:30:08,870
can co-exist
so like in the future is do you see a

5314
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:08,880
so like in the future is do you see a
 

5315
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:10,790
so like in the future is do you see a
world where

5316
01:30:10,790 --> 01:30:10,800
world where
 

5317
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:13,910
world where
you know uh ethereum captures

5318
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:13,920
you know uh ethereum captures
 

5319
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:16,790
you know uh ethereum captures
some large percent of the market and but

5320
01:30:16,790 --> 01:30:16,800
some large percent of the market and but
 

5321
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,030
some large percent of the market and but
nevertheless the minority

5322
01:30:19,030 --> 01:30:19,040
nevertheless the minority
 

5323
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:21,990
nevertheless the minority
a hundred percent 100 percent bitcoin

5324
01:30:21,990 --> 01:30:22,000
a hundred percent 100 percent bitcoin
 

5325
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,149
a hundred percent 100 percent bitcoin
has already been tokenized and put

5326
01:30:24,149 --> 01:30:24,159
has already been tokenized and put
 

5327
01:30:24,159 --> 01:30:26,790
has already been tokenized and put
on to ethereum many units of bitcoin i

5328
01:30:26,790 --> 01:30:26,800
on to ethereum many units of bitcoin i
 

5329
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,790
on to ethereum many units of bitcoin i
think over a billion dollars worth

5330
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:28,800
think over a billion dollars worth
 

5331
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:31,430
think over a billion dollars worth
so not only do they coexist they are

5332
01:30:31,430 --> 01:30:31,440
so not only do they coexist they are
 

5333
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:33,510
so not only do they coexist they are
actually mutualistic

5334
01:30:33,510 --> 01:30:33,520
actually mutualistic
 

5335
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:35,510
actually mutualistic
so they're like two creatures that have

5336
01:30:35,510 --> 01:30:35,520
so they're like two creatures that have
 

5337
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:38,229
so they're like two creatures that have
this you know it's like the

5338
01:30:38,229 --> 01:30:38,239
this you know it's like the
 

5339
01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:40,550
this you know it's like the
the rhino and like the bird the pecks

5340
01:30:40,550 --> 01:30:40,560
the rhino and like the bird the pecks
 

5341
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,470
the rhino and like the bird the pecks
the parasites off the rhino's back or

5342
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:42,480
the parasites off the rhino's back or
 

5343
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:43,189
the parasites off the rhino's back or
whatever

5344
01:30:43,189 --> 01:30:43,199
whatever
 

5345
01:30:43,199 --> 01:30:45,030
whatever
yeah right so i don't know which is

5346
01:30:45,030 --> 01:30:45,040
yeah right so i don't know which is
 

5347
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,870
yeah right so i don't know which is
which in the analogy but

5348
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:46,880
which in the analogy but
 

5349
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:50,470
which in the analogy but
yeah i don't know who the parasites are

5350
01:30:50,470 --> 01:30:50,480

 

5351
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:53,669

yellow or you know the alligator and the

5352
01:30:53,669 --> 01:30:53,679
yellow or you know the alligator and the
 

5353
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:56,070
yellow or you know the alligator and the
teeth cleaning fish or whatever right so

5354
01:30:56,070 --> 01:30:56,080
teeth cleaning fish or whatever right so
 

5355
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:57,510
teeth cleaning fish or whatever right so
oh you know i always wonder why the

5356
01:30:57,510 --> 01:30:57,520
oh you know i always wonder why the
 

5357
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:58,709
oh you know i always wonder why the
alligator doesn't just

5358
01:30:58,709 --> 01:30:58,719
alligator doesn't just
 

5359
01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:01,110
alligator doesn't just
eat the fish but uh i guess they're

5360
01:31:01,110 --> 01:31:01,120
eat the fish but uh i guess they're
 

5361
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:01,990
eat the fish but uh i guess they're
brushing its teeth

5362
01:31:01,990 --> 01:31:02,000
brushing its teeth
 

5363
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,510
brushing its teeth
basically so um ethereum

5364
01:31:05,510 --> 01:31:05,520
basically so um ethereum
 

5365
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:07,270
basically so um ethereum
is it gives you more transactional

5366
01:31:07,270 --> 01:31:07,280
is it gives you more transactional
 

5367
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:08,790
is it gives you more transactional
flexibility there's much more

5368
01:31:08,790 --> 01:31:08,800
flexibility there's much more
 

5369
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,790
flexibility there's much more
experimentation happening there

5370
01:31:10,790 --> 01:31:10,800
experimentation happening there
 

5371
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:13,030
experimentation happening there
it has this whole decentralized finance

5372
01:31:13,030 --> 01:31:13,040
it has this whole decentralized finance
 

5373
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:14,070
it has this whole decentralized finance
element

5374
01:31:14,070 --> 01:31:14,080
element
 

5375
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:15,830
element
there's a huge number of bitcoins that

5376
01:31:15,830 --> 01:31:15,840
there's a huge number of bitcoins that
 

5377
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,070
there's a huge number of bitcoins that
circulate on the ethereum protocol

5378
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:18,080
circulate on the ethereum protocol
 

5379
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:20,550
circulate on the ethereum protocol
right because ethereum is open to other

5380
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:20,560
right because ethereum is open to other
 

5381
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:21,430
right because ethereum is open to other
asset types

5382
01:31:21,430 --> 01:31:21,440
asset types
 

5383
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:24,310
asset types
basically so i think that's actually

5384
01:31:24,310 --> 01:31:24,320
basically so i think that's actually
 

5385
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:26,550
basically so i think that's actually
accretive to both systems

5386
01:31:26,550 --> 01:31:26,560
accretive to both systems
 

5387
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,390
accretive to both systems
because ethereum gets to have this good

5388
01:31:28,390 --> 01:31:28,400
because ethereum gets to have this good
 

5389
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,229
because ethereum gets to have this good
form of collateral bitcoin

5390
01:31:30,229 --> 01:31:30,239
form of collateral bitcoin
 

5391
01:31:30,239 --> 01:31:32,790
form of collateral bitcoin
on the system which is good volatility

5392
01:31:32,790 --> 01:31:32,800
on the system which is good volatility
 

5393
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,070
on the system which is good volatility
characteristics

5394
01:31:34,070 --> 01:31:34,080
characteristics
 

5395
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:37,669
characteristics
and then it's a supply sync for bitcoins

5396
01:31:37,669 --> 01:31:37,679
and then it's a supply sync for bitcoins
 

5397
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:40,390
and then it's a supply sync for bitcoins
which are sort of now they're injected

5398
01:31:40,390 --> 01:31:40,400
which are sort of now they're injected
 

5399
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,390
which are sort of now they're injected
into this third-party protocol

5400
01:31:42,390 --> 01:31:42,400
into this third-party protocol
 

5401
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:45,590
into this third-party protocol
and that i think reduces the velocity of

5402
01:31:45,590 --> 01:31:45,600
and that i think reduces the velocity of
 

5403
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,110
and that i think reduces the velocity of
bitcoin overall and it's probably good

5404
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:47,120
bitcoin overall and it's probably good
 

5405
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:48,950
bitcoin overall and it's probably good
for the valuation

5406
01:31:48,950 --> 01:31:48,960
for the valuation
 

5407
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:51,110
for the valuation
so you see it it quite possibly could be

5408
01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:51,120
so you see it it quite possibly could be
 

5409
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,030
so you see it it quite possibly could be
a symbiotic relationship that's really

5410
01:31:53,030 --> 01:31:53,040
a symbiotic relationship that's really
 

5411
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:53,590
a symbiotic relationship that's really
interesting

5412
01:31:53,590 --> 01:31:53,600
interesting
 

5413
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:56,470
interesting
i think so i think so uh what are your

5414
01:31:56,470 --> 01:31:56,480
i think so i think so uh what are your
 

5415
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:57,189
i think so i think so uh what are your
thoughts

5416
01:31:57,189 --> 01:31:57,199
thoughts
 

5417
01:31:57,199 --> 01:32:01,030
thoughts
about uh vitalik buterin

5418
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:01,040
about uh vitalik buterin
 

5419
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:03,270
about uh vitalik buterin
what are your thoughts about some of the

5420
01:32:03,270 --> 01:32:03,280
what are your thoughts about some of the
 

5421
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:05,189
what are your thoughts about some of the
other figures in the space

5422
01:32:05,189 --> 01:32:05,199
other figures in the space
 

5423
01:32:05,199 --> 01:32:08,229
other figures in the space
outside of bitcoin i think vitalik made

5424
01:32:08,229 --> 01:32:08,239
outside of bitcoin i think vitalik made
 

5425
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:09,910
outside of bitcoin i think vitalik made
some mistakes with ethereum

5426
01:32:09,910 --> 01:32:09,920
some mistakes with ethereum
 

5427
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:12,709
some mistakes with ethereum
ultimately like i disagree with some of

5428
01:32:12,709 --> 01:32:12,719
ultimately like i disagree with some of
 

5429
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:14,390
ultimately like i disagree with some of
the decisions that were made

5430
01:32:14,390 --> 01:32:14,400
the decisions that were made
 

5431
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:16,390
the decisions that were made
along the way like there's this infamous

5432
01:32:16,390 --> 01:32:16,400
along the way like there's this infamous
 

5433
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:17,910
along the way like there's this infamous
case of this bailout

5434
01:32:17,910 --> 01:32:17,920
case of this bailout
 

5435
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:21,030
case of this bailout
where 14 of ether was lost in the smart

5436
01:32:21,030 --> 01:32:21,040
where 14 of ether was lost in the smart
 

5437
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:22,229
where 14 of ether was lost in the smart
contract

5438
01:32:22,229 --> 01:32:22,239
contract
 

5439
01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:25,030
contract
or really the this smart contract that a

5440
01:32:25,030 --> 01:32:25,040
or really the this smart contract that a
 

5441
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:26,709
or really the this smart contract that a
lot of ethereum leadership were sort of

5442
01:32:26,709 --> 01:32:26,719
lot of ethereum leadership were sort of
 

5443
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:29,189
lot of ethereum leadership were sort of
backing and supporting was hacked

5444
01:32:29,189 --> 01:32:29,199
backing and supporting was hacked
 

5445
01:32:29,199 --> 01:32:31,910
backing and supporting was hacked
and then the foundation with vitalik

5446
01:32:31,910 --> 01:32:31,920
and then the foundation with vitalik
 

5447
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:33,189
and then the foundation with vitalik
support

5448
01:32:33,189 --> 01:32:33,199
support
 

5449
01:32:33,199 --> 01:32:36,470
support
chose to make a change to the underlying

5450
01:32:36,470 --> 01:32:36,480
chose to make a change to the underlying
 

5451
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:37,510
chose to make a change to the underlying
protocol

5452
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:37,520
protocol
 

5453
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:40,790
protocol
to undo the hack right so

5454
01:32:40,790 --> 01:32:40,800
to undo the hack right so
 

5455
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:44,470
to undo the hack right so
to me that was not the most

5456
01:32:44,470 --> 01:32:44,480
to me that was not the most
 

5457
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,790
to me that was not the most
prudent approach because you're

5458
01:32:46,790 --> 01:32:46,800
prudent approach because you're
 

5459
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,070
prudent approach because you're
basically

5460
01:32:48,070 --> 01:32:48,080
basically
 

5461
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:50,229
basically
violating the core protocol rules in

5462
01:32:50,229 --> 01:32:50,239
violating the core protocol rules in
 

5463
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:52,390
violating the core protocol rules in
order to undo

5464
01:32:52,390 --> 01:32:52,400
order to undo
 

5465
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:55,350
order to undo
you know to bail out a specific contract

5466
01:32:55,350 --> 01:32:55,360
you know to bail out a specific contract
 

5467
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:56,310
you know to bail out a specific contract
which is failed

5468
01:32:56,310 --> 01:32:56,320
which is failed
 

5469
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:57,830
which is failed
granted there was a lot of ether in

5470
01:32:57,830 --> 01:32:57,840
granted there was a lot of ether in
 

5471
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:59,510
granted there was a lot of ether in
there but

5472
01:32:59,510 --> 01:32:59,520
there but
 

5473
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,350
there but
i think that shook the credibility of

5474
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:01,360
i think that shook the credibility of
 

5475
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:02,629
i think that shook the credibility of
the ethereum system

5476
01:33:02,629 --> 01:33:02,639
the ethereum system
 

5477
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:05,590
the ethereum system
it happened back in 2016 i think uh that

5478
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:05,600
it happened back in 2016 i think uh that
 

5479
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,110
it happened back in 2016 i think uh that
was one reason why i

5480
01:33:07,110 --> 01:33:07,120
was one reason why i
 

5481
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:09,750
was one reason why i
i became disenchanted with ethereum so

5482
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:09,760
i became disenchanted with ethereum so
 

5483
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,270
i became disenchanted with ethereum so
basically

5484
01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:11,280
basically
 

5485
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:14,550
basically
even if in that case that might fix an

5486
01:33:14,550 --> 01:33:14,560
even if in that case that might fix an
 

5487
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:17,110
even if in that case that might fix an
important problem that opens the door

5488
01:33:17,110 --> 01:33:17,120
important problem that opens the door
 

5489
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:20,310
important problem that opens the door
to centralized like

5490
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:20,320
to centralized like
 

5491
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:21,990
to centralized like
manipulation of the protocol in the

5492
01:33:21,990 --> 01:33:22,000
manipulation of the protocol in the
 

5493
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,149
manipulation of the protocol in the
future yeah it basically demonstrates

5494
01:33:24,149 --> 01:33:24,159
future yeah it basically demonstrates
 

5495
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:25,590
future yeah it basically demonstrates
that there's certain elites

5496
01:33:25,590 --> 01:33:25,600
that there's certain elites
 

5497
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:28,470
that there's certain elites
at the protocol level that can exercise

5498
01:33:28,470 --> 01:33:28,480
at the protocol level that can exercise
 

5499
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:30,229
at the protocol level that can exercise
specific control

5500
01:33:30,229 --> 01:33:30,239
specific control
 

5501
01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:33,270
specific control
over the system and you know

5502
01:33:33,270 --> 01:33:33,280
over the system and you know
 

5503
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:35,669
over the system and you know
a lot of people have lost money in hacks

5504
01:33:35,669 --> 01:33:35,679
a lot of people have lost money in hacks
 

5505
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:37,590
a lot of people have lost money in hacks
on ethereum and a lot of contracts have

5506
01:33:37,590 --> 01:33:37,600
on ethereum and a lot of contracts have
 

5507
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:38,629
on ethereum and a lot of contracts have
gone south

5508
01:33:38,629 --> 01:33:38,639
gone south
 

5509
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:41,110
gone south
a huge amount of value but they didn't

5510
01:33:41,110 --> 01:33:41,120
a huge amount of value but they didn't
 

5511
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:42,390
a huge amount of value but they didn't
get a bailout

5512
01:33:42,390 --> 01:33:42,400
get a bailout
 

5513
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,470
get a bailout
and it was just when you know this

5514
01:33:44,470 --> 01:33:44,480
and it was just when you know this
 

5515
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:45,750
and it was just when you know this
specific

5516
01:33:45,750 --> 01:33:45,760
specific
 

5517
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:49,189
specific
contract called the dao dao

5518
01:33:49,189 --> 01:33:49,199
contract called the dao dao
 

5519
01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:52,229
contract called the dao dao
was hacked that you know the leadership

5520
01:33:52,229 --> 01:33:52,239
was hacked that you know the leadership
 

5521
01:33:52,239 --> 01:33:53,510
was hacked that you know the leadership
intervened

5522
01:33:53,510 --> 01:33:53,520
intervened
 

5523
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:55,189
intervened
and and you know to their credit they

5524
01:33:55,189 --> 01:33:55,199
and and you know to their credit they
 

5525
01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:57,350
and and you know to their credit they
haven't had a significant intervention

5526
01:33:57,350 --> 01:33:57,360
haven't had a significant intervention
 

5527
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:59,430
haven't had a significant intervention
or bailout since then

5528
01:33:59,430 --> 01:33:59,440
or bailout since then
 

5529
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:02,070
or bailout since then
but it did normalize the practice and i

5530
01:34:02,070 --> 01:34:02,080
but it did normalize the practice and i
 

5531
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:04,629
but it did normalize the practice and i
think it weakened the social contract

5532
01:34:04,629 --> 01:34:04,639
think it weakened the social contract
 

5533
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:07,350
think it weakened the social contract
so i would prefer that you sort of bite

5534
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:07,360
so i would prefer that you sort of bite
 

5535
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:09,189
so i would prefer that you sort of bite
the bullet in that situation

5536
01:34:09,189 --> 01:34:09,199
the bullet in that situation
 

5537
01:34:09,199 --> 01:34:11,430
the bullet in that situation
and you accept the failure of that

5538
01:34:11,430 --> 01:34:11,440
and you accept the failure of that
 

5539
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:12,229
and you accept the failure of that
contract

5540
01:34:12,229 --> 01:34:12,239
contract
 

5541
01:34:12,239 --> 01:34:15,030
contract
that would be a ballsy move to bite that

5542
01:34:15,030 --> 01:34:15,040
that would be a ballsy move to bite that
 

5543
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:15,590
that would be a ballsy move to bite that
bullet

5544
01:34:15,590 --> 01:34:15,600
bullet
 

5545
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,030
bullet
yeah i mean and then you would have had

5546
01:34:17,030 --> 01:34:17,040
yeah i mean and then you would have had
 

5547
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:18,790
yeah i mean and then you would have had
like what they thought was a malicious

5548
01:34:18,790 --> 01:34:18,800
like what they thought was a malicious
 

5549
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:19,510
like what they thought was a malicious
entity in

5550
01:34:19,510 --> 01:34:19,520
entity in
 

5551
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,830
entity in
control of a lot of coins i think the

5552
01:34:21,830 --> 01:34:21,840
control of a lot of coins i think the
 

5553
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:22,950
control of a lot of coins i think the
real reason they

5554
01:34:22,950 --> 01:34:22,960
real reason they
 

5555
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:25,669
real reason they
sort of felt that they had to undo it

5556
01:34:25,669 --> 01:34:25,679
sort of felt that they had to undo it
 

5557
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:27,189
sort of felt that they had to undo it
was because they'd always plan to move

5558
01:34:27,189 --> 01:34:27,199
was because they'd always plan to move
 

5559
01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:29,350
was because they'd always plan to move
to this proof-of-stake world

5560
01:34:29,350 --> 01:34:29,360
to this proof-of-stake world
 

5561
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:31,030
to this proof-of-stake world
where your political control over the

5562
01:34:31,030 --> 01:34:31,040
where your political control over the
 

5563
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,510
where your political control over the
system is a function of your wealth in

5564
01:34:33,510 --> 01:34:33,520
system is a function of your wealth in
 

5565
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:34,629
system is a function of your wealth in
the system

5566
01:34:34,629 --> 01:34:34,639
the system
 

5567
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:37,110
the system
and they didn't want this attacker which

5568
01:34:37,110 --> 01:34:37,120
and they didn't want this attacker which
 

5569
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:38,310
and they didn't want this attacker which
would have inherited

5570
01:34:38,310 --> 01:34:38,320
would have inherited
 

5571
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,790
would have inherited
all this significant wealth to have

5572
01:34:40,790 --> 01:34:40,800
all this significant wealth to have
 

5573
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:41,990
all this significant wealth to have
influence

5574
01:34:41,990 --> 01:34:42,000
influence
 

5575
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,310
influence
over that future proof of stake version

5576
01:34:44,310 --> 01:34:44,320
over that future proof of stake version
 

5577
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:45,990
over that future proof of stake version
that's sort of my theory

5578
01:34:45,990 --> 01:34:46,000
that's sort of my theory
 

5579
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,109
that's sort of my theory
yeah i mean that makes sense this it

5580
01:34:49,109 --> 01:34:49,119
yeah i mean that makes sense this it
 

5581
01:34:49,119 --> 01:34:50,709
yeah i mean that makes sense this it
kind of reminds me

5582
01:34:50,709 --> 01:34:50,719
kind of reminds me
 

5583
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:54,470
kind of reminds me
of the bailout of car companies

5584
01:34:54,470 --> 01:34:54,480
of the bailout of car companies
 

5585
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,790
of the bailout of car companies
you know this this is difficult there's

5586
01:34:56,790 --> 01:34:56,800
you know this this is difficult there's
 

5587
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:58,470
you know this this is difficult there's
a lot of people that criticize the

5588
01:34:58,470 --> 01:34:58,480
a lot of people that criticize the
 

5589
01:34:58,480 --> 01:34:59,510
a lot of people that criticize the
bailout of these

5590
01:34:59,510 --> 01:34:59,520
bailout of these
 

5591
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:02,149
bailout of these
large companies you know but creative

5592
01:35:02,149 --> 01:35:02,159
large companies you know but creative
 

5593
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:03,590
large companies you know but creative
destruction i mean i

5594
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:03,600
destruction i mean i
 

5595
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:05,590
destruction i mean i
i was critical of the bailouts that

5596
01:35:05,590 --> 01:35:05,600
i was critical of the bailouts that
 

5597
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:06,629
i was critical of the bailouts that
happened

5598
01:35:06,629 --> 01:35:06,639
happened
 

5599
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:09,350
happened
during covid i mean i generally think

5600
01:35:09,350 --> 01:35:09,360
during covid i mean i generally think
 

5601
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:11,590
during covid i mean i generally think
that it's healthier for society for

5602

that it's healthier for society for
 

5603

that it's healthier for society for
bad firms that aren't making money to

5604
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:13,760
bad firms that aren't making money to
 

5605
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:15,830
bad firms that aren't making money to
fail or be reorganized

5606
01:35:15,830 --> 01:35:15,840
fail or be reorganized
 

5607
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:17,750
fail or be reorganized
under the various you know forms of

5608
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:17,760
under the various you know forms of
 

5609
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,189
under the various you know forms of
bankruptcy

5610
01:35:19,189 --> 01:35:19,199
bankruptcy
 

5611
01:35:19,199 --> 01:35:23,030
bankruptcy
and you saw what happens you see the

5612
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:23,040
and you saw what happens you see the
 

5613
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:25,510
and you saw what happens you see the
you know the corporate sector in japan

5614
01:35:25,510 --> 01:35:25,520
you know the corporate sector in japan
 

5615
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,030
you know the corporate sector in japan
uh in the 90s

5616
01:35:27,030 --> 01:35:27,040
uh in the 90s
 

5617
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:28,390
uh in the 90s
there was this like slow motion

5618
01:35:28,390 --> 01:35:28,400
there was this like slow motion
 

5619
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:30,070
there was this like slow motion
insolvency where

5620
01:35:30,070 --> 01:35:30,080
insolvency where
 

5621
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:32,310
insolvency where
basically firms weren't allowed to fail

5622
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:32,320
basically firms weren't allowed to fail
 

5623
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:34,709
basically firms weren't allowed to fail
and the japanese corporate sector lost

5624
01:35:34,709 --> 01:35:34,719
and the japanese corporate sector lost
 

5625
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:36,149
and the japanese corporate sector lost
competitiveness because

5626
01:35:36,149 --> 01:35:36,159
competitiveness because
 

5627
01:35:36,159 --> 01:35:39,270
competitiveness because
bad firms did not fail and so

5628
01:35:39,270 --> 01:35:39,280
bad firms did not fail and so
 

5629
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:40,709
bad firms did not fail and so
you know the process of actual

5630
01:35:40,709 --> 01:35:40,719
you know the process of actual
 

5631
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:42,709
you know the process of actual
capitalism for the market clearing

5632
01:35:42,709 --> 01:35:42,719
capitalism for the market clearing
 

5633
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:44,229
capitalism for the market clearing
didn't occur

5634
01:35:44,229 --> 01:35:44,239
didn't occur
 

5635
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:47,669
didn't occur
so i'm always in support of um

5636
01:35:47,669 --> 01:35:47,679
so i'm always in support of um
 

5637
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:49,030
so i'm always in support of um
you know of the free market being

5638
01:35:49,030 --> 01:35:49,040
you know of the free market being
 

5639
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:51,430
you know of the free market being
allowed to clear for non-profitable

5640
01:35:51,430 --> 01:35:51,440
allowed to clear for non-profitable
 

5641
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:52,870
allowed to clear for non-profitable
firms to fail

5642
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:52,880
firms to fail
 

5643
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:55,910
firms to fail
it's complicated man because uh creative

5644
01:35:55,910 --> 01:35:55,920
it's complicated man because uh creative
 

5645
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:57,669
it's complicated man because uh creative
destruction

5646
01:35:57,669 --> 01:35:57,679
destruction
 

5647
01:35:57,679 --> 01:36:01,270
destruction
seems to be in the long term a positive

5648
01:36:01,270 --> 01:36:01,280
seems to be in the long term a positive
 

5649
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:05,669
seems to be in the long term a positive
but human civilization is such that

5650
01:36:05,669 --> 01:36:05,679
but human civilization is such that
 

5651
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:08,310
but human civilization is such that
short-term pain has real impact on

5652
01:36:08,310 --> 01:36:08,320
short-term pain has real impact on
 

5653
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:09,030
short-term pain has real impact on
people

5654
01:36:09,030 --> 01:36:09,040
people
 

5655
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:11,510
people
you know yeah policymakers don't ever

5656
01:36:11,510 --> 01:36:11,520
you know yeah policymakers don't ever
 

5657
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,189
you know yeah policymakers don't ever
want to incur that short-term pain

5658
01:36:13,189 --> 01:36:13,199
want to incur that short-term pain
 

5659
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:14,870
want to incur that short-term pain
because they have a short-term

5660
01:36:14,870 --> 01:36:14,880
because they have a short-term
 

5661
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:18,149
because they have a short-term
outlook and term limits often

5662
01:36:18,149 --> 01:36:18,159
outlook and term limits often
 

5663
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:21,109
outlook and term limits often
so but and also just it's short-term

5664
01:36:21,109 --> 01:36:21,119
so but and also just it's short-term
 

5665
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:21,669
so but and also just it's short-term
pain

5666
01:36:21,669 --> 01:36:21,679
pain
 

5667
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:23,109
pain
forget policy they just forget

5668
01:36:23,109 --> 01:36:23,119
forget policy they just forget
 

5669
01:36:23,119 --> 01:36:26,870
forget policy they just forget
politicians it sucks to lose a job

5670
01:36:26,870 --> 01:36:26,880
politicians it sucks to lose a job
 

5671
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:30,390
politicians it sucks to lose a job
for an individual you know you could say

5672
01:36:30,390 --> 01:36:30,400
for an individual you know you could say
 

5673
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,229
for an individual you know you could say
the company the creative destruction of

5674
01:36:32,229 --> 01:36:32,239
the company the creative destruction of
 

5675
01:36:32,239 --> 01:36:33,510
the company the creative destruction of
a company

5676
01:36:33,510 --> 01:36:33,520
a company
 

5677
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:35,510
a company
means the company was inefficient and

5678
01:36:35,510 --> 01:36:35,520
means the company was inefficient and
 

5679
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:37,750
means the company was inefficient and
that's going to have a ripple effect

5680
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:37,760
that's going to have a ripple effect
 

5681
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:39,350
that's going to have a ripple effect
of teaching everybody else what an

5682
01:36:39,350 --> 01:36:39,360
of teaching everybody else what an
 

5683
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:41,430
of teaching everybody else what an
efficient operation looks like

5684
01:36:41,430 --> 01:36:41,440
efficient operation looks like
 

5685
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:43,109
efficient operation looks like
but like there's jobs that are being

5686
01:36:43,109 --> 01:36:43,119
but like there's jobs that are being
 

5687
01:36:43,119 --> 01:36:45,189
but like there's jobs that are being
lost there's families that have to

5688
01:36:45,189 --> 01:36:45,199
lost there's families that have to
 

5689
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:47,590
lost there's families that have to
suffer because of that i mean

5690
01:36:47,590 --> 01:36:47,600
suffer because of that i mean
 

5691
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:50,550
suffer because of that i mean
that's attention we live in society is

5692
01:36:50,550 --> 01:36:50,560
that's attention we live in society is
 

5693
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:51,350
that's attention we live in society is
having a

5694
01:36:51,350 --> 01:36:51,360
having a
 

5695
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:55,109
having a
basic safety net for our world um

5696
01:36:55,109 --> 01:36:55,119
basic safety net for our world um
 

5697
01:36:55,119 --> 01:36:58,790
basic safety net for our world um
because there's a level beyond which

5698
01:36:58,790 --> 01:36:58,800
because there's a level beyond which
 

5699
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:01,350
because there's a level beyond which
like if through creative destruction

5700
01:37:01,350 --> 01:37:01,360
like if through creative destruction
 

5701
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:02,229
like if through creative destruction
that you have

5702
01:37:02,229 --> 01:37:02,239
that you have
 

5703
01:37:02,239 --> 01:37:04,149
that you have
some percent of the population that dips

5704
01:37:04,149 --> 01:37:04,159
some percent of the population that dips
 

5705
01:37:04,159 --> 01:37:06,390
some percent of the population that dips
below a certain level that you would

5706
01:37:06,390 --> 01:37:06,400
below a certain level that you would
 

5707
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:06,950
below a certain level that you would
call

5708
01:37:06,950 --> 01:37:06,960
call
 

5709
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:10,070
call
like suffering we don't want that and

5710
01:37:10,070 --> 01:37:10,080
like suffering we don't want that and
 

5711
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:10,950
like suffering we don't want that and
that's a difficult

5712
01:37:10,950 --> 01:37:10,960
that's a difficult
 

5713
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:13,750
that's a difficult
thing to live with like yes in the long

5714
01:37:13,750 --> 01:37:13,760
thing to live with like yes in the long
 

5715
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:15,510
thing to live with like yes in the long
term

5716
01:37:15,510 --> 01:37:15,520
term
 

5717
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:18,470
term
you want inefficiency to be destroyed

5718
01:37:18,470 --> 01:37:18,480
you want inefficiency to be destroyed
 

5719
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:19,109
you want inefficiency to be destroyed
and

5720
01:37:19,109 --> 01:37:19,119
and
 

5721
01:37:19,119 --> 01:37:22,149
and
efficiency to be rewarded but there

5722
01:37:22,149 --> 01:37:22,159
efficiency to be rewarded but there
 

5723
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:24,310
efficiency to be rewarded but there
there does seem to be a base level of

5724
01:37:24,310 --> 01:37:24,320
there does seem to be a base level of
 

5725
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,070
there does seem to be a base level of
like quality of life

5726
01:37:26,070 --> 01:37:26,080
like quality of life
 

5727
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:27,990
like quality of life
that we want to uphold that's a

5728
01:37:27,990 --> 01:37:28,000
that we want to uphold that's a
 

5729
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,590
that we want to uphold that's a
difficult thing to think about i think

5730
01:37:29,590 --> 01:37:29,600
difficult thing to think about i think
 

5731
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,510
difficult thing to think about i think
about that a lot there's a doctor called

5732
01:37:31,510 --> 01:37:31,520
about that a lot there's a doctor called
 

5733
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:35,910
about that a lot there's a doctor called
paul farmer that um

5734
01:37:35,910 --> 01:37:35,920
paul farmer that um
 

5735
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:38,950
paul farmer that um
you know there's like a in in haiti or

5736
01:37:38,950 --> 01:37:38,960
you know there's like a in in haiti or
 

5737
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:41,430
you know there's like a in in haiti or
in africa there's a child who's dying

5738
01:37:41,430 --> 01:37:41,440
in africa there's a child who's dying
 

5739
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:43,430
in africa there's a child who's dying
and as a doctor

5740
01:37:43,430 --> 01:37:43,440
and as a doctor
 

5741
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:45,990
and as a doctor
you want to give everything you have all

5742
01:37:45,990 --> 01:37:46,000
you want to give everything you have all
 

5743
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,669
you want to give everything you have all
the money you have to save that one

5744
01:37:47,669 --> 01:37:47,679
the money you have to save that one
 

5745
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:49,750
the money you have to save that one
child

5746
01:37:49,750 --> 01:37:49,760
child
 

5747
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:52,629
child
but there you know and you do actually

5748
01:37:52,629 --> 01:37:52,639
but there you know and you do actually
 

5749
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:55,350
but there you know and you do actually
but that's uh

5750
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:55,360
but that's uh
 

5751
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:58,310
but that's uh
that's a very human action it's not an

5752
01:37:58,310 --> 01:37:58,320
that's a very human action it's not an
 

5753
01:37:58,320 --> 01:37:59,109
that's a very human action it's not an
economic

5754
01:37:59,109 --> 01:37:59,119
economic
 

5755
01:37:59,119 --> 01:38:01,990
economic
it's not a it's not a rational action

5756
01:38:01,990 --> 01:38:02,000
it's not a it's not a rational action
 

5757
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,510
it's not a it's not a rational action
from a game theoretic perspective

5758
01:38:03,510 --> 01:38:03,520
from a game theoretic perspective
 

5759
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:05,510
from a game theoretic perspective
because there's no way you can take that

5760
01:38:05,510 --> 01:38:05,520
because there's no way you can take that
 

5761
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:07,590
because there's no way you can take that
action for every child who is suffering

5762
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:07,600
action for every child who is suffering
 

5763
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:09,350
action for every child who is suffering
but there's something deeply human about

5764
01:38:09,350 --> 01:38:09,360
but there's something deeply human about
 

5765
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:12,070
but there's something deeply human about
doing that for that one particular child

5766
01:38:12,070 --> 01:38:12,080
doing that for that one particular child
 

5767
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:14,950
doing that for that one particular child
in that same sense creative destruction

5768
01:38:14,950 --> 01:38:14,960
in that same sense creative destruction
 

5769
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:17,510
in that same sense creative destruction
is an economic principle

5770
01:38:17,510 --> 01:38:17,520
is an economic principle
 

5771
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:20,229
is an economic principle
but it's not it's not necessarily that

5772
01:38:20,229 --> 01:38:20,239
but it's not it's not necessarily that
 

5773
01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:22,070
but it's not it's not necessarily that
same kind of human principle

5774
01:38:22,070 --> 01:38:22,080
same kind of human principle
 

5775
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:24,709
same kind of human principle
and there's a tension there i've i see

5776
01:38:24,709 --> 01:38:24,719
and there's a tension there i've i see
 

5777
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:25,990
and there's a tension there i've i see
it i mean i think that's

5778
01:38:25,990 --> 01:38:26,000
it i mean i think that's
 

5779
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,229
it i mean i think that's
the that's the issue with modern central

5780
01:38:28,229 --> 01:38:28,239
the that's the issue with modern central
 

5781
01:38:28,239 --> 01:38:29,750
the that's the issue with modern central
banking really is that

5782
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:29,760
banking really is that
 

5783
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,910
banking really is that
the central bank always has an incentive

5784
01:38:31,910 --> 01:38:31,920
the central bank always has an incentive
 

5785
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:32,870
the central bank always has an incentive
to

5786
01:38:32,870 --> 01:38:32,880
to
 

5787
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:34,709
to
lower interest rates and they've been

5788
01:38:34,709 --> 01:38:34,719
lower interest rates and they've been
 

5789
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:36,390
lower interest rates and they've been
doing that from the 70s

5790
01:38:36,390 --> 01:38:36,400
doing that from the 70s
 

5791
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:38,790
doing that from the 70s
towards today on this you know well 80s

5792
01:38:38,790 --> 01:38:38,800
towards today on this you know well 80s
 

5793
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,870
towards today on this you know well 80s
really on this slow march down

5794
01:38:40,870 --> 01:38:40,880
really on this slow march down
 

5795
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:42,950
really on this slow march down
because whenever there was a hint of a

5796
01:38:42,950 --> 01:38:42,960
because whenever there was a hint of a
 

5797
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:44,709
because whenever there was a hint of a
crisis in the economy

5798
01:38:44,709 --> 01:38:44,719
crisis in the economy
 

5799
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:46,550
crisis in the economy
where financial asset prices started to

5800
01:38:46,550 --> 01:38:46,560
where financial asset prices started to
 

5801
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:48,070
where financial asset prices started to
fall

5802
01:38:48,070 --> 01:38:48,080
fall
 

5803
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:50,229
fall
their reaction is okay we'll inject more

5804
01:38:50,229 --> 01:38:50,239
their reaction is okay we'll inject more
 

5805
01:38:50,239 --> 01:38:52,709
their reaction is okay we'll inject more
capital into the economy we'll save it

5806
01:38:52,709 --> 01:38:52,719
capital into the economy we'll save it
 

5807
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:55,750
capital into the economy we'll save it
but my view is that these political

5808
01:38:55,750 --> 01:38:55,760
but my view is that these political
 

5809
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:57,510
but my view is that these political
short-term measures

5810
01:38:57,510 --> 01:38:57,520
short-term measures
 

5811
01:38:57,520 --> 01:38:58,870
short-term measures
cause the buildup of a huge amount of

5812
01:38:58,870 --> 01:38:58,880
cause the buildup of a huge amount of
 

5813
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:00,870
cause the buildup of a huge amount of
fragility in the long term and then the

5814
01:39:00,870 --> 01:39:00,880
fragility in the long term and then the
 

5815
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:03,270
fragility in the long term and then the
ultimate collapse is much worse

5816
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:03,280
ultimate collapse is much worse
 

5817
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:05,750
ultimate collapse is much worse
than the counterfactual situation where

5818
01:39:05,750 --> 01:39:05,760
than the counterfactual situation where
 

5819
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:07,350
than the counterfactual situation where
you raised interest rates

5820
01:39:07,350 --> 01:39:07,360
you raised interest rates
 

5821
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:10,149
you raised interest rates
you you know you took your medicine and

5822
01:39:10,149 --> 01:39:10,159
you you know you took your medicine and
 

5823
01:39:10,159 --> 01:39:12,149
you you know you took your medicine and
the economy was healthier

5824
01:39:12,149 --> 01:39:12,159
the economy was healthier
 

5825
01:39:12,159 --> 01:39:14,310
the economy was healthier
so and that's sort of that's why you

5826
01:39:14,310 --> 01:39:14,320
so and that's sort of that's why you
 

5827
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:15,510
so and that's sort of that's why you
know people like ray dolly

5828
01:39:15,510 --> 01:39:15,520
know people like ray dolly
 

5829
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:17,430
know people like ray dolly
point out that you have these long-term

5830
01:39:17,430 --> 01:39:17,440
point out that you have these long-term
 

5831
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:18,950
point out that you have these long-term
debt cycles

5832
01:39:18,950 --> 01:39:18,960
debt cycles
 

5833
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:21,350
debt cycles
and we're sort of at the end of one now

5834
01:39:21,350 --> 01:39:21,360
and we're sort of at the end of one now
 

5835
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:23,350
and we're sort of at the end of one now
is because we couldn't

5836
01:39:23,350 --> 01:39:23,360
is because we couldn't
 

5837
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:26,149
is because we couldn't
take our medicine we couldn't you know

5838
01:39:26,149 --> 01:39:26,159
take our medicine we couldn't you know
 

5839
01:39:26,159 --> 01:39:27,990
take our medicine we couldn't you know
let interest rates clear

5840
01:39:27,990 --> 01:39:28,000
let interest rates clear
 

5841
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,870
let interest rates clear
we constantly wanted to ward off any you

5842
01:39:30,870 --> 01:39:30,880
we constantly wanted to ward off any you
 

5843
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:32,629
we constantly wanted to ward off any you
know difficulty and we didn't ever want

5844
01:39:32,629 --> 01:39:32,639
know difficulty and we didn't ever want
 

5845
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:33,830
know difficulty and we didn't ever want
to deleverage

5846
01:39:33,830 --> 01:39:33,840
to deleverage
 

5847
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:37,189
to deleverage
truly and then when the when the debt

5848
01:39:37,189 --> 01:39:37,199
truly and then when the when the debt
 

5849
01:39:37,199 --> 01:39:39,430
truly and then when the when the debt
crisis happens and it hits

5850
01:39:39,430 --> 01:39:39,440
crisis happens and it hits
 

5851
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:43,590
crisis happens and it hits
it's you know horrendously bad

5852
01:39:43,590 --> 01:39:43,600

 

5853
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:46,629

so do you think bitcoin might reach

5854
01:39:46,629 --> 01:39:46,639
so do you think bitcoin might reach
 

5855
01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:49,669
so do you think bitcoin might reach
a million dollars in value it's

5856
01:39:49,669 --> 01:39:49,679
a million dollars in value it's
 

5857
01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:52,550
a million dollars in value it's
uh it's having a current resurgence a

5858
01:39:52,550 --> 01:39:52,560
uh it's having a current resurgence a
 

5859
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:54,070
uh it's having a current resurgence a
crazy one in 2021

5860
01:39:54,070 --> 01:39:54,080
crazy one in 2021
 

5861
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:57,510
crazy one in 2021
in the recent months of uh over 60 000 i

5862
01:39:57,510 --> 01:39:57,520
in the recent months of uh over 60 000 i
 

5863
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:59,189
in the recent months of uh over 60 000 i
guess it is now

5864
01:39:59,189 --> 01:39:59,199
guess it is now
 

5865
01:39:59,199 --> 01:40:00,629
guess it is now
do you think it's possible it goes over

5866
01:40:00,629 --> 01:40:00,639
do you think it's possible it goes over
 

5867
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:01,990
do you think it's possible it goes over
a hundred thousand do you think it's

5868
01:40:01,990 --> 01:40:02,000
a hundred thousand do you think it's
 

5869
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,350
a hundred thousand do you think it's
possible goes to a million

5870
01:40:03,350 --> 01:40:03,360
possible goes to a million
 

5871
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:06,310
possible goes to a million
you can't rule anything out with bitcoin

5872
01:40:06,310 --> 01:40:06,320
you can't rule anything out with bitcoin
 

5873
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:06,709
you can't rule anything out with bitcoin
so

5874
01:40:06,709 --> 01:40:06,719
so
 

5875
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:08,470
so
i mean i'm not you know wanted to put

5876
01:40:08,470 --> 01:40:08,480
i mean i'm not you know wanted to put
 

5877
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:10,390
i mean i'm not you know wanted to put
price targets on it but

5878
01:40:10,390 --> 01:40:10,400
price targets on it but
 

5879
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:12,229
price targets on it but
one way it could reach a million dollars

5880
01:40:12,229 --> 01:40:12,239
one way it could reach a million dollars
 

5881
01:40:12,239 --> 01:40:14,470
one way it could reach a million dollars
is bitcoin's value stays unchanged in

5882
01:40:14,470 --> 01:40:14,480
is bitcoin's value stays unchanged in
 

5883
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:15,189
is bitcoin's value stays unchanged in
real terms

5884
01:40:15,189 --> 01:40:15,199
real terms
 

5885
01:40:15,199 --> 01:40:17,350
real terms
and dollars crashes all it appreciates

5886
01:40:17,350 --> 01:40:17,360
and dollars crashes all it appreciates
 

5887
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:19,669
and dollars crashes all it appreciates
against

5888

against
 

5889
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:22,229
against
um not that i expect hyperinflation but

5890
01:40:22,229 --> 01:40:22,239
um not that i expect hyperinflation but
 

5891
01:40:22,239 --> 01:40:22,950
um not that i expect hyperinflation but
yeah i mean

5892
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:22,960
yeah i mean
 

5893
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:25,270
yeah i mean
look bitcoin is worth about one tenth uh

5894
01:40:25,270 --> 01:40:25,280
look bitcoin is worth about one tenth uh
 

5895
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:26,709
look bitcoin is worth about one tenth uh
slightly under one tenth the value of

do you think it become it can become

5936
01:41:09,590 --> 01:41:09,600
do you think it become it can become
 

5937
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:11,189
do you think it become it can become
like the base layer for a lot of our

5938
01:41:11,189 --> 01:41:11,199
like the base layer for a lot of our
 

5939
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:13,590
like the base layer for a lot of our
financial operation like you become

5940
01:41:13,590 --> 01:41:13,600
financial operation like you become
 

5941
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,669
financial operation like you become
the main base layer for all our

5942
01:41:15,669 --> 01:41:15,679
the main base layer for all our
 

5943
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:18,229
the main base layer for all our
transactions so like even

5944
01:41:18,229 --> 01:41:18,239
transactions so like even
 

5945
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:20,950
transactions so like even
banks will use bitcoin essentially and

5946
01:41:20,950 --> 01:41:20,960
banks will use bitcoin essentially and
 

5947
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:22,550
banks will use bitcoin essentially and
like visa would use bitcoin

5948
01:41:22,550 --> 01:41:22,560
like visa would use bitcoin
 

5949
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,310
like visa would use bitcoin
as the base there like it would actually

5950
01:41:24,310 --> 01:41:24,320
as the base there like it would actually
 

5951
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:26,070
as the base there like it would actually
operate very similarly at the

5952
01:41:26,070 --> 01:41:26,080
operate very similarly at the
 

5953
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:28,229
operate very similarly at the
at the surface layer but at the base

5954
01:41:28,229 --> 01:41:28,239
at the surface layer but at the base
 

5955
01:41:28,239 --> 01:41:29,830
at the surface layer but at the base
there would all be bitcoin

5956
01:41:29,830 --> 01:41:29,840
there would all be bitcoin
 

5957
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:31,750
there would all be bitcoin
that's precisely what i expect and banks

5958
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:31,760
that's precisely what i expect and banks
 

5959
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:34,310
that's precisely what i expect and banks
and visa are already using bitcoin

5960
01:41:34,310 --> 01:41:34,320
and visa are already using bitcoin
 

5961
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:37,510
and visa are already using bitcoin
so visa has uh

5962
01:41:37,510 --> 01:41:37,520
so visa has uh
 

5963
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:39,189
so visa has uh
embraced bitcoin in a really big way

5964
01:41:39,189 --> 01:41:39,199
embraced bitcoin in a really big way
 

5965
01:41:39,199 --> 01:41:40,790
embraced bitcoin in a really big way
actually and it's always funny to the

5966
01:41:40,790 --> 01:41:40,800
actually and it's always funny to the
 

5967
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:42,470
actually and it's always funny to the
people saying bitcoin has to

5968
01:41:42,470 --> 01:41:42,480
people saying bitcoin has to
 

5969
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:43,830
people saying bitcoin has to
change in a certain way so you can

5970
01:41:43,830 --> 01:41:43,840
change in a certain way so you can
 

5971
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:46,790
change in a certain way so you can
compete with visa no visa adopted

5972
01:41:46,790 --> 01:41:46,800
compete with visa no visa adopted
 

5973
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:47,750
compete with visa no visa adopted

right uh paypal adopted bitcoin
square adopted bitcoin obviously they're

5978
01:41:53,510 --> 01:41:53,520
square adopted bitcoin obviously they're
 

5979
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:55,189

not tearing out all of their existing
 

5981
01:41:55,199 --> 01:41:56,790
not tearing out all of their existing
infrastructure but

5982
01:41:56,790 --> 01:41:56,800
infrastructure but
 

5983
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:59,270
infrastructure but
they're totally engaging with this thing

5984
01:41:59,270 --> 01:41:59,280
they're totally engaging with this thing
 

5985
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:00,149
they're totally engaging with this thing
uh banks

5986
01:42:00,149 --> 01:42:00,159
uh banks
 

5987
01:42:00,159 --> 01:42:02,470
uh banks
have now begun they got the green light

5988
01:42:02,470 --> 01:42:02,480
have now begun they got the green light
 

5989
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:03,910
have now begun they got the green light
to provide custody

5990
01:42:03,910 --> 01:42:03,920
to provide custody
 

5991
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:06,070
to provide custody
for bitcoin for their depositors that's

5992
01:42:06,070 --> 01:42:06,080
for bitcoin for their depositors that's
 

5993
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,430
for bitcoin for their depositors that's
the first step

5994
01:42:07,430 --> 01:42:07,440
the first step
 

5995
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:10,310
the first step
uh eventually like you know it'll happen

5996
01:42:10,310 --> 01:42:10,320
uh eventually like you know it'll happen
 

5997
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:12,310
uh eventually like you know it'll happen
one of two ways either bitcoin native

5998
01:42:12,310 --> 01:42:12,320
one of two ways either bitcoin native
 

5999
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:14,070
one of two ways either bitcoin native

6003
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:17,990
banks that's already happening there's
bitcoin exchanges that have gotten

6004
01:42:17,990 --> 01:42:18,000
bitcoin exchanges that have gotten
 

6005

fork of bitcoin it's unmaintained
 

6353
01:48:08,719 --> 01:48:10,709
fork of bitcoin it's unmaintained
they're you know it's probably at risk

6354
01:48:10,709 --> 01:48:10,719
they're you know it's probably at risk
 

6355
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:13,430
they're you know it's probably at risk
actually from a protocol perspective

6356
01:48:13,430 --> 01:48:13,440
actually from a protocol perspective
 

6357
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:16,310
actually from a protocol perspective
it's merge mined with litecoin i think

6358
01:48:16,310 --> 01:48:16,320
it's merge mined with litecoin i think
 

6359
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:17,350
it's merge mined with litecoin i think
um

6360
01:48:17,350 --> 01:48:17,360
um
 

6361
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:18,709
um
if there was an inflation bug on

6362
01:48:18,709 --> 01:48:18,719
if there was an inflation bug on
 

6363
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:20,950
if there was an inflation bug on
dogecoin it's unclear who would sort of

6364
01:48:20,950 --> 01:48:20,960
dogecoin it's unclear who would sort of
 

6365
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:22,790
dogecoin it's unclear who would sort of
be able to remediate that

6366
01:48:22,790 --> 01:48:22,800
be able to remediate that
 

6367
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:25,669
be able to remediate that
you know so it's not technologically

6368
01:48:25,669 --> 01:48:25,679
you know so it's not technologically
 

6369
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:26,950
you know so it's not technologically
very sound

6370
01:48:26,950 --> 01:48:26,960
very sound
 

6371
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:29,350
very sound
um so i wouldn't recommend that anyone

6372
01:48:29,350 --> 01:48:29,360
um so i wouldn't recommend that anyone
 

6373
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:30,790
um so i wouldn't recommend that anyone
stores wealth in it

6374
01:48:30,790 --> 01:48:30,800
stores wealth in it
 

6375
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:32,790
stores wealth in it
you know yes it's funny because

6376
01:48:32,790 --> 01:48:32,800
you know yes it's funny because
 

6377
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:34,629
you know yes it's funny because
cryptocurrency

6378
01:48:34,629 --> 01:48:34,639
cryptocurrency
 

6379
01:48:34,639 --> 01:48:37,430
cryptocurrency
like my interest in cryptocurrency is in

6380
01:48:37,430 --> 01:48:37,440
like my interest in cryptocurrency is in
 

6381
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:40,550
like my interest in cryptocurrency is in
the exploration of technical ideas

6382
01:48:40,550 --> 01:48:40,560
the exploration of technical ideas
 

6383
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:43,430
the exploration of technical ideas
but cryptocurrency is also like in the

6384
01:48:43,430 --> 01:48:43,440
but cryptocurrency is also like in the
 

6385
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:45,109
but cryptocurrency is also like in the
case of dogecoin

6386
01:48:45,109 --> 01:48:45,119
case of dogecoin
 

6387
01:48:45,119 --> 01:48:48,550
case of dogecoin
uh like for lols at least

6388
01:48:48,550 --> 01:48:48,560
uh like for lols at least
 

6389
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:51,669
uh like for lols at least
originally like a meme coin but it's

6390
01:48:51,669 --> 01:48:51,679
originally like a meme coin but it's
 

6391
01:48:51,679 --> 01:48:56,629
originally like a meme coin but it's
also a uh mechanism for investment

6392
01:48:56,629 --> 01:48:56,639
also a uh mechanism for investment
 

6393
01:48:56,639 --> 01:49:00,870
also a uh mechanism for investment
and so those are sometimes attention

6394
01:49:00,870 --> 01:49:00,880
and so those are sometimes attention
 

6395
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:04,629
and so those are sometimes attention
100 and it's unclear sort of like yeah

6396
01:49:04,629 --> 01:49:04,639
100 and it's unclear sort of like yeah
 

6397
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:06,709
100 and it's unclear sort of like yeah
you know there's the meme with those

6398
01:49:06,709 --> 01:49:06,719
you know there's the meme with those
 

6399
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:08,390
you know there's the meme with those
just almost become to take it to

6400
01:49:08,390 --> 01:49:08,400
just almost become to take it to
 

6401
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:10,790
just almost become to take it to
i guess to a dollar trying to drive the

6402
01:49:10,790 --> 01:49:10,800
i guess to a dollar trying to drive the
 

6403
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:13,350
i guess to a dollar trying to drive the
price of the value up to a dollar

6404
01:49:13,350 --> 01:49:13,360
price of the value up to a dollar
 

6405
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:15,990
price of the value up to a dollar
but you know implied in that is like

6406
01:49:15,990 --> 01:49:16,000
but you know implied in that is like
 

6407
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,669
but you know implied in that is like
this overlap of the meme

6408
01:49:17,669 --> 01:49:17,679
this overlap of the meme
 

6409
01:49:17,679 --> 01:49:20,390
this overlap of the meme
coin and like legitimate investment and

6410
01:49:20,390 --> 01:49:20,400
coin and like legitimate investment and
 

6411
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:22,149
coin and like legitimate investment and
so you have a lot of young people i

6412
01:49:22,149 --> 01:49:22,159
so you have a lot of young people i
 

6413
01:49:22,159 --> 01:49:22,950
so you have a lot of young people i
think

6414
01:49:22,950 --> 01:49:22,960
think
 

6415
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:26,470
think
who almost start getting greedy and want

6416
01:49:26,470 --> 01:49:26,480
who almost start getting greedy and want
 

6417
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:29,669
who almost start getting greedy and want
to make money like as opposed to

6418
01:49:29,669 --> 01:49:29,679
to make money like as opposed to
 

6419
01:49:29,679 --> 01:49:32,310
to make money like as opposed to
uh having fun and that becomes a

6420
01:49:32,310 --> 01:49:32,320
uh having fun and that becomes a
 

6421
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:33,750
uh having fun and that becomes a
different beast then because you're

6422
01:49:33,750 --> 01:49:33,760
different beast then because you're
 

6423
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:36,070
different beast then because you're
essentially

6424
01:49:36,070 --> 01:49:36,080
essentially
 

6425
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:38,229
essentially
making financial decisions that can have

6426
01:49:38,229 --> 01:49:38,239
making financial decisions that can have
 

6427
01:49:38,239 --> 01:49:39,350
making financial decisions that can have
a long lasting

6428
01:49:39,350 --> 01:49:39,360
a long lasting
 

6429
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:42,790
a long lasting
like you know money is freedom

6430
01:49:42,790 --> 01:49:42,800
like you know money is freedom
 

6431
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:46,229
like you know money is freedom
and uh if you make stupid financial

6432
01:49:46,229 --> 01:49:46,239
and uh if you make stupid financial
 

6433
01:49:46,239 --> 01:49:47,750
and uh if you make stupid financial
decisions

6434
01:49:47,750 --> 01:49:47,760
decisions
 

6435
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:50,070
decisions
it you can remove freedom from your life

6436
01:49:50,070 --> 01:49:50,080
it you can remove freedom from your life
 

6437
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:50,870
it you can remove freedom from your life
and that's

6438
01:49:50,870 --> 01:49:50,880
and that's
 

6439
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:53,030
and that's
it could be detrimental in that sense so

6440
01:49:53,030 --> 01:49:53,040
it could be detrimental in that sense so
 

6441
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:54,950
it could be detrimental in that sense so
i don't uh

6442
01:49:54,950 --> 01:49:54,960
i don't uh
 

6443
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:56,070
i don't uh
it's difficult i don't know what to do

6444
01:49:56,070 --> 01:49:56,080
it's difficult i don't know what to do
 

6445
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:58,709
it's difficult i don't know what to do
with that with that set of ideas because

6446
01:49:58,709 --> 01:49:58,719
with that with that set of ideas because
 

6447
01:49:58,719 --> 01:50:00,070
with that with that set of ideas because
a lot of cryptocurrency including

6448
01:50:00,070 --> 01:50:00,080
a lot of cryptocurrency including
 

6449
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:01,910
a lot of cryptocurrency including
bitcoin is very volatile

6450
01:50:01,910 --> 01:50:01,920
bitcoin is very volatile
 

6451
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:05,350
bitcoin is very volatile
because it's new so you're trying to

6452
01:50:05,350 --> 01:50:05,360
because it's new so you're trying to
 

6453
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:07,270
because it's new so you're trying to
figure out the space of like

6454
01:50:07,270 --> 01:50:07,280
figure out the space of like
 

6455
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:10,229
figure out the space of like
what's actually going to be a large part

6456
01:50:10,229 --> 01:50:10,239
what's actually going to be a large part
 

6457
01:50:10,239 --> 01:50:11,350
what's actually going to be a large part
of

6458
01:50:11,350 --> 01:50:11,360
of
 

6459
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:13,030
of
like you speak of network effects like

6460
01:50:13,030 --> 01:50:13,040
like you speak of network effects like
 

6461
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:15,350
like you speak of network effects like
what's going to take over the world

6462
01:50:15,350 --> 01:50:15,360
what's going to take over the world
 

6463
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:17,030
what's going to take over the world
and uh through that process there's

6464
01:50:17,030 --> 01:50:17,040
and uh through that process there's
 

6465
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:19,109
and uh through that process there's
going to be a lot of volatility

6466
01:50:19,109 --> 01:50:19,119
going to be a lot of volatility
 

6467
01:50:19,119 --> 01:50:21,910
going to be a lot of volatility
and if you're talking about

6468
01:50:21,910 --> 01:50:21,920
and if you're talking about
 

6469
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:22,870
and if you're talking about
cryptocurrency

6470
01:50:22,870 --> 01:50:22,880
cryptocurrency
 

6471
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:26,870
cryptocurrency
as a investment mechanism

6472
01:50:26,870 --> 01:50:26,880
as a investment mechanism
 

6473
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:29,030
as a investment mechanism
then it can have a real detrimental

6474
01:50:29,030 --> 01:50:29,040
then it can have a real detrimental
 

6475
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:31,109
then it can have a real detrimental
effects on people's lives

6476
01:50:31,109 --> 01:50:31,119
effects on people's lives
 

6477
01:50:31,119 --> 01:50:33,589
effects on people's lives
yeah and that's really the challenge

6478
01:50:33,589 --> 01:50:33,599
yeah and that's really the challenge
 

6479
01:50:33,599 --> 01:50:35,430
yeah and that's really the challenge
with operating in the crypto space

6480
01:50:35,430 --> 01:50:35,440
with operating in the crypto space
 

6481
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:38,709
with operating in the crypto space
talking about it overlaid on top of

6482
01:50:38,709 --> 01:50:38,719
talking about it overlaid on top of
 

6483
01:50:38,719 --> 01:50:39,910
talking about it overlaid on top of
everything that's interesting

6484
01:50:39,910 --> 01:50:39,920
everything that's interesting
 

6485
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:42,070
everything that's interesting
politically or culturally about it is

6486
01:50:42,070 --> 01:50:42,080
politically or culturally about it is
 

6487
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:43,430
politically or culturally about it is
the financial incentive

6488
01:50:43,430 --> 01:50:43,440
the financial incentive
 

6489
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:46,629
the financial incentive
yeah and so you know it's not

6490
01:50:46,629 --> 01:50:46,639
yeah and so you know it's not
 

6491
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:48,870
yeah and so you know it's not
all fun and games because they're

6492
01:50:48,870 --> 01:50:48,880
all fun and games because they're
 

6493
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:50,709
all fun and games because they're
literally billions

6494
01:50:50,709 --> 01:50:50,719
literally billions
 

6495
01:50:50,719 --> 01:50:54,310
literally billions
over a trillion dollars at stake now so

6496
01:50:54,310 --> 01:50:54,320
over a trillion dollars at stake now so
 

6497
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:56,149
over a trillion dollars at stake now so
if you buy dogecoin because some

6498
01:50:56,149 --> 01:50:56,159
if you buy dogecoin because some
 

6499
01:50:56,159 --> 01:50:58,070
if you buy dogecoin because some
influence around tick tock said so

6500
01:50:58,070 --> 01:50:58,080
influence around tick tock said so
 

6501
01:50:58,080 --> 01:51:00,149
influence around tick tock said so
yeah you've now made a financial

6502
01:51:00,149 --> 01:51:00,159
yeah you've now made a financial

see
 

6567
01:52:08,239 --> 01:52:11,109
see
the growth there in that sector is

6568
01:52:11,109 --> 01:52:11,119
the growth there in that sector is
 

6569
01:52:11,119 --> 01:52:13,030
the growth there in that sector is
partially a function of where we are

6570
01:52:13,030 --> 01:52:13,040
partially a function of where we are
 

6571
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:16,229
partially a function of where we are
in the actual credit cycle so

6572
01:52:16,229 --> 01:52:16,239
in the actual credit cycle so
 

6573
01:52:16,239 --> 01:52:18,550
in the actual credit cycle so
oftentimes when inflationary events

01:52:18,550 --> 01:52:18,560
oftentimes when inflationary events
 

6575
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:19,430
oftentimes when inflationary events
occur

6576
01:52:19,430 --> 01:52:19,440
occur
 

6577
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:21,270
occur
you have correspondent speculative

6578
01:52:21,270 --> 01:52:21,280
you have correspondent speculative
 

6579
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:23,030
you have correspondent speculative
manias that

6580
01:52:23,030 --> 01:52:23,040
manias that
 

6581
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:24,870
manias that
occur at the same time because people

6582
01:52:24,870 --> 01:52:24,880
occur at the same time because people
 

6583
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:26,470
occur at the same time because people
intuitively feel

6584
01:52:26,470 --> 01:52:26,480
intuitively feel
 

6585
01:52:26,480 --> 01:52:28,870
intuitively feel
that the fiat currency that they hold is

6586
01:52:28,870 --> 01:52:28,880
that the fiat currency that they hold is
 

6587
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:30,070
that the fiat currency that they hold is
being debased

6588
01:52:30,070 --> 01:52:30,080
being debased
 

6589
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:31,910
being debased
and so they frantically look around for

6590
01:52:31,910 --> 01:52:31,920
and so they frantically look around for
 

6591
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:33,910
and so they frantically look around for
other places to put it so

6592
01:52:33,910 --> 01:52:33,920
other places to put it so
 

6593
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:38,550
other places to put it so
stocks property commodities

6594
01:52:38,550 --> 01:52:38,560
stocks property commodities
 

6595
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:41,750
stocks property commodities
and then other asset classes

6596
01:52:41,750 --> 01:52:41,760
and then other asset classes
 

6597
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:44,790
and then other asset classes
nfts are an asset class and this is the

6598
01:52:44,790 --> 01:52:44,800
nfts are an asset class and this is the
 

6599
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:45,430
nfts are an asset class and this is the
case with

6600
01:52:45,430 --> 01:52:45,440
case with
 

6601
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:48,229
case with
any inflation you look at in history you

6602
01:52:48,229 --> 01:52:48,239
any inflation you look at in history you
 

6603
01:52:48,239 --> 01:52:50,229
any inflation you look at in history you
saw these corresponds speculative

6604
01:52:50,229 --> 01:52:50,239
saw these corresponds speculative
 

6605
01:52:50,239 --> 01:52:53,830
saw these corresponds speculative
manias basically speculative episodes

6606
01:52:53,830 --> 01:52:53,840
manias basically speculative episodes
 

6607
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:56,550
manias basically speculative episodes
so a lot of us feel that inflation is

6608
01:52:56,550 --> 01:52:56,560
so a lot of us feel that inflation is
 

6609
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:57,350
so a lot of us feel that inflation is
occurring

6610
01:52:57,350 --> 01:52:57,360
occurring
 

6611
01:52:57,360 --> 01:52:59,910
occurring
whether it's in cpi or not the basically

6612
01:52:59,910 --> 01:52:59,920
whether it's in cpi or not the basically
 

6613
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:01,510
whether it's in cpi or not the basically
lots of dollars are being injected into

6614
01:53:01,510 --> 01:53:01,520
lots of dollars are being injected into
 

6615
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:02,790
lots of dollars are being injected into
the economy

6616
01:53:02,790 --> 01:53:02,800
the economy
 

6617
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:04,709
the economy
we've all seen stocks massively

6618
01:53:04,709 --> 01:53:04,719
we've all seen stocks massively
 

6619
01:53:04,719 --> 01:53:07,510
we've all seen stocks massively
appreciate even as gdp contracted

6620
01:53:07,510 --> 01:53:07,520
appreciate even as gdp contracted
 

6621
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:10,070
appreciate even as gdp contracted
and so a lot of people sort of got

6622
01:53:10,070 --> 01:53:10,080
and so a lot of people sort of got
 

6623
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:12,470
and so a lot of people sort of got
caught on to this notion that

6624
01:53:12,470 --> 01:53:12,480
caught on to this notion that
 

6625
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:14,390
caught on to this notion that
wow as the fed you know lowers interest

6626
01:53:14,390 --> 01:53:14,400
wow as the fed you know lowers interest
 

6627
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:15,830
wow as the fed you know lowers interest
rates and

6628
01:53:15,830 --> 01:53:15,840

6629
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:17,830
rates and
congress spends a huge amount of

6631
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:19,510
congress spends a huge amount of
stimulus dollars into the economy

6632
01:53:19,510 --> 01:53:19,520
stimulus dollars into the economy
 

6633
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:21,030
stimulus dollars into the economy
financial assets going to go up so i

6634
01:53:21,030 --> 01:53:21,040
financial assets going to go up so i
 

6635
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:23,750
financial assets going to go up so i
better have exposure to all that stuff

6636
01:53:23,750 --> 01:53:23,760
better have exposure to all that stuff
 

6637
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:26,470
better have exposure to all that stuff
and so you see virtually every asset

6638
01:53:26,470 --> 01:53:26,480
and so you see virtually every asset
 

6639
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:28,470
and so you see virtually every asset

6661
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:49,189
their valuations have been skyrocketing
and so i think nfts are part of that

6662
01:53:49,189 --> 01:53:49,199
and so i think nfts are part of that
 

6663
01:53:49,199 --> 01:53:51,350
and so i think nfts are part of that

novel asset class that people can trade
 

6679
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:11,589
novel asset class that people can trade
and right as you know these inflationary

6680
01:54:11,589 --> 01:54:11,599
and right as you know these inflationary
 

6681
01:54:11,599 --> 01:54:13,510
and right as you know these inflationary
tailwinds pick up

6682
01:54:13,510 --> 01:54:13,520
tailwinds pick up
 

6683
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:15,910
tailwinds pick up
now as for the sort of virtues of the

6684
01:54:15,910 --> 01:54:15,920
now as for the sort of virtues of the
 

6685
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:17,910
now as for the sort of virtues of the
actual technical

phenomenon nfts are actually not a new
 

6689
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:21,669
phenomenon nfts are actually not a new
idea at all

6690

so you've had nfts i didn't call them

6692
01:54:24,629 --> 01:54:24,639
so you've had nfts i didn't call them
 

6693
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:25,589
so you've had nfts i didn't call them
nfts but

6694
01:54:25,589 --> 01:54:25,599
nfts but
 

6695
01:54:25,599 --> 01:54:28,390
nfts but
in 2016 built on bitcoin for instance so

6696
01:54:28,390 --> 01:54:28,400
in 2016 built on bitcoin for instance so
 

6697
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:30,149
in 2016 built on bitcoin for instance so
it's been around for a while

6698
01:54:30,149 --> 01:54:30,159
it's been around for a while
 

6699
01:54:30,159 --> 01:54:33,750
it's been around for a while
what it is is a serial code basically

6700
01:54:33,750 --> 01:54:33,760
what it is is a serial code basically
 

6701
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:37,430
what it is is a serial code basically
a string of data that is inserted onto a

6702
01:54:37,430 --> 01:54:37,440
a string of data that is inserted onto a
 

6703
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:38,629
a string of data that is inserted onto a
public blockchain

6704
01:54:38,629 --> 01:54:38,639
public blockchain
 

6705
01:54:38,639 --> 01:54:41,270
public blockchain
and then circulates as a unique token

6706
01:54:41,270 --> 01:54:41,280
and then circulates as a unique token
 

6707
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:42,310
and then circulates as a unique token
and then the question is

6708
01:54:42,310 --> 01:54:42,320
and then the question is
 

6709
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:44,390
and then the question is
okay well what does that data refer to

6710
01:54:44,390 --> 01:54:44,400
okay well what does that data refer to
 

6711
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:46,229
okay well what does that data refer to
what's the external reference

6712
01:54:46,229 --> 01:54:46,239
what's the external reference
 

6713
01:54:46,239 --> 01:54:48,070
what's the external reference
and that has to be defined there has to

6714
01:54:48,070 --> 01:54:48,080
and that has to be defined there has to
 

6715
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:50,390
and that has to be defined there has to
be some entity which says oh yeah this

6716
01:54:50,390 --> 01:54:50,400
be some entity which says oh yeah this

01:55:54,149 --> 01:55:54,159
i wonder if there's ideas like big cloud
 

6773
01:55:54,159 --> 01:55:55,669
i wonder if there's ideas like big cloud
for example i don't know if you saw that

01:55:55,669 --> 01:55:55,679
for example i don't know if you saw that
 

6775
01:55:55,679 --> 01:55:57,589
for example i don't know if you saw that
if there's ideas built on top of this

but
 

6797
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:23,270
but
like staking identity in some way

6798
01:56:23,270 --> 01:56:23,280
like staking identity in some way
 

6799
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:24,709
like staking identity in some way
whether it's big cloud or

whether it's big cloud or
 

6801
01:56:24,719 --> 01:56:27,430
whether it's big cloud or
identity of objects like there might be

some way
 

6805
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,310
some way
of connecting physical reality and

6806
01:56:30,310 --> 01:56:30,320
of connecting physical reality and
 

6807
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:33,109
of connecting physical reality and
digital reality in some interesting ways

6808

digital reality in some interesting ways
 

6809
01:56:33,119 --> 01:56:36,070
digital reality in some interesting ways
so just the financial aspect is a way to

6810

like put
 

6813
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:41,189
like put
some validity behind the identity

6814
01:56:41,189 --> 01:56:41,199
some validity behind the identity
 

6815
01:56:41,199 --> 01:56:43,189
some validity behind the identity
i don't i wonder if there's like ideas

6816
01:56:43,189 --> 01:56:43,199
i don't i wonder if there's like ideas
 

6817
01:56:43,199 --> 01:56:45,189
i don't i wonder if there's like ideas
there that are yet to be

6818
01:56:45,189 --> 01:56:45,199
there that are yet to be
 

6819
01:56:45,199 --> 01:56:48,709
there that are yet to be
discovered or ideas that

6820
01:56:48,709 --> 01:56:48,719
discovered or ideas that
 

6821
01:56:48,719 --> 01:56:51,589
discovered or ideas that
yet to be take hold like big clout seems

6822
01:56:51,589 --> 01:56:51,599
yet to be take hold like big clout seems
 

6823
01:56:51,599 --> 01:56:53,510
yet to be take hold like big clout seems
interesting yeah it seems shady as hell

6824

yeah i think my market cap on big cloud

6832
01:57:03,910 --> 01:57:03,920
yeah i think my market cap on big cloud
 

6833
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:05,270
yeah i think my market cap on big cloud
is like 90 000

6834

that matter
 

7001
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:20,709
that matter
so my chosen approach is the approach

7002
02:00:20,709 --> 02:00:20,719
so my chosen approach is the approach
 

7003
02:00:20,719 --> 02:00:21,750
so my chosen approach is the approach
you see here

7004
02:00:21,750 --> 02:00:21,760
you see here
 

7005
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:25,030
you see here
which i try to minimize the amount of

which i try to minimize the amount of

the bitcoin community at first i was off

02:00:52,950 --> 02:00:52,960
the bitcoin community at first i was off
 

7035
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:53,510
the bitcoin community at first i was off
put

7036
02:00:53,510 --> 02:00:53,520
put
 

7037
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:56,310
put
yeah in terms of the intensity the

7038
02:00:56,310 --> 02:00:56,320
yeah in terms of the intensity the
 

7039
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:57,109

mockery
 

7041
02:00:57,119 --> 02:01:02,070
mockery
i bet the layers of lull

7042
02:01:02,070 --> 02:01:02,080

 

7043
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:04,229

like the layers of not taking anything

7044
02:01:04,229 --> 02:01:04,239
like the layers of not taking anything
 

7045
02:01:04,239 --> 02:01:05,589
like the layers of not taking anything
seriously

7046
02:01:05,589 --> 02:01:05,599
seriously
 

7047
02:01:05,599 --> 02:01:08,390
seriously
and i think there's power to that

7048
02:01:08,390 --> 02:01:08,400
and i think there's power to that
 

7049
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:10,629
and i think there's power to that
there's freedom to that i appreciate it

7050
02:01:10,629 --> 02:01:10,639
there's freedom to that i appreciate it
 

7051
02:01:10,639 --> 02:01:14,070
there's freedom to that i appreciate it
i have respect for it but it's not my

7068
02:01:27,350 --> 02:01:27,360
anymore it's great
 

7069
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:29,990
anymore it's great
but i i totally can see the point i wish

7070
02:01:29,990 --> 02:01:30,000
but i i totally can see the point i wish
 

7071
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:30,709
but i i totally can see the point i wish
that

7072
02:01:30,709 --> 02:01:30,719
that
 

7073
02:01:30,719 --> 02:01:33,189
that
bitcoiners were gentler in their

7074
02:01:33,189 --> 02:01:33,199
bitcoiners were gentler in their
 

7075
02:01:33,199 --> 02:01:34,149
bitcoiners were gentler in their
approach

7076
02:01:34,149 --> 02:01:34,159
approach
 

7077
02:01:34,159 --> 02:01:35,669
approach
not all bitcoiners are like that of

7078
02:01:35,669 --> 02:01:35,679
not all bitcoiners are like that of
 

7079
02:01:35,679 --> 02:01:37,830
not all bitcoiners are like that of
course there's you know 50 to 100

7080
02:01:37,830 --> 02:01:37,840
course there's you know 50 to 100
 

7081
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:39,510
course there's you know 50 to 100
million of them worldwide

7082
02:01:39,510 --> 02:01:39,520
million of them worldwide
 

7083
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:42,310
million of them worldwide
and a few tens of thousands on twitter

7084
02:01:42,310 --> 02:01:42,320
and a few tens of thousands on twitter
 

7085
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:43,189
and a few tens of thousands on twitter
so

7086
02:01:43,189 --> 02:01:43,199
so
 

7087
02:01:43,199 --> 02:01:44,229
so
i'm not going to claim that they're

7088
02:01:44,229 --> 02:01:44,239
i'm not going to claim that they're
 

7089
02:01:44,239 --> 02:01:47,189
i'm not going to claim that they're
necessarily representative the toxicity

7090
02:01:47,189 --> 02:01:47,199
necessarily representative the toxicity
 

7091
02:01:47,199 --> 02:01:48,070
necessarily representative the toxicity
though

7092
02:01:48,070 --> 02:01:48,080
though
 

7093
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:51,270
though
is kind of a learned habit because

7094
02:01:51,270 --> 02:01:51,280
is kind of a learned habit because
 

7095
02:01:51,280 --> 02:01:53,830
is kind of a learned habit because
uh bitcoin has had so many episodes

7096
02:01:53,830 --> 02:01:53,840
uh bitcoin has had so many episodes
 

7097
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:55,109
uh bitcoin has had so many episodes
where

7098
02:01:55,109 --> 02:01:55,119
where
 

7099
02:01:55,119 --> 02:01:57,589
where
strong willed institutions the dice

7100
02:01:57,589 --> 02:01:57,599
strong willed institutions the dice
 

7101
02:01:57,599 --> 02:01:58,550
strong willed institutions the dice
billionaires

7102
02:01:58,550 --> 02:01:58,560
billionaires
 

7103
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:00,870
billionaires
the dice were pretty toxic you could say

7104
02:02:00,870 --> 02:02:00,880
the dice were pretty toxic you could say
 

7105
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:01,669
the dice were pretty toxic you could say
right i'm

7106
02:02:01,669 --> 02:02:01,679
right i'm
 

7107
02:02:01,679 --> 02:02:04,629
right i'm
basically mocking critics of bitcoin but

7108
02:02:04,629 --> 02:02:04,639
basically mocking critics of bitcoin but
 

7109
02:02:04,639 --> 02:02:05,910
basically mocking critics of bitcoin but
at the same time

7110
02:02:05,910 --> 02:02:05,920
at the same time
 

7111
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:07,510
at the same time
you're saying that the criticism has

7112
02:02:07,510 --> 02:02:07,520
you're saying that the criticism has
 

7113
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:09,589
you're saying that the criticism has
been predictable and repeatable and all

7114
02:02:09,589 --> 02:02:09,599
been predictable and repeatable and all
 

7115
02:02:09,599 --> 02:02:12,550
been predictable and repeatable and all
it's been the same throughout yeah and

7116
02:02:12,550 --> 02:02:12,560
it's been the same throughout yeah and
 

7117
02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:13,990
it's been the same throughout yeah and
that's a that's a pretty

7118
02:02:13,990 --> 02:02:14,000
that's a that's a pretty
 

7119
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,470
that's a that's a pretty
you know dismissive thing to say right

7120
02:02:16,470 --> 02:02:16,480
you know dismissive thing to say right
 

7121
02:02:16,480 --> 02:02:18,310
you know dismissive thing to say right
that i can reduce you to a

7122
02:02:18,310 --> 02:02:18,320
that i can reduce you to a
 

7123
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:22,229
that i can reduce you to a
an algorithm of you know with 11 uh

7124
02:02:22,229 --> 02:02:22,239
an algorithm of you know with 11 uh
 

7125
02:02:22,239 --> 02:02:25,510
an algorithm of you know with 11 uh
right yeah permutations um

7126
02:02:25,510 --> 02:02:25,520
right yeah permutations um
 

7127
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:27,510
right yeah permutations um
but you know the thing to remember i

7128
02:02:27,510 --> 02:02:27,520
but you know the thing to remember i
 

7129
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:29,189
but you know the thing to remember i
guess is that

7130
02:02:29,189 --> 02:02:29,199
guess is that
 

7131
02:02:29,199 --> 02:02:30,790
guess is that
some of the best funded companies in the

7132
02:02:30,790 --> 02:02:30,800
some of the best funded companies in the
 

7133
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:33,109
some of the best funded companies in the
bitcoin space the most powerful miners

7134
02:02:33,109 --> 02:02:33,119
bitcoin space the most powerful miners
 

7135
02:02:33,119 --> 02:02:35,030
bitcoin space the most powerful miners
billionaires have tried to change and

7136
02:02:35,030 --> 02:02:35,040
billionaires have tried to change and
 

7137
02:02:35,040 --> 02:02:37,910
billionaires have tried to change and
co-opt and alter bitcoin

7138
02:02:37,910 --> 02:02:37,920
co-opt and alter bitcoin
 

7139
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:41,109
co-opt and alter bitcoin
um to shape it to their liking

7140
02:02:41,109 --> 02:02:41,119
um to shape it to their liking
 

7141
02:02:41,119 --> 02:02:43,270
um to shape it to their liking
and without these incredibly hardcore

7142
02:02:43,270 --> 02:02:43,280
and without these incredibly hardcore
 

7143
02:02:43,280 --> 02:02:44,950
and without these incredibly hardcore
sort of high priests of the bitcoin

7144
02:02:44,950 --> 02:02:44,960
sort of high priests of the bitcoin
 

7145
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:46,229
sort of high priests of the bitcoin
protocol

7146
02:02:46,229 --> 02:02:46,239
protocol
 

7147
02:02:46,239 --> 02:02:49,430
protocol
it would have been hopeless hopelessly

7148
02:02:49,430 --> 02:02:49,440
it would have been hopeless hopelessly
 

7149
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:51,750
it would have been hopeless hopelessly
malleated in all number of ways

7150
02:02:51,750 --> 02:02:51,760
malleated in all number of ways
 

7151
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:54,870
malleated in all number of ways
and so there is a reason

7152
02:02:54,870 --> 02:02:54,880
and so there is a reason
 

7153
02:02:54,880 --> 02:02:57,030
and so there is a reason
why someone would be incredibly

7154
02:02:57,030 --> 02:02:57,040
why someone would be incredibly
 

7155
02:02:57,040 --> 02:02:57,990
why someone would be incredibly
protective

7156
02:02:57,990 --> 02:02:58,000
protective
 

7157
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:01,350
protective
of bitcoin uh does that justify

7158
02:03:01,350 --> 02:03:01,360
of bitcoin uh does that justify
 

7159
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:03,669
of bitcoin uh does that justify
immense toxicity on you know on social

7160
02:03:03,669 --> 02:03:03,679
immense toxicity on you know on social
 

7161
02:03:03,679 --> 02:03:04,950
immense toxicity on you know on social
media

7162
02:03:04,950 --> 02:03:04,960
media
 

7163
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:08,709
media

i went on this journey where i

7438
02:07:58,629 --> 02:07:58,639
i went on this journey where i
 

7439
02:07:58,639 --> 02:08:00,550
i went on this journey where i
eventually realized that

7440
02:08:00,550 --> 02:08:00,560
eventually realized that
 

7441
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:01,910
eventually realized that
i don't know if i'm any better of a

7442

i don't know if i'm any better of a

writer for having realized it

7444
02:08:03,910 --> 02:08:03,920
writer for having realized it
 

7445
02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:05,830
writer for having realized it
but i think that is a necessary

7446
02:08:05,830 --> 02:08:05,840
but i think that is a necessary
 

7447
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:10,149
but i think that is a necessary
condition so does that mean

7448
02:08:10,149 --> 02:08:10,159
condition so does that mean
 

7449
02:08:10,159 --> 02:08:12,149
condition so does that mean
there is a value to striving for

7450
02:08:12,149 --> 02:08:12,159
there is a value to striving for
 

7451
02:08:12,159 --> 02:08:13,430
there is a value to striving for
simplicity in

7452
02:08:13,430 --> 02:08:13,440
simplicity in
 

7453
02:08:13,440 --> 02:08:17,030
simplicity in
in the words as opposed to

02:08:17,030 --> 02:08:17,040
in the words as opposed to
 

7455
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:21,189
in the words as opposed to
i mean complexity i think so for sure

7456
02:08:21,189 --> 02:08:21,199
i mean complexity i think so for sure
 

7457
02:08:21,199 --> 02:08:23,109
i mean complexity i think so for sure
and we deal with complex topics all the

7458
02:08:23,109 --> 02:08:23,119
and we deal with complex topics all the
 

7459
02:08:23,119 --> 02:08:24,629
and we deal with complex topics all the
time in crypto

7460
02:08:24,629 --> 02:08:24,639
time in crypto
 

7461
02:08:24,639 --> 02:08:26,790
time in crypto
and that's always a huge red flag for me

7462
02:08:26,790 --> 02:08:26,800
and that's always a huge red flag for me
 

7463
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:28,149
and that's always a huge red flag for me

something
complex if you can't find simple ways to

7472
02:08:36,310 --> 02:08:36,320
complex if you can't find simple ways to
 

7473
02:08:36,320 --> 02:08:37,430
complex if you can't find simple ways to
discuss it

7474
02:08:37,430 --> 02:08:37,440

they've been successful
 

8223
02:21:33,040 --> 02:21:35,190
they've been successful
right and so yeah they might say you

8224
02:21:35,190 --> 02:21:35,200
right and so yeah they might say you
 

8225
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:37,110
right and so yeah they might say you
know i was wearing a green tie

8226
02:21:37,110 --> 02:21:37,120
know i was wearing a green tie
 

8227
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:39,510
know i was wearing a green tie
on the day of my job interview and so

8228
02:21:39,510 --> 02:21:39,520
on the day of my job interview and so
 

8229
02:21:39,520 --> 02:21:41,349
on the day of my job interview and so
you should go out and wear green ties

8230
02:21:41,349 --> 02:21:41,359
you should go out and wear green ties
 

8231
02:21:41,359 --> 02:21:43,270
you should go out and wear green ties
and so they might just get the causality

8232
02:21:43,270 --> 02:21:43,280
and so they might just get the causality
 

8233
02:21:43,280 --> 02:21:44,630
and so they might just get the causality
completely wrong

8234
02:21:44,630 --> 02:21:44,640
completely wrong
 

8235
02:21:44,640 --> 02:21:47,349
completely wrong
right i mean i'm not gonna claim that

8236
02:21:47,349 --> 02:21:47,359
right i mean i'm not gonna claim that
 

8237
02:21:47,359 --> 02:21:47,910
right i mean i'm not gonna claim that
i'm

8238
02:21:47,910 --> 02:21:47,920
i'm
 

8239

i'm
super successfully at it but um

02:21:51,750 --> 02:21:51,760
super successfully at it but um
 

8241
02:21:51,760 --> 02:21:53,429
super successfully at it but um
see that's the problem is that i don't

8242
02:21:53,429 --> 02:21:53,439
see that's the problem is that i don't
 

8243
02:21:53,439 --> 02:21:55,030
