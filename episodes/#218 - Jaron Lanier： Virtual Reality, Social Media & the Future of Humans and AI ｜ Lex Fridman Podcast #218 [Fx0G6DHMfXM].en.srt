it's always um infinitely arbitrarily

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,629
it's always um infinitely arbitrarily

277
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,469

brings out a certain kind of nerdy

278
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
brings out a certain kind of nerdy
 

279
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,350
brings out a certain kind of nerdy
personality in people or at least in me

which um i'm not that fond of and there

00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:06,560
which um i'm not that fond of and there
 

283
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,749
which um i'm not that fond of and there
are all kinds of things about software i

284
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
are all kinds of things about software i
 

285
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,110
are all kinds of things about software i
don't like

286
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,120
don't like

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,510

295
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,749
just pointed out on the other hand you
know i'm a little mystified when people

know i'm a little mystified when people
 

297
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,909
know i'm a little mystified when people
ask me well do you think the universe is

a computer
 

301
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,390
a computer
and i have to say well i mean

00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
and i have to say well i mean
 

303
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,230
and i have to say well i mean
what on earth could you possibly mean if

what on earth could you possibly mean if

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,550
what on earth could you possibly mean if
you say it isn't a computer if it isn't

00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:28,560
you say it isn't a computer if it isn't

you say it isn't a computer if it isn't

else is a computer ultimately you know i
 

319
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,070
else is a computer ultimately you know i
mean and we have physics we have

i think trying to understand it as a

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,469
i think trying to understand it as a
turing machine is probably

turing machine is probably
 

333
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,790
turing machine is probably
a foolish approach

334
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
a foolish approach
 

335
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,510
a foolish approach
right that's the question whether

336
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520
right that's the question whether
 

337
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,230
right that's the question whether
it performs this computer we call the

338
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:58,240
it performs this computer we call the
 

339
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,510
it performs this computer we call the
universe performs the kind of

340
00:05:59,510 --> 00:05:59,520
universe performs the kind of
 

341
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,150
universe performs the kind of
computation that can be modeled as a

342
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,160
computation that can be modeled as a
 

343
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,309
computation that can be modeled as a
universal touring machine or is it

344
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:04,319
universal touring machine or is it
 

345
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,270
universal touring machine or is it
something much more fancy

346
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,280
something much more fancy
 

347
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,270
something much more fancy
so fancy in fact that we it may be

348
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,280
so fancy in fact that we it may be
 

349
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,950
so fancy in fact that we it may be
beyond our cognitive capabilities to

350
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:10,960
beyond our cognitive capabilities to
 

351
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,550
beyond our cognitive capabilities to

turing machines are kind of

00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800
turing machines are kind of
 

355
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,150
turing machines are kind of
um

356
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,160
um
 

357
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,550
um
i'd call them teases in a way

358
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
i'd call them teases in a way
 

359
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,670
i'd call them teases in a way
because like

because like
 

361
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,430
because like
if you have

then they're universal but yeah that

00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,560
then they're universal but yeah that
 

373
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,390
then they're universal but yeah that
cannot exist so they're not universal in

374
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:32,400
cannot exist so they're not universal in
 

375
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,110
cannot exist so they're not universal in
practice and they they actually are

377
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,430

you know the constraints within

you know the constraints within
 

383
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,350
you know the constraints within

reality that's
 

387
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,070
reality that's
worth being in probably and so

388
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
worth being in probably and so
 

389
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,150
worth being in probably and so
so i i

390
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,160
so i i
 

391
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,270
so i i
uh

392
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,280
uh
 

393
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,710
uh
i think

394
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:52,720
i think
 

395
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,589
i think
the universality of a particular model

396
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:55,599
the universality of a particular model
 

397
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,469
the universality of a particular model
is probably a deceptive way to think

398
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:58,479
is probably a deceptive way to think
 

399
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,870
is probably a deceptive way to think
even though at some sort of limit of

400
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:00,880
even though at some sort of limit of
 

401
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,510
even though at some sort of limit of
course it's can it

402
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,520
course it's can it
 

403
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,110
course it's can it
something like that's got to be true at

404
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,120
something like that's got to be true at
 

405
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,390
something like that's got to be true at
some sort of

406
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,400
some sort of
 

407
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,909
some sort of
high enough limit but it's just not

408
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:07,919
high enough limit but it's just not
 

409
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,309
high enough limit but it's just not
accessible to us so what's the point

410
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319
accessible to us so what's the point
 

411
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,309
accessible to us so what's the point
well to me the question of like whether

00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:12,319
well to me the question of like whether
 

413
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,230
well to me the question of like whether
we're living inside a computer or a

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,950
following way
there's a technical question is here

420
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:20,960
there's a technical question is here
 

421
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,150
there's a technical question is here
how difficult is it to build

422
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:24,160
how difficult is it to build
 

423
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,830
how difficult is it to build
a machine

424
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:25,840
a machine
 

425
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,230
a machine
not that simulates the universe

00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,240
not that simulates the universe
 

427
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,350
not that simulates the universe
but that makes it sufficiently realistic

00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
but that makes it sufficiently realistic
 

429
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,430
but that makes it sufficiently realistic
that we wouldn't know the difference or

430
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,440
that we wouldn't know the difference or

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,550
that we wouldn't know the difference or
better yet

sufficiently realistic that we would
kind of know the difference but we would

00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,240
kind of know the difference but we would

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,830

talk about the history of other media so
for instance there was a peer review

behind a curtain was indistinguishable
 

487
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,670
behind a curtain was indistinguishable
from a real opera singer and so now of

from a real opera singer and so now of
 

489
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,269
from a real opera singer and so now of
course to us it would not only be

490
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:33,279
course to us it would not only be
 

491
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,870
course to us it would not only be
distinguishable but it would be very

492

distinguishable but it would be very
 

493
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,550
distinguishable but it would be very
blatant because the the recording would

494
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:36,560
blatant because the the recording would
 

495
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,469
blatant because the the recording would
be horrible but to the people at the

496
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:38,479
be horrible but to the people at the
 

497
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,909
be horrible but to the people at the

499

seemed plausible
 

501
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,470
seemed plausible
there was an early demonstration of

502
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:46,480
there was an early demonstration of
 

503
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,509
there was an early demonstration of
extremely crude video teleconferencing

504
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:49,519
extremely crude video teleconferencing
 

505
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,590
extremely crude video teleconferencing
between new york and dc

506
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:51,600
between new york and dc
 

507
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,030
between new york and dc
in the 30s i think so that people viewed

508
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,040
in the 30s i think so that people viewed
 

509
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,389
in the 30s i think so that people viewed
as being absolutely realistic and

510
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:56,399
as being absolutely realistic and
 

511
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,310
as being absolutely realistic and
indistinguishable which to us would be

512
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,320
indistinguishable which to us would be
 

513
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,350
indistinguishable which to us would be
horrible

514
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,360
horrible
 

515
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,870
horrible
uh and there are many other examples

516
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:00,880
uh and there are many other examples
 

517
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,230
uh and there are many other examples
another one one of my favorite ones is

518
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,240
another one one of my favorite ones is
 

519
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,990
another one one of my favorite ones is
in the civil war era

520
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
in the civil war era
 

521
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,150
in the civil war era
there were itinerant photographers who

522
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,160
there were itinerant photographers who
 

523
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,070
there were itinerant photographers who
collected photographs of people who just

524
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,080
collected photographs of people who just
 

525
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,550
collected photographs of people who just
looked kind of like a few archetypes

526
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:10,560
looked kind of like a few archetypes
 

527
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,470
looked kind of like a few archetypes
so you could buy a photo of somebody who

528
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:12,480
so you could buy a photo of somebody who
 

529
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,350
so you could buy a photo of somebody who
looked kind of like your loved one

530
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
looked kind of like your loved one
 

531
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,269
looked kind of like your loved one
to remind you of that person because

532
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:17,279
to remind you of that person because
 

533
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,269
to remind you of that person because
actually photographing them was

534
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,279
actually photographing them was
 

535
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,509
actually photographing them was
inconceivable and hiring a painter was

536
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:21,519
inconceivable and hiring a painter was
 

537
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,949
inconceivable and hiring a painter was
too expensive and you didn't have any

538
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:22,959
too expensive and you didn't have any
 

539
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,470
too expensive and you didn't have any
way for the painter to represent them

540
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,480
way for the painter to represent them
 

541
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,990
way for the painter to represent them
remotely anyway how would they even know

542
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,000
remotely anyway how would they even know
 

543
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,590
remotely anyway how would they even know
what they looked like

544
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600
what they looked like
 

545
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,470
what they looked like
so these are all great examples of how

546
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:30,480
so these are all great examples of how
 

547
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,389
so these are all great examples of how
in the early days of different media we

548
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:32,399
in the early days of different media we
 

549
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,910
in the early days of different media we
perceived the media as being really

550
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:33,920
perceived the media as being really
 

551
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,150
perceived the media as being really
great but then we evolved through the

552
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,160
great but then we evolved through the
 

553
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,150
great but then we evolved through the
experience of the media this gets back

554
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,160
experience of the media this gets back
 

555
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,509
experience of the media this gets back
to what i was saying maybe the greatest

556
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:39,519
to what i was saying maybe the greatest
 

557
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,430
to what i was saying maybe the greatest
gift of photography is that we can see

558
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:41,440
gift of photography is that we can see
 

559
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,030
gift of photography is that we can see
the flaws in a photograph and appreciate

560
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,040
the flaws in a photograph and appreciate
 

561
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,389
the flaws in a photograph and appreciate
reality more

562
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:44,399
reality more
 

563
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,150
reality more
maybe the greatest gift of audio

564
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
maybe the greatest gift of audio
 

565
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,670
maybe the greatest gift of audio
recording is that we can distinguish

566
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:47,680
recording is that we can distinguish
 

567
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,990
recording is that we can distinguish
that opera thing on our singer now from

568
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
that opera thing on our singer now from
 

569
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,990
that opera thing on our singer now from
that recording of the opera singer on

570
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,000
that recording of the opera singer on
 

571
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,110
that recording of the opera singer on
the horrible wire recorder so so we're

572
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,120
the horrible wire recorder so so we're
 

573
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,389
the horrible wire recorder so so we're
we we shouldn't limit ourselves by some

574
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:58,399
we we shouldn't limit ourselves by some
 

575
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,190
we we shouldn't limit ourselves by some
assumption of stasis that's incorrect

576
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,200
assumption of stasis that's incorrect
 

577
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,030
assumption of stasis that's incorrect
so that's the first thing that's my

578
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,040
so that's the first thing that's my
 

579
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,470
so that's the first thing that's my
first answer which is i think the most

580
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:04,480
first answer which is i think the most
 

581
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,470
first answer which is i think the most
important one now of course somebody

582
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,480
important one now of course somebody
 

583
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,910
important one now of course somebody
might come back and say oh but you know

584
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:07,920
might come back and say oh but you know
 

585
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,829
might come back and say oh but you know
technology can go so far there must be

586
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:09,839
technology can go so far there must be
 

587
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,590
technology can go so far there must be
some point at which would surpass that's

588
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:11,600
some point at which would surpass that's
 

589
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,430
some point at which would surpass that's
a different question i i think that's

590
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440
a different question i i think that's
 

591
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,870
a different question i i think that's
also an interesting question but i think

592
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:14,880
also an interesting question but i think
 

593
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,310
also an interesting question but i think
the answer i just gave you is actually

594
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,320
the answer i just gave you is actually
 

595
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,829
the answer i just gave you is actually
the more important answer to the more

596
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:17,839
the more important answer to the more
 

597
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,150
the more important answer to the more
important question that's profound yeah

598
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
important question that's profound yeah
 

599
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,750
important question that's profound yeah
but can you can you

600
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,760
but can you can you
 

601
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,829
but can you can you
the second question which you're now

602
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:23,839
the second question which you're now
 

603
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,630
the second question which you're now
making me realize is way different

604
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:26,640
making me realize is way different
 

605
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,030
making me realize is way different
is it possible to create worlds in which

606
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,040
is it possible to create worlds in which
 

607
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,430
is it possible to create worlds in which
people would want to stay

608
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:31,440
people would want to stay
 

609
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,750
people would want to stay
instead of the real world well

610
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:33,760
instead of the real world well
 

611
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,790
instead of the real world well
like um i unmask like large numbers of

612
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:36,800
like um i unmask like large numbers of
 

613

know as i said before i hope that the
 

617
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,550
know as i said before i hope that the
experience of virtual worlds helps

618
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560
experience of virtual worlds helps
 

619
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,870
experience of virtual worlds helps
people appreciate

620
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880
people appreciate
 

621
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,430
people appreciate
this this physical world we have and

622
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:49,440
this this physical world we have and
 

623
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,550
this this physical world we have and
feel

624
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:50,560
feel
 

625
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,110
feel
tender towards it and and uh

626
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,120
tender towards it and and uh
 

627
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,389
tender towards it and and uh
keep it from getting too [\h__\h] up

628
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
keep it from getting too [\h__\h] up
 

629
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,230
keep it from getting too [\h__\h] up
that's my hope

630
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,240
that's my hope
 

631
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,550
that's my hope
um do you see all technology in that way

632
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:58,560
um do you see all technology in that way
 

633
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,389
um do you see all technology in that way
so basically technology

634
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:00,399
so basically technology
 

635
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,630
so basically technology
helps us appreciate

636
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:02,640
helps us appreciate
 

637
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,069
helps us appreciate
the more sort of

638
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:04,079
the more sort of
 

639
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,150
the more sort of
technology-free aspect of life

640
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,160

 

641
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,030

well

642
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,040
well
 

643
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,550
well
media technology

644
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,560
media technology
 

645
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,269
media technology
you know i mean i i you can stretch that

646
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
you know i mean i i you can stretch that
 

647
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,470
you know i mean i i you can stretch that
i mean you can

648
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:14,480
i mean you can
 

649
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,550
i mean you can
let me say i could definitely play

650
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:16,560
let me say i could definitely play
 

651
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,389
let me say i could definitely play
mcluhan and turn this into a general

652
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:18,399
mcluhan and turn this into a general
 

653
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,389
mcluhan and turn this into a general
theory it's totally doable the program

654
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:20,399
theory it's totally doable the program
 

655
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,630
theory it's totally doable the program
you just described is totally doable

656
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:22,640
you just described is totally doable
 

657
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,870
you just described is totally doable
um in fact i will psychically predict

658
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:24,880
um in fact i will psychically predict
 

659
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,150
um in fact i will psychically predict
that if you did the research you could

660
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
that if you did the research you could
 

661
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,790
that if you did the research you could
find 20 phd theses that do that already

662
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:28,800
find 20 phd theses that do that already
 

663

find 20 phd theses that do that already
yeah i don't i don't know but they might

exist but
 

667
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,710
exist but
i i don't know how much value there is

00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,000
of uh the different fascinations with
 

729
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,389
of uh the different fascinations with
whether we're in a simulation or not or

whether we're in a simulation or not or
 

731
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,910
whether we're in a simulation or not or
you know that there's a whole world of

you know that there's a whole world of
 

733
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,310
you know that there's a whole world of
variations on that um

00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:40,320
variations on that um
 

735
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,750
variations on that um
i wish they'd step back and think about

736
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:41,760
i wish they'd step back and think about
 

737
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,990
i wish they'd step back and think about
their own motivations and exactly what

738
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,000
their own motivations and exactly what
 

739
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,870
their own motivations and exactly what
they mean you know what and and i think

740
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:46,880
they mean you know what and and i think
 

741
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,269
they mean you know what and and i think
the danger with these things

742
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:49,279
the danger with these things
 

743
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,350
the danger with these things
is

744
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,360
is
 

745
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,790
is
um

746
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:52,800
um
 

747
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,710
um
so if you say is the universe some kind

748
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:54,720
so if you say is the universe some kind
 

749
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,110
so if you say is the universe some kind
of computer broadly it has to be because

00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,030
of computer broadly it has to be because
it's not coherent to say that the uh

752
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,040
it's not coherent to say that the uh
 

753
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,350
it's not coherent to say that the uh
that it isn't on the other hand to say

00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:01,360
that it isn't on the other hand to say
 

755
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,110
that it isn't on the other hand to say
that that means you know anything about

756
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,120
that that means you know anything about
 

757
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,030
that that means you know anything about
what kind of computer

758
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,040
what kind of computer
 

759
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,470
what kind of computer
that's something very different and the

760
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:06,480
that's something very different and the
 

761
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,910
that's something very different and the

anything where you might use

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,389
anything where you might use
computational metaphors like we have to

768
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:12,399
computational metaphors like we have to
 

769
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,310
computational metaphors like we have to
have a bit of modesty about where we

770
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,320
have a bit of modesty about where we
 

771
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,590
have a bit of modesty about where we
stand and the problem i have with these

00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:17,600
stand and the problem i have with these
 

773
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,590

this sort of hardcore uh
computationalist idea about uh the brain

1166

computationalist idea about uh the brain
 

1167
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,789
computationalist idea about uh the brain
has turned into medieval christianity

1168
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:28,799
has turned into medieval christianity
 

1169

this is so the ernest becker's idea that

1186
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:45,760
this is so the ernest becker's idea that
 

1187
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,630
this is so the ernest becker's idea that
death

1188
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:46,640
death
 

1189
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,230
death
the fear of death is the warm at the

1190
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:48,240
the fear of death is the warm at the
 

1191
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,430
the fear of death is the warm at the
core

1192
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:49,440
core
 

1193
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,950
core
which is like

1194
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:50,960
which is like
 

1195
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,830
which is like
that's the that's the core motivator of

1196
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:53,840
that's the that's the core motivator of
 

1197
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,950
that's the that's the core motivator of
everything we see humans have created

1198
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:56,960
everything we see humans have created
 

1199
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,470
everything we see humans have created
the question is if that fear of

1200
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:58,480
the question is if that fear of
 

1201
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,029
the question is if that fear of
mortality is somehow core it's like a

1202
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:01,039
mortality is somehow core it's like a
 

1203
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,190
mortality is somehow core it's like a
prerequisite

1204
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:03,200
prerequisite
 

1205
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,070
prerequisite
so

1206
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080

it's hard to summarize this because it's
 

1329
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,070
it's hard to summarize this because it's
decades of stuff

1330
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:16,080
decades of stuff
 

1331
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,990
decades of stuff
the first thing to say

1332
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,000

the first thing to say
is that nobody can claim absolute

1334
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,080
is that nobody can claim absolute
 

1335

knowledge about whether

1336
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:22,480
knowledge about whether
 

1337
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,230
knowledge about whether
somebody or something else is conscious

1338
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:24,240
somebody or something else is conscious
 

1339
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,909
somebody or something else is conscious
or not

1340
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:25,919
or not
 

1341
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,990
or not
this is all a matter of faith and in

1342
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,000
this is all a matter of faith and in
 

1343
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,870
this is all a matter of faith and in
fact

1344
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:28,880
fact
 

1345
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,669
fact
um

1346
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:29,679
um
 

1347
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,070
um
i think the whole idea of faith needs to

1348
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,080
i think the whole idea of faith needs to
 

1349
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,070
i think the whole idea of faith needs to
be updated so it's not about god but

1350
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,080
be updated so it's not about god but
 

1351
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,789
be updated so it's not about god but
it's just about stuff in the universe we

1352
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:36,799
it's just about stuff in the universe we
 

1353
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,310
it's just about stuff in the universe we
we have faith in each other being

1354
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:38,320
we have faith in each other being
 

1355
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,029
we have faith in each other being
conscious and then um

1356
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:41,039
conscious and then um
 

1357
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,549
conscious and then um
i used to frame this as a thing called

1358
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:42,559
i used to frame this as a thing called
 

1359
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,230
i used to frame this as a thing called
the circle of empathy

1360
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:44,240
the circle of empathy
 

1361
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,990
the circle of empathy
in my old papers and then

1362
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,000
in my old papers and then
 

1363
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,950
in my old papers and then
um

1364
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:46,960
um
 

1365
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,310
um
it turned into a thing for the animal

1366
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:48,320
it turned into a thing for the animal
 

1367
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,590
it turned into a thing for the animal
rights movement so i noticed peter

1368
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:49,600
rights movement so i noticed peter
 

1369
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,110
rights movement so i noticed peter
singer using it i don't know if it was

1370
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,120
singer using it i don't know if it was
 

1371
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,990
singer using it i don't know if it was
coincident or but anyway we there's this

1372
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,000
coincident or but anyway we there's this
 

1373
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,590
coincident or but anyway we there's this
idea that you draw a circle around

1374
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:55,600
idea that you draw a circle around
 

1375
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,590
idea that you draw a circle around
yourself and the stuff inside is more

1376
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:57,600
yourself and the stuff inside is more
 

1377
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,350
yourself and the stuff inside is more
like you might be conscious might be

1378
00:23:59,350 --> 00:23:59,360
like you might be conscious might be
 

1379
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,789
like you might be conscious might be
deserving of your empathy of your

1380
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:00,799
deserving of your empathy of your
 

1381
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,029
deserving of your empathy of your
consideration and the stuff outside the

1382
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:03,039
consideration and the stuff outside the
 

1383
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,590
consideration and the stuff outside the
circle isn't and

1384
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:05,600
circle isn't and
 

1385
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,310
circle isn't and
um outside the circle might be a rock

1386
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:08,320
um outside the circle might be a rock
 

1387
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,310
um outside the circle might be a rock
or

1388
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,320
or
 

1389
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,350
or
i don't know uh so uh and that circle is

1390
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:13,360
i don't know uh so uh and that circle is
 

1391
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,430
i don't know uh so uh and that circle is
fundamentally based on faith

1392
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:15,440
fundamentally based on faith
 

1393
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,190
fundamentally based on faith
well your faith and what is and what

1394
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:17,200
well your faith and what is and what
 

1395
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,909
well your faith and what is and what
isn't the thing about this circle

1396
00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:19,919
isn't the thing about this circle
 

1397
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,149
isn't the thing about this circle
is it can't be pure faith it also has

1398
00:24:22,149 --> 00:24:22,159
is it can't be pure faith it also has
 

1399
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,909
is it can't be pure faith it also has
it's also a pragmatic decision and this

1400
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:23,919
it's also a pragmatic decision and this
 

1401
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,830
it's also a pragmatic decision and this
is where things get complicated

1402
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:25,840
is where things get complicated
 

1403
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,230
is where things get complicated
if you try to make it too big you suffer

1404
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:28,240
if you try to make it too big you suffer
 

1405
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,750
if you try to make it too big you suffer
from incompetence

1406
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:29,760
from incompetence
 

1407
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,870
from incompetence
if you say

1408
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:30,880
if you say
 

1409
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,430
if you say
i don't want to kill a bacteria i will

1410
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:33,440

what do you do yeah like you know like

1414
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:37,039
what do you do yeah like you know like
 

1415
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,950
what do you do yeah like you know like
there's a there's a competence question

1416
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:38,960
there's a there's a competence question
 

1417
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,870
there's a there's a competence question
where you do have to draw the line

1418
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:40,880
where you do have to draw the line
 

1419
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,870
where you do have to draw the line
people who make it too small become

1420
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:42,880
people who make it too small become
 

1421
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,230
people who make it too small become
cruel

1422
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:44,240
cruel
 

1423
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,230
cruel
people are so clanished and political

1424
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:46,240
people are so clanished and political
 

1425
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,390
people are so clanished and political
and so worried about themselves ending

1426
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:48,400
and so worried about themselves ending
 

1427
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,149
and so worried about themselves ending
up on the bottom

1428
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:50,159
up on the bottom
 

1429
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,390
up on the bottom
of society that they are always ready to

1430
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:52,400
of society that they are always ready to
 

1431
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,310
of society that they are always ready to
gang up on some designated group and so

1432
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:54,320
gang up on some designated group and so
 

1433
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,269
gang up on some designated group and so
there's always these people who are

1434
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:55,279
there's always these people who are
 

1435
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,029
there's always these people who are
being tried we're always trying to shove

1436
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:57,039
being tried we're always trying to shove
 

1437
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,710
being tried we're always trying to shove
somebody out of the circle

1438
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:58,720
somebody out of the circle
 

1439
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,029
somebody out of the circle
and so aren't you shoving ai outside the

1440
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:01,039
and so aren't you shoving ai outside the
 

1441
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,630
and so aren't you shoving ai outside the
circle well give me a second all right

1442
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:02,640
circle well give me a second all right
 

1443
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,269
circle well give me a second all right
so so there's a pragmatic consideration

1444
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:05,279
so so there's a pragmatic consideration
 

1445
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,070
so so there's a pragmatic consideration
here yeah and so uh and and uh the the

1446
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:08,080
here yeah and so uh and and uh the the
 

1447
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,390
here yeah and so uh and and uh the the
biggest questions are probably fetuses

1448
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:10,400
biggest questions are probably fetuses
 

1449
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,470
biggest questions are probably fetuses
and animals lately but ai is getting

1450
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:12,480
and animals lately but ai is getting
 

1451
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,269
and animals lately but ai is getting
there

1452
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:13,279
there
 

1453
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,149
there
now with ai

1454
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:16,159
now with ai
 

1455
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,110
now with ai
i think

1456
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,120
i think
 

1457
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,029
i think
uh

1458
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:19,039
uh
 

1459
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,029
uh
and i've had this discussion so many

1460
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:21,039
and i've had this discussion so many
 

1461
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,710
and i've had this discussion so many
times people say but aren't you afraid

1462
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:22,720
times people say but aren't you afraid
 

1463
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,710
times people say but aren't you afraid
if you exclude ai you'd be cruel to some

1464
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:24,720
if you exclude ai you'd be cruel to some
 

1465
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,230
if you exclude ai you'd be cruel to some
consciousness

1466
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:26,240
consciousness
 

1467
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,390
consciousness
and then i would say well if you include

1468
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:28,400
and then i would say well if you include
 

1469
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,430
and then i would say well if you include
ai

1470
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:29,440
ai
 

1471
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,110
ai
you make yourself

1472
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:31,120
you make yourself
 

1473
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,269
you make yourself

00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:25,990
it allows them to
semi-consciously perform to each other

1646

invisible hand with this idea that we
 

1671
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,549
invisible hand with this idea that we
build this algorithmic thing and it gets

1672
00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:50,559
build this algorithmic thing and it gets
 

1673
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,310
build this algorithmic thing and it gets
a bit beyond us and then we think it

1674
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:52,320
a bit beyond us and then we think it
 

1675
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,310
a bit beyond us and then we think it
must be smarter than us and the thing

1676
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:54,320
must be smarter than us and the thing
 

1677
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,029
must be smarter than us and the thing
about the invisible hand is absolutely

manipulate you within social networks

1812

manipulate you within social networks
 

1813
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,110
manipulate you within social networks
and that's the biggest the biggest

and that's the biggest the biggest
 

1815
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,070
and that's the biggest the biggest
problem isn't necessarily that

um
 

1819
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,710
um
there's advertisement that uh

1820
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:26,720
there's advertisement that uh
 

1821
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,230
there's advertisement that uh
you know social networks present you

1822
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:28,240
you know social networks present you
 

1823
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,990
you know social networks present you
with advertisements that then get you to

1824
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:30,000
with advertisements that then get you to
 

1825
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,149
with advertisements that then get you to
buy stuff that's not the biggest problem

1826
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:32,159
buy stuff that's not the biggest problem
 

1827
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,590
buy stuff that's not the biggest problem
the biggest problem is they then

1828
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:33,600
the biggest problem is they then
 

1829
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,669
the biggest problem is they then
manipulate you

1830
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:35,679
manipulate you
 

1831
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,549
manipulate you
your they alter like your

1832
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:38,559
your they alter like your
 

1833
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,669
your they alter like your
human nature to get you to buy stuff or

1834
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:41,679
human nature to get you to buy stuff or
 

1835
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,669
human nature to get you to buy stuff or
or to get you to um

1836
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:43,679
or to get you to um
 

1837
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,630
or to get you to um
do whatever the advertiser wants or

1838
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:46,640
do whatever the advertiser wants or
 

1839
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,710
do whatever the advertiser wants or
maybe you can correct yeah i i don't see

1840
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:48,720
maybe you can correct yeah i i don't see
 

1841
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,710
maybe you can correct yeah i i don't see
it quite that way but we can work with

1842
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:50,720
it quite that way but we can work with
 

1843
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,110
it quite that way but we can work with
that as an approximation sure so my i

1844
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:53,120
that as an approximation sure so my i
 

1845
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,870
that as an approximation sure so my i
think the actual thing is even sort of

1846
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:54,880
think the actual thing is even sort of
 

1847
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,549
think the actual thing is even sort of
more ridiculous and stupider than that

1848
00:31:56,549 --> 00:31:56,559
more ridiculous and stupider than that
 

1849
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,029
more ridiculous and stupider than that
but that's that's okay let's let's so my

1850
00:31:59,029 --> 00:31:59,039
but that's that's okay let's let's so my
 

1851
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,070
but that's that's okay let's let's so my
question is let's not use the word ai

1852
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:02,080
question is let's not use the word ai
 

1853
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,029
question is let's not use the word ai
uh but

1854
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:03,039
uh but
 

1855
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,149
uh but
how do we

1856
00:32:04,149 --> 00:32:04,159
how do we
 

1857
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,830
how do we
fix it oh fixing social media um

1858
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:07,840
fix it oh fixing social media um
 

1859
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,990
fix it oh fixing social media um
that diverts us into this whole other

1860
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:10,000
that diverts us into this whole other
 

1861
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,389
that diverts us into this whole other
field in my view which is economics

1862
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:12,399
field in my view which is economics
 

1863
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:13,990
field in my view which is economics
which i always thought was really boring

1864
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:14,000
which i always thought was really boring
 

1865
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,669
which i always thought was really boring
but we have no choice but to turn into

1866
00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:15,679
but we have no choice but to turn into
 

1867
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,110
but we have no choice but to turn into
economists if we want to fix this

1868
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:17,120
economists if we want to fix this
 

1869
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,710
economists if we want to fix this
problem because it's all about

1870
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:18,720
problem because it's all about
 

1871
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,870
problem because it's all about
incentives but um

1872
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:20,880
incentives but um
 

1873
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,509
incentives but um
i've been around this thing since it

1874
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:23,519
i've been around this thing since it
 

1875
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,549
i've been around this thing since it
started and and uh i've been in the

1876
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:26,559
started and and uh i've been in the
 

1877
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,070
started and and uh i've been in the
meetings where the social media

1878
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:28,080
meetings where the social media
 

1879
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,310
meetings where the social media
companies

1880
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:30,320
companies
 

1881
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,149
companies
sell themselves to the people who put

1882
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:32,159
sell themselves to the people who put
 

1883
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,070
sell themselves to the people who put
the most money into them which are

1884
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,080
the most money into them which are
 

1885
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,669
the most money into them which are
usually the big advertising holding

1886
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:35,679
usually the big advertising holding
 

1887
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,149
usually the big advertising holding
companies and whatnot and there's this

1888
00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:38,159
companies and whatnot and there's this
 

1889
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,909
companies and whatnot and there's this
there's this idea that i think is kind

1890
00:32:39,909 --> 00:32:39,919
there's this idea that i think is kind
 

1891
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,269
there's this idea that i think is kind
of a fiction

1892
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:41,279
of a fiction
 

1893
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,029
of a fiction
and maybe it's even

1894
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:43,039
and maybe it's even
 

1895
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,029
and maybe it's even
been recognized as that by everybody

1896
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:45,039
been recognized as that by everybody
 

1897
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:45,750
been recognized as that by everybody
that

1898
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:45,760
that
 

1899
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,149
that
the the algorithm will get really good

1900
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:48,159
the the algorithm will get really good
 

1901
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,509
the the algorithm will get really good
at getting people to buy something

1902
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:49,519
at getting people to buy something
 

1903
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,269
at getting people to buy something
because i think people have looked at

1904
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:51,279
because i think people have looked at
 

1905
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,029
because i think people have looked at
their returns and looked at what happens

1906
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:53,039
their returns and looked at what happens
 

1907
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,870
their returns and looked at what happens
and everybody recognizes that's not

1908
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:54,880
and everybody recognizes that's not
 

1909
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,710
and everybody recognizes that's not
exactly right it's more

1910
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:58,720
exactly right it's more
 

1911
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,950
exactly right it's more
like a cognitive access

1912
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:00,960
like a cognitive access

anti-advertising i actually think
advertising can be demeaning and

1958
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:57,360
advertising can be demeaning and
 

1959
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,509
advertising can be demeaning and
annoying and banal

annoying and banal
 

1961
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,269
annoying and banal
and ridiculous

1962
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:01,279
and ridiculous
 

1963
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,269
and ridiculous
and take up a lot of our time with

1964
00:34:03,269 --> 00:34:03,279
and take up a lot of our time with
 

1965
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,029
and take up a lot of our time with
stupid stuff like there's a lot of ways

1966
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:05,039
stupid stuff like there's a lot of ways
 

1967
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,310
stupid stuff like there's a lot of ways
to criticize that um advertising that's

1968
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:08,320
to criticize that um advertising that's
 

1969
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,470
to criticize that um advertising that's
accurate and it can also lie and all

1970
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:10,480
accurate and it can also lie and all
 

1971
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,550
accurate and it can also lie and all
kinds of things however

1972
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:12,560
kinds of things however
 

1973
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,149
kinds of things however
if i look at the biggest picture i think

1974
00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:14,159
if i look at the biggest picture i think
 

1975
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,430
if i look at the biggest picture i think
advertising

1976
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:15,440
advertising
 

1977
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,270
advertising
at least as it was understood before

1978
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:17,280
at least as it was understood before
 

1979
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,550
at least as it was understood before
social media

1980
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:18,560
social media
 

1981
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,310
social media
helped bring people into modernity in a

1982
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:20,320
helped bring people into modernity in a
 

1983
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,829
helped bring people into modernity in a
way that overall

1984
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:21,839
way that overall
 

1985
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,550
way that overall
actually did benefit people overall

1986
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:24,560
actually did benefit people overall
 

1987
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,510
actually did benefit people overall
and

1988
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:25,520
and
 

1989
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,430
and
you might say am i contradicting myself

1990
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:27,440
you might say am i contradicting myself
 

1991
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,149
you might say am i contradicting myself
because i was saying you should

1992
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:28,159
because i was saying you should
 

1993
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,069
because i was saying you should
manipulate people yeah i am probably

1994
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:30,079
manipulate people yeah i am probably
 

1995
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,589
manipulate people yeah i am probably
here i mean i'm not i'm not pretending

1996
00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:31,599
here i mean i'm not i'm not pretending
 

1997
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,669
here i mean i'm not i'm not pretending
to have this perfect airtight

1998
00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:33,679
to have this perfect airtight
 

1999
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,430
to have this perfect airtight
world view without some contradictions i

2000
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:35,440
world view without some contradictions i
 

2001
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,710
world view without some contradictions i
think there's a bit of a contradiction

2002
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:36,720
think there's a bit of a contradiction
 

2003
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,389
think there's a bit of a contradiction
there so you know well looking at the

2004
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:38,399
there so you know well looking at the
 

2005
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,109
there so you know well looking at the
long arc of history advertisement has as

2006
00:34:41,109 --> 00:34:41,119
long arc of history advertisement has as
 

2007
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,750
long arc of history advertisement has as
in some parts benefited society yeah

2008
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:43,760
in some parts benefited society yeah
 

2009
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,990
in some parts benefited society yeah
because it funded some efforts that

2010
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:46,000
because it funded some efforts that
 

2011
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,710
because it funded some efforts that
perhaps yeah i mean i think like there's

2012
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:48,720
perhaps yeah i mean i think like there's
 

2013
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,710
perhaps yeah i mean i think like there's
a there's a thing where

2014
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:50,720
a there's a thing where
 

2015
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,550
a there's a thing where
uh sometimes i think it's actually been

2016
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:52,560
uh sometimes i think it's actually been
 

2017
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,829
uh sometimes i think it's actually been
of some use

2018
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:53,839
of some use
 

2019
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:54,710
of some use
now

2020
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:54,720
now
 

2021
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,470
now
let's

2022
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:56,480
let's
 

2023
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,069
let's
where the damage comes is a different

2024
00:34:58,069 --> 00:34:58,079
where the damage comes is a different
 

2025
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,829
where the damage comes is a different
thing though social media

2026
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:00,839
thing though social media
 

2027
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,430
thing though social media
um algorithms on social media have to

2028
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:03,440
um algorithms on social media have to
 

2029
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,349
um algorithms on social media have to
work on feedback loops where they

2030
00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:05,359
work on feedback loops where they
 

2031
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,030
work on feedback loops where they
present you with stimulus they have to

2032
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:07,040
present you with stimulus they have to
 

2033
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,950
present you with stimulus they have to
see if you respond to the stimulus

2034
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:08,960
see if you respond to the stimulus
 

2035
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,349
see if you respond to the stimulus
now the the problem is that the the

2036
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:11,359
now the the problem is that the the
 

2037
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,109
now the the problem is that the the
measurement mechanism for telling if you

2038
00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:13,119
measurement mechanism for telling if you
 

2039
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,510
measurement mechanism for telling if you
respond in the engagement

2040
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:15,520
respond in the engagement
 

2041
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,670
respond in the engagement
feedback loop is very very crude it's

2042
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:17,680
feedback loop is very very crude it's
 

2043
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,589
feedback loop is very very crude it's
things like whether you click more or

2044
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:19,599
things like whether you click more or
 

2045
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:20,950
things like whether you click more or
occasionally if you're staring at the

2046
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:20,960
occasionally if you're staring at the
 

2047
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,790
occasionally if you're staring at the
screen more if there's a forward-facing

2048
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:22,800
screen more if there's a forward-facing
 

2049
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,310
screen more if there's a forward-facing
camera that's activated but typically

2050
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:24,320
camera that's activated but typically
 

2051
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,349
camera that's activated but typically
there isn't

2052
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:25,359
there isn't
 

2053
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,190
there isn't
so you have this incredibly crude back

2054
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,200
so you have this incredibly crude back
 

2055
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,870
so you have this incredibly crude back
channel of information

2056
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:28,880
channel of information
 

2057
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,270
channel of information
and so it's crude enough that it only

2058
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:31,280
and so it's crude enough that it only
 

2059
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,470
and so it's crude enough that it only
catches

2060
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:32,480
catches
 

2061
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,430

actually a bit i don't make it easy and
 

2175
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,310
actually a bit i don't make it easy and
even with that i get this huge flood of

2176
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:28,320
even with that i get this huge flood of
 

2177
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,910
even with that i get this huge flood of
mail from people who say oh i quit my

2178
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:29,920

2181
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,109
social media i'm doing so much better i
can't believe how bad it was

2182
00:37:33,109 --> 00:37:33,119
can't believe how bad it was
 

2183
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,190
can't believe how bad it was
but the thing is what's for me a huge

2184
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:35,200
but the thing is what's for me a huge
 

2185
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,270
but the thing is what's for me a huge
flood of mail would be an imperceptible

2186
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:37,280
flood of mail would be an imperceptible
 

2187
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,190

right and so uh i think it's rare for

2190
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:43,040
right and so uh i think it's rare for
 

2191
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,710
right and so uh i think it's rare for
somebody to look at themselves and say

2192
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:44,720
somebody to look at themselves and say
 

2193
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,270
somebody to look at themselves and say
oh boy i sure screwed myself over

2194
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:47,280
oh boy i sure screwed myself over
 

2195
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,190
oh boy i sure screwed myself over
well it's a really hard thing to ask of

2196
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:49,200
well it's a really hard thing to ask of
 

2197
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,190
well it's a really hard thing to ask of
somebody none of us find that easy right

2198
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:51,200
somebody none of us find that easy right
 

2199
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,030
somebody none of us find that easy right
well the reason that's hard the reason i

2200
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,040
well the reason that's hard the reason i
 

2201
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,349
well the reason that's hard the reason i
ask this is is it possible to design

2202
00:37:55,349 --> 00:37:55,359
ask this is is it possible to design
 

2203
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,270
ask this is is it possible to design

think what you should do is design a

2216
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:09,760
think what you should do is design a
 

2217
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,150
think what you should do is design a
system that's just respectful of the

00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:12,160
system that's just respectful of the
 

2219
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,910
system that's just respectful of the
people and subordinates itself to the

people and subordinates itself to the
 

2221
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,829
people and subordinates itself to the
people and doesn't have perverse

people and doesn't have perverse
 

2223
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,750
people and doesn't have perverse
incentives and then at least there's a

2224
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:17,760
incentives and then at least there's a
 

2225
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,829
incentives and then at least there's a
chance of something decent happening you

2226
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:19,839
chance of something decent happening you
 

2227

thing sometime and do it but then i
 

2387
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,510

think the problem with that is youtube

social
 

2431
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,030
social
maybe not things that are officially

2432
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:51,040
maybe not things that are officially
 

2433
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,950
maybe not things that are officially
social media but things where people are

2434
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:52,960
social media but things where people are
 

2435
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,109
social media but things where people are
together online and see which ones have

2436
00:41:55,109 --> 00:41:55,119
together online and see which ones have
 

2437
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,349
together online and see which ones have
more healthy conversations even if it's

2438
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:57,359
more healthy conversations even if it's
 

2439
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,349
more healthy conversations even if it's
hard to

2440
00:41:59,349 --> 00:41:59,359
hard to
 

2441
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:00,630
hard to
be completely objective in that

2442
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:00,640
be completely objective in that
 

2443
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,470
be completely objective in that
measurement you can kind of at least

2444
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:02,480
measurement you can kind of at least
 

2445
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,230
measurement you can kind of at least
cruelly you could do subjective

2446
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:04,240
cruelly you could do subjective
 

2447
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,790
cruelly you could do subjective
annotation of this like having so here

2448
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:06,800
annotation of this like having so here
 

2449
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,030
annotation of this like having so here
crowdsourced yeah one that i've been

2450
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:09,040
crowdsourced yeah one that i've been
 

2451
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,430
crowdsourced yeah one that i've been
really interested in is github

2452
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:11,440
really interested in is github
 

2453
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,589
really interested in is github
because um

2454
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:13,599
because um
 

2455
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,430
because um
uh it could change i'm not saying it'll

2456
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:15,440
uh it could change i'm not saying it'll
 

2457
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,230
uh it could change i'm not saying it'll
always be but for the most part github

2458
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:18,240
always be but for the most part github
 

2459
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,109
always be but for the most part github
has had a relatively quite low poison

2460
00:42:21,109 --> 00:42:21,119
has had a relatively quite low poison
 

2461
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,150
has had a relatively quite low poison
quotient

2462
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:22,160
quotient
 

2463
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,030
quotient
and

2464
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:23,040
and
 

2465
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,630
and
i think there's a few things about

2466
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:24,640
i think there's a few things about
 

2467
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,550
i think there's a few things about
github that are interesting

2468
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:26,560
github that are interesting
 

2469
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,710
github that are interesting
one thing about it is that people have a

2470
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:28,720
one thing about it is that people have a
 

2471
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,270
one thing about it is that people have a
stake in it it's not just empty status

2472
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:31,280
stake in it it's not just empty status
 

2473
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,109
stake in it it's not just empty status
games there's actual code or there's

2474
00:42:33,109 --> 00:42:33,119
games there's actual code or there's
 

2475
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,589
games there's actual code or there's
actual stuff being done and i think as

2476
00:42:35,589 --> 00:42:35,599
actual stuff being done and i think as
 

2477
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,510
actual stuff being done and i think as
soon as you have a real world stake in

2478
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:37,520
soon as you have a real world stake in
 

2479
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,030
soon as you have a real world stake in
something

2480
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:39,040
something
 

2481
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,910
something
you have a motivation to not screw up

2482
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:41,920
you have a motivation to not screw up
 

2483
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,790
you have a motivation to not screw up
that thing and i think that that's often

2484
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:44,800
that thing and i think that that's often
 

2485
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,790
that thing and i think that that's often
missing that there's a there's no

2486
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:46,800
missing that there's a there's no
 

2487
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,470
missing that there's a there's no
incentive for the person to really

2488
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:48,480
incentive for the person to really
 

2489
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,550
incentive for the person to really
preserve something if they if they get a

2490
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:50,560
preserve something if they if they get a
 

2491
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,870
preserve something if they if they get a
little bit of attention from um dumping

2492
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:52,880
little bit of attention from um dumping
 

2493
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,270
little bit of attention from um dumping
on somebody's tick tock or something

2494
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:55,280
on somebody's tick tock or something
 

2495
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,550
on somebody's tick tock or something
that there's they don't pay any price

2496
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:56,560
that there's they don't pay any price
 

2497
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,349
that there's they don't pay any price
for it but on you have to kind of

2498
00:42:59,349 --> 00:42:59,359
for it but on you have to kind of
 

2499
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,109
for it but on you have to kind of
get decent with people when you have a

2500
00:43:01,109 --> 00:43:01,119
get decent with people when you have a
 

2501
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,190
get decent with people when you have a
shared stake you know a little secret so

2502
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:03,200
shared stake you know a little secret so
 

2503
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,870
shared stake you know a little secret so
get so github does a bit of that um

2504
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:06,880
get so github does a bit of that um
 

2505
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,750
get so github does a bit of that um
github was wonderful yes but i yeah i'm

2506
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:09,760
github was wonderful yes but i yeah i'm
 

2507
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,030
github was wonderful yes but i yeah i'm
tempted to play

2508
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:11,040
tempted to play
 

2509
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,990
tempted to play
uh the gerund back at you which is that

2510
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:14,000
uh the gerund back at you which is that
 

2511
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,550
uh the gerund back at you which is that
so github is currently is amazing but

2512
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:16,560
so github is currently is amazing but
 

2513
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,950
so github is currently is amazing but
the thing is if you have a stake then if

2514
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:18,960
the thing is if you have a stake then if
 

2515
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,710
the thing is if you have a stake then if
it's a social media platform they can

2516
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:20,720
it's a social media platform they can
 

2517
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,470
it's a social media platform they can
use the fact that you have a steak to

2518
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:22,480
use the fact that you have a steak to
 

2519
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,829
use the fact that you have a steak to
manipulate you because you want to

2520
00:43:23,829 --> 00:43:23,839
manipulate you because you want to
 

2521
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,069
manipulate you because you want to
preserve the steak so like

2522
00:43:26,069 --> 00:43:26,079
preserve the steak so like
 

2523
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,910
preserve the steak so like
right well this is why this all right

2524
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:27,920
right well this is why this all right
 

2525
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,190
right well this is why this all right
this gets us into the economics so

2526
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:29,200
this gets us into the economics so
 

2527
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,790
this gets us into the economics so
there's this thing called data dignity

2528
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:30,800
there's this thing called data dignity
 

2529
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,870
there's this thing called data dignity
that i've been studying for a long time

2530
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:32,880
that i've been studying for a long time
 

2531
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,550
that i've been studying for a long time
i wrote a book about an earlier version

2532
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:34,560
i wrote a book about an earlier version
 

2533
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,470
i wrote a book about an earlier version
of it called who owns the future

2534
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:36,480
of it called who owns the future
 

2535
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,589
of it called who owns the future
um and the the basic idea of it is that

2536
00:43:41,589 --> 00:43:41,599
um and the the basic idea of it is that
 

2537
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:42,790
um and the the basic idea of it is that
once again this is the third year

2538
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:42,800
once again this is the third year
 

2539
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,309
once again this is the third year
conversation the fascinating topic let

2540
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:44,319
conversation the fascinating topic let
 

2541
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:46,069
conversation the fascinating topic let
me do the fastest version of this i can

2542
00:43:46,069 --> 00:43:46,079
me do the fastest version of this i can
 

2543
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,710
me do the fastest version of this i can
do the fastest way i know how to do this

2544
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:48,720
do the fastest way i know how to do this
 

2545
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,630
do the fastest way i know how to do this
is to compare two features

2546
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:50,640
is to compare two features
 

2547
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,829
is to compare two features
all right

2548
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:51,839
all right
 

2549
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:52,630
all right
so

2550
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:52,640
so
 

2551
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,589
so
future one is then the normative one the

2552
00:43:55,589 --> 00:43:55,599
future one is then the normative one the
 

2553
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,349
future one is then the normative one the
one we're building right now and future

2554
00:43:57,349 --> 00:43:57,359
one we're building right now and future
 

2555
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,670
one we're building right now and future
two is going to be data dignity okay and

2556
00:43:59,670 --> 00:43:59,680
two is going to be data dignity okay and
 

2557
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,390
two is going to be data dignity okay and
um and i'm gonna use a particular

2558
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:02,400
um and i'm gonna use a particular
 

2559
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,309
um and i'm gonna use a particular
population i live on the hill and

2560
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:04,319
population i live on the hill and
 

2561
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,470
population i live on the hill and
berkeley and one of the features about

2562
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:06,480
berkeley and one of the features about
 

2563
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,990
berkeley and one of the features about
the hill is that as the climate changes

2564
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:08,000
the hill is that as the climate changes
 

2565
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,309
the hill is that as the climate changes
we might burn down and i'll lose our

2566
00:44:10,309 --> 00:44:10,319
we might burn down and i'll lose our
 

2567
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:11,750
we might burn down and i'll lose our
houses or die or something like it's

2568
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:11,760
houses or die or something like it's
 

2569
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,109
houses or die or something like it's
it's dangerous you know and it didn't

2570
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:13,119
it's dangerous you know and it didn't
 

2571
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:14,150
it's dangerous you know and it didn't
used to be

2572
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:14,160
used to be
 

2573
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,510
used to be
and so um who keeps us alive well the

2574
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:17,520
and so um who keeps us alive well the
 

2575
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,510
and so um who keeps us alive well the
city does the city does some things the

2576
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:19,520
city does the city does some things the
 

2577
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,589
city does the city does some things the
electric company kind of sort of maybe

2578
00:44:21,589 --> 00:44:21,599
electric company kind of sort of maybe
 

2579
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,349
electric company kind of sort of maybe
hopefully better

2580
00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:23,359
hopefully better
 

2581
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:26,069
hopefully better
individual people who own property take

2582
00:44:26,069 --> 00:44:26,079
individual people who own property take
 

2583
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:27,430
individual people who own property take
care of their property that's all nice

2584
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:27,440
care of their property that's all nice
 

2585
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,109
care of their property that's all nice
but there's this other middle layer

2586
00:44:29,109 --> 00:44:29,119
but there's this other middle layer
 

2587
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:30,790

and there are these robots doing the
 

2643
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,230
and there are these robots doing the
thing and the robots are good and they

2644
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:24,240
thing and the robots are good and they
 

2645
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,030
thing and the robots are good and they
can scale to more land and they're

2646
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:27,040
can scale to more land and they're
 

2647
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,950
can scale to more land and they're
actually good but then they're all these

2648
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:28,960
actually good but then they're all these
 

2649
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,470
actually good but then they're all these
people out of work and these people have

they're going to do
and and then somebody say well they go

2656
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:34,640
and and then somebody say well they go
 

2657
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,030
and and then somebody say well they go
on basic income whatever they become

2658
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:37,040
on basic income whatever they become

my problem with that solution is every
 

2663
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:43,510
my problem with that solution is every
time in history that you've had some

2664
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:43,520
time in history that you've had some
 

2665
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,030
time in history that you've had some
centralized thing that's stoling out the

2666
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:45,040
centralized thing that's stoling out the
 

2667
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,870
centralized thing that's stoling out the
benefits that things get seized by

2668
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:46,880
benefits that things get seized by
 

2669
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,710
benefits that things get seized by
people because it's too centralized and

2670
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:48,720
people because it's too centralized and
 

2671
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,230
people because it's too centralized and
it gets seized that's happened to every

communist experiment i can find

2674
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:52,640
communist experiment i can find
 

2675
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,510
communist experiment i can find
um so i think that turns into a poor

2676
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:55,520
um so i think that turns into a poor
 

2677
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,750
um so i think that turns into a poor
future that will be unstable i don't

2678
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:57,760
future that will be unstable i don't
 

2679
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,190
future that will be unstable i don't
think people will feel good in it i

2680
00:45:59,190 --> 00:45:59,200
think people will feel good in it i
 

2681
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,510
think people will feel good in it i
think it'll be a political disaster with

2682
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:01,520
think it'll be a political disaster with
 

2683
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,430
think it'll be a political disaster with
the sequence of people seizing this

2684
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:03,440
the sequence of people seizing this
 

2685
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,630
the sequence of people seizing this
central source of the the basic income

2686
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:06,640
central source of the the basic income
 

2687
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,150
central source of the the basic income
and you'll say oh no an algorithm can do

2688
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:08,160
and you'll say oh no an algorithm can do
 

2689
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,510
and you'll say oh no an algorithm can do
it then people will seize the algorithm

2690
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:09,520
it then people will seize the algorithm
 

2691
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,510
it then people will seize the algorithm
they'll see they'll seize control unless

2692
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:11,520
they'll see they'll seize control unless
 

2693
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,829
they'll see they'll seize control unless
the algorithm is decentralized and it's

2694
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:13,839
the algorithm is decentralized and it's
 

2695
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:16,550
the algorithm is decentralized and it's
impossible to cease to control yeah but

2696
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:16,560
impossible to cease to control yeah but
 

2697
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,069
impossible to cease to control yeah but
but uh

2698
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:18,079
but uh
 

2699
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,190
but uh

the bitcoin like like the things that we
 

2703
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:24,230
the bitcoin like like the things that we
think are decentralized are not

2704
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:24,240
think are decentralized are not
 

2705
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,829

gonna
 

2731
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:55,829
gonna
not only are we gonna sell our data to

2732
00:46:55,829 --> 00:46:55,839
not only are we gonna sell our data to
 

2733
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:56,870
not only are we gonna sell our data to
this place but we're going to make it

2734
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:56,880
this place but we're going to make it
 

2735
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:57,990
this place but we're going to make it
better than it would have been if they

2736
00:46:57,990 --> 00:46:58,000
better than it would have been if they
 

2737
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,030
better than it would have been if they
were just grabbing it without our

were just grabbing it without our
 

2739
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,510
were just grabbing it without our
cooperation and we're going to improve

cooperation and we're going to improve
 

2741
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,790
cooperation and we're going to improve
it we're going to make the robots more

2742

it we're going to make the robots more
 

2743
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,829
it we're going to make the robots more
effective we're going to make them

there should be a few people who do

2904
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:47,119
there should be a few people who do
 

2905
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,270
there should be a few people who do
really well a lot of people who do okay

2906
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:49,280
really well a lot of people who do okay
 

2907
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,630
really well a lot of people who do okay
and then we should have an expanding

2908
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:50,640
and then we should have an expanding
 

2909
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,109
and then we should have an expanding
economy reflecting more and more

2910
00:49:53,109 --> 00:49:53,119
economy reflecting more and more
 

2911
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:55,270
economy reflecting more and more
creativity and expertise flowing through

2912
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:55,280
creativity and expertise flowing through
 

2913
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,750
creativity and expertise flowing through
the network and that expanding economy

2914
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:57,760
the network and that expanding economy
 

2915
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,430
the network and that expanding economy
moves the result just a bit forward so

2916
00:49:59,430 --> 00:49:59,440
moves the result just a bit forward so
 

2917
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,510
moves the result just a bit forward so
more people are getting money out of it

2918
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:01,520
more people are getting money out of it
 

2919
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,030
more people are getting money out of it
than are putting money into it so it

2920
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:03,040
than are putting money into it so it
 

2921
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,870
than are putting money into it so it
gradually expands the economy and lifts

2922
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:04,880
gradually expands the economy and lifts
 

2923
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,870
gradually expands the economy and lifts
all boats and the in the society has to

2924
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:06,880
all boats and the in the society has to
 

2925
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:07,910
all boats and the in the society has to
support

2926
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:07,920
support
 

2927
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,069
support
the the the lower wing of the bell curve

2928
00:50:10,069 --> 00:50:10,079
the the the lower wing of the bell curve
 

2929
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:12,069
the the the lower wing of the bell curve
too but not universal basic income it

2930
00:50:12,069 --> 00:50:12,079
too but not universal basic income it
 

2931
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:13,270
too but not universal basic income it
has to be

2932
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:13,280
has to be
 

2933
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,190
has to be
for the you know because if it's an

2934
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:15,200
for the you know because if it's an
 

2935
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,790
for the you know because if it's an
honest if it's an honest economy there

2936
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:16,800
honest if it's an honest economy there
 

2937
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,750
honest if it's an honest economy there
will be

2938
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:17,760
will be
 

2939
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,829
will be
uh that lower wing and we we have to

2940
00:50:19,829 --> 00:50:19,839
uh that lower wing and we we have to
 

2941
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:21,349
uh that lower wing and we we have to
support those people there has to be a

2942
00:50:21,349 --> 00:50:21,359
support those people there has to be a
 

2943
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,870
support those people there has to be a
safety net um but um see what i believe

2944
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:24,880
safety net um but um see what i believe
 

2945
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,309
safety net um but um see what i believe
i'm not going to talk about ai but i

2946
00:50:26,309 --> 00:50:26,319
i'm not going to talk about ai but i
 

2947
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:27,990
i'm not going to talk about ai but i
will say

2948
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:28,000
will say
 

2949
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,270
will say
that i think there'll be more and more

2950
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:29,280
that i think there'll be more and more
 

2951
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,069
that i think there'll be more and more
algorithms that are useful and so i

2952
00:50:32,069 --> 00:50:32,079
algorithms that are useful and so i
 

2953
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:33,990
algorithms that are useful and so i
don't think everybody's going to be

2954
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:34,000
don't think everybody's going to be
 

2955
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,990
don't think everybody's going to be
supplying data to grounds keeping robots

2956
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:36,000
supplying data to grounds keeping robots
 

2957
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,430
supplying data to grounds keeping robots
nor do i think everybody's going to make

2958
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:37,440
nor do i think everybody's going to make
 

2959
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,790
nor do i think everybody's going to make
their living with tick-tock videos i

2960
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:38,800
their living with tick-tock videos i
 

2961
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,870
their living with tick-tock videos i
think in both cases there'll be a rather

2962
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:40,880
think in both cases there'll be a rather
 

2963
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,710
think in both cases there'll be a rather
small contingent

2964
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:42,720
small contingent
 

2965
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,549
small contingent
that do well enough at either of those

2966
00:50:44,549 --> 00:50:44,559
that do well enough at either of those
 

2967
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:47,109
that do well enough at either of those
things but i think there might be many

2968
00:50:47,109 --> 00:50:47,119
things but i think there might be many
 

2969
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:49,109
things but i think there might be many
many many many of those niches that

2970
00:50:49,109 --> 00:50:49,119
many many many of those niches that
 

2971
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,470
many many many of those niches that
start to evolve as they're more and more

2972
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:50,480
start to evolve as they're more and more
 

2973
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,470
start to evolve as they're more and more
algorithms more and more robots and it's

2974
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:52,480
algorithms more and more robots and it's
 

2975
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,470
algorithms more and more robots and it's
that large number

2976
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:54,480
that large number
 

2977
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,549
that large number
that will create the economic potential

2978
00:50:56,549 --> 00:50:56,559
that will create the economic potential
 

2979
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:58,549
that will create the economic potential
for a very large part of society to

2980
00:50:58,549 --> 00:50:58,559
for a very large part of society to
 

2981
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,510
for a very large part of society to
become members of new creative classes

2982
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:01,520
become members of new creative classes
 

2983
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,510
become members of new creative classes
do you think it's possible to

2984
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:03,520
do you think it's possible to
 

2985
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,470
do you think it's possible to
um

2986
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:04,480
um
 

2987
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,790
um
to create a social network that competes

2988
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:06,800
to create a social network that competes
 

2989
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,470
to create a social network that competes
with twitter and facebook that's large

2990
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:08,480
with twitter and facebook that's large
 

2991
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,069
with twitter and facebook that's large
and centralized in this way not

2992
00:51:10,069 --> 00:51:10,079
and centralized in this way not
 

2993
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:12,710
and centralized in this way not
centralized or large large how do we get

2994
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:12,720
centralized or large large how do we get
 

2995
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,430
centralized or large large how do we get
all right so i gotta tell you how to get

2996
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:15,440
all right so i gotta tell you how to get
 

2997
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,030
all right so i gotta tell you how to get
from what i'm talking how to get from

from what i'm talking how to get from
 

2999
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,030
from what i'm talking how to get from
where we are to anything kind of in the

3000
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:19,040
where we are to anything kind of in the
 

3001
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,430
where we are to anything kind of in the
zone of what i'm talking about is

3002
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:21,440
zone of what i'm talking about is
 

3003
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,630
zone of what i'm talking about is
challenging

3004

challenging
um

3006
00:51:23,589 --> 00:51:23,599
um
 

3007
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:26,069
um
i know some of the people who run like i

3015
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,470

i think he's really striving and

3016
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:36,480
i think he's really striving and
 

3017

a way to make it better
 

3021
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:42,230
a way to make it better
uh but is kind of like

3022

uh but is kind of like
 

3023
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,069
uh but is kind of like
it's very hard to do it while in flight

3024
00:51:44,069 --> 00:51:44,079
it's very hard to do it while in flight
 

3025

so jack dorsey to me is a fascinating
 

3031
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,589
so jack dorsey to me is a fascinating
study because i think his mind is in a

3032
00:51:51,589 --> 00:51:51,599
study because i think his mind is in a
 

3033
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:53,430
study because i think his mind is in a
lot of good places because he's a good

3034
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:53,440
lot of good places because he's a good
 

3035
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,069
lot of good places because he's a good
human being but there's a big titanic

3036
00:51:56,069 --> 00:51:56,079
human being but there's a big titanic
 

3037
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,430
human being but there's a big titanic
ship that's already moving in one

3038
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:57,440
ship that's already moving in one
 

3039
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,630
ship that's already moving in one
direction it's hard to know what to do

3040
00:51:58,630 --> 00:51:58,640
direction it's hard to know what to do
 

3041
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,230
direction it's hard to know what to do
with that i think that's the story of

3042
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:00,240
with that i think that's the story of
 

3043
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,750
with that i think that's the story of
twitter i think that's the story of

3044
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:01,760
twitter i think that's the story of
 

3045
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,589
twitter i think that's the story of
twitter um one of the things that i

3046
00:52:03,589 --> 00:52:03,599
twitter um one of the things that i
 

3047
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:05,190
twitter um one of the things that i
observe is that if you just want to look

3048
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:05,200
observe is that if you just want to look
 

3049
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,510
observe is that if you just want to look
at the human side meaning like how are

3050
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:07,520
at the human side meaning like how are
 

3051
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,430
at the human side meaning like how are
people being changed how do they feel

3052
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:09,440
people being changed how do they feel
 

3053
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,430
people being changed how do they feel
what does the culture like

3054
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:11,440
what does the culture like
 

3055
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,950
what does the culture like
almost all

3056
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:12,960
almost all
 

3057
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,510
almost all
of the social media platforms that get

3058
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:15,520
of the social media platforms that get
 

3059
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,510

3061
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,630
big have an initial sort of honeymoon
period where they're actually kind of

3062
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:18,640
period where they're actually kind of
 

3063
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,790
period where they're actually kind of
sweet and cute yeah like if you look at

3064
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:20,800
sweet and cute yeah like if you look at
 

3065
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,710
sweet and cute yeah like if you look at
the early years of twitter it was really

3066
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:22,720
the early years of twitter it was really
 

3067
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,230
the early years of twitter it was really
sweet and cute but also look at snap

3068
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:26,240
sweet and cute but also look at snap
 

3069
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,430
sweet and cute but also look at snap
tik tok

3070
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:27,440
tik tok
 

3071
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,309
tik tok
and then what happens is as they scale

3072
00:52:30,309 --> 00:52:30,319
and then what happens is as they scale
 

3073
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:31,990
and then what happens is as they scale
and the algorithms become more

3074
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:32,000
and the algorithms become more
 

3075
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,589
and the algorithms become more
influential instead of just the early

3076
00:52:33,589 --> 00:52:33,599
influential instead of just the early
 

3077
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:35,030
influential instead of just the early
people when it gets when it gets big

3078
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:35,040
people when it gets when it gets big
 

3079
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,390
people when it gets when it gets big
enough that it's the algorithm running

3080
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:36,400
enough that it's the algorithm running
 

3081
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,470
enough that it's the algorithm running
it then you start to see the rise of the

3082
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:38,480
it then you start to see the rise of the
 

3083
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,150
it then you start to see the rise of the
paranoid style and then they start to

3084
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:40,160
paranoid style and then they start to
 

3085
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,390
paranoid style and then they start to
get dark and we've seen that shift in

3086
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:42,400
get dark and we've seen that shift in
 

3087
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,829
get dark and we've seen that shift in
tik-tok rather recently but i feel like

3088
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:44,839
tik-tok rather recently but i feel like
 

3089
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:47,910
tik-tok rather recently but i feel like
that scaling reveals

3090
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:47,920
that scaling reveals
 

3091
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,510
that scaling reveals
the flaws within the incentives

3092
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:51,520
the flaws within the incentives
 

3093
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,030
the flaws within the incentives
i feel like i'm torturing you i'm still

3094
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:53,040
i feel like i'm torturing you i'm still
 

3095
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,069
i feel like i'm torturing you i'm still
no no it's not torture no because

3096
00:52:56,069 --> 00:52:56,079
no no it's not torture no because
 

3097
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:57,829
no no it's not torture no because
i i have hope

3098
00:52:57,829 --> 00:52:57,839
i i have hope
 

3099
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:00,309
i i have hope
uh for the world with with humans and

3100
00:53:00,309 --> 00:53:00,319
uh for the world with with humans and
 

3101
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:01,750
uh for the world with with humans and
have hope for a lot of things that

3102
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:01,760
have hope for a lot of things that
 

3103
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,549
have hope for a lot of things that
humans create including technology and i

3104
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:04,559
humans create including technology and i
 

3105
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:05,349
humans create including technology and i
just

3106
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:05,359
just
 

3107
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:07,510
just
uh i feel it is possible to create uh

3108
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:07,520
uh i feel it is possible to create uh
 

3109
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:11,750
uh i feel it is possible to create uh
social media platforms that incentivize

3110
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:11,760
social media platforms that incentivize
 

3111
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,430
social media platforms that incentivize
different things than the current i

3112
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:13,440
different things than the current i
 

3113
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,750
different things than the current i
think the current incentivization is

3114
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:15,760
think the current incentivization is
 

3115
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,910
think the current incentivization is
around like the dumbest possible thing

3116
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:17,920
around like the dumbest possible thing
 

3117
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,470
around like the dumbest possible thing
that was invented like 20 years ago or

3118
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:20,480
that was invented like 20 years ago or
 

3119
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,790
that was invented like 20 years ago or
however long and it just works and so

3120
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:22,800
however long and it just works and so
 

3121
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,630
however long and it just works and so
nobody's changing it i just think that

3122
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:24,640
nobody's changing it i just think that
 

3123
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,829
nobody's changing it i just think that
there could be a lot of innovation for

00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:26,839
there could be a lot of innovation for
 

3125
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:29,349
there could be a lot of innovation for
more see you kind of push back this idea

3126
00:53:29,349 --> 00:53:29,359
more see you kind of push back this idea
 

3127
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:31,829
more see you kind of push back this idea
that we can't know what long-term growth

3128
00:53:31,829 --> 00:53:31,839
that we can't know what long-term growth
 

3129
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:34,549
that we can't know what long-term growth
or happiness is i i if you give control

3130
00:53:34,549 --> 00:53:34,559
or happiness is i i if you give control
 

3131
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:37,589
or happiness is i i if you give control
to people to define what their long-term

the point is that we'll have like these

the point is that we'll have like these

market
and the the money is made

3242
00:55:41,829 --> 00:55:41,839
and the the money is made
 

3243
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:44,710
and the the money is made
by supporting that instead of

3244
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:44,720
by supporting that instead of
 

3245
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,470
by supporting that instead of
just grabbing people's attention in the

3246
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:46,480
just grabbing people's attention in the
 

3247
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,829

definitely how you get the lizard brain

3250
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:49,760
definitely how you get the lizard brain
 

3251
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:50,710
definitely how you get the lizard brain
yeah

3252
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:50,720
yeah
 

3253
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,880
yeah
okay so we're finally at the agreement

3254
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:52,890
okay so we're finally at the agreement
 

3255
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:55,589
okay so we're finally at the agreement
[Laughter]

3256
00:55:55,589 --> 00:55:55,599
[Laughter]
 

3257
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:56,470
[Laughter]
but i

3258
00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:56,480
but i
 

3259
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,109
but i
i just think that

3260
00:55:59,109 --> 00:55:59,119
i just think that
 

3261
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:00,950
i just think that
so yeah i'll tell you what how i think

3262
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:00,960
so yeah i'll tell you what how i think
 

3263
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,150
so yeah i'll tell you what how i think
uh

3264
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:02,160
uh
 

3265
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,069
uh
fake social media there's a few things

3266
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:04,079
fake social media there's a few things
 

3267
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,230
fake social media there's a few things
there's a few things so one i think

3268
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:06,240
there's a few things so one i think
 

3269
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,069
there's a few things so one i think
people should have complete control over

3270
00:56:08,069 --> 00:56:08,079
people should have complete control over
 

3271
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:10,630
people should have complete control over
their data and transparency of uh what

3272
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:10,640
their data and transparency of uh what
 

3273
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,870
their data and transparency of uh what
that data is and how it's being used if

3274
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:12,880
that data is and how it's being used if
 

3275
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,030
that data is and how it's being used if
they do hand over the control another

3276
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:15,040
they do hand over the control another
 

3277
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,710
they do hand over the control another
thing they should be able to delete walk

3278
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:16,720
thing they should be able to delete walk
 

3279
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,589
thing they should be able to delete walk
away with their data at any moment easy

3280
00:56:19,589 --> 00:56:19,599
away with their data at any moment easy
 

3281
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:21,030
away with their data at any moment easy
like with a single click of a button

3282
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:21,040
like with a single click of a button
 

3283
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,109
like with a single click of a button
maybe two buttons i don't know just

3284
00:56:23,109 --> 00:56:23,119
maybe two buttons i don't know just
 

3285
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:25,430
maybe two buttons i don't know just
easily walk away with their data

3286
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:25,440
easily walk away with their data
 

3287
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,230
easily walk away with their data
uh

3288
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:26,240
uh
 

3289
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,069
uh
the other is control of the algorithm

3290
00:56:28,069 --> 00:56:28,079
the other is control of the algorithm
 

3291
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,069
the other is control of the algorithm
individualized control of the algorithm

3292
00:56:30,069 --> 00:56:30,079
individualized control of the algorithm
 

3293
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:31,109
individualized control of the algorithm
for them

3294
00:56:31,109 --> 00:56:31,119
for them
 

3295
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:33,589
for them
so each one has their own algorithm each

3296
00:56:33,589 --> 00:56:33,599
so each one has their own algorithm each
 

3297
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,030
so each one has their own algorithm each
person has their own algorithm they get

3298
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:35,040
person has their own algorithm they get
 

3299
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,069
person has their own algorithm they get
to be the decider of uh what they see in

3300
00:56:38,069 --> 00:56:38,079
to be the decider of uh what they see in
 

3301
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:41,109
to be the decider of uh what they see in
this world and to me that i mean that's

3302
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:41,119
this world and to me that i mean that's
 

3303
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:43,750
this world and to me that i mean that's
i guess fundamentally decentralized

3304
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:43,760
i guess fundamentally decentralized
 

3305
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,990
i guess fundamentally decentralized
terms of the key decisions being made

3306
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:46,000
terms of the key decisions being made
 

3307
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,670
terms of the key decisions being made
but if that's made transparent i feel

3308
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:47,680
but if that's made transparent i feel
 

3309
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,390
but if that's made transparent i feel
like people will choose that system over

3310
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:50,400
like people will choose that system over

let's walk away from the term ai you're

3320
00:57:02,069 --> 00:57:02,079
let's walk away from the term ai you're
 

3321
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:02,950
let's walk away from the term ai you're
right

3322
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:02,960
right
 

3323
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,789
right
in this case you

3324
00:57:04,789 --> 00:57:04,799
in this case you
 

3325
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:06,950
in this case you
you have full control of the algorithms

3326
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:06,960
you have full control of the algorithms
 

3327
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,190
you have full control of the algorithms
that help you if you want

3328
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:09,200
that help you if you want
 

3329
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,190
that help you if you want
to use their help but you can also say

3330
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:11,200
to use their help but you can also say
 

3331
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,549
to use their help but you can also say
fu to those algorithms and just uh

3332
00:57:14,549 --> 00:57:14,559
fu to those algorithms and just uh

consume the raw beautiful waterfall

3334
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:18,160
consume the raw beautiful waterfall
 

3335
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,270
consume the raw beautiful waterfall
of the internet i think that

3336
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:21,280
of the internet i think that
 

3337
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,430
of the internet i think that
to me that's not only fixes social media

3338
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:23,440
to me that's not only fixes social media
 

3339
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,630
to me that's not only fixes social media
but i think it will make a lot more

3340
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:24,640
but i think it will make a lot more
 

3341
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,470
but i think it will make a lot more
money so i would like to challenge the

3342
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:26,480
money so i would like to challenge the
 

3343
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,309
money so i would like to challenge the
idea i know you're not presenting that

3344
00:57:28,309 --> 00:57:28,319
idea i know you're not presenting that
 

3345
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,030
idea i know you're not presenting that
but

3346
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:29,040
but
 

3347
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,750
but
that the only way to make a ton of money

3348
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:31,760
that the only way to make a ton of money
 

3349
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,069
that the only way to make a ton of money
is to operate like facebook is i think

3350
00:57:34,069 --> 00:57:34,079
is to operate like facebook is i think
 

3351
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:36,470
is to operate like facebook is i think
you can make more money by giving people

3352
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:36,480
you can make more money by giving people
 

3353
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,829
you can make more money by giving people

yeah i mean i certainly believe that

3356
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:39,760
yeah i mean i certainly believe that
 

3357
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,230
yeah i mean i certainly believe that

we worked we worked on this path of

3398
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:21,920
we worked we worked on this path of
 

3399
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:22,789
we worked we worked on this path of
saying let's make it all about

3400
00:58:22,789 --> 00:58:22,799
saying let's make it all about
 

3401
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,710
saying let's make it all about
transparency and consent and it was one

3402
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:24,720
transparency and consent and it was one
 

3403
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:27,589
transparency and consent and it was one
of the feeders that led to this huge uh

3404
00:58:27,589 --> 00:58:27,599
of the feeders that led to this huge uh
 

3405
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:29,349
of the feeders that led to this huge uh
data

and
 

3413
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,870
and
uh so therefore we've been able to have

3414
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:36,880
uh so therefore we've been able to have
 

3415
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,950
uh so therefore we've been able to have
uh empirical feedback on how that goes

3416
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:38,960
uh empirical feedback on how that goes
 

3417
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,030
uh empirical feedback on how that goes
and the problem is that

3418
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:41,040
and the problem is that
 

3419
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,150
and the problem is that
most people actually get stymied by the

3420
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:44,160
most people actually get stymied by the
 

3421
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,710
most people actually get stymied by the
complexity of that kind of management

3422
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:46,720
complexity of that kind of management
 

3423
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,150
complexity of that kind of management
they have trouble

3424
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:48,160
they have trouble
 

3425
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,789
they have trouble
and reasonably so i don't i'm like a

3426
00:58:50,789 --> 00:58:50,799
and reasonably so i don't i'm like a

3429
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,510

can figure out what's going on but uh i

3430
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:55,520
can figure out what's going on but uh i
 

3431
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,589
can figure out what's going on but uh i
most people really do and why and so

3432
00:58:57,589 --> 00:58:57,599
most people really do and why and so
 

3433
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:59,190
most people really do and why and so
there's the problem that it

there's the problem that it

01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:47,280
is that like there's this whole
 

3541
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,510
is that like there's this whole
complicated thing and not only do you

3542
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:49,520
complicated thing and not only do you
 

3543
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,030
complicated thing and not only do you
not need to know about it the truth is

3544
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:51,040
not need to know about it the truth is
 

3545
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,309
not need to know about it the truth is
you'd never be able to follow it if you

3546
01:00:52,309 --> 01:00:52,319
you'd never be able to follow it if you
 

3547
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:54,829
you'd never be able to follow it if you
tried and just like let the economic

3548
01:00:54,829 --> 01:00:54,839
tried and just like let the economic
 

3549
01:00:54,839 --> 01:00:57,589
tried and just like let the economic
incentives solve for this whole thing

3550
01:00:57,589 --> 01:00:57,599
incentives solve for this whole thing
 

3551
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,589
incentives solve for this whole thing
and and and that um

3552
01:00:59,589 --> 01:00:59,599
and and and that um
 

3553
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:01,270
and and and that um
in a sense every transaction is like a

3554
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:01,280
in a sense every transaction is like a
 

3555
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,510
in a sense every transaction is like a
neuron and a neural net if if he'd had

3556
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:03,520
neuron and a neural net if if he'd had
 

3557
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:05,589
neuron and a neural net if if he'd had
that metaphor he would have used it

3558
01:01:05,589 --> 01:01:05,599
that metaphor he would have used it
 

3559
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:07,349
that metaphor he would have used it
and uh let the whole thing settle to a

3560
01:01:07,349 --> 01:01:07,359
and uh let the whole thing settle to a
 

3561
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:10,309
and uh let the whole thing settle to a
solution and don't worry about it um i i

3562
01:01:10,309 --> 01:01:10,319
solution and don't worry about it um i i
 

3563
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:12,710
solution and don't worry about it um i i
think this idea of

3564
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:12,720
think this idea of
 

3565
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,710
think this idea of
having incentives that reduce complexity

3566
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:14,720
having incentives that reduce complexity
 

3567
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,670
having incentives that reduce complexity
for people can be made to work and and

3568
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:17,680
for people can be made to work and and
 

3569
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,190
for people can be made to work and and
that's an example of an algorithm that

3570
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:19,200
that's an example of an algorithm that
 

3571
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,789
that's an example of an algorithm that
could be manipulative or not going back

3572
01:01:20,789 --> 01:01:20,799
could be manipulative or not going back
 

3573
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:22,230
could be manipulative or not going back
to your question before about can you do

3574
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:22,240
to your question before about can you do
 

3575
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,549
to your question before about can you do
it in a way that's not manipulative and

3576
01:01:24,549 --> 01:01:24,559
it in a way that's not manipulative and
 

3577
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:25,829
it in a way that's not manipulative and
i would say

3578
01:01:25,829 --> 01:01:25,839
i would say
 

3579
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:26,870
i would say
um

3580
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:26,880
um
 

3581
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,710
um
a github like if you just have this

is it possible i think it is i'm not
 

3589
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:38,549
is it possible i think it is i'm not
gonna be able to unsee that idea

3590
01:01:38,549 --> 01:01:38,559
gonna be able to unsee that idea
 

3591
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:40,309
gonna be able to unsee that idea

technology algorithms tools can empower
 

3653
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,150
technology algorithms tools can empower
and that's that's the thing for humans

3654
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:42,160
and that's that's the thing for humans

to to connect to collaborate and so on
can we uh

3658
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:46,160
can we uh
 

3659
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,829
can we uh
can we upset more people a little bit

3660
01:02:47,829 --> 01:02:47,839
can we upset more people a little bit
 

3661
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:50,150
can we upset more people a little bit
you already i thought maybe we'd have to

3662
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:50,160
you already i thought maybe we'd have to
 

3663
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,109
you already i thought maybe we'd have to
try no no can we uh can i ask you

3664
01:02:53,109 --> 01:02:53,119
try no no can we uh can i ask you
 

3665
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:55,510
try no no can we uh can i ask you
to elaborate because i my intuition was

3666
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:55,520
to elaborate because i my intuition was
 

3667
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,870
to elaborate because i my intuition was
that you would be a supporter of

3668
01:02:56,870 --> 01:02:56,880
that you would be a supporter of
 

3669
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,710
that you would be a supporter of
something like cryptocurrency and

3670
01:02:58,710 --> 01:02:58,720
something like cryptocurrency and
 

3671
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,549
something like cryptocurrency and
bitcoin because it is fundamentally

3672
01:03:00,549 --> 01:03:00,559
bitcoin because it is fundamentally
 

3673
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:03,670
bitcoin because it is fundamentally
emphasizes decentralization what do you

3674
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:03,680
emphasizes decentralization what do you
 

3675
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,670
emphasizes decentralization what do you
so can you elaborate

3676
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:05,680
so can you elaborate
 

3677
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,910
so can you elaborate
yeah okay look your thoughts on bitcoin

3678
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:07,920
yeah okay look your thoughts on bitcoin
 

3679

thought oh my god we're applying all of
this fancy thought and all these very

3698
01:03:33,589 --> 01:03:33,599
this fancy thought and all these very

this fancy thought and all these very
careful distributed security measures to

01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:36,400
careful distributed security measures to

01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,390
careful distributed security measures to
recreate the gold standard

3702
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:38,400
recreate the gold standard

it's so useless from an economic point

3708
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:43,760
it's so useless from an economic point
 

3709
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,910
it's so useless from an economic point
of view so it's always and then the

of view so it's always and then the
 

3711
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,910
of view so it's always and then the
other thing is using computational

01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:47,920
other thing is using computational
 

3713
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:50,309
other thing is using computational

the atmosphere obviously a lot of people
 

3719
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,950
the atmosphere obviously a lot of people
know that now but we knew that at the

3720
01:03:56,950 --> 01:03:56,960
know that now but we knew that at the
 

3721
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,549

people saying oh my god i think this
thing scales it's a carbon disaster you

3728
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:03,760
thing scales it's a carbon disaster you
 

3729
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,230
thing scales it's a carbon disaster you
know and and um

3730

thoughtful about this you should uh if
 

3747
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:24,870
thoughtful about this you should uh if
you haven't you should interview vitalik

3748
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:24,880
you haven't you should interview vitalik
 

3749
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,870
you haven't you should interview vitalik
buter in some time yeah interviewed him

3750

buter in some time yeah interviewed him
 

3751
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,270
buter in some time yeah interviewed him
twice okay so like there are people in

twice okay so like there are people in
 

3753
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,549
twice okay so like there are people in
the community who are trying to be

3754
01:04:30,549 --> 01:04:30,559
the community who are trying to be
 

3755
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:31,750
the community who are trying to be
thoughtful and trying to figure out how

3756
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:31,760
thoughtful and trying to figure out how
 

3757
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,910
thoughtful and trying to figure out how
to do this better it has nice properties

3758
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:33,920
to do this better it has nice properties
 

3759
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,190
to do this better it has nice properties
though right so the one of the nice

3760
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:35,200
though right so the one of the nice
 

3761
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,630
though right so the one of the nice
problems is that like government

3762
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:36,640
problems is that like government
 

3763
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,870
problems is that like government
centralized it's hard to control

3764
01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:38,880
centralized it's hard to control
 

3765
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,870
centralized it's hard to control
uh and then the other one to fix some of

3766
01:04:40,870 --> 01:04:40,880
uh and then the other one to fix some of
 

3767
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,230
uh and then the other one to fix some of
the issues that you're referring to i'm

3768
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:42,240
the issues that you're referring to i'm
 

3769
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,150
the issues that you're referring to i'm
sort of playing devil's advocate here is

3770
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:44,160
sort of playing devil's advocate here is
 

3771
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,430
sort of playing devil's advocate here is
you know there's lightning network

3772
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:45,440
you know there's lightning network
 

3773
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,710
you know there's lightning network
there's ideas how to how you uh build

3774
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:48,720
there's ideas how to how you uh build
 

3775
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,390
there's ideas how to how you uh build
stuff on top of bitcoin similar with

3776
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:50,400
stuff on top of bitcoin similar with
 

3777
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,789
stuff on top of bitcoin similar with
gold that allow you to have this kind of

3778
01:04:52,789 --> 01:04:52,799
gold that allow you to have this kind of
 

3779
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:55,589
gold that allow you to have this kind of
vibrant economy that operates not on the

blockchain but outside the blockchain
and uses uh bitcoin for uh

3784
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:00,880
and uses uh bitcoin for uh
 

3785
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,390
and uses uh bitcoin for uh
for like checking the security of those

3786
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:02,400
for like checking the security of those
 

3787
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,470
for like checking the security of those
transactions so bitcoin's not new it's

3788

example of it creating economic growth

3794
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:12,880
example of it creating economic growth
 

3795
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,309
example of it creating economic growth
there was this obsession with the idea

3796
01:05:14,309 --> 01:05:14,319
there was this obsession with the idea
 

3797
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:16,309
there was this obsession with the idea
that government was the problem that

3798
01:05:16,309 --> 01:05:16,319
that government was the problem that
 

3799
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:18,630
that government was the problem that
idea that government's the problem let's

3800

idea that government's the problem let's
 

3801
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:21,270
idea that government's the problem let's
say government earned that wrath

3802
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:21,280
say government earned that wrath
 

3803

honestly
 

3805
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,789
honestly
because if you look at some of the

3806
01:05:24,789 --> 01:05:24,799
because if you look at some of the

3810
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:28,960
recent decades it's not a pretty story
 

3811
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:29,910
recent decades it's not a pretty story
like

3812
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:29,920
like
 

3813
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,670
like
after

3814
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:31,680
after
 

3815
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,349
after
after a very small number of people in

3816
01:05:33,349 --> 01:05:33,359
after a very small number of people in
 

3817
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:35,990
after a very small number of people in
the u.s government decided to bomb and

southeast asia
 

3823
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,470
southeast asia
it's hard to come back and say oh

3824
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:40,480
it's hard to come back and say oh
 

3825
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,710
it's hard to come back and say oh
government's this great thing but

3826
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:42,720
government's this great thing but
 

3827
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,789
government's this great thing but
uh then

3828
01:05:44,789 --> 01:05:44,799
uh then
 

3829
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:47,270
uh then
the problem is that this resistance to

3830
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:47,280
the problem is that this resistance to
 

3831
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,789
the problem is that this resistance to
government

3832
01:05:48,789 --> 01:05:48,799
government
 

3833
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:51,109
government
is basically resistance to politics it's

3834
01:05:51,109 --> 01:05:51,119
is basically resistance to politics it's
 

3835
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:52,309
is basically resistance to politics it's
a way of saying

3836
01:05:52,309 --> 01:05:52,319
a way of saying
 

3837
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:53,990
a way of saying
if i can get rich nobody should bother

3838
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:54,000
if i can get rich nobody should bother
 

3839
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,910
if i can get rich nobody should bother
me it's a way of not of not having

3840
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:55,920
me it's a way of not of not having
 

3841
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,750
me it's a way of not of not having
obligations to others and that

3842
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:57,760
obligations to others and that
 

3843
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,630
obligations to others and that
ultimately is a very suspect motivation

3844
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:00,640
ultimately is a very suspect motivation
 

3845
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,549
ultimately is a very suspect motivation
but does that mean

3846
01:06:02,549 --> 01:06:02,559
but does that mean
 

3847
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:06,549
but does that mean
that the impulse that the government um

3848
01:06:06,549 --> 01:06:06,559
that the impulse that the government um
 

3849
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:09,270
that the impulse that the government um
should not overreach its power is flawed

3850
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:09,280
should not overreach its power is flawed
 

3851
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:12,069
should not overreach its power is flawed
well i mean what i want to ask you to do

3852
01:06:12,069 --> 01:06:12,079
well i mean what i want to ask you to do
 

3853
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:13,990
well i mean what i want to ask you to do
is to replace the word government with

3854

01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,510
is to replace the word government with
politics

3856
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:15,520
politics
 

3857
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:18,470
politics
like our politics is people having to

3858
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:18,480
like our politics is people having to
 

3859
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,990
like our politics is people having to
deal with each other

3860
01:06:19,990 --> 01:06:20,000
deal with each other
 

3861
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,910
deal with each other
my theory about freedom

3862
01:06:21,910 --> 01:06:21,920
my theory about freedom
 

3863
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,910
my theory about freedom
is that the only authentic form of

3864
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:23,920
is that the only authentic form of
 

3865
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:26,390
is that the only authentic form of
freedom is perpetual annoyance that

3866
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:26,400
freedom is perpetual annoyance that
 

3867
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,230
freedom is perpetual annoyance that
all right so

3868
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:28,240
all right so
 

3869
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,069
all right so
annoyance means you're actually dealing

3870
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:30,079
annoyance means you're actually dealing
 

3871
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:31,750
annoyance means you're actually dealing
with people because people are annoying

3872
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:31,760
with people because people are annoying
 

3873
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,750
with people because people are annoying
perpetual means that that annoyance is

3874
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:33,760
perpetual means that that annoyance is
 

3875
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:36,069
perpetual means that that annoyance is
survivable so it doesn't destroy us all

3876
01:06:36,069 --> 01:06:36,079
survivable so it doesn't destroy us all
 

3877
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:37,750
survivable so it doesn't destroy us all
so if you have perpetual annoyance then

3878
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:37,760
so if you have perpetual annoyance then
 

3879
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,670
so if you have perpetual annoyance then
you have freedom and that's politics

3880
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:39,680
you have freedom and that's politics
 

3881
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,109
you have freedom and that's politics
that's politics if you don't have

3882
01:06:41,109 --> 01:06:41,119
that's politics if you don't have
 

3883
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:42,789
that's politics if you don't have
perpetual annoyance

3884
01:06:42,789 --> 01:06:42,799
perpetual annoyance
 

3885
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:44,630

and the whole point was to talk about
 

4327
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:33,830
and the whole point was to talk about
how bad network effect was that it

4328
01:14:33,830 --> 01:14:33,840
how bad network effect was that it
 

4329
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,709
how bad network effect was that it
always created distortions that ruined

but then somehow even after the pandemic
we think of viral as this good thing

4340
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:46,960
we think of viral as this good thing
 

4341
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,470
we think of viral as this good thing
because we imagine ourselves as the

4345
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,709
virus right we want to be on the on the
beneficiary side of it but of course

4346
01:14:52,709 --> 01:14:52,719
beneficiary side of it but of course
 

4347
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:54,470
beneficiary side of it but of course
you're not likely to be

4348
01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:54,480
you're not likely to be
 

4349
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,310
you're not likely to be

about like it's intrinsically a ponzi
 

4375

about like it's intrinsically a ponzi
scheme like you know the early people

4376
01:15:27,669 --> 01:15:27,679
scheme like you know the early people
 

4377
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:30,149
scheme like you know the early people
have more than the later people and the

have more than the later people and the

01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:32,550

further down the chain you get the more

01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:32,560
further down the chain you get the more
 

4381
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,790
further down the chain you get the more
you're subject to gambling like dynamics

4382
01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:34,800
you're subject to gambling like dynamics
 

4383
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,229
you're subject to gambling like dynamics
where it's more and more random and more

4384
01:15:36,229 --> 01:15:36,239
where it's more and more random and more
 

4385
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:37,430
where it's more and more random and more
and more subject to weird network

4386
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:37,440
and more subject to weird network
 

4387
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,510

4389
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,990
effects and whatnot unless you're a very
small player uh perhaps and you're just

4390
01:15:41,990 --> 01:15:42,000
small player uh perhaps and you're just
 

4391
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,669
small player uh perhaps and you're just
buying something but even then you'll be

4392
01:15:43,669 --> 01:15:43,679
buying something but even then you'll be
 

4393
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:45,350
buying something but even then you'll be
subject to fluctuations because the

4394
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:45,360
subject to fluctuations because the
 

4395
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:48,070
subject to fluctuations because the
whole thing is just kind of it like that

4396
01:15:48,070 --> 01:15:48,080
whole thing is just kind of it like that
 

4397
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,229
whole thing is just kind of it like that
as it fluctuates it's gonna wave around

4398
01:15:50,229 --> 01:15:50,239
as it fluctuates it's gonna wave around
 

4399
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:52,790
as it fluctuates it's gonna wave around
the little people more and

4400
01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:52,800
the little people more and
 

4401
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,630
the little people more and
they i remember the conversation turned

4402
01:15:54,630 --> 01:15:54,640
they i remember the conversation turned
 

4403
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,310
they i remember the conversation turned
to gambling because gambling's a pretty

4404
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:56,320
to gambling because gambling's a pretty
 

4405
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,709
to gambling because gambling's a pretty
large economic sector and it's always

4406
01:15:58,709 --> 01:15:58,719
large economic sector and it's always
 

4407
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:00,390
large economic sector and it's always
struck me as being

4408
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:00,400
struck me as being
 

4409
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,390
struck me as being
non-productive like somebody goes to las

4410
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:02,400
non-productive like somebody goes to las
 

4411
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,470
non-productive like somebody goes to las
vegas and loses money and

4412
01:16:04,470 --> 01:16:04,480
vegas and loses money and
 

4413
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,229
vegas and loses money and
so one argument is well they got

4414
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:06,239
so one argument is well they got
 

4415
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:07,430
so one argument is well they got
entertainment they paid for

4416
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:07,440
entertainment they paid for
 

4417
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,110
entertainment they paid for
entertainment as they lost money so

4418
01:16:09,110 --> 01:16:09,120
entertainment as they lost money so
 

4419
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:12,550
entertainment as they lost money so
that's fine and the in las vegas does up

4420
01:16:12,550 --> 01:16:12,560
that's fine and the in las vegas does up
 

4421
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:13,990
that's fine and the in las vegas does up
the losing of money in an entertaining

4422
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:14,000
the losing of money in an entertaining
 

4423
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,910
the losing of money in an entertaining
way so why not it's like going to a show

4424
01:16:15,910 --> 01:16:15,920
way so why not it's like going to a show
 

4425
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:17,510
way so why not it's like going to a show
so that's one argument

4426
01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:17,520
so that's one argument
 

4427
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:19,110
so that's one argument
the argument that was made to me was

4428
01:16:19,110 --> 01:16:19,120
the argument that was made to me was
 

4429
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:20,709
the argument that was made to me was
different from that it's that no what

4430
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:20,719
different from that it's that no what
 

4431
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:21,830
different from that it's that no what
they're doing is they're getting a

4432
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:21,840
they're doing is they're getting a
 

4433
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,149
they're doing is they're getting a
chance to experience hope and a lot of

4434
01:16:24,149 --> 01:16:24,159
chance to experience hope and a lot of
 

4435
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:25,669
chance to experience hope and a lot of
people don't get that chance and so

4436
01:16:25,669 --> 01:16:25,679
people don't get that chance and so
 

4437
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:26,950
people don't get that chance and so
that's really worth it even if they're

4438
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:26,960
that's really worth it even if they're
 

4439
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,390
that's really worth it even if they're
going to lose they have that moment of

4440
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:28,400
going to lose they have that moment of
 

4441
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,830
going to lose they have that moment of
hope and they need to be able to

4442
01:16:29,830 --> 01:16:29,840
hope and they need to be able to
 

4443
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,110
hope and they need to be able to
experience that

4444
01:16:31,110 --> 01:16:31,120
experience that
 

4445
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:34,390
experience that
and this is a very interesting argument

4446
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:34,400
and this is a very interesting argument
 

4447
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,790
and this is a very interesting argument
um that's so heartbreaking because uh

4448
01:16:36,790 --> 01:16:36,800
um that's so heartbreaking because uh
 

4449

which describes our universe as one that
learns its own physical laws

4654
01:20:06,229 --> 01:20:06,239

 

4655
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:07,990

that's a trippy and beautiful and

4656
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:08,000
that's a trippy and beautiful and
 

4657
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,510
that's a trippy and beautiful and
powerful idea

4658
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:09,520
powerful idea
 

4659
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,430
powerful idea
what are what would you say are the key

4660
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:11,440
what are what would you say are the key
 

4661
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:14,070
what are what would you say are the key
ideas in this paper ah okay well i

4662
01:20:14,070 --> 01:20:14,080
ideas in this paper ah okay well i
 

4663
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,750
ideas in this paper ah okay well i
should say uh

4664
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:15,760
should say uh
 

4665
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,629
should say uh
that paper reflected work from last year

4666
01:20:18,629 --> 01:20:18,639
that paper reflected work from last year
 

4667
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:20,870
that paper reflected work from last year
and the project the program has moved

4668
01:20:20,870 --> 01:20:20,880
and the project the program has moved
 

4669
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,790
and the project the program has moved
quite a lot so it's a little there's a

4670
01:20:22,790 --> 01:20:22,800
quite a lot so it's a little there's a
 

4671
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,229
quite a lot so it's a little there's a
lot of stuff that's not published that

4672
01:20:24,229 --> 01:20:24,239
lot of stuff that's not published that
 

4673
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:25,830
lot of stuff that's not published that
i'm quite excited about so i have to

4674
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:25,840
i'm quite excited about so i have to
 

4675
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:29,430
i'm quite excited about so i have to
kind of keep my frame in that in that uh

4676
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:29,440
kind of keep my frame in that in that uh
 

4677
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,030
kind of keep my frame in that in that uh
last year's thing so i have to try to be

4678
01:20:31,030 --> 01:20:31,040
last year's thing so i have to try to be
 

4679
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:33,750
last year's thing so i have to try to be
a little careful about that

4680
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:33,760
a little careful about that
 

4681
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,270
a little careful about that
we can think about it in a few different

4682
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:35,280
we can think about it in a few different
 

4683
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,189
we can think about it in a few different
ways um

4684
01:20:37,189 --> 01:20:37,199
ways um
 

4685
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:39,669
ways um
the core of the paper the the technical

4686
01:20:39,669 --> 01:20:39,679
the core of the paper the the technical
 

4687
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:43,750
the core of the paper the the technical
core of it is a triple correspondence

4688
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:43,760
core of it is a triple correspondence
 

4689
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,910
core of it is a triple correspondence
one part of it was

4690
01:20:45,910 --> 01:20:45,920
one part of it was
 

4691
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:47,669
one part of it was
already established and then another

4692
01:20:47,669 --> 01:20:47,679
already established and then another
 

4693
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:50,310
already established and then another
part is in the process the part that was

4694
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:50,320
part is in the process the part that was
 

4695
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,310
part is in the process the part that was
established was

01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,229
established was
of course understanding different

01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:57,270
of course understanding different
theories of physics as matrix models the

4700
01:20:57,270 --> 01:20:57,280
theories of physics as matrix models the

fresher is understanding those as a

4706
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:01,760
fresher is understanding those as a
 

4707
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,590
fresher is understanding those as a
machining machine learning system so

4708
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:03,600
machining machine learning system so
 

4709
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,510
machining machine learning system so
that we could move fluidly between these

4710
01:21:05,510 --> 01:21:05,520
that we could move fluidly between these
 

4711
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:08,229
that we could move fluidly between these
different ways of describing systems and

4712
01:21:08,229 --> 01:21:08,239
different ways of describing systems and
 

4713
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:10,790
different ways of describing systems and
the reason to want to do that is to just

4714
01:21:10,790 --> 01:21:10,800
the reason to want to do that is to just
 

4715
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:15,189
the reason to want to do that is to just
have more tools and more options because

4716
01:21:15,189 --> 01:21:15,199

 

4717
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:17,110

uh well theoretical physics is really

4718
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:17,120
uh well theoretical physics is really
 

4719
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,910
uh well theoretical physics is really
hard and a lot of programs have kind of

4720
01:21:19,910 --> 01:21:19,920
hard and a lot of programs have kind of
 

4721
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:21,590
hard and a lot of programs have kind of
um

4722
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:21,600
um
 

4723
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,990
um
run into a state where they feel a

4724
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:24,000
run into a state where they feel a
 

4725
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,070
run into a state where they feel a
little stalled i guess i can i i want to

4726
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:26,080
little stalled i guess i can i i want to
 

4727
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,270
little stalled i guess i can i i want to
be delicate about this because i'm not a

4728
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:27,280
be delicate about this because i'm not a
 

4729
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:28,870
be delicate about this because i'm not a
physicist i'm the computer scientist

4730
01:21:28,870 --> 01:21:28,880
physicist i'm the computer scientist
 

4731
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,310
physicist i'm the computer scientist
collaborating so

4732
01:21:30,310 --> 01:21:30,320
collaborating so
 

4733
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,390
collaborating so
um i don't mean to diss anybody's so

4734
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:32,400
um i don't mean to diss anybody's so
 

4735
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,550
um i don't mean to diss anybody's so
this is almost like gives a framework

4736
01:21:34,550 --> 01:21:34,560
this is almost like gives a framework
 

4737
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,950
this is almost like gives a framework
for generating new ideas in physics as

4738
01:21:36,950 --> 01:21:36,960
for generating new ideas in physics as
 

4739
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:38,950
for generating new ideas in physics as
you as we start to publish more about

4740
01:21:38,950 --> 01:21:38,960
you as we start to publish more about
 

4741
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,790
you as we start to publish more about
where it's gone i think you'll start to

4742
01:21:40,790 --> 01:21:40,800
where it's gone i think you'll start to
 

4743
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:43,430
where it's gone i think you'll start to
see there's there's tools

4744
01:21:43,430 --> 01:21:43,440
see there's there's tools
 

4745
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,669
see there's there's tools
and ways of thinking about

4746
01:21:45,669 --> 01:21:45,679
and ways of thinking about
 

4747
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:47,750
and ways of thinking about
theories that

4748
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:47,760
theories that
 

4749
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:51,030
theories that
i think open up some new paths uh that

4750
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:51,040
i think open up some new paths uh that
 

4751
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:53,430
i think open up some new paths uh that
that will be of interest um

4752
01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:53,440
that will be of interest um
 

4753
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:55,110
that will be of interest um
there's the technical core of it which

4754
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:55,120
there's the technical core of it which
 

4755
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,470
there's the technical core of it which
is this idea this idea of a

4756
01:21:56,470 --> 01:21:56,480
is this idea this idea of a
 

4757
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,709
is this idea this idea of a
correspondence to give you more facility

4758
01:21:58,709 --> 01:21:58,719
correspondence to give you more facility
 

4759
01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:00,870
correspondence to give you more facility
but then there's also the storytelling

4760
01:22:00,870 --> 01:22:00,880
but then there's also the storytelling
 

4761
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:03,189
but then there's also the storytelling
part of it and this is something

4762
01:22:03,189 --> 01:22:03,199
part of it and this is something
 

4763
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:04,470
part of it and this is something
um

4764
01:22:04,470 --> 01:22:04,480
um
 

4765
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:07,830
um
lee loves stories and i do and the idea

4766
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:07,840
lee loves stories and i do and the idea
 

4767
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,870
lee loves stories and i do and the idea
here is that

4768
01:22:10,870 --> 01:22:10,880
here is that
 

4769
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:13,590
here is that
a typical

4770
01:22:13,590 --> 01:22:13,600
a typical
 

4771
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,470
a typical
way of thinking about physics is that

4772
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:16,480
way of thinking about physics is that
 

4773
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:18,229
way of thinking about physics is that
there's some kind of starting condition

4774
01:22:18,229 --> 01:22:18,239
there's some kind of starting condition
 

4775
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:19,750
there's some kind of starting condition
and then there's some principle by which

4776
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:19,760
and then there's some principle by which
 

4777
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:20,870
and then there's some principle by which
the starting

4778
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:20,880
the starting
 

4779
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:23,270
the starting
condition evolves

4780
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:23,280
condition evolves
 

4781
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:25,510
condition evolves
uh and the question is like why the

4782
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:25,520
uh and the question is like why the
 

4783
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:28,390
uh and the question is like why the
starting condition like how how

4784
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:28,400
starting condition like how how
 

4785
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,149
starting condition like how how
oh the starting condition has to get

4786
01:22:30,149 --> 01:22:30,159
oh the starting condition has to get
 

4787
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:32,470
oh the starting condition has to get
kind of per this has to be fine-tuned

4788
01:22:32,470 --> 01:22:32,480
kind of per this has to be fine-tuned
 

4789
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:33,830
kind of per this has to be fine-tuned
and all these things about it have to be

4790
01:22:33,830 --> 01:22:33,840
and all these things about it have to be
 

4791
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:34,870
and all these things about it have to be
kind of

4792
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:34,880
kind of
 

4793
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,950
kind of
perfect and so we were thinking well

4794
01:22:36,950 --> 01:22:36,960
perfect and so we were thinking well
 

4795
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,790
perfect and so we were thinking well
look what if

4796
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:38,800
look what if
 

4797
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,950
look what if
we could push the storytelling about

4798
01:22:40,950 --> 01:22:40,960
we could push the storytelling about
 

4799
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,310
we could push the storytelling about
where the universe comes from much

4800
01:22:42,310 --> 01:22:42,320
where the universe comes from much
 

4801
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,550
where the universe comes from much
further back by starting with really

4802
01:22:44,550 --> 01:22:44,560
further back by starting with really
 

4803
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,470
further back by starting with really
simple things that evolve and then

4804
01:22:46,470 --> 01:22:46,480
simple things that evolve and then
 

4805
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:47,750
simple things that evolve and then
through that evolution explain how

4806
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:47,760
through that evolution explain how
 

4807
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,110
through that evolution explain how
things got to be how they are through

4808
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:49,120
things got to be how they are through
 

4809
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:52,229
things got to be how they are through
very simple principles right and so

4810
01:22:52,229 --> 01:22:52,239
very simple principles right and so
 

4811
01:22:52,239 --> 01:22:54,790
very simple principles right and so
we've been um exploring a variety of

4812
01:22:54,790 --> 01:22:54,800
we've been um exploring a variety of
 

4813
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:57,030
we've been um exploring a variety of
ways to push the the start of the

4814
01:22:57,030 --> 01:22:57,040
ways to push the the start of the
 

4815
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,430
ways to push the the start of the
storytelling further and further back

4816
01:22:59,430 --> 01:22:59,440
storytelling further and further back
 

4817
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:02,390
storytelling further and further back
which um and it's an interesting

4818
01:23:02,390 --> 01:23:02,400
which um and it's an interesting
 

4819
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:03,830
which um and it's an interesting
it's really kind of interesting because

4820
01:23:03,830 --> 01:23:03,840
it's really kind of interesting because
 

4821
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:04,870
it's really kind of interesting because
like uh

4822
01:23:04,870 --> 01:23:04,880
like uh
 

4823
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:08,310
like uh
um for all of his lee is uh sometimes

4824
01:23:08,310 --> 01:23:08,320
um for all of his lee is uh sometimes
 

4825
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:10,550
um for all of his lee is uh sometimes
considered to be

4826
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:10,560
considered to be
 

4827
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:11,350
considered to be
uh

4828
01:23:11,350 --> 01:23:11,360
uh
 

4829
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:13,110
uh
to have a radical quality in the physics

4830
01:23:13,110 --> 01:23:13,120
to have a radical quality in the physics
 

4831
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:15,030
to have a radical quality in the physics
world but um

4832
01:23:15,030 --> 01:23:15,040
world but um
 

4833
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,510
world but um
uh he still is like no this is gonna be

4834
01:23:17,510 --> 01:23:17,520
uh he still is like no this is gonna be
 

4835
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:19,590
uh he still is like no this is gonna be
like the kind of time we're talking

4836
01:23:19,590 --> 01:23:19,600
like the kind of time we're talking
 

4837
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,430
like the kind of time we're talking
about in which evolution happens is the

4838
01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:21,440
about in which evolution happens is the
 

4839
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:22,950
about in which evolution happens is the
same time we're now and we're talking

4840
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:22,960
same time we're now and we're talking
 

4841
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,950
same time we're now and we're talking
about something that starts

4842
01:23:24,950 --> 01:23:24,960
about something that starts
 

4843
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:26,550
about something that starts
and continues and i'm like well what if

4844
01:23:26,550 --> 01:23:26,560
and continues and i'm like well what if
 

4845
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,629
and continues and i'm like well what if
there's some other kind of time that's

4846
01:23:28,629 --> 01:23:28,639
there's some other kind of time that's
 

4847
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:30,310
there's some other kind of time that's
time-like and well that sounds like

4848
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:30,320
time-like and well that sounds like
 

4849
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:31,830
time-like and well that sounds like
metaphysics but

4850
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:31,840
metaphysics but
 

4851
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,550
metaphysics but
there's an ambiguity you know like

4852
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:34,560
there's an ambiguity you know like
 

4853
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,629
there's an ambiguity you know like
it has to start from something and uh

4854
01:23:36,629 --> 01:23:36,639
it has to start from something and uh
 

4855
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:38,310
it has to start from something and uh
it's kind of an interesting so there's

4856
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:38,320
it's kind of an interesting so there's
 

4857
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,550
it's kind of an interesting so there's
this uh

4858
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:40,560
this uh
 

4859
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,070
this uh
a lot of the math can be thought of

4860
01:23:42,070 --> 01:23:42,080
a lot of the math can be thought of
 

4861
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,990
a lot of the math can be thought of
either way which is kind of interesting

4862
01:23:43,990 --> 01:23:44,000
either way which is kind of interesting
 

4863
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,990
either way which is kind of interesting
so it pushes so far back that basically

4864
01:23:45,990 --> 01:23:46,000
so it pushes so far back that basically
 

4865
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,510
so it pushes so far back that basically
all the things we take for granted and

4866
01:23:47,510 --> 01:23:47,520
all the things we take for granted and
 

4867
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:51,030
all the things we take for granted and
physics start becoming and emerge

4868
01:23:51,030 --> 01:23:51,040
physics start becoming and emerge
 

4869
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:52,310
physics start becoming and emerge
i really want to emphasize it's all

4870
01:23:52,310 --> 01:23:52,320
i really want to emphasize it's all
 

4871
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,149
i really want to emphasize it's all
super baby steps i don't want to over

4872
01:23:54,149 --> 01:23:54,159
super baby steps i don't want to over
 

4873
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:56,550
super baby steps i don't want to over
claim it's like it's i i think a lot of

4874
01:23:56,550 --> 01:23:56,560
claim it's like it's i i think a lot of
 

4875
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,149
claim it's like it's i i think a lot of
the things we're doing we're approaching

4876
01:23:58,149 --> 01:23:58,159
the things we're doing we're approaching
 

4877
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:00,149
the things we're doing we're approaching
some old problems in a in a pretty fresh

4878
01:24:00,149 --> 01:24:00,159
some old problems in a in a pretty fresh
 

4879
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:03,189
some old problems in a in a pretty fresh
way informed there's been a zillion

4880
01:24:03,189 --> 01:24:03,199
way informed there's been a zillion
 

4881
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:04,870
way informed there's been a zillion
papers about how you can think of the

4882
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:04,880
papers about how you can think of the
 

4883
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,550
papers about how you can think of the
universe as a big neural net or how you

4884
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:06,560
universe as a big neural net or how you
 

4885
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:09,189
universe as a big neural net or how you
can think of different ideas in physics

4886
01:24:09,189 --> 01:24:09,199
can think of different ideas in physics
 

4887
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:11,110
can think of different ideas in physics
as being quite similar to or even

4888
01:24:11,110 --> 01:24:11,120
as being quite similar to or even
 

4889
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:13,030
as being quite similar to or even
equivalent to some of the ideas in

4890
01:24:13,030 --> 01:24:13,040
equivalent to some of the ideas in
 

4891
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:15,350
equivalent to some of the ideas in
machine learning

4892
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:15,360
machine learning
 

4893
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,030
machine learning
and uh

4894
01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:17,040
and uh
 

4895
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,870
and uh
that actually works out crazy well like

4896
01:24:18,870 --> 01:24:18,880
that actually works out crazy well like
 

4897
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:21,030
that actually works out crazy well like
i mean it that is actually kind of eerie

4898
01:24:21,030 --> 01:24:21,040
i mean it that is actually kind of eerie
 

4899
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:22,950
i mean it that is actually kind of eerie
when you look at it like uh

4900
01:24:22,950 --> 01:24:22,960
when you look at it like uh
 

4901
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,790
when you look at it like uh
there's probably

4902
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:24,800
there's probably
 

4903
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,390
there's probably
two or three dozen papers that have this

4904
01:24:26,390 --> 01:24:26,400
two or three dozen papers that have this
 

4905
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,229
two or three dozen papers that have this
quality and some of them are just crazy

4906
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:28,239
quality and some of them are just crazy
 

4907
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:30,470
quality and some of them are just crazy
good and it's very it's very interesting

4908
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:30,480
good and it's very it's very interesting
 

4909
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,470
good and it's very it's very interesting
what we're trying to do is is

4910
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:32,480
what we're trying to do is is
 

4911
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,070
what we're trying to do is is
take those kinds of observations and

4912
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:34,080
take those kinds of observations and
 

4913
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,750
take those kinds of observations and
turn them into an actionable framework

4914
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:35,760
turn them into an actionable framework
 

4915
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:38,310
turn them into an actionable framework
where you can then start to

4916
01:24:38,310 --> 01:24:38,320
where you can then start to
 

4917
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,669
where you can then start to
do things with landscapes or theories

4918
01:24:39,669 --> 01:24:39,679
do things with landscapes or theories
 

4919
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:40,709
do things with landscapes or theories
that you couldn't do before and that

4920
01:24:40,709 --> 01:24:40,719
that you couldn't do before and that
 

4921
01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:42,470
that you couldn't do before and that
sort of thing

4922
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:42,480
sort of thing
 

4923
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:44,390
sort of thing
so in that context

4924
01:24:44,390 --> 01:24:44,400
so in that context
 

4925
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,950
so in that context
or maybe beyond uh how do you explain us

4926
01:24:46,950 --> 01:24:46,960
or maybe beyond uh how do you explain us
 

4927
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,510
or maybe beyond uh how do you explain us
humans how unlikely are we this

4928
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:49,520
humans how unlikely are we this
 

4929
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:52,470
humans how unlikely are we this
intelligent civilization or is there a

4930
01:24:52,470 --> 01:24:52,480
intelligent civilization or is there a
 

4931
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,390
intelligent civilization or is there a
lot of others or are we alone in this

4932
01:24:54,390 --> 01:24:54,400
lot of others or are we alone in this
 

4933
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:57,270
lot of others or are we alone in this
universe

4934
01:24:57,270 --> 01:24:57,280

 

4935
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,910

yeah

4936
01:24:59,910 --> 01:24:59,920

 

4937
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:03,270

you seem to appreciate humans very much

4938
01:25:03,270 --> 01:25:03,280
you seem to appreciate humans very much
 

4939
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:08,629
you seem to appreciate humans very much
i've grown fond of us

4940
01:25:08,629 --> 01:25:08,639

 

4941
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:11,990

um whatever there are nice qualities

4942
01:25:11,990 --> 01:25:12,000
um whatever there are nice qualities
 

4943
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:12,950
um whatever there are nice qualities
um

4944
01:25:12,950 --> 01:25:12,960
um
 

4945
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:15,270
um
and like i like that i mean we're kind

4946
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:15,280
and like i like that i mean we're kind
 

4947
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:17,350
and like i like that i mean we're kind
of weird we sprout this hair on our

4948
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:17,360
of weird we sprout this hair on our
 

4949
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,030
of weird we sprout this hair on our
heads and then i don't know we're sort

4950
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:19,040
heads and then i don't know we're sort
 

4951
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:21,110
heads and then i don't know we're sort
of weird animals that's the feature not

4952
01:25:21,110 --> 01:25:21,120
of weird animals that's the feature not
 

4953
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,390
of weird animals that's the feature not
a bug i think

4954
01:25:22,390 --> 01:25:22,400
a bug i think
 

4955
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:23,750
a bug i think
the weirdness

4956
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:23,760
the weirdness
 

4957
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,390
the weirdness
i hope so i hope so

4958
01:25:26,390 --> 01:25:26,400
i hope so i hope so
 

4959
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,070
i hope so i hope so
um

4960
01:25:28,070 --> 01:25:28,080
um
 

4961
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,709
um
i

4962
01:25:30,709 --> 01:25:30,719

 

4963
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:33,590

i think if i'm just going to answer you

4964
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:33,600
i think if i'm just going to answer you
 

4965
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,629
i think if i'm just going to answer you
in terms of um truth the first thing i'd

4966
01:25:36,629 --> 01:25:36,639
in terms of um truth the first thing i'd
 

4967
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:38,550
in terms of um truth the first thing i'd
say is we're not we're not

4968
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:38,560
say is we're not we're not
 

4969
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,709
say is we're not we're not
in a privileged enough position

4970
01:25:40,709 --> 01:25:40,719
in a privileged enough position
 

4971
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:43,270
in a privileged enough position
at least as yet to really know much

4972
01:25:43,270 --> 01:25:43,280
at least as yet to really know much
 

4973

by that so i shall remain a duelist but
 

5237
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,030
by that so i shall remain a duelist but

actual photons and with a good telescope
 

6071
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:50,229
actual photons and with a good telescope
it's really like this object like you

intervening information structure this
 

6079
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:57,189
intervening information structure this
is like the actual photons and it's

6080
01:45:57,189 --> 01:45:57,199
is like the actual photons and it's
 

6081
01:45:57,199 --> 01:45:59,510
is like the actual photons and it's
really a three-dimensional object

6082
01:45:59,510 --> 01:45:59,520
really a three-dimensional object
 

6083
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,270
really a three-dimensional object
and you have even a feeling for the

and you have even a feeling for the
vastness of it and um

6086
01:46:04,149 --> 01:46:04,159
vastness of it and um
 

6087
01:46:04,159 --> 01:46:05,669
vastness of it and um
it's it's

that we would not develop human
 

6149
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:15,590
that we would not develop human
civilization there's something about

6150
01:47:15,590 --> 01:47:15,600
civilization there's something about
 

6151
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:17,350
civilization there's something about
being able to look up

6152
01:47:17,350 --> 01:47:17,360
being able to look up
 

6153
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:19,109
being able to look up
and see a vast

6154
01:47:19,109 --> 01:47:19,119
and see a vast
 

6155
01:47:19,119 --> 01:47:21,430
and see a vast
universe is like that's fundamental to

6156

6167
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:32,709
old isaac asimov story where the cl you
know there's this planet where they

6168
01:47:32,709 --> 01:47:32,719
know there's this planet where they
 

6169
01:47:32,719 --> 01:47:34,229
know there's this planet where they
finally get to see what's in the sky

6170
01:47:34,229 --> 01:47:34,239
finally get to see what's in the sky
 

6171
01:47:34,239 --> 01:47:35,510
finally get to see what's in the sky
once in a while and it turns out they're

6172
01:47:35,510 --> 01:47:35,520
once in a while and it turns out they're
 

6173
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:36,870
once in a while and it turns out they're
in the middle of a globular cluster and

6174
01:47:36,870 --> 01:47:36,880
in the middle of a globular cluster and
 

6175
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:38,310
in the middle of a globular cluster and
they're always starting

6176

they're always starting
 

6177

it might be right i'm just thinking of
 

6187
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:50,790
it might be right i'm just thinking of
all the civilizations that grew up under

6188
01:47:50,790 --> 01:47:50,800
all the civilizations that grew up under
 

6189
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:52,950
all the civilizations that grew up under
clouds i mean like the

6190
01:47:52,950 --> 01:47:52,960
clouds i mean like the
 

6191
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:56,709

the vikings needed a special uh
 

6193
01:47:56,719 --> 01:47:58,550
the vikings needed a special uh
diffracting piece of mica to navigate

6194
01:47:58,550 --> 01:47:58,560
diffracting piece of mica to navigate
 

6195
01:47:58,560 --> 01:47:59,830
diffracting piece of mica to navigate
because they could never see the sun

6196
01:47:59,830 --> 01:47:59,840
because they could never see the sun
 

6197
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:01,189
because they could never see the sun
they had this thing called a sunstone

6198
01:48:01,189 --> 01:48:01,199
they had this thing called a sunstone
 

6199
01:48:01,199 --> 01:48:02,790
they had this thing called a sunstone
that they found from this this one cave

6200
01:48:02,790 --> 01:48:02,800
that they found from this this one cave
 

6201
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:04,629
that they found from this this one cave
do you know about that so they were in

6202
01:48:04,629 --> 01:48:04,639
do you know about that so they were in
 

6203
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:05,669
do you know about that so they were in
this like

6204
01:48:05,669 --> 01:48:05,679
this like
 

6205
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:08,470
this like
uh they were trying to navigate boats

6206
01:48:08,470 --> 01:48:08,480
uh they were trying to navigate boats
 

6207
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:10,470
uh they were trying to navigate boats
you know in the north atlantic with

6208
01:48:10,470 --> 01:48:10,480
you know in the north atlantic with
 

6209
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:11,590
you know in the north atlantic with
without being able to see the sun

without being able to see the sun
 

6211
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:13,669
without being able to see the sun
because it was cloudy and so they they

6212
01:48:13,669 --> 01:48:13,679
because it was cloudy and so they they
 

6213
01:48:13,679 --> 01:48:16,950
because it was cloudy and so they they
used uh a

6214

uh uh
 

6217
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:20,629
uh uh
chunk of mica to diffract it in order to

6218
01:48:20,629 --> 01:48:20,639
chunk of mica to diffract it in order to
 

6219
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:22,149
chunk of mica to diffract it in order to
be able to align where the sun really

6220
01:48:22,149 --> 01:48:22,159
be able to align where the sun really
 

6221
01:48:22,159 --> 01:48:23,590
be able to align where the sun really
was because they couldn't tell my eye

6222
01:48:23,590 --> 01:48:23,600
was because they couldn't tell my eye
 

6223
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:25,830
was because they couldn't tell my eye
and navigate so i'm just saying there

6224
01:48:25,830 --> 01:48:25,840
and navigate so i'm just saying there
 

6225
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:27,030
and navigate so i'm just saying there
are a lot of civilizations that are

6226
01:48:27,030 --> 01:48:27,040
are a lot of civilizations that are
 

6227
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:28,709
are a lot of civilizations that are
pretty impressive that have to deal with

6228
01:48:28,709 --> 01:48:28,719
pretty impressive that have to deal with
 

6229
01:48:28,719 --> 01:48:30,470
pretty impressive that have to deal with
a lot of clouds

6230
01:48:30,470 --> 01:48:30,480
a lot of clouds
 

6231
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:31,510
a lot of clouds
uh

6232

it makes me feel very small
 

6251
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:54,550
it makes me feel very small
that we're not small

6252
01:48:54,550 --> 01:48:54,560
that we're not small
 

6253
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:56,229
that we're not small
but then you ask

6254
01:48:56,229 --> 01:48:56,239
but then you ask
 

6255
01:48:56,239 --> 01:48:59,350
but then you ask
it it still feels that we're special

6256
01:48:59,350 --> 01:48:59,360
it it still feels that we're special
 

6257
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:01,590
it it still feels that we're special
and then the natural question is like

6258
01:49:01,590 --> 01:49:01,600
and then the natural question is like
 

6259
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:05,189
and then the natural question is like
well if we are special as i think we are

6260
01:49:05,189 --> 01:49:05,199
well if we are special as i think we are
 

6261
01:49:05,199 --> 01:49:06,950
well if we are special as i think we are
why the heck are we here

6262
01:49:06,950 --> 01:49:06,960
why the heck are we here
 

6263
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:09,910
why the heck are we here
in this vast universe

6264
01:49:09,910 --> 01:49:09,920
in this vast universe
 

6265
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:12,550
in this vast universe
that ultimately is the question of um

6266
01:49:12,550 --> 01:49:12,560
that ultimately is the question of um
 

6267
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:14,310
that ultimately is the question of um
right well the meaning of life i mean

6268
01:49:14,310 --> 01:49:14,320
right well the meaning of life i mean
 

6269
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:15,910
right well the meaning of life i mean
look

6270
01:49:15,910 --> 01:49:15,920
look
 

6271
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:19,830
look
there's a confusion sometimes in trying

6272
01:49:19,830 --> 01:49:19,840
there's a confusion sometimes in trying
 

6273
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:21,270
there's a confusion sometimes in trying
to use

6274
01:49:21,270 --> 01:49:21,280
to use
 

6275
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:22,790
to use
uh

6276
01:49:22,790 --> 01:49:22,800
uh
 

6277
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:24,790
uh
to set up a question

6278
01:49:24,790 --> 01:49:24,800
to set up a question
 

6279
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:26,709
to set up a question
or a thought experiment or something

6280
01:49:26,709 --> 01:49:26,719
or a thought experiment or something
 

6281
01:49:26,719 --> 01:49:29,830
or a thought experiment or something
that's defined in terms of a context to

6282
01:49:29,830 --> 01:49:29,840
that's defined in terms of a context to
 

6283
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:31,669
that's defined in terms of a context to
explain something where there is no

6284
01:49:31,669 --> 01:49:31,679
explain something where there is no
 

6285
01:49:31,679 --> 01:49:33,589
explain something where there is no
larger context and that's a category

6286
01:49:33,589 --> 01:49:33,599
larger context and that's a category
 

6287
01:49:33,599 --> 01:49:35,189
larger context and that's a category
error

6288
01:49:35,189 --> 01:49:35,199
error
 

6289
01:49:35,199 --> 01:49:38,070
error
if we want to do it in physics

6290
01:49:38,070 --> 01:49:38,080
if we want to do it in physics
 

6291
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:41,350
if we want to do it in physics
or well right in computer science

6292
01:49:41,350 --> 01:49:41,360
or well right in computer science
 

6293
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:43,030
or well right in computer science
it's hard to talk about the universe as

6294
01:49:43,030 --> 01:49:43,040
it's hard to talk about the universe as
 

6295
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:44,550
it's hard to talk about the universe as
a turing machine because a turing

6296
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:44,560
a turing machine because a turing
 

6297
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:46,629
a turing machine because a turing
machine has an external clock and an

6298
01:49:46,629 --> 01:49:46,639
machine has an external clock and an
 

6299
01:49:46,639 --> 01:49:48,950
machine has an external clock and an
observer and uh input and output there's

6300
01:49:48,950 --> 01:49:48,960
observer and uh input and output there's
 

6301
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:51,030
observer and uh input and output there's
a larger context implied in order for it

6302
01:49:51,030 --> 01:49:51,040
a larger context implied in order for it
 

6303
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:52,629
a larger context implied in order for it
to be defined at all

6304
01:49:52,629 --> 01:49:52,639
to be defined at all
 

6305
01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:53,589
to be defined at all
and so if you're talking about the

6306
01:49:53,589 --> 01:49:53,599
and so if you're talking about the
 

6307
01:49:53,599 --> 01:49:55,270
and so if you're talking about the
universe you can't talk about it

6308
01:49:55,270 --> 01:49:55,280
universe you can't talk about it
 

6309
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:57,189
universe you can't talk about it
coherently as a turing machine

6310
01:49:57,189 --> 01:49:57,199
coherently as a turing machine
 

6311
01:49:57,199 --> 01:49:58,629
coherently as a turing machine
quantum mechanics like that quantum

6312
01:49:58,629 --> 01:49:58,639
quantum mechanics like that quantum
 

6313
01:49:58,639 --> 01:50:01,030
quantum mechanics like that quantum
mechanics has an external clock and has

6314
01:50:01,030 --> 01:50:01,040
mechanics has an external clock and has
 

6315
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:03,030
mechanics has an external clock and has
some kind of external context depending

6316
01:50:03,030 --> 01:50:03,040
some kind of external context depending
 

6317
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:04,790
some kind of external context depending
on your interpretation

6318
01:50:04,790 --> 01:50:04,800
on your interpretation
 

6319
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:05,589
on your interpretation
um

6320
01:50:05,589 --> 01:50:05,599
um
 

6321
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:07,669
um
that's either you know the observer or

6322
01:50:07,669 --> 01:50:07,679
that's either you know the observer or
 

6323
01:50:07,679 --> 01:50:09,109
that's either you know the observer or
whatever

6324
01:50:09,109 --> 01:50:09,119
whatever
 

6325
01:50:09,119 --> 01:50:10,870
whatever
and there's a they're they're similar

6326
01:50:10,870 --> 01:50:10,880
and there's a they're they're similar
 

6327
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:13,109
and there's a they're they're similar
that way so maybe maybe turing machines

6328
01:50:13,109 --> 01:50:13,119
that way so maybe maybe turing machines
 

6329
01:50:13,119 --> 01:50:15,990
that way so maybe maybe turing machines
and quantum mechanics can be

6330
01:50:15,990 --> 01:50:16,000
and quantum mechanics can be
 

6331
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,430
and quantum mechanics can be
better friends or something because they

6332
01:50:17,430 --> 01:50:17,440
better friends or something because they
 

6333
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:19,030
better friends or something because they
have a similar setup but the thing is if

6334
01:50:19,030 --> 01:50:19,040
have a similar setup but the thing is if
 

6335
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:21,350
have a similar setup but the thing is if
you have something that's defined

6336
01:50:21,350 --> 01:50:21,360
you have something that's defined
 

6337
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:23,589
you have something that's defined
in terms of an outer context

6338
01:50:23,589 --> 01:50:23,599
in terms of an outer context
 

6339
01:50:23,599 --> 01:50:26,070
in terms of an outer context
you can't talk about ultimates with it

6340
01:50:26,070 --> 01:50:26,080
you can't talk about ultimates with it
 

6341
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:27,910
you can't talk about ultimates with it
because obviously it doesn't it's not

6342
01:50:27,910 --> 01:50:27,920
because obviously it doesn't it's not
 

6343
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:30,629
because obviously it doesn't it's not
suited for that so there's some ideas

6344
01:50:30,629 --> 01:50:30,639
suited for that so there's some ideas
 

6345
01:50:30,639 --> 01:50:32,310
suited for that so there's some ideas
that are their own context general

6346
01:50:32,310 --> 01:50:32,320
that are their own context general
 

6347
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:34,629
that are their own context general
relativity is its own context it's

6348
01:50:34,629 --> 01:50:34,639
relativity is its own context it's
 

6349
01:50:34,639 --> 01:50:36,629
relativity is its own context it's
different that's why it's hard to unify

6350
01:50:36,629 --> 01:50:36,639
different that's why it's hard to unify
 

6351
01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:38,629
different that's why it's hard to unify
and

6352
01:50:38,629 --> 01:50:38,639
and
 

6353
01:50:38,639 --> 01:50:40,390
and
i think the same thing is true when we

6354
01:50:40,390 --> 01:50:40,400
i think the same thing is true when we
 

6355
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:42,310
i think the same thing is true when we
talk about

6356
01:50:42,310 --> 01:50:42,320
talk about
 

6357
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:44,310
talk about
these types of questions like

6358
01:50:44,310 --> 01:50:44,320
these types of questions like
 

6359
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:45,270
these types of questions like
uh

6360
01:50:45,270 --> 01:50:45,280
uh
 

6361
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:46,470
uh
meaning

6362
01:50:46,470 --> 01:50:46,480
meaning
 

6363
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:49,910
meaning
is in a context and

6364
01:50:49,910 --> 01:50:49,920
is in a context and
 

6365
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:51,589
is in a context and
to talk about ultimate meaning is

6366
01:50:51,589 --> 01:50:51,599
to talk about ultimate meaning is
 

6367
01:50:51,599 --> 01:50:53,669
to talk about ultimate meaning is
therefore a category or it's not it's

6368
01:50:53,669 --> 01:50:53,679
therefore a category or it's not it's
 

6369
01:50:53,679 --> 01:50:55,430
therefore a category or it's not it's
not a

um
 

6373
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:59,270
um
it's not a resolvable way of thinking it

6374
01:50:59,270 --> 01:50:59,280
it's not a resolvable way of thinking it
 

6375
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:02,310
it's not a resolvable way of thinking it
might be a way of thinking that

6376
01:51:02,310 --> 01:51:02,320
might be a way of thinking that
 

6377
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:06,310
might be a way of thinking that
is experientially

6378
01:51:06,310 --> 01:51:06,320

 

6379
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:10,070

um or aesthetically valuable because

6380
01:51:10,070 --> 01:51:10,080
um or aesthetically valuable because
 

6381
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,669
um or aesthetically valuable because
it is

6382
01:51:11,669 --> 01:51:11,679
it is
 

6383
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:13,750
it is
awesome in the sense of you know

6384
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:13,760
awesome in the sense of you know
 

6385
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:15,990
awesome in the sense of you know
awe-inspiring um

6386
01:51:15,990 --> 01:51:16,000
awe-inspiring um
 

6387
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,229
awe-inspiring um
but to try to treat it analytically is

6388
01:51:18,229 --> 01:51:18,239
but to try to treat it analytically is
 

6389
01:51:18,239 --> 01:51:18,950
but to try to treat it analytically is
not

6390
01:51:18,950 --> 01:51:18,960
not
 

6391
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:21,430
not
sensible maybe that's what music and

6392
01:51:21,430 --> 01:51:21,440
sensible maybe that's what music and
 

6393
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:23,750
sensible maybe that's what music and
poetry are for yeah maybe i think so i

6394
01:51:23,750 --> 01:51:23,760
poetry are for yeah maybe i think so i
 

6395
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:26,310
poetry are for yeah maybe i think so i
think music actually does escape any

6396
01:51:26,310 --> 01:51:26,320
think music actually does escape any
 

6397
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:27,830

particular context that's how it feels

6398
01:51:27,830 --> 01:51:27,840
particular context that's how it feels
 

6399
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:29,189
particular context that's how it feels
to me but i'm not sure about that that's

6400
01:51:29,189 --> 01:51:29,199
to me but i'm not sure about that that's
 

6401
01:51:29,199 --> 01:51:31,270
to me but i'm not sure about that that's
once again crazy artists talking not

6402
01:51:31,270 --> 01:51:31,280
once again crazy artists talking not

6405
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:36,629

well you did uh you do both masterfully

6406
01:51:36,629 --> 01:51:36,639
well you did uh you do both masterfully
 

6407
01:51:36,639 --> 01:51:38,950
well you did uh you do both masterfully
uh jaren and like i said i'm a big fan

6408
01:51:38,950 --> 01:51:38,960
uh jaren and like i said i'm a big fan
 

6409
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:40,390
uh jaren and like i said i'm a big fan
of everything you've done of you as a

6410
01:51:40,390 --> 01:51:40,400
of everything you've done of you as a
 

6411
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:44,550
of everything you've done of you as a
human being um i appreciate the the fun

6412
