00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,870
you know we do a lot of that anyway this
is what we do in our daily work we are

336
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:00,880
is what we do in our daily work we are
 

337
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,830
is what we do in our daily work we are
putting

338
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:01,840
putting
 

339
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,710
putting
money

340
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:02,720
money
 

341
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,550
money
we are investing in research which is

342
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:04,560
we are investing in research which is
 

343
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,029
we are investing in research which is
highly risky the difference in that case

344
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
highly risky the difference in that case
 

345
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:07,909
highly risky the difference in that case
was

346
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
was
 

347
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,590
was
that within the risk at all we put it

348
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
that within the risk at all we put it
 

349
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,710
that within the risk at all we put it
all in

350
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:10,720
all in
 

351
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,469
all in
we put everything

352
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:12,479
we put everything
 

353
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,510
we put everything
in one go so that we don't lose time

354
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520
in one go so that we don't lose time
 

355
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,830
in one go so that we don't lose time
usually we'll spend 50 millions and then

356
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:17,840
usually we'll spend 50 millions and then
 

357
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,590
usually we'll spend 50 millions and then
if that goes well then we will spend

358
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:19,600
if that goes well then we will spend
 

359
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,270
if that goes well then we will spend
another 50 and then if it goes well then

360
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:21,280
another 50 and then if it goes well then
 

361
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,230
another 50 and then if it goes well then
100. here we put all together

362
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
100. here we put all together
 

363
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,909
100. here we put all together
a little bit more than 2 billion dollars

364
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:25,919
a little bit more than 2 billion dollars
 

365
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,430
a little bit more than 2 billion dollars
2.3

366
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,440
2.3
 

367
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,749
2.3
billion dollars and

368
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
billion dollars and
 

369
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,350
billion dollars and
it was a

370
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:31,360
it was a
 

371
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,590
it was a
significant decision

372
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:33,600
significant decision
 

373
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,029
significant decision
but it was a very easy decision to make

374
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:37,039
but it was a very easy decision to make
 

375
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,629
but it was a very easy decision to make
in the context of what we were living at

376
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639
in the context of what we were living at
 

377
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,670
in the context of what we were living at
that time

378
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:39,680
that time
 

379
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,150
that time
it was pandemic people were scared we

380
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,160
it was pandemic people were scared we
 

381
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,390
it was pandemic people were scared we
were scared we didn't know how tomorrow

382
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,400
were scared we didn't know how tomorrow
 

383
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,309
were scared we didn't know how tomorrow
looked like

384
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:46,319
looked like
 

385
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,110
looked like
we were living unprecedented situations

386
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,120
we were living unprecedented situations
 

387
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,990
we were living unprecedented situations
and

388
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,000
and
 

389
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,110
and
we knew

390
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,120
we knew
 

391
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,230
we knew
that we have capabilities that may help

392
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,240
that we have capabilities that may help
 

393
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,790
that we have capabilities that may help
so there was not a second question or

394
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
so there was not a second question or
 

395
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,029
so there was not a second question or
choice we go all in

396
00:06:59,029 --> 00:06:59,039
choice we go all in
 

397
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,749
choice we go all in
when you make decisions like that

398
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:01,759
when you make decisions like that
 

399
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,790
when you make decisions like that
you're the ceo of a company

400
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
you're the ceo of a company
 

401
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,990
you're the ceo of a company
that needs to make money

402
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,000
that needs to make money
 

403
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,309
that needs to make money
and that

404
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319
and that
 

405
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,710
and that
hopes to do a lot of good in the world

406
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,720
hopes to do a lot of good in the world
 

407
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,270
hopes to do a lot of good in the world
how much of both of those things are

408
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,280
how much of both of those things are
 

409
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,189
how much of both of those things are
part of the calculation

410
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:17,199
part of the calculation
 

411
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,029
part of the calculation
so when you said it was a obvious choice

412
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:21,039
so when you said it was a obvious choice
 

413
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,550
so when you said it was a obvious choice
um i think you've said a bunch of things

414
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:24,560
um i think you've said a bunch of things
 

415
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,790
um i think you've said a bunch of things
of the kind of saying we need to go all

416
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:26,800
of the kind of saying we need to go all
 

417
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,589
of the kind of saying we need to go all
in

418
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
in
 

419
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,189
in
instead of very boldly diving in

420
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199
instead of very boldly diving in
 

421
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,350
instead of very boldly diving in
how much was that that the world is

422
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,360

 

423
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,589

facing uncertainty and fear and

424
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:37,599
facing uncertainty and fear and
 

425
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:38,870
facing uncertainty and fear and
potentially

426
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:38,880
potentially
 

427
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,870
potentially
destructive pandemic in the early days

428
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880
destructive pandemic in the early days
 

429
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,150
destructive pandemic in the early days
just when you're seeing the full

430
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:42,160
just when you're seeing the full
 

431
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,909
just when you're seeing the full
uncertainty before us don't know how

432
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:43,919
uncertainty before us don't know how
 

433
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,990
uncertainty before us don't know how
it's going to unroll and how much of it

434
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,000
it's going to unroll and how much of it
 

435
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,430
it's going to unroll and how much of it
is

436
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:47,440
is
 

437
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,350
is
this may also be a good financial

438
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:49,360
this may also be a good financial
 

439
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,990
this may also be a good financial
decision to take this risk yeah i think

440
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,000
decision to take this risk yeah i think
 

441
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,990
decision to take this risk yeah i think
about it all the time and i know very

442
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,000
about it all the time and i know very
 

443
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,869
about it all the time and i know very
well

444
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
well
 

445
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,390
well
that if you focus too much on making

446
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:56,400
that if you focus too much on making
 

447
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,390
that if you focus too much on making
money you will never make

448
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:58,400
money you will never make
 

449
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,830
money you will never make
you should focus in what is the real

450
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:01,840
you should focus in what is the real
 

451
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,670
you should focus in what is the real
value driver and the real

452
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:03,680
value driver and the real
 

453
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,070
value driver and the real
value driver it is to

454
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,080
value driver it is to
 

455
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,830
value driver it is to
make breakthroughs that change patients

456
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:07,840
make breakthroughs that change patients
 

457
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,790
make breakthroughs that change patients
lives

458

lives
 

459
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,390
lives
if you don't do that you will never make

460
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:10,400
if you don't do that you will never make
 

461
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,270
if you don't do that you will never make

money
if you do that

464
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
if you do that
 

465
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,550
if you do that
don't worry things will fall into place

466
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:14,560
don't worry things will fall into place
 

467
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,390
don't worry things will fall into place
and also money will follow

468
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400
and also money will follow
 

469
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,469
and also money will follow
but the mentality of the company needs

470
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:18,479
but the mentality of the company needs
 

471
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,390
but the mentality of the company needs
to be how to help the pace and that's

472
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
to be how to help the pace and that's
 

473
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,189
to be how to help the pace and that's
what

474
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:21,199
what
 

475
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,869
what
the management was that the shareholders

476
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
the management was that the shareholders
 

477
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,950
the management was that the shareholders
want because that's the only way that we

478
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:24,960
want because that's the only way that we
 

479
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,830
want because that's the only way that we
can create value in this particular case

480
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:27,840
can create value in this particular case
 

481
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,749
can create value in this particular case
we're not thinking at all

482
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:29,759
we're not thinking at all
 

483
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,149
we're not thinking at all
about what are we going to

484
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:32,159
about what are we going to
 

485
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,990
about what are we going to
make when we sell it or if we not sell

486
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,000
make when we sell it or if we not sell

make when we sell it or if we not sell
it

488

it
 

489
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,829
it
because what we were focusing 100 was

490
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:37,839
because what we were focusing 100 was
 

491
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,149
because what we were focusing 100 was
how to bring a solution to the world

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,790
how the study needs to be conducted
and what exactly they need to see to

released for 75 years
and then

578
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:13,680
and then
 

579
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,590
and then
maybe the broader version of that

580
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:15,600
maybe the broader version of that
 

581
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,269
maybe the broader version of that

they are forcing
 

601
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,350
they are forcing

discussed
 

609
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,949
discussed
now to to go into specific details of

610

now to to go into specific details of
 

611
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,630
now to to go into specific details of
of some discussions i don't know what is

612
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:50,640
of some discussions i don't know what is

the reason that fda wants to take the

614
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:52,800
the reason that fda wants to take the
 

615
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,790
the reason that fda wants to take the
time and but i'm sure they have very

616
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:54,800
time and but i'm sure they have very
 

617
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,630
time and but i'm sure they have very
good reasons

618
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,640
good reasons
 

619
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,670
good reasons
well let me just say my side of it

620
00:10:59,670 --> 00:10:59,680
well let me just say my side of it
 

621
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,910
well let me just say my side of it
it doesn't look like a good reason it

622
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:01,920
it doesn't look like a good reason it
 

623
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,430
it doesn't look like a good reason it
looks like maybe it's because i come

624
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,440
looks like maybe it's because i come
 

625
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,910
looks like maybe it's because i come
from the soviet union now this is not

626
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:05,920
from the soviet union now this is not
 

627
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,550
from the soviet union now this is not
you saying this this is me saying this

628
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:08,560
you saying this this is me saying this
 

629
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,750
you saying this this is me saying this
um

630
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:09,760
um
 

631
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,750
um
is there seems to be a bureaucracy that

632
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760
is there seems to be a bureaucracy that
 

633
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,509
is there seems to be a bureaucracy that
gets in the way of transparency that's

634
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:13,519
gets in the way of transparency that's
 

635
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,350
gets in the way of transparency that's
always the challenge with government so

636
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:15,360
always the challenge with government so
 

637
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,509
always the challenge with government so
government is very good at setting rules

638
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:17,519
government is very good at setting rules
 

639
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,190
government is very good at setting rules
and making sure there's oversight over

640
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,200
and making sure there's oversight over
 

641
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,670
and making sure there's oversight over
companies and people and so on but they

642
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:21,680
companies and people and so on but they
 

643
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,470
companies and people and so on but they
create they slow things down which is a

644
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:24,480
create they slow things down which is a
 

645
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,230
create they slow things down which is a
feature and a bug

646
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,240
feature and a bug
 

647
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,310
feature and a bug
and in this case they slowed down so

648
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:28,320
and in this case they slowed down so
 

649
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,630
and in this case they slowed down so
much i think the reason they said it at

650
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:30,640
much i think the reason they said it at
 

651
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,550
much i think the reason they said it at
75 years is because

652
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:32,560
75 years is because
 

653
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,030
75 years is because
they set a rate of being able to only

654
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,040
they set a rate of being able to only
 

655
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,350
they set a rate of being able to only
review 500 pages of data a day or

656
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,360
review 500 pages of data a day or
 

657
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,430
review 500 pages of data a day or
something like that and that's a very

658
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,440
something like that and that's a very
 

659
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,750
something like that and that's a very
kind of bureaucratic thing where in

660
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:41,760
kind of bureaucratic thing where in
 

661
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,790
kind of bureaucratic thing where in
reality you could just show the data

662
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:44,800
reality you could just show the data
 

663
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,230
reality you could just show the data
and it's not like something is being

664
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,240
and it's not like something is being
 

665
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,509
and it's not like something is being

to inspire them with science it feels
 

671
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,509
to inspire them with science it feels
like transparency is one of the most

672

to me like a failure so in your
 

687
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,870
to me like a failure so in your
perspective you're saying i'm sure they

this black box
 

693
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,750
this black box
that you submit things to once they

you know that
 

699
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,430
you know that
those are the rules it's approved that's

those are the rules it's approved that's
 

701
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,710
those are the rules it's approved that's
it but this is not a black box we know

00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:24,720
it but this is not a black box we know
 

703
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,949
it but this is not a black box we know
very well what

704
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:26,959
very well what
 

705
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,269
very well what
is the process everybody knows very well

706
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279
is the process everybody knows very well
 

707
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,949
is the process everybody knows very well
what are the processes

708
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:30,959
what are the processes
 

709
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,150
what are the processes
the

710
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
the
 

711
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,629
the
review process also it is

712
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:34,639
review process also it is
 

713
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,629
review process also it is
very detailed they have scientists of

714
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:36,639
very detailed they have scientists of
 

715
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,030
very detailed they have scientists of
very very high caliber not every

716
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,040
very very high caliber not every
 

717
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,670
very very high caliber not every
regulator in the world but the europeans

718
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:41,680
regulator in the world but the europeans
 

719
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,550
regulator in the world but the europeans
the

720
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:42,560
the
 

721
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,949
the
the bridge the fda clearly

722
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:44,959
the bridge the fda clearly
 

723
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,629
the bridge the fda clearly
they have very very high caliber of

724
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:46,639
they have very very high caliber of
 

725
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,629
they have very very high caliber of
scientists that they are going into

726
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:48,639
scientists that they are going into
 

727
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,949
scientists that they are going into
a lot of details and

728
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:50,959
a lot of details and
 

729
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,629
a lot of details and
also

730
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:52,639
also
 

731
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,670
also
basically everything for a study is

732
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:55,680
basically everything for a study is
 

733
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,629
basically everything for a study is
really

734
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:56,639
really
 

735
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,030
really
released by law in the

00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,040
released by law in the
 

737
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,870
released by law in the
specifications of the product but it's a

738
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:00,880
specifications of the product but it's a
 

739
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,949
specifications of the product but it's a
very detailed document yeah but it is

740
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:02,959
very detailed document yeah but it is
 

741
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,269
very detailed document yeah but it is
issue and has basically the essence of

742
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
issue and has basically the essence of
 

743
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,069
issue and has basically the essence of
everything was discussed i don't know

744
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:08,079
everything was discussed i don't know
 

745
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,350
everything was discussed i don't know
about

746
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:09,360
about
 

747
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,670
about
specific documents if take them time to

748
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:11,680
specific documents if take them time to
 

749
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,750
specific documents if take them time to
release but clearly this is not a black

750
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:13,760
release but clearly this is not a black
 

751
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,790
release but clearly this is not a black
box

752
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:14,800
box
 

753
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,509
box
type of process a lot of this stuff is

754
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:17,519
type of process a lot of this stuff is
 

755
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,190
type of process a lot of this stuff is
how do you effectively communicate to

756
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,200
how do you effectively communicate to
 

757
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,470
how do you effectively communicate to
the world

758
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:20,480
the world
 

759
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,990
the world
about the incredible science that's been

760
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,000
about the incredible science that's been
 

761
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,590
about the incredible science that's been
done about the processes that were

762
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:23,600
done about the processes that were
 

763
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,829
done about the processes that were
followed and i agree with you and

764
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:25,839
followed and i agree with you and
 

765
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,230
followed and i agree with you and
sometimes it's just ineloquence in

766
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,240
sometimes it's just ineloquence in
 

767
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,230
sometimes it's just ineloquence in
communication it's not that there's a

768
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:30,240
communication it's not that there's a
 

769
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,069
communication it's not that there's a
failure process it's ineligible to

770
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:32,079
failure process it's ineligible to
 

771
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,949
failure process it's ineligible to
communication and silence silence in the

772
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:34,959
communication and silence silence in the
 

773
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,110
communication and silence silence in the
moment when clearly a lot of people are

774
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:37,120
moment when clearly a lot of people are
 

775
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,230
moment when clearly a lot of people are
bothered

776
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,240
bothered
 

777
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,990
bothered
and have questions

778
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,000
and have questions
 

779
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,310
and have questions
this is when you speak out and you

780
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:42,320
this is when you speak out and you
 

781
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,629
this is when you speak out and you
explain exactly why

782
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:44,639
explain exactly why
 

783
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,030
explain exactly why
as as opposed to letting the sort of

784
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,040
as as opposed to letting the sort of
 

785
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,870
as as opposed to letting the sort of
distrust build up

786
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:48,880
distrust build up
 

787
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,069
distrust build up
and linger

788
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:50,079
and linger
 

789
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,430
and linger
because the result is there's a very

790
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,440
because the result is there's a very
 

791
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,590
because the result is there's a very
large percentage of the population that

792
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:53,600
large percentage of the population that
 

793
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,870
large percentage of the population that
just

794
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:54,880
just
 

795
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,150
just
um

796
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,160
um
 

797
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,230
um
i mean it divides people

798
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:58,240
i mean it divides people
 

799
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,110
i mean it divides people
and science suffers i think

800
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:01,120
and science suffers i think
 

801
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,750
and science suffers i think
and also the effectiveness of solutions

802
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:03,760
and also the effectiveness of solutions
 

803
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,389
and also the effectiveness of solutions
suffers like the vaccine and so on

804
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:08,399

 

805
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,870

1330
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:33,679
and can you clarify so off-label are
 

1331
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,070
and can you clarify so off-label are
things that the fda didn't approve extra

1332
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,080
things that the fda didn't approve extra

stuff
 

1335
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,870
stuff
you basically say this drug does extra

1336
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:38,880
you basically say this drug does extra
 

1337
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,710
you basically say this drug does extra
stuff that the fda never approved

stuff that the fda never approved
 

1339
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,470
stuff that the fda never approved
correct and this is something that it is

1340
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:42,480
correct and this is something that it is
 

1341
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,789
correct and this is something that it is
allowed when physicians are speaking to

to settle in 2009 and we paid a very big

1364
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:03,760
to settle in 2009 and we paid a very big
 

1365
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,110
to settle in 2009 and we paid a very big
fine as you said

1366
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,120
fine as you said
 

1367
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,269
fine as you said
the fine was related not to

00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:07,279
the fine was related not to
 

1369
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,950
the fine was related not to
the severity of the contact but the size

1370
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:08,960
the severity of the contact but the size
 

1371
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,149
the severity of the contact but the size
of the revenues so this the fines are if

1372
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:12,159
of the revenues so this the fines are if
 

1373
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,669

a small fine vector was a very big

1376
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:15,200
a small fine vector was a very big
 

1377
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,590
a small fine vector was a very big
product and we got a very large fine

1378
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:17,600
product and we got a very large fine
 

1379
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,430
product and we got a very large fine
very bad what happened in 2003

1380
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:21,440
very bad what happened in 2003
 

1381
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,710
very bad what happened in 2003
i don't think that these things

1382
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:24,720
i don't think that these things
 

1383
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,269
i don't think that these things
happened since then we have a stellar

1384
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:27,279
happened since then we have a stellar
 

1385
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,990

1392
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:37,440
processes to make sure
 

1393
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,029
processes to make sure
that these are not happening by

1394
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:39,039
that these are not happening by
 

1395
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,830
that these are not happening by
individuals that may have an interest

1396
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:41,840
individuals that may have an interest
 

1397
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,149
individuals that may have an interest
for example to get a promotion they may

1398
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:44,159
for example to get a promotion they may
 

1399
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,070
for example to get a promotion they may
try and do things that they are not the

1400
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,080
try and do things that they are not the
 

1401
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,190
try and do things that they are not the
right things

1402
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:47,200
right things
 

1403
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,029
right things
and we have more importantly a culture

1404
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:51,039
and we have more importantly a culture
 

1405
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,549
and we have more importantly a culture
in this company

1406
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:52,559
in this company
 

1407
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,190
in this company
that really sets aside people that they

1408
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:55,200
that really sets aside people that they
 

1409
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,470
that really sets aside people that they
think differently

1410
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:56,480
think differently
 

1411
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,990
think differently
so i

1412
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,000
so i
 

1413
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,669
so i
didn't like what happened in 2003

1414
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:01,679
didn't like what happened in 2003
 

1415
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,990
didn't like what happened in 2003
but i believe a lot has changed in the

1416
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:04,000
but i believe a lot has changed in the
 

1417
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,750
but i believe a lot has changed in the
20 years that followed

1418
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:05,760
20 years that followed
 

1419
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,669
20 years that followed
almost 20 years

1420
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:07,679
almost 20 years
 

1421
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,669
almost 20 years
so you're developing drugs you're

1422
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:09,679
so you're developing drugs you're
 

1423
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,750
so you're developing drugs you're
developing solutions to help millions of

1424
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:11,760
developing solutions to help millions of
 

1425
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,789
developing solutions to help millions of
people but there's risk involved

1426
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:14,799
people but there's risk involved
 

1427
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,149
people but there's risk involved
and so

1428
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:16,159
and so
 

1429
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,470
and so
there will be lawsuits heading back your

1430
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:18,480
there will be lawsuits heading back your
 

1431
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,390
there will be lawsuits heading back your
way

1432
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:20,400
way
 

1433
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,830
way
because there's a lot of lawyers in the

1434
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:21,840
because there's a lot of lawyers in the
 

1435
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,190
because there's a lot of lawyers in the
world

1436
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:23,200
world
 

1437
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,430
world
partially

1438
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:27,440

 

1439
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,830

how do you put that into the calculation

1440
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:29,840
how do you put that into the calculation
 

1441
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,149
how do you put that into the calculation
of of how you tried to do good in the

1442
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:32,159
of of how you tried to do good in the
 

1443
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,310
of of how you tried to do good in the
world

1444
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:34,320
world
 

1445
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,590
world
um

1446
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:35,600
um
 

1447
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,149
um
that some of the causes the lawsuits

1448
00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:38,159
that some of the causes the lawsuits
 

1449
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,070
that some of the causes the lawsuits
how do you uh

1450
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:40,080
how do you uh
 

1451
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,390
how do you uh
not fall victim to thinking that it's

1452
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:42,400
not fall victim to thinking that it's
 

1453
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,950
not fall victim to thinking that it's
just the cost of doing business and then

1454
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:44,960
just the cost of doing business and then
 

1455
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,310
just the cost of doing business and then
some of the losses might actually

1456
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:46,320
some of the losses might actually
 

1457
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,310
some of the losses might actually
represent real pain that people are

1458
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:48,320
represent real pain that people are
 

1459
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,590
represent real pain that people are
going through

1460
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:49,600
going through
 

1461
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,510
going through
you know i i think that we try always to

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,909
different reasons
yeah i know but it's still it's pressure

1656
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:19,919
yeah i know but it's still it's pressure
 

1657
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,230
yeah i know but it's still it's pressure
it's human nature i mean i i if it's one

1658
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:22,240
it's human nature i mean i i if it's one
 

1659
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,230
it's human nature i mean i i if it's one
of those perception but i i worry about

1660
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:24,240
of those perception but i i worry about
 

1661
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,909
of those perception but i i worry about
you i think i have a ton of sponsors for

1662
00:29:25,909 --> 00:29:25,919
you i think i have a ton of sponsors for
 

1663
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,830
you i think i have a ton of sponsors for
this podcast for example and none of

1664
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:27,840
this podcast for example and none of
 

1665
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,430
this podcast for example and none of
them ever asked me to

1666
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:29,440
them ever asked me to
 

1667
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,750
them ever asked me to
anything they're just you know

1668
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:31,760
anything they're just you know
 

1669
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,029
anything they're just you know
i think

1670
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:33,039
i think
 

1671
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,389
i think
likely that kind of pressure is not

1672
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:34,399
likely that kind of pressure is not
 

1673
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,310
likely that kind of pressure is not
happening for pfizer

1674
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:36,320
happening for pfizer
 

1675
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,269
happening for pfizer
but there's implied pressure sometimes

1676
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:39,279
but there's implied pressure sometimes
 

1677
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,590
but there's implied pressure sometimes
and i worry about that a lot

1678
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:41,600
and i worry about that a lot
 

1679
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,430
and i worry about that a lot
because um you know i look at academia

1680
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:45,440
because um you know i look at academia
 

1681
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,310
because um you know i look at academia
like i i look for the good in people i

1682
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:48,320
like i i look for the good in people i
 

1683
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,590
like i i look for the good in people i
tend to believe most people are good or

1684
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:51,600
tend to believe most people are good or
 

1685
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,510
tend to believe most people are good or
have the capacity to be good and desire

1686
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:53,520
have the capacity to be good and desire
 

1687
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,870
have the capacity to be good and desire
to be good

1688
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:54,880
to be good
 

1689
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,750
to be good
when i came to mit i

1690
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:57,760
when i came to mit i
 

1691
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,950
when i came to mit i
i was a little bit

1692
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:00,960

 

1693
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,750

disappointed maybe heartbroken

1694
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:05,760

 

1695
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,669

how much pressure

1696
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:09,679

 

1697
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,630

i think unjustified pressure people felt

1698
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:12,640
i think unjustified pressure people felt
 

1699
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,029
i think unjustified pressure people felt
from financial constraints

1700
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:15,039
from financial constraints
 

1701
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,789
from financial constraints
especially at mit when there's i think a

1702
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:16,799
especially at mit when there's i think a
 

1703
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,110
especially at mit when there's i think a
lot of money

1704
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:19,120
lot of money
 

1705
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,269
lot of money
people still felt constraints

1706
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:21,279
people still felt constraints
 

1707
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,549
people still felt constraints
and they weren't

it wasn't bringing out the best in them

1710
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:24,320
it wasn't bringing out the best in them
 

1711
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,669
it wasn't bringing out the best in them
they weren't supporting each other they

1712
00:30:25,669 --> 00:30:25,679
they weren't supporting each other they
 

1713
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,510
they weren't supporting each other they
weren't loving each other like

celebrating each other's successes
 

1717
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,510
celebrating each other's successes

00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,630
could you tell me the story from the
engineering

1818
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:16,640
engineering
 

1819
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,669
engineering
to the science to the human story of how

1820
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:19,679
to the science to the human story of how
 

1821
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,630
to the science to the human story of how
you could do it so fast

1822
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:22,640
you could do it so fast
 

1823
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,029
you could do it so fast
by november you even had the ambition to

1824
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:25,039
by november you even had the ambition to
 

1825
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,190
by november you even had the ambition to
do it by october it was in the initial

1826
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:27,200
do it by october it was in the initial
 

1827
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,470
do it by october it was in the initial
days

1828
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:28,480
days
 

1829
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,029
days
how do you eight days later

1830
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:31,039
how do you eight days later
 

1831
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,549
how do you eight days later
in that time

1832
00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:32,559
in that time
 

1833
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,630
in that time
how do you show that the vaccine is safe

1834
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:34,640
how do you show that the vaccine is safe
 

1835
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,230
how do you show that the vaccine is safe
and effective

1836
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:36,240
and effective
 

1837
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,710
and effective
uh given that i think previous vaccines

1838
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:38,720
uh given that i think previous vaccines
 

1839
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,430
uh given that i think previous vaccines
have taken years to do that yeah

1840
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:41,440
have taken years to do that yeah
 

1841
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,269
have taken years to do that yeah
the vaccines take years to do that and

1842
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:43,279
the vaccines take years to do that and
 

1843
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,590
the vaccines take years to do that and
the the time

1844
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:45,600
the the time
 

1845
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,710
the the time
that it takes it is basically

1846
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:48,720
that it takes it is basically
 

1847
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,950
that it takes it is basically
the vast majority the time to conduct

1848
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:50,960
the vast majority the time to conduct
 

1849
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,149
the vast majority the time to conduct
the final

1850
00:32:52,149 --> 00:32:52,159
the final
 

1851
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,149
the final
phase 3 study that is the confirmatory

1852
00:32:54,149 --> 00:32:54,159
phase 3 study that is the confirmatory
 

1853
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,269
phase 3 study that is the confirmatory
study

1854
00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:55,279
study
 

1855
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,630
study
and you do that because the phase 3

1856
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:56,640
and you do that because the phase 3
 

1857
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,310
and you do that because the phase 3
study cost a lot of money in our case

1858
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:58,320
study cost a lot of money in our case
 

1859
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,630
study cost a lot of money in our case
cost almost a billion

1860
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:00,640
cost almost a billion
 

1861
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,190
cost almost a billion
so you don't want to go and risk a

1862
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:03,200
so you don't want to go and risk a
 

1863
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,070
so you don't want to go and risk a
billion in blind data normally before

1864
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:06,080
billion in blind data normally before
 

1865
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,110
billion in blind data normally before
you do a lot of experiments to make sure

1866
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:09,120
you do a lot of experiments to make sure
 

1867
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,870
you do a lot of experiments to make sure
that the product that you're putting in

1868
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:10,880
that the product that you're putting in
 

1869
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,430
that the product that you're putting in
the phase 3 is the right one

1870
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:13,440
the phase 3 is the right one
 

1871
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,029
the phase 3 is the right one
we didn't have the time

1872
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:15,039
we didn't have the time
 

1873
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:19,269
we didn't have the time
so we risked all the money so we went

1874
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:19,279
so we risked all the money so we went
 

1875
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,070
so we risked all the money so we went
into we condensed all the time towards

1876
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:22,080
into we condensed all the time towards
 

1877
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,070
into we condensed all the time towards
this phase three but the phase three

1878
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:24,080
this phase three but the phase three
 

1879
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,350
this phase three but the phase three
study had to follow all the rules that

1880
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:27,360
study had to follow all the rules that
 

1881
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,029
study had to follow all the rules that
any study

1882
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:29,039
any study
 

1883
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,070

follows
when you do this trial could you just

1886
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:32,080
when you do this trial could you just
 

1887
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,509
when you do this trial could you just
briefly

1888
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:33,519
briefly
 

1889
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,830
briefly
describe the basics of what is phase one

1890
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:35,840
describe the basics of what is phase one
 

1891
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,750
describe the basics of what is phase one
what is phase two what is phase three

1892
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:37,760
what is phase two what is phase three
 

1893
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,750
what is phase two what is phase three
let's say that there are so many phases

1894
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:39,760
let's say that there are so many phases
 

1895
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,549
let's say that there are so many phases
when you try first of all to find what

1896
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:42,559
when you try first of all to find what
 

1897
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,950
when you try first of all to find what
is the right vaccine we tried from 20

1898
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:44,960
is the right vaccine we tried from 20
 

1899
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,789
is the right vaccine we tried from 20
different vaccines we nailed down to

1900
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:46,799
different vaccines we nailed down to
 

1901
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:47,590
different vaccines we nailed down to
four

four
 

1903
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,509
four
and for those four we selected

1904
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:49,519
and for those four we selected
 

1905
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,310
and for those four we selected
eventually two and then eventually one

00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:53,679
once you have
 

1909
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,310
once you have
those selections what is the dose you're

00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:56,320
those selections what is the dose you're
 

1911
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,549
those selections what is the dose you're
going to use and then we tried multiple

1912
00:33:58,549 --> 00:33:58,559
going to use and then we tried multiple
 

1913
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,350
going to use and then we tried multiple
different doses to see which one we

1914
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:01,360
different doses to see which one we
 

1915
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,350
different doses to see which one we
think is the best what does trying

are giving them at the same time you
 

1945
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,389
are giving them at the same time you
start to measure what is doing in terms

of
 

1949
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,190
of
immune responses so you do that with

1950
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:35,200
immune responses so you do that with
 

1951
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,790
immune responses so you do that with
multiple vaccines and you do that with

1952
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:36,800
multiple vaccines and you do that with
 

1953
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,790
multiple vaccines and you do that with
multiple doses and you do that with

multiple doses and you do that with
 

1955
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,190

from the 20 vaccines to multiple doses
 

1963
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,190
from the 20 vaccines to multiple doses
to multiple schedules is it after

1964
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:49,200
to multiple schedules is it after
 

1965
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,109
to multiple schedules is it after
three weeks the second dose or is it

1966
00:34:51,109 --> 00:34:51,119
three weeks the second dose or is it
 

1967
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,750

after four weeks or after six months
 

1969
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,109
after four weeks or after six months
all of that will inform you

1970
00:34:57,109 --> 00:34:57,119
all of that will inform you
 

1971
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,990
all of that will inform you
that i think this is the vaccine this is

1972
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:00,000
that i think this is the vaccine this is
 

1973
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,710
that i think this is the vaccine this is
the dose this is the scheme that i

the dose this is the scheme that i
 

1975
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,829

believe
 

1977
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,750
believe
will give me the best results and when

1978
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:05,760

1979
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,750
will give me the best results and when
you have that then you go to do what we

you have that then you go to do what we
 

1981

you have that then you go to do what we
call the phase three

going with the right one that's why it
 

2033
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,109
going with the right one that's why it

that will give the two and then you let
 

2043
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,270
that will give the two and then you let
them live their lives and then you see

them live their lives and then you see
 

2045
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,270

for the fisa vaccine is it something you

2832

for the fisa vaccine is it something you
 

2833
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,030
for the fisa vaccine is it something you
see that's taking uh a booster shot

2834
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:13,040
see that's taking uh a booster shot
 

2835
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,950
see that's taking uh a booster shot
regularly like annually

regularly like annually
 

2837

regularly like annually
yes in the beginning when we had the

2838
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:16,640
yes in the beginning when we had the
 

2839
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,349
yes in the beginning when we had the
first months of the vaccine people would

2840
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:19,359
first months of the vaccine people would
 

2841
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,349
first months of the vaccine people would
ask me do we need another one and i said

2842
00:50:21,349 --> 00:50:21,359
ask me do we need another one and i said
 

2843
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,150
ask me do we need another one and i said
we don't know i was very clear about it

2844
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:24,160
we don't know i was very clear about it
 

2845
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,069
we don't know i was very clear about it
then around april may i started seeing

2846
00:50:26,069 --> 00:50:26,079
then around april may i started seeing
 

2847
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:28,870
then around april may i started seeing
the first data and i made statements

2848
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:28,880
the first data and i made statements
 

2849
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,750
the first data and i made statements
that i think we will need a booster

2850
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:31,760
that i think we will need a booster
 

2851
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,069
that i think we will need a booster
around 8 to 12 months after the second

00:50:34,069 --> 00:50:34,079
around 8 to 12 months after the second
 

2853
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:36,390
around 8 to 12 months after the second
dose and then after that annual

2854
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:36,400
dose and then after that annual
 

2855
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,870
dose and then after that annual
revaccinations this is what i said

2856
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:38,880
revaccinations this is what i said
 

2857
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,710
revaccinations this is what i said
believe is the one of the most likely

2858
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:40,720
believe is the one of the most likely
 

2859
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,309
believe is the one of the most likely
scenarios

2860
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:42,319
scenarios
 

2861
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:44,230
scenarios
and it was based on the data that i had

2862
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:44,240
and it was based on the data that i had
 

2863
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,990
and it was based on the data that i had
but then delta came

2864
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:46,000
but then delta came
 

2865
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,150
but then delta came
and because i always making the

the caveat that with

the caveat that with
 

2869
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,990
the caveat that with
absent and uvaria with everything we

2870
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:52,000
absent and uvaria with everything we
 

2871
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:52,710
absent and uvaria with everything we
know

00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:52,720
know
 

2873
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,870
know
with delta it was proven that we need

2874
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:54,880
with delta it was proven that we need
 

2875
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,950
with delta it was proven that we need
the booster to move to the three to the

2876
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:56,960
the booster to move to the three to the
 

2877
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,589
the booster to move to the three to the
six months and this is what

2878
00:50:59,589 --> 00:50:59,599
six months and this is what
 

2879
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:00,549
six months and this is what
happened

2880
00:51:00,549 --> 00:51:00,559
happened
 

2881
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:01,589
happened
and uh

2882
00:51:01,589 --> 00:51:01,599
and uh
 

2883
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,670
and uh
i still said i think

2884
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:03,680
i still said i think
 

2885
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,670
i still said i think
the booster is six months and then i

2886
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:05,680
the booster is six months and then i
 

2887
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,109
the booster is six months and then i
think it will be an annual

2888
00:51:07,109 --> 00:51:07,119
think it will be an annual
 

2889
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:09,589
think it will be an annual
re-vaccination likely we have to monitor

2890
00:51:09,589 --> 00:51:09,599
re-vaccination likely we have to monitor
 

2891
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,510
re-vaccination likely we have to monitor
to see the data but this is the likely

2892
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:11,520
to see the data but this is the likely
 

2893
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,710
to see the data but this is the likely
scenario

2894
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:12,720
scenario
 

2895
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,950
scenario
now we have omega

2896
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:14,960
now we have omega
 

2897
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,270
now we have omega
and omegran says that the

2898
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:17,280
and omegran says that the
 

2899
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,190
and omegran says that the
two doses might be challenging we don't

2900
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:19,200
two doses might be challenging we don't
 

2901
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,630
two doses might be challenging we don't
know exactly yet but three doses work

2902
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:22,640
know exactly yet but three doses work
 

2903
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,870
know exactly yet but three doses work
so clearly a lot of countries already

2904
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:24,880
so clearly a lot of countries already
 

2905
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,349
so clearly a lot of countries already
started moving now the third dose

2906
00:51:27,349 --> 00:51:27,359
started moving now the third dose
 

2907
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,670
started moving now the third dose
not in six from six months to three

2908
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:29,680
not in six from six months to three
 

2909
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,510
not in six from six months to three
so that they will

2910
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:31,520
so that they will
 

2911
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,150
so that they will
reduce the period that people will not

2912
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:34,160
reduce the period that people will not
 

2913
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:34,950
reduce the period that people will not
be

2914
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:34,960
be

protected with uh with
 

2917
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,670
protected with uh with
the third dose

2918
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:39,680
the third dose
 

2919
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,190
the third dose
i don't know with omikron if how long

2920
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:43,200
i don't know with omikron if how long
 

2921
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,270
i don't know with omikron if how long
this will last and frankly i don't know

2922
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:45,280
this will last and frankly i don't know
 

2923
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,670
this will last and frankly i don't know
if we will need a new vaccine taylormade

2924
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:47,680
if we will need a new vaccine taylormade
 

2925
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,750
if we will need a new vaccine taylormade
to omicron based on everything we know

so far
 

2929
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,109
so far
we are monitoring and to know way more

2930
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:53,119
we are monitoring and to know way more
 

2931
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:54,549
we are monitoring and to know way more
in the weeks to come

in the weeks to come
 

2933
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,630
in the weeks to come
if there is a need for a new vaccine we

2934
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:56,640
if there is a need for a new vaccine we
 

2935
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,069
if there is a need for a new vaccine we
will have it

2936
00:51:58,069 --> 00:51:58,079
will have it
 

2937
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,670
will have it
and if there is a need for mass

2938
00:51:59,670 --> 00:51:59,680
and if there is a need for mass
 

2939
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,309
and if there is a need for mass
production of this new vaccine

2940
00:52:02,309 --> 00:52:02,319
production of this new vaccine
 

2941
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,470
production of this new vaccine
i can also feel very comfortable that we

2942
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:04,480
i can also feel very comfortable that we
 

2943
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,630
i can also feel very comfortable that we
will not lose any of our capacity that

2944
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:06,640
will not lose any of our capacity that
 

2945
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,470
will not lose any of our capacity that
we have developed right now we are

00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,349
we have developed right now we are
running

2948
00:52:09,349 --> 00:52:09,359
running
 

2949
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,470
running
at one billion almost approximately

2950
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:12,480

00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:17,520
and if we have to switch
 

2957
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,349

and have half of that in the new half of

of convincing people to get vaccinated

3132
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:18,559
of convincing people to get vaccinated
 

3133
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:21,349
of convincing people to get vaccinated
to choose to get vaccinated if they want

3134

people should understand the science
and want to get vaccinated

3144
00:55:38,309 --> 00:55:38,319

vaccine not of the disease which are
 

3225
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,270
vaccine not of the disease which are
smaller number

smaller number
 

3227
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,150

themselves
so it's going to be this situation and

3240
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:07,040
so it's going to be this situation and
 

3241
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,710

3253
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,430
do you think about that calculation
because the risk for kids is very low

3254

fewer number than those that they're

but everybody's getting the vaccine

it's um well polio was deadlier for kids

it's um well polio was deadlier for kids
 

3301
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,910
it's um well polio was deadlier for kids
but it's not now so why some a kid to do

00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:19,920
but it's not now so why some a kid to do
 

3303

it
 

3305
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:24,150
it
now because needs to be protected well

00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,230
the unique thing about the covet vaccine
is a new type of technology too so

is a new type of technology too so
 

3311

how does that work
 

3369
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,510
how does that work
um and how are you able to develop

um and how are you able to develop
 

3371
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,270
um and how are you able to develop
in four months

first of all what this is about this is

first of all what this is about this is
 

3379
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,829
first of all what this is about this is
a real game changer

3380
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:41,839
a real game changer
 

3381
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:44,309
a real game changer
this is a course of treatment that you

3382
00:59:44,309 --> 00:59:44,319
this is a course of treatment that you
 

3383
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:46,470
this is a course of treatment that you
get only if you get the disease you get

3384
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:46,480
get only if you get the disease you get
 

3385
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,150
get only if you get the disease you get
covered

covered
 

3387

then what happens is that you will take

00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:50,720
then what happens is that you will take
 

3389
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,910
then what happens is that you will take
for five days pills day and night

3390
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:53,920
for five days pills day and night
 

3391

3393
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,230
and twice a day for five days
and instead of ten people from those

3394
00:59:58,230 --> 00:59:58,240
and instead of ten people from those
 

3395
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,789

that dies is to go to hospital only one

that kind of
question

3600
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:31,760
question
 

3601
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,190
question
all the effectiveness i've ever met and

3602
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:33,200
all the effectiveness i've ever met and
 

3603
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,430
all the effectiveness i've ever met and
definitely um something to think about

3604
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:35,440
definitely um something to think about
 

3605
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,190
definitely um something to think about
and i think it's the reason that

3606
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:37,200
and i think it's the reason that
 

3607
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,150
and i think it's the reason that
pakistan was chloroquinol before yes

3608
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:40,160
pakistan was chloroquinol before yes
 

3609
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,390
pakistan was chloroquinol before yes
for god's sake that's why how many

3610
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:42,400
for god's sake that's why how many
