you know various pieces of that mission
 

203
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,250
you know various pieces of that mission
as well so that's what I grew up on is

204
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:28,260
as well so that's what I grew up on is
 

205
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,260
as well so that's what I grew up on is
these planetary missions the start of

these planetary missions the start of
 

207
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,620
these planetary missions the start of
the Space Shuttle era and ultimately had

the Space Shuttle era and ultimately had
 

209
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,780
the Space Shuttle era and ultimately had
the opportunity to see Lockheed Martin's

the opportunity to see Lockheed Martin's
 

211
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,280
the opportunity to see Lockheed Martin's
part and we can maybe talk about some of

00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:40,290
part and we can maybe talk about some of
 

213
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,200
part and we can maybe talk about some of
these here but Lockheed Martin's part in

all of these space journeys over the
 

217
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,610
all of these space journeys over the
years do you dream and I apologize for

my own opportunity to fly into space but
 

237
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,730
my own opportunity to fly into space but
but as you know from the Lockheed Martin

238
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:13,740
but as you know from the Lockheed Martin
 

239
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,380
but as you know from the Lockheed Martin
perspective this is something that we're

240
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:15,390
perspective this is something that we're
 

241
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,720
perspective this is something that we're
working towards every day and of course

242
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:17,730
working towards every day and of course
 

243
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,130
working towards every day and of course
you know we're we're building the Orion

you know we're we're building the Orion
 

245
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,690
you know we're we're building the Orion
spacecraft which is the most

246
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:20,700
spacecraft which is the most
 

247
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,550
spacecraft which is the most
sophisticated human-rated spacecraft

248
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
sophisticated human-rated spacecraft
 

249
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,860
sophisticated human-rated spacecraft
ever built and it's really designed for

250
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:24,870
ever built and it's really designed for
 

251
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,960
ever built and it's really designed for
these deep-space journeys you know

252
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:26,970
these deep-space journeys you know
 

253
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,670
these deep-space journeys you know
starting with the moon but ultimately

254
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:28,680
starting with the moon but ultimately
 

255
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,870
starting with the moon but ultimately
going to Mars and being the platform you

256
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:32,880
going to Mars and being the platform you
 

257
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,030
going to Mars and being the platform you
know from a design perspective we call

258
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:35,040
know from a design perspective we call
 

259
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,920
know from a design perspective we call
the Mars base camp to be able to take

260
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:36,930
the Mars base camp to be able to take
 

261
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,830
the Mars base camp to be able to take
humans to the surface and then after a

262
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:39,840
humans to the surface and then after a
 

263
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,270
humans to the surface and then after a
mission of a couple of weeks bring him

264
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:41,280
mission of a couple of weeks bring him
 

265
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,830
mission of a couple of weeks bring him
back up safely and so that is something

266
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:42,840
back up safely and so that is something
 

267
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,620
back up safely and so that is something
I want to see happen during my time at

268
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:45,630
I want to see happen during my time at
 

269
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,930
I want to see happen during my time at
Lockheed Martin so I'm pretty excited

270
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:47,940
Lockheed Martin so I'm pretty excited
 

271
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:48,680
Lockheed Martin so I'm pretty excited
about that

272
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:48,690
about that
 

273
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,230
about that
and I think you know once we prove

274
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:51,240
and I think you know once we prove
 

275
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,040
and I think you know once we prove
that's possible you know colonization

276
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,050
that's possible you know colonization
 

277
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,290
that's possible you know colonization
might be a little bit further out but

278
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:57,300
might be a little bit further out but
 

279
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,170
might be a little bit further out but
it's something that I'd hoped to see so

280
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:00,180
it's something that I'd hoped to see so
 

281
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,150
it's something that I'd hoped to see so
maybe you can give a little bit an

282
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,160
maybe you can give a little bit an
 

283
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,970
maybe you can give a little bit an
overview of the Lockheed Martin's

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:17,370
what's lakis mission timeline and
 

295
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,129

long-term dream in terms of space
 

297
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:22,670
long-term dream in terms of space
you mentioned the moon I've heard you

298
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:22,680
you mentioned the moon I've heard you
 

299
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,779
you mentioned the moon I've heard you
talk about asteroids as Mars what's the

305
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,089
what's the engineering challenges and
what's the dream long term yeah I think

306
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:32,099
what's the dream long term yeah I think
 

307
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:33,709
what's the dream long term yeah I think
the dream long term is to have a

308
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:33,719
the dream long term is to have a
 

309
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:36,529
the dream long term is to have a
permanent presence in space beyond

310
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:36,539
permanent presence in space beyond
 

311
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,659
permanent presence in space beyond
low-earth orbit ultimately with a

312
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:38,669
low-earth orbit ultimately with a
 

313
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:41,420
low-earth orbit ultimately with a
long-term presence on the moon and then

314
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:41,430
long-term presence on the moon and then
 

315
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,689
long-term presence on the moon and then
to the planets to Mars and rage

316
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:44,699
to the planets to Mars and rage
 

317
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,249
to the planets to Mars and rage
interrupt and that's a long term

318
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:46,259
interrupt and that's a long term
 

319
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:49,580
interrupt and that's a long term
presence means sustained and sustainable

320
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:49,590

321
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,980
presence means sustained and sustainable
presence and an economy a space economy

322
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:51,990
presence and an economy a space economy
 

323
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,890
presence and an economy a space economy
that really goes alongside with human

324
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:54,900
that really goes alongside with human
 

325
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,080
that really goes alongside with human
beings being and being able to launch

326
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,090
beings being and being able to launch
 

327
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:02,629
beings being and being able to launch
perhaps from those so like hop you know

328
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
perhaps from those so like hop you know
 

329
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,920
perhaps from those so like hop you know
it says that there's a lot of energy

330
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:03,930
it says that there's a lot of energy
 

331
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,519
it says that there's a lot of energy
that goes in those hops right so I think

332
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:07,529
that goes in those hops right so I think
 

333
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:09,439
that goes in those hops right so I think
the first step is being able to get

334
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:09,449
the first step is being able to get
 

335
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:10,600
the first step is being able to get
there and to be able to establish

336
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:10,610
there and to be able to establish
 

337
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,820
there and to be able to establish
sustained basis right and and build from

338
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:13,830
sustained basis right and and build from
 

339
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:18,469
sustained basis right and and build from
there and a lot of that means getting as

340
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:18,479
there and a lot of that means getting as
 

341
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,899
there and a lot of that means getting as
you know things like the cost of launch

342
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:20,909
you know things like the cost of launch
 

343
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:22,969
you know things like the cost of launch
down and you mentioned United Launch

344
00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:22,979
down and you mentioned United Launch
 

345
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,159
down and you mentioned United Launch
Alliance and so I don't want to speak

346
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:25,169
Alliance and so I don't want to speak
 

347
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:28,040
Alliance and so I don't want to speak
for ula but obviously they're they're

348
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,050
for ula but obviously they're they're
 

349
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,920
for ula but obviously they're they're
working really hard to on their next

350
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:30,930
working really hard to on their next
 

351
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:35,230
working really hard to on their next
generation of space launch vehicles to

352
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:35,240
generation of space launch vehicles to
 

353
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,850
generation of space launch vehicles to
you know maintain that incredible

354
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:37,860
you know maintain that incredible
 

355
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,429
you know maintain that incredible
mission success record that ula has but

356
00:07:40,429 --> 00:07:40,439
mission success record that ula has but
 

357
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:42,139
mission success record that ula has but
ultimately continue to drive down the

358
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:42,149
ultimately continue to drive down the
 

359
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:44,240
ultimately continue to drive down the
cost and make the flexibility the speed

360
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,250
cost and make the flexibility the speed
 

361
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,240
cost and make the flexibility the speed
and the access ever greater so what's

362
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,250
and the access ever greater so what's
 

363
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,329
and the access ever greater so what's
the missions that are in the horizon

364
00:07:50,329 --> 00:07:50,339
the missions that are in the horizon
 

365
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:52,550
the missions that are in the horizon
that you could talk to so I hope to get

366
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:52,560
that you could talk to so I hope to get
 

367
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,860
that you could talk to so I hope to get
to the moon absolutely absolutely I mean

368
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:54,870
to the moon absolutely absolutely I mean
 

369
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,290
to the moon absolutely absolutely I mean
I think you know this or you may know

370
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:57,300
I think you know this or you may know
 

371
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,179
I think you know this or you may know
this you know there's a lot of ways to

372
00:07:59,179 --> 00:07:59,189
this you know there's a lot of ways to
 

373
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:00,920
this you know there's a lot of ways to
accomplish some of these goals and so

374
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:00,930
accomplish some of these goals and so
 

375
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,899
accomplish some of these goals and so
that's a lot of what's in discussion

376
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:02,909
that's a lot of what's in discussion
 

377
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:05,659
that's a lot of what's in discussion
today but ultimately the the goal is to

378
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:05,669
today but ultimately the the goal is to
 

379
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:09,499
today but ultimately the the goal is to
be able to establish a base essentially

380
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:09,509
be able to establish a base essentially
 

381
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:12,079
be able to establish a base essentially
insist lunar space that would allow for

382
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:12,089
insist lunar space that would allow for
 

383
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:18,230
insist lunar space that would allow for
ready transfer from orbit to the lunar

384
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
ready transfer from orbit to the lunar
 

385
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,300
ready transfer from orbit to the lunar
surface and back again and so that's

386
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:20,310
surface and back again and so that's
 

387
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,159
surface and back again and so that's
sort of that near-term and I say

388
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:22,169
sort of that near-term and I say
 

389
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,959
sort of that near-term and I say
near-term in the next decade or so

390
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:23,969
near-term in the next decade or so
 

391
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:25,499
near-term in the next decade or so
vision

392
00:08:25,499 --> 00:08:25,509
vision
 

393
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:27,839
vision
starting off with you know stated

394
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:27,849
starting off with you know stated
 

395
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:30,089
starting off with you know stated
objective by this administration to get

396
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:30,099
objective by this administration to get
 

397
00:08:30,099 --> 00:08:31,799
objective by this administration to get
back to the moon in the nineteen or the

398
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:31,809
back to the moon in the nineteen or the
 

399
00:08:31,809 --> 00:08:35,610
back to the moon in the nineteen or the
2024 2025 timeframe which is is right

400
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:35,620
2024 2025 timeframe which is is right
 

401
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,680
2024 2025 timeframe which is is right
around the corner here so how big of an

402
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:37,690
around the corner here so how big of an
 

403
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:41,879
around the corner here so how big of an
engineering challenge is that I think

404
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:41,889
engineering challenge is that I think
 

405
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:44,189
engineering challenge is that I think
the big challenge is not so much to go

406
00:08:44,189 --> 00:08:44,199
the big challenge is not so much to go
 

407
00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:46,050
the big challenge is not so much to go
but to stay right

408
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:46,060
but to stay right
 

409
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,019
but to stay right
and so we demonstrated in the 60s that

410
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:49,029
and so we demonstrated in the 60s that
 

411
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,449
and so we demonstrated in the 60s that
you could send somebody up to a couple

412
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:51,459
you could send somebody up to a couple
 

413
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:53,490
you could send somebody up to a couple
of days of mission and bring them home

414
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:53,500
of days of mission and bring them home
 

415
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,370
of days of mission and bring them home
again successfully now we're talking

416
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:56,380
again successfully now we're talking
 

417
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,560
again successfully now we're talking
about doing that I'd say more time I was

418
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:58,570
about doing that I'd say more time I was
 

419
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,449
about doing that I'd say more time I was
saying adust real scale but a sustained

420
00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:00,459
saying adust real scale but a sustained
 

421
00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:04,920
saying adust real scale but a sustained
scale right so permanent habitation you

422
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:04,930
scale right so permanent habitation you
 

423
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:09,350
scale right so permanent habitation you
know regular reuse of vehicles the

424
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:09,360
know regular reuse of vehicles the
 

425
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,540
know regular reuse of vehicles the
infrastructure to get things like fuel

426
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:12,550
infrastructure to get things like fuel
 

427
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:17,220
infrastructure to get things like fuel
air consumables replacement parts all

428
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:17,230
air consumables replacement parts all
 

429
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,079
air consumables replacement parts all
the things that you need to sustain that

430
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:19,089
the things that you need to sustain that
 

431
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:21,360
the things that you need to sustain that
kind of infrastructure so those are

432
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,370
kind of infrastructure so those are
 

433
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,790
kind of infrastructure so those are
certainly engineering challenges there

434
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:23,800
certainly engineering challenges there
 

435
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,319
certainly engineering challenges there
are budgetary challenges and those are

436
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:28,329
are budgetary challenges and those are
 

437
00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:30,000
are budgetary challenges and those are
all things that we're gonna have to work

438
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,010
all things that we're gonna have to work
 

439
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,009
all things that we're gonna have to work
through you know the other thing and I

440
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:32,019
through you know the other thing and I
 

441
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:34,980
through you know the other thing and I
shouldn't I don't want to minimize this

442
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:34,990
shouldn't I don't want to minimize this
 

443
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,720
shouldn't I don't want to minimize this
I mean I'm excited about human

444
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:36,730
I mean I'm excited about human
 

445
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:39,720
I mean I'm excited about human
exploration but the reality is our

446
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:39,730
exploration but the reality is our
 

447
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,850
exploration but the reality is our
technology and where we've come over the

448
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:41,860
technology and where we've come over the
 

449
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,309
technology and where we've come over the
last you know forty years essentially

450
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:44,319
last you know forty years essentially
 

451
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:47,280
last you know forty years essentially
has changed what we can do with robotic

452
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:47,290
has changed what we can do with robotic
 

453
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:50,730
has changed what we can do with robotic
exploration as well and you know to me

454
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:50,740
exploration as well and you know to me
 

455
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,379
exploration as well and you know to me
it's incredibly thrilling this seems

456
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:52,389
it's incredibly thrilling this seems
 

457
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:54,840
it's incredibly thrilling this seems
like old news now but the fact that we

458
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:54,850
like old news now but the fact that we
 

459
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:57,900
like old news now but the fact that we
have Rovers driving around the surface

460
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:57,910
have Rovers driving around the surface
 

461
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,750
have Rovers driving around the surface
of Mars and sending back data is just

462
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:00,760
of Mars and sending back data is just
 

463
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,009
of Mars and sending back data is just
incredible the fact that we have

464
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:02,019
incredible the fact that we have
 

465
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:04,500
incredible the fact that we have
satellites in orbit around Mars that are

466
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:04,510
satellites in orbit around Mars that are
 

467
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,540
satellites in orbit around Mars that are
collecting weather you know they're

468
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:06,550
collecting weather you know they're
 

469
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,040
collecting weather you know they're
looking at the terrain they're mapping

470
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,050
looking at the terrain they're mapping
 

471
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,900
looking at the terrain they're mapping
all these kinds of things on a

472
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:09,910
all these kinds of things on a
 

473
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,360
all these kinds of things on a
continuous basis that's incredible and

474
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:12,370
continuous basis that's incredible and
 

475
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,759
continuous basis that's incredible and
the fact that you know it's you got the

476
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:14,769
the fact that you know it's you got the
 

477
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:17,160
the fact that you know it's you got the
time lag of course going to the going to

478
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,170
time lag of course going to the going to
 

479
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,309
time lag of course going to the going to
the planets but you can effectively have

480
00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:19,319
the planets but you can effectively have
 

481
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:23,370
the planets but you can effectively have
virtual human presence there in a way

482
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:23,380
virtual human presence there in a way
 

483
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,139
virtual human presence there in a way
that we have never been able to do

484
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:25,149
that we have never been able to do
 

485
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:25,650
that we have never been able to do
before

486
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:25,660
before
 

487
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,350
before
and now with the advent of even greater

488
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:28,360
and now with the advent of even greater
 

489
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,519
and now with the advent of even greater
processing power better AI systems

490
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:31,529
processing power better AI systems
 

491
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:34,110
processing power better AI systems
better cognitive systems and decision

492
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:34,120
better cognitive systems and decision
 

493
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,900
better cognitive systems and decision
systems you know you put that together

494
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:36,910
systems you know you put that together
 

495
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,980
systems you know you put that together
with the human

496
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:37,990
with the human
 

497
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,710

Keith and we really opened up the solar

498
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:40,720
Keith and we really opened up the solar
 

499
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,660
Keith and we really opened up the solar
system in a whole different way and I'll

500
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:42,670
system in a whole different way and I'll
 

501
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,380
system in a whole different way and I'll
give you an example

502
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:43,390
give you an example
 

503
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,870
give you an example
we've got osiris-rex which is a mission

504
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:45,880
we've got osiris-rex which is a mission
 

505
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,470
we've got osiris-rex which is a mission
to the asteroid Bennu so the spacecraft

506
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:49,480
to the asteroid Bennu so the spacecraft
 

507
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,540
to the asteroid Bennu so the spacecraft
is out there right now I'm basically a

508
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:51,550
is out there right now I'm basically a
 

509
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,470
is out there right now I'm basically a
year mapping activity to map the entire

510
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:55,480
year mapping activity to map the entire
 

511
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,310
year mapping activity to map the entire
surface of that asteroid in great detail

512
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
surface of that asteroid in great detail
 

513
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,160
surface of that asteroid in great detail
you know all autonomously piloted right

514
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,170
you know all autonomously piloted right
 

515
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,440
you know all autonomously piloted right
with the idea then that this is not too

516
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:04,450
with the idea then that this is not too
 

517
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,330
with the idea then that this is not too
far away it's gonna go in it's got a

518
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:06,340
far away it's gonna go in it's got a
 

519
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,790
far away it's gonna go in it's got a
sort of fancy vacuum cleaner with a

520
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:08,800
sort of fancy vacuum cleaner with a
 

521
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,280
sort of fancy vacuum cleaner with a
bucket it's gonna collect the sample off

522
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:11,290
bucket it's gonna collect the sample off
 

523
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,860
bucket it's gonna collect the sample off
the asteroid and then send it back here

524
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:13,870
the asteroid and then send it back here
 

525
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,620
the asteroid and then send it back here
to earth and so you know we have gone

526
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:16,630
to earth and so you know we have gone
 

527
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,020
to earth and so you know we have gone
from sort of those tentative steps in

528
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:19,030
from sort of those tentative steps in
 

529
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:23,010
from sort of those tentative steps in
the 70s you know early landings video of

530
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:23,020
the 70s you know early landings video of
 

531
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,440
the 70s you know early landings video of
the solar system so now we've sent

532
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:25,450
the solar system so now we've sent
 

533
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,230
the solar system so now we've sent
spacecraft the Pluto we have gone to

534
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,240
spacecraft the Pluto we have gone to
 

535
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,140
spacecraft the Pluto we have gone to
comets and brought and an intercept at

536
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:31,150
comets and brought and an intercept at
 

537
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:34,080
comets and brought and an intercept at
comets we've brought stardust date you

538
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,090
comets we've brought stardust date you
 

539
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,930
comets we've brought stardust date you
know you know material back

540
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:36,940
know you know material back
 

541
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,160
know you know material back
so that's we've gone far and there's

542
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,170
so that's we've gone far and there's
 

543
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,960
so that's we've gone far and there's
incredible opportunity to go even

544
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:42,970
incredible opportunity to go even
 

545
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:43,410
incredible opportunity to go even
farther

546
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:43,420
farther
 

547
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,260
farther
so it seems quite crazy that this is

548
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:46,270
so it seems quite crazy that this is
 

549
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,100
so it seems quite crazy that this is
even possible

550
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,110
even possible
 

551
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:50,940
even possible
that can you talk a little bit about

552
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:50,950
that can you talk a little bit about
 

553
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,910
that can you talk a little bit about
what it means to orbit an asteroid and

554
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:53,920
what it means to orbit an asteroid and
 

555
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,400
what it means to orbit an asteroid and
with a bucket to try to keep pick up

556
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:56,410
with a bucket to try to keep pick up
 

557
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:00,090
with a bucket to try to keep pick up
some soil samples yeah so part of it is

558
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:00,100
some soil samples yeah so part of it is
 

559
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,270
some soil samples yeah so part of it is
just kind of the you know these are the

560
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:03,280
just kind of the you know these are the
 

561
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,700
just kind of the you know these are the
kinds of techniques we use here on earth

562
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:05,710
kinds of techniques we use here on earth
 

563
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:10,410
kinds of techniques we use here on earth
for high speed high speed high accuracy

564
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:10,420
for high speed high speed high accuracy
 

565
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,390
for high speed high speed high accuracy
imagery stitching these scenes together

566
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:12,400
imagery stitching these scenes together
 

567
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,600
imagery stitching these scenes together
and creating essentially high accuracy

568
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:15,610
and creating essentially high accuracy
 

569
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,810
and creating essentially high accuracy
world maps right and so that's what

570
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:18,820
world maps right and so that's what
 

571
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,940
world maps right and so that's what
we're doing obviously on a much smaller

572
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:20,950
we're doing obviously on a much smaller
 

573
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,550
we're doing obviously on a much smaller
scale with an asteroid but the other

574
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:23,560
scale with an asteroid but the other
 

575
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,230
scale with an asteroid but the other
thing that's really interesting you put

576
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:25,240
thing that's really interesting you put
 

577
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,640
thing that's really interesting you put
together sort of that neat control and

578
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:28,650
together sort of that neat control and
 

579
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:33,810
together sort of that neat control and
you know data and imagery problem but

580
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:33,820
you know data and imagery problem but
 

581
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,120
you know data and imagery problem but
the stories around how we design the

582
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,130
the stories around how we design the
 

583
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,280
the stories around how we design the
collection I mean as essentially you

584
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:38,290
collection I mean as essentially you
 

585
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,810
collection I mean as essentially you
know this is the sort of the human

586
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:39,820
know this is the sort of the human
 

587
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,870
know this is the sort of the human
ingenuity element right that essentially

588
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:42,880
ingenuity element right that essentially
 

589
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,200
ingenuity element right that essentially
you know had an engineer who had a

590
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:45,210
you know had an engineer who had a
 

591
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:48,660
you know had an engineer who had a
one-day cycle starts messing around with

592
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:48,670
one-day cycle starts messing around with
 

593
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,060
one-day cycle starts messing around with
parts vacuum cleaner bucket you know

594
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:51,070
parts vacuum cleaner bucket you know
 

595
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,340
parts vacuum cleaner bucket you know
maybe we could do something like this

596
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:53,350
maybe we could do something like this
 

597
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,050
maybe we could do something like this
and that was what led to what we call

598
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:55,060
and that was what led to what we call
 

599
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,120
and that was what led to what we call
the pogo stick collection right we're

600
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,130
the pogo stick collection right we're
 

601
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,580
the pogo stick collection right we're
basically I think comes down it's only

602
00:12:59,580 --> 00:12:59,590
basically I think comes down it's only
 

603
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,340
basically I think comes down it's only
there for seconds does that collection

604
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:02,350
there for seconds does that collection
 

605
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,880
there for seconds does that collection
grabs the essentially blows them the

606
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:05,890
grabs the essentially blows them the
 

607
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,490
grabs the essentially blows them the
regolith material into the collection

608
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:08,500
regolith material into the collection
 

609
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,140
regolith material into the collection
hopper and off it goes

610
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:10,150
hopper and off it goes
 

611
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,240
hopper and off it goes
it doesn't really land almost it's it's

612
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,250
it doesn't really land almost it's it's
 

613
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,460
it doesn't really land almost it's it's
a very short landing Wow that's that's

614
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:14,470
a very short landing Wow that's that's
 

615
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:19,890
a very short landing Wow that's that's
incredible so what is uh in those talk a

616
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:19,900
incredible so what is uh in those talk a
 

617
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,440
incredible so what is uh in those talk a
little bit more about space eh what's

618
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:22,450
little bit more about space eh what's
 

619
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,970
little bit more about space eh what's
the role of the human in all of this

620
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:23,980
the role of the human in all of this
 

621
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,190
the role of the human in all of this
what are the challenges what are the

622
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:26,200
what are the challenges what are the
 

623
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,970
what are the challenges what are the
opportunities for humans as they pilot

624
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:29,980
opportunities for humans as they pilot
 

625
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:34,500
opportunities for humans as they pilot
these these vehicles in space and for

626
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:34,510
these these vehicles in space and for
 

627
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:39,030
these these vehicles in space and for
humans that may step foot and on either

628
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,040
humans that may step foot and on either
 

629
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,120
humans that may step foot and on either
the Moon or Mars yeah it's a great

630
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,130
the Moon or Mars yeah it's a great
 

631
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,400
the Moon or Mars yeah it's a great
question because you know I just have

632
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:44,410
question because you know I just have
 

633
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,560
question because you know I just have
been extolling the virtues of robotic

634
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:46,570
been extolling the virtues of robotic
 

635
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,550
been extolling the virtues of robotic
and you know Rovers autonomous systems

636
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:50,560
and you know Rovers autonomous systems
 

637
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,390
and you know Rovers autonomous systems
and those absolutely have a role I think

638
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:54,400
and those absolutely have a role I think
 

639
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,890
and those absolutely have a role I think
the thing that we don't know how to

640
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:55,900
the thing that we don't know how to
 

641
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,670
the thing that we don't know how to
replace today is the ability to adapt on

642
00:13:59,670 --> 00:13:59,680
replace today is the ability to adapt on
 

643
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,860
replace today is the ability to adapt on
the fly to new information

644
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:02,870
the fly to new information
 

645
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:06,880
the fly to new information
and I believe that will come but we're

646
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:06,890
and I believe that will come but we're
 

647
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:09,780
and I believe that will come but we're
not there yet there's a ways to go and

648
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:09,790
not there yet there's a ways to go and
 

649
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:13,270
not there yet there's a ways to go and
so you know you think back to Apollo 13

650
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:13,280
so you know you think back to Apollo 13
 

651
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,550
so you know you think back to Apollo 13
and the ingenuity of the folks on the

652
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:15,560
and the ingenuity of the folks on the
 

653
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,520
and the ingenuity of the folks on the
ground and on the spacecraft essentially

654
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:17,530
ground and on the spacecraft essentially
 

655
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:20,830
ground and on the spacecraft essentially
cobbled together a way to get the carbon

656
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:20,840
cobbled together a way to get the carbon
 

657
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,160
cobbled together a way to get the carbon
dioxide scrubbers to work those are the

658
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,170
dioxide scrubbers to work those are the
 

659
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,580
dioxide scrubbers to work those are the
kinds of things that ultimately young

660
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:27,590
kinds of things that ultimately young
 

661
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:30,580
kinds of things that ultimately young
and I'd say not just from dealing with

662
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:30,590
and I'd say not just from dealing with
 

663
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,680
and I'd say not just from dealing with
anomalies but you know dealing with new

664
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:32,690
anomalies but you know dealing with new
 

665
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,860
anomalies but you know dealing with new
information you see something and rather

666
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:35,870
information you see something and rather
 

667
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,770
information you see something and rather
than waiting twenty minutes or half an

00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:38,780
than waiting twenty minutes or half an

essentially Ravech there on the fly

674
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:45,140
essentially Ravech there on the fly

00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,800
essentially Ravech there on the fly
collect you know different samples take

676
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:47,810
collect you know different samples take
 

677
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:50,460
collect you know different samples take
a different approach choose different

areas to explore those are the kinds of

680
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:53,480
areas to explore those are the kinds of
 

681
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,530
areas to explore those are the kinds of
things that that human presence enables

682
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:56,540
things that that human presence enables
 

683
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,200
things that that human presence enables
that is still a ways ahead of us on the

684
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,210
that is still a ways ahead of us on the
 

685
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,970
that is still a ways ahead of us on the
AI side yeah there's some interesting

686
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:00,980
AI side yeah there's some interesting
 

687
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,010
AI side yeah there's some interesting
stuff we'll talk about on the teaming

688
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:03,020
stuff we'll talk about on the teaming
 

689
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,560
stuff we'll talk about on the teaming
side here on earth that's that's pretty

690
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:05,570
side here on earth that's that's pretty
 

691
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,210
side here on earth that's that's pretty
cool to explore and it's okay so let's

692
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:07,220
cool to explore and it's okay so let's
 

693
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,610
cool to explore and it's okay so let's
not leave the space piece out so what is

694
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:09,620
not leave the space piece out so what is
 

695
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,980
not leave the space piece out so what is
teaming what does AI and humans working

696
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:11,990
teaming what does AI and humans working
 

697
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,290
teaming what does AI and humans working
together in space look like yeah one of

698
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:14,300
together in space look like yeah one of
 

699
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,090
together in space look like yeah one of
the things we're working on is a system

700
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:16,100
the things we're working on is a system
 

701
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,850
the things we're working on is a system
called Maya which is you can think of it

702
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:18,860
called Maya which is you can think of it
 

703
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:23,290
called Maya which is you can think of it
it's what's an AI assistant and in space

704
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:23,300
it's what's an AI assistant and in space
 

705
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,440
it's what's an AI assistant and in space
exactly and you think of it as the Alexa

706
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:26,450
exactly and you think of it as the Alexa
 

707
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:29,320
exactly and you think of it as the Alexa
in space right but this goes

708
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:29,330
in space right but this goes
 

709
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,850
in space right but this goes
hand-in-hand with a lot of other

710
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:30,860
hand-in-hand with a lot of other
 

711
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,160
hand-in-hand with a lot of other
developments and so today's world

712
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,170
developments and so today's world
 

713
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,900
developments and so today's world
everything is essentially model-based

714
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:34,910
everything is essentially model-based
 

715
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,680
everything is essentially model-based
model-based systems engineering to the

716
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:38,690
model-based systems engineering to the
 

717
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,200
model-based systems engineering to the
actual digital tapestry that goes

718
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,210
actual digital tapestry that goes
 

719
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,030
actual digital tapestry that goes
through the design the bill the

720
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,040
through the design the bill the
 

721
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,280
through the design the bill the
manufacturer the testing and ultimately

722
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,290
manufacturer the testing and ultimately
 

723
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,760
manufacturer the testing and ultimately
the sustainment of the system and so our

724
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:48,770
the sustainment of the system and so our
 

725
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,310
the sustainment of the system and so our
vision is really that you know when our

726
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:51,320
vision is really that you know when our
 

727
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,060
vision is really that you know when our
astronauts are there around Mars you're

728
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:55,070
astronauts are there around Mars you're
 

729
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,770
astronauts are there around Mars you're
going to have that entire digital

730
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:56,780
going to have that entire digital
 

731
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,890
going to have that entire digital
library

732
00:15:58,890 --> 00:15:58,900

00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:08,350
flight data from previous missions to be
 

739
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,530
flight data from previous missions to be
able to look and see if there are

00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:10,540
able to look and see if there are
 

741
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,860
able to look and see if there are
anomalous conditions until the humans

anomalous conditions until the humans
 

743
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,410
anomalous conditions until the humans
and potentially deal with that before it

744
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:16,420
and potentially deal with that before it
 

745
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,820
and potentially deal with that before it
becomes a bad situation and help the

746
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:20,830
becomes a bad situation and help the
 

747
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,860
becomes a bad situation and help the
astronauts work through those kinds of

00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:22,870
astronauts work through those kinds of
 

749
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,110
astronauts work through those kinds of
things and it's not just you know

750
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,120
things and it's not just you know
 

751
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,640
things and it's not just you know
dealing with problems as they come up

752
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:26,650
dealing with problems as they come up
 

753
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,240
dealing with problems as they come up
but also offering up opportunities for

00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:29,250
but also offering up opportunities for
 

755

best of AI capabilities to monitor these
 

767
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,630
best of AI capabilities to monitor these
you know this almost infinite number of

768
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:48,640
you know this almost infinite number of
 

769
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,670
you know this almost infinite number of
data points and correlations and data

770
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:50,680
data points and correlations and data
 

771
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,890

good at it's how do you develop systems

774
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:55,150
good at it's how do you develop systems
 

775
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:59,579
good at it's how do you develop systems
in space like this whether it's a alexa

776
00:16:59,579 --> 00:16:59,589
in space like this whether it's a alexa
 

777
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:01,680
in space like this whether it's a alexa
in space or in general any kind of

778
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:01,690
in space or in general any kind of
 

779
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:04,410
in space or in general any kind of
control systems any kind of intelligent

780
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:04,420
control systems any kind of intelligent
 

781
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,449
control systems any kind of intelligent
systems when you can't really test stuff

782
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:06,459
systems when you can't really test stuff
 

783
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,970
systems when you can't really test stuff
too much out in space it's very

784
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:08,980
too much out in space it's very
 

785
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,579
too much out in space it's very
expensive to test stuff here so how do

786
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:11,589
expensive to test stuff here so how do
 

787
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:14,730
expensive to test stuff here so how do
you develop such systems yeah that's

788
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:14,740
you develop such systems yeah that's
 

789
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,280
you develop such systems yeah that's
that that's the beauty of this digital

790
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:17,290
that that's the beauty of this digital
 

791
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:20,189
that that's the beauty of this digital
twin if you will and of course with

792
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:20,199
twin if you will and of course with
 

793
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:22,500
twin if you will and of course with
Lockheed Martin we've over the past you

794
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:22,510
Lockheed Martin we've over the past you
 

795
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:26,010
Lockheed Martin we've over the past you

00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:32,310
knowledge of the space environment of
how materials behave dynamics that

controls the you know radiation

802
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:34,920
controls the you know radiation
 

803
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,960

environments all of these kinds of

804
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:36,970
environments all of these kinds of
 

805
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,460
environments all of these kinds of
things so we're able to create very

806
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:38,470
things so we're able to create very
 

807
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,560
things so we're able to create very
sophisticated models they're not perfect

808
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:40,570
sophisticated models they're not perfect
 

809
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:44,549
sophisticated models they're not perfect
but they're they're very good and so you

810
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:44,559
but they're they're very good and so you
 

811
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,790
but they're they're very good and so you
can actually do a lot I spent part of my

812
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:47,800
can actually do a lot I spent part of my
 

813
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,480
can actually do a lot I spent part of my

835
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:17,279

in the so you still you also have to

860
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:47,890
in the so you still you also have to
 

861
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,889
in the so you still you also have to
model that when you're thinking about

00:18:49,889 --> 00:18:49,899
model that when you're thinking about

I'd say autonomous systems in general

884
00:19:17,399 --> 00:19:17,409
I'd say autonomous systems in general
 

885
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:20,370
I'd say autonomous systems in general
and then as a subset of that autonomous

886
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:20,380
and then as a subset of that autonomous
 

887
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,380
and then as a subset of that autonomous
systems that incorporate artificial

888
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:22,390
systems that incorporate artificial
 

889
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,710
systems that incorporate artificial
intelligence capabilities and this is

890
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:25,720
intelligence capabilities and this is
 

891
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,590
intelligence capabilities and this is
not an easy problem we're working with

892
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:28,600
not an easy problem we're working with
 

893
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,690
not an easy problem we're working with
startup companies we've got internal R&D

894
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:30,700
startup companies we've got internal R&D
 

895
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:35,779
startup companies we've got internal R&D
but our conviction is the autonomy in

896
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:35,789
but our conviction is the autonomy in
 

897
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:39,269
but our conviction is the autonomy in
more and more AI enabled autonomy is

898
00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:39,279
more and more AI enabled autonomy is
 

899
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,340
more and more AI enabled autonomy is
going to be in everything that Lockheed

900
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:41,350
going to be in everything that Lockheed
 

901
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:44,909
going to be in everything that Lockheed
Martin develops and fields and it's

902
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:44,919
Martin develops and fields and it's
 

903
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:47,730
Martin develops and fields and it's
going to be retrofit autonomy and Nai

904
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:47,740
going to be retrofit autonomy and Nai
 

905
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,590
going to be retrofit autonomy and Nai
are gonna be retrofit into existing

906
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:49,600
are gonna be retrofit into existing
 

907
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,090
are gonna be retrofit into existing
systems they're going to be part of the

908
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:51,100
systems they're going to be part of the
 

909
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,539
systems they're going to be part of the
design for all of our future systems and

910
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:54,549
design for all of our future systems and
 

911
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:56,580
design for all of our future systems and
so maybe I should take a step back and

912
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:56,590
so maybe I should take a step back and
 

913
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,860
so maybe I should take a step back and
say the way we define autonomy so we

914
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:58,870
say the way we define autonomy so we
 

915
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,919
say the way we define autonomy so we
talk we talk about autonomy essentially

916
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:00,929
talk we talk about autonomy essentially
 

917
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:05,010
talk we talk about autonomy essentially
system that composes selects and then

918
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:05,020
system that composes selects and then
 

919
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:09,269
system that composes selects and then
executes decisions with varying levels

920
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:09,279
executes decisions with varying levels
 

921
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:14,100
executes decisions with varying levels
of human intervention and so you could

922
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,110
of human intervention and so you could
 

923
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,019
of human intervention and so you could
think of no autonomy so this is

924
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:16,029
think of no autonomy so this is
 

925
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:18,779
think of no autonomy so this is
essentially human doing the task you can

926
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:18,789
essentially human doing the task you can
 

927
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:22,620
essentially human doing the task you can
think of effectively partial autonomy

928
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:22,630
think of effectively partial autonomy
 

929
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:25,580
think of effectively partial autonomy
where the human is in the loop

930
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:25,590
where the human is in the loop
 

931
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,299
where the human is in the loop
so making decisions in every case about

932
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:29,309
so making decisions in every case about
 

933
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:31,370
so making decisions in every case about
what the autonomous system can do either

934
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:31,380
what the autonomous system can do either
 

935
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,650
what the autonomous system can do either
in the cockpit or remotely or remotely

936
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:33,660
in the cockpit or remotely or remotely
 

937
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,870
in the cockpit or remotely or remotely
exactly but still in that control loop

938
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:35,880
exactly but still in that control loop
 

939
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,720
exactly but still in that control loop
and then there's what you'd call

940
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:37,730
and then there's what you'd call
 

941
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,370
and then there's what you'd call
supervisory autonomy the autonomous

942
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:40,380
supervisory autonomy the autonomous
 

943
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,440
supervisory autonomy the autonomous
system is doing most of the work the

944
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:42,450
system is doing most of the work the
 

945
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,450
system is doing most of the work the
human can intervene to stop it or to

946
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:44,460
human can intervene to stop it or to
 

947
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,280
human can intervene to stop it or to
change the direction and then ultimately

948
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:46,290
change the direction and then ultimately
 

949
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,470
change the direction and then ultimately
fall at full autonomy where the human is

950
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:48,480
fall at full autonomy where the human is
 

951
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,530
fall at full autonomy where the human is
off the loop altogether and for

952
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:51,540
off the loop altogether and for
 

953
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,270
off the loop altogether and for
different types of missions want to have

954
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:53,280
different types of missions want to have
 

955
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,419
different types of missions want to have
different levels of autonomy so now take

956
00:20:56,419 --> 00:20:56,429
different levels of autonomy so now take
 

957
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:58,430
different levels of autonomy so now take
that spectrum and this conviction that

958
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:58,440
that spectrum and this conviction that
 

959
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,430
that spectrum and this conviction that
autonomy and more and more AI are in

960
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:01,440
autonomy and more and more AI are in
 

961
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,510
autonomy and more and more AI are in

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,310
everything that we develop I the kinds

964
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:07,320
of things that Lockheed Martin does you
 

965
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,830

know a lot of times our safety of life

966
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:09,840
know a lot of times our safety of life

critical kinds of missions you think

968
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:12,840
critical kinds of missions you think
 

969
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,360
critical kinds of missions you think
about aircraft for example and so we

970
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:17,370
about aircraft for example and so we
 

971
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:20,180
about aircraft for example and so we
require and our customers require an

972
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:20,190
require and our customers require an
 

973
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:23,780
require and our customers require an
extremely high level of confidence one

974
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:23,790
extremely high level of confidence one
 

975
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,460
extremely high level of confidence one
that you know we're going to protect

00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:25,470
that you know we're going to protect

00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:28,700
that you know we're going to protect

00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:31,410
these systems will behave in ways that
 

981
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:34,310
these systems will behave in ways that
their operators can understand and so

982
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:34,320
their operators can understand and so
 

983
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,650
their operators can understand and so
this gets into that whole field again

984
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:36,660
this gets into that whole field again
 

985
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,930
this gets into that whole field again
you know they're being able to verify

986
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:38,940
you know they're being able to verify
 

987
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,830
you know they're being able to verify
and validate that the systems have been

988
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:42,840
and validate that the systems have been
 

989
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,289
and validate that the systems have been
and that they will operate the way

990
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:45,299
and that they will operate the way
 

991
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:46,760
and that they will operate the way
they're design and the way they're

992
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:46,770
they're design and the way they're
 

993
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:49,880
they're design and the way they're
expected and furthermore that they will

994
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:49,890
expected and furthermore that they will
 

995
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:53,780
expected and furthermore that they will
do that in ways that can be explained

996
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:53,790
do that in ways that can be explained
 

997
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:57,169
do that in ways that can be explained
and understood and that is an extremely

00:21:57,169 --> 00:21:57,179
and understood and that is an extremely
 

999
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:59,750
and understood and that is an extremely
difficult challenge yes so here's a

1000
00:21:59,750 --> 00:21:59,760
difficult challenge yes so here's a
 

1001
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,950
difficult challenge yes so here's a
difficult question I don't mean to bring

1002
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:03,960
difficult question I don't mean to bring
 

1003
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,360
difficult question I don't mean to bring
this up but I think it's a good case

1004
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:05,370
this up but I think it's a good case
 

1005
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,370
this up but I think it's a good case

Boeing 737 max commercial airplane has
 

1009
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,789
Boeing 737 max commercial airplane has
had two recent crashes where their

00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,770
had two recent crashes where their
flight control software system failed

1012

flight control software system failed
 

1013
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,080
flight control software system failed
and it's software so I don't mean to

1014
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,090
and it's software so I don't mean to
 

1015
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,700
and it's software so I don't mean to
speak of all Boeing but broadly speaking

1016
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:19,710
speak of all Boeing but broadly speaking
 

1017
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,980
speak of all Boeing but broadly speaking
we have this than the autonomous vehicle

1018
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:21,990
we have this than the autonomous vehicle
 

1019
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,830
we have this than the autonomous vehicle

of lines of code software making
 

1023
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,640

00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:31,650
decisions there is a little bit of a
 

1025
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,919

engineers don't have the same culture of

00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:37,169
engineers don't have the same culture of
 

1029
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:38,680
engineers don't have the same culture of

that people who build systems like at

1032
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,090
that people who build systems like at
 

1033
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:45,470
that people who build systems like at
Lockheed Martin uh do where it has to be

1034
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:45,480
Lockheed Martin uh do where it has to be
 

1035
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,150
Lockheed Martin uh do where it has to be
exceptionally safe you have to test this

1036
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:47,160
exceptionally safe you have to test this
 

1037
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,000
exceptionally safe you have to test this
on so how do we get this right when

1038
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,010
on so how do we get this right when
 

1039
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,330
on so how do we get this right when
software is making so many decisions

1040
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:52,340
software is making so many decisions
 

1041
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,970
software is making so many decisions
yeah and this there's a lot of things

1042
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:55,980
yeah and this there's a lot of things
 

1043
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,480
yeah and this there's a lot of things
that have to happen and by and large I

1044
00:22:59,480 --> 00:22:59,490
that have to happen and by and large I
 

1045
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,160
that have to happen and by and large I
think it starts with the culture right

1046
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,170
think it starts with the culture right
 

1047
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,500
think it starts with the culture right
which is not necessarily something that

00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:11,080
that would come here depending on what
kind of software you're developing it

1054
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,090
kind of software you're developing it
 

1055
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,340
kind of software you're developing it
may not be relevant right if you're

1056
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:13,350
may not be relevant right if you're
 

1057
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,060
may not be relevant right if you're
targeting ads or something like that so

1058
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:16,070
targeting ads or something like that so
 

1059
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,120
targeting ads or something like that so
and by and large say not just Lockheed

1060
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:20,130
and by and large say not just Lockheed
 

1061
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:22,070
and by and large say not just Lockheed

1063

00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:41,120
possibilities have we done the right
range of testing do we really understand

1116
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,130
range of testing do we really understand
 

1117
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:43,040
range of testing do we really understand
you know in this case you know human and

1118
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,050
you know in this case you know human and
 

1119
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,410
you know in this case you know human and
machine interactions the human decision

1120
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:45,420
machine interactions the human decision
 

1121
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:49,160
machine interactions the human decision
process alongside the machine processes

1122
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:49,170
process alongside the machine processes
 

1123
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,950
process alongside the machine processes
and so that's that culture that we call

1124
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:51,960
and so that's that culture that we call
 

1125
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,649
and so that's that culture that we call
it the culture of

1126
00:24:52,649 --> 00:24:52,659
it the culture of
 

1127
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:55,349
it the culture of
success in lockheed-martin that really

1128
00:24:55,349 --> 00:24:55,359
success in lockheed-martin that really
 

1129
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:57,029
success in lockheed-martin that really
needs to be established and it's not

1130
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:57,039
needs to be established and it's not
 

1131
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,349
needs to be established and it's not
something you know that it's something

1132
00:24:58,349 --> 00:24:58,359
something you know that it's something
 

1133
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:02,190
something you know that it's something
that people learn by living in it and

1134
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:02,200
that people learn by living in it and
 

1135
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,359
that people learn by living in it and
it's something that has to be

1136
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:03,369
it's something that has to be
 

1137
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:05,969
it's something that has to be
promulgated you know and it's done you

1138
00:25:05,969 --> 00:25:05,979
promulgated you know and it's done you
 

1139
00:25:05,979 --> 00:25:07,680
promulgated you know and it's done you
know from the highest levels at a

1140
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:07,690
know from the highest levels at a
 

1141
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,539
know from the highest levels at a
company of Lockheed Martin like Lockheed

1142
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:09,549
company of Lockheed Martin like Lockheed
 

1143
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:12,359
company of Lockheed Martin like Lockheed
Martin yeah and the same as being faced

1144
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:12,369
Martin yeah and the same as being faced
 

1145
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:13,919
Martin yeah and the same as being faced
at certain on his vehicle companies

1146
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:13,929
at certain on his vehicle companies
 

1147
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,049
at certain on his vehicle companies
where that culture is not there because

1148
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:16,059
where that culture is not there because
 

1149
00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:18,089
where that culture is not there because
it started mostly by software engineers

1150
00:25:18,089 --> 00:25:18,099
it started mostly by software engineers
 

1151
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,239
it started mostly by software engineers
so that's what they're struggling with

1152
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:20,249
so that's what they're struggling with
 

1153
00:25:20,249 --> 00:25:24,810
so that's what they're struggling with
is there lessons that you think we

1154
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:24,820
is there lessons that you think we
 

1155
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,239
is there lessons that you think we
should learn as an industry in a society

1156
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:27,249
should learn as an industry in a society
 

1157
00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:30,419
should learn as an industry in a society
from the Boeing 737 max questions these

1158
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:30,429
from the Boeing 737 max questions these
 

1159
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:33,119
from the Boeing 737 max questions these
crashes obviously are their tremendous

1160
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:33,129
crashes obviously are their tremendous
 

1161
00:25:33,129 --> 00:25:37,320
crashes obviously are their tremendous
tragedies their tragedies for all of the

1162
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:37,330
tragedies their tragedies for all of the
 

1163
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:40,109
tragedies their tragedies for all of the
people the the crew the families the

1164
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:40,119
people the the crew the families the
 

1165
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:42,119
people the the crew the families the
passengers the people on the ground

1166
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:42,129
passengers the people on the ground
 

1167
00:25:42,129 --> 00:25:46,399
passengers the people on the ground
involved and you know it's also a huge

1168
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:46,409
involved and you know it's also a huge
 

1169
00:25:46,409 --> 00:25:48,989
involved and you know it's also a huge
business and economic setback as well I

1170
00:25:48,989 --> 00:25:48,999
business and economic setback as well I
 

1171
00:25:48,999 --> 00:25:50,310
business and economic setback as well I
mean you know we've seen that it's

1172
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:50,320
mean you know we've seen that it's
 

1173
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,289
mean you know we've seen that it's
impacting essentially the trade balance

1174
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:52,299
impacting essentially the trade balance
 

1175
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:55,190
impacting essentially the trade balance
of the US so these are these are

1176
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:55,200
of the US so these are these are
 

1177
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,489
of the US so these are these are
important questions and these are the

1178
00:25:59,489 --> 00:25:59,499
important questions and these are the
 

1179
00:25:59,499 --> 00:26:01,049
important questions and these are the
kinds that you know we've seen similar

1180
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:01,059
kinds that you know we've seen similar
 

1181
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,450
kinds that you know we've seen similar
kinds of questioning at times you go

1182
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:03,460
kinds of questioning at times you go
 

1183
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:07,499
kinds of questioning at times you go
back to the Challenger accident and it

1184
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:07,509
back to the Challenger accident and it
 

1185
00:26:07,509 --> 00:26:09,839
back to the Challenger accident and it
is I think always important to remind

1186
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:09,849
is I think always important to remind
 

1187
00:26:09,849 --> 00:26:12,029
is I think always important to remind
ourselves the humans are fallible the

1188
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:12,039
ourselves the humans are fallible the
 

1189
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:14,940
ourselves the humans are fallible the
systems we create as perfect as we

1190
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:14,950
systems we create as perfect as we
 

1191
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:17,609
systems we create as perfect as we
strive to make them we can always make

1192
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:17,619
strive to make them we can always make
 

1193
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:20,070
strive to make them we can always make
them better and so another element of

1194
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,080
them better and so another element of
 

1195
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,810
them better and so another element of
that culture of mission success is

1196
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:21,820
that culture of mission success is
 

1197
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,789
that culture of mission success is
really that commitment to continuous

1198
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:23,799
really that commitment to continuous
 

1199
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:25,799
really that commitment to continuous
improvement if there's something that

1200
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:25,809
improvement if there's something that
 

1201
00:26:25,809 --> 00:26:29,849
improvement if there's something that
goes wrong a real commitment to root

1202
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:29,859
goes wrong a real commitment to root
 

1203
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:32,849
goes wrong a real commitment to root
cause and true root cause understanding

1204
00:26:32,849 --> 00:26:32,859
cause and true root cause understanding
 

1205
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:35,399
cause and true root cause understanding
to taking the corrective actions and to

1206
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:35,409
to taking the corrective actions and to
 

1207
00:26:35,409 --> 00:26:37,979
to taking the corrective actions and to
making the system future systems better

1208
00:26:37,979 --> 00:26:37,989
making the system future systems better
 

1209
00:26:37,989 --> 00:26:42,599
making the system future systems better
and certainly we want we strive for you

1210
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:42,609
and certainly we want we strive for you
 

1211
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:46,409
and certainly we want we strive for you
know you know no accidents and if you

1212
00:26:46,409 --> 00:26:46,419
know you know no accidents and if you
 

1213
00:26:46,419 --> 00:26:48,479
know you know no accidents and if you
look at the record of the commercial

1214
00:26:48,479 --> 00:26:48,489
look at the record of the commercial
 

1215
00:26:48,489 --> 00:26:50,580
look at the record of the commercial
airline industry as a whole and the

1216
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:50,590
airline industry as a whole and the
 

1217
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,139
airline industry as a whole and the
commercial aircraft industry as a whole

1218
00:26:52,139 --> 00:26:52,149
commercial aircraft industry as a whole
 

1219
00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:56,039
commercial aircraft industry as a whole
you know there's a very nice decaying

1220
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:56,049
you know there's a very nice decaying
 

1221
00:26:56,049 --> 00:26:58,830
you know there's a very nice decaying
exponential two years now where we have

1222
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:58,840
exponential two years now where we have
 

1223
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,889
exponential two years now where we have
no commercial aircraft accidents at all

1224
00:27:01,889 --> 00:27:01,899
no commercial aircraft accidents at all
 

1225
00:27:01,899 --> 00:27:04,180
no commercial aircraft accidents at all
right and our fatal accidents and all

1226
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:04,190
right and our fatal accidents and all
 

1227
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:08,680
right and our fatal accidents and all
so that didn't happen by accident it was

1228
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:08,690
so that didn't happen by accident it was
 

1229
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:11,770
so that didn't happen by accident it was
through the regulatory agencies FAA the

1230
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:11,780
through the regulatory agencies FAA the
 

1231
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:15,340
through the regulatory agencies FAA the
airframe manufacturers really working on

1232
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:15,350
airframe manufacturers really working on
 

1233
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:18,580
airframe manufacturers really working on
a system to identify root causes and

1234
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:18,590
a system to identify root causes and
 

1235
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:22,420
a system to identify root causes and
driving them out so maybe we can take a

1236
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:22,430
driving them out so maybe we can take a
 

1237
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:25,000
driving them out so maybe we can take a
step back and many people are familiar

1238
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,010
step back and many people are familiar
 

1239
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:29,230
step back and many people are familiar
but Lockheed Martin broadly what kind of

1240
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:29,240
but Lockheed Martin broadly what kind of
 

1241
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,890
but Lockheed Martin broadly what kind of
categories of systems are you involved

1242
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:32,900
categories of systems are you involved
 

1243
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,200
categories of systems are you involved
in building you know Lockheed Martin we

1244
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:35,210
in building you know Lockheed Martin we
 

1245
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:37,450
in building you know Lockheed Martin we
think of ourselves as a company that

1246
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:37,460
think of ourselves as a company that
 

1247
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,120
think of ourselves as a company that
solves hard mission problems and the

1248
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:40,130
solves hard mission problems and the
 

1249
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:42,160
solves hard mission problems and the
output of that might be an airplane or

1250
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,170
output of that might be an airplane or
 

1251
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:44,710
output of that might be an airplane or
spacecraft or a helicopter or a radar or

1252
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:44,720
spacecraft or a helicopter or a radar or
 

1253
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,570
spacecraft or a helicopter or a radar or
something like that but ultimately we're

1254
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:46,580
something like that but ultimately we're
 

1255
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,240
something like that but ultimately we're
driven by these you know like what what

1256
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:49,250
driven by these you know like what what
 

1257
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,190
driven by these you know like what what
is our customer what is that mission

1258
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:51,200
is our customer what is that mission
 

1259
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,560
is our customer what is that mission
that they need to achieve and so that's

1260
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:53,570
that they need to achieve and so that's
 

1261
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:55,900
that they need to achieve and so that's
what drove the sr-71 right how do you

1262
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:55,910
what drove the sr-71 right how do you
 

1263
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:59,590
what drove the sr-71 right how do you
get pictures of a place where you got

1264
00:27:59,590 --> 00:27:59,600
get pictures of a place where you got
 

1265
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,320
get pictures of a place where you got
sophisticated air defense systems that

1266
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:02,330
sophisticated air defense systems that
 

1267
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:05,020
sophisticated air defense systems that
are capable of handling any aircraft

1268
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,030
are capable of handling any aircraft
 

1269
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,600
are capable of handling any aircraft
that was out there at the time right so

1270
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:07,610
that was out there at the time right so
 

1271
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,400
that was out there at the time right so
that you know that's what you'll did an

1272
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:09,410
that you know that's what you'll did an
 

1273
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:12,180
that you know that's what you'll did an
sr-71 was build a nice flying camera

1274
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:12,190
sr-71 was build a nice flying camera
 

1275
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,740
sr-71 was build a nice flying camera
exactly and make sure it gets out and it

1276
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:14,750
exactly and make sure it gets out and it
 

1277
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,930
exactly and make sure it gets out and it
gets back right and that led ultimately

1278
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:16,940
gets back right and that led ultimately
 

1279
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,820
gets back right and that led ultimately
to really the start of the space program

1280
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:18,830
to really the start of the space program
 

1281
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:23,140
to really the start of the space program
in the u.s. as well so now take a step

1282
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:23,150
in the u.s. as well so now take a step
 

1283
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,390
in the u.s. as well so now take a step
back to Lockheed Martin of today and we

1284
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:25,400
back to Lockheed Martin of today and we
 

1285
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,910
back to Lockheed Martin of today and we
are you know on the order of 105 years

1286
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:27,920
are you know on the order of 105 years
 

1287
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,460
are you know on the order of 105 years
old now between Lockheed and Martin the

1288
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:30,470
old now between Lockheed and Martin the
 

1289
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,590
old now between Lockheed and Martin the
two big heritage companies of course

1290
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:32,600
two big heritage companies of course
 

1291
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,970
two big heritage companies of course
were made up with a whole bunch of other

1292
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:33,980
were made up with a whole bunch of other
 

1293
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,430
were made up with a whole bunch of other
companies that came in as well General

1294
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:36,440
companies that came in as well General
 

1295
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,120
companies that came in as well General
Dynamics yeah kind of go down the list

1296
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,130
Dynamics yeah kind of go down the list
 

1297
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:43,000
Dynamics yeah kind of go down the list
today were you can think of us in this

1298
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,010
today were you can think of us in this
 

1299
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:45,330
today were you can think of us in this
space of solving mission problems so

1300
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:45,340
space of solving mission problems so
 

1301
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:49,000
space of solving mission problems so
obviously on the aircraft side tactical

1302
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,010
obviously on the aircraft side tactical
 

1303
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,460
obviously on the aircraft side tactical
aircraft building the most advanced

1304

seen you know we're up to now several

1308
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:56,360
seen you know we're up to now several
 

1309
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,270
seen you know we're up to now several
hundred of those delivered building

1310
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:58,280
hundred of those delivered building
 

1311
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,360
hundred of those delivered building
almost a hundred a year and of course

1312
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:01,370
almost a hundred a year and of course
 

1313
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:03,100
almost a hundred a year and of course
working on the things that come after

1314
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:03,110
working on the things that come after
 

1315
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:06,730
working on the things that come after
that on the space side we are engaged in

1316
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:06,740
that on the space side we are engaged in
 

1317
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:10,800
that on the space side we are engaged in
pretty much every venue of space

1318
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:10,810
pretty much every venue of space
 

1319
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:13,450
pretty much every venue of space
utilization and exploration you can

1320
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:13,460
utilization and exploration you can
 

1321
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,300
utilization and exploration you can
imagine so I mentioned things like

1322
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:15,310
imagine so I mentioned things like
 

1323
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,789
imagine so I mentioned things like
navigation timing GP

1324
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:17,799

commercial communication satellites we
 

1333
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:31,330
commercial communication satellites we
do civil space so everything from human

1334
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:31,340
do civil space so everything from human
 

1335
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,460
do civil space so everything from human
exploration to the robotic exploration

1336
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:33,470
exploration to the robotic exploration
 

1337
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:37,360
exploration to the robotic exploration
in the outer planets and keep keep going

1338
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:37,370
in the outer planets and keep keep going
 

1339
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,700
in the outer planets and keep keep going
on the space front but I don't you know

1340
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:39,710
on the space front but I don't you know
 

1341
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:42,310
on the space front but I don't you know
a couple other areas I'd like to put out

1342
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:42,320
a couple other areas I'd like to put out
 

1343
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,799
a couple other areas I'd like to put out
we're heavily engaged in building

1344
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:44,809
we're heavily engaged in building
 

1345
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:48,400
we're heavily engaged in building
critical defensive systems and so a

1346
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:48,410
critical defensive systems and so a
 

1347
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,470
critical defensive systems and so a
couple that I'll mention the aegis

1348
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:50,480
couple that I'll mention the aegis
 

1349
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,720
couple that I'll mention the aegis
combat system this is basically the

1350
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:52,730
combat system this is basically the
 

1351
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,190
combat system this is basically the
integrated air and missile defense

1352
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:54,200
integrated air and missile defense
 

1353
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,240
integrated air and missile defense
system for the u.s. and allied fleets

1354
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:58,250
system for the u.s. and allied fleets
 

1355
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:02,230
system for the u.s. and allied fleets
and so protects you know Carrier Strike

1356
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:02,240
and so protects you know Carrier Strike
 

1357
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,930
and so protects you know Carrier Strike
groups for example from incoming

1358
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:04,940
groups for example from incoming
 

1359

ballistic missile threats aircraft

1360
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:07,040
ballistic missile threats aircraft
 

1361
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,220
ballistic missile threats aircraft
threats cruise missile threats and kind

1362
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:09,230
threats cruise missile threats and kind
 

1363
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,190
threats cruise missile threats and kind
of go down the list of the the carriers

1364
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:11,200
of go down the list of the the carriers
 

1365
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,960
of go down the list of the the carriers
the fleet that itself is the thing that

1366
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:13,970
the fleet that itself is the thing that
 

1367
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,270
the fleet that itself is the thing that
is being protected the carriers aren't

1368
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:16,280
is being protected the carriers aren't
 

1369
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,549
is being protected the carriers aren't
serving as a protection for something

1370
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:18,559
serving as a protection for something
 

1371
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,710
serving as a protection for something
else well that's that's a little bit of

1372
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:20,720
else well that's that's a little bit of
 

1373
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,180
else well that's that's a little bit of
a different application we've actually

1374
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:22,190
a different application we've actually
 

1375
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,980
a different application we've actually
built the version called Aegis ashore

1376
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:23,990
built the version called Aegis ashore
 

1377
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,409
built the version called Aegis ashore
which is now deployed in a couple of

1378
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:26,419
which is now deployed in a couple of
 

1379
00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:28,659
which is now deployed in a couple of
places around the world so that same

1380
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:28,669
places around the world so that same
 

1381
00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:31,330
places around the world so that same
technology I mean basically it can be

1382
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:31,340
technology I mean basically it can be
 

1383
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:34,720
technology I mean basically it can be
used to protect either an ocean-going

1384
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:34,730
used to protect either an ocean-going
 

1385
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:36,450
used to protect either an ocean-going
fleet or a land-based

1386
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:36,460
fleet or a land-based
 

1387
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:40,520
fleet or a land-based
activity another one the Thad program

1388
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:40,530
activity another one the Thad program
 

1389
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:43,040
activity another one the Thad program
so Thad this is the theater high

1390
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,050
so Thad this is the theater high
 

1391
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:47,240
so Thad this is the theater high
altitude area defense this is to protect

1392
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:47,250
altitude area defense this is to protect
 

1393
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:50,590
altitude area defense this is to protect
you know relatively broad areas against

1394
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:50,600
you know relatively broad areas against
 

1395
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,390
you know relatively broad areas against
sophisticated ballistic missile threats

1396
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:53,400
sophisticated ballistic missile threats
 

1397
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:59,000
sophisticated ballistic missile threats
and so now you know it's deployed with a

1398
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,010
and so now you know it's deployed with a
 

1399
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:01,040
and so now you know it's deployed with a
lot of us capabilities and now we have

1400
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,050
lot of us capabilities and now we have
 

1401
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:03,140
lot of us capabilities and now we have
international customers that are looking

1402
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:03,150
international customers that are looking
 

1403
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,540
international customers that are looking
to buy that capability as well and so

1404
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:05,550
to buy that capability as well and so
 

1405
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:08,090
to buy that capability as well and so
these are systems that defend not just

1406
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:08,100
these are systems that defend not just
 

1407
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,920
these are systems that defend not just
defend militaries and military

1408
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:09,930
defend militaries and military
 

1409
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:13,240
defend militaries and military
capabilities but defend population areas

1410
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:13,250
capabilities but defend population areas
 

1411
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:16,730
capabilities but defend population areas
we saw you know maybe the first public

1412
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:16,740
we saw you know maybe the first public
 

1413
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,890
we saw you know maybe the first public
use of these back in the in the first

1414
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:18,900
use of these back in the in the first
 

1415
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,970
use of these back in the in the first
Gulf War with the Patriot systems and

1416
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:21,980
Gulf War with the Patriot systems and
 

1417
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,260
Gulf War with the Patriot systems and
these are these are the kinds of things

1418
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:24,270
these are these are the kinds of things
 

1419
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:27,410
these are these are the kinds of things
that Lockheed Martin delivers and

1420
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:27,420
that Lockheed Martin delivers and
 

1421
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,360
that Lockheed Martin delivers and
there's a lot of stuff that goes with it

1422
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:29,370
there's a lot of stuff that goes with it
 

1423
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,550
there's a lot of stuff that goes with it
so think about the radar systems and the

1424
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:31,560
so think about the radar systems and the
 

1425
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,420
so think about the radar systems and the
sensing systems that cue these the

1426
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:34,430
sensing systems that cue these the
 

1427
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:37,220
sensing systems that cue these the
command and control systems that decide

1428
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,230
command and control systems that decide
 

1429
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,770
command and control systems that decide
how you pair a weapon against an

1430
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:39,780
how you pair a weapon against an
 

1431
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:43,670
how you pair a weapon against an
incoming threat and then all the human

1432
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:43,680
incoming threat and then all the human
 

1433
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,100
incoming threat and then all the human
and machine interfaces to make sure that

1434
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:46,110
and machine interfaces to make sure that
 

1435
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,110
and machine interfaces to make sure that
they can be operated successfully in

1436
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:48,120
they can be operated successfully in
 

1437
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,620
they can be operated successfully in
very strenuous environments yeah there's

1438
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:51,630
very strenuous environments yeah there's
 

1439
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,770
very strenuous environments yeah there's
a there's some incredible engineering

1440
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:53,780
a there's some incredible engineering
 

1441
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,630
a there's some incredible engineering
that I never find like you but like you

1442
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:56,640
that I never find like you but like you
 

1443
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,460
that I never find like you but like you
said so maybe if we just take a look at

1444
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:00,470
said so maybe if we just take a look at
 

1445
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:04,130
said so maybe if we just take a look at
Lockheed history broadly maybe even

1446
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:04,140
Lockheed history broadly maybe even
 

1447
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,250
Lockheed history broadly maybe even
looking at skunk works what are the

1448
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:07,260
looking at skunk works what are the
 

1449
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,460
looking at skunk works what are the
biggest most impressive milestones of

1450
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:10,470
biggest most impressive milestones of
 

1451
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,340
biggest most impressive milestones of
innovations if you look at stealth I

1452
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:13,350
innovations if you look at stealth I
 

1453
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,200
innovations if you look at stealth I
would have called you crazy if you said

1454
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,210
would have called you crazy if you said
 

1455
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:18,460
would have called you crazy if you said
that's possible at the time and

1456
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:18,470
that's possible at the time and
 

1457
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:22,610
that's possible at the time and
supersonic and hypersonic so traveling

1458
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:22,620
supersonic and hypersonic so traveling
 

1459
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,650
supersonic and hypersonic so traveling
it first of all traveling at the speed

1460
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:24,660
it first of all traveling at the speed
 

1461
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,980
it first of all traveling at the speed
of sound is pretty damn fast and the

1462
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:27,990
of sound is pretty damn fast and the
 

1463
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:30,380
of sound is pretty damn fast and the
supersonic and hypersonic three four or

1464
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:30,390
supersonic and hypersonic three four or
 

1465
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,820
supersonic and hypersonic three four or
five times the speed of sound

1466
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:31,830
five times the speed of sound
 

1467
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:34,280
five times the speed of sound
that seems I would also call you crazy

1468
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:34,290
that seems I would also call you crazy
 

1469
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,110
that seems I would also call you crazy
if you say you can do that so can you

1470
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:36,120
if you say you can do that so can you
 

1471
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,540
if you say you can do that so can you
tell me how it's possible to do these

1472
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:38,550
tell me how it's possible to do these
 

1473
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,190
tell me how it's possible to do these
kinds of things and is there other

1474
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:40,200
kinds of things and is there other
 

1475
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,220
kinds of things and is there other
milestones and an innovation that's

1476
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:43,230
milestones and an innovation that's
 

1477
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:46,070
milestones and an innovation that's
going on you can talk about yeah well

1478
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:46,080
going on you can talk about yeah well
 

1479
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,260
going on you can talk about yeah well
let me start you know on the skunkworks

1480
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:48,270
let me start you know on the skunkworks
 

1481
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,780
let me start you know on the skunkworks
saga and you kind of alluded to it in

1482
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:50,790
saga and you kind of alluded to it in
 

1483
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:53,150
saga and you kind of alluded to it in
the beginning and skunk works is as much

1484
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:53,160
the beginning and skunk works is as much
 

1485
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,990
the beginning and skunk works is as much
idea as a place and so it's driven

1486
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:56,000
idea as a place and so it's driven
 

1487
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,390
idea as a place and so it's driven
really by Kelly Johnson's 14 principles

1488
00:32:59,390 --> 00:32:59,400
really by Kelly Johnson's 14 principles
 

1489
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,340
really by Kelly Johnson's 14 principles
and I'm not gonna list all 14 of them

1490
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:01,350
and I'm not gonna list all 14 of them
 

1491
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,950
and I'm not gonna list all 14 of them
off but the idea and this I'm sure will

1492
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:03,960
off but the idea and this I'm sure will
 

1493
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,080
off but the idea and this I'm sure will
resonate with any engineer who's worked

1494
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,090
resonate with any engineer who's worked
 

1495
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:08,529
resonate with any engineer who's worked
on a highly motivated small team before

1496
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:08,539
on a highly motivated small team before
 

1497
00:33:08,539 --> 00:33:11,419
on a highly motivated small team before
the idea that if you can essentially

1498
00:33:11,419 --> 00:33:11,429
the idea that if you can essentially
 

1499
00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:14,690
the idea that if you can essentially
have a small team of very capable

1500
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:14,700
have a small team of very capable
 

1501
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,390
have a small team of very capable
capable people who want to work on

1502
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:17,400
capable people who want to work on
 

1503
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,370
capable people who want to work on
really hard problems you can do almost

1504
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:19,380
really hard problems you can do almost
 

1505
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,580
really hard problems you can do almost
anything especially if you kind of

1506
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:22,590
anything especially if you kind of
 

1507
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:26,090
anything especially if you kind of
shield them from bureaucratic influences

1508
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:26,100
shield them from bureaucratic influences
 

1509
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,630
shield them from bureaucratic influences
if you create very tight relationships

1510
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:29,640
if you create very tight relationships
 

1511
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,279
if you create very tight relationships
with your customers so that you have

1512
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:31,289
with your customers so that you have
 

1513
00:33:31,289 --> 00:33:34,610
with your customers so that you have
that team and shared vision with the

1514
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:34,620
that team and shared vision with the
 

1515
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,190
that team and shared vision with the
customer those are the kinds of things

1516
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:37,200
customer those are the kinds of things
 

1517
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,880
customer those are the kinds of things
that enable the skunkworks to do these

1518
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:40,890
that enable the skunkworks to do these
 

1519
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:43,970
that enable the skunkworks to do these
these incredible things and you know we

1520
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:43,980
these incredible things and you know we
 

1521
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,289
these incredible things and you know we
listed off a number that you can you

1522
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:45,299
listed off a number that you can you
 

1523
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:47,330
listed off a number that you can you
brought up stuff and I mean this this

1524
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:47,340
brought up stuff and I mean this this
 

1525
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,640
brought up stuff and I mean this this
whole you know I wish I could have seen

1526
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:49,650
whole you know I wish I could have seen
 

1527
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,649
whole you know I wish I could have seen
been rich with a ball-bearing you know

1528
00:33:51,649 --> 00:33:51,659
been rich with a ball-bearing you know
 

1529
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:54,500
been rich with a ball-bearing you know
rolling across the desk to a general

1530
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:54,510
rolling across the desk to a general
 

1531
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,659
rolling across the desk to a general
officer and saying would you like to

1532
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:56,669
officer and saying would you like to
 

1533
00:33:56,669 --> 00:33:59,299
officer and saying would you like to
have an aircraft that has the radar

1534
00:33:59,299 --> 00:33:59,309
have an aircraft that has the radar
 

1535
00:33:59,309 --> 00:34:01,250
have an aircraft that has the radar
cross-section of this ball bearing

1536
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:01,260
cross-section of this ball bearing
 

1537
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,899
cross-section of this ball bearing
probably one of the great you know the

1538
00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:02,909
probably one of the great you know the
 

1539
00:34:02,909 --> 00:34:05,090
probably one of the great you know the
least expensive and most effective

1540
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:05,100
least expensive and most effective
 

1541
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,890
least expensive and most effective
marketing campaigns in the history of

00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:06,900
marketing campaigns in the history of
 

1543
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,159
marketing campaigns in the history of
the industry so just for people the not

1544
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:10,169
the industry so just for people the not
 

1545
00:34:10,169 --> 00:34:11,599
the industry so just for people the not
familiar I mean the way you detect

1546
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:11,609
familiar I mean the way you detect
 

1547
00:34:11,609 --> 00:34:13,580
familiar I mean the way you detect
aircraft does I mean I'm sure there's a

1548
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:13,590
aircraft does I mean I'm sure there's a
 

1549
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:16,760
aircraft does I mean I'm sure there's a
lot of ways but radar for a longest time

1550
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:16,770
lot of ways but radar for a longest time
 

1551
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:19,700
lot of ways but radar for a longest time
yeah there's a big blob they peers in

1552
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:19,710
yeah there's a big blob they peers in
 

1553
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,680
yeah there's a big blob they peers in
the radar how do you make a plane

1554
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:21,690
the radar how do you make a plane
 

1555
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:25,040
the radar how do you make a plane
disappear so it looks as big as a ball

1556
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,050
disappear so it looks as big as a ball
 

1557
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:27,230
disappear so it looks as big as a ball
bearing what's involved in technology

1558
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:27,240
bearing what's involved in technology
 

1559
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,050
bearing what's involved in technology
wise there what's the broadly sort of it

1560
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:30,060
wise there what's the broadly sort of it
 

1561
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,960
wise there what's the broadly sort of it
the stuff you speak about I'll stick to

1562
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:32,970
the stuff you speak about I'll stick to
 

1563
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,540
the stuff you speak about I'll stick to
what's in been Rich's but obviously the

1564
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:35,550
what's in been Rich's but obviously the
 

1565
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:38,570
what's in been Rich's but obviously the
geometry of how radar gets reflected and

1566
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:38,580
geometry of how radar gets reflected and
 

1567
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,760
geometry of how radar gets reflected and
the kinds of materials that either

1568
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:40,770
the kinds of materials that either
 

1569
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:44,180
the kinds of materials that either
reflect or absorb arcum kind of a couple

1570
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:44,190
reflect or absorb arcum kind of a couple
 

1571
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,790
reflect or absorb arcum kind of a couple
of the critical elements there I mean

1572
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:46,800
of the critical elements there I mean
 

1573
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,320
of the critical elements there I mean
it's a cat-and-mouse game right I mean

1574
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:48,330
it's a cat-and-mouse game right I mean
 

1575
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:51,590
it's a cat-and-mouse game right I mean
you know radars get better stealth

1576
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:51,600
you know radars get better stealth
 

1577
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,450
you know radars get better stealth
capabilities kids better and so it's a

1578
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:53,460
capabilities kids better and so it's a
 

1579
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,990
capabilities kids better and so it's a
it's a really game of continuous

1580
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:57,000
it's a really game of continuous
 

1581
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,550
it's a really game of continuous
improvement and innovation there I'll

1582
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:58,560
improvement and innovation there I'll
 

1583
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,790
improvement and innovation there I'll
leave it at that

1584
00:34:59,790 --> 00:34:59,800
leave it at that
 

1585
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,850
leave it at that
yeah so the idea that something is

1586
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:02,860
yeah so the idea that something is
 

1587
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,430
yeah so the idea that something is
essentially invisible it says quite

1588
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:05,440
essentially invisible it says quite
 

1589
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,100
essentially invisible it says quite
fascinating but the other one is flying

1590
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:08,110
fascinating but the other one is flying
 

1591
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:12,540
fascinating but the other one is flying
fast so speed of sound is 750 60 miles

1592
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:12,550
fast so speed of sound is 750 60 miles
 

1593
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:16,800
fast so speed of sound is 750 60 miles
an hour with this little SuperSonics 3

1594
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:16,810
an hour with this little SuperSonics 3
 

1595
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:19,650
an hour with this little SuperSonics 3
you know Mach 3 something like that yeah

1596
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:19,660
you know Mach 3 something like that yeah
 

1597
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,450
you know Mach 3 something like that yeah
we talked about the supersonic obviously

1598
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:21,460
we talked about the supersonic obviously
 

1599
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,490
we talked about the supersonic obviously
and we kind of talked about that is that

1600
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:23,500
and we kind of talked about that is that
 

1601
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,770
and we kind of talked about that is that
realm from Mach 1 up through about Mach

1602
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:25,780
realm from Mach 1 up through about Mach
 

1603
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:30,090
realm from Mach 1 up through about Mach
5 and then hypersonic so you know high

1604
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:30,100
5 and then hypersonic so you know high
 

1605
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,960
5 and then hypersonic so you know high
supersonic speeds would be past Mach 5

1606
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:33,970
supersonic speeds would be past Mach 5
 

1607
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:36,240
supersonic speeds would be past Mach 5
and you got to remember I know

1608
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:36,250
and you got to remember I know
 

1609
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,650
and you got to remember I know
Lockheed Martin and actually other

1610
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:37,660
Lockheed Martin and actually other
 

1611
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,120
Lockheed Martin and actually other
companies have been involved in

1612
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:39,130
companies have been involved in
 

1613
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:41,070
companies have been involved in
hypersonic development since the late

1614
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:41,080
hypersonic development since the late
 

1615
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,890
hypersonic development since the late
60s you know you think of everything

1616
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:43,900
60s you know you think of everything
 

1617
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,470
60s you know you think of everything
from the x-15 to the Space Shuttle as

1618
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:46,480
from the x-15 to the Space Shuttle as
 

1619
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,850
from the x-15 to the Space Shuttle as
examples of that I think the difference

1620
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:50,860
examples of that I think the difference
 

1621
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,840
examples of that I think the difference
now is if you look around the world

1622
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:53,850
now is if you look around the world
 

1623
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:56,700
now is if you look around the world
particularly the threat environment that

1624
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:56,710
particularly the threat environment that
 

1625
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,290
particularly the threat environment that
we're in today you're starting to see

1626
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:58,300
we're in today you're starting to see
 

1627
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:02,070
we're in today you're starting to see
you know publicly folks like the

1628
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:02,080
you know publicly folks like the
 

1629
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,040
you know publicly folks like the
Russians and the Chinese saying they

1630
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,050
Russians and the Chinese saying they
 

1631
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:08,460
Russians and the Chinese saying they
have hypersonic weapons capability that

1632
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:08,470
have hypersonic weapons capability that
 

1633
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:13,160
have hypersonic weapons capability that
could threaten us and allied

1634
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:13,170
could threaten us and allied
 

1635
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:16,470
could threaten us and allied
capabilities and also basically you know

1636
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:16,480
capabilities and also basically you know
 

1637
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,349
capabilities and also basically you know
the claims are these could get around

1638
00:36:18,349 --> 00:36:18,359
the claims are these could get around
 

1639
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:20,280
the claims are these could get around
defensive systems that are out there

1640
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:20,290
defensive systems that are out there
 

1641
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:24,060
defensive systems that are out there
today and so there's a real sense of

1642
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:24,070
today and so there's a real sense of
 

1643
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:26,660
today and so there's a real sense of
urgency you hear it from folks like the

1644
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:26,670
urgency you hear it from folks like the
 

1645
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,620
urgency you hear it from folks like the
Undersecretary of defense for research

1646
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:28,630
Undersecretary of defense for research
 

1647
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,420
Undersecretary of defense for research
and engineering dr. Mike Griffin and

1648
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:30,430
and engineering dr. Mike Griffin and
 

1649
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,940
and engineering dr. Mike Griffin and
others in the department of defense that

1650
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:32,950
others in the department of defense that
 

1651
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:36,030
others in the department of defense that
hypersonics is is something that's

1652
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:36,040
hypersonics is is something that's
 

1653
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,930
hypersonics is is something that's
really important to the nation

1654
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:38,940
really important to the nation
 

1655
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,330
really important to the nation
in terms of both parody but also

1656
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:41,340
in terms of both parody but also
 

1657
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:44,300
in terms of both parody but also
defensive capabilities and so that's

1658
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:44,310
defensive capabilities and so that's
 

1659
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:46,010
defensive capabilities and so that's
something that you know we're pleased

1660
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:46,020
something that you know we're pleased
 

1661
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,660
something that you know we're pleased
it's something Lockheed Martin's you

1662
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:47,670
it's something Lockheed Martin's you
 

1663
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:50,080
it's something Lockheed Martin's you
know had a heritage in we've invested

1664
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,090
know had a heritage in we've invested
 

1665
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:52,550
know had a heritage in we've invested
Hardie dollars on our side for many

1666
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:52,560
Hardie dollars on our side for many
 

1667
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,580
Hardie dollars on our side for many
years and we have a number of things

1668
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:55,590
years and we have a number of things
 

1669
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,770
years and we have a number of things
going on with various US government

1670
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:57,780
going on with various US government
 

1671
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,990
going on with various US government
customers in that field today that we're

1672
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,000
customers in that field today that we're
 

1673
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,450
customers in that field today that we're
very excited about so I I would

1674
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:02,460
very excited about so I I would
 

1675
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,860
very excited about so I I would
anticipate we'll be hearing more about

1676
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:03,870
anticipate we'll be hearing more about
 

1677
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,900
anticipate we'll be hearing more about
that in the future from our customers

1678
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:05,910
that in the future from our customers
 

1679
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,880
that in the future from our customers
and I've actually haven't read much

1680
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:07,890
and I've actually haven't read much
 

1681
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:10,010
and I've actually haven't read much
about this probably you can't talk about

1682
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:10,020
about this probably you can't talk about
 

1683
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,260
about this probably you can't talk about
much of it at all but on the defensive

1684
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:12,270
much of it at all but on the defensive
 

1685
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:14,120
much of it at all but on the defensive
side it's the fascinating problem of

1686
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:14,130
side it's the fascinating problem of
 

1687
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:16,640
side it's the fascinating problem of
perception of trying to detect things

1688
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:16,650
perception of trying to detect things
 

1689
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,590
perception of trying to detect things
that are really hard to see can you

1690
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:18,600
that are really hard to see can you
 

1691
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,990
that are really hard to see can you
comment on how hard that problem is and

1692
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:23,000
comment on how hard that problem is and
 

1693
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,110
comment on how hard that problem is and
how how hard is it to stay ahead even if

1694
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:27,120
how how hard is it to stay ahead even if
 

1695
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,630
how how hard is it to stay ahead even if
we go back a few decades stay ahead of

1696
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:29,640
we go back a few decades stay ahead of
 

1697
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,690
we go back a few decades stay ahead of
the competition well maybe I again you

1698
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:32,700
the competition well maybe I again you
 

1699
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,730
the competition well maybe I again you
got to think of these as ongoing the

1700
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:34,740
got to think of these as ongoing the
 

1701
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:38,570
got to think of these as ongoing the
capability development and so think back

1702
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:38,580
capability development and so think back
 

1703
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,850
capability development and so think back
to the early days of missile defense so

1704
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:40,860
to the early days of missile defense so
 

1705
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,970
to the early days of missile defense so
this would be in the 80s the SDI program

1706
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:42,980
this would be in the 80s the SDI program
 

1707
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:46,460
this would be in the 80s the SDI program
and in that timeframe we proved in

1708
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:46,470
and in that timeframe we proved in
 

1709
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,440
and in that timeframe we proved in
Lockheed Martin proof that you could hit

1710
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:48,450
Lockheed Martin proof that you could hit
 

1711
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:50,390
Lockheed Martin proof that you could hit
a bullet with a bullet essentially and

1712
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:50,400
a bullet with a bullet essentially and
 

1713
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,520
a bullet with a bullet essentially and
which is something that had never been

1714
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:52,530
which is something that had never been
 

1715
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:54,440
which is something that had never been
done before to take out an incoming

1716
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:54,450
done before to take out an incoming
 

1717
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:57,170
done before to take out an incoming
ballistic missile and so that's led to

1718
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:57,180
ballistic missile and so that's led to
 

1719
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,720
ballistic missile and so that's led to
these incredible hit-to-kill kinds of

1720
00:37:59,720 --> 00:37:59,730
these incredible hit-to-kill kinds of
 

1721
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:03,920
these incredible hit-to-kill kinds of
capabilities pac-3 that's the Patriot

1722
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:03,930
capabilities pac-3 that's the Patriot
 

1723
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:07,460
capabilities pac-3 that's the Patriot
advanced capability model 3 the Lockheed

1724
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:07,470
advanced capability model 3 the Lockheed
 

1725
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,080
advanced capability model 3 the Lockheed
Martin builds the THAAD system that I

1726
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:09,090
Martin builds the THAAD system that I
 

1727
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:11,660
Martin builds the THAAD system that I
that I talked about

1728
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:11,670
that I talked about
 

1729
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:15,860
that I talked about
so now hypersonics you know they're

1730
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:15,870
so now hypersonics you know they're
 

1731
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,780
so now hypersonics you know they're
different from ballistic systems and so

1732
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:17,790
different from ballistic systems and so
 

1733
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,550
different from ballistic systems and so
we got to take the next step in

1734
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:19,560
we got to take the next step in
 

1735
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,840
we got to take the next step in
defensive capability I can leave that

1736
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:23,850
defensive capability I can leave that
 

1737
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:26,600
defensive capability I can leave that
there but I can only imagine you know

1738
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:26,610
there but I can only imagine you know
 

1739

there but I can only imagine you know
let me just comment sort of Resident

1740
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:28,380
let me just comment sort of Resident
 

1741
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:32,060
let me just comment sort of Resident
Engineer it's sad to know that so much

1742
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:32,070
Engineer it's sad to know that so much
 

1743
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:35,560
Engineer it's sad to know that so much
that Lockheed has done in the past is

1744
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:35,570
that Lockheed has done in the past is
 

1745
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:39,170
that Lockheed has done in the past is
classified or today you know and it's

1746
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:39,180
classified or today you know and it's
 

1747
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:42,740
classified or today you know and it's
shrouded in secrecy it has to be by the

1748
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:42,750
shrouded in secrecy it has to be by the
 

1749
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:47,180
shrouded in secrecy it has to be by the
nature of the application so like what I

1750
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:47,190
nature of the application so like what I
 

1751
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,280
nature of the application so like what I
do so we what we do here at MIT would

1752
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:49,290
do so we what we do here at MIT would
 

1753
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:50,910
do so we what we do here at MIT would
like to inspire young

1754
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:50,920
like to inspire young
 

1755
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:55,530
like to inspire young
years young scientists and yet in a

1756
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:55,540
years young scientists and yet in a
 

1757
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,599
years young scientists and yet in a
lucky case some of that engineering has

1758
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:57,609
lucky case some of that engineering has
 

1759
00:38:57,609 --> 00:39:00,510
lucky case some of that engineering has
to stay quiet how do you think about

1760
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:00,520
to stay quiet how do you think about
 

1761
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,160
to stay quiet how do you think about
that how does that make you feel is

1762
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:02,170
that how does that make you feel is
 

1763
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:07,380
that how does that make you feel is
there a future where more can be shown

1764
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:07,390
there a future where more can be shown
 

1765
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:10,680
there a future where more can be shown
or is it just the nature the nature of

1766
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:10,690
or is it just the nature the nature of
 

1767
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,710
or is it just the nature the nature of
this world that has to remain secret

1768
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:12,720
this world that has to remain secret
 

1769
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:18,720
this world that has to remain secret
it's a good question I think the public

1770
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:18,730
it's a good question I think the public
 

1771
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:23,789
it's a good question I think the public
can see enough of including students who

1772
00:39:23,789 --> 00:39:23,799
can see enough of including students who
 

1773
00:39:23,799 --> 00:39:26,069
can see enough of including students who
may be in grade school high school

1774
00:39:26,069 --> 00:39:26,079
may be in grade school high school
 

1775
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,480
may be in grade school high school
college today to understand the kinds of

1776
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:30,490
college today to understand the kinds of
 

1777
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:33,829
college today to understand the kinds of
really hard problems that we work on and

1778
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:33,839
really hard problems that we work on and
 

1779
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:37,650
really hard problems that we work on and
I mean look at the f-35 right and you

1780
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:37,660
I mean look at the f-35 right and you
 

1781
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,480
I mean look at the f-35 right and you
know obviously a lot of the detailed

1782
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:39,490
know obviously a lot of the detailed
 

1783
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:42,569
know obviously a lot of the detailed
performance levels are sensitive and

1784
00:39:42,569 --> 00:39:42,579
performance levels are sensitive and
 

1785
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:45,839
performance levels are sensitive and
control but you know we can talk about

1786
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:45,849
control but you know we can talk about
 

1787
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:48,450
control but you know we can talk about
what an incredible aircraft this is you

1788
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:48,460
what an incredible aircraft this is you
 

1789
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:50,520
what an incredible aircraft this is you
know supersonic super cruise kind of a

1790
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:50,530
know supersonic super cruise kind of a
 

1791
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:53,910
know supersonic super cruise kind of a
fighter a a you know stealth

1792
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:53,920
fighter a a you know stealth
 

1793
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,059
fighter a a you know stealth
capabilities it's a flying information

1794
00:39:57,059 --> 00:39:57,069
capabilities it's a flying information
 

1795
00:39:57,069 --> 00:39:59,670
capabilities it's a flying information
you know system in the sky with data

1796
00:39:59,670 --> 00:39:59,680
you know system in the sky with data
 

1797
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,160
you know system in the sky with data
fusion sensor fusion capabilities that

1798
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:02,170
fusion sensor fusion capabilities that
 

1799
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,390
fusion sensor fusion capabilities that
have never been seen before

1800
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:03,400
have never been seen before
 

1801
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,069
have never been seen before
so these are the kinds of things that I

1802
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:05,079
so these are the kinds of things that I
 

1803
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:06,359
so these are the kinds of things that I
believe you know there was these are

1804
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:06,369
believe you know there was these are
 

1805
00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:08,099
believe you know there was these are
kinds of things that got me excited when

1806
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:08,109
kinds of things that got me excited when
 

1807
00:40:08,109 --> 00:40:09,720
kinds of things that got me excited when
I was a student I think these still

1808
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:09,730
I was a student I think these still
 

1809
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:12,990
I was a student I think these still
inspire students today and the other

1810
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:13,000
inspire students today and the other
 

1811
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,390
inspire students today and the other
thing and say I mean you know people are

1812
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:15,400
thing and say I mean you know people are
 

1813
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,240
thing and say I mean you know people are
inspired by space people are inspired by

1814
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:18,250
inspired by space people are inspired by
 

1815
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:23,700
inspired by space people are inspired by
aircraft our employees are also inspired

1816
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:23,710
aircraft our employees are also inspired
 

1817
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:26,549
aircraft our employees are also inspired
by that sense of mission and I will just

1818
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:26,559
by that sense of mission and I will just
 

1819
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:29,309
by that sense of mission and I will just
give you an example I had the privilege

1820
00:40:29,309 --> 00:40:29,319
give you an example I had the privilege
 

1821
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:32,789
give you an example I had the privilege
to work and lead our GPS programs for

1822
00:40:32,789 --> 00:40:32,799
to work and lead our GPS programs for
 

1823
00:40:32,799 --> 00:40:36,770
to work and lead our GPS programs for
some time and that was a case where he

1824
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:36,780
some time and that was a case where he
 

1825
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,299
some time and that was a case where he
actually worked on a program that

1826
00:40:39,299 --> 00:40:39,309
actually worked on a program that
 

1827
00:40:39,309 --> 00:40:41,549
actually worked on a program that
touches billions of people every day and

1828
00:40:41,549 --> 00:40:41,559
touches billions of people every day and
 

1829
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:43,920
touches billions of people every day and
so when I said I worked on GPS everybody

1830
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:43,930
so when I said I worked on GPS everybody
 

1831
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:45,450
so when I said I worked on GPS everybody
knew what I was talking about even

1832
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:45,460
knew what I was talking about even
 

1833
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,950
knew what I was talking about even
though they didn't maybe appreciate the

1834
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:46,960
though they didn't maybe appreciate the
 

1835
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,569
though they didn't maybe appreciate the
technical challenges that went into that

1836
00:40:50,569 --> 00:40:50,579
technical challenges that went into that
 

1837
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:54,599
technical challenges that went into that
but I'll tell you I got a briefing one

1838
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:54,609
but I'll tell you I got a briefing one
 

1839
00:40:54,609 --> 00:40:57,349
but I'll tell you I got a briefing one
time from a major in the Air Force

1840
00:40:57,349 --> 00:40:57,359
time from a major in the Air Force
 

1841
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:02,569
time from a major in the Air Force
and he said I go by callsign [\h__\h] GPS is

1842
00:41:02,569 --> 00:41:02,579
and he said I go by callsign [\h__\h] GPS is
 

1843
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:05,989
and he said I go by callsign [\h__\h] GPS is
my passion yeah I love GPS and he was

1844
00:41:05,989 --> 00:41:05,999
my passion yeah I love GPS and he was
 

1845
00:41:05,999 --> 00:41:07,940
my passion yeah I love GPS and he was
involved in the operational test of the

1846
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:07,950
involved in the operational test of the
 

1847
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:11,239
involved in the operational test of the
system he said when I was out in Iraq

1848
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:11,249
system he said when I was out in Iraq
 

1849
00:41:11,249 --> 00:41:15,019
system he said when I was out in Iraq
and I was on a helicopter Black Hawk

1850
00:41:15,019 --> 00:41:15,029
and I was on a helicopter Black Hawk
 

1851
00:41:15,029 --> 00:41:19,009
and I was on a helicopter Black Hawk
helicopter and it was bringing back you

1852
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:19,019
helicopter and it was bringing back you
 

1853
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:21,680
helicopter and it was bringing back you
know sergeant and handful of troops from

1854
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:21,690
know sergeant and handful of troops from
 

1855
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:25,220
know sergeant and handful of troops from
a deployed location and I you know I

1856
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:25,230
a deployed location and I you know I
 

1857
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:27,829
a deployed location and I you know I
said my job is GPS I asked that sergeant

1858
00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:27,839
said my job is GPS I asked that sergeant
 

1859
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,690
said my job is GPS I asked that sergeant
he's you know beaten down and kind of

1860
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:29,700
he's you know beaten down and kind of
 

1861
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,049
he's you know beaten down and kind of
half asleep and I said what do you think

1862
00:41:33,049 --> 00:41:33,059
half asleep and I said what do you think
 

1863
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:35,390
half asleep and I said what do you think
about GPS and he brightened up his eyes

1864
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:35,400
about GPS and he brightened up his eyes
 

1865
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,059
about GPS and he brightened up his eyes
lit up and he said well GPS that brings

1866
00:41:38,059 --> 00:41:38,069
lit up and he said well GPS that brings
 

1867
00:41:38,069 --> 00:41:39,920
lit up and he said well GPS that brings
me and my troops home every day

1868
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:39,930
me and my troops home every day
 

1869
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,229
me and my troops home every day
I love GPS and that's the kind of story

1870
00:41:42,229 --> 00:41:42,239
I love GPS and that's the kind of story
 

1871
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:44,660
I love GPS and that's the kind of story
where it's like okay I'm really making a

1872
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:44,670
where it's like okay I'm really making a
 

1873
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,609
where it's like okay I'm really making a
difference here in the kind of work so

1874
00:41:46,609 --> 00:41:46,619
difference here in the kind of work so
 

1875
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:48,170
difference here in the kind of work so
that that mission piece is really

1876
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:48,180
that that mission piece is really
 

1877
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,819
that that mission piece is really
important the last thing I'll say is

1878
00:41:49,819 --> 00:41:49,829
important the last thing I'll say is
 

1879
00:41:49,829 --> 00:41:53,029
important the last thing I'll say is
that and this gets to some of these

1880
00:41:53,029 --> 00:41:53,039
that and this gets to some of these
 

1881
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:55,549
that and this gets to some of these
questions around advanced technologies

1882
00:41:55,549 --> 00:41:55,559
questions around advanced technologies
 

1883
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:57,920
questions around advanced technologies
it's not you know they're not just

1884
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:57,930
it's not you know they're not just
 

1885
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:00,140
it's not you know they're not just
airplanes and spacecraft anymore for

1886
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:00,150
airplanes and spacecraft anymore for
 

1887
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,239
airplanes and spacecraft anymore for
people who are excited about advanced

1888
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:02,249
people who are excited about advanced
 

1889
00:42:02,249 --> 00:42:05,059
people who are excited about advanced
software capabilities about AI about

1890
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:05,069
software capabilities about AI about
 

1891
00:42:05,069 --> 00:42:07,579
software capabilities about AI about
bringing machine learn the things that

1892
00:42:07,579 --> 00:42:07,589
bringing machine learn the things that
 

1893
00:42:07,589 --> 00:42:10,099
bringing machine learn the things that
we're doing to you know exponentially

1894
00:42:10,099 --> 00:42:10,109
we're doing to you know exponentially
 

1895
00:42:10,109 --> 00:42:13,099
we're doing to you know exponentially
increase the mission capabilities that

1896
00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:13,109
increase the mission capabilities that
 

1897
00:42:13,109 --> 00:42:14,870
increase the mission capabilities that
go on those platforms and those are the

1898
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:14,880
go on those platforms and those are the
 

1899
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,519
go on those platforms and those are the
kinds of things I think are more and

1900
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:16,529
kinds of things I think are more and
 

1901
00:42:16,529 --> 00:42:18,789
kinds of things I think are more and
more visible to the public yeah I think

1902
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:18,799
more visible to the public yeah I think
 

1903
00:42:18,799 --> 00:42:22,130
more visible to the public yeah I think
autonomy especially in flight is super

1904
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:22,140
autonomy especially in flight is super
 

1905
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,640
autonomy especially in flight is super
exciting do you do you see if a day here

1906
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:25,650
exciting do you do you see if a day here
 

1907
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:28,670
exciting do you do you see if a day here
we go back into philosophy future when

1908
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:28,680
we go back into philosophy future when
 

1909
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:34,099
we go back into philosophy future when
most fighter jets will be highly

1910
00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:34,109
most fighter jets will be highly
 

1911
00:42:34,109 --> 00:42:36,979
most fighter jets will be highly
autonomous to a degree where a human

1912
00:42:36,979 --> 00:42:36,989
autonomous to a degree where a human
 

1913
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:39,049
autonomous to a degree where a human
doesn't need to be in the cockpit in

1914
00:42:39,049 --> 00:42:39,059
doesn't need to be in the cockpit in
 

1915
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:41,930
doesn't need to be in the cockpit in
almost all cases well I mean that's a

1916
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:41,940
almost all cases well I mean that's a
 

1917
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,789
almost all cases well I mean that's a
world that to a certain extent we're in

1918
00:42:43,789 --> 00:42:43,799
world that to a certain extent we're in
 

1919
00:42:43,799 --> 00:42:46,009
world that to a certain extent we're in
today now these are remotely piloted

1920
00:42:46,009 --> 00:42:46,019
today now these are remotely piloted
 

1921
00:42:46,019 --> 00:42:49,999
today now these are remotely piloted
aircraft to be sure but but we have

1922
00:42:49,999 --> 00:42:50,009
aircraft to be sure but but we have
 

1923
00:42:50,009 --> 00:42:52,370
aircraft to be sure but but we have
hundreds of thousands of flight hours a

1924
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:52,380
hundreds of thousands of flight hours a
 

1925
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:55,329
hundreds of thousands of flight hours a
year now in remotely piloted aircraft

1926
00:42:55,329 --> 00:42:55,339
year now in remotely piloted aircraft
 

1927
00:42:55,339 --> 00:43:00,200
year now in remotely piloted aircraft
and then if you take the f-35 there I

1928
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:00,210
and then if you take the f-35 there I
 

1929
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:03,620
and then if you take the f-35 there I
mean there are huge layers I guess in

1930
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:03,630
mean there are huge layers I guess in
 

1931
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:05,180
mean there are huge layers I guess in
levels of autonomy built into that

1932
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:05,190
levels of autonomy built into that
 

1933
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:06,080
levels of autonomy built into that
aircraft

1934
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:06,090
aircraft
 

1935
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:10,340
aircraft
so that the pilot is essentially more of

1936
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:10,350
so that the pilot is essentially more of
 

1937
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:13,340
so that the pilot is essentially more of
a mission manager rather than doing the

1938
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:13,350
a mission manager rather than doing the
 

1939
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:16,130
a mission manager rather than doing the
data you know the second second elements

1940
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:16,140
data you know the second second elements
 

1941
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,020
data you know the second second elements
of flying the aircrafts on in some ways

1942
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:18,030
of flying the aircrafts on in some ways
 

1943
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:19,850
of flying the aircrafts on in some ways
it's the easiest aircraft in the world

1944
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:19,860
it's the easiest aircraft in the world
 

1945
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:22,280
it's the easiest aircraft in the world
to fly and kind of funny story on that

1946
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:22,290
to fly and kind of funny story on that
 

1947
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:25,400
to fly and kind of funny story on that
so I don't know if you know how aircraft

1948
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:25,410
so I don't know if you know how aircraft
 

1949
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:28,540
so I don't know if you know how aircraft
carrier landings work but basically

1950
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:28,550
carrier landings work but basically
 

1951
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:31,130
carrier landings work but basically
there's what's called a tail hook and it

1952
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:31,140
there's what's called a tail hook and it
 

1953
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,620
there's what's called a tail hook and it
catches wires on the deck of the carrier

1954
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:33,630
catches wires on the deck of the carrier
 

1955
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:36,980
catches wires on the deck of the carrier
and that's what brings the the aircraft

1956
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:36,990
and that's what brings the the aircraft
 

1957
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:40,370
and that's what brings the the aircraft
to a screeching halt Britain and there's

1958
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:40,380
to a screeching halt Britain and there's
 

1959
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,140
to a screeching halt Britain and there's
typically three of these wires so if you

1960
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:42,150
typically three of these wires so if you
 

1961
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:43,880
typically three of these wires so if you
miss the first the second one you catch

1962
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:43,890
miss the first the second one you catch
 

1963
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:48,020
miss the first the second one you catch
the the next one right and you know we

1964
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:48,030
the the next one right and you know we
 

1965
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:50,030
the the next one right and you know we
got a little criticism I don't know how

1966
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:50,040
got a little criticism I don't know how
 

1967
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,470
got a little criticism I don't know how
true this story is what we got a little

1968
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:51,480
true this story is what we got a little
 

1969
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,530
true this story is what we got a little
criticism the f-35 is so perfect it

1970
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:54,540
criticism the f-35 is so perfect it
 

1971
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,360
criticism the f-35 is so perfect it
always gets the second wires we're

1972
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:56,370
always gets the second wires we're
 

1973
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:59,210
always gets the second wires we're
wearing out the wire I guess it always

1974
00:43:59,210 --> 00:43:59,220
wearing out the wire I guess it always
 

1975
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,310
wearing out the wire I guess it always
hits that one so that but that's the

1976
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:01,320
hits that one so that but that's the
 

1977
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,770
hits that one so that but that's the
kind of autonomy that just makes these

1978
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:03,780
kind of autonomy that just makes these
 

1979
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:06,110
kind of autonomy that just makes these
that essentially up levels what the

1980
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:06,120
that essentially up levels what the
 

1981
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,000
that essentially up levels what the
human is doing two more that mission

1982
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,010
human is doing two more that mission
 

1983
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:09,860
human is doing two more that mission
managers so much of that landing by that

1984
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:09,870
managers so much of that landing by that
 

1985
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:12,590
managers so much of that landing by that
thirty-five is autonomous well it's just

1986
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:12,600
thirty-five is autonomous well it's just
 

1987
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,330
thirty-five is autonomous well it's just
you know the control systems are such

1988
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:14,340
you know the control systems are such
 

1989
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:16,010
you know the control systems are such
that you really have dialed out the

1990
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:16,020
that you really have dialed out the
 

1991
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,620
that you really have dialed out the
variability and what that comes with all

1992
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:18,630
variability and what that comes with all
 

1993
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:20,180
variability and what that comes with all
the environmental condition wearing it

1994
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:20,190
the environmental condition wearing it
 

1995
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:24,020
the environmental condition wearing it
out so my point is to certain extent

1996
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:24,030
out so my point is to certain extent
 

1997
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:27,980
out so my point is to certain extent
that world is here today do I think that

1998
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:27,990
that world is here today do I think that
 

1999
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:30,140
that world is here today do I think that
we're gonna see a day anytime soon when

2000
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:30,150
we're gonna see a day anytime soon when
 

2001
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:31,940
we're gonna see a day anytime soon when
there are no humans in the cockpit I

2002
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:31,950
there are no humans in the cockpit I
 

2003
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:34,340
there are no humans in the cockpit I
don't believe that but I do think we're

2004
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:34,350
don't believe that but I do think we're
 

2005
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:36,590
don't believe that but I do think we're
gonna see much more human machine

2006
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:36,600
gonna see much more human machine
 

2007
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,330
gonna see much more human machine
teaming and we're gonna see that much

2008
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:38,340
teaming and we're gonna see that much
 

2009
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,060
teaming and we're gonna see that much
more at the tactical edge and we did a

2010
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:41,070
more at the tactical edge and we did a
 

2011
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:42,590
more at the tactical edge and we did a
demo you asked about what the skunkworks

2012
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:42,600
demo you asked about what the skunkworks
 

2013
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,420
demo you asked about what the skunkworks
is doing these days and so this is what

2014
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:44,430
is doing these days and so this is what
 

2015
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:46,700
is doing these days and so this is what
something I can talk about but we did a

2016
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:46,710
something I can talk about but we did a
 

2017
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:48,680
something I can talk about but we did a
demo with the Air Force Research

2018
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:48,690
demo with the Air Force Research
 

2019
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:51,710
demo with the Air Force Research
Laboratory or laboratory we called it

2020
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:51,720
Laboratory or laboratory we called it
 

2021
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:56,000
Laboratory or laboratory we called it
have Rader and so using an f-16

2022
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,010
have Rader and so using an f-16
 

2023
00:44:56,010 --> 00:45:00,290
have Rader and so using an f-16
as an autonomous wingman and we

2024
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:00,300
as an autonomous wingman and we
 

2025
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,660
as an autonomous wingman and we
demonstrated all kinds of maneuvers and

2026
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:02,670
demonstrated all kinds of maneuvers and
 

2027
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:04,790
demonstrated all kinds of maneuvers and
verus mission scenarios with the

2028
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:04,800
verus mission scenarios with the
 

2029
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,340
verus mission scenarios with the
autonomous f-16 being that so-called

2030
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:07,350
autonomous f-16 being that so-called
 

2031
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:10,190
autonomous f-16 being that so-called
loyal or trusted wingman and so those

2032
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:10,200
loyal or trusted wingman and so those
 

2033
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,080
loyal or trusted wingman and so those
are the kinds of things that you know

2034
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,090
are the kinds of things that you know
 

2035
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:15,890
are the kinds of things that you know
we've shown what is possible now given

2036
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:15,900
we've shown what is possible now given
 

2037
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,110
we've shown what is possible now given
that you've up leveled that pilot to be

2038
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:18,120
that you've up leveled that pilot to be
 

2039
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,240
that you've up leveled that pilot to be
a mission manager now they can control

2040
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:20,250
a mission manager now they can control
 

2041
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,940
a mission manager now they can control
multiple other aircraft they can almost

2042
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:22,950
multiple other aircraft they can almost
 

2043
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:24,920
multiple other aircraft they can almost
as extensions of your own aircraft

2044
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:24,930
as extensions of your own aircraft
 

2045
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:27,530
as extensions of your own aircraft
flying alongside with you so that's

2046
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:27,540
flying alongside with you so that's
 

2047
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,660
flying alongside with you so that's
that's another example of how this is

2048
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:29,670
that's another example of how this is
 

2049
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:33,290
that's another example of how this is
really coming to fruition and then yeah

2050
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:33,300
really coming to fruition and then yeah
 

2051
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:36,320
really coming to fruition and then yeah
I mentioned the the landings but think

2052
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:36,330
I mentioned the the landings but think
 

2053
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:39,020
I mentioned the the landings but think
about just the implications for humans

2054
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:39,030
about just the implications for humans
 

2055
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:40,520
about just the implications for humans
and flight safety and this goes a little

2056
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:40,530
and flight safety and this goes a little
 

2057
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:42,050
and flight safety and this goes a little
bit back to the discussion we were

2058
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:42,060
bit back to the discussion we were
 

2059
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:44,480
bit back to the discussion we were
having about how do you continuously

2060
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:44,490
having about how do you continuously
 

2061
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:48,080
having about how do you continuously
improve the level of safety through

2062
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:48,090
improve the level of safety through
 

2063
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:50,360
improve the level of safety through
automation while working through the

2064
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:50,370
automation while working through the
 

2065
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:52,790
automation while working through the
complexities that Automation introduces

2066
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:52,800
complexities that Automation introduces
 

2067
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,680
complexities that Automation introduces
so one of the challenges that you have

2068
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:54,690
so one of the challenges that you have
 

2069
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:56,450
so one of the challenges that you have
in high-performance fighter aircraft is

2070
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:56,460
in high-performance fighter aircraft is
 

2071
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,130
in high-performance fighter aircraft is
what's called G lock so this is G

2072
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:58,140
what's called G lock so this is G
 

2073
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:00,140
what's called G lock so this is G
induced loss of consciousness so you

2074
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:00,150
induced loss of consciousness so you
 

2075
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:02,390
induced loss of consciousness so you
pull 9 G's you're wearing a pressure

2076
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:02,400
pull 9 G's you're wearing a pressure
 

2077
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,340
pull 9 G's you're wearing a pressure
suit that's not enough to keep the blood

2078
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:04,350
suit that's not enough to keep the blood
 

2079
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:06,620
suit that's not enough to keep the blood
going to your brain you have a blackout

2080
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:06,630
going to your brain you have a blackout
 

2081
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:09,710
going to your brain you have a blackout
right right and of course that's bad if

2082
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:09,720
right right and of course that's bad if
 

2083
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,140
right right and of course that's bad if
you happen to be flying low you know

2084
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:12,150
you happen to be flying low you know
 

2085
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:14,360
you happen to be flying low you know
near the deck and you know earng

2086
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:14,370
near the deck and you know earng
 

2087
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:18,110
near the deck and you know earng
obstacle or terrain environment and so

2088
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:18,120
obstacle or terrain environment and so
 

2089
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,570
obstacle or terrain environment and so
we developed the system and our

2090
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:20,580
we developed the system and our
 

2091
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:23,930
we developed the system and our
Aeronautics division called Auto G caso

2092
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:23,940
Aeronautics division called Auto G caso
 

2093
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,970
Aeronautics division called Auto G caso
autonomous ground collision avoidance

2094
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:25,980
autonomous ground collision avoidance
 

2095
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:29,990
autonomous ground collision avoidance
system and we built that into the f-16

2096
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:30,000
system and we built that into the f-16
 

2097
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,970
system and we built that into the f-16
it's actually saved seven aircraft eight

2098
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:31,980
it's actually saved seven aircraft eight
 

2099
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,280
it's actually saved seven aircraft eight
pilots already and a relatively short

2100
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:34,290
pilots already and a relatively short
 

2101
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:36,200
pilots already and a relatively short
time it's been deployed it was so

2102
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:36,210
time it's been deployed it was so
 

2103
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:39,380
time it's been deployed it was so
successful that the Air Force said hey

2104
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:39,390
successful that the Air Force said hey
 

2105
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:41,210
successful that the Air Force said hey
we need to have this in the f-35 right

2106
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:41,220
we need to have this in the f-35 right
 

2107
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:43,550
we need to have this in the f-35 right
away so we've actually gone done testing

2108
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:43,560
away so we've actually gone done testing
 

2109
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,880
away so we've actually gone done testing
and that now on the f-35 and we've also

2110
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:46,890
and that now on the f-35 and we've also
 

2111
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:50,180
and that now on the f-35 and we've also
integrated an autonomous air collision

2112
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:50,190
integrated an autonomous air collision
 

2113
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:51,470
integrated an autonomous air collision
avoidance system so I think the

2114
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:51,480
avoidance system so I think the
 

2115
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,390
avoidance system so I think the
air-to-air problem so now it's the

2116
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:53,400
air-to-air problem so now it's the
 

2117
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,640
air-to-air problem so now it's the
integrated collision avoidance system

2118
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:55,650
integrated collision avoidance system
 

2119
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,700
integrated collision avoidance system
but these are the kinds of capabilities

2120
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:57,710
but these are the kinds of capabilities
 

2121
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:59,780
but these are the kinds of capabilities
you know I wouldn't call them a high I

2122
00:46:59,780 --> 00:46:59,790
you know I wouldn't call them a high I
 

2123
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:02,690
you know I wouldn't call them a high I
mean they're very sophisticated models

2124
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:02,700
mean they're very sophisticated models
 

2125
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:05,680
mean they're very sophisticated models
you know of the aircraft dynamics

2126
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:05,690
you know of the aircraft dynamics
 

2127
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:08,330
you know of the aircraft dynamics
coupled with the terrain models to be

2128
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:08,340
coupled with the terrain models to be
 

2129
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:11,690
coupled with the terrain models to be
able to predict when essentially the

2130
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:11,700
able to predict when essentially the
 

2131
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,670
able to predict when essentially the
pilot is doing something that is going

2132
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:13,680
pilot is doing something that is going
 

2133
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,560
pilot is doing something that is going
to take the aircraft into or the pilots

2134
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:15,570
to take the aircraft into or the pilots
 

2135
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:18,290
to take the aircraft into or the pilots
not doing something in this case but

2136
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:18,300
not doing something in this case but
 

2137
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,240
not doing something in this case but
those it just gives you an example of

2138
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:20,250
those it just gives you an example of
 

2139
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:23,930
those it just gives you an example of
how autonomy can be really a lifesaver

2140
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:23,940
how autonomy can be really a lifesaver
 

2141
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:27,050
how autonomy can be really a lifesaver
in today's world it's like a autonomous

2142
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:27,060
in today's world it's like a autonomous
 

2143
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:29,630
in today's world it's like a autonomous
emerges automated emergency braking in

2144
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:29,640
emerges automated emergency braking in
 

2145
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:33,260
emerges automated emergency braking in
cars but is there any exploration of

2146
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:33,270
cars but is there any exploration of
 

2147
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:36,740
cars but is there any exploration of
perception of for example detecting G

2148
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:36,750
perception of for example detecting G
 

2149
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:39,920
perception of for example detecting G
lock that the pilot has is out so as

2150
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:39,930
lock that the pilot has is out so as
 

2151
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:42,440
lock that the pilot has is out so as
opposed to perceiving the external

2152
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:42,450
opposed to perceiving the external
 

2153
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:44,210
opposed to perceiving the external
environment to infer that the pilot is

2154
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:44,220
environment to infer that the pilot is
 

2155
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,340
environment to infer that the pilot is
out but actually perceiving the Pala

2156
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:46,350
out but actually perceiving the Pala
 

2157
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:48,380
out but actually perceiving the Pala
directly yeah this is one of those cases

2158
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:48,390
directly yeah this is one of those cases
 

2159
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:50,330
directly yeah this is one of those cases
where you'd like to you know not take

2160
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:50,340
where you'd like to you know not take
 

2161
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:52,190
where you'd like to you know not take
action if you think the pilots there and

2162
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:52,200
action if you think the pilots there and
 

2163
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,170
action if you think the pilots there and
it's almost like systems that try to

2164
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:54,180
it's almost like systems that try to
 

2165
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,450
it's almost like systems that try to
detect if a drivers falling asleep on

2166
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:56,460
detect if a drivers falling asleep on
 

2167
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:00,650
detect if a drivers falling asleep on
the road right with limited success so I

2168
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:00,660
the road right with limited success so I
 

2169
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,660
the road right with limited success so I
mean this is what I call the system of

2170
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:02,670
mean this is what I call the system of
 

2171
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:04,790
mean this is what I call the system of
last resort right where if the if the

2172
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:04,800
last resort right where if the if the
 

2173
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,150
last resort right where if the if the
aircraft has determined that it's going

2174
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:08,160
aircraft has determined that it's going
 

2175
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,110
aircraft has determined that it's going
into the terrain

2176
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:09,120
into the terrain
 

2177
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,080
into the terrain
get it out of there and and this is not

2178
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:12,090
get it out of there and and this is not
 

2179
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:14,000
get it out of there and and this is not
something that we're just doing in the

2180
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:14,010
something that we're just doing in the
 

2181
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:16,190
something that we're just doing in the
in the aircraft world and I wanted to

2182
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:16,200
in the aircraft world and I wanted to
 

2183
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,020
in the aircraft world and I wanted to
highlight we have a technology we call

2184
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:18,030
highlight we have a technology we call
 

2185
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:20,660
highlight we have a technology we call
matrix but this is developed at sikorsky

2186
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:20,670
matrix but this is developed at sikorsky
 

2187
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:23,900
matrix but this is developed at sikorsky
innovations the whole idea there is what

2188
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:23,910
innovations the whole idea there is what
 

2189
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:28,190
innovations the whole idea there is what
we call optimal piloting so not optional

2190
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:28,200
we call optimal piloting so not optional
 

2191
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,220
we call optimal piloting so not optional
piloting or unpiloted but optimal

2192
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:31,230
piloting or unpiloted but optimal
 

2193
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:35,330
piloting or unpiloted but optimal
piloting so an FAA certified system so

2194
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:35,340
piloting so an FAA certified system so
 

2195
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,190
piloting so an FAA certified system so
you have a high degree of confidence

2196
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:37,200
you have a high degree of confidence
 

2197
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,790
you have a high degree of confidence
it's generally pretty deterministic so

2198
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:40,800
it's generally pretty deterministic so
 

2199
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,320
it's generally pretty deterministic so
if we know that I'll do in different

2200
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:42,330
if we know that I'll do in different
 

2201
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:46,700
if we know that I'll do in different

fly mission with two pilots one pilot no

2204
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:50,250
fly mission with two pilots one pilot no
 

2205
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:54,560
fly mission with two pilots one pilot no
pilots and and have if you can think of

2206
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:54,570
pilots and and have if you can think of
 

2207
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:56,810
pilots and and have if you can think of
it almost as like a dial of the level of

2208
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:56,820
it almost as like a dial of the level of
 

2209
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:59,480
it almost as like a dial of the level of
autonomy that you want but able so it's

2210
00:48:59,480 --> 00:48:59,490
autonomy that you want but able so it's
 

2211
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:01,100
autonomy that you want but able so it's
running in the background at all times

2212
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:01,110
running in the background at all times
 

2213
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:03,710
running in the background at all times
and able to pick up tasks whether it's

2214
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:03,720
and able to pick up tasks whether it's
 

2215
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,510
and able to pick up tasks whether it's
you know sort of autopilot kinds of

2216
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:05,520
you know sort of autopilot kinds of
 

2217
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:10,010
you know sort of autopilot kinds of
tasks or more sophisticated path

2218
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:10,020
tasks or more sophisticated path
 

2219
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:12,470
tasks or more sophisticated path
planning kinds of activities to be able

2220
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:12,480
planning kinds of activities to be able
 

2221
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,840
planning kinds of activities to be able
to do things like for example land on an

2222
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:14,850
to do things like for example land on an
 

2223
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:15,750
to do things like for example land on an
oil rig

2224
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:15,760
oil rig
 

2225
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,490
oil rig
you know in the North Sea in bad weather

2226
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:17,500
you know in the North Sea in bad weather
 

2227
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,130
you know in the North Sea in bad weather
zero zero conditions and you can imagine

2228
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:20,140
zero zero conditions and you can imagine
 

2229
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:21,720
zero zero conditions and you can imagine
of course there's a lot of military

2230
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:21,730
of course there's a lot of military
 

2231
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:24,420
of course there's a lot of military
utility to capability like that you know

2232
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:24,430
utility to capability like that you know
 

2233
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:26,640
utility to capability like that you know
you could have an aircraft that you want

2234
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:26,650
you could have an aircraft that you want
 

2235
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:28,440
you could have an aircraft that you want
to send out for a crewed mission but

2236
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:28,450
to send out for a crewed mission but
 

2237
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:30,390
to send out for a crewed mission but
then in the at night if you want to use

2238
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:30,400
then in the at night if you want to use
 

2239
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,490
then in the at night if you want to use
it to deliver supplies in an unmanned

2240
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:32,500
it to deliver supplies in an unmanned
 

2241
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:35,340
it to deliver supplies in an unmanned
mode that that could be done as well and

2242
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:35,350
mode that that could be done as well and
 

2243
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:37,710
mode that that could be done as well and
so there's there's there's clear

2244
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:37,720
so there's there's there's clear
 

2245
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,710
so there's there's there's clear
advantages there but think about on the

2246
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:40,720
advantages there but think about on the
 

2247
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,420
advantages there but think about on the
commercial side you know if you're an

2248
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:42,430
commercial side you know if you're an
 

2249
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:45,270
commercial side you know if you're an
aircraft taking you're gonna fly out to

2250
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:45,280
aircraft taking you're gonna fly out to
 

2251
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,800
aircraft taking you're gonna fly out to
this oil rig if you get out there and

2252
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:46,810
this oil rig if you get out there and
 

2253
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:49,230
this oil rig if you get out there and
you can't land then you gotta bring all

2254
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:49,240
you can't land then you gotta bring all
 

2255
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,420
you can't land then you gotta bring all
those people back reschedule another

2256
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:51,430
those people back reschedule another
 

2257
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:53,070
those people back reschedule another
flight pay the overtime for the crew

2258
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:53,080
flight pay the overtime for the crew
 

2259
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,870
flight pay the overtime for the crew
that you just brought back because they

2260
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:54,880
that you just brought back because they
 

2261
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:55,859
that you just brought back because they
didn't get where they're gonna pay for

2262
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:55,869
didn't get where they're gonna pay for
 

2263
00:49:55,869 --> 00:49:57,630
didn't get where they're gonna pay for
the or for the folks that are out there

2264
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:57,640
the or for the folks that are out there
 

2265
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,030
the or for the folks that are out there
and the oil rig this is real economic

2266
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:00,040
and the oil rig this is real economic
 

2267
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,770
and the oil rig this is real economic
you know these are dollars and cents

2268
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:01,780
you know these are dollars and cents
 

2269
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:04,050
you know these are dollars and cents
kinds of advantages we're bringing in

2270
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:04,060
kinds of advantages we're bringing in
 

2271
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:06,540
kinds of advantages we're bringing in
the commercial world as well so this is

2272
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:06,550
the commercial world as well so this is
 

2273
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:08,670
the commercial world as well so this is
a difficult question from the a space

2274
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:08,680
a difficult question from the a space
 

2275
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:11,040
a difficult question from the a space
that I would love it if we're able to

2276
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:11,050
that I would love it if we're able to
 

2277
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:13,380
that I would love it if we're able to
comment so a lot of this autonomy in AI

2278
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:13,390
comment so a lot of this autonomy in AI
 

2279
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:15,750
comment so a lot of this autonomy in AI
you've mentioned just now as this

2280
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:15,760
you've mentioned just now as this
 

2281
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,300
you've mentioned just now as this
empowering effect that one is the last

2282
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:18,310
empowering effect that one is the last
 

2283
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:20,820
empowering effect that one is the last
resort it keeps you safe the other is

2284
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:20,830
resort it keeps you safe the other is

resort it keeps you safe the other is
there's a with the teaming and in

2286
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:23,290
there's a with the teaming and in
 

2287
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:29,310
there's a with the teaming and in
general assistive assistive AI and I

2288
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:29,320
general assistive assistive AI and I
 

2289
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:33,240
general assistive assistive AI and I
think there's a there's always a race so

2290
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:33,250
think there's a there's always a race so
 

2291
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:36,270
think there's a there's always a race so
the world is full of the world is

2292
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:36,280
the world is full of the world is
 

2293
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:41,280
the world is full of the world is
complex it's full of bad actors so

2294
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:41,290
complex it's full of bad actors so
 

2295
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,260
complex it's full of bad actors so
there's there's often a race to make

2296
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:43,270
there's there's often a race to make
 

2297
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:46,470
there's there's often a race to make
sure that we keep this this country safe

2298
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:46,480
sure that we keep this this country safe
 

2299
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:52,050
sure that we keep this this country safe
right but with AI there is a concern as

2300
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:52,060
right but with AI there is a concern as
 

2301
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:55,710
right but with AI there is a concern as
a slightly different race there's a lot

2302
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:55,720
a slightly different race there's a lot
 

2303
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,880
a slightly different race there's a lot
of people in the eye space they're

2304
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:56,890
of people in the eye space they're
 

2305
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:00,390
of people in the eye space they're
concerned about the AI arms race that as

2306
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:00,400
concerned about the AI arms race that as
 

2307
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,190
concerned about the AI arms race that as
opposed to you the United States

2308
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:02,200
opposed to you the United States
 

2309
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,830
opposed to you the United States
becoming you know having the best

2310
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:04,840
becoming you know having the best
 

2311
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,510
becoming you know having the best
technology and therefore keeping us safe

2312
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:06,520
technology and therefore keeping us safe
 

2313
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:10,440
technology and therefore keeping us safe
we even we loose ability to keep control

2314
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:10,450
we even we loose ability to keep control
 

2315
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:14,340
we even we loose ability to keep control
of it so this the AI arms race getting

2316
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:14,350
of it so this the AI arms race getting
 

2317
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:18,240
of it so this the AI arms race getting
away from all of us humans so do you

2318
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:18,250
away from all of us humans so do you
 

2319
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:19,980
away from all of us humans so do you
share this worry do you share this

2320
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:19,990
share this worry do you share this
 

2321
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:21,750
share this worry do you share this
concern when we're talking about

2322
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:21,760
concern when we're talking about
 

2323
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,470
concern when we're talking about
military applications that too much

2324
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:24,480
military applications that too much
 

2325
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,150
military applications that too much
control and decision-making capabilities

2326
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:27,160
control and decision-making capabilities
 

2327
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,859
control and decision-making capabilities
giving too

2328
00:51:28,859 --> 00:51:28,869
giving too
 

2329
00:51:28,869 --> 00:51:33,299
giving too
after AI well I don't see it happening

2330
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:33,309
after AI well I don't see it happening
 

2331
00:51:33,309 --> 00:51:35,849
after AI well I don't see it happening
today and in fact this is something from

2332
00:51:35,849 --> 00:51:35,859
today and in fact this is something from
 

2333
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:38,489
today and in fact this is something from
a policy perspective you know it's

2334
00:51:38,489 --> 00:51:38,499
a policy perspective you know it's
 

2335
00:51:38,499 --> 00:51:40,259
a policy perspective you know it's
obviously a very dynamic space but the

2336
00:51:40,259 --> 00:51:40,269
obviously a very dynamic space but the
 

2337
00:51:40,269 --> 00:51:42,150
obviously a very dynamic space but the
Department of Defense has put quite a

2338
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:42,160
Department of Defense has put quite a
 

2339
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,789
Department of Defense has put quite a
bit of thought into that and maybe

2340
00:51:44,789 --> 00:51:44,799
bit of thought into that and maybe
 

2341
00:51:44,799 --> 00:51:46,620
bit of thought into that and maybe
before talking about the policy I'll

2342
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:46,630
before talking about the policy I'll
 

2343
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:49,289
before talking about the policy I'll
just talk about some of the why and you

2344
00:51:49,289 --> 00:51:49,299
just talk about some of the why and you
 

2345
00:51:49,299 --> 00:51:51,150
just talk about some of the why and you
alluded to it being a sort of a

2346
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:51,160
alluded to it being a sort of a
 

2347
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,400
alluded to it being a sort of a
complicated and a little bit scary world

2348
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:53,410
complicated and a little bit scary world
 

2349
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:56,339
complicated and a little bit scary world
out there but there's some big things

2350
00:51:56,339 --> 00:51:56,349
out there but there's some big things
 

2351
00:51:56,349 --> 00:51:58,319
out there but there's some big things
happening today you hear a lot of talk

2352
00:51:58,319 --> 00:51:58,329
happening today you hear a lot of talk
 

2353
00:51:58,329 --> 00:52:00,509
happening today you hear a lot of talk
now about a return to great powers

2354
00:52:00,509 --> 00:52:00,519
now about a return to great powers
 

2355
00:52:00,519 --> 00:52:02,970
now about a return to great powers

and Russia with the US but there are
 

2359
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,809
and Russia with the US but there are
some other big players out there as well

Russia and the invasion of Ukraine and
 

2383
00:52:44,739 --> 00:52:46,589
Russia and the invasion of Ukraine and
so there's there's some pretty scary

2384
00:52:46,589 --> 00:52:46,599
so there's there's some pretty scary
 

2385
00:52:46,599 --> 00:52:48,859
so there's there's some pretty scary
things and then you add on top of that

2386
00:52:48,859 --> 00:52:48,869
things and then you add on top of that
 

2387
00:52:48,869 --> 00:52:52,049
things and then you add on top of that
the North Korean threat has certainly

2388
00:52:52,049 --> 00:52:52,059
the North Korean threat has certainly
 

2389
00:52:52,059 --> 00:52:54,029
the North Korean threat has certainly
not gone away there's a lot going on in

2390
00:52:54,029 --> 00:52:54,039
not gone away there's a lot going on in
 

2391
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:55,589
not gone away there's a lot going on in
the Middle East with Iran in particular

the Middle East with Iran in particular
 

2393
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:59,720
the Middle East with Iran in particular
and we see this global terrorism threat

2394
00:52:59,720 --> 00:52:59,730
and we see this global terrorism threat
 

2395
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:03,599
and we see this global terrorism threat
has not abated right so there are a lot

2396
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:03,609
has not abated right so there are a lot
 

2397
00:53:03,609 --> 00:53:06,239
has not abated right so there are a lot
of reasons to look for technology to

2398
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:06,249
of reasons to look for technology to
 

2399
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:08,099
of reasons to look for technology to
assist with those problems whether it's

give just a couple of hypotheticals so
 

2407
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:21,210
give just a couple of hypotheticals so
people react sort of in the second

00:54:46,089 --> 00:54:46,099
just decreasing from thirty two years to
 

2465
00:54:46,099 --> 00:54:49,150
just decreasing from thirty two years to
one second as opposed to on the scale of

00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:49,160
one second as opposed to on the scale of
 

2467
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,710
one second as opposed to on the scale of

thinking and it actually goes the other
 

2473
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,589
thinking and it actually goes the other
way too so that's on the short timescale

2474
00:54:56,589 --> 00:54:56,599
way too so that's on the short timescale
 

2475
00:54:56,599 --> 00:54:58,690
way too so that's on the short timescale
so humans kind of work in the you know

2476
00:54:58,690 --> 00:54:58,700
so humans kind of work in the you know
 

2477
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:01,480
so humans kind of work in the you know
one second two seconds to eight hours

after eight hours you get tired you know
 

2481
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:05,440
after eight hours you get tired you know
you gotta go to the bathroom whatever

question that you brought up is okay how
 

2513
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:48,579
question that you brought up is okay how
do you make sure that stays within human

2514
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:48,589
do you make sure that stays within human
 

2515
00:55:48,589 --> 00:55:51,220
do you make sure that stays within human
control net so that was the context for

2516
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:51,230
control net so that was the context for
 

2517
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:53,440
control net so that was the context for
now the policy and so there is a DoD

2518
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:53,450
now the policy and so there is a DoD
 

2519
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:56,920
now the policy and so there is a DoD
directive called 3009 because that's the

2520
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:56,930
directive called 3009 because that's the
 

2521
00:55:56,930 --> 00:56:00,520
directive called 3009 because that's the
way we name stuff in this world and and

2522
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:00,530
way we name stuff in this world and and
 

2523
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:03,700
way we name stuff in this world and and
but it you know and I'd say it's well

2524
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:03,710
but it you know and I'd say it's well
 

2525
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:05,290
but it you know and I'd say it's well
worth reading it's only a couple pages

2526
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:05,300
worth reading it's only a couple pages
 

2527
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,359
worth reading it's only a couple pages
long but it makes some key points and

2528
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:07,369
long but it makes some key points and
 

2529
00:56:07,369 --> 00:56:09,460
long but it makes some key points and
it's really around you know making sure

2530
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:09,470
it's really around you know making sure
 

2531
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:13,560
it's really around you know making sure
there's human agency and control over

00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:29,210
scenarios making sure that the people
 

2543
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:31,270
scenarios making sure that the people
are actually trained on how to use them

are actually trained on how to use them
 

2545
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,900
are actually trained on how to use them
making sure the systems have

2546
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:33,910
making sure the systems have
 

2547
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:36,670
making sure the systems have
human-machine interfaces that can show

2548
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:36,680
human-machine interfaces that can show
 

2549
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,710
human-machine interfaces that can show
what state they're in and what kinds of

what state they're in and what kinds of
 

2551
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,780
what state they're in and what kinds of
decisions they're making making sure

2552
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:40,790
decisions they're making making sure
 

2553
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:43,720
decisions they're making making sure
that you establish doctrine and tactics

2554
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:43,730
that you establish doctrine and tactics
 

2555
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:46,210
that you establish doctrine and tactics
and techniques and procedures for the

2556
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:46,220
and techniques and procedures for the
 

2557
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:48,780
and techniques and procedures for the
use of these kinds of systems and so

2558
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:48,790
use of these kinds of systems and so
 

2559
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:51,310
use of these kinds of systems and so
right and by the way I mean the this

2560
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:51,320
right and by the way I mean the this
 

2561
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:54,160
right and by the way I mean the this
none of this is easy but it I'm just

2562
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:54,170
none of this is easy but it I'm just
 

2563
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:56,380
none of this is easy but it I'm just
trying to lay kind of the picture of how

2564
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:56,390
trying to lay kind of the picture of how
 

2565
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:59,109
trying to lay kind of the picture of how
the US has said this is the way we're

2566
00:56:59,109 --> 00:56:59,119
the US has said this is the way we're
 

2567
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:02,050
the US has said this is the way we're
going to treat AI and autonomous systems

2568
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:02,060
going to treat AI and autonomous systems
 

2569
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:05,349
going to treat AI and autonomous systems
that it's not a free-for-all and like

2570
00:57:05,349 --> 00:57:05,359
that it's not a free-for-all and like
 

2571
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:07,480
that it's not a free-for-all and like
there are rules of war and rules of

00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:07,490
there are rules of war and rules of
 

2573
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:09,430
there are rules of war and rules of
engagement with other kinds of systems

think chemical weapons biological
 

2577
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:13,960
think chemical weapons biological
weapons we need to think about the same

2578
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:13,970
weapons we need to think about the same
 

2579
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:16,300

00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:16,310
sorts of implications and this is
 

2581
00:57:16,310 --> 00:57:17,380
sorts of implications and this is
something that's really important for

2582
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:17,390
something that's really important for
 

2583
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:20,260
something that's really important for
Lockheed Martin I obviously we are 100%

2584
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:20,270
Lockheed Martin I obviously we are 100%
 

2585

complying with our customer and the
 

2587
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:28,030
complying with our customer and the
policies and regulations but I mean AI

policies and regulations but I mean AI
 

2589
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:31,120
policies and regulations but I mean AI
is an incredible enabler say within the

2590
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:31,130
is an incredible enabler say within the
 

2591
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:32,890
is an incredible enabler say within the
walls of Lockheed Martin in terms of

energy costs I mean there's so many

2600
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:42,710
energy costs I mean there's so many

application
 

2603
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:46,079
application
but we're you know we had we're also

2604
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:46,089
but we're you know we had we're also
 

2605
00:57:46,089 --> 00:57:48,270
but we're you know we had we're also
very interested in so many elements of

2606
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:48,280
very interested in so many elements of
 

2607
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,190
very interested in so many elements of
ethical application you know within

2608
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:50,200
ethical application you know within
 

2609
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,799
ethical application you know within
Lockheed Martin so we need to make sure

2610
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:52,809
Lockheed Martin so we need to make sure
 

2611
00:57:52,809 --> 00:57:56,490
Lockheed Martin so we need to make sure
that things like privacy is is taken

2612
00:57:56,490 --> 00:57:56,500
that things like privacy is is taken
 

2613
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,380
that things like privacy is is taken
care of that we do everything we can to

2614
00:57:58,380 --> 00:57:58,390
care of that we do everything we can to
 

2615
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:02,339
care of that we do everything we can to
drive out bias in AI enabled kinds of

2616
00:58:02,339 --> 00:58:02,349
drive out bias in AI enabled kinds of
 

2617
00:58:02,349 --> 00:58:04,920
drive out bias in AI enabled kinds of
systems that we make sure that humans

2618
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:04,930
systems that we make sure that humans
 

2619
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:06,660
systems that we make sure that humans
are involved in decisions that were not

2620
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:06,670
are involved in decisions that were not
 

2621
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:09,329
are involved in decisions that were not
just delegating accountability to

2622
00:58:09,329 --> 00:58:09,339
just delegating accountability to
 

2623
00:58:09,339 --> 00:58:12,599
just delegating accountability to
algorithms and so it for us you know it

2624
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:12,609
algorithms and so it for us you know it
 

2625
00:58:12,609 --> 00:58:14,130
algorithms and so it for us you know it
all comes back I talked about culture

2626
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:14,140
all comes back I talked about culture
 

2627
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:15,930
all comes back I talked about culture
before and it comes back to sort of the

2628
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:15,940
before and it comes back to sort of the
 

2629
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:18,450
before and it comes back to sort of the
Lockheed Martin culture and our core

2630
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:18,460
Lockheed Martin culture and our core
 

2631
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:20,700
Lockheed Martin culture and our core
values and so it's pretty simple for us

2632
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:20,710
values and so it's pretty simple for us
 

2633
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:22,410
values and so it's pretty simple for us
and do what's right respect others

2634
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:22,420
and do what's right respect others
 

2635
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:25,319
and do what's right respect others
perform with excellence and now how do

2636
00:58:25,319 --> 00:58:25,329
perform with excellence and now how do
 

2637
00:58:25,329 --> 00:58:27,180
perform with excellence and now how do
we tie that back to the ethical

2638
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:27,190
we tie that back to the ethical
 

2639
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:30,329
we tie that back to the ethical
principles of will govern how AI is used

2640
00:58:30,329 --> 00:58:30,339
principles of will govern how AI is used
 

2641
00:58:30,339 --> 00:58:32,309
principles of will govern how AI is used
within Lockheed Martin and we actually

2642
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:32,319
within Lockheed Martin and we actually
 

2643
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:35,460
within Lockheed Martin and we actually
have a world so you might not know this

2644
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:35,470
have a world so you might not know this
 

2645
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,079
have a world so you might not know this
but they're actually awards for ethics

2646
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:37,089
but they're actually awards for ethics
 

2647
00:58:37,089 --> 00:58:39,289
but they're actually awards for ethics
programs Lockheed Martin's had a

2648
00:58:39,289 --> 00:58:39,299
programs Lockheed Martin's had a
 

2649
00:58:39,299 --> 00:58:41,970
programs Lockheed Martin's had a
recognized ethics program for many years

2650
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:41,980
recognized ethics program for many years
 

2651
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:43,799
recognized ethics program for many years
and this is one of the things that our

2652
00:58:43,799 --> 00:58:43,809
and this is one of the things that our
 

2653
00:58:43,809 --> 00:58:45,240
and this is one of the things that our
ethics team is working with our

00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:06,140
civilization has not destroyed itself
 

2669
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,200
civilization has not destroyed itself
their nuclear war so nuclear deterrence

2670
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:08,210
their nuclear war so nuclear deterrence
 

2671
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:11,860
their nuclear war so nuclear deterrence
and the thinking about the future

2672
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:11,870
and the thinking about the future
 

2673
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:13,300
and the thinking about the future
there's this technology of a role to

2674
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:13,310
there's this technology of a role to
 

2675
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:16,080
there's this technology of a role to
play here and what is the long-term

2676
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:16,090
play here and what is the long-term
 

2677
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:19,620
play here and what is the long-term
future of nuclear deterrence look like

2678
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:19,630
future of nuclear deterrence look like
 

2679
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:22,870
future of nuclear deterrence look like
yeah it's you know this is one of those

2680
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:22,880
yeah it's you know this is one of those
 

2681
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,920
yeah it's you know this is one of those
hard hard questions and I should note

2682
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:26,930
hard hard questions and I should note
 

2683
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:28,660
hard hard questions and I should note
that Lockheed Martin is you know both

2684
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:28,670
that Lockheed Martin is you know both
 

2685
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:30,520
that Lockheed Martin is you know both
proud and privileged to play a part in

2686
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:30,530
proud and privileged to play a part in
 

2687
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:33,310
proud and privileged to play a part in
multiple legs of our nuclear and

2688
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:33,320
multiple legs of our nuclear and
 

2689
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,250
multiple legs of our nuclear and
strategic deterrent systems like the

2690
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:36,260
strategic deterrent systems like the
 

2691
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:38,770
strategic deterrent systems like the
Trident submarine launched ballistic

2692
00:59:38,770 --> 00:59:38,780
Trident submarine launched ballistic
 

2693
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:45,010
Trident submarine launched ballistic
missiles you know you talk about you

2694
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:45,020
missiles you know you talk about you
 

2695
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:47,530
missiles you know you talk about you
know is there still a possibility the

2696
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:47,540
know is there still a possibility the
 

2697
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:49,390
know is there still a possibility the
human race could destroy itself I'd say

2698
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:49,400
human race could destroy itself I'd say
 

2699
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,070
human race could destroy itself I'd say
that possibility is real but

2700
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:51,080
that possibility is real but
 

2701
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:55,990
that possibility is real but
interestingly in some sense I think the

2702
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:56,000
interestingly in some sense I think the
 

2703
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,220
interestingly in some sense I think the
strategic deterrence have prevented the

2704
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:00,230
strategic deterrence have prevented the
 

2705
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:02,950
strategic deterrence have prevented the
kinds of you know incredibly destruct

2706
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:02,960
kinds of you know incredibly destruct
 

2707
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,660
kinds of you know incredibly destruct
the world wars that we saw in the first

2708
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:04,670
the world wars that we saw in the first
 

2709
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:07,930
the world wars that we saw in the first
half of the 20th century now things have

2710
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:07,940
half of the 20th century now things have
 

2711
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:10,750
half of the 20th century now things have
gotten more complicated since that time

2712
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:10,760
gotten more complicated since that time
 

2713
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,060
gotten more complicated since that time
and since the Cold War is more of a

2714
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:13,070
and since the Cold War is more of a
 

2715
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:16,780
and since the Cold War is more of a
multipolar great powers world today just

2716
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:16,790
multipolar great powers world today just
 

2717
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:18,790
multipolar great powers world today just
to give you an example back then you

2718
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:18,800
to give you an example back then you
 

2719
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,980
to give you an example back then you
know there were you know in the in the

2720
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:20,990
know there were you know in the in the
 

2721
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:22,570
know there were you know in the in the
Cold War timeframe just a handful of

2722
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:22,580
Cold War timeframe just a handful of
 

2723
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:24,190
Cold War timeframe just a handful of
nations that had ballistic missile

2724
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:24,200
nations that had ballistic missile
 

2725
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,370
nations that had ballistic missile
capability by last count and this is a

2726
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:27,380
capability by last count and this is a
 

2727
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:29,380
capability by last count and this is a
few years old there's over 70 nations

2728
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:29,390
few years old there's over 70 nations
 

2729
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:32,490
few years old there's over 70 nations
today that have that similar kinds of

2730
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:32,500
today that have that similar kinds of
 

2731
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,070
today that have that similar kinds of
numbers in terms of space-based

2732
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:35,080
numbers in terms of space-based
 

2733
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:40,150
numbers in terms of space-based
capabilities so so the world has gotten

2734
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:40,160
capabilities so so the world has gotten
 

2735
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,640
capabilities so so the world has gotten
more complex and more challenging and

2736
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:42,650
more complex and more challenging and
 

2737
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:45,700
more complex and more challenging and
the threats I think have proliferated in

2738
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:45,710
the threats I think have proliferated in
 

2739
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:49,250
the threats I think have proliferated in
ways that we didn't expect

2740
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:49,260

 

2741
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:51,680

you know the the nation today is in the

2742
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:51,690
you know the the nation today is in the
 

2743
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:53,480
you know the the nation today is in the
middle of a recapitalization of our

2744
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:53,490
middle of a recapitalization of our
 

2745
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:56,720
middle of a recapitalization of our
strategic deterrent I look at that as

2746
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:56,730
strategic deterrent I look at that as
 

2747
01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:58,670
strategic deterrent I look at that as
one of the most important things that

2748
01:00:58,670 --> 01:00:58,680
one of the most important things that
 

2749
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:01,130
one of the most important things that
our nation can do what is involved in

2750
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:01,140
our nation can do what is involved in
 

2751
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:05,770
our nation can do what is involved in
deterrence is it is it being ready to

2752
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:05,780
deterrence is it is it being ready to
 

2753
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:09,680
deterrence is it is it being ready to
attack or is it the defensive systems

2754
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:09,690
attack or is it the defensive systems
 

2755
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:12,320
attack or is it the defensive systems
that catch attacks a little bit of both

2756
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:12,330
that catch attacks a little bit of both
 

2757
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:14,450
that catch attacks a little bit of both
and so it's a complicated game

2758
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:14,460
and so it's a complicated game
 

2759
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:17,440
and so it's a complicated game
theoretical kind of program but

2760
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:17,450
theoretical kind of program but
 

2761
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:22,609
theoretical kind of program but
ultimately we are trying to prevent the

2762
01:01:22,609 --> 01:01:22,619
ultimately we are trying to prevent the
 

2763
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:25,430
ultimately we are trying to prevent the
use of any of these weapons and the

2764
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:25,440
use of any of these weapons and the
 

2765
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,750
use of any of these weapons and the
theory behind prevention is that even if

2766
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:29,760
theory behind prevention is that even if
 

2767
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,780
theory behind prevention is that even if
an adversary uses a weapon against you

2768
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:32,790
an adversary uses a weapon against you
 

2769
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:36,200
an adversary uses a weapon against you
you have the capability to essentially

2770
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:36,210
you have the capability to essentially
 

2771
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:39,859
you have the capability to essentially
strike back and do harm to them that's

2772
01:01:39,859 --> 01:01:39,869
strike back and do harm to them that's
 

2773
01:01:39,869 --> 01:01:40,730
strike back and do harm to them that's
unacceptable

2774
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:40,740
unacceptable
 

2775
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:43,609
unacceptable
and so that will deter them from you

2776
01:01:43,609 --> 01:01:43,619
and so that will deter them from you
 

2777
01:01:43,619 --> 01:01:47,170
and so that will deter them from you
know making use of these weapon systems

2778
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:47,180
know making use of these weapon systems
 

2779
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:50,359
know making use of these weapon systems
the deterrence calculus has changed of

2780
01:01:50,359 --> 01:01:50,369
the deterrence calculus has changed of
 

2781
01:01:50,369 --> 01:01:53,120
the deterrence calculus has changed of
course with you know more nations now

2782
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:53,130
course with you know more nations now
 

2783
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:56,720
course with you know more nations now
having these kinds of weapons but I

2784
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:56,730
having these kinds of weapons but I
 

2785
01:01:56,730 --> 01:01:59,060
having these kinds of weapons but I
think you know from my perspective it's

2786
01:01:59,060 --> 01:01:59,070
think you know from my perspective it's
 

2787
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:02,960
think you know from my perspective it's
very important you know to maintain a

2788
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:02,970
very important you know to maintain a
 

2789
01:02:02,970 --> 01:02:05,660
very important you know to maintain a
strategic deterrent you have to have

2790
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:05,670
strategic deterrent you have to have
 

2791
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:08,150
strategic deterrent you have to have
systems that you will know you know will

2792
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:08,160
systems that you will know you know will
 

2793
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:11,240
systems that you will know you know will
work when they're required to work you

2794
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:11,250
work when they're required to work you
 

2795
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:13,700
work when they're required to work you
know that they have to be adaptable to a

2796
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:13,710
know that they have to be adaptable to a
 

2797
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:16,400
know that they have to be adaptable to a
variety of different scenarios in

2798
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:16,410
variety of different scenarios in
 

2799
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:18,740
variety of different scenarios in
today's world and so that's what this

2800
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:18,750
today's world and so that's what this
 

2801
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:20,540
today's world and so that's what this
recapitalization of systems that were

2802
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:20,550
recapitalization of systems that were
 

2803
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:23,359
recapitalization of systems that were
built over in previous decades making

2804
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:23,369
built over in previous decades making
 

2805
01:02:23,369 --> 01:02:25,820
built over in previous decades making
sure that they are appropriate not just

2806
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:25,830
sure that they are appropriate not just
 

2807
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:29,270
sure that they are appropriate not just
for today but for the decades to come so

2808
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:29,280
for today but for the decades to come so
 

2809
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,970
for today but for the decades to come so
the other thing I'd really like to note

2810
01:02:31,970 --> 01:02:31,980
the other thing I'd really like to note
 

2811
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:34,849
the other thing I'd really like to note
is strategic deterrence has a very

2812
01:02:34,849 --> 01:02:34,859
is strategic deterrence has a very
 

2813
01:02:34,859 --> 01:02:40,220
is strategic deterrence has a very
different character today you know we

2814
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:40,230
different character today you know we
 

2815
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:41,630
different character today you know we
used to think of weapons of mass

2816
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:41,640
used to think of weapons of mass
 

2817
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,820
used to think of weapons of mass
destruction in terms of nuclear chemical

2818
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:43,830
destruction in terms of nuclear chemical
 

2819
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:47,390
destruction in terms of nuclear chemical
biological and today we have a cyber

2820
01:02:47,390 --> 01:02:47,400
biological and today we have a cyber
 

2821
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:51,560
biological and today we have a cyber
threat we've seen examples of the use of

2822
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:51,570
threat we've seen examples of the use of
 

2823
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:56,510
threat we've seen examples of the use of
cyber weaponry and if you think about

2824
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:56,520
cyber weaponry and if you think about
 

2825
01:02:56,520 --> 01:03:00,380
cyber weaponry and if you think about
the possibilities of using cyber

2826
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:00,390
the possibilities of using cyber
 

2827
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:02,110
the possibilities of using cyber
capabilities or an adverse

2828
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:02,120
capabilities or an adverse
 

2829
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:05,430
capabilities or an adverse
attacking the us to take out things like

2830
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:05,440
attacking the us to take out things like
 

2831
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,620
attacking the us to take out things like
critical infrastructure electrical grids

2832
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:08,630
critical infrastructure electrical grids
 

2833
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:14,050
critical infrastructure electrical grids
water systems those are scenarios that

2834
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:14,060
water systems those are scenarios that
 

2835
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:17,260
water systems those are scenarios that
are strategic in nature to the survival

2836
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:17,270
are strategic in nature to the survival
 

2837
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:20,140
are strategic in nature to the survival
of a nation as well so that is the kind

2838
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:20,150
of a nation as well so that is the kind
 

2839
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:24,520
of a nation as well so that is the kind
of world that we live in today and you

2840
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:24,530
of world that we live in today and you
 

2841
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:26,800
of world that we live in today and you
know part of my hope on this is one that

2842
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:26,810
know part of my hope on this is one that
 

2843
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:29,260
know part of my hope on this is one that
we can also develop technical or

2844
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:29,270
we can also develop technical or
 

2845
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:32,020
we can also develop technical or
technological systems perhaps enabled by

2846
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:32,030
technological systems perhaps enabled by
 

2847
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:35,400
technological systems perhaps enabled by
a and athon imme that will allow us to

2848
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:35,410
a and athon imme that will allow us to
 

2849
01:03:35,410 --> 01:03:39,190
a and athon imme that will allow us to
contain and to fight back against these

2850
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:39,200
contain and to fight back against these
 

2851
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,400
contain and to fight back against these
kinds of new threats that were not

2852
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:42,410
kinds of new threats that were not
 

2853
01:03:42,410 --> 01:03:44,920
kinds of new threats that were not
conceived when we first developed our

2854
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:44,930
conceived when we first developed our
 

2855
01:03:44,930 --> 01:03:46,870
conceived when we first developed our
strategic deterrence yeah I know that

2856
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:46,880
strategic deterrence yeah I know that
 

2857
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,850
strategic deterrence yeah I know that
Lockheed is involved in cyber I saw I

incredibly a nuclear almost seems easier
 

2863
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:58,150
incredibly a nuclear almost seems easier
than cyber because there's so many

01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:08,000
with the mission I mean in this case
 

2873
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,290
with the mission I mean in this case
that you're engineering systems that

2889
01:04:28,550 --> 01:04:32,170
Lockheed bills both military and
non-military systems and perhaps the

2890
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:32,180
non-military systems and perhaps the
 

2891
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:33,670
non-military systems and perhaps the
future of Lockheed may be more in

2892
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:33,680
future of Lockheed may be more in
 

2893
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,650
future of Lockheed may be more in
non-military applications if you talk

2894
01:04:35,650 --> 01:04:35,660
non-military applications if you talk
 

2895
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:39,400
non-military applications if you talk
about space and beyond I see that as a

about space and beyond I see that as a
 

2897
01:04:39,410 --> 01:04:41,590

military-industrial complex and that it
 

2905

what are your thoughts on those words on

01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:55,400
what are your thoughts on those words on
 

2909
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:59,050
what are your thoughts on those words on
the military-industrial complex on the

01:04:59,050 --> 01:04:59,060
the military-industrial complex on the

01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:10,390
beyond what may be needed that what
where it may be needed is a critical

2916
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:10,400
where it may be needed is a critical
 

2917
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,290
where it may be needed is a critical
phrase of course

2918
01:05:12,290 --> 01:05:12,300
phrase of course
 

2919
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:14,210
phrase of course
and and I think it is worth pointing out

2920
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:14,220
and and I think it is worth pointing out
 

2921
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:16,130
and and I think it is worth pointing out
as you noted that Lockheed Martin we are

2922
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:16,140
as you noted that Lockheed Martin we are
 

2923
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:19,190
as you noted that Lockheed Martin we are

aircraft and so I wouldn't and I
 

2929
01:05:26,310 --> 01:05:29,110
aircraft and so I wouldn't and I
wouldn't neglect the importance of those

2930
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:29,120
wouldn't neglect the importance of those
 

2931
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:32,450
wouldn't neglect the importance of those
parts of our business as well I think

2932
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:32,460
parts of our business as well I think
 

2933
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:36,080
parts of our business as well I think
the world is dynamic and you know there

01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:40,290
to me it was I was a graduate student
 

2939
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:42,710
to me it was I was a graduate student
here at MIT and we were talking about

2940
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:42,720
here at MIT and we were talking about
 

2941
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,450
here at MIT and we were talking about
the peace dividend at the end of the

01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:44,460
the peace dividend at the end of the
 

2943
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:47,750
the peace dividend at the end of the
Cold War if you look at expenditure on

01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:47,760
Cold War if you look at expenditure on
 

2945
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,350

military systems as a fraction of GDP
 

2947
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:54,560
military systems as a fraction of GDP
were far below peak levels of the past

2948
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:54,570
were far below peak levels of the past
 

2949
01:05:54,570 --> 01:05:58,970
were far below peak levels of the past
and to me at least it looks like a time

2950
01:05:58,970 --> 01:05:58,980
and to me at least it looks like a time
 

2951
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:00,860
and to me at least it looks like a time
where you're seeing global threats

2983
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:57,230
operating the way they're intended every
time and so that does create and it's

2984
01:06:57,230 --> 01:06:57,240
time and so that does create and it's
 

2985
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:58,730
time and so that does create and it's
frankly it's one of Lockheed Martin's

2986
01:06:58,730 --> 01:06:58,740
frankly it's one of Lockheed Martin's
 

2987
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:00,500
frankly it's one of Lockheed Martin's
great strengths is that we have this

2988
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:00,510
great strengths is that we have this
 

2989
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:03,500
great strengths is that we have this
expertise built up over many years in

2990
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:03,510
expertise built up over many years in
 

2991
01:07:03,510 --> 01:07:05,540
expertise built up over many years in
partnership with our customers to be

2992
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:05,550
partnership with our customers to be
 

2993
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:08,120
partnership with our customers to be
able to design and build these systems

2994
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:08,130
able to design and build these systems
 

2995
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:10,490
able to design and build these systems
that meet these very unique mission

2996
01:07:10,490 --> 01:07:10,500
that meet these very unique mission
 

2997
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:10,880
that meet these very unique mission
needs

2998
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:10,890
needs
 

2999
01:07:10,890 --> 01:07:13,220
needs
yeah because building those system is

3000
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:13,230
yeah because building those system is
 

3001
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:15,170
yeah because building those system is
very costly it's very little room for

3002
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:15,180
very costly it's very little room for
 

3003
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:17,990
very costly it's very little room for
mistake I mean it's yeah just been

3004
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:18,000
mistake I mean it's yeah just been
 

3005
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,430
mistake I mean it's yeah just been
Rich's book and so on just tells the

3006
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:19,440
Rich's book and so on just tells the
 

3007
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,710
Rich's book and so on just tells the
story it's never I can just reading it

3008
01:07:21,710 --> 01:07:21,720
story it's never I can just reading it
 

3009
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:23,960
story it's never I can just reading it
if you're an engineer it's reads like a

3010
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:23,970
if you're an engineer it's reads like a
 

3011
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:25,640
if you're an engineer it's reads like a
thriller okay

3012
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:25,650
thriller okay
 

3013
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:29,120
thriller okay
let me let's go back to space for say

3014
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:29,130
let me let's go back to space for say
 

3015
01:07:29,130 --> 01:07:31,940
let me let's go back to space for say
I guess I'm always happy to go back to

3016
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:31,950
I guess I'm always happy to go back to
 

3017
01:07:31,950 --> 01:07:36,440
I guess I'm always happy to go back to
space so a few quick may be out there a

3018
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:36,450
space so a few quick may be out there a
 

3019
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:39,760
space so a few quick may be out there a
fun questions maybe a little provocative

3020
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:39,770
fun questions maybe a little provocative
 

3021
01:07:39,770 --> 01:07:44,140
fun questions maybe a little provocative
what are your thoughts on the efforts of

3022
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:44,150
what are your thoughts on the efforts of
 

3023
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:48,040
what are your thoughts on the efforts of
the new folks SpaceX and you know musk

3024
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:48,050
the new folks SpaceX and you know musk
 

3025
01:07:48,050 --> 01:07:50,390
the new folks SpaceX and you know musk
what are your thoughts about what Elon

3026
01:07:50,390 --> 01:07:50,400
what are your thoughts about what Elon
 

3027
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,250
what are your thoughts about what Elon
is doing you see Miss competition

3028
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:52,260
is doing you see Miss competition
 

3029
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:55,610
is doing you see Miss competition
do you enjoy a competition Oh what are

3030
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:55,620
do you enjoy a competition Oh what are
 

3031
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:57,790
do you enjoy a competition Oh what are
your thoughts yeah first of all

3032
01:07:57,790 --> 01:07:57,800
your thoughts yeah first of all
 

3033
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,870
your thoughts yeah first of all
certainly you on

3034
01:07:59,870 --> 01:07:59,880
certainly you on
 

3035
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,240
certainly you on
I'd say SpaceX and some of the and some

3036
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:02,250
I'd say SpaceX and some of the and some
 

3037
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:03,910
I'd say SpaceX and some of the and some
of those other ventures are definitely a

3038
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:03,920
of those other ventures are definitely a
 

3039
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,920
of those other ventures are definitely a
competitive force in the in the space

3040
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:06,930
competitive force in the in the space
 

3041
01:08:06,930 --> 01:08:10,130
competitive force in the in the space
industry and do we like competition yeah

3042
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:10,140
industry and do we like competition yeah
 

3043
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:10,940
industry and do we like competition yeah
we do

3044
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:10,950
we do
 

3045
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:14,060
we do
and we think we're very strong

3046
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:14,070
and we think we're very strong
 

3047
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:17,020
and we think we're very strong
competitors I think it's yeah

3048
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:17,030
competitors I think it's yeah
 

3049
01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:20,660
competitors I think it's yeah
competition is what the US is founded on

3050
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:20,670
competition is what the US is founded on
 

3051
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:23,510
competition is what the US is founded on
and in a lot of ways and always coming

3052
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:23,520
and in a lot of ways and always coming
 

3053
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,660
and in a lot of ways and always coming
up with a better way and I I think it's

3054
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:26,670
up with a better way and I I think it's
 

3055
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:29,330
up with a better way and I I think it's
really important to continue you know

3056
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:29,340
really important to continue you know
 

3057
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:32,090
really important to continue you know
have fresh eyes coming in new innovation

3058
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:32,100
have fresh eyes coming in new innovation
 

3059
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:34,670
have fresh eyes coming in new innovation
I do think it's important to have level

3060
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:34,680
I do think it's important to have level
 

3061
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:36,710
I do think it's important to have level
playing fields and so you want to make

3062
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:36,720
playing fields and so you want to make
 

3063
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:39,070
playing fields and so you want to make
sure that that you're not giving

3064
01:08:39,070 --> 01:08:39,080
sure that that you're not giving
 

3065
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:41,720
sure that that you're not giving
different requirements to different

3066
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:41,730
different requirements to different
 

3067
01:08:41,730 --> 01:08:45,380
different requirements to different
players but you know I tell people you

3068
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:45,390
players but you know I tell people you
 

3069
01:08:45,390 --> 01:08:46,820
players but you know I tell people you
know I spent a lot of time he places

3070
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:46,830
know I spent a lot of time he places
 

3071
01:08:46,830 --> 01:08:48,490
know I spent a lot of time he places
like MIT I'm going to be at the MIT

3072
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:48,500
like MIT I'm going to be at the MIT
 

3073
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,840
like MIT I'm going to be at the MIT
beaver work Summer Institute over the

3074
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:50,850
beaver work Summer Institute over the
 

3075
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:53,240
beaver work Summer Institute over the
weekend here and I tell people this is

3076
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:53,250
weekend here and I tell people this is
 

3077
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:55,490
weekend here and I tell people this is
the most exciting time to be in the

3078
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:55,500
the most exciting time to be in the
 

3079
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:59,180
the most exciting time to be in the
space business in my entire life and it

3080
01:08:59,180 --> 01:08:59,190
space business in my entire life and it
 

3081
01:08:59,190 --> 01:09:02,210
space business in my entire life and it
is this explosion of new capabilities

3082
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:02,220
is this explosion of new capabilities
 

3083
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:05,780
is this explosion of new capabilities
that have been driven by things like the

3084
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:05,790
that have been driven by things like the
 

3085
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:06,890
that have been driven by things like the
you know the massive increase in

3086
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:06,900
you know the massive increase in
 

3087
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:10,250
you know the massive increase in
computing power things like the massive

3088
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:10,260
computing power things like the massive
 

3089
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:13,640
computing power things like the massive
increase in comms capabilities advanced

3090
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:13,650
increase in comms capabilities advanced
 

3091
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,860
increase in comms capabilities advanced
and additive manufacturing are are

3092
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:15,870
and additive manufacturing are are
 

3093
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:18,140
and additive manufacturing are are
really bringing down the barriers to

3094
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:18,150
really bringing down the barriers to
 

3095
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:20,030
really bringing down the barriers to
entry in this field and it's driving

3096
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:20,040
entry in this field and it's driving
 

3097
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:22,040
entry in this field and it's driving
just incredible innovation and it's

3098
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:22,050
just incredible innovation and it's
 

3099
01:09:22,050 --> 01:09:23,420
just incredible innovation and it's
happening at startups but it's also

3100
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:23,430
happening at startups but it's also
 

3101
01:09:23,430 --> 01:09:25,670
happening at startups but it's also
happening at Lockheed Martin may not

3102
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:25,680
happening at Lockheed Martin may not
 

3103
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:27,590
happening at Lockheed Martin may not
realize this but Lockheed Martin working

3104
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:27,600
realize this but Lockheed Martin working
 

3105
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,270
realize this but Lockheed Martin working
with Stanford actually built the first

3106
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:29,280
with Stanford actually built the first
 

3107
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:32,750
with Stanford actually built the first
cubes that was launched here out of the

3108
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:32,760
cubes that was launched here out of the
 

3109
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:35,420
cubes that was launched here out of the
u.s. that was called quakes and we did

3110
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:35,430
u.s. that was called quakes and we did
 

3111
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:38,120
u.s. that was called quakes and we did
that with stellar solutions this

3112
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:38,130
that with stellar solutions this
 

3113
01:09:38,130 --> 01:09:41,750
that with stellar solutions this
right around just after 2000 I guess and

3114
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:41,760
right around just after 2000 I guess and
 

3115
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:44,120
right around just after 2000 I guess and
so we've been in that you know from the

3116
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:44,130
so we've been in that you know from the
 

3117
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:47,780
so we've been in that you know from the
very beginning and you know I I talked

3118
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:47,790
very beginning and you know I I talked
 

3119
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:49,160
very beginning and you know I I talked
about some of these like you know Maya

3120
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:49,170
about some of these like you know Maya
 

3121
01:09:49,170 --> 01:09:51,500
about some of these like you know Maya
and Orion but you know we're in the

3122
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:51,510
and Orion but you know we're in the
 

3123
01:09:51,510 --> 01:09:54,320
and Orion but you know we're in the
middle of what we call smart sets and

3124
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:54,330
middle of what we call smart sets and
 

3125
01:09:54,330 --> 01:09:56,120
middle of what we call smart sets and
software-defined satellites that can

3126
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:56,130
software-defined satellites that can
 

3127
01:09:56,130 --> 01:09:59,470
software-defined satellites that can
essentially restructure and re map their

3128
01:09:59,470 --> 01:09:59,480
essentially restructure and re map their
 

3129
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:02,750
essentially restructure and re map their
purpose their mission on orbit to give

3130
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:02,760
purpose their mission on orbit to give
 

3131
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:05,810
purpose their mission on orbit to give
you almost unlimited flexibility for

3132
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:05,820
you almost unlimited flexibility for
 

3133
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:08,180
you almost unlimited flexibility for
these satellites over their lifetimes so

3134
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:08,190
these satellites over their lifetimes so
 

3135
01:10:08,190 --> 01:10:10,340
these satellites over their lifetimes so
those are just a couple of examples but

3136
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:10,350
those are just a couple of examples but
 

3137
01:10:10,350 --> 01:10:12,740
those are just a couple of examples but
yeah this this is a great time to be in

3138
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:12,750
yeah this this is a great time to be in
 

3139
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,210
yeah this this is a great time to be in
space absolutely

3140
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:14,220
space absolutely
 

3141
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:16,700
space absolutely
so Wright brothers flew for the first

3142
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:16,710
so Wright brothers flew for the first
 

3143
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:20,930
so Wright brothers flew for the first
time 116 years ago so now we have

3144
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:20,940
time 116 years ago so now we have
 

3145
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:23,360
time 116 years ago so now we have
supersonic stealth planes and all the

3146
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:23,370
supersonic stealth planes and all the
 

3147
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:25,670
supersonic stealth planes and all the
technology we've talked about what

3148
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:25,680
technology we've talked about what
 

3149
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:28,730
technology we've talked about what
innovations obviously you can't predict

3150
01:10:28,730 --> 01:10:28,740
innovations obviously you can't predict
 

3151
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:30,590
innovations obviously you can't predict
the future but do you see Lockheed in

3152
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:30,600
the future but do you see Lockheed in
 

3153
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,990
the future but do you see Lockheed in
the next hundred years if you take that

3154
01:10:32,990 --> 01:10:33,000
the next hundred years if you take that
 

3155
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,230
the next hundred years if you take that
same leap how will the world of

3156
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:36,240
same leap how will the world of
 

3157
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:37,970
same leap how will the world of
technology engineering change I know

3158
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:37,980
technology engineering change I know
 

3159
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:41,300
technology engineering change I know
it's an impossible question but nobody

3160
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:41,310
it's an impossible question but nobody
 

3161
01:10:41,310 --> 01:10:42,860
it's an impossible question but nobody
could have predicted that we could even

3162
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:42,870
could have predicted that we could even
 

3163
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:45,920
could have predicted that we could even
fly a hundred and twenty years ago so

3164
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:45,930
fly a hundred and twenty years ago so
 

3165
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:49,970
fly a hundred and twenty years ago so
what do you think is the edge of

3166
01:10:49,970 --> 01:10:49,980
what do you think is the edge of
 

3167
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:51,350
what do you think is the edge of
possibility that we're going to be

3168
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:51,360
possibility that we're going to be
 

3169
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,180
possibility that we're going to be
exploring the next I don't know that

3170
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:53,190
exploring the next I don't know that
 

3171
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:55,730
exploring the next I don't know that
there is an edge I you know we've been

3172
01:10:55,730 --> 01:10:55,740
there is an edge I you know we've been
 

3173
01:10:55,740 --> 01:11:00,410
there is an edge I you know we've been
around for almost that entire time right

3174
01:11:00,410 --> 01:11:00,420

 

3175
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:03,770

the Lockheed brothers and Glenn L Martin

3176
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:03,780
the Lockheed brothers and Glenn L Martin
 

3177
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:06,320
the Lockheed brothers and Glenn L Martin
starting their companies you know

3178
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:06,330
starting their companies you know
 

3179
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:09,500
starting their companies you know
basement of a church and a old you know

3180
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:09,510
basement of a church and a old you know
 

3181
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:12,620
basement of a church and a old you know
service station we're very different

3182
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:12,630
service station we're very different
 

3183
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:15,260
service station we're very different
companies today than we were back then

3184
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:15,270
companies today than we were back then
 

3185
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:16,760
companies today than we were back then
right and that's because we've

3186
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:16,770
right and that's because we've
 

3187
01:11:16,770 --> 01:11:19,370
right and that's because we've
continuously reinvented ourselves over

3188
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:19,380
continuously reinvented ourselves over
 

3189
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:22,100
continuously reinvented ourselves over
the all of those decades I think it's

3190
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:22,110
the all of those decades I think it's
 

3191
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:24,050
the all of those decades I think it's
fair to say yeah I know this for sure

3192
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:24,060
fair to say yeah I know this for sure
 

3193
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:26,630
fair to say yeah I know this for sure
the world of the future it's going to

3194
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:26,640
the world of the future it's going to
 

3195
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,460
the world of the future it's going to
move faster it's going to be more

3196
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:28,470
move faster it's going to be more
 

3197
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:30,080
move faster it's going to be more
connected it's going to be more

3198
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:30,090
connected it's going to be more
 

3199
01:11:30,090 --> 01:11:33,530
connected it's going to be more
autonomous and it's going to be more

3200
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:33,540
autonomous and it's going to be more
 

3201
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:35,600
autonomous and it's going to be more
complex than it is today

3202
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:35,610
complex than it is today
 

3203
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:38,480
complex than it is today
and so this is the world you know as a

3204
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:38,490
and so this is the world you know as a
 

3205
01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:40,280
and so this is the world you know as a
CTL Lockheed Martin that I think about

3206
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:40,290
CTL Lockheed Martin that I think about
 

3207
01:11:40,290 --> 01:11:41,780
CTL Lockheed Martin that I think about
what are the technologies that we have

3208
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:41,790
what are the technologies that we have
 

3209
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:43,790
what are the technologies that we have
to invest in whether it's things like AI

3210
01:11:43,790 --> 01:11:43,800
to invest in whether it's things like AI
 

3211
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,010
to invest in whether it's things like AI
and autonomy you know you can think

3212
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:46,020
and autonomy you know you can think
 

3213
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:47,990
and autonomy you know you can think
about quantum computing which is an area

3214
01:11:47,990 --> 01:11:48,000
about quantum computing which is an area
 

3215
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,550
about quantum computing which is an area
that we've invested in to try to stay

3216
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:50,560
that we've invested in to try to stay
 

3217
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:53,370
that we've invested in to try to stay
of these technological changes and

3218
01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:53,380
of these technological changes and
 

3219
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:55,170
of these technological changes and
frankly some of the threats that are out

3220
01:11:55,170 --> 01:11:55,180
frankly some of the threats that are out
 

3221
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:57,750
frankly some of the threats that are out
there I mean I believe that we're going

3222
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:57,760
there I mean I believe that we're going
 

3223
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,460
there I mean I believe that we're going
to be out there in the solar system that

3224
01:11:59,460 --> 01:11:59,470
to be out there in the solar system that
 

3225
01:11:59,470 --> 01:12:01,650
to be out there in the solar system that
we're gonna be defending and defending

3226
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:01,660
we're gonna be defending and defending
 

3227
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:04,260
we're gonna be defending and defending
well against probably you know military

3228
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:04,270
well against probably you know military
 

3229
01:12:04,270 --> 01:12:06,180
well against probably you know military
threats that nobody has even thought

3230
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:06,190
threats that nobody has even thought
 

3231
01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:10,740
threats that nobody has even thought
about today we are going to be we're

3232
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:10,750
about today we are going to be we're
 

3233
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:12,660
about today we are going to be we're
going to use these capabilities to have

3234
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:12,670
going to use these capabilities to have
 

3235
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:15,240
going to use these capabilities to have
far greater knowledge of our own planet

3236
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:15,250
far greater knowledge of our own planet
 

3237
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:17,310
far greater knowledge of our own planet
the depths of the oceans you know all

3238
01:12:17,310 --> 01:12:17,320
the depths of the oceans you know all
 

3239
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:19,350
the depths of the oceans you know all
the way to the upper reaches the

3240
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:19,360
the way to the upper reaches the
 

3241
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,240
the way to the upper reaches the
atmosphere and everything out to the Sun

3242
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:21,250
atmosphere and everything out to the Sun
 

3243
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:24,420
atmosphere and everything out to the Sun
into the edge of the solar system so so

3244
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:24,430
into the edge of the solar system so so
 

3245
01:12:24,430 --> 01:12:28,680
into the edge of the solar system so so
that's what I look forward to and I I'm

3246
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:28,690
that's what I look forward to and I I'm
 

3247
01:12:28,690 --> 01:12:30,990
that's what I look forward to and I I'm
excited I mean just looking ahead in the

3248
01:12:30,990 --> 01:12:31,000
excited I mean just looking ahead in the
 

3249
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,480
excited I mean just looking ahead in the
next decade or so to the steps that I

3250
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:33,490
next decade or so to the steps that I
 

3251
01:12:33,490 --> 01:12:36,450
next decade or so to the steps that I
see ahead of us in that time I don't

3252
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:36,460
see ahead of us in that time I don't
 

3253
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:38,310
see ahead of us in that time I don't
think there's a better place to end K

3254
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:38,320
think there's a better place to end K
 

3255
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,420
think there's a better place to end K
okay thank you so much

3256
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:39,430
okay thank you so much
 

3257
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:41,820
okay thank you so much
