arrival so let me ask maybe a bit of a

216
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:24,389
arrival so let me ask maybe a bit of a
 

217
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,450
arrival so let me ask maybe a bit of a
crazy question but if aliens were to

218
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:26,460
crazy question but if aliens were to
 

219
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,640
crazy question but if aliens were to
visit us on earth do you think we would

220
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:28,650
visit us on earth do you think we would
 

221
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:32,840
visit us on earth do you think we would
be able to find a common language well

222
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:32,850
be able to find a common language well
 

223
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,400
be able to find a common language well
by the time we're saying

224
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:34,410
by the time we're saying
 

225
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,320
by the time we're saying
aliens are visiting us we've already

226
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:36,330
aliens are visiting us we've already
 

227
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,439
aliens are visiting us we've already
prejudiced the whole story because the

228
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:39,449
prejudiced the whole story because the
 

229
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:41,990
prejudiced the whole story because the
you know the concept of alien actually

230
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
you know the concept of alien actually
 

231
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,640
you know the concept of alien actually
visiting so to speak we already know

232
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:43,650
visiting so to speak we already know
 

233
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,580
visiting so to speak we already know
they're kind of things that make sense

234
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:46,590
they're kind of things that make sense
 

235
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,680
they're kind of things that make sense
to talk about visiting so we already

236
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:48,690
to talk about visiting so we already
 

237
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,330
to talk about visiting so we already
know they exist in the same kind of

238
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:50,340
know they exist in the same kind of
 

239
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,620
know they exist in the same kind of
physical setup that we do they're not

240
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:53,630
physical setup that we do they're not
 

241
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,260
physical setup that we do they're not
you know it's not just radio signals

242
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:57,270
you know it's not just radio signals
 

243
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,900
you know it's not just radio signals
it's an actual thing that shows up and

244
00:04:59,900 --> 00:04:59,910
it's an actual thing that shows up and
 

245
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,080
it's an actual thing that shows up and
so on so I think in terms of you know

246
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,090
so on so I think in terms of you know
 

247
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,110
so on so I think in terms of you know
can one find ways to communicate well

248
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:06,120
can one find ways to communicate well
 

249
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,510
can one find ways to communicate well
the best example we have of this right

250
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:08,520
the best example we have of this right
 

251
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,420
the best example we have of this right
now is AI I mean that's our first sort

252
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:11,430
now is AI I mean that's our first sort
 

253
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,029
now is AI I mean that's our first sort
of example of alien intelligence and the

254
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:14,039
of example of alien intelligence and the
 

255
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:15,650
of example of alien intelligence and the
question is how well do we communicate

256
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:15,660
question is how well do we communicate
 

257
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,350
question is how well do we communicate
with AI you know if you were to say if

258
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:18,360
with AI you know if you were to say if
 

259
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,879
with AI you know if you were to say if
you were in the middle of a neural net

260
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:19,889
you were in the middle of a neural net
 

261
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:23,120
you were in the middle of a neural net
and you open it up and it's like what

262
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,130
and you open it up and it's like what
 

263
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,100
and you open it up and it's like what
are you thinking can you discuss things

264
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,110
are you thinking can you discuss things
 

265
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,589
are you thinking can you discuss things
with it it's not easy but it's not

266
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:27,599
with it it's not easy but it's not
 

267
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:30,080
with it it's not easy but it's not
absolutely impossible so I think I think

268
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,090
absolutely impossible so I think I think
 

269
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,960
absolutely impossible so I think I think
by the time but given the setup of your

270
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:32,970
by the time but given the setup of your
 

271
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,960
by the time but given the setup of your
question aliens visiting I think the

272
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:35,970
question aliens visiting I think the
 

273
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,480
question aliens visiting I think the
answer is yes one will be able to find

274
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:38,490
answer is yes one will be able to find
 

275
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,890
answer is yes one will be able to find
some form of communication whatever

276
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:39,900
some form of communication whatever
 

277
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,510
some form of communication whatever
communication means communication

278
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:41,520
communication means communication
 

279
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,850
communication means communication
requires notions of purpose and things

280
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:43,860
requires notions of purpose and things
 

281
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,560
requires notions of purpose and things
like this it's a kind of philosophical

282
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:45,570
like this it's a kind of philosophical
 

283
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:49,029
like this it's a kind of philosophical
quagmire so if AI is a kind of alien

284
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:49,039
quagmire so if AI is a kind of alien
 

285
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,430
quagmire so if AI is a kind of alien
life-form what do you think

286
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:52,440
life-form what do you think
 

287
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,790
life-form what do you think
visiting looks like so if we look at a

288
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:54,800
visiting looks like so if we look at a
 

289
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,279
visiting looks like so if we look at a
Lian's visiting yeah and we'll get to

290
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:58,289
Lian's visiting yeah and we'll get to
 

291
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:00,680
Lian's visiting yeah and we'll get to
discuss computation and and the world of

292
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:00,690
discuss computation and and the world of
 

293
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,600
discuss computation and and the world of
computation but if you were to imagine

294
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:02,610
computation but if you were to imagine
 

295
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,370
computation but if you were to imagine
you said you're already prejudiced

296
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:04,380
you said you're already prejudiced
 

297
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,860
you said you're already prejudiced
something by saying you visit but what

298
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:06,870
something by saying you visit but what
 

299
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,189
something by saying you visit but what
how would a lian's visit by visit

300
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:10,199
how would a lian's visit by visit
 

301
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,409
how would a lian's visit by visit
there's kind of an implication and here

302
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:12,419
there's kind of an implication and here
 

303
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:14,330
there's kind of an implication and here
we're using the imprecision of human

304
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:14,340
we're using the imprecision of human
 

305
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,310
we're using the imprecision of human
language you know in a world of the

306
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:16,320
language you know in a world of the
 

307
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,439
language you know in a world of the
future and if that's represented in

308
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:18,449
future and if that's represented in
 

309
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:20,659
future and if that's represented in
computational language we might be able

310
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:20,669
computational language we might be able
 

311
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:24,140
computational language we might be able
to take the the concept visit and go

312
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,150
to take the the concept visit and go
 

313
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,240
to take the the concept visit and go
look in the documentation basically and

314
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,250
look in the documentation basically and
 

315
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,620
look in the documentation basically and
find out exactly what does that mean

316
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:27,630
find out exactly what does that mean
 

317
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,149
find out exactly what does that mean
what properties does it have and so on

318
00:06:29,149 --> 00:06:29,159
what properties does it have and so on
 

319
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:30,890
what properties does it have and so on
but by visit

320
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:30,900
but by visit
 

321
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,080
but by visit
in ordinary human language I'm kind of

322
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,090
in ordinary human language I'm kind of
 

323
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,770
in ordinary human language I'm kind of
taking it to be there's you know

324

taking it to be there's you know
 

325
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,810
taking it to be there's you know
something a physical embodiment that

326
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:38,820
something a physical embodiment that
 

327
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,030
something a physical embodiment that
shows up in a spacecraft since we kind

328
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:41,040
shows up in a spacecraft since we kind
 

329
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,850
shows up in a spacecraft since we kind
of know that that's necessary

330
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:43,860
of know that that's necessary
 

331
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,840
of know that that's necessary
we're not imagining it's just you know

332
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:47,850
we're not imagining it's just you know
 

333
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,460
we're not imagining it's just you know
photons showing up in a radio signal

334
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:49,470
photons showing up in a radio signal
 

335
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,550
photons showing up in a radio signal
that you know photons in some very

336
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:52,560
that you know photons in some very
 

337
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,230
that you know photons in some very
elaborate pattern we're imagining it's

338
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,240
elaborate pattern we're imagining it's
 

339
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,020
elaborate pattern we're imagining it's
it's physical things made of atoms and

340
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:57,030
it's physical things made of atoms and
 

341
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,840
it's physical things made of atoms and
so on that that show up can't be photons

342
00:06:59,840 --> 00:06:59,850
so on that that show up can't be photons
 

343
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,900
so on that that show up can't be photons
in a pattern well that's good question I

344
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:02,910
in a pattern well that's good question I
 

345
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,270
in a pattern well that's good question I
mean whether there is the possibility

346
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:04,280
mean whether there is the possibility
 

347
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,010
mean whether there is the possibility
you know what counts as intelligence

good question I mean it's some you know

351
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,950
good question I mean it's some you know

00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,270
very elaborate radio signals you know is
that something that we should think of

that something that we should think of

I think it's a I think in the end you

I think it's a I think in the end you
 

463
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:10,760
I think it's a I think in the end you
know when people talk about

00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:10,770
know when people talk about
 

465
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,620
know when people talk about
extraterrestrial intelligence and where

466
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:12,630
extraterrestrial intelligence and where
 

467
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,180
extraterrestrial intelligence and where
is it in the whole you know Fermi

468
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:14,190
is it in the whole you know Fermi
 

469
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,630
is it in the whole you know Fermi
paradox of how come there's no other

470
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:16,640

471
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,640
paradox of how come there's no other
signs of intelligence in the universe my

472
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:19,650
signs of intelligence in the universe my
 

473
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,030
signs of intelligence in the universe my
guess is that we've got sort of two

474
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,040
guess is that we've got sort of two
 

475
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,010
guess is that we've got sort of two
alien forms of intelligence that we're

476
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:25,020
alien forms of intelligence that we're
 

477
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,820
alien forms of intelligence that we're
dealing with artificial intelligence and

478
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:27,830
dealing with artificial intelligence and
 

479
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,350
dealing with artificial intelligence and
sort of physical or extraterrestrial

480
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:30,360
sort of physical or extraterrestrial
 

481
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,140
sort of physical or extraterrestrial
intelligence and my guess is people will

482
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:33,150
intelligence and my guess is people will
 

483
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,490
intelligence and my guess is people will
sort of get comfortable with the fact

484
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:34,500
sort of get comfortable with the fact
 

485
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,490
sort of get comfortable with the fact
that both of these have been achieved

486
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:36,500
that both of these have been achieved
 

487
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,980
that both of these have been achieved
around the same time and in other words

488
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:39,990
around the same time and in other words
 

489
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,290
around the same time and in other words
people will say well yes we're used to

490
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:42,300
people will say well yes we're used to
 

491
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,380
people will say well yes we're used to
computers things we've created digital

492
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:45,390
computers things we've created digital
 

493
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,700
computers things we've created digital
things we've created being sort of

494
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:46,710
things we've created being sort of
 

495
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,740
things we've created being sort of
intelligent like we are and they'll sell

496
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:48,750
intelligent like we are and they'll sell
 

497
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,630
intelligent like we are and they'll sell
we're kind of also used to the idea that

498
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
we're kind of also used to the idea that
 

499
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,980
we're kind of also used to the idea that
there are things around the universe

500
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:51,990
there are things around the universe
 

501
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,500
there are things around the universe
that are kind of intelligent like we are

502
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:54,510
that are kind of intelligent like we are
 

503
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,830
that are kind of intelligent like we are
except they don't share the sort of

504
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:57,840
except they don't share the sort of
 

505
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,900
except they don't share the sort of
civilizational history that we have and

506
00:09:59,900 --> 00:09:59,910
civilizational history that we have and
 

507
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,570
civilizational history that we have and
so we don't they know they're they're a

508
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:02,580
so we don't they know they're they're a
 

509
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,290
so we don't they know they're they're a
different branch

510
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:03,300
different branch
 

511
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,150
different branch
I mean it's similar to when you talk

512
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,160
I mean it's similar to when you talk
 

513
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,430
I mean it's similar to when you talk
about life for instance I mean you you

514
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
about life for instance I mean you you
 

515
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,200
about life for instance I mean you you
you kind of said life form I think

516
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,210
you kind of said life form I think
 

517
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,450
you kind of said life form I think
almost synonymously with intelligence

518
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:11,460
almost synonymously with intelligence
 

519
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,030
almost synonymously with intelligence
which I don't think is is some you know

520
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,040
which I don't think is is some you know
 

521
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,270
which I don't think is is some you know
I the the a eyes will be upset to hear

522
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:17,280
I the the a eyes will be upset to hear
 

523
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,510
I the the a eyes will be upset to hear
you I wait those guys I really probably

524
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:20,520
you I wait those guys I really probably
 

525
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,990
you I wait those guys I really probably
implied biological life right right

526
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
implied biological life right right
 

527
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,580
implied biological life right right
right but you're saying I mean we'll

528
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:25,590
right but you're saying I mean we'll
 

529
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,650
right but you're saying I mean we'll
explore this more but you're saying it's

530
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:27,660
explore this more but you're saying it's
 

531
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,330
explore this more but you're saying it's
really a spectrum and it's all just the

532
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:29,340
really a spectrum and it's all just the
 

533
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,940
really a spectrum and it's all just the
kind of computation and so it's it's a

534
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:31,950
kind of computation and so it's it's a
 

535
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,180
kind of computation and so it's it's a
full spectrum and we just make ourselves

536
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:35,190
full spectrum and we just make ourselves
 

537
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,240
full spectrum and we just make ourselves
special by weaving a narrative around

538
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,250
special by weaving a narrative around
 

539
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,790
special by weaving a narrative around
our particular kinds of computation yes

540
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:40,800
our particular kinds of computation yes
 

541
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,740
our particular kinds of computation yes
I mean what the thing that I think I've

542
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:42,750
I mean what the thing that I think I've
 

543
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,990
I mean what the thing that I think I've
kind of come to realize is you know it's

544
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:45,000
kind of come to realize is you know it's
 

545
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,910
kind of come to realize is you know it's
a little depressing to realize that

546
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:46,920
a little depressing to realize that
 

547
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,650
a little depressing to realize that
there's there's so little it's

548
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:48,660
there's there's so little it's
 

549
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,230
there's there's so little it's
liberating well yeah but I mean it's you

550
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:51,240
liberating well yeah but I mean it's you
 

551
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,850
liberating well yeah but I mean it's you
know it's the story of science right in

552
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:52,860
know it's the story of science right in
 

553
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,820
know it's the story of science right in
you know from Copernicus on it's like

554
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:55,830
you know from Copernicus on it's like
 

555
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,249
you know from Copernicus on it's like
you know first we were like convinced a

556
00:10:58,249 --> 00:10:58,259
you know first we were like convinced a
 

557
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:00,469
you know first we were like convinced a
planets at the center of the universe no

558
00:11:00,469 --> 00:11:00,479
planets at the center of the universe no
 

559
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,119
planets at the center of the universe no
that's not true well then we will

560
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:02,129
that's not true well then we will
 

561
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,349
that's not true well then we will
convince there something very special

562
00:11:03,349 --> 00:11:03,359
convince there something very special
 

563
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:05,539
convince there something very special
about the chemistry that we have as

564
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:05,549
about the chemistry that we have as
 

565
00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:07,429
about the chemistry that we have as
biological organisms now that's not

566
00:11:07,429 --> 00:11:07,439
biological organisms now that's not
 

567
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:09,889
biological organisms now that's not
really true and then we're still holding

568
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:09,899
really true and then we're still holding
 

569
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,900
really true and then we're still holding
out that hope or this intelligence thing

570
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:11,910
out that hope or this intelligence thing
 

571
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,819
out that hope or this intelligence thing
we have that's really special yeah I

572
00:11:13,819 --> 00:11:13,829
we have that's really special yeah I
 

573
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:17,179
we have that's really special yeah I
don't think it is however in a sense as

574
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:17,189
don't think it is however in a sense as
 

575
00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:18,889
don't think it is however in a sense as
you say it's kind of liberating for the

576
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:18,899
you say it's kind of liberating for the
 

577
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:20,449
you say it's kind of liberating for the
following reason that you realize that

578
00:11:20,449 --> 00:11:20,459
following reason that you realize that
 

579
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:25,449
following reason that you realize that
what's special is the details of us not

580
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:25,459
what's special is the details of us not
 

581
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:29,929
what's special is the details of us not
some abstract attribute that you know we

582
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:29,939
some abstract attribute that you know we
 

583
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,460
some abstract attribute that you know we
could wonder Oh is something else going

584
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:31,470
could wonder Oh is something else going
 

585
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,529
could wonder Oh is something else going
to come along and you know also have

586
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:33,539
to come along and you know also have
 

587
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:35,719
to come along and you know also have
that abstract attribute well

588
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:35,729
that abstract attribute well
 

589
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,549
that abstract attribute well
yes every abstract attribute we have

590
00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:37,559
yes every abstract attribute we have
 

591
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:40,219
yes every abstract attribute we have
something else has it but the full

592
00:11:40,219 --> 00:11:40,229
something else has it but the full
 

593
00:11:40,229 --> 00:11:43,009
something else has it but the full
details of our kind of history of our

594
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:43,019
details of our kind of history of our
 

595
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:45,019
details of our kind of history of our
civilization and so on nothing else has

596
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:45,029
civilization and so on nothing else has
 

597
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:47,719
civilization and so on nothing else has
that that's what you know that's our

598
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:47,729
that that's what you know that's our
 

599
00:11:47,729 --> 00:11:50,479
that that's what you know that's our
story so to speak and that's sort of one

600
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:50,489
story so to speak and that's sort of one
 

601
00:11:50,489 --> 00:11:51,349
story so to speak and that's sort of one
most by definition

602
00:11:51,349 --> 00:11:51,359
most by definition
 

603
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:55,039
most by definition
special so I I view it as not being such

604
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:55,049
special so I I view it as not being such
 

605
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:57,650
special so I I view it as not being such
a I mean I was initially I was like this

606
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:57,660
a I mean I was initially I was like this
 

607
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,989
a I mean I was initially I was like this
is bad this is this is kind of you know

608
00:11:59,989 --> 00:11:59,999
is bad this is this is kind of you know
 

609
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:02,179
is bad this is this is kind of you know
how can we have self-respect about some

610
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:02,189
how can we have self-respect about some
 

611
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:04,579
how can we have self-respect about some
about the things that we do then I

612
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:04,589
about the things that we do then I
 

613
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:06,409
about the things that we do then I
realized the details of the things we do

614
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:06,419
realized the details of the things we do
 

615
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:08,840
realized the details of the things we do
they are the story everything else is

616
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:08,850
they are the story everything else is
 

617
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:13,369
they are the story everything else is
kind of a blank canvas so maybe on a

618
00:12:13,369 --> 00:12:13,379
kind of a blank canvas so maybe on a
 

619
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:15,590
kind of a blank canvas so maybe on a
small tangent you just made me think of

620
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:15,600
small tangent you just made me think of
 

621
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,960
small tangent you just made me think of
it but what do you make of the monolith

622
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:17,970
it but what do you make of the monolith
 

623
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,829
it but what do you make of the monolith
in 2001 Space Odyssey in terms of aliens

624
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:21,839
in 2001 Space Odyssey in terms of aliens
 

625
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,220
in 2001 Space Odyssey in terms of aliens
communicating with us and sparking the

626
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:25,230
communicating with us and sparking the
 

627
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,379
communicating with us and sparking the
the kind of particular intelligent

628
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:27,389
the kind of particular intelligent
 

629
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:29,749
the kind of particular intelligent
computation that we humans have is there

630
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:29,759
computation that we humans have is there
 

631
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,400
computation that we humans have is there
anything interesting to get from that

632
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:33,410
anything interesting to get from that
 

633
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:37,220
anything interesting to get from that
sci-fi yeah I mean I think what's what's

634
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:37,230
sci-fi yeah I mean I think what's what's
 

635
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,889
sci-fi yeah I mean I think what's what's
fun about that is you know the monoliths

636
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:39,899
fun about that is you know the monoliths
 

637
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:41,720
fun about that is you know the monoliths
are these you know one to four to nine

638
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:41,730
are these you know one to four to nine
 

639
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,769
are these you know one to four to nine
perfect cuboid things and in the you

640
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:45,779
perfect cuboid things and in the you
 

641
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:46,939
perfect cuboid things and in the you
know earth four million years ago

642
00:12:46,939 --> 00:12:46,949
know earth four million years ago
 

643
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:48,979
know earth four million years ago
whatever they will pertain with a bunch

644
00:12:48,979 --> 00:12:48,989
whatever they will pertain with a bunch
 

645
00:12:48,989 --> 00:12:49,970
whatever they will pertain with a bunch
of apes and so on

646
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:49,980
of apes and so on
 

647
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,889
of apes and so on
a thing that has that level of

648
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:51,899
a thing that has that level of
 

649
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:55,309
a thing that has that level of
perfection seems out of place it seems

650
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:55,319
perfection seems out of place it seems
 

651
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:59,439
perfection seems out of place it seems
very kind of constructed very engineered

652
00:12:59,439 --> 00:12:59,449
very kind of constructed very engineered
 

653
00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:01,699
very kind of constructed very engineered
so that's an interesting question what

654
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:01,709
so that's an interesting question what
 

655
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:03,229
so that's an interesting question what
is the you know what's the techno

656
00:13:03,229 --> 00:13:03,239
is the you know what's the techno
 

657
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:05,689
is the you know what's the techno
signature so to speak what is it that

658
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:05,699
signature so to speak what is it that
 

659
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:08,269
signature so to speak what is it that
you see it somewhere and you say my gosh

660
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:08,279
you see it somewhere and you say my gosh
 

661
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:11,059
you see it somewhere and you say my gosh
that had to be engineered um now the

662
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:11,069
that had to be engineered um now the
 

663
00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:12,020
that had to be engineered um now the
fact is

664
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:12,030
fact is
 

665
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,330
fact is
we see crystals which are also very

666
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:14,340
we see crystals which are also very
 

667
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,850
we see crystals which are also very
perfect and you know that the perfect

668
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:16,860
perfect and you know that the perfect
 

669
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,170
perfect and you know that the perfect
ones are very perfect they're nice

670
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:18,180
ones are very perfect they're nice
 

671
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,260
ones are very perfect they're nice
polyhedra or whatever um and so in that

672
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:21,270
polyhedra or whatever um and so in that
 

673
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,410
polyhedra or whatever um and so in that
sense if you say well it's a sign of

674
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:23,420
sense if you say well it's a sign of
 

675
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,540
sense if you say well it's a sign of
sort of it's a techno signature that

676
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:26,550
sort of it's a techno signature that
 

677
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,820
sort of it's a techno signature that
it's a perfect you know a perfect

678
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:28,830
it's a perfect you know a perfect
 

679
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,430
it's a perfect you know a perfect
polygonal shape polyhedral shape that's

680
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:31,440
polygonal shape polyhedral shape that's
 

681
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,070
polygonal shape polyhedral shape that's
not true and so then it's it's an

682
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:34,080
not true and so then it's it's an
 

683
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,770
not true and so then it's it's an
interesting question what what is the

684
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:36,780
interesting question what what is the
 

685
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,360
interesting question what what is the
you know what is the right signature I

686
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:38,370
you know what is the right signature I
 

687
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,580
you know what is the right signature I
mean like you know Gauss famous

688
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:40,590
mean like you know Gauss famous
 

689
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,470
mean like you know Gauss famous
mathematician you know he had this idea

690
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:42,480
mathematician you know he had this idea
 

691
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,170

you should cut down the Siberian forest

692
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:45,180
you should cut down the Siberian forest
 

693
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,450
you should cut down the Siberian forest
in the shape of sort of a typical image

694
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:47,460
in the shape of sort of a typical image

you send something you think it's
 

737
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,720
you send something you think it's
fantastic but it's kind of like we are

738
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:41,730
fantastic but it's kind of like we are
 

739
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,730

00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,240
these elaborate things we create is
 

751
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,600
these elaborate things we create is
surprisingly ubiquitous in other words

752
00:14:59,600 --> 00:14:59,610
surprisingly ubiquitous in other words
 

753
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:02,180
surprisingly ubiquitous in other words
we might have thought that you know

754
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:02,190
we might have thought that you know
 

755
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,790
we might have thought that you know
we've built this whole giant engineering

756
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:04,800
we've built this whole giant engineering
 

757
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,560
we've built this whole giant engineering
stack that's led us to microprocessors

758
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:06,570
stack that's led us to microprocessors
 

759
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,170
stack that's led us to microprocessors
that's led us to be able to do elaborate

760
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:09,180
that's led us to be able to do elaborate
 

761
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,410
that's led us to be able to do elaborate
computations but this idea the

762
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:12,420
computations but this idea the
 

763
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,210
computations but this idea the
computations are happening all over the

764
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:14,220
computations are happening all over the
 

765
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,190
computations are happening all over the
place the only question is whether

766
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:16,200
place the only question is whether
 

767
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,200
place the only question is whether
whether there's a thread that connects

768
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:18,210
whether there's a thread that connects
 

769
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,170
whether there's a thread that connects
our human intentions to what those

770
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:21,180
our human intentions to what those
 

771
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,990
our human intentions to what those
computations are and so I think I think

772
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,000
computations are and so I think I think
 

773
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,870
computations are and so I think I think
this question of what do you send

774
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:25,880
this question of what do you send
 

775
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,900
this question of what do you send
to kind of show off our civilization in

776
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:28,910
to kind of show off our civilization in
 

777
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,810
to kind of show off our civilization in
the best possible way I think any kind

778
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:31,820
the best possible way I think any kind
 

779
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,420
the best possible way I think any kind
of almost random slab of stuff we've

780
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:34,430
of almost random slab of stuff we've
 

781
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,510
of almost random slab of stuff we've
produced is about equivalent to

782
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:37,520
produced is about equivalent to
 

783
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,890
produced is about equivalent to
everything else I think it's one of

784
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:38,900
everything else I think it's one of
 

785
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,200
everything else I think it's one of
these things where it's a non romantic

786
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,210
these things where it's a non romantic
 

787
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:44,230
these things where it's a non romantic
way of phrasing it I just started to

788
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,240
way of phrasing it I just started to
 

789
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,640
way of phrasing it I just started to
interrupt but I just talked to it up

790
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:45,650
interrupt but I just talked to it up
 

791
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:48,670
interrupt but I just talked to it up
Andrew in who's the wife of cross

795
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,720
hanging uh-huh and so I don't know if
you're familiar with the Voyager it's

796
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:52,730
you're familiar with the Voyager it's
 

797
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:55,330
you're familiar with the Voyager it's
just part of its ascending I think

798
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:55,340
just part of its ascending I think
 

799
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,960
just part of its ascending I think
brainwaves of you know I wasn't it hers

800
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:58,970
brainwaves of you know I wasn't it hers
 

801
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,720
brainwaves of you know I wasn't it hers
it was yeah her brain waves when she was

802
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:01,730
it was yeah her brain waves when she was
 

803
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,010
it was yeah her brain waves when she was
first falling in love with Carl Sagan

804
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:03,020
first falling in love with Carl Sagan
 

805
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,370
first falling in love with Carl Sagan
right it's this beautiful story right

806
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:06,380
right it's this beautiful story right
 

807
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,410
right it's this beautiful story right
that brand that perhaps you would shut

808
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:08,420
that brand that perhaps you would shut
 

809
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,200
that brand that perhaps you would shut
down the power of that by saying we

810
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,210
down the power of that by saying we
 

811
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,550
down the power of that by saying we
might as well send anything else and

812
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:12,560
might as well send anything else and
 

813
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,920
might as well send anything else and
that's interesting all of it is kind of

814
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:14,930
that's interesting all of it is kind of
 

815
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,560
that's interesting all of it is kind of
an interesting peculiar thing that's

816
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:17,570
an interesting peculiar thing that's
 

817
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,360
an interesting peculiar thing that's
yeah yeah right well I mean I think it's

818
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:19,370
yeah yeah right well I mean I think it's
 

819
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,770
yeah yeah right well I mean I think it's
kind of interesting to see on the on the

820
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:20,780
kind of interesting to see on the on the
 

821
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,290
kind of interesting to see on the on the
Voyager you know golden record thing one

822
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:23,300
Voyager you know golden record thing one
 

823
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,490
Voyager you know golden record thing one
of the things that's kind of cute about

824
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:24,500
of the things that's kind of cute about
 

825
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,770
of the things that's kind of cute about
that is you know it was made one was it

826
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:26,780
that is you know it was made one was it
 

827
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,390
that is you know it was made one was it
in the late seventies early eighties

828
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:28,400
in the late seventies early eighties
 

829
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,060
in the late seventies early eighties
yeah um and you know one of the things

830
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,070
yeah um and you know one of the things
 

831
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,610
yeah um and you know one of the things
it's a phonograph record okay

832
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:33,620
it's a phonograph record okay
 

833
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,200
it's a phonograph record okay
and it has a diagram how to play a

834
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,210
and it has a diagram how to play a
 

835
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:38,230
and it has a diagram how to play a
phonograph record and you know it's kind

836
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:38,240
phonograph record and you know it's kind
 

837
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,270
phonograph record and you know it's kind
of like it's shocking that in just 30

838
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:40,280
of like it's shocking that in just 30
 

839
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,150
of like it's shocking that in just 30
years if you show that to a random kid

840
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:43,160
years if you show that to a random kid
 

841
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,860
years if you show that to a random kid
of today and you show them that diagram

842
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:44,870
of today and you show them that diagram
 

843
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,750
of today and you show them that diagram
I've tried this experiment they're like

844
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:46,760
I've tried this experiment they're like
 

845
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,180
I've tried this experiment they're like
I don't know what the heck this is and

846
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:49,190
I don't know what the heck this is and
 

847
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,340
I don't know what the heck this is and
the best anybody can think of is you

848
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:51,350
the best anybody can think of is you
 

849
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,930
the best anybody can think of is you
know take the whole record forget the

850
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:52,940
know take the whole record forget the
 

851
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,130
know take the whole record forget the
fact that it has some kind of helical

852
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:54,140
fact that it has some kind of helical
 

853
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,740
fact that it has some kind of helical
track in it just image the whole thing

854
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:56,750
track in it just image the whole thing
 

855
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,690
track in it just image the whole thing
and see what's there that's what we

856
00:16:58,690 --> 00:16:58,700
and see what's there that's what we
 

857
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,390
and see what's there that's what we
would do today in only 30 years our

858
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:01,400
would do today in only 30 years our
 

859
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,580
would do today in only 30 years our
technology has kind of advanced to the

860
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:03,590
technology has kind of advanced to the
 

861
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,890
technology has kind of advanced to the
point where the playing of a helical you

862
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:05,900
point where the playing of a helical you
 

863
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,929
point where the playing of a helical you
know mechanical track on a phonograph

864
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:07,939
know mechanical track on a phonograph
 

865
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:11,559
know mechanical track on a phonograph
record is now something bizarre so you

866
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:11,569
record is now something bizarre so you
 

867
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:13,390
record is now something bizarre so you
know it's it's that's a cautionary tale

868
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:13,400
know it's it's that's a cautionary tale
 

869
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,870
know it's it's that's a cautionary tale
I would say in terms of the ability to

870
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:15,880
I would say in terms of the ability to
 

871
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,840
I would say in terms of the ability to
make something that in detail sort of

872
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:19,850
make something that in detail sort of
 

873
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,569
make something that in detail sort of
leads by the nose some you know the

874
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:22,579
leads by the nose some you know the
 

875
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:24,939
leads by the nose some you know the
aliens or whatever to do something it's

876
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:24,949
aliens or whatever to do something it's
 

877
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:27,819
aliens or whatever to do something it's
like no you know best you can do as I

878
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:27,829
like no you know best you can do as I
 

879
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:30,280
like no you know best you can do as I
say if we were doing this today we would

880
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:30,290
say if we were doing this today we would
 

881
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,160
say if we were doing this today we would
not build a helical scan thing with a

882
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,170
not build a helical scan thing with a
 

883
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,440
not build a helical scan thing with a
needle we would just take some high

884
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:35,450
needle we would just take some high
 

885
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,420
needle we would just take some high
resolution imaging system and get all

886
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:37,430
resolution imaging system and get all
 

887
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,810
resolution imaging system and get all
the bits off it

888
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:38,820
the bits off it
 

889
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,399
the bits off it
say oh it's a big nuisance that they put

890
00:17:40,399 --> 00:17:40,409
say oh it's a big nuisance that they put
 

891
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:43,430
say oh it's a big nuisance that they put
in a helix you know the spiral let's sum

892
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:43,440
in a helix you know the spiral let's sum
 

893
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,340
in a helix you know the spiral let's sum
let's just you know unravel the spiral

894
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:46,350
let's just you know unravel the spiral
 

895
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:50,889
let's just you know unravel the spiral
and then start from there do you think

896
00:17:50,889 --> 00:17:50,899
and then start from there do you think
 

897
00:17:50,899 --> 00:17:53,690
and then start from there do you think
and this will get into trying to figure

898
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:53,700
and this will get into trying to figure
 

899
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,480
and this will get into trying to figure
out interpretability of AI

900
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:56,490
out interpretability of AI

able to communicate with various kinds

904
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:01,620
able to communicate with various kinds
 

905
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,139
able to communicate with various kinds
of computations do you think would be

906
00:18:03,139 --> 00:18:03,149
of computations do you think would be
 

907
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:05,720
of computations do you think would be
able to if you're put put your alien hat

908
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:05,730
able to if you're put put your alien hat
 

909
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:09,620
able to if you're put put your alien hat
on figure out this record how to play

910
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:09,630
on figure out this record how to play
 

911
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,529
on figure out this record how to play
this record well it's a question of what

912
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:12,539
this record well it's a question of what
 

913
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:15,529
this record well it's a question of what
one wants to do I mean understand what

914
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:15,539
one wants to do I mean understand what
 

915
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:17,480
one wants to do I mean understand what
the other party was trying to

916
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:17,490
the other party was trying to
 

917
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,580
the other party was trying to
communicate or understand anything about

918
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:19,590
communicate or understand anything about
 

919
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,379
communicate or understand anything about
the other party what is understanding

920
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:21,389
the other party what is understanding
 

921
00:18:21,389 --> 00:18:23,149
the other party what is understanding
mean I mean that's the issue the issue

922
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:23,159
mean I mean that's the issue the issue
 

923
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:25,159
mean I mean that's the issue the issue
is it's like what people were trying to

924
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:25,169
is it's like what people were trying to
 

925
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:27,379
is it's like what people were trying to
do natural language understanding for

926
00:18:27,379 --> 00:18:27,389
do natural language understanding for
 

927
00:18:27,389 --> 00:18:30,710
do natural language understanding for
computers right so people try to do that

928
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:30,720
computers right so people try to do that
 

929
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,960
computers right so people try to do that
for years it wasn't clear what it meant

930
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:32,970
for years it wasn't clear what it meant
 

931
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,990
for years it wasn't clear what it meant
in other words you take your piece of

932
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,000
in other words you take your piece of
 

933
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,240
in other words you take your piece of
English or whatever and you say gosh my

934
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,250
English or whatever and you say gosh my
 

935
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,820
English or whatever and you say gosh my
computer has understood this okay that's

936
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:40,830
computer has understood this okay that's
 

937
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,639
computer has understood this okay that's
nice what can you do with that well so

938
00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:43,649
nice what can you do with that well so
 

939
00:18:43,649 --> 00:18:46,190
nice what can you do with that well so
for example when we did you know built

940
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:46,200
for example when we did you know built
 

941
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,769
for example when we did you know built
wolf malphur um you know one of the

942
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:48,779
wolf malphur um you know one of the
 

943
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:50,990
wolf malphur um you know one of the
things was it's you know it's doing

944
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:51,000
things was it's you know it's doing
 

945
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,789
things was it's you know it's doing
question answering and so on it needs to

946
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:52,799
question answering and so on it needs to
 

947
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,619
question answering and so on it needs to
do natural language understanding the

948
00:18:54,619 --> 00:18:54,629
do natural language understanding the
 

949
00:18:54,629 --> 00:18:57,169
do natural language understanding the
reason that I realized after the fact

950
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:57,179
reason that I realized after the fact
 

951
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,119
reason that I realized after the fact
the reason we were able to do natural

952
00:18:59,119 --> 00:18:59,129
the reason we were able to do natural
 

953
00:18:59,129 --> 00:19:00,919
the reason we were able to do natural
language understanding quite well and

954
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:00,929
language understanding quite well and
 

955
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:03,889
language understanding quite well and
people hadn't before the number one

956
00:19:03,889 --> 00:19:03,899
people hadn't before the number one
 

957
00:19:03,899 --> 00:19:07,009
people hadn't before the number one
thing was we had an actual objective for

958
00:19:07,009 --> 00:19:07,019
thing was we had an actual objective for
 

959
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:08,210
thing was we had an actual objective for
the natural language understand and we

960
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:08,220
the natural language understand and we
 

961
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,769
the natural language understand and we
were trying to turn the natural language

962
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:09,779
were trying to turn the natural language
 

963
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:11,029
were trying to turn the natural language
into commentation into this

964
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:11,039
into commentation into this
 

965
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,889
into commentation into this
computational language that we could

966
00:19:12,889 --> 00:19:12,899
computational language that we could
 

967
00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:15,169
computational language that we could
then do things with now similarly when

968
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:15,179
then do things with now similarly when
 

969
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:17,419
then do things with now similarly when
you imagine your alien you say okay

970
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:17,429
you imagine your alien you say okay
 

971
00:19:17,429 --> 00:19:19,279
you imagine your alien you say okay
we're playing them the record did they

972
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:19,289
we're playing them the record did they
 

973
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:21,799
we're playing them the record did they
understand it well it depends what you

974
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:21,809
understand it well it depends what you
 

975
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:23,570
understand it well it depends what you
mean if they you know if we if there's a

976
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:23,580
mean if they you know if we if there's a
 

977
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,940
mean if they you know if we if there's a
representation that they have if it

978
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:25,950
representation that they have if it
 

979
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,860
representation that they have if it
converts to some representation where we

980
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:27,870
converts to some representation where we
 

981
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,680
converts to some representation where we
can say oh yes that is a that's a

982
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:30,690
can say oh yes that is a that's a
 

983
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,610
can say oh yes that is a that's a
representation that we can recognize is

984
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:33,620
representation that we can recognize is
 

985
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,899
representation that we can recognize is
represents understanding then all well

986
00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:35,909
represents understanding then all well
 

987
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:38,149
represents understanding then all well
and good but actually the only ones that

988
00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:38,159
and good but actually the only ones that
 

989
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:40,310
and good but actually the only ones that
I think we can say would represent

990
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,320
I think we can say would represent
 

991
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,529
I think we can say would represent
understanding a ones that will then do

992
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:42,539
understanding a ones that will then do
 

993
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:45,289
understanding a ones that will then do
things that we humans kind of recognize

994
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:45,299
things that we humans kind of recognize
 

995
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:48,669
things that we humans kind of recognize
as being useful to us maybe a trying to

996
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:48,679
as being useful to us maybe a trying to
 

997
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:51,919
as being useful to us maybe a trying to
understand quantify how

998
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:51,929
understand quantify how
 

999
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:53,509
understand quantify how
technological advances particular

1000
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:53,519
technological advances particular
 

1001
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:56,029
technological advances particular
civilization is so are they a threat to

1002
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:56,039
civilization is so are they a threat to
 

1003
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:59,210
civilization is so are they a threat to
us from a military perspective yeah yeah

1004
00:19:59,210 --> 00:19:59,220
us from a military perspective yeah yeah
 

1005
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,220
us from a military perspective yeah yeah
that's probably the kind of first kind

1006
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:01,230
that's probably the kind of first kind
 

1007
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,239
that's probably the kind of first kind
of understanding that would be

1008
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:02,249
of understanding that would be
 

1009
00:20:02,249 --> 00:20:04,430
of understanding that would be
interested in gosh that's so hard I mean

1010
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:04,440
interested in gosh that's so hard I mean
 

1011
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,230
interested in gosh that's so hard I mean
that's like in the arrival movie that

1012
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:06,240
that's like in the arrival movie that
 

1013
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,090
that's like in the arrival movie that
was sort of one of the key questions as

1014
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:08,100
was sort of one of the key questions as
 

1015
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,519
was sort of one of the key questions as
is you know why are you here so to speak

1016
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:10,529
is you know why are you here so to speak
 

1017
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:13,820
is you know why are you here so to speak
and it's I using a hurtis right but but

1018
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:13,830
and it's I using a hurtis right but but
 

1019
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,049
and it's I using a hurtis right but but
even that is that you know it's a very

1020
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:15,059
even that is that you know it's a very
 

1021
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:16,999
even that is that you know it's a very
unclear you know it's like the the are

1022
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:17,009
unclear you know it's like the the are
 

1023
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:18,470
unclear you know it's like the the are
you gonna hurt us that comes back to a

1024
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:18,480
you gonna hurt us that comes back to a
 

1025
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,269
you gonna hurt us that comes back to a
lot of interesting area fix questions

1026
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:20,279
lot of interesting area fix questions
 

1027
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:22,730
lot of interesting area fix questions
because the you know we might make an AI

1028
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:22,740
because the you know we might make an AI
 

1029
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,850
because the you know we might make an AI
that says blood take autonomous cars for

1030
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:25,860
that says blood take autonomous cars for
 

1031
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,649
that says blood take autonomous cars for
instance you know are you gonna hurt us

1032
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:27,659
instance you know are you gonna hurt us
 

1033
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,049
instance you know are you gonna hurt us
well let's make sure you only drive at

1034
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:30,059
well let's make sure you only drive at
 

1035
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:31,730
well let's make sure you only drive at
precisely the speed limit because we

1036
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:31,740
precisely the speed limit because we
 

1037
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,019
precisely the speed limit because we
want to make sure we don't hurt you so

1038
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:33,029
want to make sure we don't hurt you so
 

1039
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:34,999
want to make sure we don't hurt you so
to speak because that's some and then

1040
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:35,009
to speak because that's some and then
 

1041
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:37,039
to speak because that's some and then
well something you know but you say but

1042
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:37,049
well something you know but you say but
 

1043
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:38,299
well something you know but you say but
actually that means I'm gonna be really

1044
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:38,309
actually that means I'm gonna be really
 

1045
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:40,310
actually that means I'm gonna be really
late for this thing and you know that

1046
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:40,320
late for this thing and you know that
 

1047
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,830
late for this thing and you know that
sort of hurts me in some way so it's

1048
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:42,840
sort of hurts me in some way so it's
 

1049
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,440
sort of hurts me in some way so it's
hard to know even even the definition of

1050
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:45,450
hard to know even even the definition of
 

1051
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,269
hard to know even even the definition of
what it means to hurt yeah someone is

1052
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:49,279
what it means to hurt yeah someone is
 

1053
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,769
what it means to hurt yeah someone is
unclear and as we start thinking about

1054
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:51,779
unclear and as we start thinking about
 

1055
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:54,409
unclear and as we start thinking about
things about AI ethics and so on that's

1056
00:20:54,409 --> 00:20:54,419
things about AI ethics and so on that's
 

1057
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,539
things about AI ethics and so on that's
you know something one has to address

1058
00:20:56,539 --> 00:20:56,549
you know something one has to address
 

1059
00:20:56,549 --> 00:20:58,519
you know something one has to address
there's always trade-offs and that's the

1060
00:20:58,519 --> 00:20:58,529
there's always trade-offs and that's the
 

1061
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:00,769
there's always trade-offs and that's the
annoying thing about ethics yeah well

1062
00:21:00,769 --> 00:21:00,779
annoying thing about ethics yeah well
 

1063
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:02,629
annoying thing about ethics yeah well
right and I mean I think ethics like

1064
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:02,639
right and I mean I think ethics like
 

1065
00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:03,799
right and I mean I think ethics like
these other things we're talking about

1066
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:03,809
these other things we're talking about
 

1067
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:06,379
these other things we're talking about
is a deeply human thing if there's no

1068
00:21:06,379 --> 00:21:06,389
is a deeply human thing if there's no
 

1069
00:21:06,389 --> 00:21:09,230
is a deeply human thing if there's no
abstract you know let's write down the

1070
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:09,240
abstract you know let's write down the
 

1071
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,480
abstract you know let's write down the
theorem that proves that this is

1072
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:11,490
theorem that proves that this is
 

1073
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,970
theorem that proves that this is
ethically correct that's a that's a

1074
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:13,980
ethically correct that's a that's a
 

1075
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,190
ethically correct that's a that's a
meaningless idea you know you have to

1076
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:16,200
meaningless idea you know you have to
 

1077
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,739
meaningless idea you know you have to
have a ground truth so to speak that's

1078
00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:18,749
have a ground truth so to speak that's
 

1079
00:21:18,749 --> 00:21:22,009
have a ground truth so to speak that's
ultimately sort of what humans want and

1080
00:21:22,009 --> 00:21:22,019
ultimately sort of what humans want and
 

1081
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:24,049
ultimately sort of what humans want and
they don't all want the same thing so

1082
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:24,059
they don't all want the same thing so
 

1083
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:25,489
they don't all want the same thing so
that gives one all kinds of additional

1084
00:21:25,489 --> 00:21:25,499
that gives one all kinds of additional
 

1085
00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:28,129
that gives one all kinds of additional
complexity and thinking about that one

1086
00:21:28,129 --> 00:21:28,139
complexity and thinking about that one
 

1087
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:29,840
complexity and thinking about that one
convenient thing in terms of turning

1088
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:29,850
convenient thing in terms of turning
 

1089
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,850
convenient thing in terms of turning
ethics into computation you ask the

1090
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:31,860
ethics into computation you ask the
 

1091
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,850
ethics into computation you ask the
question of what maximizes the

1092
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:34,860
question of what maximizes the
 

1093
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,710
question of what maximizes the
likelihood of the survival of the

1094
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:36,720
likelihood of the survival of the
 

1095
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,879
likelihood of the survival of the
species that's a good existential issue

1096
00:21:40,879 --> 00:21:40,889
species that's a good existential issue
 

1097
00:21:40,889 --> 00:21:43,700
species that's a good existential issue
but then when you say survival of the

1098
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:43,710
but then when you say survival of the
 

1099
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,450
but then when you say survival of the
species right you might say um you might

1100
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:47,460
species right you might say um you might
 

1101
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,239
species right you might say um you might
for example for example let's say forget

1102
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:50,249
for example for example let's say forget
 

1103
00:21:50,249 --> 00:21:52,580
for example for example let's say forget
about technology just you know hang out

1104
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:52,590
about technology just you know hang out
 

1105
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:55,519
about technology just you know hang out
and you know be happy live our lives go

1106
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:55,529
and you know be happy live our lives go
 

1107
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:57,169
and you know be happy live our lives go
on to the next generation and you know

1108
00:21:57,169 --> 00:21:57,179
on to the next generation and you know
 

1109
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:59,210
on to the next generation and you know
go through many many generations where

1110
00:21:59,210 --> 00:21:59,220
go through many many generations where
 

1111
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,999
go through many many generations where
in a sense nothing is happening that

1112
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:02,009
in a sense nothing is happening that
 

1113
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:04,519
in a sense nothing is happening that
okay is that not okay hard to know in

1114
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:04,529
okay is that not okay hard to know in
 

1115
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:05,860
okay is that not okay hard to know in
terms of

1116
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:05,870
terms of
 

1117
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:09,549
terms of
the attempt to do elaborate things and

1118
00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:09,559
the attempt to do elaborate things and
 

1119
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:11,100
the attempt to do elaborate things and
the attempt to might be

1120
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:11,110
the attempt to might be
 

1121
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:14,529
the attempt to might be
counterproductive for the survival of

1122
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:14,539
counterproductive for the survival of
 

1123
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:15,279
counterproductive for the survival of
the species

1124
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:15,289
the species
 

1125
00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:17,919
the species
like for instance I mean in in you know

1126
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:17,929
like for instance I mean in in you know
 

1127
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:19,720
like for instance I mean in in you know
I think it's it's also a little bit hard

1128
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:19,730
I think it's it's also a little bit hard
 

1129
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:22,750
I think it's it's also a little bit hard
to know so ok let's take that as a sort

1130
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:22,760
to know so ok let's take that as a sort
 

1131
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,669
to know so ok let's take that as a sort
of thought experiment ok you know you

1132
00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:24,679
of thought experiment ok you know you
 

1133
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:28,180
of thought experiment ok you know you
can say well what are the threats that

1134
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:28,190
can say well what are the threats that
 

1135
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:30,190
can say well what are the threats that
we might have to survive you know the

1136
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:30,200
we might have to survive you know the
 

1137
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,640
we might have to survive you know the
supervolcano the asteroid impact the you

1138
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:33,650
supervolcano the asteroid impact the you
 

1139
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,010
supervolcano the asteroid impact the you
know all these kinds of things ok so now

1140
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:36,020
know all these kinds of things ok so now
 

1141
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,019
know all these kinds of things ok so now
we inventory these possible threats and

1142
00:22:38,019 --> 00:22:38,029
we inventory these possible threats and
 

1143
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:40,570
we inventory these possible threats and
we say let's make our species as robust

1144
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:40,580
we say let's make our species as robust
 

1145
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,799
we say let's make our species as robust
as possible relative to all these

1146
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:41,809
as possible relative to all these
 

1147
00:22:41,809 --> 00:22:45,159
as possible relative to all these
threats I think in the end it's a it's

1148
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:45,169
threats I think in the end it's a it's
 

1149
00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:48,669
threats I think in the end it's a it's
sort of an unknowable thing what what it

1150
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:48,679
sort of an unknowable thing what what it
 

1151
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:51,580
sort of an unknowable thing what what it
takes to you know so so given that

1152
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:51,590
takes to you know so so given that
 

1153
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:54,510
takes to you know so so given that
you've got this AI and you've told it

1154
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:54,520
you've got this AI and you've told it
 

1155
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,940
you've got this AI and you've told it
maximize the long term what is long term

1156
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:57,950
maximize the long term what is long term
 

1157
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:00,340
maximize the long term what is long term
mean does long term mean until the sun

1158
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:00,350
mean does long term mean until the sun
 

1159
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,710
mean does long term mean until the sun
burns out that's that's not gonna work

1160
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:02,720
burns out that's that's not gonna work
 

1161
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,590
burns out that's that's not gonna work
and you know does long term mean next

1162
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:05,600
and you know does long term mean next
 

1163
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,840
and you know does long term mean next
thousand years ok they're probably

1164
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:07,850
thousand years ok they're probably
 

1165
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,580
thousand years ok they're probably
optimizations for the next thousand

1166
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:09,590
optimizations for the next thousand
 

1167
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:12,789
optimizations for the next thousand
years that it's like it's like if you're

1168
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:12,799
years that it's like it's like if you're
 

1169
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,320
years that it's like it's like if you're
running a company you can make a company

1170
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:14,330
running a company you can make a company
 

1171
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,029
running a company you can make a company
be very stable for a certain period of

1172
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:16,039
be very stable for a certain period of
 

1173
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:18,430
be very stable for a certain period of
time like if you know if your company

1174
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:18,440
time like if you know if your company
 

1175
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,190
time like if you know if your company
gets bought by some you know private

1176
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:21,200
gets bought by some you know private
 

1177
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,010
gets bought by some you know private
investment group then they'll you know

1178
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:24,020
investment group then they'll you know
 

1179
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,779
investment group then they'll you know
you can you can run a company just fine

1180
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:25,789
you can you can run a company just fine
 

1181
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:28,029
you can you can run a company just fine
for five years by just taking what it

1182
00:23:28,029 --> 00:23:28,039
for five years by just taking what it
 

1183
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:31,049
for five years by just taking what it
does and you know removing all R&D and

1184
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:31,059
does and you know removing all R&D and
 

1185
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:34,120
does and you know removing all R&D and
the company will burn out after a while

1186
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:34,130
the company will burn out after a while
 

1187
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,519
the company will burn out after a while
but it'll run just fine for a while so

1188
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:36,529
but it'll run just fine for a while so
 

1189
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:38,799
but it'll run just fine for a while so
if you tell the AI keep the humans okay

1190
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:38,809
if you tell the AI keep the humans okay
 

1191
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:40,570
if you tell the AI keep the humans okay
for a thousand years there's probably a

1192
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:40,580
for a thousand years there's probably a
 

1193
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,980
for a thousand years there's probably a
certain set of things that one would do

1194
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:41,990
certain set of things that one would do
 

1195
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,380
certain set of things that one would do
to optimize that many of which one might

1196
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:44,390
to optimize that many of which one might
 

1197
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,760
to optimize that many of which one might
say well that would be a pretty big

1198
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:45,770
say well that would be a pretty big
 

1199
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,409
say well that would be a pretty big
shame for the future of history so to

1200
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:47,419
shame for the future of history so to
 

1201
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:49,330
shame for the future of history so to
speak for that to be what happens but I

1202
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:49,340
speak for that to be what happens but I
 

1203
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,159
speak for that to be what happens but I
think I think in the end you know as you

1204
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:51,169
think I think in the end you know as you
 

1205
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:54,930
think I think in the end you know as you
start thinking about that question it is

1206
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:54,940
start thinking about that question it is
 

1207
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,610
start thinking about that question it is
what you realize is there's a whole sort

1208
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:57,620
what you realize is there's a whole sort
 

1209
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:00,460
what you realize is there's a whole sort
of raft of undecidability computational

1210
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:00,470
of raft of undecidability computational
 

1211
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,769
of raft of undecidability computational
irreducibility in other words it's I

1212
00:24:02,769 --> 00:24:02,779
irreducibility in other words it's I
 

1213
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:05,380
irreducibility in other words it's I
mean one of the good things about sort

1214
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:05,390
mean one of the good things about sort
 

1215
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:08,470
mean one of the good things about sort
of the the the what our civilization has

1216
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:08,480
of the the the what our civilization has
 

1217
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,659
of the the the what our civilization has
gone through and what sort of we humans

1218
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:10,669
gone through and what sort of we humans
 

1219
00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:12,279
gone through and what sort of we humans
go through is that there's a certain

1220
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:12,289
go through is that there's a certain
 

1221
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:14,560
go through is that there's a certain
computational irreducibility to it in

1222
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:14,570
computational irreducibility to it in
 

1223
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,630
computational irreducibility to it in
the sense that it isn't the case you can

1224
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:16,640
the sense that it isn't the case you can
 

1225
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,669
the sense that it isn't the case you can
look from the outside and just say the

1226
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:18,679
look from the outside and just say the
 

1227
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:19,870
look from the outside and just say the
answer is going to be this

1228
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:19,880
answer is going to be this
 

1229
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,430
answer is going to be this
at the end of the day this is what's

1230
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:21,440
at the end of the day this is what's
 

1231
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,320
at the end of the day this is what's
gonna happen you actually have to go

1232
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:23,330
gonna happen you actually have to go
 

1233
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,420
gonna happen you actually have to go
through the process to find out and I

1234
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:25,430
through the process to find out and I
 

1235
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,880
through the process to find out and I
think that's um that's both that feels

1236
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:27,890
think that's um that's both that feels
 

1237
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,250
think that's um that's both that feels
better in the sense it's not a you know

1238
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:30,260
better in the sense it's not a you know
 

1239
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,870
better in the sense it's not a you know
something is achieved by going through

1240
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:31,880
something is achieved by going through
 

1241
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:37,290
something is achieved by going through
all of this all of this process and it's

1242
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:37,300
all of this all of this process and it's
 

1243
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,960
all of this all of this process and it's
but it also means that telling the a I

1244
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:39,970
but it also means that telling the a I
 

1245
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:42,940
but it also means that telling the a I
go figure out you know what will be the

1246
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:42,950
go figure out you know what will be the
 

1247
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:45,040
go figure out you know what will be the
best outcome well unfortunately it's

1248
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,050
best outcome well unfortunately it's
 

1249
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,300
best outcome well unfortunately it's
going to come back and say it's kind of

1250
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:46,310
going to come back and say it's kind of
 

1251
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,970
going to come back and say it's kind of
undecidable what to do we'd have to run

1252
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:48,980
undecidable what to do we'd have to run
 

1253
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,760
undecidable what to do we'd have to run
all of those scenarios to see what

1254
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:51,770
all of those scenarios to see what
 

1255
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,620
all of those scenarios to see what
happens and if we want it for the

1256
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:53,630
happens and if we want it for the
 

1257
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,670
happens and if we want it for the
infinite future

1258
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:54,680
infinite future
 

1259
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,370
infinite future
we're throwing immediately into a sort

1260
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:57,380
we're throwing immediately into a sort
 

1261
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,290
we're throwing immediately into a sort
of standard issues of of kind of

1262
00:24:59,290 --> 00:24:59,300
of standard issues of of kind of
 

1263
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,450
of standard issues of of kind of
infinite computation and so on so yeah

1264
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:01,460
infinite computation and so on so yeah
 

1265
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,400
infinite computation and so on so yeah
even if you get that the answer to the

1266
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:03,410
even if you get that the answer to the
 

1267
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,380
even if you get that the answer to the
universe and everything is 42 you still

1268
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:05,390
universe and everything is 42 you still
 

1269
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:09,600
universe and everything is 42 you still
have to actually run the universe yes

1270
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:09,610
have to actually run the universe yes
 

1271
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:13,300
have to actually run the universe yes
yes like the question I guess or the the

1272
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:13,310
yes like the question I guess or the the
 

1273
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:16,180
yes like the question I guess or the the
you know the the journey is the point

1274
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:16,190
you know the the journey is the point
 

1275
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,820
you know the the journey is the point
right well I think it's saying to

1276
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:18,830
right well I think it's saying to
 

1277
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,650
right well I think it's saying to
summarize this is the result of the

1278
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:20,660
summarize this is the result of the
 

1279
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,670
summarize this is the result of the
universe yeah that's if that is possible

1280
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:23,680
universe yeah that's if that is possible
 

1281
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,530
universe yeah that's if that is possible
it tells us I mean the whole sort of

1282
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:26,540
it tells us I mean the whole sort of
 

1283
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,780
it tells us I mean the whole sort of
structure of thinking about computation

1284
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:28,790
structure of thinking about computation
 

1285
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,790
structure of thinking about computation
and so on and thinking about how stuff

1286
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:30,800
and so on and thinking about how stuff
 

1287
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,760
and so on and thinking about how stuff
works if if there if it's possible to

1288
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:33,770
works if if there if it's possible to
 

1289
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,100
works if if there if it's possible to
say and the answer is such-and-such

1290
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:35,110
say and the answer is such-and-such
 

1291
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,510
say and the answer is such-and-such
you're basically saying there's a way of

1292
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:37,520
you're basically saying there's a way of
 

1293
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,730
you're basically saying there's a way of
going outside the universe and you're

1294
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:39,740
going outside the universe and you're
 

1295
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,140
going outside the universe and you're
kind of you're getting yourself into

1296
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:41,150
kind of you're getting yourself into
 

1297
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:43,120
kind of you're getting yourself into
something of a sort of paradox because

1298
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,130
something of a sort of paradox because
 

1299
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,640
something of a sort of paradox because
you're saying if it's knowable what the

1300
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:45,650
you're saying if it's knowable what the
 

1301
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,980
you're saying if it's knowable what the
answer is then there's a way to know it

1302
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:47,990
answer is then there's a way to know it
 

1303
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,350
answer is then there's a way to know it
that is beyond what the universe

1304
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:50,360
that is beyond what the universe
 

1305
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,750
that is beyond what the universe
provides but if we can know it then

1306
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:52,760
provides but if we can know it then
 

1307
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,640
provides but if we can know it then
something that we're dealing with is

1308
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:54,650
something that we're dealing with is
 

1309
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:57,220
something that we're dealing with is
beyond the universe so then the universe

1310
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:57,230
beyond the universe so then the universe
 

1311
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:01,060
beyond the universe so then the universe
isn't the universe so to speak so and in

1312
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:01,070
isn't the universe so to speak so and in
 

1313
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:04,840
isn't the universe so to speak so and in
general as we'll talk about at least for

1314
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:04,850
general as we'll talk about at least for
 

1315
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:09,130
general as we'll talk about at least for
small human brains it's hard to show

1316
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:09,140
small human brains it's hard to show
 

1317
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,770
small human brains it's hard to show
that the result of a sufficiently

1318
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:11,780
that the result of a sufficiently
 

1319
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,230
that the result of a sufficiently
complex computation it's hard I mean

1320
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:14,240
complex computation it's hard I mean
 

1321
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,660
complex computation it's hard I mean
it's probably impossible right and

1322
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:16,670
it's probably impossible right and
 

1323
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:19,270
it's probably impossible right and
there's a side ability so and the

1324
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:19,280
there's a side ability so and the
 

1325
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,770
there's a side ability so and the
universe appears by at least the poets

1326
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:23,780
universe appears by at least the poets
 

1327
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,200
universe appears by at least the poets
to be sufficiently complex they won't be

1328
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:26,210
to be sufficiently complex they won't be
 

1329
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,720
to be sufficiently complex they won't be
able to predict what the heck it's all

1330
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:28,730
able to predict what the heck it's all
 

1331
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:31,270
able to predict what the heck it's all
going to well we better not be able to

1332
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:31,280
going to well we better not be able to
 

1333
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,870
going to well we better not be able to
because if we can

1334
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:32,880
because if we can
 

1335
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,970
because if we can
kind of denies I mean it's you know

1336
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:34,980
kind of denies I mean it's you know
 

1337
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,100
kind of denies I mean it's you know
we're part of the universe yeah so what

1338
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:37,110
we're part of the universe yeah so what
 

1339
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:39,200
we're part of the universe yeah so what
does it mean for us to predict it means

1340
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,210
does it mean for us to predict it means
 

1341
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,750
does it mean for us to predict it means
that we that our little part of the

1342
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:41,760
that we that our little part of the
 

1343
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,280
that we that our little part of the
universe is able to jump ahead of the

1344
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:43,290
universe is able to jump ahead of the
 

1345
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:45,710
universe is able to jump ahead of the
whole universe and you know this this

1346
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:45,720
whole universe and you know this this
 

1347
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,830
whole universe and you know this this
quickly winds up I mean that there it is

1348
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:48,840
quickly winds up I mean that there it is
 

1349
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,840
quickly winds up I mean that there it is
conceivable the only way we'd be able to

1350
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:50,850
conceivable the only way we'd be able to
 

1351
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,990
conceivable the only way we'd be able to
predict is if we are so special in the

1352
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,000
predict is if we are so special in the
 

1353
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,390
predict is if we are so special in the
universe we are the one place where

1354
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:56,400
universe we are the one place where
 

1355
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,550
universe we are the one place where
there is computation more special more

1356
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:58,560
there is computation more special more
 

1357
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,380
there is computation more special more
sophisticated than anything else that

1358
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:00,390
sophisticated than anything else that
 

1359
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,640
sophisticated than anything else that
exists in the universe that's the only

1360
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:01,650
exists in the universe that's the only
 

1361
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:04,910
exists in the universe that's the only
way we would have the ability to sort of

1362
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:04,920
way we would have the ability to sort of
 

1363
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,070
way we would have the ability to sort of
the almost theological ability so to

1364
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:07,080
the almost theological ability so to
 

1365
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,100
the almost theological ability so to
speak to predict what happens in the

1366
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:10,110
speak to predict what happens in the
 

1367
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,440
speak to predict what happens in the
universe is to say somehow we're we're

1368
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:12,450
universe is to say somehow we're we're
 

1369
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:13,640
universe is to say somehow we're we're
better than everything else in the

1370
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:13,650
better than everything else in the
 

1371
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,000
better than everything else in the
universe which I don't think is the case

1372
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,010
universe which I don't think is the case
 

1373
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:19,490
universe which I don't think is the case
yeah perhaps we can detect a large

1374
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:19,500
yeah perhaps we can detect a large
 

1375
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,570
yeah perhaps we can detect a large
number of looping patterns that reoccur

1376
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:23,580
number of looping patterns that reoccur
 

1377
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,610
number of looping patterns that reoccur
throughout the universe and fully

1378
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:25,620
throughout the universe and fully
 

1379
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,860
throughout the universe and fully
describe them and therefore but then

1380
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:27,870
describe them and therefore but then
 

1381
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,690
describe them and therefore but then
it's it still becomes exceptionally

1382
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:29,700
it's it still becomes exceptionally
 

1383
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,340
it's it still becomes exceptionally
difficult to see how those patterns

1384
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:31,350
difficult to see how those patterns
 

1385
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,220
difficult to see how those patterns
interact and what kind of well look the

1386
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:34,230
interact and what kind of well look the
 

1387
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,930
interact and what kind of well look the
most remarkable thing about the universe

1388
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:35,940
most remarkable thing about the universe
 

1389
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,680
most remarkable thing about the universe
is that it has regularity at all might

1390
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:39,690
is that it has regularity at all might
 

1391
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,840
is that it has regularity at all might
not be the case if you don't have

1392
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:41,850
not be the case if you don't have
 

1393
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:44,000
not be the case if you don't have
regularity absolutely therefore it's

1394
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,010
regularity absolutely therefore it's
 

1395
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,400
regularity absolutely therefore it's
full of I mean physics is successful you

1396
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:46,410
full of I mean physics is successful you
 

1397
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:49,580
full of I mean physics is successful you
know it's full of of laws that tell us a

1398
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:49,590
know it's full of of laws that tell us a
 

1399
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,620
know it's full of of laws that tell us a
lot of detail about how the universe

1400
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:51,630
lot of detail about how the universe
 

1401
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,090
lot of detail about how the universe
works I mean it could be the case that

1402
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:53,100
works I mean it could be the case that
 

1403
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,580
works I mean it could be the case that
you know the 10 to the 90th particles in

1404
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:55,590
you know the 10 to the 90th particles in
 

1405
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,540
you know the 10 to the 90th particles in
the universe they will do their own

1406
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:56,550
the universe they will do their own
 

1407
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,820
the universe they will do their own
thing but they don't they all followed

1408
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:58,830
thing but they don't they all followed
 

1409
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,650
thing but they don't they all followed
we already know they all follow

1410
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:00,660
we already know they all follow
 

1411
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,480
we already know they all follow
basically physical the same physical

1412
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:02,490
basically physical the same physical
 

1413
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:05,390
basically physical the same physical
laws and that's something that's a very

1414
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:05,400
laws and that's something that's a very
 

1415
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,510
laws and that's something that's a very
profound fact about the universe what

1416
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:08,520
profound fact about the universe what
 

1417
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,340
profound fact about the universe what
conclusion you draw from that is unclear

1418
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:10,350
conclusion you draw from that is unclear
 

1419
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,740
conclusion you draw from that is unclear
I mean in the you know the early early

1420
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:12,750
I mean in the you know the early early
 

1421
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,680
I mean in the you know the early early
theologians that was you know exhibit

you know people have different

1426
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:19,860
you know people have different
 

1427
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,930
you know people have different
conclusions about it

1428
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:20,940
conclusions about it
 

1429
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,510
conclusions about it
but the fact is you know right now I

1430
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:23,520
but the fact is you know right now I
 

1431
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,010
but the fact is you know right now I
mean I happen to be interested actually

1432
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:25,020
mean I happen to be interested actually
 

1433
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:28,190
mean I happen to be interested actually
I've just restarted a long-running kind

1434
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:28,200
I've just restarted a long-running kind
 

1435
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,810
I've just restarted a long-running kind
of interest of mine about fundamental

1436
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:29,820
of interest of mine about fundamental

00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:33,140
of interest of mine about fundamental
physics I'm kind of like come on I'm on

1438
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:33,150
physics I'm kind of like come on I'm on
 

1439
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:35,660
physics I'm kind of like come on I'm on
a bit of a quest which I'm about to make

1440
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:35,670
a bit of a quest which I'm about to make
 

1441
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:38,570
a bit of a quest which I'm about to make
more public of to to see if I can

1442
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:38,580
more public of to to see if I can
 

1443
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,070
more public of to to see if I can
actually find the fundamental theory of

1444
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,080
actually find the fundamental theory of
 

1445
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,170
actually find the fundamental theory of
physics excellence we'll come to that

1446
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:42,180
physics excellence we'll come to that
 

1447
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:45,680
physics excellence we'll come to that
and I just had a lot of conversation

1448
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:45,690
and I just had a lot of conversation
 

1449
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:48,560
and I just had a lot of conversation
with quantum mechanics folks with so I'm

1450
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:48,570
with quantum mechanics folks with so I'm
 

1451
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,930
with quantum mechanics folks with so I'm
really excited on your take because I

1452
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:50,940
really excited on your take because I
 

1453
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,050
really excited on your take because I
think you have a fascinating take on the

1454
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:54,060
think you have a fascinating take on the
 

1455
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,900
think you have a fascinating take on the
the the fundamental notch in nature of

1456
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:56,910
the the fundamental notch in nature of
 

1457
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,190
the the fundamental notch in nature of
our reality from a physics perspective

1458
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:58,200
our reality from a physics perspective
 

1459
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,060
our reality from a physics perspective
so and what might be underlying the kind

1460
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:02,070
so and what might be underlying the kind
 

1461
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,970
so and what might be underlying the kind
of physics as we think of it today okay

1462
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:04,980
of physics as we think of it today okay
 

1463
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,340
of physics as we think of it today okay
let's take a step back what is

1464
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:07,350
let's take a step back what is
 

1465
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:10,570
let's take a step back what is
computation it's a good question

1466
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:10,580
computation it's a good question
 

1467
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,250
computation it's a good question
operationally computation is following

1468
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:13,260
operationally computation is following
 

1469
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,130
operationally computation is following
rules that's kind of it

1470
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:16,140
rules that's kind of it
 

1471
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,980
rules that's kind of it
I mean computation is the result is the

1472
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:18,990
I mean computation is the result is the
 

1473
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,780
I mean computation is the result is the
process of systematically following

1474
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:20,790
process of systematically following
 

1475
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:23,870
process of systematically following
rules and it is the thing that happens

1476
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:23,880
rules and it is the thing that happens
 

1477
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,730
rules and it is the thing that happens
when you do that for taking initial

1478
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:25,740
when you do that for taking initial
 

1479
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,530
when you do that for taking initial
conditions are taking inputs and

1480
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:27,540
conditions are taking inputs and
 

1481
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,320
conditions are taking inputs and
following rules I mean what are you

1482
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:30,330
following rules I mean what are you
 

1483
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,630
following rules I mean what are you
following rules on so there has to be

1484
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:32,640
following rules on so there has to be
 

1485
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,660
following rules on so there has to be
some data some not necessarily it can be

1486
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:35,670
some data some not necessarily it can be
 

1487
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,060
some data some not necessarily it can be
something where that there's a you know

1488
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:38,070
something where that there's a you know
 

1489
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,250
something where that there's a you know
very simple input and then you're

1490
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:40,260
very simple input and then you're
 

1491
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,200
very simple input and then you're
following these rules and you'd say

1492
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:42,210
following these rules and you'd say
 

1493
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,910
following these rules and you'd say
there's not really much data going into

1494
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:43,920
there's not really much data going into
 

1495
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,220
there's not really much data going into
this it's you could actually pack the

1496
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:46,230
this it's you could actually pack the
 

1497
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:48,440
this it's you could actually pack the
initial conditions into the rule if you

1498
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:48,450
initial conditions into the rule if you
 

1499
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:51,590
initial conditions into the rule if you
want to um so I think the the question

1500
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:51,600
want to um so I think the the question
 

1501
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,420
want to um so I think the the question
is is there a robust notion of

1502
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:53,430
is is there a robust notion of
 

1503
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,490
is is there a robust notion of
computation that is what is this last

1504
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:55,500
computation that is what is this last
 

1505
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,990
computation that is what is this last
mean what I mean by that is something

1506
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:57,000
mean what I mean by that is something
 

1507
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,370
mean what I mean by that is something
like this so so one of the things that

1508
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:58,380
like this so so one of the things that
 

1509
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,040
like this so so one of the things that
are different in an earlier physics

1510
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,050
are different in an earlier physics
 

1511
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:03,470
are different in an earlier physics
something like energy okay the different

1512
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:03,480
something like energy okay the different
 

1513
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,410
something like energy okay the different
forms of energy there's but somehow

1514
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:06,420
forms of energy there's but somehow
 

1515
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,660
forms of energy there's but somehow
energy is the robust concept that

1516
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:08,670
energy is the robust concept that
 

1517
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:13,040
energy is the robust concept that
doesn't isn't particular to kinetic

1518
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,050
doesn't isn't particular to kinetic
 

1519
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:15,590
doesn't isn't particular to kinetic
energy or you know nuclear energy or

1520
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:15,600
energy or you know nuclear energy or
 

1521
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,120
energy or you know nuclear energy or
whatever else there's a robust idea of

1522
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,130
whatever else there's a robust idea of
 

1523
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,160
whatever else there's a robust idea of
energy so only things you might ask is

1524
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,170
energy so only things you might ask is
 

1525
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:21,680
energy so only things you might ask is
there's the robust idea of computation

1526
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:21,690
there's the robust idea of computation
 

1527
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:24,140
there's the robust idea of computation
or does it matter that this computation

1528
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:24,150
or does it matter that this computation
 

1529
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,700
or does it matter that this computation
is running in a Turing machine this

1530
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:25,710
is running in a Turing machine this
 

1531

running in a fluid system in the whether
those kinds of things or is there a

00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:36,280
those kinds of things or is there a
robust idea of computation that

1540
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:36,290
robust idea of computation that
 

1541
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,660
robust idea of computation that
transcends the sort of detailed

framework that it's running in okay and
is that her yes I mean it wasn't obvious

00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:46,940
is that her yes I mean it wasn't obvious
that there was so it's worth

that there was so it's worth
 

1549
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,500
that there was so it's worth
understanding the history and how we got

1550
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:48,510
understanding the history and how we got
 

1551
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:51,050
understanding the history and how we got
to where we are right now because you

it's not a statement about what is

00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:00,729
it's not a statement about what is
mathematically conceivable it's about

mathematically conceivable it's about
 

1561
00:31:00,739 --> 00:31:03,909
mathematically conceivable it's about
what actually can exist for us maybe you

1562
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:03,919
what actually can exist for us maybe you
 

1563
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,060
what actually can exist for us maybe you
can also comment because energy as a

00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:07,070
can also comment because energy as a
 

1565
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:12,479
can also comment because energy as a
concept is robust but there's also its

00:31:12,479 --> 00:31:12,489
concept is robust but there's also its
 

1567
00:31:12,489 --> 00:31:15,359
concept is robust but there's also its
intricate complicated relationship with

1568
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:15,369
intricate complicated relationship with
 

1569
00:31:15,369 --> 00:31:21,430
intricate complicated relationship with
matter with mass is very interesting of

1570
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:21,440
matter with mass is very interesting of
 

1571
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,509
matter with mass is very interesting of
particles that carry force and particles

1572
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:24,519
particles that carry force and particles
 

1573
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:27,969
particles that carry force and particles
that sort of particles that carry

1574
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:27,979
that sort of particles that carry
 

1575
00:31:27,979 --> 00:31:31,089
that sort of particles that carry
forcing particles that have mass these

1576
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:31,099
forcing particles that have mass these
 

1577
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:33,549
forcing particles that have mass these
kinds of ideas they seem to map to each

1578
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:33,559
kinds of ideas they seem to map to each
 

1579
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,440
kinds of ideas they seem to map to each
other at least in the mathematical sense

1580
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:35,450
other at least in the mathematical sense
 

1581
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:39,129
other at least in the mathematical sense
is there a connection between energy and

1582
00:31:39,129 --> 00:31:39,139
is there a connection between energy and
 

1583
00:31:39,139 --> 00:31:42,039
is there a connection between energy and
mass and computation or are these

1584
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:42,049
mass and computation or are these
 

1585
00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:44,619
mass and computation or are these
completely disjoint ideas we don't know

1586
00:31:44,619 --> 00:31:44,629
completely disjoint ideas we don't know
 

1587
00:31:44,629 --> 00:31:46,570
completely disjoint ideas we don't know
yet the things that I'm trying to do

1588
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:46,580
yet the things that I'm trying to do
 

1589
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:51,369
yet the things that I'm trying to do
about fundamental physics may well lead

1590
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:51,379
about fundamental physics may well lead
 

1591
00:31:51,379 --> 00:31:53,229
about fundamental physics may well lead
to such a connection but there is no

1592
00:31:53,229 --> 00:31:53,239
to such a connection but there is no
 

1593
00:31:53,239 --> 00:31:55,450
to such a connection but there is no
known connection at this time so key can

1594
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:55,460
known connection at this time so key can
 

1595
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,149
known connection at this time so key can
you elaborate a little bit more on what

1596
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:58,159
you elaborate a little bit more on what
 

1597
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,479
you elaborate a little bit more on what
how do you think about computation what

1598
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:01,489
how do you think about computation what
 

1599
00:32:01,489 --> 00:32:03,879
how do you think about computation what
is company yeah so I mean let's let's

1600
00:32:03,879 --> 00:32:03,889
is company yeah so I mean let's let's
 

1601
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:05,289
is company yeah so I mean let's let's
tell a little bit of a historical story

1602
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:05,299
tell a little bit of a historical story
 

1603
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:09,009
tell a little bit of a historical story
yes okay so you know back go back 150

1604
00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:09,019
yes okay so you know back go back 150
 

1605
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:11,849
yes okay so you know back go back 150
years people were making mechanical

1606
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:11,859
years people were making mechanical
 

1607
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:14,529
years people were making mechanical
calculators of various kinds and you

1608
00:32:14,529 --> 00:32:14,539
calculators of various kinds and you
 

1609
00:32:14,539 --> 00:32:15,879
calculators of various kinds and you
know the typical thing was do you want

1610
00:32:15,879 --> 00:32:15,889
know the typical thing was do you want
 

1611
00:32:15,889 --> 00:32:17,289
know the typical thing was do you want
an adding machine you go to the adding

1612
00:32:17,289 --> 00:32:17,299
an adding machine you go to the adding
 

1613
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:19,389
an adding machine you go to the adding
machine store basically he wants a

1614
00:32:19,389 --> 00:32:19,399
machine store basically he wants a
 

1615
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:20,589
machine store basically he wants a
multiplying machine you go to the

1616
00:32:20,589 --> 00:32:20,599
multiplying machine you go to the
 

1617
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:22,210
multiplying machine you go to the
multiplying machine store that different

1618
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:22,220
multiplying machine store that different
 

1619
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,759
multiplying machine store that different
pieces of hardware and so that means

1620
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:24,769
pieces of hardware and so that means
 

1621
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:27,190
pieces of hardware and so that means
that at least at the level of that kind

1622
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:27,200
that at least at the level of that kind
 

1623
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,169
that at least at the level of that kind
of computation and those kinds of pieces

1624
00:32:29,169 --> 00:32:29,179
of computation and those kinds of pieces
 

1625
00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:31,299
of computation and those kinds of pieces
of hardware there isn't a robust notion

1626
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:31,309
of hardware there isn't a robust notion
 

1627
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:31,989
of hardware there isn't a robust notion
of computation

1628
00:32:31,989 --> 00:32:31,999
of computation
 

1629
00:32:31,999 --> 00:32:33,669
of computation
there's the adding machine kind of

1630
00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:33,679
there's the adding machine kind of
 

1631
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:34,869
there's the adding machine kind of
computation there's the multiplying

1632
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:34,879
computation there's the multiplying
 

1633
00:32:34,879 --> 00:32:35,379
computation there's the multiplying
machine

1634
00:32:35,379 --> 00:32:35,389
machine
 

1635
00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:37,450
machine
notion of computation and they're

1636
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:37,460
notion of computation and they're
 

1637
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:41,019
notion of computation and they're
disjoint so what happened in around 1900

1638
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:41,029
disjoint so what happened in around 1900
 

1639
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:42,969
disjoint so what happened in around 1900
people started imagining particularly in

1640
00:32:42,969 --> 00:32:42,979
people started imagining particularly in
 

1641
00:32:42,979 --> 00:32:45,099
people started imagining particularly in
the contests of mathematical logic could

1642
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:45,109
the contests of mathematical logic could
 

1643
00:32:45,109 --> 00:32:47,200
the contests of mathematical logic could
you have something which would be

1644
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:47,210
you have something which would be
 

1645
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:50,349
you have something which would be
represent any reasonable function right

1646
00:32:50,349 --> 00:32:50,359
represent any reasonable function right
 

1647
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:52,029
represent any reasonable function right
and they came up with things this idea

1648
00:32:52,029 --> 00:32:52,039
and they came up with things this idea
 

1649
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:53,379
and they came up with things this idea
of primitive recursion was one of the

1650
00:32:53,379 --> 00:32:53,389
of primitive recursion was one of the
 

1651
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:56,619
of primitive recursion was one of the
early ideas and it didn't work there

1652
00:32:56,619 --> 00:32:56,629
early ideas and it didn't work there
 

1653
00:32:56,629 --> 00:32:58,269
early ideas and it didn't work there
were reasonable functions that people

1654
00:32:58,269 --> 00:32:58,279
were reasonable functions that people
 

1655
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:00,549
were reasonable functions that people
who come up with that were not

1656
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:00,559
who come up with that were not
 

1657
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,830
who come up with that were not
represented using the primitive as a

1658
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:02,840
represented using the primitive as a
 

1659
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,710
represented using the primitive as a
primitive recursion okay so then then

1660
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:05,720
primitive recursion okay so then then
 

1661
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,109
primitive recursion okay so then then
along comes 1931 and girdle's theorem

1662
00:33:08,109 --> 00:33:08,119
along comes 1931 and girdle's theorem
 

1663
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,280
along comes 1931 and girdle's theorem
and so on

1664
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:09,290
and so on
 

1665
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:13,060
and so on
and as in looking back one can see that

1666
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:13,070
and as in looking back one can see that
 

1667
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,950
and as in looking back one can see that
as part of the process of establishing

1668
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:14,960
as part of the process of establishing
 

1669
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,070
as part of the process of establishing
girdles theorem girdle basically showed

1670
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,080
girdles theorem girdle basically showed
 

1671
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,980
girdles theorem girdle basically showed
how you could compile arithmetic you

1672
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:20,990
how you could compile arithmetic you
 

1673
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:24,130
how you could compile arithmetic you
could basically compile logical

1674
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:24,140
could basically compile logical
 

1675
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,450
could basically compile logical
statements like this statement is

1676
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:25,460
statements like this statement is
 

1677
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,150
statements like this statement is
unprovable into arithmetic so what he

1678
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:28,160
unprovable into arithmetic so what he
 

1679
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,920
unprovable into arithmetic so what he
essentially did was to show that

1680
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:29,930
essentially did was to show that
 

1681
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:34,030
essentially did was to show that
arithmetic can be a computer in a sense

1682
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:34,040
arithmetic can be a computer in a sense
 

1683
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,710
arithmetic can be a computer in a sense
that's capable of representing all kinds

1684
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:35,720
that's capable of representing all kinds
 

1685
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,230
that's capable of representing all kinds
of other things and then Turing came

1686
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:38,240
of other things and then Turing came
 

1687
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,500
of other things and then Turing came
along 1936 came up with Turing machines

1688
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:40,510
along 1936 came up with Turing machines
 

1689
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,850
along 1936 came up with Turing machines
meanwhile Alonzo Church had come up with

1690
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:42,860
meanwhile Alonzo Church had come up with
 

1691
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,610
meanwhile Alonzo Church had come up with
lambda calculus and the surprising thing

1692
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:45,620
lambda calculus and the surprising thing
 

1693
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,590
lambda calculus and the surprising thing
that was established very quickly is the

1694
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:47,600
that was established very quickly is the
 

1695
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,240
that was established very quickly is the
Turing machine idea about what might be

1696
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:49,250
Turing machine idea about what might be
 

1697
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,970
Turing machine idea about what might be
what computation might be is exactly the

1698
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:51,980
what computation might be is exactly the
 

1699
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,190
what computation might be is exactly the
same as the lambda calculus idea of what

1700
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:54,200
same as the lambda calculus idea of what
 

1701
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,770
same as the lambda calculus idea of what
computation might be and so and then

1702
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:56,780
computation might be and so and then
 

1703
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,360
computation might be and so and then
there started to be other ideas you know

1704
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:58,370
there started to be other ideas you know
 

1705
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,850
there started to be other ideas you know
register machines other kinds of other

1706
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:00,860
register machines other kinds of other
 

1707
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,620
register machines other kinds of other
kinds of representations of computation

1708
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:02,630
kinds of representations of computation
 

1709
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:05,380
kinds of representations of computation
and the big surprise was they all turned

1710
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:05,390
and the big surprise was they all turned
 

1711
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,360
and the big surprise was they all turned
out to be equivalent so in other words

1712
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:07,370
out to be equivalent so in other words
 

1713
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,010
out to be equivalent so in other words
it might have been the case like those

1714
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:09,020
it might have been the case like those
 

1715
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,360
it might have been the case like those
old adding machines and multiplying

1716
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:10,370
old adding machines and multiplying
 

1717
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:12,400
old adding machines and multiplying
machines that you know Turing had his

1718
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:12,410
machines that you know Turing had his
 

1719
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:14,290
machines that you know Turing had his
idea of computation church had his idea

1720
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:14,300
idea of computation church had his idea
 

1721
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,820
idea of computation church had his idea
of computation and they were just

1722
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:15,830
of computation and they were just
 

1723
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:18,130
of computation and they were just
different but it isn't true there are

00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:18,140
different but it isn't true there are
 

1725
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:21,610
different but it isn't true there are
actually all equivalent so then by I

1726
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:21,620
actually all equivalent so then by I
 

1727
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:26,050
actually all equivalent so then by I
would say the the 1970s or so in in sort

1728
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:26,060
would say the the 1970s or so in in sort
 

1729
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,240
would say the the 1970s or so in in sort

computation theory area people had sort

1732
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:30,410
computation theory area people had sort
 

1733
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:31,900
computation theory area people had sort
of said Oh Turing machines are kind of

1734
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:31,910
of said Oh Turing machines are kind of
 

1735
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:35,260
of said Oh Turing machines are kind of
what computation is physicists were

1736
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:35,270
what computation is physicists were
 

1737
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:37,030

still holding out saying no no no it's

1738
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:37,040
still holding out saying no no no it's
 

1739
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,380
still holding out saying no no no it's
just not how the universe works we've

1740
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:38,390
just not how the universe works we've
 

1741
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:39,940
just not how the universe works we've
got all these differential equations

1742
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:39,950
got all these differential equations
 

1743
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:42,010
got all these differential equations
we've got all these real numbers that

00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:42,020
we've got all these real numbers that
 

1745
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,390
we've got all these real numbers that
have infinite numbers of digits

the universe is now a Turing machine

1748
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:44,810
the universe is now a Turing machine
 

1749
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,380
the universe is now a Turing machine
right the you know the Turing machines

1750
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:47,390
right the you know the Turing machines
 

1751
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:50,770
right the you know the Turing machines
are a small subset of that the things

1752
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:50,780
are a small subset of that the things
 

1753
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,419
are a small subset of that the things
that we make in microprocessors and

1754
00:34:52,419 --> 00:34:52,429
that we make in microprocessors and
 

1755
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:54,610
that we make in microprocessors and
engineering structures and so on so

1756
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:54,620
engineering structures and so on so
 

1757
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,830

probably actually through my work in the

1758
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:56,840
probably actually through my work in the
 

1759
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,550
probably actually through my work in the
1980s about sort of the relationship

1760
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:00,560
1980s about sort of the relationship
 

1761
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,770
1980s about sort of the relationship
between computation and models of

1762
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:02,780
between computation and models of
 

1763
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:05,500
between computation and models of
physics it became a little less clear

1764
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:05,510
physics it became a little less clear
 

1765
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:08,350
physics it became a little less clear
that there would be that there was this

1766
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:08,360
that there would be that there was this
 

1767
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:12,160
that there would be that there was this
big sort of dichotomy between what can

1768
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:12,170
big sort of dichotomy between what can
 

1769
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,930
big sort of dichotomy between what can
happen in physics and what happens and

1770
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:13,940
happen in physics and what happens and
 

1771
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,310
happen in physics and what happens and
things like Turing machines and I think

1772
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:15,320
things like Turing machines and I think
 

1773
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,060
things like Turing machines and I think
probably by now people would mostly

1774
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:19,070
probably by now people would mostly
 

1775
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:21,610
probably by now people would mostly
think and and by the way brains were

1776
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:21,620
think and and by the way brains were
 

1777
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,570
think and and by the way brains were
another kind of elements

1778
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:22,580
another kind of elements
 

1779
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,430
another kind of elements
this I mean you know girdle didn't think

1780
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:24,440
this I mean you know girdle didn't think
 

1781
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,620
this I mean you know girdle didn't think
that his notion of computational what

1782
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:26,630
that his notion of computational what
 

1783
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,210
that his notion of computational what
amounted to his notion of computation

1784
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:28,220
amounted to his notion of computation
 

1785
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:32,050
amounted to his notion of computation
would cover brains and Turing wasn't

1786
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:32,060
would cover brains and Turing wasn't
 

1787
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:32,590
would cover brains and Turing wasn't
sure either

1788
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:32,600
sure either
 

1789
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,050
sure either
um but tell though he was a little bit

1790
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:35,060
um but tell though he was a little bit
 

1791
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:38,170
um but tell though he was a little bit
he got to be a little bit more convinced

1792
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:38,180
he got to be a little bit more convinced
 

1793
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,680
he got to be a little bit more convinced
that it should cover brains um but so

1794
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:41,690
that it should cover brains um but so
 

1795
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:44,140
that it should cover brains um but so
you know but I would say by probably

1796
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:44,150
you know but I would say by probably
 

1797
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,820
you know but I would say by probably
sometime in the 1980s there was

1798
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:45,830
sometime in the 1980s there was
 

1799
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,830
sometime in the 1980s there was
beginning to be so a general belief that

1800
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:47,840
beginning to be so a general belief that
 

1801
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,200
beginning to be so a general belief that
yes this notion of computation that

1802
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:50,210
yes this notion of computation that
 

1803
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:51,670
yes this notion of computation that
could be captured by things like Turing

1804
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:51,680
could be captured by things like Turing
 

1805
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,300
could be captured by things like Turing
machines was reasonably robust now the

1806
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:55,310
machines was reasonably robust now the
 

1807
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:58,470
machines was reasonably robust now the
next question is ok you can have a

1808
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:58,480
next question is ok you can have a
 

1809
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,150
next question is ok you can have a
universal Turing machine that's capable

1810
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:01,160
universal Turing machine that's capable
 

1811
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,120
universal Turing machine that's capable
of being programmed to do anything that

1812
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:04,130
of being programmed to do anything that
 

1813
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:07,510
of being programmed to do anything that
any Turing machine can do um and you

1814
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:07,520
any Turing machine can do um and you
 

1815
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,430
any Turing machine can do um and you
know this idea of universal computation

1816
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:09,440
know this idea of universal computation
 

1817
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,080
know this idea of universal computation
it's an important idea this idea that

1818
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:11,090
it's an important idea this idea that
 

1819
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,940
it's an important idea this idea that
you can have one piece of hardware and

1820
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:12,950
you can have one piece of hardware and
 

1821
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:14,380
you can have one piece of hardware and
program it with different pieces of

1822
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:14,390
program it with different pieces of
 

1823
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:17,110
program it with different pieces of
software you know that's kind of the

1824
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:17,120
software you know that's kind of the
 

1825
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,520
software you know that's kind of the
idea that launched most modern

1826
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:18,530
idea that launched most modern
 

1827
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:19,870
idea that launched most modern
technology I mean that's kind of that

1828
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:19,880
technology I mean that's kind of that
 

1829
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,700
technology I mean that's kind of that
that's the idea that launched computer

1830
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:21,710
that's the idea that launched computer
 

1831
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:24,310
that's the idea that launched computer
revolution software etc so important

1832
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:24,320
revolution software etc so important
 

1833
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,640
revolution software etc so important
idea but but the thing that's still kind

1834
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:27,650
idea but but the thing that's still kind
 

1835
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:29,860
idea but but the thing that's still kind
of holding out from that idea is ok

1836
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:29,870
of holding out from that idea is ok
 

1837
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,630
of holding out from that idea is ok
there is this Universal computation

1838
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:31,640
there is this Universal computation
 

1839
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,560
there is this Universal computation
thing but seems hard to get to it seems

1840
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:35,570
thing but seems hard to get to it seems
 

1841
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:36,880
thing but seems hard to get to it seems
like you want to make a universal

1842
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:36,890
like you want to make a universal
 

1843
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,890
like you want to make a universal
computer you have to kind of have a

1844
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:38,900
computer you have to kind of have a
 

1845
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,750
computer you have to kind of have a
microprocessor with you know a million

1846
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:40,760
microprocessor with you know a million
 

1847
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,970
microprocessor with you know a million
gates in it and you have to go to a lot

1848
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:42,980
gates in it and you have to go to a lot
 

1849
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,620
gates in it and you have to go to a lot
of trouble to make something that

1850
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:44,630
of trouble to make something that
 

1851
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,570
of trouble to make something that
achieves that level of computational

1852
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:46,580
achieves that level of computational
 

1853
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:50,110
achieves that level of computational
sophistication ok so the surprise for me

1854
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:50,120
sophistication ok so the surprise for me
 

1855
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,780
sophistication ok so the surprise for me
was that stuff that I discovered in the

1856
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:52,790
was that stuff that I discovered in the
 

1857
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,540
was that stuff that I discovered in the
early 80s I'm looking at these things

1858
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:55,550
early 80s I'm looking at these things
 

1859
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,460
early 80s I'm looking at these things
called cellular automata which are

1860
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:57,470
called cellular automata which are
 

1861
00:36:57,470 --> 00:37:00,940
called cellular automata which are
really simple computational systems the

1862
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:00,950
really simple computational systems the
 

1863
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,950
really simple computational systems the
thing that was a big surprise to me was

1864
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:02,960
thing that was a big surprise to me was
 

1865
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,930
thing that was a big surprise to me was
that even when their rules were very

1866
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:04,940
that even when their rules were very
 

1867
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:07,060
that even when their rules were very
very simple they were doing things that

1868
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:07,070
very simple they were doing things that
 

1869
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,710
very simple they were doing things that
were as sophisticated as they did even

1870
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:08,720
were as sophisticated as they did even
 

1871
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,240
were as sophisticated as they did even
when their rules much more complicated

1872
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:10,250
when their rules much more complicated
 

1873
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:12,430
when their rules much more complicated
so it didn't look like you know this

1874
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:12,440
so it didn't look like you know this
 

1875
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,800
so it didn't look like you know this
idea Oh to get sophisticated computation

1876
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:14,810
idea Oh to get sophisticated computation
 

1877
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:16,840
idea Oh to get sophisticated computation
you have to build something with very

1878
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:16,850
you have to build something with very
 

1879
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:17,920
you have to build something with very
sophisticated rules

1880
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:17,930
sophisticated rules
 

1881
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:21,850
sophisticated rules
that idea didn't seem to pan out and

1882
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:21,860
that idea didn't seem to pan out and
 

1883
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,710
that idea didn't seem to pan out and
instead it seemed to be the case that

1884
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:23,720
instead it seemed to be the case that
 

1885
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,540
instead it seemed to be the case that
sophisticated computation was completely

1886
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:25,550
sophisticated computation was completely
 

1887
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,490
sophisticated computation was completely
ubiquitous even in systems with

1888
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:27,500
ubiquitous even in systems with
 

1889
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,430
ubiquitous even in systems with
incredibly simple rules and so that led

1890
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:30,440
incredibly simple rules and so that led
 

1891
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,170
incredibly simple rules and so that led
to this thing that I call the principle

1892
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:32,180
to this thing that I call the principle
 

1893
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,060
to this thing that I call the principle
of computational equivalence which

1894
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:34,070
of computational equivalence which
 

1895
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:36,780
of computational equivalence which
basically says when you have a system

1896
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:36,790
basically says when you have a system
 

1897
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:40,640
basically says when you have a system
that follows rules of any kind then

1898
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:40,650
that follows rules of any kind then
 

1899
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:43,380
that follows rules of any kind then
whenever the system isn't doing things

1900
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:43,390
whenever the system isn't doing things
 

1901
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:45,830
whenever the system isn't doing things
that are in some sense obviously simple

1902
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:45,840
that are in some sense obviously simple
 

1903
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,800
that are in some sense obviously simple
then the computation that the behavior

1904
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:49,810
then the computation that the behavior
 

1905
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,600
then the computation that the behavior
of the system corresponds to is of

1906
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:51,610
of the system corresponds to is of
 

1907
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:54,120
of the system corresponds to is of
equivalent sophistication so that means

1908
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:54,130
equivalent sophistication so that means
 

1909
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,490
equivalent sophistication so that means
that when you kind of go from the very

1910
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:56,500
that when you kind of go from the very
 

1911
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,780
that when you kind of go from the very
very very simplest things you can

1912
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:57,790
very very simplest things you can
 

1913
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:00,570
very very simplest things you can
imagine then quite quickly you hit this

1914
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:00,580
imagine then quite quickly you hit this
 

1915
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,180
imagine then quite quickly you hit this
kind of threshold above which everything

1916
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:03,190
kind of threshold above which everything
 

1917
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,530
kind of threshold above which everything
is equivalent in its computational

1918
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:04,540
is equivalent in its computational
 

1919
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,720
is equivalent in its computational
sophistication not obvious that would be

1920
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:06,730
sophistication not obvious that would be
 

1921
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:09,240
sophistication not obvious that would be
the case I mean that's a science fact

1922
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:09,250
the case I mean that's a science fact
 

1923
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,820

well then hold on a second

such complexity and yes there's an
 

1935
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:25,170
such complexity and yes there's an

2039
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,010
doesn't depend on the details of each
individual system and that's why we can

00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:42,020
individual system and that's why we can
 

2041
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,350
individual system and that's why we can
meaningfully talk about a thing called

meaningfully talk about a thing called
 

2043

meaningfully talk about a thing called
computation and we're not stuck talking

about over there's computation in

about over there's computation in

2049
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,980

etc etc that's that's why there is a

2050
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:53,990
etc etc that's that's why there is a
 

2051
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:56,320
etc etc that's that's why there is a
robust notion like that now on the other

prove it as a mathematical result well
 

2059
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,840
prove it as a mathematical result well
the answer is actually we've got some

the answer is actually we've got some
 

2061
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:06,940
the answer is actually we've got some
nice results along those lines that say

00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:15,190
very simple rules well in a couple of

2069
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,020

2073
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:22,930

of follow what you would expect from the

2074
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:22,940
of follow what you would expect from the
 

2075
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,190
of follow what you would expect from the

so that's a nice piece of sort of

2078
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:25,340
so that's a nice piece of sort of
 

2079
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,550
so that's a nice piece of sort of

2194
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:39,200
the point where we actually have this is
 

2195
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,109
the point where we actually have this is
the fundamental theory of physics here

2196
00:43:41,109 --> 00:43:41,119
the fundamental theory of physics here
 

2197
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,390
the fundamental theory of physics here
it is it's this program run this program

2198
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:43,400
it is it's this program run this program
 

2199
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,480
it is it's this program run this program
and you will get our universe then we've

2200
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:46,490
and you will get our universe then we've
 

2201
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,819
and you will get our universe then we've
kind of reduced the problem of figuring

2202
00:43:48,819 --> 00:43:48,829
kind of reduced the problem of figuring
 

2203
00:43:48,829 --> 00:43:50,950
kind of reduced the problem of figuring
out things in physics to a problem of

2204
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:50,960
out things in physics to a problem of
 

2205
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,930
out things in physics to a problem of
doing some what turns out to be very

2206
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:52,940
doing some what turns out to be very
 

2207
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:55,270
doing some what turns out to be very
difficult irreducibly difficult

2208
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:55,280
difficult irreducibly difficult
 

2209
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,730
difficult irreducibly difficult
mathematical problems but it no longer

2210
00:43:57,730 --> 00:43:57,740
mathematical problems but it no longer
 

2211
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,410
mathematical problems but it no longer
is the case that we can say that

2212
00:43:59,410 --> 00:43:59,420
is the case that we can say that
 

2213
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,540
is the case that we can say that
somebody can come in and say whoops you

2214
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:01,550
somebody can come in and say whoops you
 

2215
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:02,650
somebody can come in and say whoops you
know you were right about all these

2216
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:02,660
know you were right about all these
 

2217
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,690
know you were right about all these
things about Turing machines but you're

2218
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:04,700
things about Turing machines but you're
 

2219
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,040
things about Turing machines but you're
wrong about the physical universe we

2220
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:06,050
wrong about the physical universe we
 

2221
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:08,200
wrong about the physical universe we
know there's sort of ground truth about

2222
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:08,210
know there's sort of ground truth about
 

2223
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:09,280
know there's sort of ground truth about
what's happening the physical universe

2224
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:09,290
what's happening the physical universe
 

2225
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:12,400
what's happening the physical universe
now I happen to think I mean you asked

2226
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:12,410
now I happen to think I mean you asked
 

2227
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:13,960
now I happen to think I mean you asked
me at an interesting time because I'm

2228
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:13,970
me at an interesting time because I'm
 

2229
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:16,540
me at an interesting time because I'm
just in the middle of starting to

2230
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:16,550
just in the middle of starting to
 

2231
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:20,060
just in the middle of starting to
re-energized my my project to kind of

2232
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:20,070
re-energized my my project to kind of
 

2233
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:21,820
re-energized my my project to kind of
study the fundamental theory of physics

2234
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:21,830
study the fundamental theory of physics
 

2235
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:25,790
study the fundamental theory of physics
as of today I'm very optimistic that

2236
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:25,800
as of today I'm very optimistic that
 

2237
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,080
as of today I'm very optimistic that
we're actually going to find something

2238
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:27,090
we're actually going to find something
 

2239
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:29,480
we're actually going to find something
and that it's going to be possible to to

2240
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:29,490
and that it's going to be possible to to
 

2241
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:30,620
and that it's going to be possible to to
see that the universe really is

2242
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:30,630
see that the universe really is
 

2243
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:32,840
see that the universe really is
computational in that sense but I don't

2244
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:32,850
computational in that sense but I don't
 

2245
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:35,030
computational in that sense but I don't
know because we're betting against you

2246
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:35,040
know because we're betting against you
 

2247
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,100
know because we're betting against you
know we're betting against the universe

know we're betting against the universe
 

2249
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:39,110
know we're betting against the universe
sort of speaking I didn't you know it's

2250
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:39,120
sort of speaking I didn't you know it's
 

2251
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,030
sort of speaking I didn't you know it's
not like you know when I spend a lot of

00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:41,040
not like you know when I spend a lot of
 

2253
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,370
not like you know when I spend a lot of
my life building technology and then I

2254
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:43,380
my life building technology and then I
 

2255
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,410
my life building technology and then I
know what what's in there right and it's

00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:45,420
know what what's in there right and it's

behavior may have bugs things like that
 

2261
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,030
behavior may have bugs things like that
but fundamentally I know what's in there

2262
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:50,040
but fundamentally I know what's in there
 

2263
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,280
but fundamentally I know what's in there
for the universe I'm not in that

the fundamental laws of physics might
 

2271
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,470
the fundamental laws of physics might
emerge from so just to clarify so

there's you've you've done a lot of

there's you've you've done a lot of

there's you've you've done a lot of
fascinating work with kind of discrete

kinds of computation that you know use
 

2279
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:13,670
kinds of computation that you know use
cellular automata and we'll talk about

2280
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:13,680
cellular automata and we'll talk about
 

2281
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,270

00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:17,280
it have this very clean structure it's
 

2283
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,710
it have this very clean structure it's
such a nice way to demonstrate that

2284
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:18,720
such a nice way to demonstrate that
 

2285
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,320
such a nice way to demonstrate that
simple rules can create immense

2286

simple rules can create immense
 

2287
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:26,900
simple rules can create immense
complexity but what you know is that

2288
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:26,910
complexity but what you know is that
 

2289
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:28,460
complexity but what you know is that
actually our cellular time is

00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:28,470
actually our cellular time is

well so so this is a slightly

2302
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:41,790
well so so this is a slightly
 

2303
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:44,000
well so so this is a slightly
complicated issue because as soon as you

2304
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:44,010
complicated issue because as soon as you
 

2305
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:46,070
complicated issue because as soon as you
have universal computation you can in

2306
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:46,080
have universal computation you can in
 

2307
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,510
have universal computation you can in
principle simulate anything with

00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,240
principle simulate anything with
anything but it is not a natural thing

anything but it is not a natural thing
 

2311
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:53,150
anything but it is not a natural thing
to do and if you're asking will you to

00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:53,160
to do and if you're asking will you to
 

2313
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,760
to do and if you're asking will you to

00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:55,770
try to find our physical universe by

try to find our physical universe by

I've been interested in for a long time
is what are the most structureless

00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:19,680
is what are the most structureless

00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,440
is what are the most structureless
structures that we can create with

2350
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:31,980
every cell is updated in synchrony at
 

2351
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:33,620
every cell is updated in synchrony at
the sir at a particular you know when

2352
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:33,630
the sir at a particular you know when
 

2353
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:35,780
the sir at a particular you know when
there's a there's a click of a clock

2354
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:35,790
there's a there's a click of a clock
 

2355
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:37,730
there's a there's a click of a clock
sort of speaking it goes a tick of a

2356
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:37,740
sort of speaking it goes a tick of a
 

2357
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,830
sort of speaking it goes a tick of a
clock and that every cell gets updated

2358
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:39,840
clock and that every cell gets updated
 

2359
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,200
clock and that every cell gets updated
at the same time that's a very specific

2360
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:42,210
at the same time that's a very specific
 

2361
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:45,500
at the same time that's a very specific
very rigid kind of thing but my guess is

2362
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:45,510
very rigid kind of thing but my guess is
 

2363
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:48,320
very rigid kind of thing but my guess is
that when we look at physics and we look

2364
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:48,330
that when we look at physics and we look
 

2365
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:50,240
that when we look at physics and we look
at things like space and time that

2366
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:50,250
at things like space and time that
 

2367
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:52,190
at things like space and time that
what's underneath space and time is

2368
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:52,200
what's underneath space and time is
 

2369
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,590
what's underneath space and time is
something as structureless as possible

2370
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:54,600
something as structureless as possible
 

2371
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,640
something as structureless as possible
that what we see what emerges for us as

2372
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:57,650
that what we see what emerges for us as
 

2373
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:00,650
that what we see what emerges for us as
physical space for example comes from

2374
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:00,660
physical space for example comes from
 

2375
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,650
physical space for example comes from
something that is sort of arbitrarily

2376
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:02,660
something that is sort of arbitrarily
 

2377
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:05,540
something that is sort of arbitrarily
unstructured underneath and so I've been

2378
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:05,550
unstructured underneath and so I've been
 

2379
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:07,790
unstructured underneath and so I've been
for a long time interested in kind of

2380
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:07,800
for a long time interested in kind of
 

2381
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,590
for a long time interested in kind of
what what are the most structureless

2382
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:09,600
what what are the most structureless
 

2383
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,650
what what are the most structureless
structures that we can set up and

2384
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:11,660
structures that we can set up and
 

2385
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:14,450
structures that we can set up and
actually what I had thought about for

2386
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:14,460
actually what I had thought about for
 

2387
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,720
actually what I had thought about for
ages is using graphs networks where

2388
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:17,730
ages is using graphs networks where
 

2389
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:19,700
ages is using graphs networks where
essentially so they'll throw that space

2390
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:19,710
essentially so they'll throw that space
 

2391
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:23,599
essentially so they'll throw that space
for example so what is space the kind of

2392
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:23,609
for example so what is space the kind of
 

2393
00:47:23,609 --> 00:47:25,820
for example so what is space the kind of
a question one might ask back in the

2394
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:25,830
a question one might ask back in the
 

2395
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:27,170
a question one might ask back in the
early days of quantum mechanics for

2396
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:27,180
early days of quantum mechanics for
 

2397
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:30,140
early days of quantum mechanics for
example people said oh for sure space is

2398
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:30,150
example people said oh for sure space is
 

2399
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:31,370
example people said oh for sure space is
going to be discrete because all these

2400
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:31,380
going to be discrete because all these
 

2401
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:32,930
going to be discrete because all these
other things were finding a discrete but

2402
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:32,940
other things were finding a discrete but
 

2403
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:35,120
other things were finding a discrete but
that never worked out in physics and so

2404
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:35,130
that never worked out in physics and so
 

2405
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:36,980
that never worked out in physics and so
space and physics today is always

2406
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:36,990
space and physics today is always
 

2407
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:39,349
space and physics today is always
treated as this continuous thing just

2408
00:47:39,349 --> 00:47:39,359
treated as this continuous thing just
 

2409
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,330
treated as this continuous thing just
like Euclid imagined it I mean the the

2410
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:41,340
like Euclid imagined it I mean the the
 

2411
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:43,280
like Euclid imagined it I mean the the
very first thing you chlid says and his

2412
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:43,290
very first thing you chlid says and his
 

2413
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:45,590
very first thing you chlid says and his
sort of common notions is you know a

2414
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:45,600
sort of common notions is you know a
 

2415
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,780
sort of common notions is you know a
point is something which has no part in

2416
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:47,790
point is something which has no part in
 

2417
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:49,490
point is something which has no part in
other words there are there are points

2418
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:49,500
other words there are there are points
 

2419
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,740
other words there are there are points
that are arbitrarily small and there's a

2420
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:51,750
that are arbitrarily small and there's a
 

2421
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:53,780
that are arbitrarily small and there's a
continuum of possible positions of

2422
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:53,790
continuum of possible positions of
 

2423
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:56,330
continuum of possible positions of
points and the question is is that true

2424
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:56,340
points and the question is is that true
 

2425
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,340
points and the question is is that true
and so for example if we look at I don't

2426
00:47:58,340 --> 00:47:58,350
and so for example if we look at I don't
 

2427
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:00,800
and so for example if we look at I don't
know fluid like air or water we might

2428
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:00,810
know fluid like air or water we might
 

2429
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:02,480
know fluid like air or water we might
say oh it's a continuous fluid we can

2430
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:02,490
say oh it's a continuous fluid we can
 

2431
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:04,099
say oh it's a continuous fluid we can
pour it we can do all kinds of things

2432
00:48:04,099 --> 00:48:04,109
pour it we can do all kinds of things
 

2433
00:48:04,109 --> 00:48:06,170
pour it we can do all kinds of things
continuously but actually we know

2434
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:06,180
continuously but actually we know
 

2435
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,790
continuously but actually we know
because we know the physics of it that

2436
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:07,800
because we know the physics of it that
 

2437
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:08,990
because we know the physics of it that
it consists of a bunch of discrete

2438
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:09,000
it consists of a bunch of discrete
 

2439
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,640
it consists of a bunch of discrete
molecules bouncing around and only in

2440
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:10,650
molecules bouncing around and only in
 

2441
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:13,280
molecules bouncing around and only in
the aggregate is it behaving like a

2442
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:13,290
the aggregate is it behaving like a
 

2443
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:16,070
the aggregate is it behaving like a
continuum and so the possibility exists

2444
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:16,080
continuum and so the possibility exists
 

2445
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,840
continuum and so the possibility exists
that that's true of space too people

2446
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:17,850
that that's true of space too people
 

2447
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:19,520
that that's true of space too people
haven't managed to make that work with

2448
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:19,530
haven't managed to make that work with
 

2449
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:22,849
haven't managed to make that work with
existing frameworks and physics but I've

2450
00:48:22,849 --> 00:48:22,859
existing frameworks and physics but I've
 

2451
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:24,890
existing frameworks and physics but I've
been interested in whether one can

2452
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:24,900
been interested in whether one can
 

2453
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:27,410
been interested in whether one can
imagine that underneath space and also

2454
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:27,420
imagine that underneath space and also
 

2455
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,450
imagine that underneath space and also
underneath time is something more

2456
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:29,460
underneath time is something more
 

2457
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:32,120
underneath time is something more
structureless and the question is is it

2458
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:32,130
structureless and the question is is it
 

2459
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:34,640
structureless and the question is is it
computational so there are couple

2460
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:34,650
computational so there are couple
 

2461
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:36,859
computational so there are couple
possibilities it could be computational

2462
00:48:36,859 --> 00:48:36,869
possibilities it could be computational
 

2463
00:48:36,869 --> 00:48:38,300
possibilities it could be computational
somehow fundamentally equivalent to a

2464
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:38,310
somehow fundamentally equivalent to a
 

2465
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:40,180
somehow fundamentally equivalent to a
Turing machine or it could be

2466
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:40,190
Turing machine or it could be
 

2467
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:42,170
Turing machine or it could be
fundamentally not so how could it not be

2468
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:42,180
fundamentally not so how could it not be
 

2469
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:44,000
fundamentally not so how could it not be
it could not be so

2470
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:44,010
it could not be so
 

2471
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:45,950
it could not be so
machine essentially deals with integers

2472
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:45,960
machine essentially deals with integers

yes it has an infinite storage the

yes it has an infinite storage the

yes it has an infinite storage the

storage but what temp when one thinks

00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,860
storage but what temp when one thinks
about doing physics or sort of idealized

about doing physics or sort of idealized

about doing physics or sort of idealized
physics or idealized mathematics one can

are absolutely precise someone can say

are absolutely precise someone can say

00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:14,900
are absolutely precise someone can say
we can take this number and we can

we can take this number and we can

00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,550
we can take this number and we can
multiply it by itself are you

2498
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:16,560
multiply it by itself are you

multiply it by itself are you
comfortable with infinity in this

comfortable with infinity in this

infinity and plays a part I think that

00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,620
the thing that might underlie the laws
of physics I think that um no I think

one yeah I mean this human has a hard

2662
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:13,450
one yeah I mean this human has a hard
 

2663
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:15,480
one yeah I mean this human has a hard
time understanding it you know a bunch

2664
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:15,490
time understanding it you know a bunch
 

2665
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:16,859
time understanding it you know a bunch
of the things that are going on but but

2666
00:52:16,859 --> 00:52:16,869
of the things that are going on but but
 

2667
00:52:16,869 --> 00:52:19,080
of the things that are going on but but
what happens in understanding is one

2668
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:19,090
what happens in understanding is one
 

2669
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:20,840
what happens in understanding is one
builds waypoints I mean if you said

2670
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:20,850
builds waypoints I mean if you said
 

2671
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:23,070
builds waypoints I mean if you said
understand modern 21st century

2672
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:23,080
understand modern 21st century
 

2673
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:26,550
understand modern 21st century
mathematics starting from you know

2674
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:26,560
mathematics starting from you know
 

2675
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,010

counting back in you know whenever

2676
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:29,020
counting back in you know whenever
 

2677
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,810
counting back in you know whenever
counting was invented 50,000 years ago

2678
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:30,820
counting was invented 50,000 years ago
 

2679
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:33,300
counting was invented 50,000 years ago
whenever it was right there's that will

2680
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:33,310
whenever it was right there's that will
 

2681
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:35,310
whenever it was right there's that will
be really difficult but what happens is

2682
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:35,320
be really difficult but what happens is
 

2683
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,620
be really difficult but what happens is
we build waypoints that allow us to get

2684
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:37,630
we build waypoints that allow us to get
 

2685
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:39,570
we build waypoints that allow us to get
to higher levels of understanding and we

2686
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:39,580
to higher levels of understanding and we
 

2687
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,040
to higher levels of understanding and we
see the same thing happening in language

2688
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:41,050
see the same thing happening in language
 

2689
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:43,170
see the same thing happening in language
you know when we invent a word for

2690
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:43,180
you know when we invent a word for
 

2691
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:44,880
you know when we invent a word for
something it provides kind of a

2692
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:44,890
something it provides kind of a
 

2693
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:47,340
something it provides kind of a
cognitive anchor a kind of a waypoints

2694
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:47,350
cognitive anchor a kind of a waypoints
 

2695
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:49,890
cognitive anchor a kind of a waypoints
that lets us you know like a podcast or

2696
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:49,900
that lets us you know like a podcast or
 

2697
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,960
that lets us you know like a podcast or
something you could be explaining well

2698
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:51,970
something you could be explaining well
 

2699
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:53,910
something you could be explaining well
it's a thing which this works this way

2700
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:53,920
it's a thing which this works this way
 

2701
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,650
it's a thing which this works this way
that way the other way but as soon as

2702
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:55,660
that way the other way but as soon as
 

2703
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:58,349
that way the other way but as soon as
you have the word podcast and people

2704
00:52:58,349 --> 00:52:58,359
you have the word podcast and people
 

2705
00:52:58,359 --> 00:53:00,540
you have the word podcast and people
kind of societally understand it you

2706
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:00,550
kind of societally understand it you
 

2707
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:01,980
kind of societally understand it you
start to be able to build on top of that

2708
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:01,990
start to be able to build on top of that
 

2709
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:04,080
start to be able to build on top of that
and so I think and that that's kind of

2710
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:04,090
and so I think and that that's kind of
 

2711
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:06,000
and so I think and that that's kind of
the story of science actually - I mean

2712
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:06,010
the story of science actually - I mean
 

2713
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:07,680
the story of science actually - I mean
science is about building these kind of

2714
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:07,690
science is about building these kind of
 

2715
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:09,960
science is about building these kind of
waypoints where we find this sort of

2716
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:09,970
waypoints where we find this sort of
 

2717
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:11,460
waypoints where we find this sort of
cognitive

2718
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:11,470
cognitive
 

2719
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:13,230
cognitive
mechanism for understanding something

2720
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:13,240
mechanism for understanding something
 

2721
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,700
mechanism for understanding something
then we can build on top of it you know

2722
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:14,710
then we can build on top of it you know
 

2723
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:16,770
then we can build on top of it you know
we we have the idea of I don't know

2724
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:16,780
we we have the idea of I don't know
 

2725
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,330
we we have the idea of I don't know
differential equations we can build on

2726
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:18,340
differential equations we can build on
 

2727
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:20,400
differential equations we can build on
top of that we have this idea of that

2728
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:20,410
top of that we have this idea of that
 

2729
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:23,970
top of that we have this idea of that
idea so my hope is that if it is the

2730
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:23,980
idea so my hope is that if it is the
 

2731
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:26,310
idea so my hope is that if it is the
case that we have to go all the way sort

2732
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:26,320
case that we have to go all the way sort
 

2733
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,590
case that we have to go all the way sort
of from the sand to the computer and

2734
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:28,600
of from the sand to the computer and
 

2735
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,140
of from the sand to the computer and
there's no way points in between then

2736
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:31,150
there's no way points in between then
 

2737
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:33,720
there's no way points in between then
we're toast we won't be able to do that

2738
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:33,730
we're toast we won't be able to do that
 

2739
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:36,560
we're toast we won't be able to do that
well eventually we might so for if we're

2740
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:36,570
well eventually we might so for if we're
 

2741
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:38,790
well eventually we might so for if we're
as clever apes are good enough a

2742
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:38,800
as clever apes are good enough a

building those abstract abstractions

2744
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:40,510
building those abstract abstractions
 

2745
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:42,060
building those abstract abstractions
eventually from sanh we'll get to the

00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:42,070
eventually from sanh we'll get to the
 

2747
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:44,400
eventually from sanh we'll get to the
computer a and it just might be a longer

2748
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:44,410
computer a and it just might be a longer
 

2749
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:46,050

journey the question is whether it is

2750
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:46,060
journey the question is whether it is
 

2751
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:47,670
journey the question is whether it is
something that you asked whether our

2752
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:47,680
something that you asked whether our
 

2753
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,500
something that you asked whether our
human brains yes

2754
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:49,510
human brains yes
 

2755
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:51,330
human brains yes
well on will quotes understand what's

2756
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:51,340
well on will quotes understand what's
 

2757
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:53,160
well on will quotes understand what's
going on and that's a different question

2758
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:53,170
going on and that's a different question
 

2759
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:56,700
going on and that's a different question
because for that it requires steps that

2760
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:56,710
because for that it requires steps that
 

2761
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:59,190
because for that it requires steps that
are for whether it is sort of from which

2762
00:53:59,190 --> 00:53:59,200
are for whether it is sort of from which
 

2763
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,380
are for whether it is sort of from which
we can construct a human understandable

2764
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:01,390
we can construct a human understandable
 

2765
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:03,630
we can construct a human understandable
narrative and that's something that I

2766
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:03,640
narrative and that's something that I
 

2767
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,020
narrative and that's something that I
think I am somewhat hopeful that that

2768
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:07,030
think I am somewhat hopeful that that
 

2769
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:09,720
think I am somewhat hopeful that that
will be possible although you know as of

2770
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:09,730
will be possible although you know as of
 

2771
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:11,960
will be possible although you know as of
literally today if you ask me I'm

2772
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:11,970
literally today if you ask me I'm
 

2773
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:13,470
literally today if you ask me I'm
confronted with things that I don't

2774
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:13,480
confronted with things that I don't
 

2775
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:17,040
confronted with things that I don't
understand very well um and so this is a

2776
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:17,050
understand very well um and so this is a
 

2777
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:19,290
understand very well um and so this is a
small pattern in a computation trying to

2778
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:19,300
small pattern in a computation trying to
 

2779
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,420
small pattern in a computation trying to
understand the rules under which the

2780
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:21,430
understand the rules under which the
 

2781
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:24,300
understand the rules under which the
computation functions and yeah it's it's

2782
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:24,310
computation functions and yeah it's it's
 

2783
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:26,940
computation functions and yeah it's it's
an interesting possibility under which

2784
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:26,950
an interesting possibility under which
 

2785
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:29,370
an interesting possibility under which
kinds of computations such a creature

2786
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:29,380
kinds of computations such a creature
 

2787
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:32,670
kinds of computations such a creature
can understand itself my guess is that

2788
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:32,680
can understand itself my guess is that
 

2789
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,710
can understand itself my guess is that
within so we didn't talk much about

2790
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:34,720
within so we didn't talk much about
 

2791
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,690
within so we didn't talk much about
computational irreducibility but it's a

2792
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:36,700
computational irreducibility but it's a
 

2793
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,950
computational irreducibility but it's a
consequence of this principle of

2794
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:37,960
consequence of this principle of
 

2795
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:39,870
consequence of this principle of
computational equivalence and it's sort

2796
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:39,880
computational equivalence and it's sort
 

2797
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,550
computational equivalence and it's sort
of a core idea that that one has to

00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:41,560
of a core idea that that one has to

00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,680
of a core idea that that one has to
understand I think which is question is

2800
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:43,690
understand I think which is question is
 

2801
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:46,110
understand I think which is question is
you're doing a computation you can

2802
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:46,120
you're doing a computation you can
 

2803
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,310
you're doing a computation you can
figure out what happens in the

2804
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:47,320
figure out what happens in the
 

2805
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,110
figure out what happens in the
computation just by running every step

2806
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:49,120
computation just by running every step
 

2807
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,310
computation just by running every step
in the computation and seeing what

2808
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:50,320
in the computation and seeing what
 

2809
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,550
in the computation and seeing what
happens or you can say let me jump ahead

2810
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:53,560
happens or you can say let me jump ahead
 

2811
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:56,250
happens or you can say let me jump ahead
and figure out you know have something

2812
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:56,260
and figure out you know have something
 

2813
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:58,020
and figure out you know have something
smarter that figures out what's gonna

2814
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:58,030
smarter that figures out what's gonna
 

2815
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:00,240
smarter that figures out what's gonna
happen before it actually happens and a

happen before it actually happens and a
lot of traditional science has been

2818
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:02,800
lot of traditional science has been
 

2819
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,160
lot of traditional science has been
about that act of computational reduce

2820
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:05,170
about that act of computational reduce
 

2821
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:07,980
about that act of computational reduce
ability it's like we've got these

2822
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:07,990
ability it's like we've got these
 

2823
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:09,990
ability it's like we've got these
equations and we can just solve them or

2824
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:10,000
equations and we can just solve them or
 

2825
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,160
equations and we can just solve them or
we can figure out what's going to happen

2826
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:11,170
we can figure out what's going to happen
 

2827
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:13,020
we can figure out what's going to happen
we don't have to trace all of those

2828
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:13,030
we don't have to trace all of those
 

2829
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:14,610
we don't have to trace all of those
steps we just jump ahead because we've

2830
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:14,620
steps we just jump ahead because we've
 

2831
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:17,160
steps we just jump ahead because we've
solved these equations okay so one of

2832
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:17,170
solved these equations okay so one of
 

2833
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:18,630
solved these equations okay so one of
the things that is a consequence of the

00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:18,640
the things that is a consequence of the
 

2835
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,010
the things that is a consequence of the
principle of computational equivalence

2836

principle of computational equivalence
 

2837
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:22,230
principle of computational equivalence
is you don't always get to do that many

2838
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:22,240
is you don't always get to do that many
 

2839
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,750
is you don't always get to do that many
many systems will be computationally

2840
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:23,760
many systems will be computationally

right that's not going to be correct

right that's not going to be correct
 

2867
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:51,599
right that's not going to be correct
because it means that there's us during

because it means that there's us during

computations are fundamentally
 

2879
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:02,940
computations are fundamentally
equivalent so that means we don't get to

00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:02,950
equivalent so that means we don't get to
 

2881

equivalent so that means we don't get to
say we're a lot smarter than the

because we're just doing computation

because we're just doing computation

00:56:07,869 --> 00:56:09,930
because we're just doing computation
that's of the same sophistication as the

that's of the same sophistication as the

2935
00:56:58,329 --> 00:57:00,510

pockets of computational reducibility

2938

feature of computational irreducibility
 

2947
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:14,160
feature of computational irreducibility
it's sort of a mathematical feature that

00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:14,170
it's sort of a mathematical feature that
 

2949
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:15,480
it's sort of a mathematical feature that
there are always an infinite collection

there are always an infinite collection

00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:17,940
there are always an infinite collection
of pockets of reduced ability the

of pockets of reduced ability the
 

2953
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:19,140
of pockets of reduced ability the
question of whether they land in the

2954
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:19,150
question of whether they land in the
 

2955
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:20,430
question of whether they land in the
right place and whether we can sort of

00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:20,440
right place and whether we can sort of
 

2957
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,230
right place and whether we can sort of
build the theory based on them is

build the theory based on them is
 

2959
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,809
build the theory based on them is
unclear but to this point about you know

unclear but to this point about you know
 

2961
00:57:24,819 --> 00:57:27,180
unclear but to this point about you know
whether we as observers in the universe

2973
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:40,990
reducibility it's won't work
work but I think this question about how

2974
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:41,000
work but I think this question about how
 

2975
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,020
work but I think this question about how
observers operate it's one of the

2976
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:44,030
observers operate it's one of the
 

2977
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:45,549
observers operate it's one of the
features of science over the last

2978
00:57:45,549 --> 00:57:45,559
features of science over the last
 

2979
00:57:45,559 --> 00:57:48,220
features of science over the last
hundred years particularly has been that

2980
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:48,230
hundred years particularly has been that
 

2981
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:49,839
hundred years particularly has been that
every time we get more realistic about

2982
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:49,849
every time we get more realistic about
 

2983
00:57:49,849 --> 00:57:51,880
every time we get more realistic about
observers we learn a bit more about

2984
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:51,890
observers we learn a bit more about
 

2985
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:54,880
observers we learn a bit more about
science so for example relativity was

2986
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:54,890
science so for example relativity was
 

2987
00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:57,280
science so for example relativity was
all about observers don't get to say

2988
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:57,290
all about observers don't get to say
 

2989
00:57:57,290 --> 00:58:00,160
all about observers don't get to say
when you know what's simultaneous with

2990
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:00,170
when you know what's simultaneous with
 

2991
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:01,539
when you know what's simultaneous with
what they have to just wait for the

2992
00:58:01,539 --> 00:58:01,549
what they have to just wait for the
 

2993
00:58:01,549 --> 00:58:03,460
what they have to just wait for the
light signal to arrive to decide what

2994
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:03,470
light signal to arrive to decide what
 

2995
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:05,829
light signal to arrive to decide what
simultaneous or for example in

simultaneous or for example in
thermodynamics observers don't get to

2998
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:08,690
thermodynamics observers don't get to
 

2999
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:10,120
thermodynamics observers don't get to
say the position of every single

3000
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:10,130
say the position of every single
 

3001
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:12,970
say the position of every single
molecule and a gas they can only see the

3002
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:12,980
molecule and a gas they can only see the
 

3003
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:14,680
molecule and a gas they can only see the
kind of large scale features and that's

3004
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:14,690
kind of large scale features and that's
 

3005
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:16,839
kind of large scale features and that's
why the second law of thermodynamics law

3006
00:58:16,839 --> 00:58:16,849
why the second law of thermodynamics law
 

3007
00:58:16,849 --> 00:58:19,030
why the second law of thermodynamics law
of entropy increased and so on works if

3008
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:19,040
of entropy increased and so on works if
 

3009
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,099
of entropy increased and so on works if
you could see every individual molecule

3010
00:58:21,099 --> 00:58:21,109
you could see every individual molecule
 

3011
00:58:21,109 --> 00:58:24,299
you could see every individual molecule
you wouldn't conclude something about

00:59:15,619 --> 00:59:18,400
sort of the textbook definition with
quantum mechanics kind of says that

quantum mechanics kind of says that
 

3057
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:21,789
quantum mechanics kind of says that
there's some there's two worlds one is

there's some there's two worlds one is

make sense of well I think actually the

3064
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:31,250
make sense of well I think actually the
 

3065
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:34,510
make sense of well I think actually the
ideas we've recently had might actually

3066
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:34,520
ideas we've recently had might actually
 

3067
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:39,309
ideas we've recently had might actually
give away into this and that's I don't

3068
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:39,319
give away into this and that's I don't
 

3069
00:59:39,319 --> 00:59:42,280
give away into this and that's I don't
know yet I mean it's I think that's it's

3070
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:42,290
know yet I mean it's I think that's it's
 

3071
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:45,789
know yet I mean it's I think that's it's
a mess I mean the fact is there is a one

3072
00:59:45,789 --> 00:59:45,799
a mess I mean the fact is there is a one
 

3073
00:59:45,799 --> 00:59:47,770
a mess I mean the fact is there is a one
of the things that's interesting and

00:59:47,770 --> 00:59:47,780
of the things that's interesting and
 

3075
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:49,120
of the things that's interesting and
when you know people look at these

3076
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:49,130
when you know people look at these
 

3077
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:51,370
when you know people look at these
models that I started talking about 30

3078
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:51,380
models that I started talking about 30
 

3079
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:52,270
models that I started talking about 30
years ago now

years ago now
 

3081
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,920
years ago now
they say oh no that can't possibly be

3082
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:53,930
they say oh no that can't possibly be
 

3083
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:55,840
they say oh no that can't possibly be
right you know what about quantum

3084
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:55,850
right you know what about quantum
 

3085
00:59:55,850 --> 00:59:58,660
right you know what about quantum
mechanics right you say okay tell me

3086
00:59:58,660 --> 00:59:58,670
mechanics right you say okay tell me
 

3087
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:00,340
mechanics right you say okay tell me
what is the essence of quantum mechanics

3088
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:00,350
what is the essence of quantum mechanics
 

3089
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:01,630
what is the essence of quantum mechanics
what do you want me to be able to

3090
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:01,640
what do you want me to be able to
 

3091
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,610
what do you want me to be able to
reproduce to know that I've got quantum

3092
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:03,620
reproduce to know that I've got quantum
 

3093
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:05,860
reproduce to know that I've got quantum
mechanics so to speak well and that

3094
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:05,870
mechanics so to speak well and that
 

3095
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:07,540
mechanics so to speak well and that
question comes up it comes up very

3096
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:07,550
question comes up it comes up very
 

3097
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:08,920
question comes up it comes up very
operationally actually because we've

3098
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:08,930
operationally actually because we've
 

3099
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:10,150
operationally actually because we've
been doing a bunch of stuff with quantum

3100
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:10,160
been doing a bunch of stuff with quantum
 

3101
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,740
been doing a bunch of stuff with quantum
computing and there are all these

3102
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:11,750
computing and there are all these
 

3103
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:13,120
computing and there are all these
companies that say we have a quantum

3104
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:13,130
companies that say we have a quantum
 

3105
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:15,220
companies that say we have a quantum
computer and we say let's connect to

3106
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:15,230
computer and we say let's connect to
 

3107
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:17,650
computer and we say let's connect to
your API and let's actually run it and

3108
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:17,660
your API and let's actually run it and
 

3109
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:20,500
your API and let's actually run it and
they're like well maybe you shouldn't do

3110
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:20,510
they're like well maybe you shouldn't do
 

3111
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:21,160
they're like well maybe you shouldn't do
that yet

3112
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:21,170
that yet
 

3113
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:23,230
that yet
we're not quite ready yet and one of the

3114
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:23,240
we're not quite ready yet and one of the
 

3115
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:24,640
we're not quite ready yet and one of the
questions that I've been curious about

3116
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:24,650
questions that I've been curious about
 

3117
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:26,890
questions that I've been curious about
is if I have five minutes with a quantum

3118
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:26,900
is if I have five minutes with a quantum
 

3119
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:28,840
is if I have five minutes with a quantum
computer how can I tell if it's really a

3120
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:28,850
computer how can I tell if it's really a
 

3121
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:30,430
computer how can I tell if it's really a
quantum computer or whether it's a

3122
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:30,440
quantum computer or whether it's a
 

3123
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,500
quantum computer or whether it's a
simulator at the other end right and

3124
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:32,510
simulator at the other end right and
 

3125
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:34,360
simulator at the other end right and
turns out it's really hard it turns out

3126
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:34,370
turns out it's really hard it turns out
 

3127
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:36,340
turns out it's really hard it turns out
there isn't it's it's it's like a lot of

3128
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:36,350
there isn't it's it's it's like a lot of
 

3129
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:38,200
there isn't it's it's it's like a lot of
these questions about sort of what is

3130
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:38,210
these questions about sort of what is
 

3131
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:40,390
these questions about sort of what is
intelligence what's life it's soaring

3132
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:40,400
intelligence what's life it's soaring
 

3133
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,460
intelligence what's life it's soaring
tears for quantum computing that's right

3134
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:42,470
tears for quantum computing that's right
 

3135
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:44,410
tears for quantum computing that's right
that's right it's like are you really a

3136
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:44,420
that's right it's like are you really a
 

3137
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:45,940
that's right it's like are you really a
quantum computer and I mean I think

3138
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:45,950
quantum computer and I mean I think
 

3139
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:48,910
quantum computer and I mean I think
simulation the yes exactly is it just a

3140
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:48,920
simulation the yes exactly is it just a
 

3141
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,560
simulation the yes exactly is it just a
simulation or is it really a quantum

3142
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:50,570
simulation or is it really a quantum
 

3143
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:52,420
simulation or is it really a quantum
computer famous you're all over again

computer famous you're all over again
 

3145
01:00:52,430 --> 01:00:56,380
computer famous you're all over again
but but that so you know this this whole

01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:56,390
but but that so you know this this whole
 

3147
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:58,330
but but that so you know this this whole
issue about the sort of mathematical

01:00:58,330 --> 01:00:58,340
issue about the sort of mathematical
 

3149
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:00,940
issue about the sort of mathematical
structure of quantum mechanics and the

experience in which we think definite
 

3155
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:08,560
experience in which we think definite
things happen but as quantum mechanics

3156
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:08,570
things happen but as quantum mechanics
 

3157
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:10,240
things happen but as quantum mechanics
doesn't say definite things ever happen

3158
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:10,250
doesn't say definite things ever happen
 

3159
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,890
doesn't say definite things ever happen
quantum mechanics is all about the

01:01:11,890 --> 01:01:11,900
quantum mechanics is all about the
 

3161
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:13,240
quantum mechanics is all about the
amplitudes for different things to

amplitudes for different things to
 

3163
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:15,970
amplitudes for different things to
happen but yet our thread of

happen but yet our thread of
 

3165
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:19,330
happen but yet our thread of

things are happening but to linger on

3168
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:22,400
things are happening but to linger on
 

3169
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,850
things are happening but to linger on
the point you've kind of mentioned the

3170
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:24,860
the point you've kind of mentioned the
 

3171
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:27,550
the point you've kind of mentioned the
structure that could underlie everything

3172
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:27,560
structure that could underlie everything
 

3173
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:31,270
structure that could underlie everything
in this idea that it could perhaps have

3174
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:31,280
in this idea that it could perhaps have
 

3175
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,070
in this idea that it could perhaps have
something like a structure of a graph

3176
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:33,080
something like a structure of a graph
 

3177
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:36,040
something like a structure of a graph
can you elaborate why your intuition is

3178
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:36,050
can you elaborate why your intuition is
 

3179
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:38,560
can you elaborate why your intuition is
that there's a graph structure of nodes

3180
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:38,570
that there's a graph structure of nodes
 

3181
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:40,470
that there's a graph structure of nodes
and edges and what it might represent

3182
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:40,480
and edges and what it might represent
 

3183
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:45,430
and edges and what it might represent
right okay so the question is what is in

3184
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:45,440
right okay so the question is what is in
 

3185
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,320
right okay so the question is what is in
a sense the most structureless structure

3186
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:47,330
a sense the most structureless structure
 

3187
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:51,390
a sense the most structureless structure
you can imagine right so and in fact

3188
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:51,400
you can imagine right so and in fact
 

3189
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,340
you can imagine right so and in fact
what I've recently realized in the last

3190
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:54,350
what I've recently realized in the last
 

3191
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:57,190
what I've recently realized in the last
year or so I have a new most

3192
01:01:57,190 --> 01:01:57,200
year or so I have a new most
 

3193
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,140
year or so I have a new most
structureless structure by the way the

3194
01:01:59,140 --> 01:01:59,150
structureless structure by the way the
 

3195
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:01,420
structureless structure by the way the
question itself is a beautiful and a

3196
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:01,430
question itself is a beautiful and a
 

3197
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:03,730
question itself is a beautiful and a
powerful one in itself so even without

3198
01:02:03,730 --> 01:02:03,740
powerful one in itself so even without
 

3199
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:05,550
powerful one in itself so even without
an answer just the question is

3200
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:05,560
an answer just the question is
 

3201
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,740
an answer just the question is
strong question right right well what's

3202
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:07,750
strong question right right well what's
 

3203
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:09,990
strong question right right well what's
your new idea well it has to do with

3204
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:10,000
your new idea well it has to do with
 

3205
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:10,710
your new idea well it has to do with
hypergraphs

3206
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:10,720
hypergraphs
 

3207
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,530
hypergraphs
essentially what what is interesting

3208
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:13,540
essentially what what is interesting
 

3209
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:17,810
essentially what what is interesting
about the sort of ID model I have now is

3210
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:17,820
about the sort of ID model I have now is
 

3211
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:19,920
about the sort of ID model I have now is
it's a little bit like what happened

3212
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:19,930
it's a little bit like what happened
 

3213
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:22,170
it's a little bit like what happened
with computation everything that I think

3214
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:22,180
with computation everything that I think
 

3215
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:24,830
with computation everything that I think
of as oh well maybe the model is this I

3216
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:24,840
of as oh well maybe the model is this I
 

3217
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,700
of as oh well maybe the model is this I
discover its equivalent

3218
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:26,710
discover its equivalent
 

3219
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:29,520
discover its equivalent
and that's quite encouraging because

3220
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:29,530
and that's quite encouraging because
 

3221
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:31,830
and that's quite encouraging because
it's like I could say well I'm gonna

3222
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:31,840
it's like I could say well I'm gonna
 

3223
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,630
it's like I could say well I'm gonna
look at trivalent graph the graphs with

3224
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:33,640
look at trivalent graph the graphs with
 

3225
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,130
look at trivalent graph the graphs with
you know three edges for each node and

3226
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:35,140
you know three edges for each node and
 

3227
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:36,810
you know three edges for each node and
so on or I could look at this special

3228
01:02:36,810 --> 01:02:36,820
so on or I could look at this special
 

3229
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:38,580
so on or I could look at this special
kind of graph or I could look at this

3230
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:38,590
kind of graph or I could look at this
 

3231
01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:41,400
kind of graph or I could look at this
kind of algebraic structure and turns

3232
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:41,410
kind of algebraic structure and turns
 

3233
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:43,770
kind of algebraic structure and turns
out that the things I'm now looking at

3234
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:43,780
out that the things I'm now looking at
 

3235
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:46,530
out that the things I'm now looking at
everything that I've imagined that is a

3236
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:46,540
everything that I've imagined that is a
 

3237
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:48,360
everything that I've imagined that is a
plausible type of structuralist

3238
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:48,370
plausible type of structuralist
 

3239
01:02:48,370 --> 01:02:51,240
plausible type of structuralist
structure is equivalent to this so what

3240
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:51,250
structure is equivalent to this so what
 

3241
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:53,970
structure is equivalent to this so what
is it well a typical way to think about

3242
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:53,980
is it well a typical way to think about
 

3243
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:59,400
is it well a typical way to think about
it is well so you might have some some

3244
01:02:59,400 --> 01:02:59,410
it is well so you might have some some
 

3245
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:06,060
it is well so you might have some some
collection of tuples collection of let's

3246
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:06,070
collection of tuples collection of let's
 

3247
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:08,610
collection of tuples collection of let's
say numbers so you might have one three

3248
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:08,620
say numbers so you might have one three
 

3249
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:13,820
say numbers so you might have one three
five two three four little just

3250
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:13,830
five two three four little just
 

3251
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:15,960
five two three four little just
collections of numbers triples of

3252
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:15,970
collections of numbers triples of
 

3253
01:03:15,970 --> 01:03:17,700
collections of numbers triples of
numbers let's say quadruples of numbers

3254
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:17,710
numbers let's say quadruples of numbers
 

3255
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:20,460
numbers let's say quadruples of numbers
pairs of numbers whatever and you have

3256
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:20,470
pairs of numbers whatever and you have
 

3257
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:23,240
pairs of numbers whatever and you have
all these sort of floating little tuples

3258
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:23,250
all these sort of floating little tuples
 

3259
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:26,150
all these sort of floating little tuples
they're not in any particular order and

3260
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:26,160
they're not in any particular order and
 

3261
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,460
they're not in any particular order and
that sort of floating collection of

3262
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:29,470
that sort of floating collection of
 

3263
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:32,420
that sort of floating collection of
tuples and I told you this was abstract

3264
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:32,430
tuples and I told you this was abstract
 

3265
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:35,070
tuples and I told you this was abstract
represents the whole universe the only

3266
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:35,080
represents the whole universe the only
 

3267
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:38,940
represents the whole universe the only
thing that relates them is when a symbol

3268
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:38,950
thing that relates them is when a symbol
 

3269
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:41,970
thing that relates them is when a symbol
is the same it's the same so to speak so

3270
01:03:41,970 --> 01:03:41,980
is the same it's the same so to speak so
 

3271
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:44,010
is the same it's the same so to speak so
if you have two tuples and they contain

3272
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:44,020
if you have two tuples and they contain
 

3273
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:46,140
if you have two tuples and they contain
the same symbol let's say at the same

3274
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:46,150
the same symbol let's say at the same
 

3275
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:47,370
the same symbol let's say at the same
position of the tuple of the first

3276
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:47,380
position of the tuple of the first
 

3277
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:48,980
position of the tuple of the first
element of the tuple then that's

3278
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:48,990
element of the tuple then that's
 

3279
01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:52,890
element of the tuple then that's
represents a relation okay so let me let

3280
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:52,900
represents a relation okay so let me let
 

3281
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:56,340
represents a relation okay so let me let
me try and peel this back Wow okay it's

3282
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:56,350
me try and peel this back Wow okay it's
 

3283
01:03:56,350 --> 01:03:58,320
me try and peel this back Wow okay it's
it's I told you it's abstract but this

3284
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:58,330
it's I told you it's abstract but this
 

3285
01:03:58,330 --> 01:04:00,090
it's I told you it's abstract but this
is this is the this is so the

3286
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:00,100
is this is the this is so the
 

3287
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:02,610
is this is the this is so the
relationship is formed by the same some

3288
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:02,620
relationship is formed by the same some
 

3289
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,560
relationship is formed by the same some
aspect of sameness right but but so

3290
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:04,570
aspect of sameness right but but so
 

3291
01:04:04,570 --> 01:04:06,660
aspect of sameness right but but so
think about it in terms of a graph yeah

3292
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:06,670
think about it in terms of a graph yeah
 

3293
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:09,930
think about it in terms of a graph yeah
so a graph a bunch of nodes let's say

3294
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:09,940
so a graph a bunch of nodes let's say
 

3295
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:12,870
so a graph a bunch of nodes let's say
you number each node okay then what is a

3296
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:12,880
you number each node okay then what is a
 

3297
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:16,020
you number each node okay then what is a
graph a graph is a set of pairs that say

3298
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:16,030
graph a graph is a set of pairs that say
 

3299
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:18,240
graph a graph is a set of pairs that say
this node has an edge connecting it to

3300
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:18,250
this node has an edge connecting it to
 

3301
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:19,300
this node has an edge connecting it to
this other node

3302
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:19,310
this other node
 

3303
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:21,760
this other node
so that's the that's an a graph is just

3304
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:21,770
so that's the that's an a graph is just
 

3305
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:26,380
so that's the that's an a graph is just
a collection of those pairs that say

3306
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:26,390
a collection of those pairs that say
 

3307
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:28,720
a collection of those pairs that say
this node connects to this other node so

3308
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:28,730
this node connects to this other node so
 

3309
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:31,090
this node connects to this other node so
this is a generalization of that in

3310
01:04:31,090 --> 01:04:31,100
this is a generalization of that in
 

3311
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,100
this is a generalization of that in
which instead of having pairs you have

3312
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:33,110
which instead of having pairs you have
 

3313
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:37,000
which instead of having pairs you have
arbitrary and tuples um that's it that's

3314
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:37,010
arbitrary and tuples um that's it that's
 

3315
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:39,730
arbitrary and tuples um that's it that's
the whole story um and now the question

3316
01:04:39,730 --> 01:04:39,740
the whole story um and now the question
 

3317
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:41,890
the whole story um and now the question
is okay so that might be that might

3318
01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:41,900
is okay so that might be that might
 

3319
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:43,840
is okay so that might be that might
represent the state of the universe how

3320
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:43,850
represent the state of the universe how
 

3321
01:04:43,850 --> 01:04:45,310
represent the state of the universe how
does the universe evolved what does the

3322
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:45,320
does the universe evolved what does the
 

3323
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:47,680
does the universe evolved what does the
end of us do and so the answer is that

3324
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:47,690
end of us do and so the answer is that
 

3325
01:04:47,690 --> 01:04:50,920
end of us do and so the answer is that
what I'm looking at is transformation

3326
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:50,930
what I'm looking at is transformation
 

3327
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:53,440
what I'm looking at is transformation
rules on these hyper graphs in other

3328
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:53,450
rules on these hyper graphs in other
 

3329
01:04:53,450 --> 01:04:58,240
rules on these hyper graphs in other
words you say this whenever you see a a

3330
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:58,250
words you say this whenever you see a a
 

3331
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:00,790
words you say this whenever you see a a
piece of this hyper graph that looks

3332
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:00,800
piece of this hyper graph that looks
 

3333
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:03,580
piece of this hyper graph that looks
like this turn it into a piece of hyper

3334
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:03,590
like this turn it into a piece of hyper
 

3335
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:05,890
like this turn it into a piece of hyper
graph that looks like this so on a graph

3336
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:05,900
graph that looks like this so on a graph
 

3337
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:08,020
graph that looks like this so on a graph
it might be when you see the sub graph

3338
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:08,030
it might be when you see the sub graph
 

3339
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:09,310
it might be when you see the sub graph
when you see this thing with a bunch of

3340
01:05:09,310 --> 01:05:09,320
when you see this thing with a bunch of
 

3341
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:10,960
when you see this thing with a bunch of
edges hanging out in this particular way

3342
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:10,970
edges hanging out in this particular way
 

3343
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:13,600
edges hanging out in this particular way
then rewrite it as this other graph

3344
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:13,610
then rewrite it as this other graph
 

3345
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:14,350
then rewrite it as this other graph
mm-hm

3346
01:05:14,350 --> 01:05:14,360
mm-hm
 

3347
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:17,650
mm-hm
okay and so that's the whole story so

3348
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:17,660
okay and so that's the whole story so
 

3349
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:21,250
okay and so that's the whole story so
the question is what so now you say I

3350
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:21,260
the question is what so now you say I
 

3351
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:24,430
the question is what so now you say I
mean think as I say this is quite

3352
01:05:24,430 --> 01:05:24,440
mean think as I say this is quite
 

3353
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:27,210
mean think as I say this is quite
abstract and one of the questions is

3354
01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:27,220
abstract and one of the questions is
 

3355
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:29,800
abstract and one of the questions is
where do you do those updating so you've

3356
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:29,810
where do you do those updating so you've
 

3357
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:31,540
where do you do those updating so you've
got this giant graph what triggers

3358
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:31,550
got this giant graph what triggers
 

3359
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:33,820
got this giant graph what triggers
outdating like what's the what's the

3360
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:33,830
outdating like what's the what's the
 

3361
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:37,360
outdating like what's the what's the
ripple effect of it is it yeah and I I

3362
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:37,370
ripple effect of it is it yeah and I I
 

3363
01:05:37,370 --> 01:05:38,530
ripple effect of it is it yeah and I I
suspect

3364
01:05:38,530 --> 01:05:38,540
suspect
 

3365
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:41,220
suspect
everything's discrete even in time so

3366
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:41,230
everything's discrete even in time so
 

3367
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:43,390
everything's discrete even in time so
okay so the question is where do you do

3368
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:43,400
okay so the question is where do you do
 

3369
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,430
okay so the question is where do you do
the updates yes and the answer is the

3370
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:45,440
the updates yes and the answer is the
 

3371
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,200
the updates yes and the answer is the
rule is you do them wherever they apply

3372
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:47,210
rule is you do them wherever they apply
 

3373
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:50,230
rule is you do them wherever they apply
and you do them you do them the order in

3374
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:50,240
and you do them you do them the order in
 

3375
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,270
and you do them you do them the order in
which the updates is done is not defined

3376
01:05:52,270 --> 01:05:52,280
which the updates is done is not defined
 

3377
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:55,210
which the updates is done is not defined
that is the you can do them so there may

3378
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:55,220
that is the you can do them so there may
 

3379
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:56,770
that is the you can do them so there may
be many possible orderings for these

3380
01:05:56,770 --> 01:05:56,780
be many possible orderings for these
 

3381
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:59,590
be many possible orderings for these
updates now the point is if imagine

3382
01:05:59,590 --> 01:05:59,600
updates now the point is if imagine
 

3383
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:02,290
updates now the point is if imagine
you're an observer in this universe so

3384
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:02,300
you're an observer in this universe so
 

3385
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:04,660
you're an observer in this universe so
and you say did something get updated

3386
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:04,670
and you say did something get updated
 

3387
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:07,900
and you say did something get updated
well you don't in any sense know until

3388
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:07,910
well you don't in any sense know until
 

3389
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:11,650
well you don't in any sense know until
you yourself have been updated right so

3390
01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:11,660
you yourself have been updated right so
 

3391
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:14,470
you yourself have been updated right so
in fact all that you can be sensitive to

3392
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:14,480
in fact all that you can be sensitive to
 

3393
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,740
in fact all that you can be sensitive to
is essentially the causal network of how

3394
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:17,750
is essentially the causal network of how
 

3395
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:21,190
is essentially the causal network of how
an event over there affects an event

3396
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:21,200
an event over there affects an event
 

3397
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,970
an event over there affects an event
that's in you it doesn't even feel like

3398
01:06:23,970 --> 01:06:23,980
that's in you it doesn't even feel like
 

3399
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:26,110
that's in you it doesn't even feel like
observation that's like that's something

3400
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:26,120
observation that's like that's something
 

3401
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,970
observation that's like that's something
else you're just part of the whole thing

3402
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:27,980
else you're just part of the whole thing
 

3403
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:30,100
else you're just part of the whole thing
yes you're part of it but but even to

3404
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:30,110
yes you're part of it but but even to
 

3405
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:33,100
yes you're part of it but but even to
have so the the end result of that is

3406
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:33,110
have so the the end result of that is
 

3407
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:35,230
have so the the end result of that is
you're sensitive to is this causal

3408
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:35,240
you're sensitive to is this causal
 

3409
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:37,300
you're sensitive to is this causal
network of what event effects what other

3410
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:37,310

about sort of the structure of the
 

3415
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,230
about sort of the structure of the

01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:44,240
observer I'm simply saying I'm simply
 

3417
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,230

making the argument that what happens

01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:47,240
making the argument that what happens
 

3419
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:49,530
making the argument that what happens
the microscopic order of these rewrites

3420
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:49,540
the microscopic order of these rewrites
 

3421
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:53,230
the microscopic order of these rewrites
is not something that any observer any

3422
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:53,240
is not something that any observer any
 

3423
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:54,910
is not something that any observer any
conceivable observer in this universe

3424
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:54,920
conceivable observer in this universe
 

3425
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:58,060
conceivable observer in this universe
can be affected by because the the only

3426
01:06:58,060 --> 01:06:58,070
can be affected by because the the only
 

3427
01:06:58,070 --> 01:07:00,160
can be affected by because the the only
thing the observer can be affected by is

3428
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:00,170
thing the observer can be affected by is
 

3429
01:07:00,170 --> 01:07:04,060
thing the observer can be affected by is
this causal network of how the events in

3430
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:04,070
this causal network of how the events in
 

3431
01:07:04,070 --> 01:07:06,700
this causal network of how the events in
the observer are affected by other

3432
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:06,710
the observer are affected by other
 

3433
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:08,230
the observer are affected by other
events that happen in the universe so

3434
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:08,240
events that happen in the universe so
 

3435
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,400
events that happen in the universe so
the only thing you have to look at is

3436
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:09,410
the only thing you have to look at is
 

3437
01:07:09,410 --> 01:07:11,260
the only thing you have to look at is
the causal network you don't really have

3438
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:11,270
the causal network you don't really have
 

3439
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:13,030
the causal network you don't really have
to look at this microscopic rewriting

3440
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:13,040
to look at this microscopic rewriting
 

3441
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:15,220
to look at this microscopic rewriting
that's happening so these rewrites are

3442
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:15,230
that's happening so these rewrites are
 

3443
01:07:15,230 --> 01:07:17,290
that's happening so these rewrites are
happening wherever they they were they

3444
01:07:17,290 --> 01:07:17,300
happening wherever they they were they
 

3445
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,060
happening wherever they they were they
happen wherever they feel like causal

3446
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:19,070
happen wherever they feel like causal
 

3447
01:07:19,070 --> 01:07:21,730
happen wherever they feel like causal
network is there you said that there's

3448
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:21,740
network is there you said that there's
 

3449
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:25,180
network is there you said that there's
not really so the idea would be an

3450
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:25,190
not really so the idea would be an
 

3451
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:28,330
not really so the idea would be an
undefined like what gets updated the the

3452
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:28,340
undefined like what gets updated the the
 

3453
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:30,610
undefined like what gets updated the the
sequence of things is undefined it's a

3454
01:07:30,610 --> 01:07:30,620
sequence of things is undefined it's a
 

3455
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:34,120
sequence of things is undefined it's a
yes that's what you mean by the causal

3456
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:34,130
yes that's what you mean by the causal
 

3457
01:07:34,130 --> 01:07:35,710
yes that's what you mean by the causal
network then the cop no the causal

3458
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:35,720
network then the cop no the causal
 

3459
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:37,900
network then the cop no the causal
network is given that an update has

3460
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:37,910
network is given that an update has
 

3461
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:40,210
network is given that an update has
happened that's an event then the

3462
01:07:40,210 --> 01:07:40,220
happened that's an event then the
 

3463
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:42,700
happened that's an event then the
question is is that event causally

3464
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:42,710
question is is that event causally
 

3465
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:44,920
question is is that event causally
related to does that event if that event

3466
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:44,930
related to does that event if that event
 

3467
01:07:44,930 --> 01:07:47,380
related to does that event if that event
didn't happen then some future event

3468
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:47,390
didn't happen then some future event
 

3469
01:07:47,390 --> 01:07:49,360
didn't happen then some future event
couldn't happen yet gotcha

3470
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:49,370
couldn't happen yet gotcha
 

3471
01:07:49,370 --> 01:07:51,460
couldn't happen yet gotcha
and so you build up this network of what

3472
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:51,470
and so you build up this network of what
 

3473
01:07:51,470 --> 01:07:54,790
and so you build up this network of what
effects what okay and so what that does

3474
01:07:54,790 --> 01:07:54,800
effects what okay and so what that does
 

3475
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:57,640
effects what okay and so what that does
so when you build up that network that's

3476
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:57,650
so when you build up that network that's
 

3477
01:07:57,650 --> 01:07:59,950
so when you build up that network that's
kind of the observable aspect of the

3478
01:07:59,950 --> 01:07:59,960
kind of the observable aspect of the
 

3479
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,660
kind of the observable aspect of the
universe in some sense yeah

3480
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:01,670
universe in some sense yeah
 

3481
01:08:01,670 --> 01:08:03,760
universe in some sense yeah
um and so then you can ask questions

3482
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:03,770
um and so then you can ask questions
 

3483
01:08:03,770 --> 01:08:05,950
um and so then you can ask questions
about you know how robust is that

3484
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:05,960
about you know how robust is that
 

3485
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:08,380
about you know how robust is that
observable ass network of the what's

3486
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:08,390
observable ass network of the what's
 

3487
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:10,360
observable ass network of the what's
happening in the universe okay so here's

3488
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:10,370
happening in the universe okay so here's
 

3489
01:08:10,370 --> 01:08:11,680
happening in the universe okay so here's
where it starts getting kind of

3490
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:11,690
where it starts getting kind of
 

3491
01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:14,350
where it starts getting kind of
interesting so for certain kinds of

3492
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:14,360
interesting so for certain kinds of
 

3493
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:16,900
interesting so for certain kinds of
microscopic rewriting rules the order of

3494
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:16,910
microscopic rewriting rules the order of
 

3495
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:19,360
microscopic rewriting rules the order of
rewrites does not matter to the causal

3496
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:19,370
rewrites does not matter to the causal
 

3497
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:22,330
rewrites does not matter to the causal
network and so this is okay mathematical

3498
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:22,340
network and so this is okay mathematical
 

3499
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:25,240
network and so this is okay mathematical
logic moment this is equivalent to the

3500
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:25,250
logic moment this is equivalent to the
 

3501
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:26,980
logic moment this is equivalent to the
church-rosser property of a confluence

3502
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:26,990
church-rosser property of a confluence
 

3503
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:29,110
church-rosser property of a confluence
property of rewrite rules and it's the

3504
01:08:29,110 --> 01:08:29,120
property of rewrite rules and it's the
 

3505
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,910
property of rewrite rules and it's the
same reason that if you are simplifying

3506
01:08:30,910 --> 01:08:30,920
same reason that if you are simplifying
 

3507
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:33,280
same reason that if you are simplifying
an algebraic expression for example you

3508
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:33,290
an algebraic expression for example you
 

3509
01:08:33,290 --> 01:08:35,410
an algebraic expression for example you
can say oh let me expand those terms out

3510
01:08:35,410 --> 01:08:35,420
can say oh let me expand those terms out
 

3511
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:37,450
can say oh let me expand those terms out
let me factor those pieces doesn't

3512
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:37,460
let me factor those pieces doesn't
 

3513
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:39,070
let me factor those pieces doesn't
matter what order you do that in you'll

3514
01:08:39,070 --> 01:08:39,080
matter what order you do that in you'll
 

3515
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:40,960
matter what order you do that in you'll
always get the same answer and that's

3516
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:40,970
always get the same answer and that's
 

3517
01:08:40,970 --> 01:08:43,240
always get the same answer and that's
it's the same fundamental phenomenon

3518
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:43,250
it's the same fundamental phenomenon
 

3519
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:45,850
it's the same fundamental phenomenon
that causes for certain kinds of

3520
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:45,860
that causes for certain kinds of
 

3521
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:47,050
that causes for certain kinds of
microscopic rewrite

3522
01:08:47,050 --> 01:08:47,060
microscopic rewrite
 

3523
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:49,740
microscopic rewrite
that causes the causal network to be

3524
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:49,750
that causes the causal network to be
 

3525
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:52,360
that causes the causal network to be
independent of the microscopic order of

3526
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:52,370
independent of the microscopic order of
 

3527
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:54,430
independent of the microscopic order of
rewritings why is there properly

3528
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:54,440
rewritings why is there properly
 

3529
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,800
rewritings why is there properly
important because it implies special

3530
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:56,810
important because it implies special
 

3531
01:08:56,810 --> 01:09:00,280
important because it implies special
relativity I mean the reason what the

3532
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:00,290
relativity I mean the reason what the
 

3533
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:02,789
relativity I mean the reason what the
reason it's important is that that

3534
01:09:02,789 --> 01:09:02,799
reason it's important is that that
 

3535
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:06,999
reason it's important is that that
property special relativity says you can

3536
01:09:06,999 --> 01:09:07,009
property special relativity says you can
 

3537
01:09:07,009 --> 01:09:10,840
property special relativity says you can
look at these sort of you can look at

01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:10,850
look at these sort of you can look at
 

3539
01:09:10,850 --> 01:09:12,249
look at these sort of you can look at
different reference frames you can have

3540
01:09:12,249 --> 01:09:12,259
different reference frames you can have
 

3541
01:09:12,259 --> 01:09:14,170
different reference frames you can have
different you can be looking at your

01:09:14,170 --> 01:09:14,180
different you can be looking at your
 

3543
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:16,749
different you can be looking at your
notion of what space and what's time can

3544
01:09:16,749 --> 01:09:16,759
notion of what space and what's time can
 

3545
01:09:16,759 --> 01:09:18,340
notion of what space and what's time can
be different depending on whether you're

3546
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:18,350
be different depending on whether you're
 

3547
01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:19,840
be different depending on whether you're
traveling at a certain speed depending

traveling at a certain speed depending
 

3549
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:20,680
traveling at a certain speed depending
on whether you're doing this that and

3550
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:20,690
on whether you're doing this that and
 

3551
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:23,140
on whether you're doing this that and
the other but nevertheless the laws of

3552
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:23,150
the other but nevertheless the laws of
 

3553
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:24,460
the other but nevertheless the laws of
physics are the same that's what the

3554
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:24,470
physics are the same that's what the
 

3555
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:26,440
physics are the same that's what the
principle special relativity says

3556
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:26,450
principle special relativity says
 

3557
01:09:26,450 --> 01:09:28,150
principle special relativity says
there's the laws of physics are the same

3558
01:09:28,150 --> 01:09:28,160
there's the laws of physics are the same
 

3559
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,430
there's the laws of physics are the same
independent of your reference frame well

3560
01:09:30,430 --> 01:09:30,440
independent of your reference frame well
 

3561
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:34,960
independent of your reference frame well
turns out this sort of change of the

3562
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:34,970
turns out this sort of change of the
 

3563
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:36,940
turns out this sort of change of the
microscopic rewriting order is

3564
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:36,950
microscopic rewriting order is
 

3565
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:38,380
microscopic rewriting order is
essentially equivalent to a change of

3566
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:38,390
essentially equivalent to a change of
 

3567
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:39,849
essentially equivalent to a change of
reference frame or at least there's a

3568
01:09:39,849 --> 01:09:39,859
reference frame or at least there's a
 

3569
01:09:39,859 --> 01:09:42,130
reference frame or at least there's a
sub part of how that works that's a call

3570
01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:42,140
sub part of how that works that's a call
 

3571
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:43,840
sub part of how that works that's a call
interchange a reference frame so

3572
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:43,850
interchange a reference frame so
 

3573
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:46,120
interchange a reference frame so
somewhat surprisingly and sort of for

3574
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:46,130
somewhat surprisingly and sort of for
 

3575
01:09:46,130 --> 01:09:49,210
somewhat surprisingly and sort of for
the first time and forever it's possible

3576
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:49,220
the first time and forever it's possible
 

3577
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:51,760
the first time and forever it's possible
for an underlying microscopic theory to

3578
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:51,770
for an underlying microscopic theory to
 

3579
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:53,890
for an underlying microscopic theory to
imply special relativity to be able to

01:09:53,890 --> 01:09:53,900
imply special relativity to be able to
 

3581
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:55,450
imply special relativity to be able to
derive it it's not something you put in

3582
01:09:55,450 --> 01:09:55,460
derive it it's not something you put in
 

3583
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:59,440
derive it it's not something you put in

other property causal invariance which

3586
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:02,060
other property causal invariance which
 

3587
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:04,300
other property causal invariance which
is also the property that implies that

3588
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:04,310
is also the property that implies that
 

3589
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:06,310
is also the property that implies that
there's a single thread of time in the

01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,950
there's a single thread of time in the
universe it might not be the case that

3592
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:08,960
universe it might not be the case that
 

3593
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,380
universe it might not be the case that
that's that is the that's what would

3594
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:11,390
that's that is the that's what would
 

3595
01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:14,320
that's that is the that's what would
lead to the possibility of an observer

3596
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:14,330
lead to the possibility of an observer
 

3597
01:10:14,330 --> 01:10:16,090
lead to the possibility of an observer
thinking that definite stuff happens

3598
01:10:16,090 --> 01:10:16,100
thinking that definite stuff happens
 

3599
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:18,070
thinking that definite stuff happens
otherwise you've got all these possible

3600
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:18,080
otherwise you've got all these possible
 

3601
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,140
otherwise you've got all these possible
rewriting orders and who's to say which

3602
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:20,150
rewriting orders and who's to say which
 

3603
01:10:20,150 --> 01:10:22,030
rewriting orders and who's to say which
one occurred but with this causal

3604
01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:22,040
one occurred but with this causal
 

3605
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:23,350
one occurred but with this causal
invariance property there's a there's a

3606
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:23,360
invariance property there's a there's a
 

3607
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,570
invariance property there's a there's a
notion of a definite threat of time it

3608
01:10:25,570 --> 01:10:25,580
notion of a definite threat of time it
 

3609
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:27,700
notion of a definite threat of time it
sounds like that kind of idea of time

3610
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:27,710
sounds like that kind of idea of time
 

3611
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:30,160
sounds like that kind of idea of time
even space would be emergent from the

3612
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:30,170
even space would be emergent from the
 

3613
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:32,410
even space would be emergent from the
system oh yeah no it's not a fundamental

3614
01:10:32,410 --> 01:10:32,420
system oh yeah no it's not a fundamental
 

3615
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:35,770
system oh yeah no it's not a fundamental
part of the fundamental level all you've

3616
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:35,780
part of the fundamental level all you've
 

3617
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:37,270
part of the fundamental level all you've
got is a bunch of nodes connected by

3618
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:37,280
got is a bunch of nodes connected by
 

3619
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,490
got is a bunch of nodes connected by
hyper edges or whatever so there's no

3620
01:10:39,490 --> 01:10:39,500
hyper edges or whatever so there's no
 

3621
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,440
hyper edges or whatever so there's no
time there's not space that's right and

3622
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:41,450
time there's not space that's right and
 

3623
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:43,780
time there's not space that's right and
but but the the thing is that it's just

3624
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:43,790
but but the the thing is that it's just
 

3625
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:45,580
but but the the thing is that it's just
like imagining imagine you're just

3626
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:45,590
like imagining imagine you're just
 

3627
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:47,650
like imagining imagine you're just
dealing with a graph and imagine you

3628
01:10:47,650 --> 01:10:47,660
dealing with a graph and imagine you
 

3629
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:48,970
dealing with a graph and imagine you
have something like a you know like a

3630
01:10:48,970 --> 01:10:48,980
have something like a you know like a
 

3631
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:50,860
have something like a you know like a
honeycomb graph we have a hexagon bunch

3632
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:50,870
honeycomb graph we have a hexagon bunch
 

3633
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:51,750
honeycomb graph we have a hexagon bunch
a hexagon

3634
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:51,760
a hexagon
 

3635
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,370
a hexagon
you know that graph at a microscopic

3636
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:54,380
you know that graph at a microscopic
 

3637
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:56,200
you know that graph at a microscopic
level is just a bunch of nodes connected

3638
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:56,210
level is just a bunch of nodes connected
 

3639
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:57,850
level is just a bunch of nodes connected
to other nodes but at a microscopic

3640
01:10:57,850 --> 01:10:57,860
to other nodes but at a microscopic
 

3641
01:10:57,860 --> 01:10:59,350
to other nodes but at a microscopic
level you say that looks like a

3642
01:10:59,350 --> 01:10:59,360
level you say that looks like a
 

3643
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:00,390
level you say that looks like a
honeycomb you know

3644
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:00,400
honeycomb you know
 

3645
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,700
honeycomb you know
it's lattice it looks like a

3646
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:02,710
it's lattice it looks like a
 

3647
01:11:02,710 --> 01:11:05,490
it's lattice it looks like a
two-dimensional you know manifold of

3648
01:11:05,490 --> 01:11:05,500
two-dimensional you know manifold of
 

3649
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:06,330
two-dimensional you know manifold of
some kind it looks like a

3650
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:06,340
some kind it looks like a
 

3651
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:08,550
some kind it looks like a
two-dimensional thing if you connect it

3652
01:11:08,550 --> 01:11:08,560
two-dimensional thing if you connect it
 

3653
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,780
two-dimensional thing if you connect it
differently if you just connect all the

3654
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:09,790
differently if you just connect all the
 

3655
01:11:09,790 --> 01:11:12,090
differently if you just connect all the
nodes one one to another and kind of a

3656
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:12,100
nodes one one to another and kind of a
 

3657
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:14,189
nodes one one to another and kind of a
sort of linked list type structure then

3658
01:11:14,189 --> 01:11:14,199
sort of linked list type structure then
 

3659
01:11:14,199 --> 01:11:15,180
sort of linked list type structure then
you'd say well that looks like a

3660
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:15,190
you'd say well that looks like a
 

3661
01:11:15,190 --> 01:11:17,820
you'd say well that looks like a
one-dimensional space but at the

3662
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:17,830
one-dimensional space but at the
 

3663
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:19,439
one-dimensional space but at the
microscopic level all these are just

3664
01:11:19,439 --> 01:11:19,449
microscopic level all these are just
 

3665
01:11:19,449 --> 01:11:21,660
microscopic level all these are just
networks with nodes the macroscopic

3666
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:21,670
networks with nodes the macroscopic
 

3667
01:11:21,670 --> 01:11:23,729
networks with nodes the macroscopic
level they look like something that's

3668
01:11:23,729 --> 01:11:23,739
level they look like something that's
 

3669
01:11:23,739 --> 01:11:25,709
level they look like something that's
like one of our sort of familiar kinds

3670
01:11:25,709 --> 01:11:25,719
like one of our sort of familiar kinds
 

3671
01:11:25,719 --> 01:11:27,750
like one of our sort of familiar kinds
of space and it's the same thing with

3672
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:27,760
of space and it's the same thing with
 

3673
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:30,209
of space and it's the same thing with
these hyper graphs now if you ask me

3674
01:11:30,209 --> 01:11:30,219
these hyper graphs now if you ask me
 

3675
01:11:30,219 --> 01:11:32,010
these hyper graphs now if you ask me
have I found one that gives me three

3676
01:11:32,010 --> 01:11:32,020
have I found one that gives me three
 

3677
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:33,750
have I found one that gives me three
dimensional space the answer is not yet

3678
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:33,760
dimensional space the answer is not yet
 

3679
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:36,540
dimensional space the answer is not yet
so we don't know this is one of these

3680
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:36,550
so we don't know this is one of these
 

3681
01:11:36,550 --> 01:11:38,160
so we don't know this is one of these
things we're kind of betting against

3682
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:38,170
things we're kind of betting against
 

3683
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:40,590
things we're kind of betting against
nature so to speak and I have no way to

01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:40,600
nature so to speak and I have no way to
 

3685
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,390
nature so to speak and I have no way to
know I mean so there are many other

3686
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:42,400
know I mean so there are many other
 

3687
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,580
know I mean so there are many other
properties of this this kind of system

3688
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:44,590
properties of this this kind of system
 

3689
01:11:44,590 --> 01:11:46,770
properties of this this kind of system
that have are very beautiful actually

3690
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:46,780
that have are very beautiful actually
 

3691
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:49,740
that have are very beautiful actually
and very suggestive and it will be very

3693
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:51,270
and very suggestive and it will be very
elegant if this turns out to be right

3694
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:51,280
elegant if this turns out to be right
 

3695
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:53,310
elegant if this turns out to be right
because it's very it's very clean and

you'll get everything it's that um if we
 

3729
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:39,240
you'll get everything it's that um if we
get to that point and we look at what is

01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:39,250
get to that point and we look at what is
 

3731
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:41,250
get to that point and we look at what is
this thing what is this rule that we

01:12:58,439 --> 01:12:58,449
language code so that's I wasn't sure is
 

3749
01:12:58,449 --> 01:13:00,090
language code so that's I wasn't sure is
going to happen that way but it's it's a

going to happen that way but it's it's a

that's um it's kind of now we don't know

that's simple and so I haven't wrapped

3806
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:08,560
that's simple and so I haven't wrapped
 

3807
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:11,790
that's simple and so I haven't wrapped
my brain around that asou yet if indeed

problem is we don't get to say much

3826
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:34,150
problem is we don't get to say much
 

3827

about what's outside our universe
 

3829
01:14:35,230 --> 01:14:37,500
about what's outside our universe
because by definition our universe is

because by definition our universe is

interesting question I don't think that

01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:50,050
interesting question I don't think that
 

3841
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:53,220
interesting question I don't think that
if you ask the question could we and it

if you ask the question could we and it

3851
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,740
it built in on purpose hard to say
that's the same thing as saying we see a

3852
01:15:04,740 --> 01:15:04,750
that's the same thing as saying we see a
 

3853
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:08,160
that's the same thing as saying we see a

somewhere and it's a series of pulses
and you know it's a periodic series of

and you know it's a periodic series of

01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:19,410
pulses let's say was that done on
purpose can we conclude something about

3864
01:15:19,410 --> 01:15:19,420
purpose can we conclude something about
 

3865
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:21,540
purpose can we conclude something about
the origin of that series of pulses just

3866
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:21,550
the origin of that series of pulses just

01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:23,280
the origin of that series of pulses just
because it's elegant does not

01:15:23,290 --> 01:15:27,060
because it's elegant does not
necessarily mean that somebody created

can even comprehend yeah well yeah I

it's the ultimate version of that is was

it's the ultimate version of that is was

01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:41,180
it's the ultimate version of that is was
our universe a piece of technology so to

signature there it's gonna be you know
made by so-and-so but there's no way we

3900
01:15:58,310 --> 01:15:58,320
made by so-and-so but there's no way we
 

3901
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,140
made by so-and-so but there's no way we
could understand that sort of speaking

3902
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:00,150
could understand that sort of speaking
 

3903
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:01,209
could understand that sort of speaking
it's not clear what that would mean

3904
01:16:01,209 --> 01:16:01,219
it's not clear what that would mean
 

3905
01:16:01,219 --> 01:16:05,510
it's not clear what that would mean
because the universe simply you know

3906
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:05,520
because the universe simply you know
 

3907
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,320
because the universe simply you know
this if we find a rule for the universe

01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:08,330
this if we find a rule for the universe
 

3909
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:10,970
this if we find a rule for the universe
we're not we're simply saying that rule

3910
01:16:10,970 --> 01:16:10,980
we're not we're simply saying that rule
 

3911
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:13,910
we're not we're simply saying that rule
represents what our universe does we're

01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:13,920
represents what our universe does we're
 

3913
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,130
represents what our universe does we're
not saying that that rule is something

01:16:16,130 --> 01:16:16,140
not saying that that rule is something

running on a big computer and making our
 

3917
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,720
running on a big computer and making our
universe it's just saying that

represents what our universe does in the
 

3921
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,170

what mechanical systems do it's not that
 

3929
01:16:30,810 --> 01:16:32,900
what mechanical systems do it's not that

just representing the behavior of those

3938
01:16:41,209 --> 01:16:41,219
systems so what's the gap in your sense
 

3939
01:16:41,219 --> 01:16:44,060
systems so what's the gap in your sense
to linger and the fascinating perhaps

01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:44,070
to linger and the fascinating perhaps
 

3941
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:46,070
to linger and the fascinating perhaps
slightly sci-fi a question what's the

3942
01:16:46,070 --> 01:16:46,080
slightly sci-fi a question what's the
 

3943
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:48,410
slightly sci-fi a question what's the
gap between understanding the

3944
01:16:48,410 --> 01:16:48,420
gap between understanding the
 

3945
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:50,540
gap between understanding the
fundamental rules that create a universe

01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:50,550
fundamental rules that create a universe
 

3947
01:16:50,550 --> 01:16:53,780
fundamental rules that create a universe
and engineering a system actually

3948
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:53,790
and engineering a system actually
 

3949
01:16:53,790 --> 01:16:55,880
and engineering a system actually
creating a simulation ourselves so

3950
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:55,890
creating a simulation ourselves so
 

3951
01:16:55,890 --> 01:16:58,400
creating a simulation ourselves so
you've talked about sort of you've

3952
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:58,410
you've talked about sort of you've
 

3953
01:16:58,410 --> 01:17:00,830
you've talked about sort of you've
talked about you know nano engineering

3954
01:17:00,830 --> 01:17:00,840
talked about you know nano engineering
 

3955
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:03,110
talked about you know nano engineering
kind of ideas that are kind of exciting

3956
01:17:03,110 --> 01:17:03,120
kind of ideas that are kind of exciting
 

3957
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,910
kind of ideas that are kind of exciting
actually creating some ideas of

3958
01:17:04,910 --> 01:17:04,920
actually creating some ideas of
 

3959
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,890
actually creating some ideas of
computation in the physical space how

3960
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:06,900
computation in the physical space how
 

3961
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:08,990
computation in the physical space how
hard it is is it as an engineering

3962
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:09,000
hard it is is it as an engineering
 

3963
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,760
hard it is is it as an engineering
problem to create the universe once you

3964
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:10,770
problem to create the universe once you
 

3965
01:17:10,770 --> 01:17:12,979
problem to create the universe once you
know the rules the Creator and well it's

3966
01:17:12,979 --> 01:17:12,989
know the rules the Creator and well it's
 

3967
01:17:12,989 --> 01:17:14,450
know the rules the Creator and well it's
an interesting question I think the

3968
01:17:14,450 --> 01:17:14,460
an interesting question I think the
 

3969
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:16,670
an interesting question I think the
substrate on which the universe is

3970
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:16,680
substrate on which the universe is
 

3971
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:18,560
substrate on which the universe is
operating is not a substrate that we

3972
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:18,570
operating is not a substrate that we
 

3973
01:17:18,570 --> 01:17:20,570
operating is not a substrate that we
have access to I mean the only substrate

3974
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:20,580
have access to I mean the only substrate
 

3975
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:23,390
have access to I mean the only substrate
we have is that same substrate that the

3976
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:23,400
we have is that same substrate that the
 

3977
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,550
we have is that same substrate that the
universe is operating in so if the

3978
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:25,560
universe is operating in so if the
 

3979
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,260
universe is operating in so if the
universe is a bunch of hypergraphs being

3980
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:27,270
universe is a bunch of hypergraphs being
 

3981
01:17:27,270 --> 01:17:29,840
universe is a bunch of hypergraphs being
rewritten then we get to attach

3982
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:29,850
rewritten then we get to attach
 

3983
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:31,640
rewritten then we get to attach
ourselves to those same hypergraphs

3984
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:31,650
ourselves to those same hypergraphs
 

3985
01:17:31,650 --> 01:17:35,930
ourselves to those same hypergraphs
being rewritten we don't get to and if

3986
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:35,940
being rewritten we don't get to and if
 

3987
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:37,940
being rewritten we don't get to and if
you ask the question you know is the

3988
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:37,950
you ask the question you know is the
 

3989
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:40,160
you ask the question you know is the
code clean you know is you know can we

3990
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:40,170
code clean you know is you know can we
 

3991
01:17:40,170 --> 01:17:41,750
code clean you know is you know can we
write nice elegant code

3992
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:41,760
write nice elegant code
 

3993
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:45,109
write nice elegant code
with efficient algorithms and so on well

3994
01:17:45,109 --> 01:17:45,119
with efficient algorithms and so on well
 

3995
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:47,029
with efficient algorithms and so on well
that's an interesting question how how

3996
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:47,039
that's an interesting question how how
 

3997
01:17:47,039 --> 01:17:48,649
that's an interesting question how how
you know that's this question of how

3998
01:17:48,649 --> 01:17:48,659
you know that's this question of how
 

3999
01:17:48,659 --> 01:17:50,629
you know that's this question of how
much computational reducibility there is

4000
01:17:50,629 --> 01:17:50,639
much computational reducibility there is
 

4001
01:17:50,639 --> 01:17:52,609
much computational reducibility there is
in the system but so I've seen some

4002
01:17:52,609 --> 01:17:52,619
in the system but so I've seen some
 

4003
01:17:52,619 --> 01:17:54,049
in the system but so I've seen some
beautiful cellular automata that

4004
01:17:54,049 --> 01:17:54,059
beautiful cellular automata that
 

4005
01:17:54,059 --> 01:17:55,879
beautiful cellular automata that
basically create copies of itself within

4006
01:17:55,879 --> 01:17:55,889
basically create copies of itself within
 

4007
01:17:55,889 --> 01:17:58,220
basically create copies of itself within
itself right that's the question whether

4008
01:17:58,220 --> 01:17:58,230
itself right that's the question whether
 

4009
01:17:58,230 --> 01:18:01,279
itself right that's the question whether
it's possible to create like whether you

4010
01:18:01,279 --> 01:18:01,289
it's possible to create like whether you
 

4011
01:18:01,289 --> 01:18:02,870
it's possible to create like whether you
need to understand the substrate or

4012
01:18:02,870 --> 01:18:02,880
need to understand the substrate or
 

4013
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,209
need to understand the substrate or
whether you can just yeah well right I

4014
01:18:05,209 --> 01:18:05,219
whether you can just yeah well right I
 

4015
01:18:05,219 --> 01:18:07,520
whether you can just yeah well right I
mean so one of the things that is sort

4016
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:07,530
mean so one of the things that is sort
 

4017
01:18:07,530 --> 01:18:09,830
mean so one of the things that is sort
of one of my slightly sci-fi thoughts

4018
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:09,840
of one of my slightly sci-fi thoughts
 

4019
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,439
of one of my slightly sci-fi thoughts
about the future so to speak is you know

4020
01:18:12,439 --> 01:18:12,449
about the future so to speak is you know
 

4021
01:18:12,449 --> 01:18:14,750
about the future so to speak is you know
right now if you pol typical people who

4022
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:14,760
right now if you pol typical people who
 

4023
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:16,310
right now if you pol typical people who
say do you think it's important to find

4024
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:16,320
say do you think it's important to find
 

4025
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,709
say do you think it's important to find
the fundamental theory of physics you

4026
01:18:18,709 --> 01:18:18,719
the fundamental theory of physics you
 

4027
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:20,509
the fundamental theory of physics you
get because I've done this poll

4028
01:18:20,509 --> 01:18:20,519
get because I've done this poll
 

4029
01:18:20,519 --> 01:18:22,879
get because I've done this poll
informally at least it's curious

4030
01:18:22,879 --> 01:18:22,889
informally at least it's curious
 

4031
01:18:22,889 --> 01:18:24,979
informally at least it's curious
actually you get a decent fraction of

4032
01:18:24,979 --> 01:18:24,989
actually you get a decent fraction of
 

4033
01:18:24,989 --> 01:18:26,240
actually you get a decent fraction of
people saying oh yeah that would be

4034
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:26,250
people saying oh yeah that would be
 

4035
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:28,279
people saying oh yeah that would be
pretty interesting I think that's

4036
01:18:28,279 --> 01:18:28,289
pretty interesting I think that's
 

4037
01:18:28,289 --> 01:18:31,640
pretty interesting I think that's
becoming surprisingly enough more I mean

4038
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:31,650
becoming surprisingly enough more I mean
 

4039
01:18:31,650 --> 01:18:34,930
becoming surprisingly enough more I mean
a lot of people are interested in

4040
01:18:34,930 --> 01:18:34,940
a lot of people are interested in
 

4041
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:37,100
a lot of people are interested in
physics in a way that like without

4042
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:37,110
physics in a way that like without
 

4043
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:41,080
physics in a way that like without
understanding it just kind of watching

4044
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:41,090
understanding it just kind of watching
 

4045
01:18:41,090 --> 01:18:43,310
understanding it just kind of watching
scientists a very small number of them

4046
01:18:43,310 --> 01:18:43,320
scientists a very small number of them
 

4047
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:45,500

4048
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:45,510
struggle to understand the nature of our
 

4049
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:47,330
struggle to understand the nature of our
reality right mean I I mean I I think

4050
01:18:47,330 --> 01:18:47,340
reality right mean I I mean I I think
 

4051
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:49,160
reality right mean I I mean I I think
that's somewhat true and in fact in this

4052
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:49,170
that's somewhat true and in fact in this
 

4053
01:18:49,170 --> 01:18:52,189
that's somewhat true and in fact in this
project that I'm launching into to try

01:18:52,189 --> 01:18:52,199
project that I'm launching into to try
 

4055
01:18:52,199 --> 01:18:53,509
project that I'm launching into to try
and find in fundamental theory of

01:18:53,509 --> 01:18:53,519
and find in fundamental theory of
 

4057
01:18:53,519 --> 01:18:55,310
and find in fundamental theory of
physics I'm going to do it as a very

4058
01:18:55,310 --> 01:18:55,320
physics I'm going to do it as a very
 

4059
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:57,049
physics I'm going to do it as a very
public project I mean it's gonna be live

4060
01:18:57,049 --> 01:18:57,059
public project I mean it's gonna be live
 

4061
01:18:57,059 --> 01:18:59,120
public project I mean it's gonna be live
streamed and all this kind of stuff and

4062
01:18:59,120 --> 01:18:59,130
streamed and all this kind of stuff and
 

4063
01:18:59,130 --> 01:19:00,470
streamed and all this kind of stuff and
I don't know what will happen it'll be

4064
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:00,480
I don't know what will happen it'll be
 

4065
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:03,470
I don't know what will happen it'll be
kind of fun I mean I think that it's the

4066
01:19:03,470 --> 01:19:03,480
kind of fun I mean I think that it's the
 

4067
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:06,770
kind of fun I mean I think that it's the
interface to the world of this project I

4068
01:19:06,770 --> 01:19:06,780
interface to the world of this project I
 

4069
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:09,560
interface to the world of this project I
mean I I figure one feature of this

4070
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:09,570
mean I I figure one feature of this
 

4071
01:19:09,570 --> 01:19:12,620
mean I I figure one feature of this
project is you know unlike technology

4072
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:12,630
project is you know unlike technology
 

4073
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:14,419
project is you know unlike technology
projects that basically are what they

4074
01:19:14,419 --> 01:19:14,429
projects that basically are what they
 

4075
01:19:14,429 --> 01:19:16,370
projects that basically are what they
are this is a project that might simply

4076
01:19:16,370 --> 01:19:16,380
are this is a project that might simply
 

4077
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:17,899
are this is a project that might simply
fail because it might be the case that

4078
01:19:17,899 --> 01:19:17,909
fail because it might be the case that
 

4079
01:19:17,909 --> 01:19:19,279
fail because it might be the case that
generates all kinds of elegant

4080
01:19:19,279 --> 01:19:19,289
generates all kinds of elegant
 

4081
01:19:19,289 --> 01:19:21,080
generates all kinds of elegant
mathematics that has absolutely nothing

4082
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:21,090
mathematics that has absolutely nothing
 

4083
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:22,640
mathematics that has absolutely nothing
to do with the physical universe that we

4084
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:22,650
to do with the physical universe that we
 

4085
01:19:22,650 --> 01:19:24,919
to do with the physical universe that we
happen to live in well okay so we're

4086
01:19:24,919 --> 01:19:24,929
happen to live in well okay so we're
 

4087
01:19:24,929 --> 01:19:27,859
happen to live in well okay so we're
talking about kind of the quest to find

4088
01:19:27,859 --> 01:19:27,869
talking about kind of the quest to find
 

4089
01:19:27,869 --> 01:19:30,229
talking about kind of the quest to find
the fundamental theory physics first

4090
01:19:30,229 --> 01:19:30,239
the fundamental theory physics first
 

4091
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:33,080
the fundamental theory physics first
point is you know it's turned out it's

4092
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:33,090
point is you know it's turned out it's
 

4093
01:19:33,090 --> 01:19:34,220
point is you know it's turned out it's
kind of hard to find the fundamental

4094
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:34,230
kind of hard to find the fundamental
 

4095
01:19:34,230 --> 01:19:35,990
kind of hard to find the fundamental
theory physics people weren't sure that

4096
01:19:35,990 --> 01:19:36,000
theory physics people weren't sure that
 

4097
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,569
theory physics people weren't sure that
that would be the case back in the early

4098
01:19:38,569 --> 01:19:38,579
that would be the case back in the early
 

4099
01:19:38,579 --> 01:19:41,410
that would be the case back in the early
days of applying mathematics to science

4100
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:41,420
days of applying mathematics to science
 

4101
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:44,419
days of applying mathematics to science
1600s and so on people were like oh and

4102
01:19:44,419 --> 01:19:44,429
1600s and so on people were like oh and
 

4103
01:19:44,429 --> 01:19:45,589
1600s and so on people were like oh and
a hundred years we'll know everything

4104
01:19:45,589 --> 01:19:45,599
a hundred years we'll know everything
 

4105
01:19:45,599 --> 01:19:47,569
a hundred years we'll know everything
there is to know about how the universe

4106
01:19:47,569 --> 01:19:47,579
there is to know about how the universe
 

4107
01:19:47,579 --> 01:19:49,069
there is to know about how the universe
works turned out to be harder than that

4108
01:19:49,069 --> 01:19:49,079
works turned out to be harder than that
 

4109
01:19:49,079 --> 01:19:51,200
works turned out to be harder than that
and people got kind of humble at some

4110
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:51,210
and people got kind of humble at some
 

4111
01:19:51,210 --> 01:19:52,850
and people got kind of humble at some
level because every time we got to a

4112
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:52,860
level because every time we got to a
 

4113
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:55,040
level because every time we got to a
sort of a greater level of smallness and

4114
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:55,050
sort of a greater level of smallness and
 

4115
01:19:55,050 --> 01:19:57,379
sort of a greater level of smallness and
universe it seemed like the math got

4116
01:19:57,379 --> 01:19:57,389
universe it seemed like the math got
 

4117
01:19:57,389 --> 01:19:59,180
universe it seemed like the math got
more complicated and everything got got

4118
01:19:59,180 --> 01:19:59,190
more complicated and everything got got
 

4119
01:19:59,190 --> 01:20:03,830
more complicated and everything got got
harder the you know when I when I was a

4120
01:20:03,830 --> 01:20:03,840
harder the you know when I when I was a
 

4121
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,899
harder the you know when I when I was a
kid basically I started doing particle

4122
01:20:05,899 --> 01:20:05,909
kid basically I started doing particle
 

4123
01:20:05,909 --> 01:20:08,419
kid basically I started doing particle
physics and you know what I was doing

4124
01:20:08,419 --> 01:20:08,429
physics and you know what I was doing
 

4125
01:20:08,429 --> 01:20:09,410
physics and you know what I was doing
particle physics

4126
01:20:09,410 --> 01:20:09,420
particle physics
 

4127
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:12,350
particle physics
I always thought finding the fundamental

4128
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:12,360
I always thought finding the fundamental
 

4129
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:14,450
I always thought finding the fundamental
fundamental theory of physics that's a

4130
01:20:14,450 --> 01:20:14,460
fundamental theory of physics that's a
 

4131
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:15,979
fundamental theory of physics that's a
kooky business we'll never be able to do

4132
01:20:15,979 --> 01:20:15,989
kooky business we'll never be able to do
 

4133
01:20:15,989 --> 01:20:18,740
kooky business we'll never be able to do
that um but we can operate within these

4134
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:18,750
that um but we can operate within these
 

4135
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:20,569
that um but we can operate within these
frameworks that we built for doing

4136
01:20:20,569 --> 01:20:20,579
frameworks that we built for doing
 

4137
01:20:20,579 --> 01:20:21,890
frameworks that we built for doing
quantum field theory and general

4138
01:20:21,890 --> 01:20:21,900
quantum field theory and general
 

4139
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:23,750
quantum field theory and general
relativity and things like this and it's

4140
01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:23,760
relativity and things like this and it's
 

4141
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,040
relativity and things like this and it's
all good and we can figure out a lot of

4142
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:25,050
all good and we can figure out a lot of
 

4143
01:20:25,050 --> 01:20:27,770
all good and we can figure out a lot of
stuff did you even at that time have a

4144
01:20:27,770 --> 01:20:27,780
stuff did you even at that time have a
 

4145
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:29,709
stuff did you even at that time have a
sense that there's something behind that

4146
01:20:29,709 --> 01:20:29,719
sense that there's something behind that
 

4147
01:20:29,719 --> 01:20:32,839
sense that there's something behind that
sure I just didn't expect that I thought

4148
01:20:32,839 --> 01:20:32,849
sure I just didn't expect that I thought
 

4149
01:20:32,849 --> 01:20:36,589
sure I just didn't expect that I thought
in some rather on it's actually kind of

4150
01:20:36,589 --> 01:20:36,599
in some rather on it's actually kind of
 

4151
01:20:36,599 --> 01:20:38,720
in some rather on it's actually kind of
crazy and thinking back on it because

4152
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:38,730
crazy and thinking back on it because
 

4153
01:20:38,730 --> 01:20:41,149
crazy and thinking back on it because
it's kind of like there was this long

4154
01:20:41,149 --> 01:20:41,159
it's kind of like there was this long
 

4155
01:20:41,159 --> 01:20:42,620
it's kind of like there was this long
period in civilization where people

4156
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:42,630
period in civilization where people
 

4157
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:43,910
period in civilization where people
thought the ancients had it all figured

4158
01:20:43,910 --> 01:20:43,920
thought the ancients had it all figured
 

4159
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:44,990
thought the ancients had it all figured
out and we'll never figure out oh

4160
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:45,000
out and we'll never figure out oh
 

4161
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,780
out and we'll never figure out oh
nothing new and to some extent that's

4162
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:47,790
nothing new and to some extent that's
 

4163
01:20:47,790 --> 01:20:49,910
nothing new and to some extent that's
the way I felt about physics when I was

4164
01:20:49,910 --> 01:20:49,920
the way I felt about physics when I was
 

4165
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,379
the way I felt about physics when I was
in the middle of doing it so to speak

4166
01:20:51,379 --> 01:20:51,389
in the middle of doing it so to speak
 

4167
01:20:51,389 --> 01:20:54,290
in the middle of doing it so to speak
and was you know we've got quantum field

4168
01:20:54,290 --> 01:20:54,300
and was you know we've got quantum field
 

4169
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:55,729
and was you know we've got quantum field
theory it's the foundation of what we're

4170
01:20:55,729 --> 01:20:55,739
theory it's the foundation of what we're
 

4171
01:20:55,739 --> 01:20:58,490
theory it's the foundation of what we're
doing and there's you know yes there's

4172
01:20:58,490 --> 01:20:58,500
doing and there's you know yes there's
 

4173
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:00,080
doing and there's you know yes there's
probably something underneath this but

4174
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:00,090
probably something underneath this but
 

4175
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:02,780
probably something underneath this but
we'll sort of never figure it out but

4176
01:21:02,780 --> 01:21:02,790
we'll sort of never figure it out but
 

4177
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:05,750
we'll sort of never figure it out but
then I started studying simple programs

4178
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:05,760
then I started studying simple programs
 

4179
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,910
then I started studying simple programs
and the computational universe things

4180
01:21:07,910 --> 01:21:07,920
and the computational universe things
 

4181
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:10,160
and the computational universe things
like solar automata and so on and I

4182
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:10,170
like solar automata and so on and I
 

4183
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:12,620
like solar automata and so on and I
discovered that there so they do all

4184
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:12,630
discovered that there so they do all
 

4185
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:14,780
discovered that there so they do all
kinds of things that were completely at

4186
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:14,790
kinds of things that were completely at
 

4187
01:21:14,790 --> 01:21:16,370
kinds of things that were completely at
odds with the intuition that I had had

4188
01:21:16,370 --> 01:21:16,380
odds with the intuition that I had had
 

4189
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:19,310
odds with the intuition that I had had
and so after that after you see this

4190
01:21:19,310 --> 01:21:19,320
and so after that after you see this
 

4191
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,379
and so after that after you see this
tiny little program that does all this

4192
01:21:21,379 --> 01:21:21,389
tiny little program that does all this
 

4193
01:21:21,389 --> 01:21:23,600
tiny little program that does all this
amazingly complicated stuff then you

4194
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:23,610
amazingly complicated stuff then you
 

4195
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:25,370
amazingly complicated stuff then you
start feeling a bit more ambitious about

4196
01:21:25,370 --> 01:21:25,380
start feeling a bit more ambitious about
 

4197
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:27,350
start feeling a bit more ambitious about
physics and saying maybe we could do

4198
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:27,360
physics and saying maybe we could do
 

4199
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:30,049
physics and saying maybe we could do
this for physics too and so that's some

4200
01:21:30,049 --> 01:21:30,059
this for physics too and so that's some
 

4201
01:21:30,059 --> 01:21:32,839
this for physics too and so that's some
that got me started years ago now and

4202
01:21:32,839 --> 01:21:32,849
that got me started years ago now and
 

4203
01:21:32,849 --> 01:21:36,129
that got me started years ago now and
this kind of idea of could we actually

4204
01:21:36,129 --> 01:21:36,139
this kind of idea of could we actually
 

4205
01:21:36,139 --> 01:21:38,899
this kind of idea of could we actually
find what's underneath all of these

4206
01:21:38,899 --> 01:21:38,909
find what's underneath all of these
 

4207
01:21:38,909 --> 01:21:40,370
find what's underneath all of these
frameworks like one a field theory in

4208
01:21:40,370 --> 01:21:40,380
frameworks like one a field theory in
 

4209
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:41,839
frameworks like one a field theory in

jorts everything's on and people perhaps
don't realize as slow as they might that

4212
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:44,760
don't realize as slow as they might that
 

4213
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:46,339
don't realize as slow as they might that
you know the frameworks we're using for

4214
01:21:46,339 --> 01:21:46,349
you know the frameworks we're using for
 

4215
01:21:46,349 --> 01:21:47,479
you know the frameworks we're using for
physics which is basically these two

4216
01:21:47,479 --> 01:21:47,489
physics which is basically these two
 

4217
01:21:47,489 --> 01:21:50,899
physics which is basically these two
things quantum field theory the sort of

4218
01:21:50,899 --> 01:21:50,909
things quantum field theory the sort of
 

4219
01:21:50,909 --> 01:21:52,970
things quantum field theory the sort of
the theory of small stuff and general

4220
01:21:52,970 --> 01:21:52,980
the theory of small stuff and general
 

4221
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:54,890
the theory of small stuff and general
relativity theory of gravitation and

4222
01:21:54,890 --> 01:21:54,900
relativity theory of gravitation and
 

4223
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:56,479
relativity theory of gravitation and
large stuff those are the two basic

4224
01:21:56,479 --> 01:21:56,489
large stuff those are the two basic
 

4225
01:21:56,489 --> 01:21:58,700
large stuff those are the two basic
theories and they're 100 years old I

4226
01:21:58,700 --> 01:21:58,710
theories and they're 100 years old I
 

4227
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:01,640
theories and they're 100 years old I
mean general relativity was 1915 quantum

4228
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:01,650
mean general relativity was 1915 quantum
 

4229
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:04,790
mean general relativity was 1915 quantum
field theory well 1920s I'm basically a

4230
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:04,800
field theory well 1920s I'm basically a
 

4231
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:05,569
field theory well 1920s I'm basically a
hundred years old

4232
01:22:05,569 --> 01:22:05,579
hundred years old
 

4233
01:22:05,579 --> 01:22:08,720
hundred years old
and they've they've it's been a good run

4234
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:08,730
and they've they've it's been a good run
 

4235
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:10,100
and they've they've it's been a good run
there's a lot of stuff been figured out

4236
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:10,110
there's a lot of stuff been figured out
 

4237
01:22:10,110 --> 01:22:13,520
there's a lot of stuff been figured out
but what's interesting is the

4238
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:13,530
but what's interesting is the
 

4239
01:22:13,530 --> 01:22:15,080
but what's interesting is the
foundations haven't changed in all that

4240
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:15,090
foundations haven't changed in all that
 

4241
01:22:15,090 --> 01:22:16,850
foundations haven't changed in all that
period of time even though the

4242
01:22:16,850 --> 01:22:16,860
period of time even though the
 

4243
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:18,470
period of time even though the
foundations had changed several times

4244
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:18,480
foundations had changed several times
 

4245
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,420
foundations had changed several times
before that in the two hundred years

4246
01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:20,430
before that in the two hundred years
 

4247
01:22:20,430 --> 01:22:23,930
before that in the two hundred years
earlier than that um and I think the

4248
01:22:23,930 --> 01:22:23,940
earlier than that um and I think the
 

4249
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:25,130
earlier than that um and I think the
kinds of things that I'm thinking about

4250
01:22:25,130 --> 01:22:25,140
kinds of things that I'm thinking about
 

4251
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:26,870
kinds of things that I'm thinking about
which is sort of really informed by

4252
01:22:26,870 --> 01:22:26,880
which is sort of really informed by
 

4253
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,400
which is sort of really informed by
thinking about computation in the

4254
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:28,410
thinking about computation in the
 

4255
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:30,650
thinking about computation in the
computational universe it's a different

4256
01:22:30,650 --> 01:22:30,660
computational universe it's a different
 

4257
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:32,150
computational universe it's a different
foundation it's a different set of

4258
01:22:32,150 --> 01:22:32,160
foundation it's a different set of
 

4259
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:36,410
foundation it's a different set of
foundations and might be wrong but it is

4260
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:36,420
foundations and might be wrong but it is
 

4261
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:38,960
foundations and might be wrong but it is
at least you know we have a shot and I

4262
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:38,970
at least you know we have a shot and I
 

4263
01:22:38,970 --> 01:22:41,540
at least you know we have a shot and I
think it's you know to me it's you know

4264
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:41,550
think it's you know to me it's you know
 

4265
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:45,160
think it's you know to me it's you know
my personal calculation for myself is is

4266
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:45,170
my personal calculation for myself is is
 

4267
01:22:45,170 --> 01:22:48,229
my personal calculation for myself is is
you know if it turns out that the

4268
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:48,239
you know if it turns out that the
 

4269
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:49,670
you know if it turns out that the
finding the fundamental theory of

4270
01:22:49,670 --> 01:22:49,680
finding the fundamental theory of
 

4271
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:51,290
finding the fundamental theory of
physics it's kind of low-hanging fruit

4272
01:22:51,290 --> 01:22:51,300
physics it's kind of low-hanging fruit
 

4273
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,220
physics it's kind of low-hanging fruit
so to speak

4274
01:22:52,220 --> 01:22:52,230
so to speak
 

4275
01:22:52,230 --> 01:22:54,410
so to speak
it'd be a shame if we just didn't think

4276
01:22:54,410 --> 01:22:54,420
it'd be a shame if we just didn't think
 

4277
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:56,630
it'd be a shame if we just didn't think
to do it you know if people just said oh

4278
01:22:56,630 --> 01:22:56,640
to do it you know if people just said oh
 

4279
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,790
to do it you know if people just said oh
you'll never figure that stuff out let's

4280
01:22:58,790 --> 01:22:58,800
you'll never figure that stuff out let's
 

4281
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,800
you'll never figure that stuff out let's
you know and it takes another two

4282
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:00,810
you know and it takes another two
 

4283
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:02,870
you know and it takes another two
hundred years before anybody gets around

4284
01:23:02,870 --> 01:23:02,880
hundred years before anybody gets around
 

4285
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:06,530
hundred years before anybody gets around
to doing it um you know I think it's I

4286
01:23:06,530 --> 01:23:06,540
to doing it um you know I think it's I
 

4287
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:08,930
to doing it um you know I think it's I
don't know how low-hanging this fruit

4288
01:23:08,930 --> 01:23:08,940
don't know how low-hanging this fruit
 

4289
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:11,240
don't know how low-hanging this fruit
actually is it may be you know it may be

4290
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:11,250
actually is it may be you know it may be
 

4291
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:13,970
actually is it may be you know it may be
that it's kind of the wrong century to

4292
01:23:13,970 --> 01:23:13,980
that it's kind of the wrong century to
 

4293
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:16,550
that it's kind of the wrong century to
do this project I mean I think the the

4294
01:23:16,550 --> 01:23:16,560
do this project I mean I think the the
 

4295
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,530
do this project I mean I think the the
the cautionary tale for me you know I

4296
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:18,540
the cautionary tale for me you know I
 

4297
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:20,180
the cautionary tale for me you know I
think about things that I've tried to do

4298
01:23:20,180 --> 01:23:20,190
think about things that I've tried to do
 

4299
01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:23,120
think about things that I've tried to do
in technology where people thought about

4300
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:23,130
in technology where people thought about
 

4301
01:23:23,130 --> 01:23:26,180
in technology where people thought about
doing them a lot earlier and my favorite

4302
01:23:26,180 --> 01:23:26,190
doing them a lot earlier and my favorite
 

4303
01:23:26,190 --> 01:23:28,340
doing them a lot earlier and my favorite
example is probably live Nets who-who

4304
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:28,350
example is probably live Nets who-who
 

4305
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:30,400
example is probably live Nets who-who
thought about making essentially

4306
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:30,410
thought about making essentially
 

4307
01:23:30,410 --> 01:23:32,390
thought about making essentially
encapsulating the world's knowledge in a

4308
01:23:32,390 --> 01:23:32,400
encapsulating the world's knowledge in a
 

4309
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:35,920
encapsulating the world's knowledge in a
computational form in the late 1600s and

4310
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:35,930
computational form in the late 1600s and
 

4311
01:23:35,930 --> 01:23:38,380
computational form in the late 1600s and
did a lot of things towards that and

4312
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:38,390
did a lot of things towards that and
 

4313
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:40,760
did a lot of things towards that and
basically you know we finally managed to

4314
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:40,770
basically you know we finally managed to
 

4315
01:23:40,770 --> 01:23:42,770
basically you know we finally managed to
do this but he was three hundred years

4316
01:23:42,770 --> 01:23:42,780
do this but he was three hundred years
 

4317
01:23:42,780 --> 01:23:44,870
do this but he was three hundred years
too early and that's the that's kind of

4318
01:23:44,870 --> 01:23:44,880
too early and that's the that's kind of
 

4319
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,479
too early and that's the that's kind of
the in terms of life planning it's kind

4320
01:23:47,479 --> 01:23:47,489
the in terms of life planning it's kind
 

4321
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:49,460
the in terms of life planning it's kind
of like avoid things that can't be done

4322
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:49,470
of like avoid things that can't be done
 

4323
01:23:49,470 --> 01:23:52,250
of like avoid things that can't be done
in your in your century so to speak yeah

4324
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:52,260
in your in your century so to speak yeah
 

4325
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:55,460
in your in your century so to speak yeah
timing timing is everything you so you

4326
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:55,470
timing timing is everything you so you
 

4327
01:23:55,470 --> 01:23:59,020
timing timing is everything you so you
think if we kind of figure out the

4328
01:23:59,020 --> 01:23:59,030
think if we kind of figure out the
 

4329
01:23:59,030 --> 01:24:02,600
think if we kind of figure out the
underlying rules that can create from

4330
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:02,610
underlying rules that can create from
 

4331
01:24:02,610 --> 01:24:04,490
underlying rules that can create from
which quantum field theory in general

4332
01:24:04,490 --> 01:24:04,500
which quantum field theory in general
 

4333
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:06,890
which quantum field theory in general
relativity can emerge do you think

4334
01:24:06,890 --> 01:24:06,900
relativity can emerge do you think
 

4335
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:08,510
relativity can emerge do you think
they'll help us unify it at that level

4336
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:08,520
they'll help us unify it at that level
 

4337
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:10,580
they'll help us unify it at that level
of track we'll know it completely we'll

4338
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:10,590
of track we'll know it completely we'll
 

4339
01:24:10,590 --> 01:24:11,960
of track we'll know it completely we'll
know how that all fits together

4340
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:11,970
know how that all fits together
 

4341
01:24:11,970 --> 01:24:14,930
know how that all fits together
yes without a question and I mean it's

4342
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:14,940
yes without a question and I mean it's
 

4343
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:17,540
yes without a question and I mean it's
already even the things I've already

4344
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:17,550
already even the things I've already
 

4345
01:24:17,550 --> 01:24:21,440
already even the things I've already
done they're a very you know it's very

4346
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:21,450
done they're a very you know it's very
 

4347
01:24:21,450 --> 01:24:22,830
done they're a very you know it's very
very elegant actual

4348
01:24:22,830 --> 01:24:22,840
very elegant actual
 

4349
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,750
very elegant actual
how things seem to be fitting together

4350
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:24,760
how things seem to be fitting together
 

4351
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:26,430
how things seem to be fitting together
now you know is it right I don't know

4352
01:24:26,430 --> 01:24:26,440
now you know is it right I don't know
 

4353
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:29,790
now you know is it right I don't know
yet it's awfully suggestive if it isn't

4354
01:24:29,790 --> 01:24:29,800
yet it's awfully suggestive if it isn't
 

4355
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:33,359
yet it's awfully suggestive if it isn't
right it's some then the designer of the

right it's some then the designer of the
 

4357
01:24:33,369 --> 01:24:34,830
right it's some then the designer of the
universe should feel embarrassed so to

4358
01:24:34,830 --> 01:24:34,840
universe should feel embarrassed so to
 

4359
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:36,060
universe should feel embarrassed so to
speak because it's a really good way to

4360
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:36,070
speak because it's a really good way to
 

4361
01:24:36,070 --> 01:24:38,729
speak because it's a really good way to
do that in your intuition in terms of

01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:44,010
design universe does God play dice is
there is there randomness in this thing

4366
01:24:44,010 --> 01:24:44,020
there is there randomness in this thing
 

4367
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:46,979
there is there randomness in this thing
or is it deterministic so the kind of

4368
01:24:46,979 --> 01:24:46,989
or is it deterministic so the kind of
 

4369
01:24:46,989 --> 01:24:48,089
or is it deterministic so the kind of
guy that's a little bit of a complicated

01:24:48,089 --> 01:24:48,099
guy that's a little bit of a complicated
 

4371
01:24:48,099 --> 01:24:50,370
guy that's a little bit of a complicated
question because when you're dealing

4372
01:24:50,370 --> 01:24:50,380
question because when you're dealing
 

4373
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:51,990
question because when you're dealing
with these things that involve these

4374
01:24:51,990 --> 01:24:52,000
with these things that involve these
 

4375
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,540
with these things that involve these
rewrites that have okay even randomness

4376
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:54,550
rewrites that have okay even randomness
 

4377
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:57,390
rewrites that have okay even randomness
is an emergent phenomenon perhaps yes I

4378
01:24:57,390 --> 01:24:57,400
is an emergent phenomenon perhaps yes I
 

4379
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,700
is an emergent phenomenon perhaps yes I
mean it's a yeah well randomness in in

4380
01:24:59,700 --> 01:24:59,710
mean it's a yeah well randomness in in
 

4381
01:24:59,710 --> 01:25:02,070
mean it's a yeah well randomness in in
many of these systems pseudo randomness

4382
01:25:02,070 --> 01:25:02,080
many of these systems pseudo randomness
 

4383
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,750
many of these systems pseudo randomness
and randomness are hard to distinguish

4384
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:03,760
and randomness are hard to distinguish
 

4385
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,750
and randomness are hard to distinguish
um in this particular case the current

4386
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:06,760
um in this particular case the current
 

4387
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:09,720
um in this particular case the current
idea that we have about some measurement

4388
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:09,730
idea that we have about some measurement
 

4389
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:13,320
idea that we have about some measurement
in quantum mechanics is something very

4390
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:13,330
in quantum mechanics is something very
 

4391
01:25:13,330 --> 01:25:15,570
in quantum mechanics is something very
bizarre and very abstract and I don't

4392
01:25:15,570 --> 01:25:15,580
bizarre and very abstract and I don't
 

4393
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:18,930
bizarre and very abstract and I don't
think I can yet explain it without kind

4394
01:25:18,930 --> 01:25:18,940
think I can yet explain it without kind
 

4395
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:21,120
think I can yet explain it without kind
of yakking about very technical things

4396
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:21,130
of yakking about very technical things
 

4397
01:25:21,130 --> 01:25:23,729
of yakking about very technical things
eventually I will be able to but if

4398
01:25:23,729 --> 01:25:23,739
eventually I will be able to but if
 

4399
01:25:23,739 --> 01:25:26,640
eventually I will be able to but if
that's if that's right it's kind of a

4400
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:26,650
that's if that's right it's kind of a
 

4401
01:25:26,650 --> 01:25:28,709
that's if that's right it's kind of a
it's a weird thing because it slices

4402
01:25:28,709 --> 01:25:28,719
it's a weird thing because it slices
 

4403
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:32,459
it's a weird thing because it slices
between determinism and randomness in a

4404
01:25:32,459 --> 01:25:32,469
between determinism and randomness in a
 

4405
01:25:32,469 --> 01:25:34,379
between determinism and randomness in a
weird way that hasn't been sliced before

4406
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:34,389
weird way that hasn't been sliced before
 

4407
01:25:34,389 --> 01:25:36,060
weird way that hasn't been sliced before
so to speak so like many of these

4408
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:36,070
so to speak so like many of these
 

4409
01:25:36,070 --> 01:25:38,310
so to speak so like many of these
questions that come up in science where

4410
01:25:38,310 --> 01:25:38,320
questions that come up in science where
 

4411
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:39,919
questions that come up in science where
it's like is that this or is it that

4412
01:25:39,919 --> 01:25:39,929
it's like is that this or is it that
 

4413
01:25:39,929 --> 01:25:42,149
it's like is that this or is it that
turns out the real answer is it's

4414
01:25:42,149 --> 01:25:42,159
turns out the real answer is it's
 

4415
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:43,500
turns out the real answer is it's
neither of those things it's something

4416
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:43,510
neither of those things it's something
 

4417
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:45,839
neither of those things it's something
kind of different and sort of orthogonal

4418
01:25:45,839 --> 01:25:45,849
kind of different and sort of orthogonal
 

4419
01:25:45,849 --> 01:25:49,169
kind of different and sort of orthogonal
to those those those categories and so

4420
01:25:49,169 --> 01:25:49,179
to those those those categories and so
 

4421
01:25:49,179 --> 01:25:51,479
to those those those categories and so
that's the current you know this week's

4422
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:51,489
that's the current you know this week's
 

4423
01:25:51,489 --> 01:25:54,300
that's the current you know this week's
idea about how that might work um but

4424
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:54,310
idea about how that might work um but
 

4425
01:25:54,310 --> 01:25:57,350
idea about how that might work um but
you know we'll we'll see how that term

4426
01:25:57,350 --> 01:25:57,360
you know we'll we'll see how that term
 

4427
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,550
you know we'll we'll see how that term
unfolds I mean there's there's this

4428
01:25:59,550 --> 01:25:59,560
unfolds I mean there's there's this
 

4429
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:02,100
unfolds I mean there's there's this
question about a field like physics and

4430
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:02,110
question about a field like physics and
 

4431
01:26:02,110 --> 01:26:03,629
question about a field like physics and
sort of the quest for a fundamental

4432
01:26:03,629 --> 01:26:03,639
sort of the quest for a fundamental
 

4433
01:26:03,639 --> 01:26:06,450
sort of the quest for a fundamental
theory and so on and there's both the

4434
01:26:06,450 --> 01:26:06,460
theory and so on and there's both the
 

4435
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:08,760
theory and so on and there's both the
science of what happens and there's the

4436
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:08,770
science of what happens and there's the
 

4437
01:26:08,770 --> 01:26:10,830
science of what happens and there's the
the sort of the social aspect of what

4438
01:26:10,830 --> 01:26:10,840
the sort of the social aspect of what
 

4439
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:13,470
the sort of the social aspect of what
happens because you know in a field that

4440
01:26:13,470 --> 01:26:13,480
happens because you know in a field that
 

4441
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:16,890
happens because you know in a field that
is basically as old as physics we're at

4442
01:26:16,890 --> 01:26:16,900
is basically as old as physics we're at
 

4443
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:18,300
is basically as old as physics we're at
I don't know what it is fourth

4444
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:18,310
I don't know what it is fourth
 

4445
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:19,470
I don't know what it is fourth
generation I don't know fourth

4446
01:26:19,470 --> 01:26:19,480
generation I don't know fourth
 

4447
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:20,609
generation I don't know fourth
generation I don't know what generation

4448
01:26:20,609 --> 01:26:20,619
generation I don't know what generation
 

4449
01:26:20,619 --> 01:26:23,550
generation I don't know what generation
it is of physicists and like I was one

4450
01:26:23,550 --> 01:26:23,560
it is of physicists and like I was one
 

4451
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:25,830
it is of physicists and like I was one
of these so to speak and for me the

4452
01:26:25,830 --> 01:26:25,840
of these so to speak and for me the
 

4453
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:28,140
of these so to speak and for me the
foundations were like the pyramids so to

4454
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:28,150
foundations were like the pyramids so to
 

4455
01:26:28,150 --> 01:26:30,060
foundations were like the pyramids so to
speak you know it was that way and it

4456
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:30,070
speak you know it was that way and it
 

4457
01:26:30,070 --> 01:26:30,839
speak you know it was that way and it
was always that way

4458
01:26:30,839 --> 01:26:30,849
was always that way
 

4459
01:26:30,849 --> 01:26:34,919
was always that way
um it is difficult in an old field to go

4460
01:26:34,919 --> 01:26:34,929
um it is difficult in an old field to go
 

4461
01:26:34,929 --> 01:26:36,490
um it is difficult in an old field to go
back to the foundations and would think

4462
01:26:36,490 --> 01:26:36,500
back to the foundations and would think
 

4463
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:38,620
back to the foundations and would think
about rewriting them it's a lot easier

4464
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:38,630
about rewriting them it's a lot easier
 

4465
01:26:38,630 --> 01:26:40,810
about rewriting them it's a lot easier
in young fields where you're still

4466
01:26:40,810 --> 01:26:40,820
in young fields where you're still
 

4467
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:42,430
in young fields where you're still
dealing with the first generation of

4468
01:26:42,430 --> 01:26:42,440
dealing with the first generation of
 

4469
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:45,280
dealing with the first generation of
people who invented the field and it

4470
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:45,290
people who invented the field and it
 

4471
01:26:45,290 --> 01:26:46,810
people who invented the field and it
tends to be the case you know that the

4472
01:26:46,810 --> 01:26:46,820
tends to be the case you know that the
 

4473
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:48,820
tends to be the case you know that the
nature of what happens in science tends

4474
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:48,830
nature of what happens in science tends
 

4475
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:51,100
nature of what happens in science tends
to be you know you'll get there

4476
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:51,110
to be you know you'll get there
 

4477
01:26:51,110 --> 01:26:53,200
to be you know you'll get there
typically the pattern is some

4478
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:53,210
typically the pattern is some
 

4479
01:26:53,210 --> 01:26:55,720
typically the pattern is some
methodological advanced occurs and then

there's a period of five years ten years

4482

there's a period of five years ten years
 

4483
01:26:57,470 --> 01:26:58,690
there's a period of five years ten years
maybe a little bit longer than that

methodological advance whether it's you
know I don't know telescopes or whether

01:27:07,090 --> 01:27:07,100
know I don't know telescopes or whether
 

4493
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:08,710

4507
01:27:25,130 --> 01:27:27,160
certain amount of time after that all
that low-hanging fruit is picked then

that low-hanging fruit is picked then
 

4509
01:27:27,170 --> 01:27:29,830
that low-hanging fruit is picked then
it's a hard slog for the next however

can do something and it's kind of a a.m.

4516
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:38,030
can do something and it's kind of a a.m.
 

4517
01:27:38,030 --> 01:27:39,670
can do something and it's kind of a a.m.
and it tends to be the case that in

4518
01:27:39,670 --> 01:27:39,680
and it tends to be the case that in
 

4519
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:41,440
and it tends to be the case that in
fields that are in that kind of but I

4520
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:41,450
fields that are in that kind of but I
 

4521
01:27:41,450 --> 01:27:42,880
fields that are in that kind of but I
wouldn't say cruise mode because it's

4522
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:42,890
wouldn't say cruise mode because it's
 

4523
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:45,250
wouldn't say cruise mode because it's
really hard work but it's very hard work

4524
01:27:45,250 --> 01:27:45,260
really hard work but it's very hard work
 

4525
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:46,900
really hard work but it's very hard work
for very incremental progress

4526
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:46,910
for very incremental progress
 

4527
01:27:46,910 --> 01:27:49,870
for very incremental progress
um and the in your career and some of

4528
01:27:49,870 --> 01:27:49,880
um and the in your career and some of
 

4529
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:51,550
um and the in your career and some of
the things you've taken on it feels like

4530
01:27:51,550 --> 01:27:51,560
the things you've taken on it feels like
 

4531
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:53,320
the things you've taken on it feels like
you're not you haven't been afraid of

4532
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:53,330
you're not you haven't been afraid of
 

4533
01:27:53,330 --> 01:27:57,160
you're not you haven't been afraid of
the hard slog the also true so it's

4534
01:27:57,160 --> 01:27:57,170
the hard slog the also true so it's
 

4535
01:27:57,170 --> 01:27:59,170
the hard slog the also true so it's
quite interesting especially on the

4536
01:27:59,170 --> 01:27:59,180
quite interesting especially on the
 

4537
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:01,270
quite interesting especially on the
engineering on the engineering side and

4538
01:28:01,270 --> 01:28:01,280
engineering on the engineering side and
 

4539
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:04,630
engineering on the engineering side and

we were both consultants at this company

4554
01:28:20,710 --> 01:28:20,720
we were both consultants at this company
 

4555
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:21,610
we were both consultants at this company
called Thinking Machines Corporation

01:28:23,530 --> 01:28:23,540
which was just down the street from here

actually um ultimately ill-fated company

4560
01:28:26,710 --> 01:28:26,720
actually um ultimately ill-fated company
 

4561
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:29,320
actually um ultimately ill-fated company
but um I used to say this company is not

4562
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:29,330
but um I used to say this company is not
 

4563
01:28:29,330 --> 01:28:31,060
but um I used to say this company is not
going to work with the strategy they

4564
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:31,070
going to work with the strategy they
 

4565
01:28:31,070 --> 01:28:32,740
going to work with the strategy they
have and dick Feynman always used to say

4566
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:32,750
have and dick Feynman always used to say
 

4567
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:34,480
have and dick Feynman always used to say
what do we know about running companies

4568
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:34,490
what do we know about running companies
 

4569
01:28:34,490 --> 01:28:36,840
what do we know about running companies
just let them run their company but uh

4570
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:36,850
just let them run their company but uh
 

4571
01:28:36,850 --> 01:28:41,170
just let them run their company but uh
anyway I was there he was not into into

4572
01:28:41,170 --> 01:28:41,180
anyway I was there he was not into into
 

4573
01:28:41,180 --> 01:28:42,580
anyway I was there he was not into into
that kind of thing and he always thought

4574
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:42,590
that kind of thing and he always thought
 

4575
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:44,320
that kind of thing and he always thought
it was thought that my interest in doing

4576
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:44,330
it was thought that my interest in doing
 

4577
01:28:44,330 --> 01:28:46,330
it was thought that my interest in doing
things like running companies was a was

4578
01:28:46,330 --> 01:28:46,340
things like running companies was a was
 

4579
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:49,780
things like running companies was a was
a distraction so to speak um and

4580
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:49,790
a distraction so to speak um and
 

4581
01:28:49,790 --> 01:28:53,500
a distraction so to speak um and
for me it's a it's a mechanism to have a

4582
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:53,510
for me it's a it's a mechanism to have a
 

4583
01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:55,800
for me it's a it's a mechanism to have a
more effective machine for actually

4584
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:55,810
more effective machine for actually
 

4585
01:28:55,810 --> 01:28:58,420
more effective machine for actually
getting things figuring things out and

4586
01:28:58,420 --> 01:28:58,430
getting things figuring things out and
 

4587
01:28:58,430 --> 01:29:00,220
getting things figuring things out and
getting things to happen did he think of

4588
01:29:00,220 --> 01:29:00,230
getting things to happen did he think of
 

4589
01:29:00,230 --> 01:29:02,890
getting things to happen did he think of
it because essentially what you used you

4590
01:29:02,890 --> 01:29:02,900
it because essentially what you used you
 

4591
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:04,000
it because essentially what you used you
did with the company I don't know if you

4592
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:04,010
did with the company I don't know if you
 

4593
01:29:04,010 --> 01:29:05,890
did with the company I don't know if you
were thinking of it that way but you're

4594
01:29:05,890 --> 01:29:05,900
were thinking of it that way but you're
 

4595
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:10,150
were thinking of it that way but you're
creating tools to empower your to

university do you think did he did he

4600
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:15,260
university do you think did he did he
 

4601
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:17,229
university do you think did he did he
understand that point that the point of

4602
01:29:17,229 --> 01:29:17,239
understand that point that the point of
 

4603
01:29:17,239 --> 01:29:20,110
understand that point that the point of
tools of I think not as well as he might

4604
01:29:20,110 --> 01:29:20,120
tools of I think not as well as he might
 

4605
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:22,630
tools of I think not as well as he might
have done I mean I think that but you

4606
01:29:22,630 --> 01:29:22,640
have done I mean I think that but you
 

4607
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:24,790
have done I mean I think that but you
know he was actually my first company

4608
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:24,800
know he was actually my first company
 

4609
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:28,270
know he was actually my first company
which was also involved with well was

4610
01:29:28,270 --> 01:29:28,280
which was also involved with well was
 

4611
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:29,560
which was also involved with well was
involved with more mathematical

4612
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:29,570
involved with more mathematical
 

4613
01:29:29,570 --> 01:29:33,280
involved with more mathematical
computation kinds of things um you know

4614
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:33,290
computation kinds of things um you know
 

4615
01:29:33,290 --> 01:29:35,710
computation kinds of things um you know
he was quite - he had lots of advice

4616
01:29:35,710 --> 01:29:35,720
he was quite - he had lots of advice
 

4617
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:37,300
he was quite - he had lots of advice
about the technical side of what we

4618
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:37,310
about the technical side of what we
 

4619
01:29:37,310 --> 01:29:40,090
about the technical side of what we
should do and so on um giving examples

4620
01:29:40,090 --> 01:29:40,100
should do and so on um giving examples
 

4621
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:41,710
should do and so on um giving examples
and memories of thoughts that oh yeah

4622
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:41,720
and memories of thoughts that oh yeah
 

4623
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:45,100
and memories of thoughts that oh yeah
yeah he had all kinds of lucky in in the

4624
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:45,110
yeah he had all kinds of lucky in in the
 

4625
01:29:45,110 --> 01:29:47,080
yeah he had all kinds of lucky in in the
business of doing sort of you know one

4626
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:47,090
business of doing sort of you know one
 

4627
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:48,280
business of doing sort of you know one
of the hard things in math is doing

4628
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:48,290
of the hard things in math is doing
 

4629
01:29:48,290 --> 01:29:50,320
of the hard things in math is doing
integrals and so on right and so he had

4630
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:50,330
integrals and so on right and so he had
 

4631
01:29:50,330 --> 01:29:53,080
integrals and so on right and so he had
his own elaborate ways to do integrals

4632
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:53,090
his own elaborate ways to do integrals
 

4633
01:29:53,090 --> 01:29:54,250
his own elaborate ways to do integrals
and so on he had his own ways of

4634
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:54,260
and so on he had his own ways of
 

4635
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:56,200
and so on he had his own ways of
thinking about sort of getting intuition

4636
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:56,210
thinking about sort of getting intuition
 

4637
01:29:56,210 --> 01:29:59,890
thinking about sort of getting intuition
about how math works and so his sort of

4638
01:29:59,890 --> 01:29:59,900
about how math works and so his sort of
 

4639
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:02,890
about how math works and so his sort of
meta idea was take those intuitional

4640
01:30:02,890 --> 01:30:02,900
meta idea was take those intuitional
 

4641
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:04,810
meta idea was take those intuitional
methods and make a computer follow those

4642
01:30:04,810 --> 01:30:04,820
methods and make a computer follow those
 

4643
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:07,410
methods and make a computer follow those
in traditional methods now it turns out

4644
01:30:07,410 --> 01:30:07,420
in traditional methods now it turns out
 

4645
01:30:07,420 --> 01:30:09,670
in traditional methods now it turns out
for the most part like when we do

4646
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:09,680
for the most part like when we do
 

4647
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:12,310
for the most part like when we do
integrals and things what we do is is we

4648
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:12,320
integrals and things what we do is is we
 

4649
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,410
integrals and things what we do is is we
build this kind of bizarre industrial

4650
01:30:14,410 --> 01:30:14,420
build this kind of bizarre industrial
 

4651
01:30:14,420 --> 01:30:16,870
build this kind of bizarre industrial
machine that turns every integral until

4652
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:16,880
machine that turns every integral until
 

4653
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:18,700
machine that turns every integral until
you know products of Mayer G functions

4654
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:18,710
you know products of Mayer G functions
 

4655
01:30:18,710 --> 01:30:21,250
you know products of Mayer G functions
and generates this very elaborate thing

4656
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:21,260
and generates this very elaborate thing
 

4657
01:30:21,260 --> 01:30:23,229
and generates this very elaborate thing
and actually the big problem is turning

4658
01:30:23,229 --> 01:30:23,239
and actually the big problem is turning
 

4659
01:30:23,239 --> 01:30:24,670
and actually the big problem is turning
the results into something a human will

4660
01:30:24,670 --> 01:30:24,680
the results into something a human will
 

4661
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:26,950
the results into something a human will
understand it's not quotes doing the

4662
01:30:26,950 --> 01:30:26,960
understand it's not quotes doing the
 

4663
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,990
understand it's not quotes doing the
integral and actually Fineman did

4664
01:30:28,990 --> 01:30:29,000
integral and actually Fineman did
 

4665
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,430
integral and actually Fineman did
understand that to some extent and I I

4666
01:30:30,430 --> 01:30:30,440
understand that to some extent and I I

01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:33,050
am embarrassed to say he once gave me
 

4669
01:30:33,050 --> 01:30:35,620

methods for particle physics that he

4672
01:30:37,330 --> 01:30:37,340
methods for particle physics that he
 

4673
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:38,890
methods for particle physics that he
worked out in the 50s and he said you

4674
01:30:38,890 --> 01:30:38,900
worked out in the 50s and he said you
 

4675
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:39,970
worked out in the 50s and he said you
know it's more used to you than to me

4676
01:30:39,970 --> 01:30:39,980
know it's more used to you than to me
 

4677
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:42,250
know it's more used to you than to me
type thing and I I was like I were

4678
01:30:42,250 --> 01:30:42,260
type thing and I I was like I were
 

4679
01:30:42,260 --> 01:30:43,540

4680
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:43,550
intended to look at it and give it back
 

4681
01:30:43,550 --> 01:30:47,140
intended to look at it and give it back
and I store my files now so it's but

4682
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:47,150
and I store my files now so it's but
 

4683
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:49,210
and I store my files now so it's but
that's what happens when when it's

4684
01:30:49,210 --> 01:30:49,220
that's what happens when when it's
 

4685
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:51,880
that's what happens when when it's
finiteness of human lives it um I hate

4686
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:51,890
finiteness of human lives it um I hate

you know maybe if he'd live another 20

4688
01:30:53,140 --> 01:30:53,150
you know maybe if he'd live another 20
 

4689

years I would have I would remember to

4690
01:30:54,820 --> 01:30:54,830
years I would have I would remember to
 

4691
01:30:54,830 --> 01:30:57,640
years I would have I would remember to
give it back but I think it's you know

4692
01:30:57,640 --> 01:30:57,650
give it back but I think it's you know
 

4693
01:30:57,650 --> 01:31:01,770
give it back but I think it's you know
that that was his attempt to systematize

4694
01:31:01,770 --> 01:31:01,780
that that was his attempt to systematize
 

4695
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:04,240
that that was his attempt to systematize
the ways that one does integrals that

4696
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:04,250
the ways that one does integrals that
 

4697
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:05,530
the ways that one does integrals that
show up in particle physics and so on

4698
01:31:05,530 --> 01:31:05,540
show up in particle physics and so on
 

4699
01:31:05,540 --> 01:31:07,750
show up in particle physics and so on
turns out the way we've actually done it

4700
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:07,760
turns out the way we've actually done it
 

4701
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:09,970
turns out the way we've actually done it
is very different from that way what do

4702
01:31:09,970 --> 01:31:09,980
is very different from that way what do
 

4703
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:11,740
is very different from that way what do
you make of that difference between so

4704
01:31:11,740 --> 01:31:11,750
you make of that difference between so
 

4705
01:31:11,750 --> 01:31:14,350
you make of that difference between so
fireman was actually quite remarkable at

01:31:14,350 --> 01:31:14,360
fireman was actually quite remarkable at
 

4707
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:17,800

creating sort of intuitive like diving
 

4709
01:31:17,810 --> 01:31:19,720

the funny thing about him was that the

4716
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:27,530
the funny thing about him was that the
 

4717
01:31:27,530 --> 01:31:29,380
the funny thing about him was that the
thing he was really really really good

4718
01:31:29,380 --> 01:31:29,390
thing he was really really really good
 

4719
01:31:29,390 --> 01:31:32,020
thing he was really really really good
at is calculating stuff and but he

4720
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:32,030
at is calculating stuff and but he
 

4721
01:31:32,030 --> 01:31:34,660
at is calculating stuff and but he
thought that was easy because he was

4722
01:31:34,660 --> 01:31:34,670
thought that was easy because he was
 

4723
01:31:34,670 --> 01:31:36,130
thought that was easy because he was
really good at it and so he would do

4724
01:31:36,130 --> 01:31:36,140
really good at it and so he would do
 

4725
01:31:36,140 --> 01:31:38,110
really good at it and so he would do
these things where he would calculate

4726
01:31:38,110 --> 01:31:38,120
these things where he would calculate
 

4727
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:41,800
these things where he would calculate
some do some complicated calculation in

4728
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:41,810
some do some complicated calculation in
 

4729
01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:43,540
some do some complicated calculation in
quantum field theory for example come

4730
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:43,550
quantum field theory for example come

01:31:43,550 --> 01:31:45,370
quantum field theory for example come
out with a result wouldn't tell

4732
01:31:45,370 --> 01:31:45,380
out with a result wouldn't tell
 

4733
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:46,450
out with a result wouldn't tell
everybody about the complicated

4734
01:31:46,450 --> 01:31:46,460
everybody about the complicated
 

4735
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:47,620
everybody about the complicated
calculation because thought that was

4736
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:47,630
calculation because thought that was
 

4737
01:31:47,630 --> 01:31:48,010
calculation because thought that was
easy

4738
01:31:48,010 --> 01:31:48,020
easy
 

4739
01:31:48,020 --> 01:31:49,720
easy
he thought the really impressive thing

4740
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:49,730
he thought the really impressive thing
 

4741
01:31:49,730 --> 01:31:51,760
he thought the really impressive thing
was to have this simple intuition about

4742
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:51,770
was to have this simple intuition about
 

4743
01:31:51,770 --> 01:31:54,670
was to have this simple intuition about
how everything worse so he invented that

4744
01:31:54,670 --> 01:31:54,680
how everything worse so he invented that
 

4745
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:57,220
how everything worse so he invented that
at the end and you know because he'd

4746
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:57,230
at the end and you know because he'd
 

4747
01:31:57,230 --> 01:31:58,720
at the end and you know because he'd
done this calculation and knew what how

4748
01:31:58,720 --> 01:31:58,730
done this calculation and knew what how
 

4749
01:31:58,730 --> 01:32:01,210
done this calculation and knew what how
it worked it was a lot easier it's a lot

4750
01:32:01,210 --> 01:32:01,220
it worked it was a lot easier it's a lot
 

4751
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:02,830
it worked it was a lot easier it's a lot
easier to have good intuition when you

4752
01:32:02,830 --> 01:32:02,840
easier to have good intuition when you
 

4753
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:05,200
easier to have good intuition when you
know what the answer is and then and

4754
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:05,210
know what the answer is and then and
 

4755
01:32:05,210 --> 01:32:06,400
know what the answer is and then and
then he would just not tell anybody

4756
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:06,410
then he would just not tell anybody
 

4757
01:32:06,410 --> 01:32:08,140
then he would just not tell anybody
about these calculations he wasn't

4758
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:08,150
about these calculations he wasn't
 

4759
01:32:08,150 --> 01:32:10,420
about these calculations he wasn't
meaning that maliciously so to speak is

4760
01:32:10,420 --> 01:32:10,430
meaning that maliciously so to speak is
 

4761
01:32:10,430 --> 01:32:12,010
meaning that maliciously so to speak is
just he thought that was easy

4762
01:32:12,010 --> 01:32:12,020
just he thought that was easy
 

4763
01:32:12,020 --> 01:32:14,950
just he thought that was easy
yeah um and and that's you know that led

4764
01:32:14,950 --> 01:32:14,960
yeah um and and that's you know that led
 

4765
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:16,000
yeah um and and that's you know that led
to areas where people were just

4766
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:16,010
to areas where people were just
 

4767
01:32:16,010 --> 01:32:17,680
to areas where people were just
completely mystified and they kind of

4768
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:17,690
completely mystified and they kind of
 

4769
01:32:17,690 --> 01:32:19,630
completely mystified and they kind of
followed his intuition but nobody could

4770
01:32:19,630 --> 01:32:19,640
followed his intuition but nobody could
 

4771
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:22,240
followed his intuition but nobody could
tell why it worked because actually the

4772
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:22,250
tell why it worked because actually the
 

4773
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:23,470
tell why it worked because actually the
reason it worked was because he done all

4774
01:32:23,470 --> 01:32:23,480
reason it worked was because he done all
 

4775
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:24,850
reason it worked was because he done all
these calculations and he knew that it

4776
01:32:24,850 --> 01:32:24,860
these calculations and he knew that it
 

4777
01:32:24,860 --> 01:32:26,950
these calculations and he knew that it
was would work and you know when I pee

4778
01:32:26,950 --> 01:32:26,960
was would work and you know when I pee
 

4779
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:29,380
was would work and you know when I pee
and I worked a bit on quantum computers

4780
01:32:29,380 --> 01:32:29,390
and I worked a bit on quantum computers
 

4781
01:32:29,390 --> 01:32:33,460
and I worked a bit on quantum computers
actually back in 1980-81 but before

4782
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:33,470
actually back in 1980-81 but before
 

4783
01:32:33,470 --> 01:32:34,870
actually back in 1980-81 but before
anybody had heard of those things and

4784
01:32:34,870 --> 01:32:34,880
anybody had heard of those things and
 

4785
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:38,920
anybody had heard of those things and
you know the typical mode of um I mean

4786
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:38,930
you know the typical mode of um I mean
 

4787
01:32:38,930 --> 01:32:40,360
you know the typical mode of um I mean
he always used to say and I now think

4788
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:40,370
he always used to say and I now think
 

4789
01:32:40,370 --> 01:32:41,590
he always used to say and I now think
about this because I'm about the age

4790
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:41,600
about this because I'm about the age
 

4791
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,020
about this because I'm about the age
that he was when I worked with him and

4792
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:44,030
that he was when I worked with him and
 

4793
01:32:44,030 --> 01:32:46,150
that he was when I worked with him and
you know I see that people have 1/3 my

4794
01:32:46,150 --> 01:32:46,160
you know I see that people have 1/3 my
 

4795
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:48,490
you know I see that people have 1/3 my
age so to speak and oh he was always

4796
01:32:48,490 --> 01:32:48,500
age so to speak and oh he was always
 

4797
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:50,200
age so to speak and oh he was always
complaining that I was one-third his age

4798
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:50,210
complaining that I was one-third his age
 

4799
01:32:50,210 --> 01:32:54,400
complaining that I was one-third his age
and so for various things but but you

4800
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:54,410
and so for various things but but you
 

4801
01:32:54,410 --> 01:32:57,220
and so for various things but but you
know he would do some calculation by by

4802
01:32:57,220 --> 01:32:57,230
know he would do some calculation by by
 

4803
01:32:57,230 --> 01:32:58,870
know he would do some calculation by by
hand you know blackboard and things come

4804
01:32:58,870 --> 01:32:58,880
hand you know blackboard and things come
 

4805
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:01,210
hand you know blackboard and things come
up with some answer I'd say I don't

4806
01:33:01,210 --> 01:33:01,220
up with some answer I'd say I don't
 

4807
01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:03,880
up with some answer I'd say I don't
understand this you know I do something

4808
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:03,890
understand this you know I do something
 

4809
01:33:03,890 --> 01:33:07,060
understand this you know I do something
with a computer and he'd say you know I

4810
01:33:07,060 --> 01:33:07,070
with a computer and he'd say you know I
 

4811
01:33:07,070 --> 01:33:09,430
with a computer and he'd say you know I
don't understand this so it'd be some

4812
01:33:09,430 --> 01:33:09,440
don't understand this so it'd be some
 

4813
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:11,350
don't understand this so it'd be some
big argument about what was you know

4814
01:33:11,350 --> 01:33:11,360
big argument about what was you know
 

4815
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:13,060
big argument about what was you know
what was going on but that it was always

4816
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:13,070
what was going on but that it was always
 

4817
01:33:13,070 --> 01:33:14,200
what was going on but that it was always
some

4818
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:14,210
some
 

4819
01:33:14,210 --> 01:33:17,590
some
and I think actually we many of the

4820
01:33:17,590 --> 01:33:17,600
and I think actually we many of the
 

4821
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:19,720
and I think actually we many of the
things that we sort of realized about

4822
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:19,730
things that we sort of realized about
 

4823
01:33:19,730 --> 01:33:22,060
things that we sort of realized about
quantum computing that were sort of

4824
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:22,070
quantum computing that were sort of
 

4825
01:33:22,070 --> 01:33:23,500
quantum computing that were sort of
issues that have to do particularly with

4826
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:23,510
issues that have to do particularly with
 

4827
01:33:23,510 --> 01:33:25,690
issues that have to do particularly with
the measurement process are kind of

4828
01:33:25,690 --> 01:33:25,700
the measurement process are kind of
 

4829
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:27,940
the measurement process are kind of
still issues today and I kind of find it

4830
01:33:27,940 --> 01:33:27,950
still issues today and I kind of find it
 

4831
01:33:27,950 --> 01:33:29,620
still issues today and I kind of find it
interesting it's a funny thing in

4832
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:29,630
interesting it's a funny thing in
 

4833
01:33:29,630 --> 01:33:32,340
interesting it's a funny thing in
science that these you know that there's

4834
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:32,350
science that these you know that there's
 

4835
01:33:32,350 --> 01:33:34,540
science that these you know that there's
there's a remarkable happens in

4836
01:33:34,540 --> 01:33:34,550
there's a remarkable happens in
 

4837
01:33:34,550 --> 01:33:36,700
there's a remarkable happens in
technology too there's a remarkable sort

4838
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:36,710
technology too there's a remarkable sort
 

4839
01:33:36,710 --> 01:33:38,950
technology too there's a remarkable sort
of repetition of history that ends up

4840
01:33:38,950 --> 01:33:38,960
of repetition of history that ends up
 

4841
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:41,350
of repetition of history that ends up
occurring eventually things really get

4842
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:41,360
occurring eventually things really get
 

4843
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:43,780
occurring eventually things really get
nailed down but it often takes a while

4844
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:43,790
nailed down but it often takes a while
 

4845
01:33:43,790 --> 01:33:45,910
nailed down but it often takes a while
and it often things come back decades

4846
01:33:45,910 --> 01:33:45,920
and it often things come back decades
 

4847
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:49,180
and it often things come back decades
later well for example I could tell a

4848
01:33:49,180 --> 01:33:49,190
later well for example I could tell a
 

4849
01:33:49,190 --> 01:33:51,010
later well for example I could tell a
story actually happened right down the

4850
01:33:51,010 --> 01:33:51,020
story actually happened right down the
 

4851
01:33:51,020 --> 01:33:53,890
story actually happened right down the
street from here um I will move both

4852
01:33:53,890 --> 01:33:53,900
street from here um I will move both
 

4853
01:33:53,900 --> 01:33:55,209
street from here um I will move both
that thinking machines I had been

4854
01:33:55,209 --> 01:33:55,219
that thinking machines I had been
 

4855
01:33:55,219 --> 01:33:57,340
that thinking machines I had been
working on this particular cellular

4856
01:33:57,340 --> 01:33:57,350
working on this particular cellular
 

4857
01:33:57,350 --> 01:34:00,100
working on this particular cellular
automaton will rule 30 that has this

4858
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:00,110
automaton will rule 30 that has this
 

4859
01:34:00,110 --> 01:34:02,830
automaton will rule 30 that has this
feature that it from very simple initial

4860
01:34:02,830 --> 01:34:02,840
feature that it from very simple initial
 

4861
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:04,330
feature that it from very simple initial
conditions it makes really complicated

4862
01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:04,340
conditions it makes really complicated
 

4863
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:05,560
conditions it makes really complicated
behavior okay

4864
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:05,570
behavior okay
 

4865
01:34:05,570 --> 01:34:09,700
behavior okay
so and actually of all silly physical

4866
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:09,710
so and actually of all silly physical
 

4867
01:34:09,710 --> 01:34:13,330
so and actually of all silly physical
things using this big parallel computer

4868
01:34:13,330 --> 01:34:13,340
things using this big parallel computer
 

4869
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:15,310
things using this big parallel computer
called a connection machine that that

4870
01:34:15,310 --> 01:34:15,320
called a connection machine that that
 

4871
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:17,890
called a connection machine that that
company was making I generated this

4872
01:34:17,890 --> 01:34:17,900
company was making I generated this
 

4873
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:20,620
company was making I generated this
giant printout of rule 30 on very I'm

4874
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:20,630
giant printout of rule 30 on very I'm
 

4875
01:34:20,630 --> 01:34:22,870
giant printout of rule 30 on very I'm
actually on the same kind of same kind

4876
01:34:22,870 --> 01:34:22,880
actually on the same kind of same kind
 

4877
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:26,370
actually on the same kind of same kind
of printer that people use to make um

4878
01:34:26,370 --> 01:34:26,380
of printer that people use to make um
 

4879
01:34:26,380 --> 01:34:29,200
of printer that people use to make um
layouts for microprocessors so one of

4880
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:29,210
layouts for microprocessors so one of
 

4881
01:34:29,210 --> 01:34:32,440
layouts for microprocessors so one of
these big you know large format printers

4882
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:32,450
these big you know large format printers
 

4883
01:34:32,450 --> 01:34:34,990
these big you know large format printers
with high resolution and so on so okay

4884
01:34:34,990 --> 01:34:35,000
with high resolution and so on so okay
 

4885
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,420
with high resolution and so on so okay
so print this out lots of very tiny

4886
01:34:37,420 --> 01:34:37,430
so print this out lots of very tiny
 

4887
01:34:37,430 --> 01:34:39,910
so print this out lots of very tiny
cells and so there was sort of a

4888
01:34:39,910 --> 01:34:39,920
cells and so there was sort of a
 

4889
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:43,090
cells and so there was sort of a
question of how some features of that

4890
01:34:43,090 --> 01:34:43,100
question of how some features of that
 

4891
01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:45,459
question of how some features of that
pattern and so it was very much a

4892
01:34:45,459 --> 01:34:45,469
pattern and so it was very much a
 

4893
01:34:45,469 --> 01:34:47,830
pattern and so it was very much a
physical you know on the floor with

4894
01:34:47,830 --> 01:34:47,840
physical you know on the floor with
 

4895
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:49,180
physical you know on the floor with
meter rules trying to measure different

4896
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:49,190
meter rules trying to measure different
 

4897
01:34:49,190 --> 01:34:53,200
meter rules trying to measure different
things so so Feynman kind of takes me

4898
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:53,210
things so so Feynman kind of takes me
 

4899
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:54,310
things so so Feynman kind of takes me
aside we've been doing that for a little

4900
01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:54,320
aside we've been doing that for a little
 

4901
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:56,650
aside we've been doing that for a little
while and takes me aside he says I just

4902
01:34:56,650 --> 01:34:56,660
while and takes me aside he says I just
 

4903
01:34:56,660 --> 01:34:58,270
while and takes me aside he says I just
want to know this one thing he says I

4904
01:34:58,270 --> 01:34:58,280
want to know this one thing he says I
 

4905
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:00,520
want to know this one thing he says I
want to know how did you know that this

4906
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:00,530
want to know how did you know that this
 

4907
01:35:00,530 --> 01:35:03,160
want to know how did you know that this
rule 30 thing would produce all this

4908
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:03,170
rule 30 thing would produce all this
 

4909
01:35:03,170 --> 01:35:04,810
rule 30 thing would produce all this
really complicated behavior that is so

4910
01:35:04,810 --> 01:35:04,820
really complicated behavior that is so
 

4911
01:35:04,820 --> 01:35:07,120
really complicated behavior that is so
complicated that weird you know going

4912
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:07,130
complicated that weird you know going
 

4913
01:35:07,130 --> 01:35:09,430
complicated that weird you know going
around this big printout and so on and I

4914
01:35:09,430 --> 01:35:09,440
around this big printout and so on and I
 

4915
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:11,920
around this big printout and so on and I
said well I didn't know I just

4916
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:11,930
said well I didn't know I just
 

4917
01:35:11,930 --> 01:35:13,870
said well I didn't know I just
enumerated all the possible rules and

4918
01:35:13,870 --> 01:35:13,880
enumerated all the possible rules and
 

4919
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:15,850
enumerated all the possible rules and
then observed that that's what happened

4920
01:35:15,850 --> 01:35:15,860
then observed that that's what happened
 

4921
01:35:15,860 --> 01:35:19,030
then observed that that's what happened
he said ah I feel a lot better you know

4922
01:35:19,030 --> 01:35:19,040
he said ah I feel a lot better you know
 

4923
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:21,280
he said ah I feel a lot better you know
I thought you had some intuition that he

4924
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:21,290
I thought you had some intuition that he
 

4925
01:35:21,290 --> 01:35:23,770
I thought you had some intuition that he
didn't have that would let why I said no

4926
01:35:23,770 --> 01:35:23,780
didn't have that would let why I said no
 

4927
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:26,320
didn't have that would let why I said no
no no intuition just experimental

4928
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:26,330
no no intuition just experimental
 

4929
01:35:26,330 --> 01:35:27,360
no no intuition just experimental
science so that's

4930
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:27,370
science so that's
 

4931
01:35:27,370 --> 01:35:30,390
science so that's
such a beautiful sort of dichotomy there

4932
01:35:30,390 --> 01:35:30,400
such a beautiful sort of dichotomy there
 

4933
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:33,120
such a beautiful sort of dichotomy there
of that's exactly showed is you really

4934
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:33,130
of that's exactly showed is you really
 

4935
01:35:33,130 --> 01:35:35,340
of that's exactly showed is you really
can't have an intuition about an

4936
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:35,350
can't have an intuition about an
 

4937
01:35:35,350 --> 01:35:37,230
can't have an intuition about an
irreducible I mean you have to run us

4938
01:35:37,230 --> 01:35:37,240
irreducible I mean you have to run us
 

4939
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:38,430
irreducible I mean you have to run us
yes that's right

4940
01:35:38,430 --> 01:35:38,440
yes that's right
 

4941
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:39,870
yes that's right
that's so hard for us humans and

4942
01:35:39,870 --> 01:35:39,880
that's so hard for us humans and
 

4943
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:43,590
that's so hard for us humans and
especially brilliant physicist like

4944
01:35:43,590 --> 01:35:43,600
especially brilliant physicist like
 

4945
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:46,610
especially brilliant physicist like
fireman to say that you can't haven't

4946
01:35:46,610 --> 01:35:46,620
fireman to say that you can't haven't
 

4947
01:35:46,620 --> 01:35:50,730
fireman to say that you can't haven't
compressed clean intuition about how the

4948
01:35:50,730 --> 01:35:50,740
compressed clean intuition about how the
 

4949
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:54,120
compressed clean intuition about how the
whole thing yes works yes no he was I

4950
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:54,130
whole thing yes works yes no he was I
 

4951
01:35:54,130 --> 01:35:55,890
whole thing yes works yes no he was I
mean I think he was sort of on the edge

4952
01:35:55,890 --> 01:35:55,900
mean I think he was sort of on the edge
 

4953
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:57,600
mean I think he was sort of on the edge
of understanding that point about

4954
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:57,610
of understanding that point about
 

4955
01:35:57,610 --> 01:35:59,910
of understanding that point about
computation and I think he found that I

4956
01:35:59,910 --> 01:35:59,920
computation and I think he found that I
 

4957
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:01,680
computation and I think he found that I
think he always found computation

4958
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:01,690
think he always found computation
 

4959
01:36:01,690 --> 01:36:03,870
think he always found computation
interesting and I think that was sort of

4960
01:36:03,870 --> 01:36:03,880
interesting and I think that was sort of
 

4961
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:06,390
interesting and I think that was sort of
what he was a little bit poking at I

4962
01:36:06,390 --> 01:36:06,400
what he was a little bit poking at I
 

4963
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,850
what he was a little bit poking at I
mean yeah that intuition you know the

4964
01:36:08,850 --> 01:36:08,860
mean yeah that intuition you know the
 

4965
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:10,500
mean yeah that intuition you know the
difficulty of discovering things like

4966
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:10,510
difficulty of discovering things like
 

4967
01:36:10,510 --> 01:36:12,450
difficulty of discovering things like
even you say oh you know you just didn't

4968
01:36:12,450 --> 01:36:12,460
even you say oh you know you just didn't
 

4969
01:36:12,460 --> 01:36:13,770
even you say oh you know you just didn't
write all the cases in just find one

4970
01:36:13,770 --> 01:36:13,780
write all the cases in just find one
 

4971
01:36:13,780 --> 01:36:15,000
write all the cases in just find one
that does something interesting right

4972
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:15,010
that does something interesting right
 

4973
01:36:15,010 --> 01:36:18,540
that does something interesting right
sounds very easy turns out like I missed

4974
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:18,550
sounds very easy turns out like I missed
 

4975
01:36:18,550 --> 01:36:20,490
sounds very easy turns out like I missed
it when I first saw it because I had

4976
01:36:20,490 --> 01:36:20,500
it when I first saw it because I had
 

4977
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:22,350
it when I first saw it because I had
kind of an intuition that said it

4978
01:36:22,350 --> 01:36:22,360
kind of an intuition that said it
 

4979
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:24,180
kind of an intuition that said it
shouldn't be there and so I had kind of

4980
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:24,190
shouldn't be there and so I had kind of
 

4981
01:36:24,190 --> 01:36:25,920
shouldn't be there and so I had kind of
arguments oh I'm gonna ignore that case

4982
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:25,930
arguments oh I'm gonna ignore that case
 

4983
01:36:25,930 --> 01:36:29,160
arguments oh I'm gonna ignore that case
because whatever um and so how did you

4984
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:29,170
because whatever um and so how did you
 

4985
01:36:29,170 --> 01:36:31,530
because whatever um and so how did you
have an open mind enough because you're

4986
01:36:31,530 --> 01:36:31,540
have an open mind enough because you're
 

4987
01:36:31,540 --> 01:36:33,270
have an open mind enough because you're
essentially the same person is just your

4988
01:36:33,270 --> 01:36:33,280
essentially the same person is just your
 

4989
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:34,890
essentially the same person is just your
fight like for the same kind of physics

4990
01:36:34,890 --> 01:36:34,900
fight like for the same kind of physics
 

4991
01:36:34,900 --> 01:36:37,470
fight like for the same kind of physics
type of thinking how did you find

4992
01:36:37,470 --> 01:36:37,480
type of thinking how did you find
 

4993
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:39,690
type of thinking how did you find
yourself having a sufficiently open mind

4994
01:36:39,690 --> 01:36:39,700
yourself having a sufficiently open mind
 

4995
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:43,620
yourself having a sufficiently open mind
to be open to watching rules and them

4996
01:36:43,620 --> 01:36:43,630
to be open to watching rules and them
 

4997
01:36:43,630 --> 01:36:45,480
to be open to watching rules and them
revealing complexity yeah I think that's

4998
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:45,490
revealing complexity yeah I think that's
 

4999
01:36:45,490 --> 01:36:46,560
revealing complexity yeah I think that's
an interesting question I've wondered

5000
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:46,570
an interesting question I've wondered
 

5001
01:36:46,570 --> 01:36:48,150
an interesting question I've wondered
about that myself because it's kind of

5002
01:36:48,150 --> 01:36:48,160
about that myself because it's kind of
 

5003
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:49,860
about that myself because it's kind of
like you know you live through these

5004
01:36:49,860 --> 01:36:49,870
like you know you live through these
 

5005
01:36:49,870 --> 01:36:52,020
like you know you live through these
things and then you say what was the

5006
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:52,030
things and then you say what was the
 

5007
01:36:52,030 --> 01:36:53,850
things and then you say what was the
historical story and sometimes the

5008
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:53,860
historical story and sometimes the
 

5009
01:36:53,860 --> 01:36:55,500
historical story and sometimes the
historical story that you realized after

5010
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:55,510
historical story that you realized after
 

5011
01:36:55,510 --> 01:36:57,060
historical story that you realized after
the fact was not what you lived through

5012
01:36:57,060 --> 01:36:57,070
the fact was not what you lived through
 

5013
01:36:57,070 --> 01:37:00,480
the fact was not what you lived through
so to speak and so you know what I

5014
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:00,490
so to speak and so you know what I
 

5015
01:37:00,490 --> 01:37:04,680
so to speak and so you know what I
realized is I think what happened is you

5016
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:04,690
realized is I think what happened is you
 

5017
01:37:04,690 --> 01:37:07,070
realized is I think what happened is you
know I did physics kind of like

5018
01:37:07,070 --> 01:37:07,080
know I did physics kind of like
 

5019
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:09,210
know I did physics kind of like
reductionistic physics where you're

5020
01:37:09,210 --> 01:37:09,220
reductionistic physics where you're
 

5021
01:37:09,220 --> 01:37:10,710
reductionistic physics where you're
throw-in the universe and you have tells

5022
01:37:10,710 --> 01:37:10,720
throw-in the universe and you have tells
 

5023
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:12,270
throw-in the universe and you have tells
go figure out what's going on inside it

5024
01:37:12,270 --> 01:37:12,280
go figure out what's going on inside it
 

5025
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:15,210
go figure out what's going on inside it
and then I started building computer

5026
01:37:15,210 --> 01:37:15,220
and then I started building computer
 

5027
01:37:15,220 --> 01:37:17,700
and then I started building computer
tools and I started building my first

5028
01:37:17,700 --> 01:37:17,710
tools and I started building my first
 

5029
01:37:17,710 --> 01:37:19,500
tools and I started building my first
computer language for example and

5030
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:19,510
computer language for example and
 

5031
01:37:19,510 --> 01:37:21,810
computer language for example and
computer language is not like it's sort

5032
01:37:21,810 --> 01:37:21,820
computer language is not like it's sort
 

5033
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:23,340
computer language is not like it's sort
of like physics in the sense that you

5034
01:37:23,340 --> 01:37:23,350
of like physics in the sense that you
 

5035
01:37:23,350 --> 01:37:24,780
of like physics in the sense that you
have to take all those computations

5036
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:24,790
have to take all those computations
 

5037
01:37:24,790 --> 01:37:26,760
have to take all those computations
people want to do and kind of drill down

5038
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:26,770
people want to do and kind of drill down
 

5039
01:37:26,770 --> 01:37:28,920
people want to do and kind of drill down
and find the primitives that they can

5040
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:28,930
and find the primitives that they can
 

5041
01:37:28,930 --> 01:37:31,020
and find the primitives that they can
all be made of but then you do something

5042
01:37:31,020 --> 01:37:31,030
all be made of but then you do something
 

5043
01:37:31,030 --> 01:37:32,460
all be made of but then you do something
that's really different because you just

5044
01:37:32,460 --> 01:37:32,470
that's really different because you just
 

5045
01:37:32,470 --> 01:37:34,290
that's really different because you just
you're just saying okay these are the

5046
01:37:34,290 --> 01:37:34,300
you're just saying okay these are the
 

5047
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:36,750
you're just saying okay these are the
primitives now you know hopefully

5048
01:37:36,750 --> 01:37:36,760
primitives now you know hopefully
 

5049
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:38,310
primitives now you know hopefully
they'll be useful to people let's build

5050
01:37:38,310 --> 01:37:38,320
they'll be useful to people let's build
 

5051
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:39,810
they'll be useful to people let's build
up from there so you're essentially

5052
01:37:39,810 --> 01:37:39,820
up from there so you're essentially
 

5053
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:40,910
up from there so you're essentially
building an

5054
01:37:40,910 --> 01:37:40,920
building an
 

5055
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:43,910
building an
show universe in a sense where you make

5056
01:37:43,910 --> 01:37:43,920
show universe in a sense where you make
 

5057
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:44,959
show universe in a sense where you make
this language you've got these

5058
01:37:44,959 --> 01:37:44,969
this language you've got these
 

5059
01:37:44,969 --> 01:37:46,970
this language you've got these
primitives you're just building whatever

5060
01:37:46,970 --> 01:37:46,980
primitives you're just building whatever
 

5061
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:50,060
primitives you're just building whatever
you feel like building and that's and so

5062
01:37:50,060 --> 01:37:50,070
you feel like building and that's and so
 

5063
01:37:50,070 --> 01:37:51,650
you feel like building and that's and so
it was sort of interesting for me

5064
01:37:51,650 --> 01:37:51,660
it was sort of interesting for me
 

5065
01:37:51,660 --> 01:37:53,419
it was sort of interesting for me
because from doing science where you

5066
01:37:53,419 --> 01:37:53,429
because from doing science where you
 

5067
01:37:53,429 --> 01:37:54,680
because from doing science where you
just throw in the universe as the

5068
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:54,690
just throw in the universe as the
 

5069
01:37:54,690 --> 01:37:58,490
just throw in the universe as the
universe is to then just being told you

5070
01:37:58,490 --> 01:37:58,500
universe is to then just being told you
 

5071
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:00,169
universe is to then just being told you
know you can make up any universe you

5072
01:38:00,169 --> 01:38:00,179
know you can make up any universe you
 

5073
01:38:00,179 --> 01:38:02,750
know you can make up any universe you
want and so I think that experience of

5074
01:38:02,750 --> 01:38:02,760
want and so I think that experience of
 

5075
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:05,000
want and so I think that experience of
of making a computer language which is

5076
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:05,010
of making a computer language which is
 

5077
01:38:05,010 --> 01:38:06,590
of making a computer language which is
essentially building your own universe

5078
01:38:06,590 --> 01:38:06,600
essentially building your own universe
 

5079
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:09,860
essentially building your own universe
so to speak is you know that's kind of

5080
01:38:09,860 --> 01:38:09,870
so to speak is you know that's kind of
 

5081
01:38:09,870 --> 01:38:12,560
so to speak is you know that's kind of
the that's that's what gave me a

5082
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:12,570
the that's that's what gave me a
 

5083
01:38:12,570 --> 01:38:14,750
the that's that's what gave me a
somewhat different attitude towards what

5084
01:38:14,750 --> 01:38:14,760
somewhat different attitude towards what
 

5085
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:16,490
somewhat different attitude towards what
might be possible it's like let's just

5086
01:38:16,490 --> 01:38:16,500
might be possible it's like let's just
 

5087
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:18,050
might be possible it's like let's just
explore what can be done in these

5088
01:38:18,050 --> 01:38:18,060
explore what can be done in these
 

5089
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:20,390
explore what can be done in these
artificial universes rather than

5090
01:38:20,390 --> 01:38:20,400
artificial universes rather than
 

5091
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,939
artificial universes rather than
thinking the natural science way of

5092
01:38:22,939 --> 01:38:22,949
thinking the natural science way of
 

5093
01:38:22,949 --> 01:38:24,620
thinking the natural science way of
let's be constrained by how the universe

5094
01:38:24,620 --> 01:38:24,630
let's be constrained by how the universe
 

5095
01:38:24,630 --> 01:38:26,150
let's be constrained by how the universe
actually is yeah by being able to

5096
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:26,160
actually is yeah by being able to
 

5097
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:29,120
actually is yeah by being able to
program essentially you've as opposed to

5098
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:29,130
program essentially you've as opposed to
 

5099
01:38:29,130 --> 01:38:31,520
program essentially you've as opposed to
being limited to just your mind and a

5100
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:31,530
being limited to just your mind and a
 

5101
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:34,729
being limited to just your mind and a
pen you you now have you've basically

5102
01:38:34,729 --> 01:38:34,739
pen you you now have you've basically
 

5103
01:38:34,739 --> 01:38:36,860
pen you you now have you've basically
built another brain that you can use to

5104
01:38:36,860 --> 01:38:36,870
built another brain that you can use to
 

5105
01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:39,080
built another brain that you can use to
explore the universe but yeah computer

5106
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:39,090
explore the universe but yeah computer
 

5107
01:38:39,090 --> 01:38:41,030
explore the universe but yeah computer
program you know this is kind of a brain

5108
01:38:41,030 --> 01:38:41,040
program you know this is kind of a brain
 

5109
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,979
program you know this is kind of a brain
right and it's well it's it's or

5110
01:38:42,979 --> 01:38:42,989
right and it's well it's it's or
 

5111
01:38:42,989 --> 01:38:45,110
right and it's well it's it's or
telescope or you know it's a tool and it

5112
01:38:45,110 --> 01:38:45,120
telescope or you know it's a tool and it
 

5113
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:47,120
telescope or you know it's a tool and it
lets you see stuff but there's something

5114
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:47,130
lets you see stuff but there's something
 

5115
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:48,200
lets you see stuff but there's something
fundamentally different between a

5116
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:48,210
fundamentally different between a
 

5117
01:38:48,210 --> 01:38:51,490
fundamentally different between a
computer and a telescope I mean it just

5118
01:38:51,490 --> 01:38:51,500
computer and a telescope I mean it just
 

5119
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:54,709
computer and a telescope I mean it just
yeah I'm Amanda sighs the notion but

5120
01:38:54,709 --> 01:38:54,719
yeah I'm Amanda sighs the notion but
 

5121
01:38:54,719 --> 01:38:58,880
yeah I'm Amanda sighs the notion but
it's more general and it's it's I think

5122
01:38:58,880 --> 01:38:58,890
it's more general and it's it's I think
 

5123
01:38:58,890 --> 01:39:03,530
it's more general and it's it's I think
I mean this point about you know people

5124
01:39:03,530 --> 01:39:03,540
I mean this point about you know people
 

5125
01:39:03,540 --> 01:39:06,380
I mean this point about you know people
say oh such and such a thing was almost

5126
01:39:06,380 --> 01:39:06,390
say oh such and such a thing was almost
 

5127
01:39:06,390 --> 01:39:08,320
say oh such and such a thing was almost
discovered at such and such a time the

5128
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:08,330
discovered at such and such a time the
 

5129
01:39:08,330 --> 01:39:10,910
discovered at such and such a time the
the distance between you know the

5130
01:39:10,910 --> 01:39:10,920
the distance between you know the
 

5131
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:12,470
the distance between you know the
building the paradigm that allows you to

5132
01:39:12,470 --> 01:39:12,480
building the paradigm that allows you to
 

5133
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,419
building the paradigm that allows you to
actually understand stuff or allows one

5134
01:39:14,419 --> 01:39:14,429
actually understand stuff or allows one
 

5135
01:39:14,429 --> 01:39:16,130
actually understand stuff or allows one
to be open to seeing what's going on

5136
01:39:16,130 --> 01:39:16,140
to be open to seeing what's going on
 

5137
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:19,040
to be open to seeing what's going on
that's really hard and you know I think

5138
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:19,050
that's really hard and you know I think
 

5139
01:39:19,050 --> 01:39:22,580
that's really hard and you know I think
in I've been fortunate in my life that I

5140
01:39:22,580 --> 01:39:22,590
in I've been fortunate in my life that I
 

5141
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:23,930
in I've been fortunate in my life that I
spent a lot of my time building

5142
01:39:23,930 --> 01:39:23,940
spent a lot of my time building
 

5143
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:28,010
spent a lot of my time building
computational language and that's an

5144
01:39:28,010 --> 01:39:28,020
computational language and that's an
 

5145
01:39:28,020 --> 01:39:31,340
computational language and that's an
activity that in a sense works by sort

5146
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:31,350
activity that in a sense works by sort
 

5147
01:39:31,350 --> 01:39:35,270
activity that in a sense works by sort
of having to kind of create another

5148
01:39:35,270 --> 01:39:35,280
of having to kind of create another
 

5149
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:36,890
of having to kind of create another
level of abstraction and kind of be open

5150
01:39:36,890 --> 01:39:36,900
level of abstraction and kind of be open
 

5151
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:39,650
level of abstraction and kind of be open
to different kinds of structures but you

5152
01:39:39,650 --> 01:39:39,660
to different kinds of structures but you
 

5153
01:39:39,660 --> 01:39:42,200
to different kinds of structures but you
know it's it's always some I mean I'm

5154
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:42,210
know it's it's always some I mean I'm
 

5155
01:39:42,210 --> 01:39:44,720
know it's it's always some I mean I'm
fully aware of I suppose the fact that I

5156
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:44,730
fully aware of I suppose the fact that I
 

5157
01:39:44,730 --> 01:39:47,660
fully aware of I suppose the fact that I
have seen it a bunch of times of how

5158
01:39:47,660 --> 01:39:47,670
have seen it a bunch of times of how
 

5159
01:39:47,670 --> 01:39:49,430
have seen it a bunch of times of how
easy it is to miss the obvious so to

5160
01:39:49,430 --> 01:39:49,440
easy it is to miss the obvious so to
 

5161
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:52,459
easy it is to miss the obvious so to
speak that at least is factored into my

5162
01:39:52,459 --> 01:39:52,469
speak that at least is factored into my
 

5163
01:39:52,469 --> 01:39:54,930
speak that at least is factored into my
attempt to not miss the obvious

5164
01:39:54,930 --> 01:39:54,940
attempt to not miss the obvious
 

5165
01:39:54,940 --> 01:39:58,260
attempt to not miss the obvious
although it may not succeed what do you

5166
01:39:58,260 --> 01:39:58,270
although it may not succeed what do you
 

5167
01:39:58,270 --> 01:40:02,250
although it may not succeed what do you
think is the role of ego in the history

5168
01:40:02,250 --> 01:40:02,260
think is the role of ego in the history
 

5169
01:40:02,260 --> 01:40:07,470
think is the role of ego in the history
of math and science and more sort of you

5170
01:40:07,470 --> 01:40:07,480
of math and science and more sort of you
 

5171
01:40:07,480 --> 01:40:09,000
of math and science and more sort of you
know a book title is something like a

5172
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:09,010
know a book title is something like a
 

5173
01:40:09,010 --> 01:40:12,180
know a book title is something like a
new kind of science you've accomplished

5174
01:40:12,180 --> 01:40:12,190
new kind of science you've accomplished
 

5175
01:40:12,190 --> 01:40:15,930
new kind of science you've accomplished
a huge amount in fact somebody said that

5176
01:40:15,930 --> 01:40:15,940
a huge amount in fact somebody said that
 

5177
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:17,700
a huge amount in fact somebody said that
Newton didn't have an ego and I looked

5178
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:17,710
Newton didn't have an ego and I looked
 

5179
01:40:17,710 --> 01:40:20,129
Newton didn't have an ego and I looked
into it and he had a huge ego yeah but

5180
01:40:20,129 --> 01:40:20,139
into it and he had a huge ego yeah but
 

5181
01:40:20,139 --> 01:40:23,010
into it and he had a huge ego yeah but
from an outsider's perspective some have

5182
01:40:23,010 --> 01:40:23,020
from an outsider's perspective some have
 

5183
01:40:23,020 --> 01:40:24,570
from an outsider's perspective some have
said that you have a bit of an ego as

5184
01:40:24,570 --> 01:40:24,580
said that you have a bit of an ego as
 

5185
01:40:24,580 --> 01:40:29,520
said that you have a bit of an ego as
well do you see it that way does ego get

5186
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:29,530
well do you see it that way does ego get
 

5187
01:40:29,530 --> 01:40:31,800
well do you see it that way does ego get
in the way is it empowering is it both

5188
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:31,810
in the way is it empowering is it both
 

5189
01:40:31,810 --> 01:40:34,080
in the way is it empowering is it both
so it's it's it's all implicated

5190
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:34,090
so it's it's it's all implicated
 

5191
01:40:34,090 --> 01:40:36,870
so it's it's it's all implicated
necessary I mean you know I've had look

5192
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:36,880
necessary I mean you know I've had look
 

5193
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:38,760
necessary I mean you know I've had look
I've spent more than half my life CEO in

5194
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:38,770
I've spent more than half my life CEO in
 

5195
01:40:38,770 --> 01:40:40,439
I've spent more than half my life CEO in
a tech company right ok

5196
01:40:40,439 --> 01:40:40,449
a tech company right ok
 

5197
01:40:40,449 --> 01:40:44,370
a tech company right ok
and you know that is a I think it's

5198
01:40:44,370 --> 01:40:44,380
and you know that is a I think it's
 

5199
01:40:44,380 --> 01:40:49,919
and you know that is a I think it's
actually very it means that one's ego is

5200
01:40:49,919 --> 01:40:49,929
actually very it means that one's ego is
 

5201
01:40:49,929 --> 01:40:51,930
actually very it means that one's ego is
not a distant thing it's the thing that

5202
01:40:51,930 --> 01:40:51,940
not a distant thing it's the thing that
 

5203
01:40:51,940 --> 01:40:53,640
not a distant thing it's the thing that
one encounters every day so to speak

5204
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:53,650
one encounters every day so to speak
 

5205
01:40:53,650 --> 01:40:55,860
one encounters every day so to speak
because it's it's all tied up with

5206
01:40:55,860 --> 01:40:55,870
because it's it's all tied up with
 

5207
01:40:55,870 --> 01:40:57,660
because it's it's all tied up with
leadership and with how one you know

5208
01:40:57,660 --> 01:40:57,670
leadership and with how one you know
 

5209
01:40:57,670 --> 01:40:59,459
leadership and with how one you know
develops an organization and all these

5210
01:40:59,459 --> 01:40:59,469
develops an organization and all these
 

5211
01:40:59,469 --> 01:41:01,590
develops an organization and all these
kinds of things so you know it may be

5212
01:41:01,590 --> 01:41:01,600
kinds of things so you know it may be
 

5213
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:03,000
kinds of things so you know it may be
that if I've been an academic for

5214
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:03,010
that if I've been an academic for
 

5215
01:41:03,010 --> 01:41:05,040
that if I've been an academic for
example I could have sort of you know

5216
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:05,050
example I could have sort of you know
 

5217
01:41:05,050 --> 01:41:07,649
example I could have sort of you know
check the ego put it on put on a shelf

5218
01:41:07,649 --> 01:41:07,659
check the ego put it on put on a shelf
 

5219
01:41:07,659 --> 01:41:09,180
check the ego put it on put on a shelf
somewhere and ignored its

5220
01:41:09,180 --> 01:41:09,190
somewhere and ignored its
 

5221
01:41:09,190 --> 01:41:11,399
somewhere and ignored its
characteristics but for your reminder it

5222
01:41:11,399 --> 01:41:11,409
characteristics but for your reminder it
 

5223
01:41:11,409 --> 01:41:14,459
characteristics but for your reminder it
quite often in the context of running a

5224
01:41:14,459 --> 01:41:14,469
quite often in the context of running a
 

5225
01:41:14,469 --> 01:41:16,290
quite often in the context of running a
company sure yeah I mean that's what

5226
01:41:16,290 --> 01:41:16,300
company sure yeah I mean that's what
 

5227
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:17,879
company sure yeah I mean that's what
it's about it's it's about leadership

5228
01:41:17,879 --> 01:41:17,889
it's about it's it's about leadership
 

5229
01:41:17,889 --> 01:41:21,180

and you know leadership is intimately
 

5231
01:41:21,190 --> 01:41:23,850
and you know leadership is intimately
tied to ego now what does it mean I mean

01:41:23,850 --> 01:41:23,860
tied to ego now what does it mean I mean
 

5233
01:41:23,860 --> 01:41:26,399
tied to ego now what does it mean I mean
what what is the you know for me I've

been fortunate that I think I have
 

5237
01:41:28,449 --> 01:41:30,899
been fortunate that I think I have
reasonable intellectual confidence so to

01:41:30,899 --> 01:41:30,909
reasonable intellectual confidence so to
 

5239
01:41:30,909 --> 01:41:34,890

these people who at this point if
 

5243
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:37,860
these people who at this point if
somebody tells me something and I just

01:41:37,860 --> 01:41:37,870
somebody tells me something and I just
 

5245
01:41:37,870 --> 01:41:40,979
somebody tells me something and I just
don't understand it my conclusion isn't

5246
01:41:40,979 --> 01:41:40,989
don't understand it my conclusion isn't
 

5247
01:41:40,989 --> 01:41:44,250
don't understand it my conclusion isn't
that means I'm dumb that my conclusion

5248
01:41:44,250 --> 01:41:44,260
that means I'm dumb that my conclusion
 

5249
01:41:44,260 --> 01:41:45,870
that means I'm dumb that my conclusion
is there's something wrong with what I'm

5250
01:41:45,870 --> 01:41:45,880
is there's something wrong with what I'm
 

5251
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:48,419
is there's something wrong with what I'm
being told and that was actually dick

5252
01:41:48,419 --> 01:41:48,429
being told and that was actually dick
 

5253
01:41:48,429 --> 01:41:50,399
being told and that was actually dick
Feynman used to have that that that

5254
01:41:50,399 --> 01:41:50,409
Feynman used to have that that that
 

5255
01:41:50,409 --> 01:41:52,740
Feynman used to have that that that
feature - he never really believed it he

5256
01:41:52,740 --> 01:41:52,750
feature - he never really believed it he
 

5257
01:41:52,750 --> 01:41:54,570
feature - he never really believed it he
actually believed in experts much less

5258
01:41:54,570 --> 01:41:54,580
actually believed in experts much less
 

5259
01:41:54,580 --> 01:41:58,379
actually believed in experts much less
than I believe in experts so Wow so

5260
01:41:58,379 --> 01:41:58,389
than I believe in experts so Wow so
 

5261
01:41:58,389 --> 01:42:00,540
than I believe in experts so Wow so
that's a fun that's a that's a

01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:02,650
fundamentally powerful property of ego
 

5265
01:42:02,650 --> 01:42:07,720
fundamentally powerful property of ego
and saying like not that I am wrong

5266
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:07,730
and saying like not that I am wrong

01:42:12,970 --> 01:42:12,980
telling me like when confronted with the
 

5271
01:42:12,980 --> 01:42:14,770
telling me like when confronted with the
fact that doesn't fit the thing that

you've really thought through sort of

5274
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:16,970
you've really thought through sort of
 

5275
01:42:16,970 --> 01:42:18,670
you've really thought through sort of
both the negative and the positive of

5276
01:42:18,670 --> 01:42:18,680
both the negative and the positive of
 

5277
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:22,720
both the negative and the positive of
ego you see the negative of that get in

5278
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:22,730
ego you see the negative of that get in
 

5279
01:42:22,730 --> 01:42:25,000
ego you see the negative of that get in
the way sort of be sure the Fronteras

the way sort of be sure the Fronteras
 

5281
01:42:25,010 --> 01:42:27,070
the way sort of be sure the Fronteras
mistakes I've made that are the results

5282
01:42:27,070 --> 01:42:27,080
mistakes I've made that are the results
 

5283

out I'm not I mean that's that's the you

5286
01:42:32,890 --> 01:42:32,900
out I'm not I mean that's that's the you
 

5287
01:42:32,900 --> 01:42:36,280
out I'm not I mean that's that's the you
know but but the thing is that the the

5288
01:42:36,280 --> 01:42:36,290
know but but the thing is that the the
 

5289
01:42:36,290 --> 01:42:38,890
know but but the thing is that the the
the idea that one tries to do things

5290
01:42:38,890 --> 01:42:38,900
the idea that one tries to do things
 

5291
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:41,620
the idea that one tries to do things
that so for example you know one

5292
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:41,630
that so for example you know one
 

5293
01:42:41,630 --> 01:42:43,270
that so for example you know one
question is if people have tried hard to

5294
01:42:43,270 --> 01:42:43,280
question is if people have tried hard to
 

5295
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:46,060
question is if people have tried hard to
do something and then one thinks maybe I

5296
01:42:46,060 --> 01:42:46,070
do something and then one thinks maybe I
 

5297
01:42:46,070 --> 01:42:48,190
do something and then one thinks maybe I
should try doing this myself

5298
01:42:48,190 --> 01:42:48,200
should try doing this myself
 

5299
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:50,500
should try doing this myself
if one does not have a certain degree of

5300
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:50,510
if one does not have a certain degree of
 

5301
01:42:50,510 --> 01:42:52,030
if one does not have a certain degree of
intellectual confidence one just says

5302
01:42:52,030 --> 01:42:52,040
intellectual confidence one just says
 

5303
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:53,140
intellectual confidence one just says
well people have been trying to do this

5304
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:53,150
well people have been trying to do this
 

5305
01:42:53,150 --> 01:42:54,910
well people have been trying to do this
for a hundred years how am I going to be

5306
01:42:54,910 --> 01:42:54,920
for a hundred years how am I going to be
 

5307
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:57,310
for a hundred years how am I going to be
able to do this yeah and you know I was

5308
01:42:57,310 --> 01:42:57,320
able to do this yeah and you know I was
 

5309
01:42:57,320 --> 01:42:59,410
able to do this yeah and you know I was
fortunate in the sense that I happen to

5310
01:42:59,410 --> 01:42:59,420
fortunate in the sense that I happen to
 

5311
01:42:59,420 --> 01:43:01,960
fortunate in the sense that I happen to
start having some degree of success in

5312
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:01,970
start having some degree of success in
 

5313
01:43:01,970 --> 01:43:03,160
start having some degree of success in
science and things when I was really

5314
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:03,170
science and things when I was really
 

5315
01:43:03,170 --> 01:43:05,560
science and things when I was really
young and so that developed a certain

5316
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:05,570
young and so that developed a certain
 

5317
01:43:05,570 --> 01:43:07,240
young and so that developed a certain
amounts of sort of intellectual

5318
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:07,250
amounts of sort of intellectual
 

5319
01:43:07,250 --> 01:43:08,440
amounts of sort of intellectual
confidence I don't think I otherwise

5320
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:08,450
confidence I don't think I otherwise
 

5321
01:43:08,450 --> 01:43:11,080
confidence I don't think I otherwise
would have had um and you know in a

5322
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:11,090
would have had um and you know in a
 

5323
01:43:11,090 --> 01:43:13,120
would have had um and you know in a
sense I mean I was fortunate that I was

5324
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:13,130
sense I mean I was fortunate that I was
 

5325
01:43:13,130 --> 01:43:15,100
sense I mean I was fortunate that I was
working in the field particle physics

5326
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:15,110
working in the field particle physics
 

5327
01:43:15,110 --> 01:43:18,250
working in the field particle physics
during it sort of Golden Age of rapid

5328
01:43:18,250 --> 01:43:18,260
during it sort of Golden Age of rapid
 

5329
01:43:18,260 --> 01:43:20,290
during it sort of Golden Age of rapid
progress and that that's kind of good on

5330
01:43:20,290 --> 01:43:20,300
progress and that that's kind of good on
 

5331
01:43:20,300 --> 01:43:22,630
progress and that that's kind of good on
a false sense of achievement because

5332
01:43:22,630 --> 01:43:22,640
a false sense of achievement because
 

5333
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:24,580
a false sense of achievement because
it's kind of kind of easy to discover

5334
01:43:24,580 --> 01:43:24,590
it's kind of kind of easy to discover
 

5335
01:43:24,590 --> 01:43:26,260
it's kind of kind of easy to discover
stuff that's gonna survive if you happen

5336
01:43:26,260 --> 01:43:26,270
stuff that's gonna survive if you happen
 

5337
01:43:26,270 --> 01:43:27,790
stuff that's gonna survive if you happen
to be you know picking the low-hanging

5338
01:43:27,790 --> 01:43:27,800
to be you know picking the low-hanging
 

5339
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:29,890

fruit of a rapidly expanding field I

5340
01:43:29,890 --> 01:43:29,900
fruit of a rapidly expanding field I
 

5341
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:32,500
fruit of a rapidly expanding field I
mean the reason I totally I totally

5342
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:32,510
mean the reason I totally I totally
 

5343
01:43:32,510 --> 01:43:34,720
mean the reason I totally I totally
immediately understood the ego behind a

5344
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:34,730
immediately understood the ego behind a
 

5345
01:43:34,730 --> 01:43:37,060
immediately understood the ego behind a
new kind of science to me let me sort of

5346
01:43:37,060 --> 01:43:37,070
new kind of science to me let me sort of
 

5347
01:43:37,070 --> 01:43:38,800
new kind of science to me let me sort of
just try to express my feelings and the

5348
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:38,810
just try to express my feelings and the
 

5349
01:43:38,810 --> 01:43:42,340
just try to express my feelings and the
whole thing is that if you don't allow

5350
01:43:42,340 --> 01:43:42,350
whole thing is that if you don't allow
 

5351
01:43:42,350 --> 01:43:44,800
whole thing is that if you don't allow
that kind of ego then you would never

5352
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:44,810
that kind of ego then you would never
 

5353
01:43:44,810 --> 01:43:47,800
that kind of ego then you would never
write that book that you would say well

5354
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:47,810
write that book that you would say well
 

5355
01:43:47,810 --> 01:43:49,390
write that book that you would say well
people must have done this there's not

5356
01:43:49,390 --> 01:43:49,400
people must have done this there's not
 

5357
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:51,280
people must have done this there's not
you would not dig you would not keep

5358
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:51,290
you would not dig you would not keep
 

5359
01:43:51,290 --> 01:43:55,420
you would not dig you would not keep
digging and I think that was I think you

5360
01:43:55,420 --> 01:43:55,430
digging and I think that was I think you
 

5361
01:43:55,430 --> 01:43:58,360
digging and I think that was I think you
have to take that ego and ride it and

5362
01:43:58,360 --> 01:43:58,370
have to take that ego and ride it and
 

5363
01:43:58,370 --> 01:44:00,310
have to take that ego and ride it and
see where it takes you in that and

5364
01:44:00,310 --> 01:44:00,320
see where it takes you in that and
 

5365
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:03,400
see where it takes you in that and
that's how you create exceptional work I

5366
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:03,410
that's how you create exceptional work I
 

5367
01:44:03,410 --> 01:44:05,440
that's how you create exceptional work I
think the other point about that book

5368
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:05,450
think the other point about that book
 

5369
01:44:05,450 --> 01:44:08,080
think the other point about that book
was it was a non-trivial question how to

5370
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:08,090
was it was a non-trivial question how to
 

5371
01:44:08,090 --> 01:44:10,300
was it was a non-trivial question how to
take a bunch of ideas that uh

5372
01:44:10,300 --> 01:44:10,310
take a bunch of ideas that uh
 

5373
01:44:10,310 --> 01:44:12,700
take a bunch of ideas that uh
I think reasonably big ideas they might

5374
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:12,710
I think reasonably big ideas they might
 

5375
01:44:12,710 --> 01:44:15,790
I think reasonably big ideas they might
you know their importance is determined

5376
01:44:15,790 --> 01:44:15,800
you know their importance is determined
 

5377
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:17,260
you know their importance is determined
by what happens historically one can't

5378
01:44:17,260 --> 01:44:17,270
by what happens historically one can't
 

5379
01:44:17,270 --> 01:44:18,790
by what happens historically one can't
tell how important they are one can tell

5380
01:44:18,790 --> 01:44:18,800
tell how important they are one can tell
 

5381
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,690
tell how important they are one can tell
sort of the scope of them

5382
01:44:20,690 --> 01:44:20,700
sort of the scope of them
 

5383
01:44:20,700 --> 01:44:23,390
sort of the scope of them
and the scope is fairly big and they're

5384
01:44:23,390 --> 01:44:23,400
and the scope is fairly big and they're
 

5385
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:25,310
and the scope is fairly big and they're
very different from things that have

5386
01:44:25,310 --> 01:44:25,320
very different from things that have
 

5387
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:26,840
very different from things that have
come before and the question is how do

5388
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:26,850
come before and the question is how do
 

5389
01:44:26,850 --> 01:44:29,270
come before and the question is how do
you explain that stuff to people and so

5390
01:44:29,270 --> 01:44:29,280
you explain that stuff to people and so
 

5391
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:31,610
you explain that stuff to people and so
I had had the experience of sort of

5392
01:44:31,610 --> 01:44:31,620
I had had the experience of sort of
 

5393
01:44:31,620 --> 01:44:33,350
I had had the experience of sort of
saying well there these things does a

5394
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:33,360
saying well there these things does a
 

5395
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:35,180
saying well there these things does a
cellular automaton it does this it does

5396
01:44:35,180 --> 01:44:35,190
cellular automaton it does this it does
 

5397
01:44:35,190 --> 01:44:37,250
cellular automaton it does this it does
that and people are like oh it must be

5398
01:44:37,250 --> 01:44:37,260
that and people are like oh it must be
 

5399
01:44:37,260 --> 01:44:38,900
that and people are like oh it must be
just like this it must be just like that

5400
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:38,910
just like this it must be just like that
 

5401
01:44:38,910 --> 01:44:41,210
just like this it must be just like that
say no it isn't it's something different

5402
01:44:41,210 --> 01:44:41,220
say no it isn't it's something different
 

5403
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:44,120
say no it isn't it's something different
right I said I could have done sort of

5404
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:44,130
right I said I could have done sort of
 

5405
01:44:44,130 --> 01:44:45,530
right I said I could have done sort of
I'm really glad you did what you did but

5406
01:44:45,530 --> 01:44:45,540
I'm really glad you did what you did but
 

5407
01:44:45,540 --> 01:44:46,310
I'm really glad you did what you did but
you could have done a sort of

5408
01:44:46,310 --> 01:44:46,320
you could have done a sort of
 

5409
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:48,290
you could have done a sort of
academically just publish keep

5410
01:44:48,290 --> 01:44:48,300
academically just publish keep
 

5411
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:50,270
academically just publish keep
publishing small papers here and there

5412
01:44:50,270 --> 01:44:50,280
publishing small papers here and there
 

5413
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:51,770
publishing small papers here and there
and then you would just keep getting

5414
01:44:51,770 --> 01:44:51,780
and then you would just keep getting
 

5415
01:44:51,780 --> 01:44:53,270
and then you would just keep getting
this kind of resistance right you would

5416
01:44:53,270 --> 01:44:53,280
this kind of resistance right you would
 

5417
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:55,280
this kind of resistance right you would
get like yeah it's supposed to just

5418
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:55,290
get like yeah it's supposed to just
 

5419
01:44:55,290 --> 01:44:57,980
get like yeah it's supposed to just
dropping a thing that says here it is

5420
01:44:57,980 --> 01:44:57,990
dropping a thing that says here it is
 

5421
01:44:57,990 --> 01:45:00,290
dropping a thing that says here it is
yeah here's like full the full thing no

5422
01:45:00,290 --> 01:45:00,300
yeah here's like full the full thing no
 

5423
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:01,610
yeah here's like full the full thing no
I mean that was my calculation is that

5424
01:45:01,610 --> 01:45:01,620
I mean that was my calculation is that
 

5425
01:45:01,620 --> 01:45:04,520
I mean that was my calculation is that
basically you know you could introduce

5426
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:04,530
basically you know you could introduce
 

5427
01:45:04,530 --> 01:45:06,950
basically you know you could introduce
little pieces it's like you know one

5428
01:45:06,950 --> 01:45:06,960
little pieces it's like you know one
 

5429
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:09,410
little pieces it's like you know one
possibility is like it's it's the secret

5430
01:45:09,410 --> 01:45:09,420
possibility is like it's it's the secret
 

5431
01:45:09,420 --> 01:45:11,060
possibility is like it's it's the secret
weapon so to speak it's this you know I

5432
01:45:11,060 --> 01:45:11,070
weapon so to speak it's this you know I
 

5433
01:45:11,070 --> 01:45:12,950
weapon so to speak it's this you know I
keep on an intraday you know discovering

5434
01:45:12,950 --> 01:45:12,960
keep on an intraday you know discovering
 

5435
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:13,730
keep on an intraday you know discovering
these things in all these different

5436
01:45:13,730 --> 01:45:13,740
these things in all these different
 

5437
01:45:13,740 --> 01:45:15,140
these things in all these different
areas where'd they come from

5438
01:45:15,140 --> 01:45:15,150
areas where'd they come from
 

5439
01:45:15,150 --> 01:45:17,810
areas where'd they come from
nobody knows but I decided that you know

5440
01:45:17,810 --> 01:45:17,820
nobody knows but I decided that you know
 

5441
01:45:17,820 --> 01:45:19,130
nobody knows but I decided that you know
in the interests of one only has one

5442
01:45:19,130 --> 01:45:19,140
in the interests of one only has one
 

5443
01:45:19,140 --> 01:45:21,710
in the interests of one only has one
life to lead and you know it the writing

5444
01:45:21,710 --> 01:45:21,720
life to lead and you know it the writing
 

5445
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:24,380
life to lead and you know it the writing
that book took me a decade anyway it's

5446
01:45:24,380 --> 01:45:24,390
that book took me a decade anyway it's
 

5447
01:45:24,390 --> 01:45:25,880
that book took me a decade anyway it's
not there's not a lot of wiggle room so

5448
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:25,890
not there's not a lot of wiggle room so
 

5449
01:45:25,890 --> 01:45:27,830
not there's not a lot of wiggle room so
to speak one can't be wrong by a factor

5450
01:45:27,830 --> 01:45:27,840
to speak one can't be wrong by a factor
 

5451
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:29,240
to speak one can't be wrong by a factor
of three he said is peeking how long

5452
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:29,250
of three he said is peeking how long
 

5453
01:45:29,250 --> 01:45:31,730
of three he said is peeking how long
it's going to take that I you know I

5454
01:45:31,730 --> 01:45:31,740
it's going to take that I you know I
 

5455
01:45:31,740 --> 01:45:34,340
it's going to take that I you know I
thought the best thing to do the thing

5456
01:45:34,340 --> 01:45:34,350
thought the best thing to do the thing
 

5457
01:45:34,350 --> 01:45:38,930
thought the best thing to do the thing
that is most sort of that most respects

5458
01:45:38,930 --> 01:45:38,940
that is most sort of that most respects
 

5459
01:45:38,940 --> 01:45:41,810
that is most sort of that most respects
the the intellectual content so to speak

5460
01:45:41,810 --> 01:45:41,820
the the intellectual content so to speak
 

5461
01:45:41,820 --> 01:45:44,420
the the intellectual content so to speak
is you just put it out with as much

5462
01:45:44,420 --> 01:45:44,430
is you just put it out with as much
 

5463
01:45:44,430 --> 01:45:46,430
is you just put it out with as much
force as you can because it's not

5464
01:45:46,430 --> 01:45:46,440
force as you can because it's not
 

5465
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:48,830
force as you can because it's not
something where and you know it's an

5466
01:45:48,830 --> 01:45:48,840
something where and you know it's an
 

5467
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:50,480
something where and you know it's an
interesting thing you talk about ego and

5468
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:50,490
interesting thing you talk about ego and
 

5469
01:45:50,490 --> 01:45:52,610
interesting thing you talk about ego and
it's it's you know for example I run a

5470
01:45:52,610 --> 01:45:52,620
it's it's you know for example I run a
 

5471
01:45:52,620 --> 01:45:55,280
it's it's you know for example I run a
company which has my name on it right I

5472
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:55,290
company which has my name on it right I
 

5473
01:45:55,290 --> 01:45:57,710
company which has my name on it right I
I thought about starting a club people

5474
01:45:57,710 --> 01:45:57,720
I thought about starting a club people
 

5475
01:45:57,720 --> 01:45:59,510
I thought about starting a club people
whose companies have their names on them

5476
01:45:59,510 --> 01:45:59,520
whose companies have their names on them
 

5477
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,310
whose companies have their names on them
and it's it's a funny group because

5478
01:46:01,310 --> 01:46:01,320
and it's it's a funny group because
 

5479
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:03,500
and it's it's a funny group because
we're not a bunch of ego maniacs that's

5480
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:03,510
we're not a bunch of ego maniacs that's
 

5481
01:46:03,510 --> 01:46:05,870
we're not a bunch of ego maniacs that's
not what it's about so to speak it's

5482
01:46:05,870 --> 01:46:05,880
not what it's about so to speak it's
 

5483
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:08,060
not what it's about so to speak it's
about basically sort of taking

5484
01:46:08,060 --> 01:46:08,070
about basically sort of taking
 

5485
01:46:08,070 --> 01:46:10,040
about basically sort of taking
responsibility for what one's doing and

5486
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:10,050
responsibility for what one's doing and
 

5487
01:46:10,050 --> 01:46:13,070
responsibility for what one's doing and
you know in a sense any of these things

5488
01:46:13,070 --> 01:46:13,080
you know in a sense any of these things
 

5489
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:14,810
you know in a sense any of these things
where you're sort of putting yourself on

5490
01:46:14,810 --> 01:46:14,820
where you're sort of putting yourself on
 

5491
01:46:14,820 --> 01:46:21,230
where you're sort of putting yourself on
the line it's it's kind of a funny it's

5492
01:46:21,230 --> 01:46:21,240
the line it's it's kind of a funny it's
 

5493
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:24,650
the line it's it's kind of a funny it's
a funny dynamic because in a sense my

5494
01:46:24,650 --> 01:46:24,660
a funny dynamic because in a sense my
 

5495
01:46:24,660 --> 01:46:26,540
a funny dynamic because in a sense my
company is sort of something that

5496
01:46:26,540 --> 01:46:26,550
company is sort of something that
 

5497
01:46:26,550 --> 01:46:28,340
company is sort of something that
happens to have my name on it but it's

5498
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:28,350
happens to have my name on it but it's
 

5499
01:46:28,350 --> 01:46:29,960
happens to have my name on it but it's
kind of bigger than me and I'm kind of

5500
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:29,970
kind of bigger than me and I'm kind of
 

5501
01:46:29,970 --> 01:46:32,630
kind of bigger than me and I'm kind of
just its mascot at some level I mean I

5502
01:46:32,630 --> 01:46:32,640
just its mascot at some level I mean I
 

5503
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:34,459
just its mascot at some level I mean I
also happen to be a pretty

5504
01:46:34,459 --> 01:46:34,469
also happen to be a pretty
 

5505
01:46:34,469 --> 01:46:37,100
also happen to be a pretty
you know strong leader of it but but

5506
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:37,110
you know strong leader of it but but
 

5507
01:46:37,110 --> 01:46:41,049
you know strong leader of it but but
it's basically showing a deep

5508
01:46:41,049 --> 01:46:41,059
it's basically showing a deep
 

5509
01:46:41,059 --> 01:46:45,080
it's basically showing a deep
inextricable sort of investment the same

5510
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:45,090
inextricable sort of investment the same
 

5511
01:46:45,090 --> 01:46:47,239
inextricable sort of investment the same
your name like Steve Jobs his name

5512
01:46:47,239 --> 01:46:47,249
your name like Steve Jobs his name
 

5513
01:46:47,249 --> 01:46:52,969
your name like Steve Jobs his name
wasn't on Apple but he was Apple yes

5514
01:46:52,969 --> 01:46:52,979
wasn't on Apple but he was Apple yes
 

5515
01:46:52,979 --> 01:46:56,359
wasn't on Apple but he was Apple yes
Elon Musk's name is not on Tesla but he

5516
01:46:56,359 --> 01:46:56,369
Elon Musk's name is not on Tesla but he
 

5517
01:46:56,369 --> 01:46:58,790
Elon Musk's name is not on Tesla but he
is Tesla so it's like a meaning

5518
01:46:58,790 --> 01:46:58,800
is Tesla so it's like a meaning
 

5519
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:01,489
is Tesla so it's like a meaning
emotionally his company succeeds or

5520
01:47:01,489 --> 01:47:01,499
emotionally his company succeeds or
 

5521
01:47:01,499 --> 01:47:03,680
emotionally his company succeeds or
fails he would just that emotionally

5522
01:47:03,680 --> 01:47:03,690
fails he would just that emotionally
 

5523
01:47:03,690 --> 01:47:06,560
fails he would just that emotionally
would suffer through that and so that's

5524
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:06,570
would suffer through that and so that's
 

5525
01:47:06,570 --> 01:47:09,200
would suffer through that and so that's
that's did recognizing that fact tonight

5526
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:09,210
that's did recognizing that fact tonight
 

5527
01:47:09,210 --> 01:47:10,819
that's did recognizing that fact tonight
and also wolf form is a pretty good

5528
01:47:10,819 --> 01:47:10,829
and also wolf form is a pretty good
 

5529
01:47:10,829 --> 01:47:14,479
and also wolf form is a pretty good
branding name so that works up I think

5530
01:47:14,479 --> 01:47:14,489
branding name so that works up I think
 

5531
01:47:14,489 --> 01:47:16,640
branding name so that works up I think
Steve had it had a bad deal there yeah

5532
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:16,650
Steve had it had a bad deal there yeah
 

5533
01:47:16,650 --> 01:47:18,709
Steve had it had a bad deal there yeah
so you you've made up for it with the

5534
01:47:18,709 --> 01:47:18,719
so you you've made up for it with the
 

5535
01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:23,120
so you you've made up for it with the
last name okay so so in 2002 you

5536
01:47:23,120 --> 01:47:23,130
last name okay so so in 2002 you
 

5537
01:47:23,130 --> 01:47:26,709
last name okay so so in 2002 you
published a new kind of science to which

5538
01:47:26,709 --> 01:47:26,719
published a new kind of science to which
 

5539
01:47:26,719 --> 01:47:29,390
published a new kind of science to which
sort of on a personal level I can credit

5540
01:47:29,390 --> 01:47:29,400
sort of on a personal level I can credit
 

5541
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:31,040
sort of on a personal level I can credit
my love for cellular automata and

5542
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:31,050
my love for cellular automata and
 

5543
01:47:31,050 --> 01:47:34,040
my love for cellular automata and
computation in general I think a lot of

5544
01:47:34,040 --> 01:47:34,050
computation in general I think a lot of
 

5545
01:47:34,050 --> 01:47:36,169
computation in general I think a lot of
others can as well can you briefly

5546
01:47:36,169 --> 01:47:36,179
others can as well can you briefly
 

5547
01:47:36,179 --> 01:47:42,649
others can as well can you briefly
describe the vision the hope the main

5548
01:47:42,649 --> 01:47:42,659
describe the vision the hope the main
 

5549
01:47:42,659 --> 01:47:45,290
describe the vision the hope the main
idea presented in this twelve hundred

5550
01:47:45,290 --> 01:47:45,300
idea presented in this twelve hundred
 

5551
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:48,680
idea presented in this twelve hundred
page book sure although it took twelve

5552
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:48,690
page book sure although it took twelve
 

5553
01:47:48,690 --> 01:47:51,080
page book sure although it took twelve
hundred pages to say in the book so know

5554
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:51,090
hundred pages to say in the book so know
 

5555
01:47:51,090 --> 01:47:54,290
hundred pages to say in the book so know
that the the real idea it's kind of a

5556
01:47:54,290 --> 01:47:54,300
that the the real idea it's kind of a
 

5557
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:56,689
that the the real idea it's kind of a
good way to get into it is to look at

5558
01:47:56,689 --> 01:47:56,699
good way to get into it is to look at
 

5559
01:47:56,699 --> 01:47:58,279
good way to get into it is to look at
sort of the arc of history and to look

5560
01:47:58,279 --> 01:47:58,289
sort of the arc of history and to look
 

5561
01:47:58,289 --> 01:47:59,390
sort of the arc of history and to look
at what's happened in kind of the

5562
01:47:59,390 --> 01:47:59,400
at what's happened in kind of the
 

5563
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:01,370
at what's happened in kind of the
developments of science I mean there was

5564
01:48:01,370 --> 01:48:01,380
developments of science I mean there was
 

5565
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:04,129
developments of science I mean there was
this sort of big idea in science about

5566
01:48:04,129 --> 01:48:04,139
this sort of big idea in science about
 

5567
01:48:04,139 --> 01:48:07,459
this sort of big idea in science about
three hundred years ago that was let's

5568
01:48:07,459 --> 01:48:07,469
three hundred years ago that was let's
 

5569
01:48:07,469 --> 01:48:09,259
three hundred years ago that was let's
use mathematical equations to try and

5570
01:48:09,259 --> 01:48:09,269
use mathematical equations to try and
 

5571
01:48:09,269 --> 01:48:11,540
use mathematical equations to try and
describe things in the world let's use

5572
01:48:11,540 --> 01:48:11,550
describe things in the world let's use
 

5573
01:48:11,550 --> 01:48:14,029
describe things in the world let's use
sort of the formal idea of mathematical

5574
01:48:14,029 --> 01:48:14,039
sort of the formal idea of mathematical
 

5575
01:48:14,039 --> 01:48:15,830
sort of the formal idea of mathematical
equations to describe what might be

5576
01:48:15,830 --> 01:48:15,840
equations to describe what might be
 

5577
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:17,660
equations to describe what might be
happening in the world rather than for

5578
01:48:17,660 --> 01:48:17,670
happening in the world rather than for
 

5579
01:48:17,670 --> 01:48:19,549
happening in the world rather than for
example just using sort of logical

5580
01:48:19,549 --> 01:48:19,559
example just using sort of logical
 

5581
01:48:19,559 --> 01:48:21,439
example just using sort of logical
augmentation and so on let's have a a

5582
01:48:21,439 --> 01:48:21,449
augmentation and so on let's have a a
 

5583
01:48:21,449 --> 01:48:24,259
augmentation and so on let's have a a
formal theory about that and so they've

5584
01:48:24,259 --> 01:48:24,269
formal theory about that and so they've
 

5585
01:48:24,269 --> 01:48:25,910
formal theory about that and so they've
been this three hundred year run of

5586
01:48:25,910 --> 01:48:25,920
been this three hundred year run of
 

5587
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:27,620
been this three hundred year run of
using mathematical equations to describe

5588
01:48:27,620 --> 01:48:27,630
using mathematical equations to describe
 

5589
01:48:27,630 --> 01:48:28,910
using mathematical equations to describe
the natural world which would work

5590
01:48:28,910 --> 01:48:28,920
the natural world which would work
 

5591
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:32,089
the natural world which would work
pretty well but I got interested in how

5592
01:48:32,089 --> 01:48:32,099
pretty well but I got interested in how
 

5593
01:48:32,099 --> 01:48:34,640
pretty well but I got interested in how
one could generalize that notion you

5594
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:34,650
one could generalize that notion you
 

5595
01:48:34,650 --> 01:48:36,169
one could generalize that notion you
know there is a formal theory there are

5596
01:48:36,169 --> 01:48:36,179
know there is a formal theory there are
 

5597
01:48:36,179 --> 01:48:38,660
know there is a formal theory there are
definite rules but what structure could

5598
01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:38,670
definite rules but what structure could
 

5599
01:48:38,670 --> 01:48:41,029
definite rules but what structure could
those rules have and so what I got

5600
01:48:41,029 --> 01:48:41,039
those rules have and so what I got
 

5601
01:48:41,039 --> 01:48:43,129
those rules have and so what I got
interested in was let's generalize

5602
01:48:43,129 --> 01:48:43,139
interested in was let's generalize
 

5603
01:48:43,139 --> 01:48:45,109
interested in was let's generalize
beyond the sort of purely mathematical

5604
01:48:45,109 --> 01:48:45,119
beyond the sort of purely mathematical
 

5605
01:48:45,119 --> 01:48:47,650
beyond the sort of purely mathematical
rules and we now have this sort of

5606
01:48:47,650 --> 01:48:47,660
rules and we now have this sort of
 

5607
01:48:47,660 --> 01:48:49,840
rules and we now have this sort of
ocean of programming and computing and

5608
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:49,850
ocean of programming and computing and
 

5609
01:48:49,850 --> 01:48:53,140
ocean of programming and computing and
so on let's use the kinds of rules that

5610
01:48:53,140 --> 01:48:53,150
so on let's use the kinds of rules that
 

5611
01:48:53,150 --> 01:48:56,290
so on let's use the kinds of rules that
can be embodied in programs to has a

5612
01:48:56,290 --> 01:48:56,300
can be embodied in programs to has a
 

5613
01:48:56,300 --> 01:48:57,970
can be embodied in programs to has a
sort of generalization of the ones that

5614
01:48:57,970 --> 01:48:57,980
sort of generalization of the ones that
 

5615
01:48:57,980 --> 01:49:00,160
sort of generalization of the ones that
can exist in mathematics as a way to

5616
01:49:00,160 --> 01:49:00,170
can exist in mathematics as a way to
 

5617
01:49:00,170 --> 01:49:03,640
can exist in mathematics as a way to
describe the world and so my kind of

5618
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:03,650
describe the world and so my kind of
 

5619
01:49:03,650 --> 01:49:05,530
describe the world and so my kind of
favorite version of these kinds of

5620
01:49:05,530 --> 01:49:05,540
favorite version of these kinds of
 

5621
01:49:05,540 --> 01:49:07,960
favorite version of these kinds of
simple rules are these things called

5622
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:07,970
simple rules are these things called
 

5623
01:49:07,970 --> 01:49:10,060
simple rules are these things called
cellular automata and so typical case

5624
01:49:10,060 --> 01:49:10,070
cellular automata and so typical case
 

5625
01:49:10,070 --> 01:49:14,140
cellular automata and so typical case
shall we what are cellular automata fair

5626
01:49:14,140 --> 01:49:14,150
shall we what are cellular automata fair
 

5627
01:49:14,150 --> 01:49:16,270
shall we what are cellular automata fair
enough so typical case of a cellular

5628
01:49:16,270 --> 01:49:16,280
enough so typical case of a cellular
 

5629
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:19,540
enough so typical case of a cellular
automaton it's an array of cells it's

5630
01:49:19,540 --> 01:49:19,550
automaton it's an array of cells it's
 

5631
01:49:19,550 --> 01:49:23,590
automaton it's an array of cells it's
just a line of discrete cells each cell

5632
01:49:23,590 --> 01:49:23,600
just a line of discrete cells each cell
 

5633
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:26,680
just a line of discrete cells each cell
is either black or white and in a series

5634
01:49:26,680 --> 01:49:26,690
is either black or white and in a series
 

5635
01:49:26,690 --> 01:49:29,080
is either black or white and in a series
of steps you can represent as lines

5636
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:29,090
of steps you can represent as lines
 

5637
01:49:29,090 --> 01:49:31,480
of steps you can represent as lines
going down a page you're updating the

5638
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:31,490
going down a page you're updating the
 

5639
01:49:31,490 --> 01:49:33,430
going down a page you're updating the
color of each cell according to a rule

5640
01:49:33,430 --> 01:49:33,440
color of each cell according to a rule
 

5641
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:35,290
color of each cell according to a rule
that depends on the color of the cell

5642
01:49:35,290 --> 01:49:35,300
that depends on the color of the cell
 

5643
01:49:35,300 --> 01:49:37,300
that depends on the color of the cell
above it and to its left and right so

5644
01:49:37,300 --> 01:49:37,310
above it and to its left and right so
 

5645
01:49:37,310 --> 01:49:39,460
above it and to its left and right so
it's really simple so a thing might be

5646
01:49:39,460 --> 01:49:39,470
it's really simple so a thing might be
 

5647
01:49:39,470 --> 01:49:43,690
it's really simple so a thing might be
you know if the cell on its right

5648
01:49:43,690 --> 01:49:43,700
you know if the cell on its right
 

5649
01:49:43,700 --> 01:49:50,170
you know if the cell on its right
neighbor are not the same and or the

5650
01:49:50,170 --> 01:49:50,180
neighbor are not the same and or the
 

5651
01:49:50,180 --> 01:49:53,380
neighbor are not the same and or the
cell on the left is is is black or

5652
01:49:53,380 --> 01:49:53,390
cell on the left is is is black or
 

5653
01:49:53,390 --> 01:49:55,420
cell on the left is is is black or
something then make it back on the next

5654
01:49:55,420 --> 01:49:55,430
something then make it back on the next
 

5655
01:49:55,430 --> 01:49:58,270
something then make it back on the next
step and if not make it white typical

5656
01:49:58,270 --> 01:49:58,280
step and if not make it white typical
 

5657
01:49:58,280 --> 01:50:01,480
step and if not make it white typical
rule um that rule I'm not sure I said it

5658
01:50:01,480 --> 01:50:01,490
rule um that rule I'm not sure I said it
 

5659
01:50:01,490 --> 01:50:03,250
rule um that rule I'm not sure I said it
exactly right but a rule very much like

5660
01:50:03,250 --> 01:50:03,260
exactly right but a rule very much like
 

5661
01:50:03,260 --> 01:50:05,590
exactly right but a rule very much like
what I just said has the feature that if

5662
01:50:05,590 --> 01:50:05,600
what I just said has the feature that if
 

5663
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:07,510
what I just said has the feature that if
you started off from just one black cell

5664
01:50:07,510 --> 01:50:07,520
you started off from just one black cell
 

5665
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:09,220
you started off from just one black cell
at the top it makes this extremely

5666
01:50:09,220 --> 01:50:09,230
at the top it makes this extremely
 

5667
01:50:09,230 --> 01:50:12,790
at the top it makes this extremely
complicated pattern so some rules you

5668
01:50:12,790 --> 01:50:12,800
complicated pattern so some rules you
 

5669
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:15,940
complicated pattern so some rules you
get a very simple pattern some rules you

5670
01:50:15,940 --> 01:50:15,950
get a very simple pattern some rules you
 

5671
01:50:15,950 --> 01:50:19,000
get a very simple pattern some rules you
have the rule is simple you start them

5672
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:19,010
have the rule is simple you start them
 

5673
01:50:19,010 --> 01:50:21,100
have the rule is simple you start them
off from a sort of simple seed you just

5674
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:21,110
off from a sort of simple seed you just
 

5675
01:50:21,110 --> 01:50:23,440
off from a sort of simple seed you just
get this very simple pattern but other

5676
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:23,450
get this very simple pattern but other
 

5677
01:50:23,450 --> 01:50:26,080
get this very simple pattern but other
rules and this was the big surprise when

5678
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:26,090
rules and this was the big surprise when
 

5679
01:50:26,090 --> 01:50:28,060
rules and this was the big surprise when
I started actually just doing the simple

5680
01:50:28,060 --> 01:50:28,070
I started actually just doing the simple
 

5681
01:50:28,070 --> 01:50:29,320
I started actually just doing the simple
computer experiments to find out what

5682
01:50:29,320 --> 01:50:29,330
computer experiments to find out what
 

5683
01:50:29,330 --> 01:50:32,170
computer experiments to find out what
happens is that they produce very

5684
01:50:32,170 --> 01:50:32,180
happens is that they produce very
 

5685
01:50:32,180 --> 01:50:34,090
happens is that they produce very
complicated patterns of behavior so for

5686
01:50:34,090 --> 01:50:34,100
complicated patterns of behavior so for
 

5687
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:37,960
complicated patterns of behavior so for
example its rule 30 rule has the feature

5688
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:37,970
example its rule 30 rule has the feature
 

5689
01:50:37,970 --> 01:50:39,640
example its rule 30 rule has the feature
you start from just one black cell at

5690
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:39,650
you start from just one black cell at
 

5691
01:50:39,650 --> 01:50:42,700
you start from just one black cell at
the top makes this very random pattern

5692
01:50:42,700 --> 01:50:42,710
the top makes this very random pattern
 

5693
01:50:42,710 --> 01:50:45,400
the top makes this very random pattern
if you look like at the center column of

5694
01:50:45,400 --> 01:50:45,410
if you look like at the center column of
 

5695
01:50:45,410 --> 01:50:48,610
if you look like at the center column of
cells you get a series of values you

5696
01:50:48,610 --> 01:50:48,620
cells you get a series of values you
 

5697
01:50:48,620 --> 01:50:50,170
cells you get a series of values you
know it goes back white black black

5698
01:50:50,170 --> 01:50:50,180
know it goes back white black black
 

5699
01:50:50,180 --> 01:50:53,530
know it goes back white black black
whatever it is that sequence seems for

5700
01:50:53,530 --> 01:50:53,540
whatever it is that sequence seems for
 

5701
01:50:53,540 --> 01:50:57,070
whatever it is that sequence seems for
all practical purposes random so it's

5702
01:50:57,070 --> 01:50:57,080
all practical purposes random so it's
 

5703
01:50:57,080 --> 01:50:59,200
all practical purposes random so it's
kind of like in in math you know you can

5704
01:50:59,200 --> 01:50:59,210
kind of like in in math you know you can
 

5705
01:50:59,210 --> 01:51:00,940
kind of like in in math you know you can
put the digits of pi 3

5706
01:51:00,940 --> 01:51:00,950
put the digits of pi 3
 

5707
01:51:00,950 --> 01:51:02,970
put the digits of pi 3
one four one five nine two six whatever

5708
01:51:02,970 --> 01:51:02,980
one four one five nine two six whatever
 

5709
01:51:02,980 --> 01:51:06,250
one four one five nine two six whatever
those digits once computed I mean that

5710
01:51:06,250 --> 01:51:06,260
those digits once computed I mean that
 

5711
01:51:06,260 --> 01:51:07,960
those digits once computed I mean that
the scheme for computing pi you know

5712
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:07,970
the scheme for computing pi you know
 

5713
01:51:07,970 --> 01:51:09,340
the scheme for computing pi you know
it's the ratio of the circumference to

5714
01:51:09,340 --> 01:51:09,350
it's the ratio of the circumference to
 

5715
01:51:09,350 --> 01:51:10,810
it's the ratio of the circumference to
the diameter of a circle very

5716
01:51:10,810 --> 01:51:10,820
the diameter of a circle very
 

5717
01:51:10,820 --> 01:51:14,470
the diameter of a circle very
well-defined but yet when you are once

5718
01:51:14,470 --> 01:51:14,480
well-defined but yet when you are once
 

5719
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:16,360
well-defined but yet when you are once
you've generated those digits they seem

5720
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:16,370
you've generated those digits they seem
 

5721
01:51:16,370 --> 01:51:17,860
you've generated those digits they seem
for all practical purposes completely

5722
01:51:17,860 --> 01:51:17,870
for all practical purposes completely
 

5723
01:51:17,870 --> 01:51:21,430
for all practical purposes completely
random and so it is with rule 30 that

5724
01:51:21,430 --> 01:51:21,440
random and so it is with rule 30 that
 

5725
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:23,320
random and so it is with rule 30 that
even though the rule is very simple much

5726
01:51:23,320 --> 01:51:23,330
even though the rule is very simple much
 

5727
01:51:23,330 --> 01:51:25,180
even though the rule is very simple much
simpler much more sort of

5728
01:51:25,180 --> 01:51:25,190
simpler much more sort of
 

5729
01:51:25,190 --> 01:51:27,580
simpler much more sort of
computationally obvious than the rule

5730
01:51:27,580 --> 01:51:27,590
computationally obvious than the rule
 

5731
01:51:27,590 --> 01:51:29,860
computationally obvious than the rule
for generating digits of pi even with a

5732
01:51:29,860 --> 01:51:29,870
for generating digits of pi even with a
 

5733
01:51:29,870 --> 01:51:32,170
for generating digits of pi even with a
rule that simple you're still generating

5734
01:51:32,170 --> 01:51:32,180
rule that simple you're still generating
 

5735
01:51:32,180 --> 01:51:34,510
rule that simple you're still generating
immensely complicated behavior yeah so

5736
01:51:34,510 --> 01:51:34,520
immensely complicated behavior yeah so
 

5737
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:36,190
immensely complicated behavior yeah so
if we could just pause on that I think

5738
01:51:36,190 --> 01:51:36,200
if we could just pause on that I think
 

5739
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:38,500
if we could just pause on that I think
you you probably said it and looked at

5740
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:38,510
you you probably said it and looked at
 

5741
01:51:38,510 --> 01:51:40,780
you you probably said it and looked at
it so long you forgot the magic of it or

5742
01:51:40,780 --> 01:51:40,790
it so long you forgot the magic of it or
 

5743
01:51:40,790 --> 01:51:42,220
it so long you forgot the magic of it or
perhaps you know you still feel the

5744
01:51:42,220 --> 01:51:42,230
perhaps you know you still feel the
 

5745
01:51:42,230 --> 01:51:45,160
perhaps you know you still feel the
magic but to me if you've never seen

5746
01:51:45,160 --> 01:51:45,170
magic but to me if you've never seen
 

5747
01:51:45,170 --> 01:51:48,520
magic but to me if you've never seen
sort of I would say what is it a one

5748
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:48,530
sort of I would say what is it a one
 

5749
01:51:48,530 --> 01:51:51,310
sort of I would say what is it a one
dimensional essentially another automata

5750
01:51:51,310 --> 01:51:51,320
dimensional essentially another automata
 

5751
01:51:51,320 --> 01:51:54,580
dimensional essentially another automata
right and and you were to guess what you

5752
01:51:54,580 --> 01:51:54,590
right and and you were to guess what you
 

5753
01:51:54,590 --> 01:52:00,700
right and and you were to guess what you
would see if you have some so cells that

5754
01:52:00,700 --> 01:52:00,710
would see if you have some so cells that
 

5755
01:52:00,710 --> 01:52:04,510
would see if you have some so cells that
only respond to its neighbors right if

5756
01:52:04,510 --> 01:52:04,520
only respond to its neighbors right if
 

5757
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:06,190
only respond to its neighbors right if
you were to guess what kind of things

5758
01:52:06,190 --> 01:52:06,200
you were to guess what kind of things
 

5759
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:09,820
you were to guess what kind of things
you would see like my my initial guess

5760
01:52:09,820 --> 01:52:09,830
you would see like my my initial guess
 

5761
01:52:09,830 --> 01:52:11,710
you would see like my my initial guess
like even when I first like open your

5762
01:52:11,710 --> 01:52:11,720
like even when I first like open your
 

5763
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:14,470
like even when I first like open your
book a new kind of science right - your

5764
01:52:14,470 --> 01:52:14,480
book a new kind of science right - your
 

5765
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:16,720
book a new kind of science right - your
guess is you would see I mean it would

5766
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:16,730
guess is you would see I mean it would
 

5767
01:52:16,730 --> 01:52:21,070
guess is you would see I mean it would
be a very simple stuff like and I think

5768
01:52:21,070 --> 01:52:21,080
be a very simple stuff like and I think
 

5769
01:52:21,080 --> 01:52:23,740
be a very simple stuff like and I think
it's a magical experience to realize the

5770
01:52:23,740 --> 01:52:23,750
it's a magical experience to realize the
 

5771
01:52:23,750 --> 01:52:25,680
it's a magical experience to realize the
kind of complex you mentioned rule 30

5772
01:52:25,680 --> 01:52:25,690
kind of complex you mentioned rule 30
 

5773
01:52:25,690 --> 01:52:28,690
kind of complex you mentioned rule 30
still your favorite cellular automaton

5774
01:52:28,690 --> 01:52:28,700
still your favorite cellular automaton
 

5775
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:32,050
still your favorite cellular automaton
oh my favorite rule yes it you get

5776
01:52:32,050 --> 01:52:32,060
oh my favorite rule yes it you get
 

5777
01:52:32,060 --> 01:52:34,810
oh my favorite rule yes it you get
complexity immense complexity you get

5778
01:52:34,810 --> 01:52:34,820
complexity immense complexity you get
 

5779
01:52:34,820 --> 01:52:37,540
complexity immense complexity you get
arbitrary complexity yes and when you

5780
01:52:37,540 --> 01:52:37,550
arbitrary complexity yes and when you
 

5781
01:52:37,550 --> 01:52:39,750
arbitrary complexity yes and when you
say randomness down the middle column

5782
01:52:39,750 --> 01:52:39,760
say randomness down the middle column
 

5783
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:44,350
say randomness down the middle column
you know that's just what one cool way

5784
01:52:44,350 --> 01:52:44,360
you know that's just what one cool way
 

5785
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:45,760
you know that's just what one cool way
to say that there's incredible

5786
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:45,770
to say that there's incredible
 

5787
01:52:45,770 --> 01:52:49,330
to say that there's incredible
complexity and that's just the gist I

5788
01:52:49,330 --> 01:52:49,340
complexity and that's just the gist I
 

5789
01:52:49,340 --> 01:52:51,400
complexity and that's just the gist I
mean that's a magical idea however you

5790
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:51,410
mean that's a magical idea however you
 

5791
01:52:51,410 --> 01:52:52,570
mean that's a magical idea however you
start to interpret it all the

5792
01:52:52,570 --> 01:52:52,580
start to interpret it all the
 

5793
01:52:52,580 --> 01:52:54,910
start to interpret it all the
reducibility discussions all that but

5794
01:52:54,910 --> 01:52:54,920
reducibility discussions all that but
 

5795
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:57,070
reducibility discussions all that but
it's just I think that has profound

5796
01:52:57,070 --> 01:52:57,080
it's just I think that has profound
 

5797
01:52:57,080 --> 01:53:01,450
it's just I think that has profound
philosophical kind of notions around it

5798
01:53:01,450 --> 01:53:01,460
philosophical kind of notions around it
 

5799
01:53:01,460 --> 01:53:03,430
philosophical kind of notions around it
- it's not just well you know I mean

5800
01:53:03,430 --> 01:53:03,440
- it's not just well you know I mean
 

5801
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:05,140
- it's not just well you know I mean
this transformation about how you see

5802
01:53:05,140 --> 01:53:05,150
this transformation about how you see
 

5803
01:53:05,150 --> 01:53:06,370
this transformation about how you see
the world I think for me was

5804
01:53:06,370 --> 01:53:06,380
the world I think for me was
 

5805
01:53:06,380 --> 01:53:08,500
the world I think for me was
transformational I don't know we can

5806
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:08,510
transformational I don't know we can
 

5807
01:53:08,510 --> 01:53:10,180
transformational I don't know we can
what it can have all kinds of discussion

5808
01:53:10,180 --> 01:53:10,190
what it can have all kinds of discussion
 

5809
01:53:10,190 --> 01:53:13,210
what it can have all kinds of discussion
about computation and so on but just you

5810
01:53:13,210 --> 01:53:13,220
about computation and so on but just you
 

5811
01:53:13,220 --> 01:53:14,300
about computation and so on but just you
know I

5812
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:14,310
know I
 

5813
01:53:14,310 --> 01:53:16,580
know I
and sometimes think if I were on a

5814
01:53:16,580 --> 01:53:16,590
and sometimes think if I were on a
 

5815
01:53:16,590 --> 01:53:21,260
and sometimes think if I were on a
desert island and was I don't know maybe

5816
01:53:21,260 --> 01:53:21,270
desert island and was I don't know maybe
 

5817
01:53:21,270 --> 01:53:22,670
desert island and was I don't know maybe
it was some psychedelics or something

5818
01:53:22,670 --> 01:53:22,680
it was some psychedelics or something
 

5819
01:53:22,680 --> 01:53:25,100
it was some psychedelics or something
but if I had to take one book any new

5820
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:25,110
but if I had to take one book any new
 

5821
01:53:25,110 --> 01:53:26,360
but if I had to take one book any new
kind of science would be a because you

5822
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:26,370
kind of science would be a because you
 

5823
01:53:26,370 --> 01:53:29,690
kind of science would be a because you
just enjoy that notion for some reason

5824
01:53:29,690 --> 01:53:29,700
just enjoy that notion for some reason
 

5825
01:53:29,700 --> 01:53:31,760
just enjoy that notion for some reason
it's a deeply profound notion at least

5826
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:31,770
it's a deeply profound notion at least
 

5827
01:53:31,770 --> 01:53:33,500
it's a deeply profound notion at least
to me I find it that way yeah I mean

5828
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:33,510
to me I find it that way yeah I mean
 

5829
01:53:33,510 --> 01:53:37,700
to me I find it that way yeah I mean
look it's been it was a very intuition

5830
01:53:37,700 --> 01:53:37,710
look it's been it was a very intuition
 

5831
01:53:37,710 --> 01:53:41,030
look it's been it was a very intuition
breaking thing to discover I mean it's

5832
01:53:41,030 --> 01:53:41,040
breaking thing to discover I mean it's
 

5833
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:43,940
breaking thing to discover I mean it's
kind of like you know you you point the

5834
01:53:43,940 --> 01:53:43,950
kind of like you know you you point the
 

5835
01:53:43,950 --> 01:53:45,740
kind of like you know you you point the
computational telescope out there and

5836
01:53:45,740 --> 01:53:45,750
computational telescope out there and
 

5837
01:53:45,750 --> 01:53:48,290
computational telescope out there and
suddenly you see I don't know you know

5838
01:53:48,290 --> 01:53:48,300
suddenly you see I don't know you know
 

5839
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:50,420
suddenly you see I don't know you know
in the past it's kind of like you know

5840
01:53:50,420 --> 01:53:50,430
in the past it's kind of like you know
 

5841
01:53:50,430 --> 01:53:51,740
in the past it's kind of like you know
moons of Jupiter or something but

5842
01:53:51,740 --> 01:53:51,750
moons of Jupiter or something but
 

5843
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:52,850
moons of Jupiter or something but
suddenly you see something that's kind

5844
01:53:52,850 --> 01:53:52,860
suddenly you see something that's kind
 

5845
01:53:52,860 --> 01:53:55,400
suddenly you see something that's kind
of very unexpected and rule 30 was very

5846
01:53:55,400 --> 01:53:55,410
of very unexpected and rule 30 was very
 

5847
01:53:55,410 --> 01:53:57,440
of very unexpected and rule 30 was very
unexpected for me and the big challenge

5848
01:53:57,440 --> 01:53:57,450
unexpected for me and the big challenge
 

5849
01:53:57,450 --> 01:54:00,410
unexpected for me and the big challenge
at a personal level was to not ignore it

5850
01:54:00,410 --> 01:54:00,420
at a personal level was to not ignore it
 

5851
01:54:00,420 --> 01:54:02,900
at a personal level was to not ignore it
I mean people you know in other words

5852
01:54:02,900 --> 01:54:02,910
I mean people you know in other words
 

5853
01:54:02,910 --> 01:54:06,440
I mean people you know in other words
you might say you know it's a bug what

5854
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:06,450
you might say you know it's a bug what
 

5855
01:54:06,450 --> 01:54:07,910
you might say you know it's a bug what
would you say yeah well yeah I mean I I

5856
01:54:07,910 --> 01:54:07,920
would you say yeah well yeah I mean I I
 

5857
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:09,860
would you say yeah well yeah I mean I I
what are we looking at by the way well I

5858
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:09,870
what are we looking at by the way well I
 

5859
01:54:09,870 --> 01:54:11,420
what are we looking at by the way well I
was just generating Herald actually

5860
01:54:11,420 --> 01:54:11,430
was just generating Herald actually
 

5861
01:54:11,430 --> 01:54:13,490
was just generating Herald actually
generated a rule 30 pattern so that's

5862
01:54:13,490 --> 01:54:13,500
generated a rule 30 pattern so that's
 

5863
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:17,630
generated a rule 30 pattern so that's
the rule for for rule 30 and it says for

5864
01:54:17,630 --> 01:54:17,640
the rule for for rule 30 and it says for
 

5865
01:54:17,640 --> 01:54:19,610
the rule for for rule 30 and it says for
example it says here if you have a black

5866
01:54:19,610 --> 01:54:19,620
example it says here if you have a black
 

5867
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:21,440
example it says here if you have a black
cell in the middle and black cell to the

5868
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:21,450
cell in the middle and black cell to the
 

5869
01:54:21,450 --> 01:54:22,970
cell in the middle and black cell to the
left and white cell to the right then

5870
01:54:22,970 --> 01:54:22,980
left and white cell to the right then
 

5871
01:54:22,980 --> 01:54:24,590
left and white cell to the right then
the cell on the next step will be white

5872
01:54:24,590 --> 01:54:24,600
the cell on the next step will be white
 

5873
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:27,440
the cell on the next step will be white
and so here's the actual pattern that

5874
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:27,450
and so here's the actual pattern that
 

5875
01:54:27,450 --> 01:54:29,360
and so here's the actual pattern that
you get starting off from a single black

5876
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:29,370
you get starting off from a single black
 

5877
01:54:29,370 --> 01:54:33,080
you get starting off from a single black
cell at the top there and then that's

5878
01:54:33,080 --> 01:54:33,090
cell at the top there and then that's
 

5879
01:54:33,090 --> 01:54:34,700
cell at the top there and then that's
the initial state initial condition

5880
01:54:34,700 --> 01:54:34,710
the initial state initial condition
 

5881
01:54:34,710 --> 01:54:36,080
the initial state initial condition
that's the initial thing you just start

5882
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:36,090
that's the initial thing you just start
 

5883
01:54:36,090 --> 01:54:37,850
that's the initial thing you just start
off from that and then you're going down

5884
01:54:37,850 --> 01:54:37,860
off from that and then you're going down
 

5885
01:54:37,860 --> 01:54:40,490
off from that and then you're going down
the page and at every at every step

5886
01:54:40,490 --> 01:54:40,500
the page and at every at every step
 

5887
01:54:40,500 --> 01:54:43,460
the page and at every at every step
you're just applying this rule to find

5888
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:43,470
you're just applying this rule to find
 

5889
01:54:43,470 --> 01:54:45,310
you're just applying this rule to find
out the new value that you get and so

5890
01:54:45,310 --> 01:54:45,320
out the new value that you get and so
 

5891
01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:48,560
out the new value that you get and so
you might think rule that simple you got

5892
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:48,570
you might think rule that simple you got
 

5893
01:54:48,570 --> 01:54:50,330
you might think rule that simple you got
to get that there's got to be some trace

5894
01:54:50,330 --> 01:54:50,340
to get that there's got to be some trace
 

5895
01:54:50,340 --> 01:54:52,670
to get that there's got to be some trace
of that simplicity here okay we'll run

5896
01:54:52,670 --> 01:54:52,680
of that simplicity here okay we'll run
 

5897
01:54:52,680 --> 01:54:55,640
of that simplicity here okay we'll run
it let's say for 400 steps um what it

5898
01:54:55,640 --> 01:54:55,650
it let's say for 400 steps um what it
 

5899
01:54:55,650 --> 01:54:57,590
it let's say for 400 steps um what it
does it's kind of really asking a bit on

5900
01:54:57,590 --> 01:54:57,600
does it's kind of really asking a bit on
 

5901
01:54:57,600 --> 01:54:59,570
does it's kind of really asking a bit on
the screen there but but um you can see

5902
01:54:59,570 --> 01:54:59,580
the screen there but but um you can see
 

5903
01:54:59,580 --> 01:55:01,190
the screen there but but um you can see
there's a little bit of regularity over

5904
01:55:01,190 --> 01:55:01,200
there's a little bit of regularity over
 

5905
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:05,240
there's a little bit of regularity over
on the left but there's a lot of stuff

5906
01:55:05,240 --> 01:55:05,250
on the left but there's a lot of stuff
 

5907
01:55:05,250 --> 01:55:06,770
on the left but there's a lot of stuff
here that just looks very complicated

5908
01:55:06,770 --> 01:55:06,780
here that just looks very complicated
 

5909
01:55:06,780 --> 01:55:11,150
here that just looks very complicated
very random and that's a big sort of

5910
01:55:11,150 --> 01:55:11,160
very random and that's a big sort of
 

5911
01:55:11,160 --> 01:55:13,550
very random and that's a big sort of
shock to was a big shock to my intuition

5912
01:55:13,550 --> 01:55:13,560
shock to was a big shock to my intuition
 

5913
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:16,010
shock to was a big shock to my intuition
at least that that's possible your mind

5914
01:55:16,010 --> 01:55:16,020
at least that that's possible your mind
 

5915
01:55:16,020 --> 01:55:18,020
at least that that's possible your mind
immediately starts is there a pattern

5916
01:55:18,020 --> 01:55:18,030
immediately starts is there a pattern
 

5917
01:55:18,030 --> 01:55:20,030
immediately starts is there a pattern
there must be a repetitive pattern yeah

5918
01:55:20,030 --> 01:55:20,040
there must be a repetitive pattern yeah
 

5919
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:21,350
there must be a repetitive pattern yeah
there must be as well the rhein so I

5920
01:55:21,350 --> 01:55:21,360
there must be as well the rhein so I
 

5921
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:23,930
there must be as well the rhein so I
spent so indeed that's what I thought at

5922
01:55:23,930 --> 01:55:23,940
spent so indeed that's what I thought at
 

5923
01:55:23,940 --> 01:55:26,000
spent so indeed that's what I thought at
first and I thought I thought well this

5924
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:26,010
first and I thought I thought well this
 

5925
01:55:26,010 --> 01:55:27,710
first and I thought I thought well this
is kind of interesting but you know if

5926
01:55:27,710 --> 01:55:27,720
is kind of interesting but you know if
 

5927
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:27,939
is kind of interesting but you know if
we

5928
01:55:27,939 --> 01:55:27,949
we
 

5929
01:55:27,949 --> 01:55:30,370
we
long enough we'll see you know something

5930
01:55:30,370 --> 01:55:30,380
long enough we'll see you know something
 

5931
01:55:30,380 --> 01:55:32,850
long enough we'll see you know something
will resolve into something simple and

5932
01:55:32,850 --> 01:55:32,860
will resolve into something simple and
 

5933
01:55:32,860 --> 01:55:35,620
will resolve into something simple and
you know I did all kinds of analysis of

5934
01:55:35,620 --> 01:55:35,630
you know I did all kinds of analysis of
 

5935
01:55:35,630 --> 01:55:37,680
you know I did all kinds of analysis of
using mathematics statistics

5936
01:55:37,680 --> 01:55:37,690
using mathematics statistics
 

5937
01:55:37,690 --> 01:55:40,750
using mathematics statistics
cryptography whatever whatever to try

5938
01:55:40,750 --> 01:55:40,760
cryptography whatever whatever to try
 

5939
01:55:40,760 --> 01:55:43,689
cryptography whatever whatever to try
and crack it and I never succeeded and

5940
01:55:43,689 --> 01:55:43,699
and crack it and I never succeeded and
 

5941
01:55:43,699 --> 01:55:45,219
and crack it and I never succeeded and
after I hadn't succeeded for awhile I

5942
01:55:45,219 --> 01:55:45,229
after I hadn't succeeded for awhile I
 

5943
01:55:45,229 --> 01:55:47,160
after I hadn't succeeded for awhile I
started thinking maybe there's a real

5944
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:47,170
started thinking maybe there's a real
 

5945
01:55:47,170 --> 01:55:49,870
started thinking maybe there's a real
phenomenon here that is the reason I'm

5946
01:55:49,870 --> 01:55:49,880
phenomenon here that is the reason I'm
 

5947
01:55:49,880 --> 01:55:51,969
phenomenon here that is the reason I'm
not succeeding maybe I mean the thing

5948
01:55:51,969 --> 01:55:51,979
not succeeding maybe I mean the thing
 

5949
01:55:51,979 --> 01:55:53,589
not succeeding maybe I mean the thing
that for me was sort of a motivating

5950
01:55:53,589 --> 01:55:53,599
that for me was sort of a motivating
 

5951
01:55:53,599 --> 01:55:56,109
that for me was sort of a motivating
factor was looking at the natural world

5952
01:55:56,109 --> 01:55:56,119
factor was looking at the natural world
 

5953
01:55:56,119 --> 01:55:57,580
factor was looking at the natural world
and seeing all this complexity that

5954
01:55:57,580 --> 01:55:57,590
and seeing all this complexity that
 

5955
01:55:57,590 --> 01:55:59,350
and seeing all this complexity that
exists in the natural world the question

5956
01:55:59,350 --> 01:55:59,360
exists in the natural world the question
 

5957
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:00,399
exists in the natural world the question
is where does it come from

5958
01:56:00,399 --> 01:56:00,409
is where does it come from
 

5959
01:56:00,409 --> 01:56:02,500
is where does it come from
you know what secret does nature have

5960
01:56:02,500 --> 01:56:02,510
you know what secret does nature have
 

5961
01:56:02,510 --> 01:56:04,479
you know what secret does nature have
that lets it make all this complexity

5962
01:56:04,479 --> 01:56:04,489
that lets it make all this complexity
 

5963
01:56:04,489 --> 01:56:06,939
that lets it make all this complexity
that we humans when we engineer things

5964
01:56:06,939 --> 01:56:06,949
that we humans when we engineer things
 

5965
01:56:06,949 --> 01:56:09,520
that we humans when we engineer things
typically are not making we're typically

5966
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:09,530
typically are not making we're typically
 

5967
01:56:09,530 --> 01:56:11,319
typically are not making we're typically
making things that at least look quite

5968
01:56:11,319 --> 01:56:11,329
making things that at least look quite
 

5969
01:56:11,329 --> 01:56:14,949
making things that at least look quite
simple to us and so the shock here was

5970
01:56:14,949 --> 01:56:14,959
simple to us and so the shock here was
 

5971
01:56:14,959 --> 01:56:16,810
simple to us and so the shock here was
even from something very simple you're

5972
01:56:16,810 --> 01:56:16,820
even from something very simple you're
 

5973
01:56:16,820 --> 01:56:19,959
even from something very simple you're
making something that complex maybe this

5974
01:56:19,959 --> 01:56:19,969
making something that complex maybe this
 

5975
01:56:19,969 --> 01:56:21,759
making something that complex maybe this
is getting at sort of the secret that

5976
01:56:21,759 --> 01:56:21,769
is getting at sort of the secret that
 

5977
01:56:21,769 --> 01:56:24,370
is getting at sort of the secret that
nature has that allows it to make really

5978
01:56:24,370 --> 01:56:24,380
nature has that allows it to make really
 

5979
01:56:24,380 --> 01:56:27,129
nature has that allows it to make really
complex things even though its

5980
01:56:27,129 --> 01:56:27,139
complex things even though its
 

5981
01:56:27,139 --> 01:56:29,020
complex things even though its
underlying rules may not be that complex

5982
01:56:29,020 --> 01:56:29,030
underlying rules may not be that complex
 

5983
01:56:29,030 --> 01:56:31,089
underlying rules may not be that complex
how did it make you feel if we if we

5984
01:56:31,089 --> 01:56:31,099
how did it make you feel if we if we
 

5985
01:56:31,099 --> 01:56:34,390
how did it make you feel if we if we
look at the Newton Apple was there was

5986
01:56:34,390 --> 01:56:34,400
look at the Newton Apple was there was
 

5987
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:36,189
look at the Newton Apple was there was
it was there you know you took a walk

5988
01:56:36,189 --> 01:56:36,199
it was there you know you took a walk
 

5989
01:56:36,199 --> 01:56:40,120
it was there you know you took a walk
and in something it profoundly hit you

5990
01:56:40,120 --> 01:56:40,130
and in something it profoundly hit you
 

5991
01:56:40,130 --> 01:56:42,629
and in something it profoundly hit you
or was this a gradual thing a lot of

5992
01:56:42,629 --> 01:56:42,639
or was this a gradual thing a lot of
 

5993
01:56:42,639 --> 01:56:46,449
or was this a gradual thing a lot of
truth the truth of every sort of science

5994
01:56:46,449 --> 01:56:46,459
truth the truth of every sort of science
 

5995
01:56:46,459 --> 01:56:49,089
truth the truth of every sort of science
discovery is it's not that gradual I

5996
01:56:49,089 --> 01:56:49,099
discovery is it's not that gradual I
 

5997
01:56:49,099 --> 01:56:51,129
discovery is it's not that gradual I
mean I've spent I happen to be

5998
01:56:51,129 --> 01:56:51,139
mean I've spent I happen to be
 

5999
01:56:51,139 --> 01:56:52,779
mean I've spent I happen to be
interested in scientific biography kinds

6000
01:56:52,779 --> 01:56:52,789
interested in scientific biography kinds
 

6001
01:56:52,789 --> 01:56:53,979
interested in scientific biography kinds
of things and so I've tried to track

6002
01:56:53,979 --> 01:56:53,989
of things and so I've tried to track
 

6003
01:56:53,989 --> 01:56:55,689
of things and so I've tried to track
down you know how did people come to

6004
01:56:55,689 --> 01:56:55,699
down you know how did people come to
 

6005
01:56:55,699 --> 01:56:57,390
down you know how did people come to
figure out this or that thing and

6006
01:56:57,390 --> 01:56:57,400
figure out this or that thing and
 

6007
01:56:57,400 --> 01:57:01,029
figure out this or that thing and
there's always a long kind of sort of

6008
01:57:01,029 --> 01:57:01,039
there's always a long kind of sort of
 

6009
01:57:01,039 --> 01:57:04,600
there's always a long kind of sort of
preparatory you know there's a there's a

6010
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:04,610
preparatory you know there's a there's a
 

6011
01:57:04,610 --> 01:57:07,060
preparatory you know there's a there's a
need to be prepared in a mindset in

6012
01:57:07,060 --> 01:57:07,070
need to be prepared in a mindset in
 

6013
01:57:07,070 --> 01:57:08,709
need to be prepared in a mindset in
which it's possible to see something I

6014
01:57:08,709 --> 01:57:08,719
which it's possible to see something I
 

6015
01:57:08,719 --> 01:57:10,870
which it's possible to see something I
mean in the case of rule 30 our eyes

6016
01:57:10,870 --> 01:57:10,880
mean in the case of rule 30 our eyes
 

6017
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:14,830
mean in the case of rule 30 our eyes
around June 1st 1984 was some kind of a

6018
01:57:14,830 --> 01:57:14,840
around June 1st 1984 was some kind of a
 

6019
01:57:14,840 --> 01:57:16,660
around June 1st 1984 was some kind of a
silly story in some ways I finally had a

6020
01:57:16,660 --> 01:57:16,670
silly story in some ways I finally had a
 

6021
01:57:16,670 --> 01:57:19,120
silly story in some ways I finally had a
high-resolution laser printer so I was

6022
01:57:19,120 --> 01:57:19,130
high-resolution laser printer so I was
 

6023
01:57:19,130 --> 01:57:20,560
high-resolution laser printer so I was
able so I thought I'm gonna generate a

6024
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:20,570
able so I thought I'm gonna generate a
 

6025
01:57:20,570 --> 01:57:22,000
able so I thought I'm gonna generate a
bunch of pictures of these cellular

6026
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:22,010
bunch of pictures of these cellular
 

6027
01:57:22,010 --> 01:57:24,609
bunch of pictures of these cellular
automata and I generate this one and I

6028
01:57:24,609 --> 01:57:24,619
automata and I generate this one and I
 

6029
01:57:24,619 --> 01:57:27,399
automata and I generate this one and I
put it on some plane flight for to

6030
01:57:27,399 --> 01:57:27,409
put it on some plane flight for to
 

6031
01:57:27,409 --> 01:57:29,469
put it on some plane flight for to
Europe you know have this with me and

6032
01:57:29,469 --> 01:57:29,479
Europe you know have this with me and
 

6033
01:57:29,479 --> 01:57:32,020
Europe you know have this with me and
it's like you know I really should try

6034
01:57:32,020 --> 01:57:32,030
it's like you know I really should try
 

6035
01:57:32,030 --> 01:57:34,149
it's like you know I really should try
to understand this and this is really

6036
01:57:34,149 --> 01:57:34,159
to understand this and this is really
 

6037
01:57:34,159 --> 01:57:35,949
to understand this and this is really
you know this is I really don't

6038
01:57:35,949 --> 01:57:35,959
you know this is I really don't
 

6039
01:57:35,959 --> 01:57:38,439
you know this is I really don't
understand what's going on and that was

6040
01:57:38,439 --> 01:57:38,449
understand what's going on and that was
 

6041
01:57:38,449 --> 01:57:41,890
understand what's going on and that was
kind of the you know slowly trying to

6042
01:57:41,890 --> 01:57:41,900
kind of the you know slowly trying to
 

6043
01:57:41,900 --> 01:57:43,990
kind of the you know slowly trying to
trying to see what was happening as it

6044
01:57:43,990 --> 01:57:44,000
trying to see what was happening as it
 

6045
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:47,500
trying to see what was happening as it
was not it was depressingly uncertain so

6046
01:57:47,500 --> 01:57:47,510
was not it was depressingly uncertain so
 

6047
01:57:47,510 --> 01:57:50,080
was not it was depressingly uncertain so
to speak in the sense that a lot of

6048
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:50,090
to speak in the sense that a lot of
 

6049
01:57:50,090 --> 01:57:52,540
to speak in the sense that a lot of
these ideas like principle of

6050
01:57:52,540 --> 01:57:52,550
these ideas like principle of
 

6051
01:57:52,550 --> 01:57:54,010
these ideas like principle of
computational equivalence for example

6052
01:57:54,010 --> 01:57:54,020
computational equivalence for example
 

6053
01:57:54,020 --> 01:57:56,260
computational equivalence for example
you know I thought well that's a

6054
01:57:56,260 --> 01:57:56,270
you know I thought well that's a
 

6055
01:57:56,270 --> 01:57:57,910
you know I thought well that's a
possible thing I didn't know if it's

6056
01:57:57,910 --> 01:57:57,920
possible thing I didn't know if it's
 

6057
01:57:57,920 --> 01:57:59,770
possible thing I didn't know if it's
correct still don't know for sure that

6058
01:57:59,770 --> 01:57:59,780
correct still don't know for sure that
 

6059
01:57:59,780 --> 01:58:02,500
correct still don't know for sure that
it's correct but it's sort of a gradual

6060
01:58:02,500 --> 01:58:02,510
it's correct but it's sort of a gradual
 

6061
01:58:02,510 --> 01:58:04,689
it's correct but it's sort of a gradual
thing that these things gradually kind

6062
01:58:04,689 --> 01:58:04,699
thing that these things gradually kind
 

6063
01:58:04,699 --> 01:58:07,780
thing that these things gradually kind
of become seem more important than one

6064
01:58:07,780 --> 01:58:07,790
of become seem more important than one
 

6065
01:58:07,790 --> 01:58:09,970
of become seem more important than one
thought I mean I think the whole idea of

6066
01:58:09,970 --> 01:58:09,980
thought I mean I think the whole idea of
 

6067
01:58:09,980 --> 01:58:11,950
thought I mean I think the whole idea of
studying the computational universe of

6068
01:58:11,950 --> 01:58:11,960
studying the computational universe of
 

6069
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:15,669
studying the computational universe of
simple programs it took me probably a

6070
01:58:15,669 --> 01:58:15,679
simple programs it took me probably a
 

6071
01:58:15,679 --> 01:58:17,709
simple programs it took me probably a
decade decade and a half to kind of

6072
01:58:17,709 --> 01:58:17,719
decade decade and a half to kind of
 

6073
01:58:17,719 --> 01:58:19,600
decade decade and a half to kind of
internalize that that was really an

6074
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:19,610
internalize that that was really an
 

6075
01:58:19,610 --> 01:58:22,570
internalize that that was really an
important idea um and I think you know

6076
01:58:22,570 --> 01:58:22,580
important idea um and I think you know
 

6077
01:58:22,580 --> 01:58:24,340
important idea um and I think you know
if it turns out we find the whole

6078
01:58:24,340 --> 01:58:24,350
if it turns out we find the whole
 

6079
01:58:24,350 --> 01:58:25,899
if it turns out we find the whole
universe looking out there in the

6080
01:58:25,899 --> 01:58:25,909
universe looking out there in the
 

6081
01:58:25,909 --> 01:58:28,689
universe looking out there in the
computational universe that's a good you

6082
01:58:28,689 --> 01:58:28,699
computational universe that's a good you
 

6083
01:58:28,699 --> 01:58:29,919
computational universe that's a good you
know it's a good brownie point or

6084
01:58:29,919 --> 01:58:29,929
know it's a good brownie point or
 

6085
01:58:29,929 --> 01:58:32,439
know it's a good brownie point or
something for the for the whole idea but

6086
01:58:32,439 --> 01:58:32,449
something for the for the whole idea but
 

6087
01:58:32,449 --> 01:58:34,930
something for the for the whole idea but
I think that the the thing that strange

6088
01:58:34,930 --> 01:58:34,940
I think that the the thing that strange
 

6089
01:58:34,940 --> 01:58:37,330
I think that the the thing that strange
in this whole question about you know

6090
01:58:37,330 --> 01:58:37,340
in this whole question about you know
 

6091
01:58:37,340 --> 01:58:39,580
in this whole question about you know
finding this different raw material for

6092
01:58:39,580 --> 01:58:39,590
finding this different raw material for
 

6093
01:58:39,590 --> 01:58:42,310
finding this different raw material for
making models of things um what's been

6094
01:58:42,310 --> 01:58:42,320
making models of things um what's been
 

6095
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:43,840
making models of things um what's been
interesting sort of in the in sort of

6096
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:43,850
interesting sort of in the in sort of
 

6097
01:58:43,850 --> 01:58:46,360
interesting sort of in the in sort of
arc of history is you know for 300 years

6098
01:58:46,360 --> 01:58:46,370
arc of history is you know for 300 years
 

6099
01:58:46,370 --> 01:58:48,130
arc of history is you know for 300 years
it's kind of like the the mathematical

6100
01:58:48,130 --> 01:58:48,140
it's kind of like the the mathematical
 

6101
01:58:48,140 --> 01:58:50,590
it's kind of like the the mathematical
equations approach it was the winner it

6102
01:58:50,590 --> 01:58:50,600
equations approach it was the winner it
 

6103
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:52,060
equations approach it was the winner it
was the thing you know you want to have

6104
01:58:52,060 --> 01:58:52,070
was the thing you know you want to have
 

6105
01:58:52,070 --> 01:58:53,530
was the thing you know you want to have
a really a good model for something

6106
01:58:53,530 --> 01:58:53,540
a really a good model for something
 

6107
01:58:53,540 --> 01:58:55,899
a really a good model for something
that's what you use the thing that's

6108
01:58:55,899 --> 01:58:55,909
that's what you use the thing that's
 

6109
01:58:55,909 --> 01:58:57,550
that's what you use the thing that's
been remarkable is just in the last

6110
01:58:57,550 --> 01:58:57,560
been remarkable is just in the last
 

6111
01:58:57,560 --> 01:58:59,950
been remarkable is just in the last
decade or so I think one can see a

6112
01:58:59,950 --> 01:58:59,960
decade or so I think one can see a
 

6113
01:58:59,960 --> 01:59:03,070
decade or so I think one can see a
transition to using not mathematical

6114
01:59:03,070 --> 01:59:03,080
transition to using not mathematical
 

6115
01:59:03,080 --> 01:59:05,530
transition to using not mathematical
equations but programs as sort of the

6116
01:59:05,530 --> 01:59:05,540
equations but programs as sort of the
 

6117
01:59:05,540 --> 01:59:07,450
equations but programs as sort of the
raw material for making models of stuff

6118
01:59:07,450 --> 01:59:07,460
raw material for making models of stuff
 

6119
01:59:07,460 --> 01:59:10,600
raw material for making models of stuff
and that's pretty neat and it's kind of

6120
01:59:10,600 --> 01:59:10,610
and that's pretty neat and it's kind of
 

6121
01:59:10,610 --> 01:59:13,030
and that's pretty neat and it's kind of
you know as somebody who's kind of lived

6122
01:59:13,030 --> 01:59:13,040
you know as somebody who's kind of lived
 

6123
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:14,979
you know as somebody who's kind of lived
inside this paradigm shift so to speak

6124
01:59:14,979 --> 01:59:14,989
inside this paradigm shift so to speak
 

6125
01:59:14,989 --> 01:59:19,000
inside this paradigm shift so to speak
it is bizarre I mean no doubt instead of

6126
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:19,010
it is bizarre I mean no doubt instead of
 

6127
01:59:19,010 --> 01:59:20,410
it is bizarre I mean no doubt instead of
the history of science that will be seen

6128
01:59:20,410 --> 01:59:20,420
the history of science that will be seen
 

6129
01:59:20,420 --> 01:59:23,020
the history of science that will be seen
as an instantaneous paradigm shift but

6130
01:59:23,020 --> 01:59:23,030
as an instantaneous paradigm shift but
 

6131
01:59:23,030 --> 01:59:24,669
as an instantaneous paradigm shift but
it sure isn't instantaneous when it's

6132
01:59:24,669 --> 01:59:24,679
it sure isn't instantaneous when it's
 

6133
01:59:24,679 --> 01:59:26,350
it sure isn't instantaneous when it's
played out in one's actual life so to

6134
01:59:26,350 --> 01:59:26,360
played out in one's actual life so to
 

6135
01:59:26,360 --> 01:59:27,010
played out in one's actual life so to
speak try

6136
01:59:27,010 --> 01:59:27,020
speak try
 

6137
01:59:27,020 --> 01:59:30,700
speak try
it seems glacial and and it's the kind

6138
01:59:30,700 --> 01:59:30,710
it seems glacial and and it's the kind
 

6139
01:59:30,710 --> 01:59:32,830
it seems glacial and and it's the kind
of thing where where it's sort of

6140
01:59:32,830 --> 01:59:32,840
of thing where where it's sort of
 

6141
01:59:32,840 --> 01:59:35,530
of thing where where it's sort of
interesting because in the dynamics of

6142
01:59:35,530 --> 01:59:35,540
interesting because in the dynamics of
 

6143
01:59:35,540 --> 01:59:38,100
interesting because in the dynamics of
sort of the adoption of ideas like that

6144
01:59:38,100 --> 01:59:38,110
sort of the adoption of ideas like that
 

6145
01:59:38,110 --> 01:59:41,020
sort of the adoption of ideas like that
into different fields the younger the

6146
01:59:41,020 --> 01:59:41,030
into different fields the younger the
 

6147
01:59:41,030 --> 01:59:43,209
into different fields the younger the
field the faster the adoption typically

6148
01:59:43,209 --> 01:59:43,219
field the faster the adoption typically
 

6149
01:59:43,219 --> 01:59:46,180
field the faster the adoption typically
because people are not kind of locked in

6150
01:59:46,180 --> 01:59:46,190
because people are not kind of locked in
 

6151
01:59:46,190 --> 01:59:48,160
because people are not kind of locked in
with the fifth generation of people

01:59:55,290 --> 01:59:57,470

6162
01:59:59,480 --> 01:59:59,490
interesting I mean I'm I'm I think I'm
 

6163
01:59:59,490 --> 02:00:03,710

fortunate that I I've I I do stuff

fortunate that I I've I I do stuff
 

6165
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:07,130
fortunate that I I've I I do stuff
mainly because I like doing it and if I

6166
02:00:07,130 --> 02:00:07,140
mainly because I like doing it and if I
 

6167
02:00:07,140 --> 02:00:09,170
mainly because I like doing it and if I
was some that makes me kind of

6168
02:00:09,170 --> 02:00:09,180
was some that makes me kind of
 

6169
02:00:09,180 --> 02:00:11,030
was some that makes me kind of
thick-skinned about the world's response

6170
02:00:11,030 --> 02:00:11,040
thick-skinned about the world's response
 

6171
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:13,520
thick-skinned about the world's response
to what I do um and but that's

6172
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:13,530
to what I do um and but that's
 

6173
02:00:13,530 --> 02:00:16,910
to what I do um and but that's
definitely you know and anytime you you

6174
02:00:16,910 --> 02:00:16,920
definitely you know and anytime you you
 

6175
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:18,410
definitely you know and anytime you you
write a book called something like a new

6176
02:00:18,410 --> 02:00:18,420
write a book called something like a new
 

6177
02:00:18,420 --> 02:00:21,470
write a book called something like a new
kind of science it's kind of the the

6178
02:00:21,470 --> 02:00:21,480
kind of science it's kind of the the
 

6179
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:24,020
kind of science it's kind of the the
pitchforks will come out for the for the

6180
02:00:24,020 --> 02:00:24,030
pitchforks will come out for the for the
 

6181
02:00:24,030 --> 02:00:25,670
pitchforks will come out for the for the
old kind of science and I was was

6182
02:00:25,670 --> 02:00:25,680
old kind of science and I was was
 

6183
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:29,330
old kind of science and I was was
interesting dynamics I think that the I

6184
02:00:29,330 --> 02:00:29,340
interesting dynamics I think that the I
 

6185
02:00:29,340 --> 02:00:32,300
interesting dynamics I think that the I
I have to say that I was fully aware of

6186
02:00:32,300 --> 02:00:32,310
I have to say that I was fully aware of
 

6187
02:00:32,310 --> 02:00:35,630
I have to say that I was fully aware of
the fact that the when you see sort of

6188
02:00:35,630 --> 02:00:35,640
the fact that the when you see sort of
 

6189
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:38,510
the fact that the when you see sort of
incipient paradigm shifts in science the

6190
02:00:38,510 --> 02:00:38,520
incipient paradigm shifts in science the
 

6191
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:41,570
incipient paradigm shifts in science the
vigor of the negative response upon

6192
02:00:41,570 --> 02:00:41,580
vigor of the negative response upon
 

6193
02:00:41,580 --> 02:00:44,120
vigor of the negative response upon
early introduction is a fantastic

6194
02:00:44,120 --> 02:00:44,130
early introduction is a fantastic
 

6195
02:00:44,130 --> 02:00:46,720
early introduction is a fantastic
positive indicator of good long-term

6196
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:46,730
positive indicator of good long-term
 

6197
02:00:46,730 --> 02:00:50,390
positive indicator of good long-term
results so in other words if people just

6198
02:00:50,390 --> 02:00:50,400
results so in other words if people just
 

6199
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:53,810
results so in other words if people just
don't care it's um you know that's not

6200
02:00:53,810 --> 02:00:53,820
don't care it's um you know that's not
 

6201
02:00:53,820 --> 02:00:56,030
don't care it's um you know that's not
such a good sign if they're like oh this

6202
02:00:56,030 --> 02:00:56,040
such a good sign if they're like oh this
 

6203
02:00:56,040 --> 02:00:57,560
such a good sign if they're like oh this
is great that means you didn't really

6204
02:00:57,560 --> 02:00:57,570
is great that means you didn't really
 

6205
02:00:57,570 --> 02:01:00,950
is great that means you didn't really
discover anything interesting um what

6206
02:01:00,950 --> 02:01:00,960
discover anything interesting um what
 

6207
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:03,410
discover anything interesting um what
fascinating properties of rule 30 have

6208
02:01:03,410 --> 02:01:03,420
fascinating properties of rule 30 have
 

6209
02:01:03,420 --> 02:01:05,300
fascinating properties of rule 30 have
you discovered over the years you've

6210
02:01:05,300 --> 02:01:05,310
you discovered over the years you've
 

6211
02:01:05,310 --> 02:01:07,340
you discovered over the years you've
recently announced the rule 30 prizes

6212
02:01:07,340 --> 02:01:07,350
recently announced the rule 30 prizes
 

6213
02:01:07,350 --> 02:01:09,860
recently announced the rule 30 prizes
for solving three key problems can you

6214
02:01:09,860 --> 02:01:09,870
for solving three key problems can you
 

6215
02:01:09,870 --> 02:01:12,260
for solving three key problems can you
maybe talk about interesting properties

6216
02:01:12,260 --> 02:01:12,270
maybe talk about interesting properties
 

6217
02:01:12,270 --> 02:01:15,860
maybe talk about interesting properties
that have been kind of revealed rule 30

6218
02:01:15,860 --> 02:01:15,870
that have been kind of revealed rule 30
 

6219
02:01:15,870 --> 02:01:17,990
that have been kind of revealed rule 30
or other cellular automata and what

6220
02:01:17,990 --> 02:01:18,000
or other cellular automata and what
 

6221
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,090
or other cellular automata and what
problems are still before us like the

6222
02:01:20,090 --> 02:01:20,100
problems are still before us like the
 

6223
02:01:20,100 --> 02:01:21,560
problems are still before us like the
three problems you've announced yeah

6224
02:01:21,560 --> 02:01:21,570
three problems you've announced yeah
 

6225
02:01:21,570 --> 02:01:24,980
three problems you've announced yeah
yeah right so I mean the most

6226
02:01:24,980 --> 02:01:24,990
yeah right so I mean the most
 

6227
02:01:24,990 --> 02:01:26,330
yeah right so I mean the most
interesting thing about cellular

6228
02:01:26,330 --> 02:01:26,340
interesting thing about cellular
 

6229
02:01:26,340 --> 02:01:28,010
interesting thing about cellular
automata is that it's hard to figure

6230
02:01:28,010 --> 02:01:28,020
automata is that it's hard to figure
 

6231
02:01:28,020 --> 02:01:31,970
automata is that it's hard to figure
stuff out about them and that's some in

6232
02:01:31,970 --> 02:01:31,980
stuff out about them and that's some in
 

6233
02:01:31,980 --> 02:01:34,540
stuff out about them and that's some in
a sense every time you try and sort of

6234
02:01:34,540 --> 02:01:34,550
a sense every time you try and sort of
 

6235
02:01:34,550 --> 02:01:36,920
a sense every time you try and sort of
you try and bash them with some other

6236
02:01:36,920 --> 02:01:36,930
you try and bash them with some other
 

6237
02:01:36,930 --> 02:01:40,130
you try and bash them with some other
technique you say can i crack them the

6238
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:40,140
technique you say can i crack them the
 

6239
02:01:40,140 --> 02:01:41,540
technique you say can i crack them the
answer is they seem to be uncrackable

6240
02:01:41,540 --> 02:01:41,550
answer is they seem to be uncrackable
 

6241
02:01:41,550 --> 02:01:44,840
answer is they seem to be uncrackable
they seem to have the feature that they

6242
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:44,850
they seem to have the feature that they
 

6243
02:01:44,850 --> 02:01:47,150
they seem to have the feature that they
are that they're sort of showing

6244
02:01:47,150 --> 02:01:47,160
are that they're sort of showing
 

6245
02:01:47,160 --> 02:01:49,610
are that they're sort of showing
irreducible computation they're not

6246
02:01:49,610 --> 02:01:49,620
irreducible computation they're not
 

6247
02:01:49,620 --> 02:01:52,280
irreducible computation they're not
you're not able to say oh I know exactly

6248
02:01:52,280 --> 02:01:52,290
you're not able to say oh I know exactly
 

6249
02:01:52,290 --> 02:01:54,020
you're not able to say oh I know exactly
what this is going to do it's going to

6250
02:01:54,020 --> 02:01:54,030
what this is going to do it's going to
 

6251
02:01:54,030 --> 02:01:56,170
what this is going to do it's going to
do this or that but there's a specific

6252
02:01:56,170 --> 02:01:56,180
do this or that but there's a specific
 

6253
02:01:56,180 --> 02:01:59,390
do this or that but there's a specific
formulations of that fact yes right so I

6254
02:01:59,390 --> 02:01:59,400
formulations of that fact yes right so I
 

6255
02:01:59,400 --> 02:02:01,970
formulations of that fact yes right so I
mean for example in in rule 30 in the

6256
02:02:01,970 --> 02:02:01,980
mean for example in in rule 30 in the
 

6257
02:02:01,980 --> 02:02:03,500
mean for example in in rule 30 in the
pattern you get just starting from a

6258
02:02:03,500 --> 02:02:03,510
pattern you get just starting from a
 

6259
02:02:03,510 --> 02:02:05,870
pattern you get just starting from a
single black cell you get this sort of

6260
02:02:05,870 --> 02:02:05,880
single black cell you get this sort of
 

6261
02:02:05,880 --> 02:02:08,969
single black cell you get this sort of
very very sort of random

6262
02:02:08,969 --> 02:02:08,979
very very sort of random
 

6263
02:02:08,979 --> 02:02:11,310
very very sort of random
pattern and so one feature of that just

6264
02:02:11,310 --> 02:02:11,320
pattern and so one feature of that just
 

6265
02:02:11,320 --> 02:02:13,229
pattern and so one feature of that just
look at the center column and for

6266
02:02:13,229 --> 02:02:13,239
look at the center column and for
 

6267
02:02:13,239 --> 02:02:15,600
look at the center column and for
example we used that for a long time to

6268
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:15,610
example we used that for a long time to
 

6269
02:02:15,610 --> 02:02:17,100
example we used that for a long time to
generate random the symbol from language

6270
02:02:17,100 --> 02:02:17,110
generate random the symbol from language
 

6271
02:02:17,110 --> 02:02:20,100
generate random the symbol from language
um just you know what rule 30 produces

6272
02:02:20,100 --> 02:02:20,110
um just you know what rule 30 produces
 

6273
02:02:20,110 --> 02:02:22,830
um just you know what rule 30 produces
now the question is can you prove how

6274
02:02:22,830 --> 02:02:22,840
now the question is can you prove how
 

6275
02:02:22,840 --> 02:02:25,169
now the question is can you prove how
random it is so for example one very

6276
02:02:25,169 --> 02:02:25,179
random it is so for example one very
 

6277
02:02:25,179 --> 02:02:27,120
random it is so for example one very
simple question can you prove that and

6278
02:02:27,120 --> 02:02:27,130
simple question can you prove that and
 

6279
02:02:27,130 --> 02:02:29,310
simple question can you prove that and
never repeat nope we haven't been able

6280
02:02:29,310 --> 02:02:29,320
never repeat nope we haven't been able
 

6281
02:02:29,320 --> 02:02:32,490
never repeat nope we haven't been able
to show that will never repeat

6282
02:02:32,490 --> 02:02:32,500
to show that will never repeat
 

6283
02:02:32,500 --> 02:02:34,410
to show that will never repeat
we know that if there are two adjacent

6284
02:02:34,410 --> 02:02:34,420
we know that if there are two adjacent
 

6285
02:02:34,420 --> 02:02:37,110
we know that if there are two adjacent
columns we know they can't both repeat

6286
02:02:37,110 --> 02:02:37,120
columns we know they can't both repeat
 

6287
02:02:37,120 --> 02:02:39,180
columns we know they can't both repeat
but just knowing whether that center

6288
02:02:39,180 --> 02:02:39,190
but just knowing whether that center
 

6289
02:02:39,190 --> 02:02:41,010
but just knowing whether that center
column can ever repeat we still don't

6290
02:02:41,010 --> 02:02:41,020
column can ever repeat we still don't
 

6291
02:02:41,020 --> 02:02:44,220
column can ever repeat we still don't
even know that um another problem that

6292
02:02:44,220 --> 02:02:44,230
even know that um another problem that
 

6293
02:02:44,230 --> 02:02:46,740
even know that um another problem that
I've sort of put in my collection of you

6294
02:02:46,740 --> 02:02:46,750
I've sort of put in my collection of you
 

6295
02:02:46,750 --> 02:02:49,170
I've sort of put in my collection of you
know it's like $30,000 for three you

6296
02:02:49,170 --> 02:02:49,180
know it's like $30,000 for three you
 

6297
02:02:49,180 --> 02:02:51,330
know it's like $30,000 for three you
know for these three prizes for about

6298
02:02:51,330 --> 02:02:51,340
know for these three prizes for about
 

6299
02:02:51,340 --> 02:02:54,660
know for these three prizes for about
rule thirty I would say this is not one

6300
02:02:54,660 --> 02:02:54,670
rule thirty I would say this is not one
 

6301
02:02:54,670 --> 02:02:57,090
rule thirty I would say this is not one
of those is one of those cases where the

6302
02:02:57,090 --> 02:02:57,100
of those is one of those cases where the
 

6303
02:02:57,100 --> 02:02:59,700
of those is one of those cases where the
money is not the main point but it's

6304
02:02:59,700 --> 02:02:59,710
money is not the main point but it's
 

6305
02:02:59,710 --> 02:03:03,150
money is not the main point but it's
just you know helps some motivate

6306
02:03:03,150 --> 02:03:03,160
just you know helps some motivate
 

6307
02:03:03,160 --> 02:03:05,790
just you know helps some motivate
somehow that the investigation so

6308
02:03:05,790 --> 02:03:05,800
somehow that the investigation so
 

6309
02:03:05,800 --> 02:03:07,320
somehow that the investigation so
there's three problems you propose you

6310
02:03:07,320 --> 02:03:07,330
there's three problems you propose you
 

6311
02:03:07,330 --> 02:03:09,300
there's three problems you propose you
get thirty thousand dollars if you solve

6312
02:03:09,300 --> 02:03:09,310
get thirty thousand dollars if you solve
 

6313
02:03:09,310 --> 02:03:11,310
get thirty thousand dollars if you solve
all three or maybe yeah no it's ten

6314
02:03:11,310 --> 02:03:11,320
all three or maybe yeah no it's ten
 

6315
02:03:11,320 --> 02:03:14,010
all three or maybe yeah no it's ten
thousand for each for each a my the

6316
02:03:14,010 --> 02:03:14,020
thousand for each for each a my the
 

6317
02:03:14,020 --> 02:03:15,810
thousand for each for each a my the
problems that's right money's not the

6318
02:03:15,810 --> 02:03:15,820
problems that's right money's not the
 

6319
02:03:15,820 --> 02:03:17,100
problems that's right money's not the
thing the problems themselves are just

6320
02:03:17,100 --> 02:03:17,110
thing the problems themselves are just
 

6321
02:03:17,110 --> 02:03:21,330
thing the problems themselves are just
clean yeah right it's just you know will

6322
02:03:21,330 --> 02:03:21,340
clean yeah right it's just you know will
 

6323
02:03:21,340 --> 02:03:23,400
clean yeah right it's just you know will
it ever become periodic second problem

6324
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:23,410
it ever become periodic second problem
 

6325
02:03:23,410 --> 02:03:25,440
it ever become periodic second problem
is other an equal number of black and

6326
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:25,450
is other an equal number of black and
 

6327
02:03:25,450 --> 02:03:27,270
is other an equal number of black and
white cells down the middle calm down

6328
02:03:27,270 --> 02:03:27,280
white cells down the middle calm down
 

6329
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:28,950
white cells down the middle calm down
the middle column and the third problem

6330
02:03:28,950 --> 02:03:28,960
the middle column and the third problem
 

6331
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:30,530
the middle column and the third problem
is a little bit harder to state which is

6332
02:03:30,530 --> 02:03:30,540
is a little bit harder to state which is
 

6333
02:03:30,540 --> 02:03:32,490
is a little bit harder to state which is
essentially is there a way of figuring

6334
02:03:32,490 --> 02:03:32,500
essentially is there a way of figuring
 

6335
02:03:32,500 --> 02:03:35,880
essentially is there a way of figuring
out what the color of a cell at position

6336
02:03:35,880 --> 02:03:35,890
out what the color of a cell at position
 

6337
02:03:35,890 --> 02:03:39,540
out what the color of a cell at position
T down the center column is in a with a

6338
02:03:39,540 --> 02:03:39,550
T down the center column is in a with a
 

6339
02:03:39,550 --> 02:03:41,910
T down the center column is in a with a
less computational effort than about T

6340
02:03:41,910 --> 02:03:41,920
less computational effort than about T
 

6341
02:03:41,920 --> 02:03:44,760
less computational effort than about T
steps so in other words is there way to

6342
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:44,770
steps so in other words is there way to
 

6343
02:03:44,770 --> 02:03:46,920
steps so in other words is there way to
jump ahead and say I know what this is

6344
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:46,930
jump ahead and say I know what this is
 

6345
02:03:46,930 --> 02:03:49,680
jump ahead and say I know what this is
gonna do you know it's just some

6346
02:03:49,680 --> 02:03:49,690
gonna do you know it's just some
 

6347
02:03:49,690 --> 02:03:53,820
gonna do you know it's just some
mathematical function of T or proving

6348
02:03:53,820 --> 02:03:53,830
mathematical function of T or proving
 

6349
02:03:53,830 --> 02:03:55,740
mathematical function of T or proving
that there is no way or proving there is

6350
02:03:55,740 --> 02:03:55,750
that there is no way or proving there is
 

6351
02:03:55,750 --> 02:03:58,350
that there is no way or proving there is
no way yes but both I mean you know for

6352
02:03:58,350 --> 02:03:58,360
no way yes but both I mean you know for
 

6353
02:03:58,360 --> 02:04:00,030
no way yes but both I mean you know for
any one of these one could prove that

6354
02:04:00,030 --> 02:04:00,040
any one of these one could prove that
 

6355
02:04:00,040 --> 02:04:02,070
any one of these one could prove that
you know one could discover you know we

6356
02:04:02,070 --> 02:04:02,080
you know one could discover you know we
 

6357
02:04:02,080 --> 02:04:03,570
you know one could discover you know we
know what rule thirty does for a billion

6358
02:04:03,570 --> 02:04:03,580
know what rule thirty does for a billion
 

6359
02:04:03,580 --> 02:04:06,270
know what rule thirty does for a billion
steps but and maybe we'll know for a

6360
02:04:06,270 --> 02:04:06,280
steps but and maybe we'll know for a
 

6361
02:04:06,280 --> 02:04:08,880
steps but and maybe we'll know for a
trillion steps before two very long but

6362
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:08,890
trillion steps before two very long but
 

6363
02:04:08,890 --> 02:04:10,860
trillion steps before two very long but
maybe at a quadrillion steps it suddenly

6364
02:04:10,860 --> 02:04:10,870
maybe at a quadrillion steps it suddenly
 

6365
02:04:10,870 --> 02:04:13,230
maybe at a quadrillion steps it suddenly
becomes repetitive you might say how

6366
02:04:13,230 --> 02:04:13,240
becomes repetitive you might say how
 

6367
02:04:13,240 --> 02:04:15,420
becomes repetitive you might say how
could that possibly happen but so when I

6368
02:04:15,420 --> 02:04:15,430
could that possibly happen but so when I
 

6369
02:04:15,430 --> 02:04:17,610
could that possibly happen but so when I
was writing up these prizes I thought

6370
02:04:17,610 --> 02:04:17,620
was writing up these prizes I thought
 

6371
02:04:17,620 --> 02:04:19,530
was writing up these prizes I thought
and this is typical of what happens in

6372
02:04:19,530 --> 02:04:19,540
and this is typical of what happens in
 

6373
02:04:19,540 --> 02:04:21,360
and this is typical of what happens in
the computational universe I thought let

6374
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:21,370
the computational universe I thought let
 

6375
02:04:21,370 --> 02:04:23,940
the computational universe I thought let
me find an example where it looks like

6376
02:04:23,940 --> 02:04:23,950
me find an example where it looks like
 

6377
02:04:23,950 --> 02:04:25,620
me find an example where it looks like
it's just gonna be random forever but

6378
02:04:25,620 --> 02:04:25,630
it's just gonna be random forever but
 

6379
02:04:25,630 --> 02:04:27,510
it's just gonna be random forever but
actually it becomes repetitive yeah and

6380
02:04:27,510 --> 02:04:27,520
actually it becomes repetitive yeah and
 

6381
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:29,520
actually it becomes repetitive yeah and
I found one and it's just you know I did

6382
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:29,530
I found one and it's just you know I did
 

6383
02:04:29,530 --> 02:04:31,920
I found one and it's just you know I did
a search I searched I don't know maybe a

6384
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:31,930
a search I searched I don't know maybe a
 

6385
02:04:31,930 --> 02:04:33,810
a search I searched I don't know maybe a
million different rules with some

6386
02:04:33,810 --> 02:04:33,820
million different rules with some
 

6387
02:04:33,820 --> 02:04:36,930
million different rules with some
criterion and this is what's sort of

6388
02:04:36,930 --> 02:04:36,940
criterion and this is what's sort of
 

6389
02:04:36,940 --> 02:04:39,390
criterion and this is what's sort of
interesting about that is I kind of have

6390
02:04:39,390 --> 02:04:39,400
interesting about that is I kind of have
 

6391
02:04:39,400 --> 02:04:42,030
interesting about that is I kind of have
this thing that I per se got a silly way

6392
02:04:42,030 --> 02:04:42,040
this thing that I per se got a silly way
 

6393
02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:43,560
this thing that I per se got a silly way
about the computational universe which

6394
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:43,570
about the computational universe which
 

6395
02:04:43,570 --> 02:04:45,300
about the computational universe which
is you know the animals are always

6396
02:04:45,300 --> 02:04:45,310
is you know the animals are always
 

6397
02:04:45,310 --> 02:04:46,199
is you know the animals are always
smarter than you

6398
02:04:46,199 --> 02:04:46,209
smarter than you
 

6399
02:04:46,209 --> 02:04:47,969
smarter than you
that is there's always some way one of

6400
02:04:47,969 --> 02:04:47,979
that is there's always some way one of
 

6401
02:04:47,979 --> 02:04:49,439
that is there's always some way one of
these computational systems is gonna

6402
02:04:49,439 --> 02:04:49,449
these computational systems is gonna
 

6403
02:04:49,449 --> 02:04:51,299
these computational systems is gonna
figure out how to do something even

6404
02:04:51,299 --> 02:04:51,309
figure out how to do something even
 

6405
02:04:51,309 --> 02:04:52,890
figure out how to do something even
though I can't imagine how its gonna do

6406
02:04:52,890 --> 02:04:52,900
though I can't imagine how its gonna do
 

6407
02:04:52,900 --> 02:04:54,629
though I can't imagine how its gonna do
it and you know I didn't think I would

6408
02:04:54,629 --> 02:04:54,639
it and you know I didn't think I would
 

6409
02:04:54,639 --> 02:04:56,489
it and you know I didn't think I would
find one that you know you would think

6410
02:04:56,489 --> 02:04:56,499
find one that you know you would think
 

6411
02:04:56,499 --> 02:04:57,929
find one that you know you would think
of for all these years that what I found

6412
02:04:57,929 --> 02:04:57,939
of for all these years that what I found
 

6413
02:04:57,939 --> 02:05:02,219
of for all these years that what I found
sort of all possible things funky things

6414
02:05:02,219 --> 02:05:02,229
sort of all possible things funky things
 

6415
02:05:02,229 --> 02:05:05,759
sort of all possible things funky things
that that I would have that I would have

6416
02:05:05,759 --> 02:05:05,769
that that I would have that I would have
 

6417
02:05:05,769 --> 02:05:07,799
that that I would have that I would have
gotten my intuition wrapped around the

6418
02:05:07,799 --> 02:05:07,809
gotten my intuition wrapped around the
 

6419
02:05:07,809 --> 02:05:11,189
gotten my intuition wrapped around the
idea that you know these creatures are

6420
02:05:11,189 --> 02:05:11,199
idea that you know these creatures are
 

6421
02:05:11,199 --> 02:05:12,810
idea that you know these creatures are
always in the computational universe are

6422
02:05:12,810 --> 02:05:12,820
always in the computational universe are
 

6423
02:05:12,820 --> 02:05:15,359
always in the computational universe are
always smarter than I'm gonna be but you

6424
02:05:15,359 --> 02:05:15,369
always smarter than I'm gonna be but you
 

6425
02:05:15,369 --> 02:05:16,949
always smarter than I'm gonna be but you
know they're equivalently yes Mari

6426
02:05:16,949 --> 02:05:16,959
know they're equivalently yes Mari
 

6427
02:05:16,959 --> 02:05:19,979
know they're equivalently yes Mari
that's correct and that makes it that

6428
02:05:19,979 --> 02:05:19,989
that's correct and that makes it that
 

6429
02:05:19,989 --> 02:05:22,140
that's correct and that makes it that
makes one feel very sort of it's it's

6430
02:05:22,140 --> 02:05:22,150
makes one feel very sort of it's it's
 

6431
02:05:22,150 --> 02:05:24,449
makes one feel very sort of it's it's
it's humbling every time because every

6432
02:05:24,449 --> 02:05:24,459
it's humbling every time because every
 

6433
02:05:24,459 --> 02:05:27,209
it's humbling every time because every
time the thing is is you know you think

6434
02:05:27,209 --> 02:05:27,219
time the thing is is you know you think
 

6435
02:05:27,219 --> 02:05:28,560
time the thing is is you know you think
it's gonna do this so it's not gonna be

6436
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:28,570
it's gonna do this so it's not gonna be
 

6437
02:05:28,570 --> 02:05:30,600
it's gonna do this so it's not gonna be
possible to do this and it turns out it

6438
02:05:30,600 --> 02:05:30,610
possible to do this and it turns out it
 

6439
02:05:30,610 --> 02:05:32,520
possible to do this and it turns out it
finds a way of course the promising

6440
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:32,530
finds a way of course the promising
 

6441
02:05:32,530 --> 02:05:34,080
finds a way of course the promising
thing is there's a lot of other rules

6442
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:34,090
thing is there's a lot of other rules
 

6443
02:05:34,090 --> 02:05:34,949
thing is there's a lot of other rules
like rule 30

6444
02:05:34,949 --> 02:05:34,959
like rule 30
 

6445
02:05:34,959 --> 02:05:38,399
like rule 30
it's just rule 30 is oh it's my favorite

6446
02:05:38,399 --> 02:05:38,409
it's just rule 30 is oh it's my favorite
 

6447
02:05:38,409 --> 02:05:40,049
it's just rule 30 is oh it's my favorite
because I found it first and that's

6448
02:05:40,049 --> 02:05:40,059
because I found it first and that's
 

6449
02:05:40,059 --> 02:05:42,359
because I found it first and that's
right but the problems are focusing on

6450
02:05:42,359 --> 02:05:42,369
right but the problems are focusing on
 

6451
02:05:42,369 --> 02:05:45,779
right but the problems are focusing on
rule 30 it's possible that rule 30 is is

6452
02:05:45,779 --> 02:05:45,789
rule 30 it's possible that rule 30 is is
 

6453
02:05:45,789 --> 02:05:48,929
rule 30 it's possible that rule 30 is is
repetitive after trillion steps and that

6454
02:05:48,929 --> 02:05:48,939
repetitive after trillion steps and that
 

6455
02:05:48,939 --> 02:05:50,129
repetitive after trillion steps and that
doesn't prove anything about the other

6456
02:05:50,129 --> 02:05:50,139
doesn't prove anything about the other
 

6457
02:05:50,139 --> 02:05:52,259
doesn't prove anything about the other
rules it does not but this is a good

6458
02:05:52,259 --> 02:05:52,269
rules it does not but this is a good
 

6459
02:05:52,269 --> 02:05:54,870
rules it does not but this is a good
sort of experiment of how you go about

6460
02:05:54,870 --> 02:05:54,880
sort of experiment of how you go about
 

6461
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:56,819
sort of experiment of how you go about
trying to prove something about a stick

6462
02:05:56,819 --> 02:05:56,829
trying to prove something about a stick
 

6463
02:05:56,829 --> 02:05:58,770
trying to prove something about a stick
you'll rule yes and it also all these

6464
02:05:58,770 --> 02:05:58,780
you'll rule yes and it also all these
 

6465
02:05:58,780 --> 02:06:00,929
you'll rule yes and it also all these
things help build intuition that is

6466
02:06:00,929 --> 02:06:00,939
things help build intuition that is
 

6467
02:06:00,939 --> 02:06:02,459
things help build intuition that is
intact if it turned out that this was

6468
02:06:02,459 --> 02:06:02,469
intact if it turned out that this was
 

6469
02:06:02,469 --> 02:06:05,250
intact if it turned out that this was
repetitive tore trillion steps that's

6470
02:06:05,250 --> 02:06:05,260
repetitive tore trillion steps that's
 

6471
02:06:05,260 --> 02:06:08,040
repetitive tore trillion steps that's
not what I would expect and so we

6472
02:06:08,040 --> 02:06:08,050
not what I would expect and so we
 

6473
02:06:08,050 --> 02:06:09,929
not what I would expect and so we
learned something from that the method

6474
02:06:09,929 --> 02:06:09,939
learned something from that the method
 

6475
02:06:09,939 --> 02:06:11,969
learned something from that the method
to do that though would reveal something

6476
02:06:11,969 --> 02:06:11,979
to do that though would reveal something
 

6477
02:06:11,979 --> 02:06:14,759
to do that though would reveal something
interesting about the so no doubt no

6478
02:06:14,759 --> 02:06:14,769
interesting about the so no doubt no
 

6479
02:06:14,769 --> 02:06:15,149
interesting about the so no doubt no
doubt

6480
02:06:15,149 --> 02:06:15,159
doubt
 

6481
02:06:15,159 --> 02:06:17,759
doubt
I mean it's although it's sometimes

6482
02:06:17,759 --> 02:06:17,769
I mean it's although it's sometimes
 

6483
02:06:17,769 --> 02:06:19,290
I mean it's although it's sometimes
challenging like the you know I put out

6484
02:06:19,290 --> 02:06:19,300
challenging like the you know I put out
 

6485
02:06:19,300 --> 02:06:23,279
challenging like the you know I put out
a prize in 2007 for for a particular

a prize in 2007 for for a particular
 

6487
02:06:23,289 --> 02:06:26,040
a prize in 2007 for for a particular
Turing machine that I there was the

6488
02:06:26,040 --> 02:06:26,050
Turing machine that I there was the
 

6489
02:06:26,050 --> 02:06:27,540
Turing machine that I there was the
simplest candidate for being the

6490
02:06:27,540 --> 02:06:27,550
simplest candidate for being the
 

6491
02:06:27,550 --> 02:06:30,060
simplest candidate for being the
universal Turing machine and the young

6495
02:06:33,699 --> 02:06:35,879
chap in England named Alex Smith after a
smallish number of months said I've got

6496
02:06:35,879 --> 02:06:35,889
smallish number of months said I've got
 

6497
02:06:35,889 --> 02:06:37,770
smallish number of months said I've got
a proof and he did you know I took a

6498
02:06:37,770 --> 02:06:37,780
a proof and he did you know I took a
 

6499
02:06:37,780 --> 02:06:39,479
a proof and he did you know I took a
little while to iterate but you had a

6500
02:06:39,479 --> 02:06:39,489
little while to iterate but you had a
 

6501
02:06:39,489 --> 02:06:42,560
little while to iterate but you had a
proof unfortunately the proof is very

6502
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:42,570
proof unfortunately the proof is very
 

6503
02:06:42,570 --> 02:06:46,049

it's it's a lot of micro details it's

6504
02:06:46,049 --> 02:06:46,059
it's it's a lot of micro details it's
 

6505
02:06:46,059 --> 02:06:48,209
it's it's a lot of micro details it's
it's not it's not like you look at it

6506
02:06:48,209 --> 02:06:48,219
it's not it's not like you look at it
 

6507
02:06:48,219 --> 02:06:51,089
it's not it's not like you look at it
you say aha there's a big new principle

6508
02:06:51,089 --> 02:06:51,099
you say aha there's a big new principle
 

6509
02:06:51,099 --> 02:06:54,270
you say aha there's a big new principle
the big new principle is the simplest

6510
02:06:54,270 --> 02:06:54,280
the big new principle is the simplest
 

6511
02:06:54,280 --> 02:06:55,529
the big new principle is the simplest
Turing machine that might have been

6512

discussion of physics underlying
everything but we we talked about the

6670
02:09:59,550 --> 02:09:59,560
everything but we we talked about the
 

6671
02:09:59,560 --> 02:10:02,080
everything but we we talked about the
potential equivalents of the fundamental

6672
02:10:02,080 --> 02:10:02,090
potential equivalents of the fundamental
 

6673
02:10:02,090 --> 02:10:03,610
potential equivalents of the fundamental
laws of physics and the kind of

6674
02:10:03,610 --> 02:10:03,620
laws of physics and the kind of
 

6675
02:10:03,620 --> 02:10:10,620
laws of physics and the kind of
computation going on internal machinery

6676
02:10:10,620 --> 02:10:10,630

 

6677
02:10:10,630 --> 02:10:12,460

interesting about the kind of

6678
02:10:12,460 --> 02:10:12,470
interesting about the kind of
 

6679
02:10:12,470 --> 02:10:15,790
interesting about the kind of
computation that our bodies do right

6680
02:10:15,790 --> 02:10:15,800
computation that our bodies do right
 

6681
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:17,770
computation that our bodies do right
well let's talk about brains primary

6682
02:10:17,770 --> 02:10:17,780
well let's talk about brains primary
 

6683
02:10:17,780 --> 02:10:21,190
well let's talk about brains primary
range the the I mean I think the the

6684
02:10:21,190 --> 02:10:21,200
range the the I mean I think the the
 

6685
02:10:21,200 --> 02:10:22,810
range the the I mean I think the the
most important thing about the things

6686
02:10:22,810 --> 02:10:22,820
most important thing about the things
 

6687
02:10:22,820 --> 02:10:24,580
most important thing about the things
that our brains do that we care about

6688
02:10:24,580 --> 02:10:24,590
that our brains do that we care about
 

6689
02:10:24,590 --> 02:10:27,070
that our brains do that we care about
them in the sense that there's a lot of

6690
02:10:27,070 --> 02:10:27,080
them in the sense that there's a lot of
 

6691
02:10:27,080 --> 02:10:29,740
them in the sense that there's a lot of
computation going on out there in you

6692
02:10:29,740 --> 02:10:29,750
computation going on out there in you
 

6693
02:10:29,750 --> 02:10:32,170
computation going on out there in you
know cellular automata and and you know

6694
02:10:32,170 --> 02:10:32,180
know cellular automata and and you know
 

6695
02:10:32,180 --> 02:10:34,630
know cellular automata and and you know
physical systems and so on and it just

6696
02:10:34,630 --> 02:10:34,640
physical systems and so on and it just
 

6697
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:36,220
physical systems and so on and it just
it does what it does it follows those

6698
02:10:36,220 --> 02:10:36,230
it does what it does it follows those
 

6699
02:10:36,230 --> 02:10:37,750
it does what it does it follows those
rules it does what it does

6700
02:10:37,750 --> 02:10:37,760
rules it does what it does
 

6701
02:10:37,760 --> 02:10:39,550
rules it does what it does
the thing that's special about the

6702
02:10:39,550 --> 02:10:39,560
the thing that's special about the
 

6703
02:10:39,560 --> 02:10:41,710
the thing that's special about the
computation in our brains is that it's

6704
02:10:41,710 --> 02:10:41,720
computation in our brains is that it's
 

6705
02:10:41,720 --> 02:10:44,920
computation in our brains is that it's
connected to our goals and our current

6706
02:10:44,920 --> 02:10:44,930
connected to our goals and our current
 

6707
02:10:44,930 --> 02:10:47,890
connected to our goals and our current
whole societal story and you know I

6708
02:10:47,890 --> 02:10:47,900
whole societal story and you know I
 

6709
02:10:47,900 --> 02:10:50,050
whole societal story and you know I
think that's the that's that's the

6710
02:10:50,050 --> 02:10:50,060
think that's the that's that's the
 

6711
02:10:50,060 --> 02:10:52,060
think that's the that's that's the
special feature and now the question

6712
02:10:52,060 --> 02:10:52,070
special feature and now the question
 

6713
02:10:52,070 --> 02:10:53,560
special feature and now the question
then is when you see this whole sort of

6714
02:10:53,560 --> 02:10:53,570
then is when you see this whole sort of
 

6715
02:10:53,570 --> 02:10:55,810
then is when you see this whole sort of
ocean of computation out there how do

6716
02:10:55,810 --> 02:10:55,820
ocean of computation out there how do
 

6717
02:10:55,820 --> 02:10:57,880
ocean of computation out there how do
you connect that to the things that we

6718
02:10:57,880 --> 02:10:57,890
you connect that to the things that we
 

6719
02:10:57,890 --> 02:11:00,520
you connect that to the things that we
humans care about and in a sense a large

6720
02:11:00,520 --> 02:11:00,530
humans care about and in a sense a large
 

6721
02:11:00,530 --> 02:11:02,170
humans care about and in a sense a large
part of my life has been involved in

6722
02:11:02,170 --> 02:11:02,180
part of my life has been involved in
 

6723
02:11:02,180 --> 02:11:03,730
part of my life has been involved in
sort of the technology of how to do that

6724
02:11:03,730 --> 02:11:03,740
sort of the technology of how to do that
 

6725
02:11:03,740 --> 02:11:06,070
sort of the technology of how to do that
and you know what I've been interested

6726
02:11:06,070 --> 02:11:06,080
and you know what I've been interested
 

6727
02:11:06,080 --> 02:11:07,990
and you know what I've been interested
in is kind of building computational

6728
02:11:07,990 --> 02:11:08,000
in is kind of building computational
 

6729
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,270
in is kind of building computational
language that allows that something that

6730
02:11:10,270 --> 02:11:10,280
language that allows that something that
 

6731
02:11:10,280 --> 02:11:13,510
language that allows that something that
both we humans can understand and that

6732
02:11:13,510 --> 02:11:13,520
both we humans can understand and that
 

6733
02:11:13,520 --> 02:11:16,360
both we humans can understand and that
can be used to determine computations

6734
02:11:16,360 --> 02:11:16,370
can be used to determine computations
 

6735
02:11:16,370 --> 02:11:18,190
can be used to determine computations
that are actually computations we care

6736
02:11:18,190 --> 02:11:18,200
that are actually computations we care
 

6737
02:11:18,200 --> 02:11:20,500
that are actually computations we care
about see I think when you look at

6738
02:11:20,500 --> 02:11:20,510
about see I think when you look at
 

6739
02:11:20,510 --> 02:11:21,640
about see I think when you look at
something like one of these cellular

6740
02:11:21,640 --> 02:11:21,650
something like one of these cellular
 

6741
02:11:21,650 --> 02:11:23,860
something like one of these cellular
automata and it does some complicated

6742
02:11:23,860 --> 02:11:23,870
automata and it does some complicated
 

6743
02:11:23,870 --> 02:11:25,589
automata and it does some complicated
thing you say

6744
02:11:25,589 --> 02:11:25,599
thing you say
 

6745
02:11:25,599 --> 02:11:28,500
thing you say
that's fun but why do I care well you

6746
02:11:28,500 --> 02:11:28,510
that's fun but why do I care well you
 

6747
02:11:28,510 --> 02:11:30,119
that's fun but why do I care well you
could say the same thing actually in

6748
02:11:30,119 --> 02:11:30,129
could say the same thing actually in
 

6749
02:11:30,129 --> 02:11:32,639
could say the same thing actually in
physics you say oh I've got this

6750
02:11:32,639 --> 02:11:32,649
physics you say oh I've got this
 

6751
02:11:32,649 --> 02:11:34,619
physics you say oh I've got this
material and it's a ferrite or something

6752
02:11:34,619 --> 02:11:34,629
material and it's a ferrite or something
 

6753
02:11:34,629 --> 02:11:36,899
material and it's a ferrite or something
why do I care you know it's some has

6754
02:11:36,899 --> 02:11:36,909
why do I care you know it's some has
 

6755
02:11:36,909 --> 02:11:38,879
why do I care you know it's some has
some magnetic properties why do I care

6756
02:11:38,879 --> 02:11:38,889
some magnetic properties why do I care
 

6757
02:11:38,889 --> 02:11:40,560
some magnetic properties why do I care
it's amusing but why do I care

6758
02:11:40,560 --> 02:11:40,570
it's amusing but why do I care
 

6759
02:11:40,570 --> 02:11:42,629
it's amusing but why do I care
well we end up caring because you know

6760
02:11:42,629 --> 02:11:42,639
well we end up caring because you know
 

6761
02:11:42,639 --> 02:11:44,429
well we end up caring because you know
ferrite is what's used to make magnetic

6762
02:11:44,429 --> 02:11:44,439
ferrite is what's used to make magnetic
 

6763
02:11:44,439 --> 02:11:46,799
ferrite is what's used to make magnetic
tape magnetic disks whatever or you know

6764
02:11:46,799 --> 02:11:46,809
tape magnetic disks whatever or you know
 

6765
02:11:46,809 --> 02:11:48,359
tape magnetic disks whatever or you know
we could use the coke crystals as made

6766
02:11:48,359 --> 02:11:48,369
we could use the coke crystals as made
 

6767
02:11:48,369 --> 02:11:51,089
we could use the coke crystals as made
used to make um well not that she

6768
02:11:51,089 --> 02:11:51,099
used to make um well not that she
 

6769
02:11:51,099 --> 02:11:53,009
used to make um well not that she
increasingly not but it has been used to

6770
02:11:53,009 --> 02:11:53,019
increasingly not but it has been used to
 

6771
02:11:53,019 --> 02:11:55,859
increasingly not but it has been used to
make computer displays and so on but

6772
02:11:55,859 --> 02:11:55,869
make computer displays and so on but
 

6773
02:11:55,869 --> 02:11:57,719
make computer displays and so on but
those are so in a sense where mining

6774
02:11:57,719 --> 02:11:57,729
those are so in a sense where mining
 

6775
02:11:57,729 --> 02:12:00,000
those are so in a sense where mining
these things that happen to exist in the

6776
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:00,010
these things that happen to exist in the
 

6777
02:12:00,010 --> 02:12:02,819
these things that happen to exist in the
physical universe and I'm making it be

6778
02:12:02,819 --> 02:12:02,829
physical universe and I'm making it be
 

6779
02:12:02,829 --> 02:12:04,319
physical universe and I'm making it be
something that we care about because we

6780
02:12:04,319 --> 02:12:04,329
something that we care about because we
 

6781
02:12:04,329 --> 02:12:06,359
something that we care about because we
sort of in train it into technology and

6782
02:12:06,359 --> 02:12:06,369
sort of in train it into technology and
 

6783
02:12:06,369 --> 02:12:08,520
sort of in train it into technology and
it's the same thing in the computational

6784
02:12:08,520 --> 02:12:08,530
it's the same thing in the computational
 

6785
02:12:08,530 --> 02:12:10,830
it's the same thing in the computational
universe that a lot of what's out there

6786
02:12:10,830 --> 02:12:10,840
universe that a lot of what's out there
 

6787
02:12:10,840 --> 02:12:14,189
universe that a lot of what's out there
is stuff that's just happening but

6788
02:12:14,189 --> 02:12:14,199
is stuff that's just happening but
 

6789
02:12:14,199 --> 02:12:16,770
is stuff that's just happening but
sometimes we have some objective and we

6790
02:12:16,770 --> 02:12:16,780
sometimes we have some objective and we
 

6791
02:12:16,780 --> 02:12:18,119
sometimes we have some objective and we
will go and sort of mine the

6792
02:12:18,119 --> 02:12:18,129
will go and sort of mine the
 

6793
02:12:18,129 --> 02:12:19,589
will go and sort of mine the
computational universe for something

6794
02:12:19,589 --> 02:12:19,599
computational universe for something
 

6795
02:12:19,599 --> 02:12:20,609
computational universe for something
that's useful for some particular

6796
02:12:20,609 --> 02:12:20,619
that's useful for some particular
 

6797
02:12:20,619 --> 02:12:24,000
that's useful for some particular
objective on a large scale trying to do

6798
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:24,010
objective on a large scale trying to do
 

6799
02:12:24,010 --> 02:12:26,129
objective on a large scale trying to do
that trying to sort of navigate the

6800
02:12:26,129 --> 02:12:26,139
that trying to sort of navigate the
 

6801
02:12:26,139 --> 02:12:27,419
that trying to sort of navigate the
computational universe to do useful

6802
02:12:27,419 --> 02:12:27,429
computational universe to do useful
 

6803
02:12:27,429 --> 02:12:29,669
computational universe to do useful
things you know that's where

6804
02:12:29,669 --> 02:12:29,679
things you know that's where
 

6805
02:12:29,679 --> 02:12:32,310
things you know that's where
computational language comes in and you

6806
02:12:32,310 --> 02:12:32,320
computational language comes in and you
 

6807
02:12:32,320 --> 02:12:34,169
computational language comes in and you
know a lot of what I've spent time doing

6808
02:12:34,169 --> 02:12:34,179
know a lot of what I've spent time doing
 

6809
02:12:34,179 --> 02:12:36,239
know a lot of what I've spent time doing
and building this thing we call Wolfram

6810
02:12:36,239 --> 02:12:36,249
and building this thing we call Wolfram
 

6811
02:12:36,249 --> 02:12:38,429
and building this thing we call Wolfram
language which I've been building for

6812
02:12:38,429 --> 02:12:38,439
language which I've been building for
 

6813
02:12:38,439 --> 02:12:41,689
language which I've been building for
the last one third of a century now and

6814
02:12:41,689 --> 02:12:41,699
the last one third of a century now and
 

6815
02:12:41,699 --> 02:12:46,409
the last one third of a century now and
kind of the goal there is to have a way

6816
02:12:46,409 --> 02:12:46,419
kind of the goal there is to have a way
 

6817
02:12:46,419 --> 02:12:49,109
kind of the goal there is to have a way
to express kind of computational

6818
02:12:49,109 --> 02:12:49,119
to express kind of computational
 

6819
02:12:49,119 --> 02:12:51,839
to express kind of computational
thinking computational thoughts in a way

6820
02:12:51,839 --> 02:12:51,849
thinking computational thoughts in a way
 

6821
02:12:51,849 --> 02:12:53,459
thinking computational thoughts in a way
that both humans and machines can

6822
02:12:53,459 --> 02:12:53,469
that both humans and machines can
 

6823
02:12:53,469 --> 02:12:56,099
that both humans and machines can
understand so it's kind of like in the

6824
02:12:56,099 --> 02:12:56,109
understand so it's kind of like in the
 

6825
02:12:56,109 --> 02:12:57,479
understand so it's kind of like in the
tradition of computer languages

6826
02:12:57,479 --> 02:12:57,489
tradition of computer languages
 

6827
02:12:57,489 --> 02:13:00,989
tradition of computer languages
programming languages that the tradition

6828
02:13:00,989 --> 02:13:00,999
programming languages that the tradition
 

6829
02:13:00,999 --> 02:13:03,629
programming languages that the tradition
there has been more let's take what how

6830
02:13:03,629 --> 02:13:03,639
there has been more let's take what how
 

6831
02:13:03,639 --> 02:13:06,330
there has been more let's take what how
computers are built and let's specify

6832
02:13:06,330 --> 02:13:06,340
computers are built and let's specify
 

6833
02:13:06,340 --> 02:13:09,000
computers are built and let's specify
let's have a human way to specify do

6834
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:09,010
let's have a human way to specify do
 

6835
02:13:09,010 --> 02:13:11,729
let's have a human way to specify do
this do this do this at the level of the

6836
02:13:11,729 --> 02:13:11,739
this do this do this at the level of the
 

6837
02:13:11,739 --> 02:13:13,529
this do this do this at the level of the
way that computers are built what I've

6838
02:13:13,529 --> 02:13:13,539
way that computers are built what I've
 

6839
02:13:13,539 --> 02:13:15,779
way that computers are built what I've
been interested in is representing sort

6840
02:13:15,779 --> 02:13:15,789
been interested in is representing sort
 

6841
02:13:15,789 --> 02:13:17,909
been interested in is representing sort
of the whole world computationally and

6842
02:13:17,909 --> 02:13:17,919
of the whole world computationally and
 

6843
02:13:17,919 --> 02:13:20,009
of the whole world computationally and
being able to talk about whether it's

6844
02:13:20,009 --> 02:13:20,019
being able to talk about whether it's
 

6845
02:13:20,019 --> 02:13:22,709
being able to talk about whether it's
about cities or chemicals or you know

6846
02:13:22,709 --> 02:13:22,719
about cities or chemicals or you know
 

6847
02:13:22,719 --> 02:13:24,119
about cities or chemicals or you know
this kind of algorithm or that kind of

6848
02:13:24,119 --> 02:13:24,129
this kind of algorithm or that kind of
 

6849
02:13:24,129 --> 02:13:26,969
this kind of algorithm or that kind of
algorithm things that have come to exist

6850
02:13:26,969 --> 02:13:26,979
algorithm things that have come to exist
 

6851
02:13:26,979 --> 02:13:28,709
algorithm things that have come to exist
in our civilization and the sort of

6852
02:13:28,709 --> 02:13:28,719
in our civilization and the sort of
 

6853
02:13:28,719 --> 02:13:30,810
in our civilization and the sort of
knowledge base of our civilization being

6854
02:13:30,810 --> 02:13:30,820
knowledge base of our civilization being
 

6855
02:13:30,820 --> 02:13:32,939
knowledge base of our civilization being
able to talk directly about those in a

6856
02:13:32,939 --> 02:13:32,949
able to talk directly about those in a
 

6857
02:13:32,949 --> 02:13:35,790
able to talk directly about those in a
computational language so that both we

6858
02:13:35,790 --> 02:13:35,800
computational language so that both we
 

6859
02:13:35,800 --> 02:13:37,619
computational language so that both we
can understand it and computers can

6860
02:13:37,619 --> 02:13:37,629
can understand it and computers can
 

6861
02:13:37,629 --> 02:13:38,350
can understand it and computers can
understand

6862
02:13:38,350 --> 02:13:38,360
understand
 

6863
02:13:38,360 --> 02:13:41,169
understand
I mean the thing that I've been sort of

6864
02:13:41,169 --> 02:13:41,179
I mean the thing that I've been sort of
 

6865
02:13:41,179 --> 02:13:42,700
I mean the thing that I've been sort of
excited about recently which I had only

6866
02:13:42,700 --> 02:13:42,710
excited about recently which I had only
 

6867
02:13:42,710 --> 02:13:44,260
excited about recently which I had only
realized recently which is kind of

6868
02:13:44,260 --> 02:13:44,270
realized recently which is kind of
 

6869
02:13:44,270 --> 02:13:46,899
realized recently which is kind of
embarrassing but trim is kind of the the

6870
02:13:46,899 --> 02:13:46,909
embarrassing but trim is kind of the the
 

6871
02:13:46,909 --> 02:13:48,459
embarrassing but trim is kind of the the
arc of what we've tried to do in

6872
02:13:48,459 --> 02:13:48,469
arc of what we've tried to do in
 

6873
02:13:48,469 --> 02:13:49,899
arc of what we've tried to do in
building this kind of computational

6874
02:13:49,899 --> 02:13:49,909
building this kind of computational
 

6875
02:13:49,909 --> 02:13:52,870
building this kind of computational
language is it's a similar kind of arc

6876
02:13:52,870 --> 02:13:52,880
language is it's a similar kind of arc
 

6877
02:13:52,880 --> 02:13:55,270
language is it's a similar kind of arc
of what happened when mathematical

6878
02:13:55,270 --> 02:13:55,280
of what happened when mathematical
 

6879
02:13:55,280 --> 02:13:59,590
of what happened when mathematical
notation was invented so go back 400

6880
02:13:59,590 --> 02:13:59,600
notation was invented so go back 400
 

6881
02:13:59,600 --> 02:14:01,840
notation was invented so go back 400
years people were trying to do math they

6882
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:01,850
years people were trying to do math they
 

6883
02:14:01,850 --> 02:14:03,520
years people were trying to do math they
were always explaining their math in

6884
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:03,530
were always explaining their math in
 

6885
02:14:03,530 --> 02:14:07,180
were always explaining their math in
words and it was pretty conky and as

6886
02:14:07,180 --> 02:14:07,190
words and it was pretty conky and as
 

6887
02:14:07,190 --> 02:14:08,680
words and it was pretty conky and as
soon as mathematical notation was

6888
02:14:08,680 --> 02:14:08,690
soon as mathematical notation was
 

6889
02:14:08,690 --> 02:14:11,620
soon as mathematical notation was
invented you could start defining things

6890
02:14:11,620 --> 02:14:11,630
invented you could start defining things
 

6891
02:14:11,630 --> 02:14:13,450
invented you could start defining things
like algebra and later calculus and so

6892
02:14:13,450 --> 02:14:13,460
like algebra and later calculus and so
 

6893
02:14:13,460 --> 02:14:14,910
like algebra and later calculus and so
on it all became much more streamlined

6894
02:14:14,910 --> 02:14:14,920
on it all became much more streamlined
 

6895
02:14:14,920 --> 02:14:17,379
on it all became much more streamlined
when we deal with computational thinking

6896
02:14:17,379 --> 02:14:17,389
when we deal with computational thinking
 

6897
02:14:17,389 --> 02:14:19,750
when we deal with computational thinking
about the world there's a question of

6898
02:14:19,750 --> 02:14:19,760
about the world there's a question of
 

6899
02:14:19,760 --> 02:14:21,609
about the world there's a question of
what is the notation what is the what is

6900
02:14:21,609 --> 02:14:21,619
what is the notation what is the what is
 

6901
02:14:21,619 --> 02:14:23,830
what is the notation what is the what is
the kind of formalism that we can use to

6902
02:14:23,830 --> 02:14:23,840
the kind of formalism that we can use to
 

6903
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:26,320
the kind of formalism that we can use to
talk about the world computationally and

6904
02:14:26,320 --> 02:14:26,330
talk about the world computationally and
 

6905
02:14:26,330 --> 02:14:28,300
talk about the world computationally and
in a sense that's what I've spent the

6906
02:14:28,300 --> 02:14:28,310
in a sense that's what I've spent the
 

6907
02:14:28,310 --> 02:14:29,770
in a sense that's what I've spent the
last third of a century trying to build

6908
02:14:29,770 --> 02:14:29,780
last third of a century trying to build
 

6909
02:14:29,780 --> 02:14:31,720
last third of a century trying to build
and we finally got to the point where we

6910
02:14:31,720 --> 02:14:31,730
and we finally got to the point where we
 

6911
02:14:31,730 --> 02:14:33,520
and we finally got to the point where we
have a pretty full scale computational

6912
02:14:33,520 --> 02:14:33,530
have a pretty full scale computational
 

6913
02:14:33,530 --> 02:14:35,439
have a pretty full scale computational
language that sort of talks about the

6914
02:14:35,439 --> 02:14:35,449
language that sort of talks about the
 

6915
02:14:35,449 --> 02:14:38,410
language that sort of talks about the
world and that's that's exciting because

6916
02:14:38,410 --> 02:14:38,420
world and that's that's exciting because
 

6917
02:14:38,420 --> 02:14:41,709
world and that's that's exciting because
it means that just like having this

6918
02:14:41,709 --> 02:14:41,719
it means that just like having this
 

6919
02:14:41,719 --> 02:14:43,629
it means that just like having this
mathematical notation let us talk about

6920
02:14:43,629 --> 02:14:43,639
mathematical notation let us talk about
 

6921
02:14:43,639 --> 02:14:46,390
mathematical notation let us talk about
the world mathematically we now and and

6922
02:14:46,390 --> 02:14:46,400
the world mathematically we now and and
 

6923
02:14:46,400 --> 02:14:48,129
the world mathematically we now and and
let us built up build up these kind of

6924
02:14:48,129 --> 02:14:48,139
let us built up build up these kind of
 

6925
02:14:48,139 --> 02:14:51,100
let us built up build up these kind of
mathematical sciences now we have a

6926
02:14:51,100 --> 02:14:51,110
mathematical sciences now we have a
 

6927
02:14:51,110 --> 02:14:52,810
mathematical sciences now we have a
computational language which allows us

6928
02:14:52,810 --> 02:14:52,820
computational language which allows us
 

6929
02:14:52,820 --> 02:14:54,330
computational language which allows us
to start talking about the world

6930
02:14:54,330 --> 02:14:54,340
to start talking about the world
 

6931
02:14:54,340 --> 02:14:57,070
to start talking about the world
computationally and lets us you know my

6932
02:14:57,070 --> 02:14:57,080
computationally and lets us you know my
 

6933
02:14:57,080 --> 02:14:59,290
computationally and lets us you know my
view of it is it's kind of computational

6934
02:14:59,290 --> 02:14:59,300
view of it is it's kind of computational
 

6935
02:14:59,300 --> 02:15:02,290
view of it is it's kind of computational
X for all X all these different fields

6936
02:15:02,290 --> 02:15:02,300
X for all X all these different fields
 

6937
02:15:02,300 --> 02:15:04,209
X for all X all these different fields
of you know computational this

6938
02:15:04,209 --> 02:15:04,219
of you know computational this
 

6939
02:15:04,219 --> 02:15:06,340
of you know computational this
computational that that's what we can

6940
02:15:06,340 --> 02:15:06,350
computational that that's what we can
 

6941
02:15:06,350 --> 02:15:08,560
computational that that's what we can
now build let's step back so first of

6942
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:08,570
now build let's step back so first of
 

6943
02:15:08,570 --> 02:15:10,919
now build let's step back so first of
all the mundane

6944
02:15:10,919 --> 02:15:10,929
all the mundane
 

6945
02:15:10,929 --> 02:15:14,729
all the mundane
what is Wolfram language in terms of

6946
02:15:14,729 --> 02:15:14,739
what is Wolfram language in terms of
 

6947
02:15:14,739 --> 02:15:17,859
what is Wolfram language in terms of
sort of I mean I can answer the question

6948
02:15:17,859 --> 02:15:17,869
sort of I mean I can answer the question
 

6949
02:15:17,869 --> 02:15:20,979
sort of I mean I can answer the question
for you but this it basically not the

6950
02:15:20,979 --> 02:15:20,989
for you but this it basically not the
 

6951
02:15:20,989 --> 02:15:22,990
for you but this it basically not the
philosophical deep to profound the

6952
02:15:22,990 --> 02:15:23,000
philosophical deep to profound the
 

6953
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
philosophical deep to profound the
impact of it I'm talking about in terms

6954
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:25,010
impact of it I'm talking about in terms
 

6955
02:15:25,010 --> 02:15:26,379
impact of it I'm talking about in terms
of tools in terms of things you can

6956
02:15:26,379 --> 02:15:26,389
of tools in terms of things you can
 

6957
02:15:26,389 --> 02:15:28,479
of tools in terms of things you can
download and yeah you can play with what

6958
02:15:28,479 --> 02:15:28,489
download and yeah you can play with what
 

6959
02:15:28,489 --> 02:15:30,370
download and yeah you can play with what
is it what what does it fit into the

6960
02:15:30,370 --> 02:15:30,380
is it what what does it fit into the
 

6961
02:15:30,380 --> 02:15:31,990
is it what what does it fit into the
infrastructure what are the different

6962
02:15:31,990 --> 02:15:32,000
infrastructure what are the different
 

6963
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:33,850
infrastructure what are the different
ways to interact with it right so I mean

6964
02:15:33,850 --> 02:15:33,860
ways to interact with it right so I mean
 

6965
02:15:33,860 --> 02:15:35,740
ways to interact with it right so I mean
that the two big things that people have

6966
02:15:35,740 --> 02:15:35,750
that the two big things that people have
 

6967
02:15:35,750 --> 02:15:38,080
that the two big things that people have
sort of perhaps heard of that come from

6968
02:15:38,080 --> 02:15:38,090
sort of perhaps heard of that come from
 

6969
02:15:38,090 --> 02:15:40,180
sort of perhaps heard of that come from
open language one is Mathematica the

6970
02:15:40,180 --> 02:15:40,190
open language one is Mathematica the
 

6971
02:15:40,190 --> 02:15:42,340
open language one is Mathematica the
other is Wolfram Alpha so Mathematica

6972
02:15:42,340 --> 02:15:42,350
other is Wolfram Alpha so Mathematica
 

6973
02:15:42,350 --> 02:15:45,490
other is Wolfram Alpha so Mathematica
first came out 1988 it's this system

6974
02:15:45,490 --> 02:15:45,500
first came out 1988 it's this system
 

6975
02:15:45,500 --> 02:15:49,720
first came out 1988 it's this system
that is basically a instance of Wolfram

6976
02:15:49,720 --> 02:15:49,730
that is basically a instance of Wolfram
 

6977
02:15:49,730 --> 02:15:52,000
that is basically a instance of Wolfram
language and it's used to do

6978
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:52,010
language and it's used to do
 

6979
02:15:52,010 --> 02:15:54,880
language and it's used to do
computations particularly in sort of

6980
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:54,890
computations particularly in sort of
 

6981
02:15:54,890 --> 02:15:58,330
computations particularly in sort of
technical areas and the typical thing

6982
02:15:58,330 --> 02:15:58,340
technical areas and the typical thing
 

6983
02:15:58,340 --> 02:15:59,950
technical areas and the typical thing
you're doing is you're you're typing

6984
02:15:59,950 --> 02:15:59,960
you're doing is you're you're typing
 

6985
02:15:59,960 --> 02:16:01,690
you're doing is you're you're typing
little pieces of computational language

6986
02:16:01,690 --> 02:16:01,700
little pieces of computational language
 

6987
02:16:01,700 --> 02:16:03,970
little pieces of computational language
and you're getting computations done

6988
02:16:03,970 --> 02:16:03,980
and you're getting computations done
 

6989
02:16:03,980 --> 02:16:06,910
and you're getting computations done
it's very kind of there's like as

6990
02:16:06,910 --> 02:16:06,920
it's very kind of there's like as
 

6991
02:16:06,920 --> 02:16:10,180
it's very kind of there's like as
symbolic yeah it's a symbolic language

6992
02:16:10,180 --> 02:16:10,190
symbolic yeah it's a symbolic language
 

6993
02:16:10,190 --> 02:16:12,550
symbolic yeah it's a symbolic language
so symbolic language took any I don't

6994
02:16:12,550 --> 02:16:12,560
so symbolic language took any I don't
 

6995
02:16:12,560 --> 02:16:14,080
so symbolic language took any I don't
know how to cleanly express that but

6996
02:16:14,080 --> 02:16:14,090
know how to cleanly express that but
 

6997
02:16:14,090 --> 02:16:16,000
know how to cleanly express that but
that makes a very distinct from what how

6998
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:16,010
that makes a very distinct from what how
 

6999
02:16:16,010 --> 02:16:19,000
that makes a very distinct from what how
we think about sort of I don't know

7000
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:19,010
we think about sort of I don't know
 

7001
02:16:19,010 --> 02:16:21,220
we think about sort of I don't know
programming in a Ling like Python or

7002
02:16:21,220 --> 02:16:21,230
programming in a Ling like Python or
 

7003
02:16:21,230 --> 02:16:22,870
programming in a Ling like Python or
something right but so so the point is

7004
02:16:22,870 --> 02:16:22,880
something right but so so the point is
 

7005
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:24,730
something right but so so the point is
that in a traditional programming

7006
02:16:24,730 --> 02:16:24,740
that in a traditional programming
 

7007
02:16:24,740 --> 02:16:26,590
that in a traditional programming
language the raw material of the

7008
02:16:26,590 --> 02:16:26,600
language the raw material of the
 

7009
02:16:26,600 --> 02:16:28,690
language the raw material of the
programming language it's just stuff

7010
02:16:28,690 --> 02:16:28,700
programming language it's just stuff
 

7011
02:16:28,700 --> 02:16:31,720
programming language it's just stuff
that computers intrinsically do and the

7012
02:16:31,720 --> 02:16:31,730
that computers intrinsically do and the
 

7013
02:16:31,730 --> 02:16:34,990
that computers intrinsically do and the
point of often language is that what the

7014
02:16:34,990 --> 02:16:35,000
point of often language is that what the
 

7015
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,420
point of often language is that what the
language is talking about is things that

7016
02:16:37,420 --> 02:16:37,430
language is talking about is things that
 

7017
02:16:37,430 --> 02:16:39,610
language is talking about is things that
exist in the world or things that we can

7018
02:16:39,610 --> 02:16:39,620
exist in the world or things that we can
 

7019
02:16:39,620 --> 02:16:42,910
exist in the world or things that we can
imagine and construct not it's not it's

7020
02:16:42,910 --> 02:16:42,920
imagine and construct not it's not it's
 

7021
02:16:42,920 --> 02:16:45,400
imagine and construct not it's not it's
not sort of it's it's aimed to be an

7022
02:16:45,400 --> 02:16:45,410
not sort of it's it's aimed to be an
 

7023
02:16:45,410 --> 02:16:47,500
not sort of it's it's aimed to be an
abstract language from the beginning and

7024
02:16:47,500 --> 02:16:47,510
abstract language from the beginning and
 

7025
02:16:47,510 --> 02:16:49,030
abstract language from the beginning and
so for example one feature it has is

7026
02:16:49,030 --> 02:16:49,040
so for example one feature it has is
 

7027
02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:50,950
so for example one feature it has is
that it's a symbolic language which

7028
02:16:50,950 --> 02:16:50,960
that it's a symbolic language which
 

7029
02:16:50,960 --> 02:16:52,930
that it's a symbolic language which
means that you know you the thing called

7030
02:16:52,930 --> 02:16:52,940
means that you know you the thing called
 

7031
02:16:52,940 --> 02:16:56,620
means that you know you the thing called
you have an X just type in X and what

7032
02:16:56,620 --> 02:16:56,630
you have an X just type in X and what
 

7033
02:16:56,630 --> 02:16:58,900
you have an X just type in X and what
why would you just say oh that's X it

7034
02:16:58,900 --> 02:16:58,910
why would you just say oh that's X it
 

7035
02:16:58,910 --> 02:17:01,330
why would you just say oh that's X it
won't say error undefined thing you know

7036
02:17:01,330 --> 02:17:01,340
won't say error undefined thing you know
 

7037
02:17:01,340 --> 02:17:02,860
won't say error undefined thing you know
I don't know what it is computation you

7038
02:17:02,860 --> 02:17:02,870
I don't know what it is computation you
 

7039
02:17:02,870 --> 02:17:05,260
I don't know what it is computation you
know but in terms of the in terms of

7040
02:17:05,260 --> 02:17:05,270
know but in terms of the in terms of
 

7041
02:17:05,270 --> 02:17:07,870
know but in terms of the in terms of
computer now that X could perfectly well

trajectory of some spacecraft

7050
02:17:17,410 --> 02:17:17,420
trajectory of some spacecraft
 

7051
02:17:17,420 --> 02:17:20,950
trajectory of some spacecraft
represented as a symbolic thing and that

7052
02:17:20,950 --> 02:17:20,960
represented as a symbolic thing and that
 

7053
02:17:20,960 --> 02:17:24,610
represented as a symbolic thing and that
idea that one can work with sort of

7054
02:17:24,610 --> 02:17:24,620
idea that one can work with sort of
 

7055
02:17:24,620 --> 02:17:25,930
idea that one can work with sort of

computationally work with these
 

7057
02:17:25,940 --> 02:17:28,060
computationally work with these
different these kinds of things that

02:17:30,530 --> 02:17:32,830
that exist in the world or describe the
world that's really powerful and that's

02:17:32,830 --> 02:17:32,840
world that's really powerful and that's
 

7063
02:17:32,840 --> 02:17:35,710
world that's really powerful and that's
what some I mean you know when I started

7064
02:17:35,710 --> 02:17:35,720
what some I mean you know when I started
 

7065
02:17:35,720 --> 02:17:37,630
what some I mean you know when I started
designing well I designed the

7066
02:17:37,630 --> 02:17:37,640
designing well I designed the
 

7067
02:17:37,640 --> 02:17:40,660
designing well I designed the
predecessor of what's now often language

7068
02:17:40,660 --> 02:17:40,670
predecessor of what's now often language
 

7069
02:17:40,670 --> 02:17:42,970
predecessor of what's now often language
was a thing called SMP which was my

7070
02:17:42,970 --> 02:17:42,980
was a thing called SMP which was my
 

7071
02:17:42,980 --> 02:17:46,570
was a thing called SMP which was my
first computer language I am I kind of

7072
02:17:46,570 --> 02:17:46,580
first computer language I am I kind of
 

7073
02:17:46,580 --> 02:17:48,540
first computer language I am I kind of
wanted to have this the sort of

7074
02:17:48,540 --> 02:17:48,550
wanted to have this the sort of
 

7075
02:17:48,550 --> 02:17:50,710
wanted to have this the sort of
infrastructure for computation which was

7076
02:17:50,710 --> 02:17:50,720
infrastructure for computation which was
 

7077
02:17:50,720 --> 02:17:52,480
infrastructure for computation which was
as fundamental as possible I mean this

7078
02:17:52,480 --> 02:17:52,490
as fundamental as possible I mean this
 

7079
02:17:52,490 --> 02:17:53,920
as fundamental as possible I mean this
is what I got for having bit of

7080
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:53,930
is what I got for having bit of
 

7081
02:17:53,930 --> 02:17:56,020
is what I got for having bit of
physicists and tried to find you know

7082
02:17:56,020 --> 02:17:56,030
physicists and tried to find you know
 

7083
02:17:56,030 --> 02:17:57,880
physicists and tried to find you know
fundamental components of things and

7084
02:17:57,880 --> 02:17:57,890
fundamental components of things and
 

7085
02:17:57,890 --> 02:18:01,110
fundamental components of things and
wound up with this kind of idea of

7086
02:18:01,110 --> 02:18:01,120
wound up with this kind of idea of
 

7087
02:18:01,120 --> 02:18:03,160
wound up with this kind of idea of
transformation rules for symbolic

7088
02:18:03,160 --> 02:18:03,170
transformation rules for symbolic
 

7089
02:18:03,170 --> 02:18:04,960
transformation rules for symbolic
expressions as being sort of the

7090
02:18:04,960 --> 02:18:04,970
expressions as being sort of the
 

7091
02:18:04,970 --> 02:18:05,800
expressions as being sort of the
underlying

7092
02:18:05,800 --> 02:18:05,810
underlying
 

7093
02:18:05,810 --> 02:18:08,650
underlying
stuff from which computation would be

7094
02:18:08,650 --> 02:18:08,660
stuff from which computation would be
 

7095
02:18:08,660 --> 02:18:10,900
stuff from which computation would be
built and that's what we've been

7096
02:18:10,900 --> 02:18:10,910
built and that's what we've been
 

7097
02:18:10,910 --> 02:18:13,480
built and that's what we've been
building from in Wolfram language and

7098
02:18:13,480 --> 02:18:13,490
building from in Wolfram language and
 

7099
02:18:13,490 --> 02:18:16,930
building from in Wolfram language and
you know operationally what happens it's

7100
02:18:16,930 --> 02:18:16,940
you know operationally what happens it's
 

7101
02:18:16,940 --> 02:18:19,661
you know operationally what happens it's
I would say by far the highest level

7102
02:18:19,661 --> 02:18:19,671
I would say by far the highest level
 

7103
02:18:19,671 --> 02:18:23,800
I would say by far the highest level
computer language that exists and its

7104
02:18:23,800 --> 02:18:23,810
computer language that exists and its
 

7105
02:18:23,810 --> 02:18:25,270
computer language that exists and its
really been built in a very different

7106
02:18:25,270 --> 02:18:25,280
really been built in a very different
 

7107
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:27,730
really been built in a very different
direction from other languages so other

7108
02:18:27,730 --> 02:18:27,740
direction from other languages so other
 

7109
02:18:27,740 --> 02:18:30,760
direction from other languages so other
languages have been about there is a lot

7110
02:18:30,760 --> 02:18:30,770
languages have been about there is a lot
 

7111
02:18:30,770 --> 02:18:31,720
languages have been about there is a lot
core language

7112
02:18:31,720 --> 02:18:31,730
core language
 

7113
02:18:31,730 --> 02:18:33,610
core language
it really is kind of wrapped around the

7114
02:18:33,610 --> 02:18:33,620
it really is kind of wrapped around the
 

7115
02:18:33,620 --> 02:18:35,320
it really is kind of wrapped around the
operations that a computer intrinsically

7116
02:18:35,320 --> 02:18:35,330
operations that a computer intrinsically
 

7117
02:18:35,330 --> 02:18:38,050
operations that a computer intrinsically
does maybe people add libraries for this

7118
02:18:38,050 --> 02:18:38,060
does maybe people add libraries for this
 

7119
02:18:38,060 --> 02:18:40,720
does maybe people add libraries for this
or that that but the goal of Wolfram

7120
02:18:40,720 --> 02:18:40,730
or that that but the goal of Wolfram
 

7121
02:18:40,730 --> 02:18:42,541
or that that but the goal of Wolfram
language is to have the language itself

7122
02:18:42,541 --> 02:18:42,551
language is to have the language itself
 

7123
02:18:42,551 --> 02:18:46,000
language is to have the language itself
be able to cover this sort of very broad

7124
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:46,010
be able to cover this sort of very broad
 

7125
02:18:46,010 --> 02:18:47,470
be able to cover this sort of very broad
range of things that show up in the

7126
02:18:47,470 --> 02:18:47,480
range of things that show up in the
 

7127
02:18:47,480 --> 02:18:49,541
range of things that show up in the
world and that means that you know there

7128
02:18:49,541 --> 02:18:49,551
world and that means that you know there
 

7129
02:18:49,551 --> 02:18:51,970
world and that means that you know there
are 6,000 primitive functions in the

7130
02:18:51,970 --> 02:18:51,980
are 6,000 primitive functions in the
 

7131
02:18:51,980 --> 02:18:54,400
are 6,000 primitive functions in the
Wolfram language that cover things you

7132
02:18:54,400 --> 02:18:54,410
Wolfram language that cover things you
 

7133
02:18:54,410 --> 02:18:56,500
Wolfram language that cover things you
know I could probably pick a a random

7134
02:18:56,500 --> 02:18:56,510
know I could probably pick a a random
 

7135
02:18:56,510 --> 02:18:59,291
know I could probably pick a a random
here I'm gonna pick just because just

7136
02:18:59,291 --> 02:18:59,301
here I'm gonna pick just because just
 

7137
02:18:59,301 --> 02:19:01,570
here I'm gonna pick just because just
for fun I'll pick them let's take a

7138
02:19:01,570 --> 02:19:01,580
for fun I'll pick them let's take a
 

7139
02:19:01,580 --> 02:19:05,951
for fun I'll pick them let's take a
random sample of them of all the things

7140
02:19:05,951 --> 02:19:05,961
random sample of them of all the things
 

7141
02:19:05,961 --> 02:19:08,350
random sample of them of all the things
that we have here so let's just say

7142
02:19:08,350 --> 02:19:08,360
that we have here so let's just say
 

7143
02:19:08,360 --> 02:19:10,121
that we have here so let's just say
random sample of 10 of them and let's

7144
02:19:10,121 --> 02:19:10,131
random sample of 10 of them and let's
 

7145
02:19:10,131 --> 02:19:13,390
random sample of 10 of them and let's
see what we get Wow okay so these are

7146
02:19:13,390 --> 02:19:13,400
see what we get Wow okay so these are
 

7147
02:19:13,400 --> 02:19:16,690
see what we get Wow okay so these are
really different things from functions

7148
02:19:16,690 --> 02:19:16,700
really different things from functions
 

7149
02:19:16,700 --> 02:19:19,060
really different things from functions
these are all functions boolean converts

7150
02:19:19,060 --> 02:19:19,070
these are all functions boolean converts
 

7151
02:19:19,070 --> 02:19:21,340
these are all functions boolean converts
okay that's the thing for converting

7152
02:19:21,340 --> 02:19:21,350
okay that's the thing for converting
 

7153
02:19:21,350 --> 02:19:23,920
okay that's the thing for converting
between different types of boolean

7154
02:19:23,920 --> 02:19:23,930
between different types of boolean
 

7155
02:19:23,930 --> 02:19:25,510
between different types of boolean
expressions so for people are just

7156
02:19:25,510 --> 02:19:25,520
expressions so for people are just
 

7157
02:19:25,520 --> 02:19:28,570
expressions so for people are just
listening human type 10 random sample

7158
02:19:28,570 --> 02:19:28,580
listening human type 10 random sample
 

7159
02:19:28,580 --> 02:19:31,331
listening human type 10 random sample
names sampling from all functionally how

7160
02:19:31,331 --> 02:19:31,341
names sampling from all functionally how
 

7161
02:19:31,341 --> 02:19:32,770
names sampling from all functionally how
many you said there might six thousand

7162
02:19:32,770 --> 02:19:32,780
many you said there might six thousand
 

7163
02:19:32,780 --> 02:19:34,510
many you said there might six thousand
six thousand six thousand ten of them

7164
02:19:34,510 --> 02:19:34,520
six thousand six thousand ten of them
 

7165
02:19:34,520 --> 02:19:37,510
six thousand six thousand ten of them
and there's a hilarious variety of them

7166
02:19:37,510 --> 02:19:37,520
and there's a hilarious variety of them
 

7167
02:19:37,520 --> 02:19:39,491
and there's a hilarious variety of them
yeah right well we've got things about

7168
02:19:39,491 --> 02:19:39,501
yeah right well we've got things about
 

7169
02:19:39,501 --> 02:19:42,010
yeah right well we've got things about
some dollar requests or a dress that has

7170
02:19:42,010 --> 02:19:42,020
some dollar requests or a dress that has
 

7171
02:19:42,020 --> 02:19:45,371
some dollar requests or a dress that has
to do with interacting with the the

7172
02:19:45,371 --> 02:19:45,381
to do with interacting with the the
 

7173
02:19:45,381 --> 02:19:47,470
to do with interacting with the the
world of the of the cloud and so on

7174
02:19:47,470 --> 02:19:47,480
world of the of the cloud and so on
 

7175
02:19:47,480 --> 02:19:50,320
world of the of the cloud and so on
discrete wavelet data it's for ROI a

7176
02:19:50,320 --> 02:19:50,330
discrete wavelet data it's for ROI a
 

7177
02:19:50,330 --> 02:19:52,751
discrete wavelet data it's for ROI a
graphical sort of window yeah yeah

7178
02:19:52,751 --> 02:19:52,761
graphical sort of window yeah yeah
 

7179
02:19:52,761 --> 02:19:54,161
graphical sort of window yeah yeah
window moveable that's the user

7180
02:19:54,161 --> 02:19:54,171
window moveable that's the user
 

7181
02:19:54,171 --> 02:19:55,930
window moveable that's the user
interface kind of thing I want to pick

7182
02:19:55,930 --> 02:19:55,940
interface kind of thing I want to pick
 

7183
02:19:55,940 --> 02:19:58,360
interface kind of thing I want to pick
another 10 cuz I think this is some okay

7184
02:19:58,360 --> 02:19:58,370
another 10 cuz I think this is some okay
 

7185
02:19:58,370 --> 02:20:00,400
another 10 cuz I think this is some okay
so yeah there's a lot of infrastructure

7186
02:20:00,400 --> 02:20:00,410
so yeah there's a lot of infrastructure
 

7187
02:20:00,410 --> 02:20:02,081
so yeah there's a lot of infrastructure
stuff here that you see if you if you

7188
02:20:02,081 --> 02:20:02,091
stuff here that you see if you if you
 

7189
02:20:02,091 --> 02:20:03,761
stuff here that you see if you if you
just start sampling at random there's a

7190
02:20:03,761 --> 02:20:03,771
just start sampling at random there's a
 

7191
02:20:03,771 --> 02:20:05,381
just start sampling at random there's a
lot of kind of infrastructural things if

7192
02:20:05,381 --> 02:20:05,391
lot of kind of infrastructural things if
 

7193
02:20:05,391 --> 02:20:07,150
lot of kind of infrastructural things if
you're more you know if you more look at

7194
02:20:07,150 --> 02:20:07,160
you're more you know if you more look at
 

7195
02:20:07,160 --> 02:20:08,560
you're more you know if you more look at
the some of the exciting machine

7196
02:20:08,560 --> 02:20:08,570
the some of the exciting machine
 

7197
02:20:08,570 --> 02:20:10,451
the some of the exciting machine
learning stuff is shut off is that also

7198
02:20:10,451 --> 02:20:10,461
learning stuff is shut off is that also
 

7199
02:20:10,461 --> 02:20:12,881
learning stuff is shut off is that also
in this pool oh yeah yeah I mean you

7200
02:20:12,881 --> 02:20:12,891
in this pool oh yeah yeah I mean you
 

7201
02:20:12,891 --> 02:20:14,860
in this pool oh yeah yeah I mean you
know so one of those functions is like

7202
02:20:14,860 --> 02:20:14,870
know so one of those functions is like
 

7203
02:20:14,870 --> 02:20:17,860
know so one of those functions is like
image identify as a function here where

7204
02:20:17,860 --> 02:20:17,870
image identify as a function here where
 

7205
02:20:17,870 --> 02:20:19,390
image identify as a function here where
you just say image identified

7206
02:20:19,390 --> 02:20:19,400
you just say image identified
 

7207
02:20:19,400 --> 02:20:21,790
you just say image identified
was good too let's do this let's say

7208
02:20:21,790 --> 02:20:21,800
was good too let's do this let's say
 

7209
02:20:21,800 --> 02:20:24,870
was good too let's do this let's say
current image and let's pick up an image

7210
02:20:24,870 --> 02:20:24,880
current image and let's pick up an image
 

7211
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:28,540
current image and let's pick up an image
hopefully just a current image accessing

7212
02:20:28,540 --> 02:20:28,550
hopefully just a current image accessing
 

7213
02:20:28,550 --> 02:20:32,761
hopefully just a current image accessing
the webcam took a picture yourself

7214
02:20:32,761 --> 02:20:32,771
the webcam took a picture yourself
 

7215
02:20:32,771 --> 02:20:36,040
the webcam took a picture yourself
anyway we can say image identify open

7216
02:20:36,040 --> 02:20:36,050
anyway we can say image identify open
 

7217
02:20:36,050 --> 02:20:38,080
anyway we can say image identify open
square brackets and then we just paste

7218
02:20:38,080 --> 02:20:38,090
square brackets and then we just paste
 

7219
02:20:38,090 --> 02:20:40,390
square brackets and then we just paste
that picture in there imagine if I

7220
02:20:40,390 --> 02:20:40,400
that picture in there imagine if I
 

7221
02:20:40,400 --> 02:20:42,250
that picture in there imagine if I
function running come to picture lo and

7222
02:20:42,250 --> 02:20:42,260
function running come to picture lo and
 

7223
02:20:42,260 --> 02:20:44,560
function running come to picture lo and
it says oh wow it says I look I look

7224
02:20:44,560 --> 02:20:44,570
it says oh wow it says I look I look
 

7225
02:20:44,570 --> 02:20:46,270
it says oh wow it says I look I look
like a plunger because I got this great

7226
02:20:46,270 --> 02:20:46,280
like a plunger because I got this great
 

7227
02:20:46,280 --> 02:20:48,190
like a plunger because I got this great
big thing behind me classify so this

7228
02:20:48,190 --> 02:20:48,200
big thing behind me classify so this
 

7229
02:20:48,200 --> 02:20:49,810
big thing behind me classify so this
image identify classifies the most

7230
02:20:49,810 --> 02:20:49,820
image identify classifies the most
 

7231
02:20:49,820 --> 02:20:52,750
image identify classifies the most
likely object in in the image in it so

7232
02:20:52,750 --> 02:20:52,760
likely object in in the image in it so
 

7233
02:20:52,760 --> 02:20:55,000
likely object in in the image in it so
there's a wonder okay that's that that's

7234
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:55,010
there's a wonder okay that's that that's
 

7235
02:20:55,010 --> 02:20:56,290
there's a wonder okay that's that that's
a bit embarrassing let's see what it

7236
02:20:56,290 --> 02:20:56,300
a bit embarrassing let's see what it
 

7237
02:20:56,300 --> 02:21:00,460
a bit embarrassing let's see what it
does let's pick the top 10 um okay well

7238
02:21:00,460 --> 02:21:00,470
does let's pick the top 10 um okay well
 

7239
02:21:00,470 --> 02:21:01,960
does let's pick the top 10 um okay well
it thinks there's oh it thinks it's

7240
02:21:01,960 --> 02:21:01,970
it thinks there's oh it thinks it's
 

7241
02:21:01,970 --> 02:21:03,940
it thinks there's oh it thinks it's
pretty unlikely that it's a primary two

7242
02:21:03,940 --> 02:21:03,950
pretty unlikely that it's a primary two
 

7243
02:21:03,950 --> 02:21:05,500
pretty unlikely that it's a primary two
hominid two plus eight percent

7244
02:21:05,500 --> 02:21:05,510
hominid two plus eight percent
 

7245
02:21:05,510 --> 02:21:07,511
hominid two plus eight percent
probability yeah that's that's five

7246
02:21:07,511 --> 02:21:07,521
probability yeah that's that's five
 

7247
02:21:07,521 --> 02:21:10,270
probability yeah that's that's five
seven it's a plunger yeah well so if we

7248
02:21:10,270 --> 02:21:10,280
seven it's a plunger yeah well so if we
 

7249
02:21:10,280 --> 02:21:12,040
seven it's a plunger yeah well so if we
will not give you an existential crisis

7250
02:21:12,040 --> 02:21:12,050
will not give you an existential crisis
 

7251
02:21:12,050 --> 02:21:15,490
will not give you an existential crisis
and then uh eight percent or not I

7252
02:21:15,490 --> 02:21:15,500
and then uh eight percent or not I
 

7253
02:21:15,500 --> 02:21:18,310
and then uh eight percent or not I
should say percent but no that's a scent

7254
02:21:18,310 --> 02:21:18,320
should say percent but no that's a scent
 

7255
02:21:18,320 --> 02:21:21,430
should say percent but no that's a scent
that it's a hominid um and yeah okay

7256
02:21:21,430 --> 02:21:21,440
that it's a hominid um and yeah okay
 

7257
02:21:21,440 --> 02:21:22,870
that it's a hominid um and yeah okay
it's really I'm gonna do another one of

7258
02:21:22,870 --> 02:21:22,880
it's really I'm gonna do another one of
 

7259
02:21:22,880 --> 02:21:24,730
it's really I'm gonna do another one of
these just because I'm embarrassed that

7260
02:21:24,730 --> 02:21:24,740
these just because I'm embarrassed that
 

7261
02:21:24,740 --> 02:21:29,620
these just because I'm embarrassed that
it there we go let's try that let's see

7262
02:21:29,620 --> 02:21:29,630
it there we go let's try that let's see
 

7263
02:21:29,630 --> 02:21:33,030
it there we go let's try that let's see
what that did um we took a picture a

7264
02:21:33,030 --> 02:21:33,040
what that did um we took a picture a
 

7265
02:21:33,040 --> 02:21:35,801
what that did um we took a picture a
little bit a little bit more of me and

7266
02:21:35,801 --> 02:21:35,811
little bit a little bit more of me and
 

7267
02:21:35,811 --> 02:21:38,801
little bit a little bit more of me and
not just my bald head so to speak okay

7268
02:21:38,801 --> 02:21:38,811
not just my bald head so to speak okay
 

7269
02:21:38,811 --> 02:21:40,690
not just my bald head so to speak okay
eighty-nine percent problem is it's a

7270
02:21:40,690 --> 02:21:40,700
eighty-nine percent problem is it's a
 

7271
02:21:40,700 --> 02:21:42,640
eighty-nine percent problem is it's a
person so that there so then I would um

7272
02:21:42,640 --> 02:21:42,650
person so that there so then I would um
 

7273
02:21:42,650 --> 02:21:45,160
person so that there so then I would um
but you know so this is image identify

7274
02:21:45,160 --> 02:21:45,170
but you know so this is image identify
 

7275
02:21:45,170 --> 02:21:47,350
but you know so this is image identify
as an example of one of just one of them

7276
02:21:47,350 --> 02:21:47,360
as an example of one of just one of them
 

7277
02:21:47,360 --> 02:21:49,420
as an example of one of just one of them
in just one function and that's part of

7278
02:21:49,420 --> 02:21:49,430
in just one function and that's part of
 

7279
02:21:49,430 --> 02:21:52,540
in just one function and that's part of
the that's like part of the language yes

7280
02:21:52,540 --> 02:21:52,550
the that's like part of the language yes
 

7281
02:21:52,550 --> 02:21:54,220
the that's like part of the language yes
so first I mean you know something like

7282
02:21:54,220 --> 02:21:54,230
so first I mean you know something like
 

7283
02:21:54,230 --> 02:21:56,860
so first I mean you know something like
um I could say I don't know let's find

7284
02:21:56,860 --> 02:21:56,870
um I could say I don't know let's find
 

7285
02:21:56,870 --> 02:22:00,790
um I could say I don't know let's find
the geo nearest what could we find let's

7286
02:22:00,790 --> 02:22:00,800
the geo nearest what could we find let's
 

7287
02:22:00,800 --> 02:22:04,810
the geo nearest what could we find let's
find the nearest volcano um let's find

7288
02:22:04,810 --> 02:22:04,820
find the nearest volcano um let's find
 

7289
02:22:04,820 --> 02:22:09,040
find the nearest volcano um let's find
the ten I wonder where it thinks here is

7290
02:22:09,040 --> 02:22:09,050
the ten I wonder where it thinks here is
 

7291
02:22:09,050 --> 02:22:11,860
the ten I wonder where it thinks here is
let's try finding the ten volcanoes

7292
02:22:11,860 --> 02:22:11,870
let's try finding the ten volcanoes
 

7293
02:22:11,870 --> 02:22:15,850
let's try finding the ten volcanoes
nearest here okay yo nearest volcano

7294
02:22:15,850 --> 02:22:15,860
nearest here okay yo nearest volcano
 

7295
02:22:15,860 --> 02:22:19,120
nearest here okay yo nearest volcano
here 10 years volcanoes right let's find

7296
02:22:19,120 --> 02:22:19,130
here 10 years volcanoes right let's find
 

7297
02:22:19,130 --> 02:22:20,500
here 10 years volcanoes right let's find
out where those oh we can now we got a

7298
02:22:20,500 --> 02:22:20,510
out where those oh we can now we got a
 

7299
02:22:20,510 --> 02:22:22,660
out where those oh we can now we got a
list of volcanoes out and I can say geo

7300
02:22:22,660 --> 02:22:22,670
list of volcanoes out and I can say geo
 

7301
02:22:22,670 --> 02:22:26,140
list of volcanoes out and I can say geo
list plot that and hopefully okay so

7302
02:22:26,140 --> 02:22:26,150
list plot that and hopefully okay so
 

7303
02:22:26,150 --> 02:22:28,750
list plot that and hopefully okay so
there we go so there's a map that shows

7304
02:22:28,750 --> 02:22:28,760
there we go so there's a map that shows
 

7305
02:22:28,760 --> 02:22:30,761
there we go so there's a map that shows
the positions of those ten volcanoes of

7306
02:22:30,761 --> 02:22:30,771
the positions of those ten volcanoes of
 

7307
02:22:30,771 --> 02:22:32,610
the positions of those ten volcanoes of
the East Coast and the Midway

7308
02:22:32,610 --> 02:22:32,620
the East Coast and the Midway
 

7309
02:22:32,620 --> 02:22:35,040
the East Coast and the Midway
density well no we're okay okay there's

7310
02:22:35,040 --> 02:22:35,050
density well no we're okay okay there's
 

7311
02:22:35,050 --> 02:22:36,511
density well no we're okay okay there's
not it's not too bad yeah they're not

7312
02:22:36,511 --> 02:22:36,521
not it's not too bad yeah they're not
 

7313
02:22:36,521 --> 02:22:37,710
not it's not too bad yeah they're not
very close to us we could we could

7314
02:22:37,710 --> 02:22:37,720
very close to us we could we could
 

7315
02:22:37,720 --> 02:22:40,080
very close to us we could we could
measure how far away they are but you

7316
02:22:40,080 --> 02:22:40,090
measure how far away they are but you
 

7317
02:22:40,090 --> 02:22:42,540
measure how far away they are but you
know the fact that right in the language

7318
02:22:42,540 --> 02:22:42,550
know the fact that right in the language
 

7319
02:22:42,550 --> 02:22:44,790
know the fact that right in the language
it knows about all the volcanoes in the

7320
02:22:44,790 --> 02:22:44,800
it knows about all the volcanoes in the
 

7321
02:22:44,800 --> 02:22:47,280
it knows about all the volcanoes in the
world that knows you know computing what

7322
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:47,290
world that knows you know computing what
 

7323
02:22:47,290 --> 02:22:48,750
world that knows you know computing what
the nearest ones are it knows all the

7324
02:22:48,750 --> 02:22:48,760
the nearest ones are it knows all the
 

7325
02:22:48,760 --> 02:22:50,040
the nearest ones are it knows all the
maps of the world and so on a

7326
02:22:50,040 --> 02:22:50,050
maps of the world and so on a
 

7327
02:22:50,050 --> 02:22:51,360
maps of the world and so on a
fundamentally different idea what a

7328
02:22:51,360 --> 02:22:51,370
fundamentally different idea what a
 

7329
02:22:51,370 --> 02:22:53,730
fundamentally different idea what a
language is yeah right that's that's

7330
02:22:53,730 --> 02:22:53,740
language is yeah right that's that's
 

7331
02:22:53,740 --> 02:22:55,290
language is yeah right that's that's
what I like to talk about is you know a

7332
02:22:55,290 --> 02:22:55,300
what I like to talk about is you know a
 

7333
02:22:55,300 --> 02:22:57,120
what I like to talk about is you know a
full scale computational language that's

7334
02:22:57,120 --> 02:22:57,130
full scale computational language that's
 

7335
02:22:57,130 --> 02:22:58,620
full scale computational language that's
that's what we've tried to do and just

7336
02:22:58,620 --> 02:22:58,630
that's what we've tried to do and just
 

7337
02:22:58,630 --> 02:23:00,930
that's what we've tried to do and just
if you can comment briefly I mean this

7338
02:23:00,930 --> 02:23:00,940
if you can comment briefly I mean this
 

7339
02:23:00,940 --> 02:23:04,200
if you can comment briefly I mean this
kind of the Wolfram language along with

7340
02:23:04,200 --> 02:23:04,210
kind of the Wolfram language along with
 

7341
02:23:04,210 --> 02:23:05,940
kind of the Wolfram language along with
Wolfram Alpha represents kind of what

7342
02:23:05,940 --> 02:23:05,950
Wolfram Alpha represents kind of what
 

7343
02:23:05,950 --> 02:23:08,070
Wolfram Alpha represents kind of what
the dream of what AI is supposed to be

7344
02:23:08,070 --> 02:23:08,080
the dream of what AI is supposed to be
 

7345
02:23:08,080 --> 02:23:10,440
the dream of what AI is supposed to be
there's now a sort of a craze of

7346
02:23:10,440 --> 02:23:10,450
there's now a sort of a craze of
 

7347
02:23:10,450 --> 02:23:13,320
there's now a sort of a craze of
learning kind of idea that we can take

7348
02:23:13,320 --> 02:23:13,330
learning kind of idea that we can take
 

7349
02:23:13,330 --> 02:23:16,820
learning kind of idea that we can take
raw data and from that extract the the

7350
02:23:16,820 --> 02:23:16,830
raw data and from that extract the the
 

7351
02:23:16,830 --> 02:23:19,140
raw data and from that extract the the
different hierarchies of abstractions

7352
02:23:19,140 --> 02:23:19,150
different hierarchies of abstractions
 

7353
02:23:19,150 --> 02:23:22,380
different hierarchies of abstractions
and in order to be able to under the

7354
02:23:22,380 --> 02:23:22,390
and in order to be able to under the
 

7355
02:23:22,390 --> 02:23:25,761
and in order to be able to under the
kind of things that well from language

7356
02:23:25,761 --> 02:23:25,771
kind of things that well from language
 

7357
02:23:25,771 --> 02:23:29,130
kind of things that well from language
operates with but we're very far from

7358
02:23:29,130 --> 02:23:29,140
operates with but we're very far from
 

7359
02:23:29,140 --> 02:23:30,860
operates with but we're very far from
learning systems being able to form that

7360
02:23:30,860 --> 02:23:30,870
learning systems being able to form that
 

7361
02:23:30,870 --> 02:23:35,370
learning systems being able to form that
but like the context of history of AI if

7362
02:23:35,370 --> 02:23:35,380
but like the context of history of AI if
 

7363
02:23:35,380 --> 02:23:38,250
but like the context of history of AI if
you could just comment on there is a you

7364
02:23:38,250 --> 02:23:38,260
you could just comment on there is a you
 

7365
02:23:38,260 --> 02:23:40,950
you could just comment on there is a you
said computation X and there's just some

7366
02:23:40,950 --> 02:23:40,960
said computation X and there's just some
 

7367
02:23:40,960 --> 02:23:43,500
said computation X and there's just some
sense where in the 80's and 90's sort of

7368
02:23:43,500 --> 02:23:43,510
sense where in the 80's and 90's sort of
 

7369
02:23:43,510 --> 02:23:45,450
sense where in the 80's and 90's sort of
expert systems represented a very

7370
02:23:45,450 --> 02:23:45,460
expert systems represented a very
 

7371
02:23:45,460 --> 02:23:48,030
expert systems represented a very
particular computation ax yes right and

7372
02:23:48,030 --> 02:23:48,040
particular computation ax yes right and
 

7373
02:23:48,040 --> 02:23:50,610
particular computation ax yes right and
there's a kind of notion that those

7374
02:23:50,610 --> 02:23:50,620
there's a kind of notion that those
 

7375
02:23:50,620 --> 02:23:53,820
there's a kind of notion that those
efforts didn't pan out right but then

7376
02:23:53,820 --> 02:23:53,830
efforts didn't pan out right but then
 

7377
02:23:53,830 --> 02:23:57,210
efforts didn't pan out right but then
out of that emerges kind of Wolfram

7378
02:23:57,210 --> 02:23:57,220
out of that emerges kind of Wolfram
 

7379
02:23:57,220 --> 02:23:59,310
out of that emerges kind of Wolfram
language Wolfram Alpha which is the

7380
02:23:59,310 --> 02:23:59,320
language Wolfram Alpha which is the
 

7381
02:23:59,320 --> 02:24:01,410
language Wolfram Alpha which is the
success I mean yeah right I think those

7382
02:24:01,410 --> 02:24:01,420
success I mean yeah right I think those
 

7383
02:24:01,420 --> 02:24:03,120
success I mean yeah right I think those
are in some sense those efforts were too

7384
02:24:03,120 --> 02:24:03,130
are in some sense those efforts were too
 

7385
02:24:03,130 --> 02:24:05,250
are in some sense those efforts were too
modest they're nice they were they were

7386
02:24:05,250 --> 02:24:05,260
modest they're nice they were they were
 

7387
02:24:05,260 --> 02:24:07,830
modest they're nice they were they were
looking at particular areas and you

7388
02:24:07,830 --> 02:24:07,840
looking at particular areas and you
 

7389
02:24:07,840 --> 02:24:09,091
looking at particular areas and you
actually can't do it with a particular

7390
02:24:09,091 --> 02:24:09,101
actually can't do it with a particular
 

7391
02:24:09,101 --> 02:24:11,070
actually can't do it with a particular
area I mean like like even a problem

7392
02:24:11,070 --> 02:24:11,080
area I mean like like even a problem
 

7393
02:24:11,080 --> 02:24:13,020
area I mean like like even a problem
like natural language understanding it's

7394
02:24:13,020 --> 02:24:13,030
like natural language understanding it's
 

7395
02:24:13,030 --> 02:24:14,820
like natural language understanding it's
critical to have broad knowledge of the

7396
02:24:14,820 --> 02:24:14,830
critical to have broad knowledge of the
 

7397
02:24:14,830 --> 02:24:16,470
critical to have broad knowledge of the
world if you want to do good natural

7398
02:24:16,470 --> 02:24:16,480
world if you want to do good natural
 

7399
02:24:16,480 --> 02:24:18,301
world if you want to do good natural
language understanding and you kind of

7400
02:24:18,301 --> 02:24:18,311
language understanding and you kind of
 

7401
02:24:18,311 --> 02:24:20,370
language understanding and you kind of
have to bite off the whole problem if

7402
02:24:20,370 --> 02:24:20,380
have to bite off the whole problem if
 

7403
02:24:20,380 --> 02:24:21,960
have to bite off the whole problem if
you if you say we're just gonna do the

7404
02:24:21,960 --> 02:24:21,970
you if you say we're just gonna do the
 

7405
02:24:21,970 --> 02:24:24,060
you if you say we're just gonna do the
blocks world over here so to speak

7406
02:24:24,060 --> 02:24:24,070
blocks world over here so to speak
 

7407
02:24:24,070 --> 02:24:26,610
blocks world over here so to speak
you don't really it's it's it's actually

7408
02:24:26,610 --> 02:24:26,620
you don't really it's it's it's actually
 

7409
02:24:26,620 --> 02:24:28,051
you don't really it's it's it's actually
it's one of these cases where it's

7410
02:24:28,051 --> 02:24:28,061
it's one of these cases where it's
 

7411
02:24:28,061 --> 02:24:29,730
it's one of these cases where it's
easier to do the whole thing than it is

7412
02:24:29,730 --> 02:24:29,740
easier to do the whole thing than it is
 

7413
02:24:29,740 --> 02:24:31,350
easier to do the whole thing than it is
to do some piece of it you know what one

7414
02:24:31,350 --> 02:24:31,360
to do some piece of it you know what one
 

7415
02:24:31,360 --> 02:24:32,670
to do some piece of it you know what one
comment to make about so the

7416
02:24:32,670 --> 02:24:32,680
comment to make about so the
 

7417
02:24:32,680 --> 02:24:34,801
comment to make about so the
relationship between what we've tried to

7418
02:24:34,801 --> 02:24:34,811
relationship between what we've tried to
 

7419
02:24:34,811 --> 02:24:38,030
relationship between what we've tried to
do and sort of the learning side of AI

7420
02:24:38,030 --> 02:24:38,040
do and sort of the learning side of AI
 

7421
02:24:38,040 --> 02:24:40,261
do and sort of the learning side of AI
you know in a sense if you look at the

7422
02:24:40,261 --> 02:24:40,271
you know in a sense if you look at the
 

7423
02:24:40,271 --> 02:24:41,640
you know in a sense if you look at the
development of knowledge in our

7424
02:24:41,640 --> 02:24:41,650
development of knowledge in our
 

7425
02:24:41,650 --> 02:24:43,770
development of knowledge in our
civilization as a whole there was kind

7426
02:24:43,770 --> 02:24:43,780
civilization as a whole there was kind
 

7427
02:24:43,780 --> 02:24:45,370
civilization as a whole there was kind
of this notion for

7428
02:24:45,370 --> 02:24:45,380
of this notion for
 

7429
02:24:45,380 --> 02:24:47,260
of this notion for
three hundred years ago or so now you

7430
02:24:47,260 --> 02:24:47,270
three hundred years ago or so now you
 

7431
02:24:47,270 --> 02:24:48,490
three hundred years ago or so now you
want to figure something out about the

7432
02:24:48,490 --> 02:24:48,500
want to figure something out about the
 

7433
02:24:48,500 --> 02:24:50,530
want to figure something out about the
world you can reason it out you can do

7434
02:24:50,530 --> 02:24:50,540
world you can reason it out you can do
 

7435
02:24:50,540 --> 02:24:52,780
world you can reason it out you can do
things which would just use raw human

7436
02:24:52,780 --> 02:24:52,790
things which would just use raw human
 

7437
02:24:52,790 --> 02:24:55,270
things which would just use raw human
thought and then along came sort of

7438
02:24:55,270 --> 02:24:55,280
thought and then along came sort of
 

7439
02:24:55,280 --> 02:24:58,570
thought and then along came sort of
modern mathematical science and we found

7440
02:24:58,570 --> 02:24:58,580
modern mathematical science and we found
 

7441
02:24:58,580 --> 02:25:00,850
modern mathematical science and we found
ways to just sort of blast through that

7442
02:25:00,850 --> 02:25:00,860
ways to just sort of blast through that
 

7443
02:25:00,860 --> 02:25:02,700
ways to just sort of blast through that
by in that case writing down equations

7444
02:25:02,700 --> 02:25:02,710
by in that case writing down equations
 

7445
02:25:02,710 --> 02:25:04,960
by in that case writing down equations
now we also know we can do that with

7446
02:25:04,960 --> 02:25:04,970
now we also know we can do that with
 

7447
02:25:04,970 --> 02:25:07,870
now we also know we can do that with
computation and so on um and so that was

7448
02:25:07,870 --> 02:25:07,880
computation and so on um and so that was
 

7449
02:25:07,880 --> 02:25:09,400
computation and so on um and so that was
kind of a different thing so when we

7450
02:25:09,400 --> 02:25:09,410
kind of a different thing so when we
 

7451
02:25:09,410 --> 02:25:12,460
kind of a different thing so when we
look at how do we sort of encode

7452
02:25:12,460 --> 02:25:12,470
look at how do we sort of encode
 

7453
02:25:12,470 --> 02:25:14,830
look at how do we sort of encode
knowledge and figure things out one way

7454
02:25:14,830 --> 02:25:14,840
knowledge and figure things out one way
 

7455
02:25:14,840 --> 02:25:16,300
knowledge and figure things out one way
we could do it is start from scratch

7456
02:25:16,300 --> 02:25:16,310
we could do it is start from scratch
 

7457
02:25:16,310 --> 02:25:18,790
we could do it is start from scratch
learn everything it's just a neuron that

7458
02:25:18,790 --> 02:25:18,800
learn everything it's just a neuron that
 

7459
02:25:18,800 --> 02:25:21,310
learn everything it's just a neuron that
figuring everything out but in a sense

7460
02:25:21,310 --> 02:25:21,320
figuring everything out but in a sense
 

7461
02:25:21,320 --> 02:25:24,250
figuring everything out but in a sense
that denies the sort of knowledge-based

7462
02:25:24,250 --> 02:25:24,260
that denies the sort of knowledge-based
 

7463
02:25:24,260 --> 02:25:26,620
that denies the sort of knowledge-based
achievements of our civilization because

7464
02:25:26,620 --> 02:25:26,630
achievements of our civilization because
 

7465
02:25:26,630 --> 02:25:29,050
achievements of our civilization because
in our civilization we have learnt lots

7466
02:25:29,050 --> 02:25:29,060
in our civilization we have learnt lots
 

7467
02:25:29,060 --> 02:25:30,280
in our civilization we have learnt lots
of stuff we've surveyed all the

7468
02:25:30,280 --> 02:25:30,290
of stuff we've surveyed all the
 

7469
02:25:30,290 --> 02:25:31,990
of stuff we've surveyed all the
volcanoes in the world we've done you

7470
02:25:31,990 --> 02:25:32,000
volcanoes in the world we've done you
 

7471
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:33,490
volcanoes in the world we've done you
know we've figured out lots of

7472
02:25:33,490 --> 02:25:33,500
know we've figured out lots of
 

7473
02:25:33,500 --> 02:25:35,980
know we've figured out lots of
algorithms for this or that those are

7474
02:25:35,980 --> 02:25:35,990
algorithms for this or that those are
 

7475
02:25:35,990 --> 02:25:37,230
algorithms for this or that those are
things that we can encode

7476
02:25:37,230 --> 02:25:37,240
things that we can encode
 

7477
02:25:37,240 --> 02:25:39,400
things that we can encode
computationally and that's what we've

7478
02:25:39,400 --> 02:25:39,410
computationally and that's what we've
 

7479
02:25:39,410 --> 02:25:41,679
computationally and that's what we've
tried to do and we're not saying just

7480
02:25:41,679 --> 02:25:41,689
tried to do and we're not saying just
 

7481
02:25:41,689 --> 02:25:43,600
tried to do and we're not saying just
you don't have to start everything from

7482
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:43,610
you don't have to start everything from
 

7483
02:25:43,610 --> 02:25:45,910
you don't have to start everything from
scratch so in a sense a big part of what

7484
02:25:45,910 --> 02:25:45,920
scratch so in a sense a big part of what
 

7485
02:25:45,920 --> 02:25:49,060
scratch so in a sense a big part of what
we've done is to try and sort of capture

7486
02:25:49,060 --> 02:25:49,070
we've done is to try and sort of capture
 

7487
02:25:49,070 --> 02:25:50,740
we've done is to try and sort of capture
the knowledge of the world in

7488
02:25:50,740 --> 02:25:50,750
the knowledge of the world in
 

7489
02:25:50,750 --> 02:25:52,810
the knowledge of the world in
computational form in computable form

7490
02:25:52,810 --> 02:25:52,820
computational form in computable form
 

7491
02:25:52,820 --> 02:25:56,860
computational form in computable form
now there's also some pieces which which

7492
02:25:56,860 --> 02:25:56,870
now there's also some pieces which which
 

7493
02:25:56,870 --> 02:25:58,060
now there's also some pieces which which
were for a long time

7494
02:25:58,060 --> 02:25:58,070
were for a long time
 

7495
02:25:58,070 --> 02:25:59,740
were for a long time
undoable by computers like image

7496
02:25:59,740 --> 02:25:59,750
undoable by computers like image
 

7497
02:25:59,750 --> 02:26:02,200
undoable by computers like image
identification where there's a really

7498
02:26:02,200 --> 02:26:02,210
identification where there's a really
 

7499
02:26:02,210 --> 02:26:04,600
identification where there's a really
really useful module that we can add

7500
02:26:04,600 --> 02:26:04,610
really useful module that we can add
 

7501
02:26:04,610 --> 02:26:07,060
really useful module that we can add
that is those things which actually were

7502
02:26:07,060 --> 02:26:07,070
that is those things which actually were
 

7503
02:26:07,070 --> 02:26:09,370
that is those things which actually were
pretty easy for humans to do that had

7504
02:26:09,370 --> 02:26:09,380
pretty easy for humans to do that had
 

7505
02:26:09,380 --> 02:26:11,050
pretty easy for humans to do that had
been hard for computers to do I think

7506
02:26:11,050 --> 02:26:11,060
been hard for computers to do I think
 

7507
02:26:11,060 --> 02:26:12,310
been hard for computers to do I think
the thing that's interesting that's

7508
02:26:12,310 --> 02:26:12,320
the thing that's interesting that's
 

7509
02:26:12,320 --> 02:26:14,170
the thing that's interesting that's
emerging now is the interplay between

7510
02:26:14,170 --> 02:26:14,180
emerging now is the interplay between
 

7511
02:26:14,180 --> 02:26:15,700
emerging now is the interplay between
these things between this kind of

7512
02:26:15,700 --> 02:26:15,710
these things between this kind of
 

7513
02:26:15,710 --> 02:26:17,620
these things between this kind of
knowledge of the world that is in a

7514
02:26:17,620 --> 02:26:17,630
knowledge of the world that is in a
 

7515
02:26:17,630 --> 02:26:19,929
knowledge of the world that is in a
sense very symbolic and this kind of

7516
02:26:19,929 --> 02:26:19,939
sense very symbolic and this kind of
 

7517
02:26:19,939 --> 02:26:23,880
sense very symbolic and this kind of
sort of much more statistical kind of

7518
02:26:23,880 --> 02:26:23,890
sort of much more statistical kind of
 

7519
02:26:23,890 --> 02:26:26,830
sort of much more statistical kind of
things like image identification and so

7520
02:26:26,830 --> 02:26:26,840
things like image identification and so
 

7521
02:26:26,840 --> 02:26:29,500
things like image identification and so
on and putting those together by having

7522
02:26:29,500 --> 02:26:29,510
on and putting those together by having
 

7523
02:26:29,510 --> 02:26:31,420
on and putting those together by having
the sort of symbolic representation of

7524
02:26:31,420 --> 02:26:31,430
the sort of symbolic representation of
 

7525
02:26:31,430 --> 02:26:34,570
the sort of symbolic representation of
image identification that that's where

7526
02:26:34,570 --> 02:26:34,580
image identification that that's where
 

7527
02:26:34,580 --> 02:26:36,070
image identification that that's where
things get really interesting and where

7528
02:26:36,070 --> 02:26:36,080
things get really interesting and where
 

7529
02:26:36,080 --> 02:26:37,780
things get really interesting and where
you can kind of symbolically represent

7530
02:26:37,780 --> 02:26:37,790
you can kind of symbolically represent
 

7531
02:26:37,790 --> 02:26:39,610
you can kind of symbolically represent
patterns of things and images and so on

7532
02:26:39,610 --> 02:26:39,620
patterns of things and images and so on
 

7533
02:26:39,620 --> 02:26:42,670
patterns of things and images and so on
um I think that's you know that's kind

7534
02:26:42,670 --> 02:26:42,680
um I think that's you know that's kind
 

7535
02:26:42,680 --> 02:26:44,830
um I think that's you know that's kind
of a part of the path forward so to

7536
02:26:44,830 --> 02:26:44,840
of a part of the path forward so to
 

7537
02:26:44,840 --> 02:26:46,780
of a part of the path forward so to
speak yeah so the dream of so the

7538
02:26:46,780 --> 02:26:46,790
speak yeah so the dream of so the
 

7539
02:26:46,790 --> 02:26:49,990
speak yeah so the dream of so the
machine learning is not when in my view

7540
02:26:49,990 --> 02:26:50,000
machine learning is not when in my view
 

7541
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:51,639
machine learning is not when in my view
I think the view of many people is not

7542
02:26:51,639 --> 02:26:51,649
I think the view of many people is not
 

7543
02:26:51,649 --> 02:26:54,410
I think the view of many people is not
anywhere close to building the kind of

7544
02:26:54,410 --> 02:26:54,420
anywhere close to building the kind of
 

7545
02:26:54,420 --> 02:26:57,950
anywhere close to building the kind of
wide world of computable knowledge that

7546
02:26:57,950 --> 02:26:57,960
wide world of computable knowledge that
 

7547
02:26:57,960 --> 02:27:02,240
wide world of computable knowledge that
Wolfram language would build but because

7548
02:27:02,240 --> 02:27:02,250
Wolfram language would build but because
 

7549
02:27:02,250 --> 02:27:04,190
Wolfram language would build but because
you have a kind of you've you've done

7550
02:27:04,190 --> 02:27:04,200
you have a kind of you've you've done
 

7551
02:27:04,200 --> 02:27:05,630
you have a kind of you've you've done
the incredibly hard work of building

7552
02:27:05,630 --> 02:27:05,640
the incredibly hard work of building
 

7553
02:27:05,640 --> 02:27:08,750
the incredibly hard work of building
this world now machine learning too can

7554
02:27:08,750 --> 02:27:08,760
this world now machine learning too can
 

7555
02:27:08,760 --> 02:27:10,520
this world now machine learning too can
be conservatives

7556
02:27:10,520 --> 02:27:10,530
be conservatives
 

7557
02:27:10,530 --> 02:27:12,860
be conservatives
to help you explore that world yeah and

7558
02:27:12,860 --> 02:27:12,870
to help you explore that world yeah and
 

7559
02:27:12,870 --> 02:27:15,110
to help you explore that world yeah and
that's what you've added with the

7560
02:27:15,110 --> 02:27:15,120
that's what you've added with the
 

7561
02:27:15,120 --> 02:27:17,960
that's what you've added with the
version 12 oh yeah if you all seeing

7562
02:27:17,960 --> 02:27:17,970
version 12 oh yeah if you all seeing
 

7563
02:27:17,970 --> 02:27:20,630
version 12 oh yeah if you all seeing
some demos it looks amazing right I mean

7564
02:27:20,630 --> 02:27:20,640
some demos it looks amazing right I mean
 

7565
02:27:20,640 --> 02:27:22,700
some demos it looks amazing right I mean
I think you know this it's sort of

7566
02:27:22,700 --> 02:27:22,710
I think you know this it's sort of
 

7567
02:27:22,710 --> 02:27:26,600
I think you know this it's sort of
interesting to see the this sort of the

7568
02:27:26,600 --> 02:27:26,610
interesting to see the this sort of the
 

7569
02:27:26,610 --> 02:27:28,730
interesting to see the this sort of the
once its computable once it's in there

7570
02:27:28,730 --> 02:27:28,740
once its computable once it's in there
 

7571
02:27:28,740 --> 02:27:30,710
once its computable once it's in there
it's running in sort of a very efficient

7572
02:27:30,710 --> 02:27:30,720
it's running in sort of a very efficient
 

7573
02:27:30,720 --> 02:27:32,630
it's running in sort of a very efficient
computational way but then there's sort

7574
02:27:32,630 --> 02:27:32,640
computational way but then there's sort
 

7575
02:27:32,640 --> 02:27:34,219
computational way but then there's sort
of things like the interface of how do

7576
02:27:34,219 --> 02:27:34,229
of things like the interface of how do
 

7577
02:27:34,229 --> 02:27:34,850
of things like the interface of how do
you get there

7578
02:27:34,850 --> 02:27:34,860
you get there
 

7579
02:27:34,860 --> 02:27:35,990
you get there
you know how do you do natural language

7580
02:27:35,990 --> 02:27:36,000
you know how do you do natural language
 

7581
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:37,520
you know how do you do natural language
understanding to get there how do you

7582
02:27:37,520 --> 02:27:37,530
understanding to get there how do you
 

7583
02:27:37,530 --> 02:27:39,410
understanding to get there how do you
how do you pick out entities in a big

7584
02:27:39,410 --> 02:27:39,420
how do you pick out entities in a big
 

7585
02:27:39,420 --> 02:27:42,679
how do you pick out entities in a big
piece of text or something um that's I

7586
02:27:42,679 --> 02:27:42,689
piece of text or something um that's I
 

7587
02:27:42,689 --> 02:27:44,390
piece of text or something um that's I
mean actually a good example right now

7588
02:27:44,390 --> 02:27:44,400
mean actually a good example right now
 

7589
02:27:44,400 --> 02:27:46,219
mean actually a good example right now
is our NLP NL

7590
02:27:46,219 --> 02:27:46,229
is our NLP NL
 

7591
02:27:46,229 --> 02:27:48,170
is our NLP NL
which is we've done a lot of stuff

7592
02:27:48,170 --> 02:27:48,180
which is we've done a lot of stuff
 

7593
02:27:48,180 --> 02:27:50,900
which is we've done a lot of stuff
natural language understanding using

7594
02:27:50,900 --> 02:27:50,910
natural language understanding using

to enter a query and then converting so

7604
02:28:02,360 --> 02:28:02,370
to enter a query and then converting so
 

7605
02:28:02,370 --> 02:28:05,060
to enter a query and then converting so
the process of converting NLU defined

7606
02:28:05,060 --> 02:28:05,070
the process of converting NLU defined
 

7607
02:28:05,070 --> 02:28:08,620
the process of converting NLU defined
beautifully as converting their query

beautifully as converting their query
into computation come into a

7610
02:28:10,790 --> 02:28:10,800
into computation come into a
 

7611
02:28:10,800 --> 02:28:12,920
into computation come into a
computational language which is a very

7612
02:28:12,920 --> 02:28:12,930
computational language which is a very
 

7613
02:28:12,930 --> 02:28:15,140
computational language which is a very
well first of all super practical

7614
02:28:15,140 --> 02:28:15,150
well first of all super practical
 

7615
02:28:15,150 --> 02:28:17,600
well first of all super practical
definition a very useful definition and

7616
02:28:17,600 --> 02:28:17,610
definition a very useful definition and
 

7617
02:28:17,610 --> 02:28:20,679
definition a very useful definition and
then also a very clear definition right

7618
02:28:20,679 --> 02:28:20,689
then also a very clear definition right
 

7619
02:28:20,689 --> 02:28:23,150
then also a very clear definition right
writing right having a different thing

7620
02:28:23,150 --> 02:28:23,160
writing right having a different thing
 

7621
02:28:23,160 --> 02:28:24,860
writing right having a different thing
is natural language processing where

7622
02:28:24,860 --> 02:28:24,870
is natural language processing where
 

7623
02:28:24,870 --> 02:28:27,590
is natural language processing where
it's like here's a big lump of text go

7624
02:28:27,590 --> 02:28:27,600
it's like here's a big lump of text go
 

7625
02:28:27,600 --> 02:28:29,600
it's like here's a big lump of text go
pick out all the cities in that text for

7626
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:29,610
pick out all the cities in that text for
 

7627
02:28:29,610 --> 02:28:32,030
pick out all the cities in that text for
example and so a good example you know

7628
02:28:32,030 --> 02:28:32,040
example and so a good example you know
 

7629
02:28:32,040 --> 02:28:34,850
example and so a good example you know
so we do that we're using using modern

7630
02:28:34,850 --> 02:28:34,860
so we do that we're using using modern
 

7631
02:28:34,860 --> 02:28:37,580
so we do that we're using using modern
machine learning techniques um and it's

7632
02:28:37,580 --> 02:28:37,590
machine learning techniques um and it's
 

7633
02:28:37,590 --> 02:28:39,200
machine learning techniques um and it's
actually kind of kind of an interesting

7634
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:39,210
actually kind of kind of an interesting
 

7635
02:28:39,210 --> 02:28:40,700
actually kind of kind of an interesting
process that's going on right now it's

7636
02:28:40,700 --> 02:28:40,710
process that's going on right now it's
 

7637
02:28:40,710 --> 02:28:42,950
process that's going on right now it's
this loop between what do we pick up

7638
02:28:42,950 --> 02:28:42,960
this loop between what do we pick up
 

7639
02:28:42,960 --> 02:28:46,130
this loop between what do we pick up
with NLP using machine learning versus

7640
02:28:46,130 --> 02:28:46,140
with NLP using machine learning versus
 

7641
02:28:46,140 --> 02:28:48,290
with NLP using machine learning versus
what do we pick up with our more kind of

7642
02:28:48,290 --> 02:28:48,300
what do we pick up with our more kind of
 

7643
02:28:48,300 --> 02:28:50,600
what do we pick up with our more kind of
precise computational methods in natural

7644
02:28:50,600 --> 02:28:50,610
precise computational methods in natural
 

7645
02:28:50,610 --> 02:28:52,520
precise computational methods in natural
language understanding and so we've got

7646
02:28:52,520 --> 02:28:52,530
language understanding and so we've got
 

7647
02:28:52,530 --> 02:28:53,840
language understanding and so we've got
this kind of loop going between those

7648
02:28:53,840 --> 02:28:53,850
this kind of loop going between those
 

7649
02:28:53,850 --> 02:28:55,760
this kind of loop going between those
which is improving both of them yeah I

7650
02:28:55,760 --> 02:28:55,770
which is improving both of them yeah I
 

7651
02:28:55,770 --> 02:28:57,110
which is improving both of them yeah I
think you have some of the state of the

7652
02:28:57,110 --> 02:28:57,120
think you have some of the state of the
 

7653
02:28:57,120 --> 02:28:58,700
think you have some of the state of the
art transforms okay have Bert in there I

7654
02:28:58,700 --> 02:28:58,710
art transforms okay have Bert in there I
 

7655
02:28:58,710 --> 02:29:01,070
art transforms okay have Bert in there I
think oh you know so Josey of you're

7656
02:29:01,070 --> 02:29:01,080
think oh you know so Josey of you're
 

7657
02:29:01,080 --> 02:29:03,050
think oh you know so Josey of you're
integrating all the models I mean this

7658
02:29:03,050 --> 02:29:03,060
integrating all the models I mean this
 

7659
02:29:03,060 --> 02:29:05,450
integrating all the models I mean this
is the hybrid thing that people have

7660
02:29:05,450 --> 02:29:05,460
is the hybrid thing that people have
 

7661
02:29:05,460 --> 02:29:07,010
is the hybrid thing that people have
always dreamed about are talking

7662
02:29:07,010 --> 02:29:07,020
always dreamed about are talking
 

7663
02:29:07,020 --> 02:29:10,029
always dreamed about are talking
well that makes she's just surprised

7664
02:29:10,029 --> 02:29:10,039
well that makes she's just surprised
 

7665
02:29:10,039 --> 02:29:12,080
well that makes she's just surprised
frankly that Wolfram language is not

7666
02:29:12,080 --> 02:29:12,090
frankly that Wolfram language is not
 

7667
02:29:12,090 --> 02:29:15,229
frankly that Wolfram language is not
more popular than already it already is

7668
02:29:15,229 --> 02:29:15,239
more popular than already it already is
 

7669
02:29:15,239 --> 02:29:18,109
more popular than already it already is
you know that's that's a it's a it's a

7670
02:29:18,109 --> 02:29:18,119
you know that's that's a it's a it's a
 

7671
02:29:18,119 --> 02:29:21,529
you know that's that's a it's a it's a
complicated issue because it's like it

7672
02:29:21,529 --> 02:29:21,539
complicated issue because it's like it
 

7673
02:29:21,539 --> 02:29:26,090
complicated issue because it's like it
involves you know it involves ideas and

7674
02:29:26,090 --> 02:29:26,100
involves you know it involves ideas and
 

7675
02:29:26,100 --> 02:29:28,670
involves you know it involves ideas and
ideas are absorbed absorbed slowly in

7676
02:29:28,670 --> 02:29:28,680
ideas are absorbed absorbed slowly in
 

7677
02:29:28,680 --> 02:29:30,410
ideas are absorbed absorbed slowly in
the world I mean I think that and then

7678
02:29:30,410 --> 02:29:30,420
the world I mean I think that and then
 

7679
02:29:30,420 --> 02:29:32,149
the world I mean I think that and then
there's sort of like we're talking about

7680
02:29:32,149 --> 02:29:32,159
there's sort of like we're talking about
 

7681
02:29:32,159 --> 02:29:34,069
there's sort of like we're talking about
there's egos and personalities and and

7682
02:29:34,069 --> 02:29:34,079
there's egos and personalities and and
 

7683
02:29:34,079 --> 02:29:37,300
there's egos and personalities and and
some of the the absorption absorption

7684
02:29:37,300 --> 02:29:37,310
some of the the absorption absorption
 

7685
02:29:37,310 --> 02:29:39,800
some of the the absorption absorption
mechanisms of ideas have to do with

7686
02:29:39,800 --> 02:29:39,810
mechanisms of ideas have to do with
 

7687
02:29:39,810 --> 02:29:42,260
mechanisms of ideas have to do with
personalities and the students of

7688
02:29:42,260 --> 02:29:42,270
personalities and the students of
 

7689
02:29:42,270 --> 02:29:44,510
personalities and the students of
personalities and and then a little

7690
02:29:44,510 --> 02:29:44,520
personalities and and then a little
 

7691
02:29:44,520 --> 02:29:46,580
personalities and and then a little
social network so it's it's interesting

7692
02:29:46,580 --> 02:29:46,590
social network so it's it's interesting
 

7693
02:29:46,590 --> 02:29:48,679
social network so it's it's interesting
how the spread of ideas works you know

7694
02:29:48,679 --> 02:29:48,689
how the spread of ideas works you know
 

7695
02:29:48,689 --> 02:29:50,210
how the spread of ideas works you know
what's funny with Wolfram language is

7696
02:29:50,210 --> 02:29:50,220
what's funny with Wolfram language is
 

7697
02:29:50,220 --> 02:29:53,569
what's funny with Wolfram language is
that we are if you say you know what

7698
02:29:53,569 --> 02:29:53,579
that we are if you say you know what
 

7699
02:29:53,579 --> 02:29:56,120
that we are if you say you know what
market sort of market penetration if you

7700
02:29:56,120 --> 02:29:56,130
market sort of market penetration if you
 

7701
02:29:56,130 --> 02:29:59,120
market sort of market penetration if you
look at the I would say very high-end of

7702
02:29:59,120 --> 02:29:59,130
look at the I would say very high-end of
 

7703
02:29:59,130 --> 02:30:02,059
look at the I would say very high-end of
Rd and sort of the the people where you

7704
02:30:02,059 --> 02:30:02,069
Rd and sort of the the people where you
 

7705
02:30:02,069 --> 02:30:03,620
Rd and sort of the the people where you
say wow that's a really you know

7706
02:30:03,620 --> 02:30:03,630
say wow that's a really you know
 

7707
02:30:03,630 --> 02:30:06,439
say wow that's a really you know
impressive smart person they're very

7708
02:30:06,439 --> 02:30:06,449
impressive smart person they're very
 

7709
02:30:06,449 --> 02:30:08,510
impressive smart person they're very
often users of our or from language very

7710
02:30:08,510 --> 02:30:08,520
often users of our or from language very
 

7711
02:30:08,520 --> 02:30:10,939
often users of our or from language very
very often if you look at the more sort

7712
02:30:10,939 --> 02:30:10,949
very often if you look at the more sort
 

7713
02:30:10,949 --> 02:30:13,130
very often if you look at the more sort
of it's a funny thing if you look at the

7714
02:30:13,130 --> 02:30:13,140
of it's a funny thing if you look at the
 

7715
02:30:13,140 --> 02:30:15,500
of it's a funny thing if you look at the
more kind of I would say people who are

7716
02:30:15,500 --> 02:30:15,510
more kind of I would say people who are
 

7717
02:30:15,510 --> 02:30:17,450
more kind of I would say people who are
like oh we're just plodding away doing

7718
02:30:17,450 --> 02:30:17,460
like oh we're just plodding away doing
 

7719
02:30:17,460 --> 02:30:21,019
like oh we're just plodding away doing
what we do they're often not yet well

7720
02:30:21,019 --> 02:30:21,029
what we do they're often not yet well
 

7721
02:30:21,029 --> 02:30:22,490
what we do they're often not yet well
from language users and that dynamic

7722
02:30:22,490 --> 02:30:22,500
from language users and that dynamic
 

7723
02:30:22,500 --> 02:30:24,439
from language users and that dynamic
it's kind of odd that there hasn't been

7724
02:30:24,439 --> 02:30:24,449
it's kind of odd that there hasn't been
 

7725
02:30:24,449 --> 02:30:26,779
it's kind of odd that there hasn't been
more rapid trickle down because we

7726
02:30:26,779 --> 02:30:26,789
more rapid trickle down because we
 

7727
02:30:26,789 --> 02:30:28,760
more rapid trickle down because we
really you know the high-end we've

7728
02:30:28,760 --> 02:30:28,770
really you know the high-end we've
 

7729
02:30:28,770 --> 02:30:30,620
really you know the high-end we've
really been very successful in for a

7730
02:30:30,620 --> 02:30:30,630
really been very successful in for a
 

7731
02:30:30,630 --> 02:30:33,830
really been very successful in for a
long time and it's it's some but was you

7732
02:30:33,830 --> 02:30:33,840
long time and it's it's some but was you
 

7733
02:30:33,840 --> 02:30:37,340
long time and it's it's some but was you
know that's partly I think a consequence

7734
02:30:37,340 --> 02:30:37,350
know that's partly I think a consequence
 

7735
02:30:37,350 --> 02:30:40,010
know that's partly I think a consequence
of my fault in the sense because it's

7736
02:30:40,010 --> 02:30:40,020
of my fault in the sense because it's
 

7737
02:30:40,020 --> 02:30:42,439
of my fault in the sense because it's
kind of you know I have a company which

7738
02:30:42,439 --> 02:30:42,449
kind of you know I have a company which
 

7739
02:30:42,449 --> 02:30:46,069
kind of you know I have a company which
is really emphasizes sort of creating

7740
02:30:46,069 --> 02:30:46,079
is really emphasizes sort of creating
 

7741
02:30:46,079 --> 02:30:51,050
is really emphasizes sort of creating
products and building a sort of the best

7742
02:30:51,050 --> 02:30:51,060
products and building a sort of the best
 

7743
02:30:51,060 --> 02:30:53,660
products and building a sort of the best
possible technical tower we can rather

7744
02:30:53,660 --> 02:30:53,670
possible technical tower we can rather
 

7745
02:30:53,670 --> 02:30:56,630
possible technical tower we can rather
than sort of doing the commercial side

7746
02:30:56,630 --> 02:30:56,640
than sort of doing the commercial side
 

7747
02:30:56,640 --> 02:30:59,090
than sort of doing the commercial side
of things and pumping it out and so yeah

7748
02:30:59,090 --> 02:30:59,100
of things and pumping it out and so yeah
 

7749
02:30:59,100 --> 02:31:00,319
of things and pumping it out and so yeah
most effective what and there's an

7750
02:31:00,319 --> 02:31:00,329
most effective what and there's an
 

7751
02:31:00,329 --> 02:31:02,120
most effective what and there's an
interesting idea that you know perhaps

7752
02:31:02,120 --> 02:31:02,130
interesting idea that you know perhaps
 

7753
02:31:02,130 --> 02:31:04,040
interesting idea that you know perhaps
you can make more popular by opening

7754
02:31:04,040 --> 02:31:04,050
you can make more popular by opening
 

7755
02:31:04,050 --> 02:31:07,130
you can make more popular by opening
everything everything up sort of the

7756
02:31:07,130 --> 02:31:07,140
everything everything up sort of the
 

7757
02:31:07,140 --> 02:31:08,840
everything everything up sort of the
github bottle but there's an interesting

7758
02:31:08,840 --> 02:31:08,850
github bottle but there's an interesting
 

7759
02:31:08,850 --> 02:31:10,609
github bottle but there's an interesting
I think I've heard you discussed this

7760
02:31:10,609 --> 02:31:10,619
I think I've heard you discussed this
 

7761
02:31:10,619 --> 02:31:13,340
I think I've heard you discussed this
that that turns out not to work in a lot

7762
02:31:13,340 --> 02:31:13,350
that that turns out not to work in a lot
 

7763
02:31:13,350 --> 02:31:15,319
that that turns out not to work in a lot
of cases like in this particular case

7764
02:31:15,319 --> 02:31:15,329
of cases like in this particular case
 

7765
02:31:15,329 --> 02:31:17,840
of cases like in this particular case
that you want it you know that when you

7766
02:31:17,840 --> 02:31:17,850
that you want it you know that when you
 

7767
02:31:17,850 --> 02:31:20,760
that you want it you know that when you
deeply care about the integra

7768
02:31:20,760 --> 02:31:20,770
deeply care about the integra
 

7769
02:31:20,770 --> 02:31:24,300
deeply care about the integra
really the quality of the knowledge that

7770
02:31:24,300 --> 02:31:24,310
really the quality of the knowledge that
 

7771
02:31:24,310 --> 02:31:27,420
really the quality of the knowledge that
you're building that unfortunately you

7772
02:31:27,420 --> 02:31:27,430
you're building that unfortunately you
 

7773
02:31:27,430 --> 02:31:30,649
you're building that unfortunately you
can't you can't distribute that effort

7774
02:31:30,649 --> 02:31:30,659
can't you can't distribute that effort
 

7775
02:31:30,659 --> 02:31:34,200
can't you can't distribute that effort
yeah it's not the nature of how things

7776
02:31:34,200 --> 02:31:34,210
yeah it's not the nature of how things
 

7777
02:31:34,210 --> 02:31:35,910
yeah it's not the nature of how things
work I mean you know what we're trying

7778
02:31:35,910 --> 02:31:35,920
work I mean you know what we're trying
 

7779
02:31:35,920 --> 02:31:38,010
work I mean you know what we're trying
to do is the thing that for better or

7780
02:31:38,010 --> 02:31:38,020
to do is the thing that for better or
 

7781
02:31:38,020 --> 02:31:40,679
to do is the thing that for better or
worse requires leadership and it

7782
02:31:40,679 --> 02:31:40,689
worse requires leadership and it
 

7783
02:31:40,689 --> 02:31:42,899
worse requires leadership and it
requires kind of maintaining a coherent

7784
02:31:42,899 --> 02:31:42,909
requires kind of maintaining a coherent
 

7785
02:31:42,909 --> 02:31:45,090
requires kind of maintaining a coherent
vision over a long period of time and

7786
02:31:45,090 --> 02:31:45,100
vision over a long period of time and
 

7787
02:31:45,100 --> 02:31:49,170
vision over a long period of time and
doing not only the cool vision related

7788
02:31:49,170 --> 02:31:49,180
doing not only the cool vision related
 

7789
02:31:49,180 --> 02:31:52,139
doing not only the cool vision related
work but also the kind of mundane in the

7790
02:31:52,139 --> 02:31:52,149
work but also the kind of mundane in the
 

7791
02:31:52,149 --> 02:31:53,760
work but also the kind of mundane in the
trenches make the thing actually work

7792
02:31:53,760 --> 02:31:53,770
trenches make the thing actually work
 

7793
02:31:53,770 --> 02:31:56,099
trenches make the thing actually work
well work so how do you build the

7794
02:31:56,099 --> 02:31:56,109
well work so how do you build the
 

7795
02:31:56,109 --> 02:31:58,349
well work so how do you build the
knowledge because that's the fascinating

7796
02:31:58,349 --> 02:31:58,359
knowledge because that's the fascinating
 

7797
02:31:58,359 --> 02:32:00,990
knowledge because that's the fascinating
thing that's the mundane the fascinating

7798
02:32:00,990 --> 02:32:01,000
thing that's the mundane the fascinating
 

7799
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:02,939
thing that's the mundane the fascinating
in the mundane as well building the

7800
02:32:02,939 --> 02:32:02,949
in the mundane as well building the
 

7801
02:32:02,949 --> 02:32:04,679
in the mundane as well building the
knowledge they're adding integrating

7802
02:32:04,679 --> 02:32:04,689
knowledge they're adding integrating
 

7803
02:32:04,689 --> 02:32:06,359
knowledge they're adding integrating
more data yeah I mean that's probably

7804
02:32:06,359 --> 02:32:06,369
more data yeah I mean that's probably
 

7805
02:32:06,369 --> 02:32:08,279
more data yeah I mean that's probably
not the most stunning that the things

7806
02:32:08,279 --> 02:32:08,289
not the most stunning that the things
 

7807
02:32:08,289 --> 02:32:09,779
not the most stunning that the things
like get it to work in all these

7808
02:32:09,779 --> 02:32:09,789
like get it to work in all these
 

7809
02:32:09,789 --> 02:32:11,580
like get it to work in all these
different cloud environments and so on

7810
02:32:11,580 --> 02:32:11,590
different cloud environments and so on
 

7811
02:32:11,590 --> 02:32:13,620
different cloud environments and so on
that's pretty you know it's very

7812
02:32:13,620 --> 02:32:13,630
that's pretty you know it's very
 

7813
02:32:13,630 --> 02:32:15,240
that's pretty you know it's very
practical stuff you know have the user

7814
02:32:15,240 --> 02:32:15,250
practical stuff you know have the user
 

7815
02:32:15,250 --> 02:32:17,639
practical stuff you know have the user
interface be smooth and you know have

7816
02:32:17,639 --> 02:32:17,649
interface be smooth and you know have
 

7817
02:32:17,649 --> 02:32:19,559
interface be smooth and you know have
there be take on him you know fraction

7818
02:32:19,559 --> 02:32:19,569
there be take on him you know fraction
 

7819
02:32:19,569 --> 02:32:21,000
there be take on him you know fraction
of a millisecond to do this or that

7820
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:21,010
of a millisecond to do this or that
 

7821
02:32:21,010 --> 02:32:24,450
of a millisecond to do this or that
that's a lot of work and it's some it's

7822
02:32:24,450 --> 02:32:24,460
that's a lot of work and it's some it's
 

7823
02:32:24,460 --> 02:32:28,559
that's a lot of work and it's some it's
it's but you know I think my it's an

7824
02:32:28,559 --> 02:32:28,569
it's but you know I think my it's an
 

7825
02:32:28,569 --> 02:32:29,790
it's but you know I think my it's an
interesting thing over the period of

7826
02:32:29,790 --> 02:32:29,800
interesting thing over the period of
 

7827
02:32:29,800 --> 02:32:32,179
interesting thing over the period of
time you know often language has existed

7828
02:32:32,179 --> 02:32:32,189
time you know often language has existed
 

7829
02:32:32,189 --> 02:32:34,529
time you know often language has existed
basically for more than half of the

7830
02:32:34,529 --> 02:32:34,539
basically for more than half of the
 

7831
02:32:34,539 --> 02:32:36,330
basically for more than half of the
total amount of time that any language

7832
02:32:36,330 --> 02:32:36,340
total amount of time that any language
 

7833
02:32:36,340 --> 02:32:38,040
total amount of time that any language
any computer language has existed that

7834
02:32:38,040 --> 02:32:38,050
any computer language has existed that
 

7835
02:32:38,050 --> 02:32:40,399
any computer language has existed that
is computer language maybe 60 years old

7836
02:32:40,399 --> 02:32:40,409
is computer language maybe 60 years old
 

7837
02:32:40,409 --> 02:32:44,069
is computer language maybe 60 years old
you know give or take um and both

7838
02:32:44,069 --> 02:32:44,079
you know give or take um and both
 

7839
02:32:44,079 --> 02:32:47,250
you know give or take um and both
languages 33 years old so it's it's kind

7840
02:32:47,250 --> 02:32:47,260
languages 33 years old so it's it's kind
 

7841
02:32:47,260 --> 02:32:50,370
languages 33 years old so it's it's kind
of a um and I think I was realizing

7842
02:32:50,370 --> 02:32:50,380
of a um and I think I was realizing
 

7843
02:32:50,380 --> 02:32:52,319
of a um and I think I was realizing
recently there's been more innovation in

7844
02:32:52,319 --> 02:32:52,329
recently there's been more innovation in
 

7845
02:32:52,329 --> 02:32:54,689
recently there's been more innovation in
the distribution of software than

7846
02:32:54,689 --> 02:32:54,699
the distribution of software than
 

7847
02:32:54,699 --> 02:32:56,340
the distribution of software than
probably than in the structure of

7848
02:32:56,340 --> 02:32:56,350
probably than in the structure of
 

7849
02:32:56,350 --> 02:32:58,170
probably than in the structure of
programming languages over that period

7850
02:32:58,170 --> 02:32:58,180
programming languages over that period
 

7851
02:32:58,180 --> 02:33:02,069
programming languages over that period
of time and we you know we've been sort

7852
02:33:02,069 --> 02:33:02,079
of time and we you know we've been sort
 

7853
02:33:02,079 --> 02:33:03,719
of time and we you know we've been sort
of trying to do our best to adapt to it

7854
02:33:03,719 --> 02:33:03,729
of trying to do our best to adapt to it
 

7855
02:33:03,729 --> 02:33:05,939
of trying to do our best to adapt to it
and the good news is that we have you

7856
02:33:05,939 --> 02:33:05,949
and the good news is that we have you
 

7857
02:33:05,949 --> 02:33:07,889
and the good news is that we have you
know because I have a simple private

7858
02:33:07,889 --> 02:33:07,899
know because I have a simple private
 

7859
02:33:07,899 --> 02:33:09,840
know because I have a simple private
company and so on that doesn't have you

7860
02:33:09,840 --> 02:33:09,850
company and so on that doesn't have you
 

7861
02:33:09,850 --> 02:33:11,460
company and so on that doesn't have you
know a bunch of investors you know

7862
02:33:11,460 --> 02:33:11,470
know a bunch of investors you know
 

7863
02:33:11,470 --> 02:33:13,590
know a bunch of investors you know
telling us we're gonna do this so that I

7864
02:33:13,590 --> 02:33:13,600
telling us we're gonna do this so that I
 

7865
02:33:13,600 --> 02:33:15,300
telling us we're gonna do this so that I
have lots of freedom and what we can do

7866
02:33:15,300 --> 02:33:15,310
have lots of freedom and what we can do
 

7867
02:33:15,310 --> 02:33:18,540
have lots of freedom and what we can do
and so for example we're able to oh I

7868
02:33:18,540 --> 02:33:18,550
and so for example we're able to oh I
 

7869
02:33:18,550 --> 02:33:20,040
and so for example we're able to oh I
don't know we have this free Wolfram

7870
02:33:20,040 --> 02:33:20,050
don't know we have this free Wolfram
 

7871
02:33:20,050 --> 02:33:21,929
don't know we have this free Wolfram
engine for developers which is a free

7872
02:33:21,929 --> 02:33:21,939
engine for developers which is a free
 

7873
02:33:21,939 --> 02:33:23,340
engine for developers which is a free
version for developers and we've been

7874
02:33:23,340 --> 02:33:23,350
version for developers and we've been
 

7875
02:33:23,350 --> 02:33:26,069
version for developers and we've been
you know we've there a site licenses for

7876
02:33:26,069 --> 02:33:26,079
you know we've there a site licenses for
 

7877
02:33:26,079 --> 02:33:28,170
you know we've there a site licenses for
for mathematical more from language

7878
02:33:28,170 --> 02:33:28,180
for mathematical more from language
 

7879
02:33:28,180 --> 02:33:30,120
for mathematical more from language
basically all major universities

7880
02:33:30,120 --> 02:33:30,130
basically all major universities
 

7881
02:33:30,130 --> 02:33:32,609
basically all major universities
certainly in the u.s. by now so it's

7882
02:33:32,609 --> 02:33:32,619
certainly in the u.s. by now so it's
 

7883
02:33:32,619 --> 02:33:34,470
certainly in the u.s. by now so it's
effectively free to people

7884
02:33:34,470 --> 02:33:34,480
effectively free to people
 

7885
02:33:34,480 --> 02:33:36,930
effectively free to people
and all the universities in effect and

7886
02:33:36,930 --> 02:33:36,940
and all the universities in effect and
 

7887
02:33:36,940 --> 02:33:40,411
and all the universities in effect and
you know we've been doing a progression

7888
02:33:40,411 --> 02:33:40,421
you know we've been doing a progression
 

7889
02:33:40,421 --> 02:33:42,030
you know we've been doing a progression
of things I mean different things like

7890
02:33:42,030 --> 02:33:42,040
of things I mean different things like
 

7891
02:33:42,040 --> 02:33:44,070
of things I mean different things like
Wolfram Alpha for example the main

7892
02:33:44,070 --> 02:33:44,080
Wolfram Alpha for example the main
 

7893
02:33:44,080 --> 02:33:46,020
Wolfram Alpha for example the main
website is just a free website

7894
02:33:46,020 --> 02:33:46,030
website is just a free website
 

7895
02:33:46,030 --> 02:33:49,140
website is just a free website
what is Wolfram Alpha okay it wolf now

7896
02:33:49,140 --> 02:33:49,150
what is Wolfram Alpha okay it wolf now
 

7897
02:33:49,150 --> 02:33:51,751
what is Wolfram Alpha okay it wolf now
for is a system for answering questions

7898
02:33:51,751 --> 02:33:51,761
for is a system for answering questions
 

7899
02:33:51,761 --> 02:33:54,480
for is a system for answering questions
where you ask in question with natural

7900
02:33:54,480 --> 02:33:54,490
where you ask in question with natural
 

7901
02:33:54,490 --> 02:33:56,850
where you ask in question with natural
language and it'll try and generate a

02:33:56,860 --> 02:33:58,320
language and it'll try and generate a
report telling you the answer to that

7904
02:33:58,320 --> 02:33:58,330
report telling you the answer to that
 

7905
02:33:58,330 --> 02:34:00,020
report telling you the answer to that
question so the question could be

7906
02:34:00,020 --> 02:34:00,030
question so the question could be
 

7907
02:34:00,030 --> 02:34:03,001
question so the question could be
something like you know what's the

7908
02:34:03,001 --> 02:34:03,011
something like you know what's the
 

7909
02:34:03,011 --> 02:34:05,990
something like you know what's the
population of Boston divided by New York

7910
02:34:05,990 --> 02:34:06,000
population of Boston divided by New York
 

7911
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:09,270
population of Boston divided by New York
compared to New York and it'll take

7912
02:34:09,270 --> 02:34:09,280
compared to New York and it'll take
 

7913
02:34:09,280 --> 02:34:11,301
compared to New York and it'll take
those words and give you an answer and

7914
02:34:11,301 --> 02:34:11,311
those words and give you an answer and
 

7915
02:34:11,311 --> 02:34:13,921
those words and give you an answer and
that have inverts the words into

7916
02:34:13,921 --> 02:34:13,931
that have inverts the words into
 

7917
02:34:13,931 --> 02:34:16,921
that have inverts the words into
computable not into inter Wolfen

7918
02:34:16,921 --> 02:34:16,931
computable not into inter Wolfen
 

7919
02:34:16,931 --> 02:34:18,841
computable not into inter Wolfen
language a common language and the

7920
02:34:18,841 --> 02:34:18,851
language a common language and the
 

7921
02:34:18,851 --> 02:34:20,220
language a common language and the
additional language and then could you

7922
02:34:20,220 --> 02:34:20,230
additional language and then could you
 

7923
02:34:20,230 --> 02:34:22,890
additional language and then could you
don'ts in underlying knowledge belongs

02:34:24,780 --> 02:34:24,790
to Wolfram Alpha to the Wolfram language
 

7927
02:34:24,790 --> 02:34:26,640
to Wolfram Alpha to the Wolfram language
what's the let's just call it the

7928
02:34:26,640 --> 02:34:26,650
what's the let's just call it the
 

7929
02:34:26,650 --> 02:34:28,650
what's the let's just call it the
Wolfram knowledge base knowledge base I

7930
02:34:28,650 --> 02:34:28,660
Wolfram knowledge base knowledge base I
 

7931
02:34:28,660 --> 02:34:30,570
Wolfram knowledge base knowledge base I
mean it's it's been a that's been a big

7932
02:34:30,570 --> 02:34:30,580
mean it's it's been a that's been a big
 

7933
02:34:30,580 --> 02:34:32,911
mean it's it's been a that's been a big
effort over the decades to collect all

7934
02:34:32,911 --> 02:34:32,921
effort over the decades to collect all
 

7935
02:34:32,921 --> 02:34:34,921
effort over the decades to collect all
that stuff and you know more of it flows

7936
02:34:34,921 --> 02:34:34,931
that stuff and you know more of it flows
 

7937
02:34:34,931 --> 02:34:37,621
that stuff and you know more of it flows
in every second so can you just pause on

7938
02:34:37,621 --> 02:34:37,631
in every second so can you just pause on
 

7939
02:34:37,631 --> 02:34:40,320
in every second so can you just pause on
that for a second like that's the one of

7940
02:34:40,320 --> 02:34:40,330
that for a second like that's the one of
 

7941
02:34:40,330 --> 02:34:42,121
that for a second like that's the one of
the most incredible things of course in

7942
02:34:42,121 --> 02:34:42,131
the most incredible things of course in
 

7943
02:34:42,131 --> 02:34:45,451
the most incredible things of course in
the long term were from language itself

7944
02:34:45,451 --> 02:34:45,461
the long term were from language itself
 

7945
02:34:45,461 --> 02:34:48,240
the long term were from language itself
is the fundamental thing but in the

7946
02:34:48,240 --> 02:34:48,250
is the fundamental thing but in the
 

7947
02:34:48,250 --> 02:34:51,661
is the fundamental thing but in the
amazing sort of short term the the

7948
02:34:51,661 --> 02:34:51,671
amazing sort of short term the the
 

7949
02:34:51,671 --> 02:34:53,850
amazing sort of short term the the
knowledge base is kind of incredible so

7950
02:34:53,850 --> 02:34:53,860
knowledge base is kind of incredible so
 

7951
02:34:53,860 --> 02:34:56,011
knowledge base is kind of incredible so
what's the process of building in that

7952
02:34:56,011 --> 02:34:56,021
what's the process of building in that
 

7953
02:34:56,021 --> 02:34:58,291
what's the process of building in that
knowledge base the fact that you first

7954
02:34:58,291 --> 02:34:58,301
knowledge base the fact that you first
 

7955
02:34:58,301 --> 02:34:59,520
knowledge base the fact that you first
of all from the very beginning that

7956
02:34:59,520 --> 02:34:59,530
of all from the very beginning that
 

7957
02:34:59,530 --> 02:35:01,860
of all from the very beginning that
you're brave enough to start to take on

7958
02:35:01,860 --> 02:35:01,870
you're brave enough to start to take on
 

7959
02:35:01,870 --> 02:35:06,180
you're brave enough to start to take on
the general knowledge base and how do

7960
02:35:06,180 --> 02:35:06,190
the general knowledge base and how do
 

7961
02:35:06,190 --> 02:35:09,751
the general knowledge base and how do
you go from zero to the incredible

7962
02:35:09,751 --> 02:35:09,761
you go from zero to the incredible
 

7963
02:35:09,761 --> 02:35:11,520
you go from zero to the incredible
knowledge base that you have now well

7964
02:35:11,520 --> 02:35:11,530
knowledge base that you have now well
 

7965
02:35:11,530 --> 02:35:13,230
knowledge base that you have now well
yeah it was kind of scary at some level

7966
02:35:13,230 --> 02:35:13,240
yeah it was kind of scary at some level
 

7967
02:35:13,240 --> 02:35:15,060
yeah it was kind of scary at some level
I mean I had I had wondered about doing

7968
02:35:15,060 --> 02:35:15,070
I mean I had I had wondered about doing
 

7969
02:35:15,070 --> 02:35:16,770
I mean I had I had wondered about doing
something like this since I was a kid so

7970
02:35:16,770 --> 02:35:16,780
something like this since I was a kid so
 

7971
02:35:16,780 --> 02:35:18,451
something like this since I was a kid so
it wasn't like I hadn't thought about it

7972
02:35:18,451 --> 02:35:18,461
it wasn't like I hadn't thought about it
 

7973
02:35:18,461 --> 02:35:21,570
it wasn't like I hadn't thought about it
for a while but most of us most of the

7974
02:35:21,570 --> 02:35:21,580
for a while but most of us most of the
 

7975
02:35:21,580 --> 02:35:24,900
for a while but most of us most of the
brilliant dreamers give up such a such a

7976
02:35:24,900 --> 02:35:24,910
brilliant dreamers give up such a such a
 

7977
02:35:24,910 --> 02:35:26,640
brilliant dreamers give up such a such a
difficult engineering notion at some

7978
02:35:26,640 --> 02:35:26,650
difficult engineering notion at some
 

7979
02:35:26,650 --> 02:35:29,041
difficult engineering notion at some
point right right well the thing that

7980
02:35:29,041 --> 02:35:29,051
point right right well the thing that
 

7981
02:35:29,051 --> 02:35:31,320
point right right well the thing that
happened with me which was kind of it's

7982
02:35:31,320 --> 02:35:31,330
happened with me which was kind of it's
 

7983
02:35:31,330 --> 02:35:34,081
happened with me which was kind of it's
a it's a live your own paradigm kind of

7984
02:35:34,081 --> 02:35:34,091
a it's a live your own paradigm kind of
 

7985
02:35:34,091 --> 02:35:36,421
a it's a live your own paradigm kind of
theory so basically what happened is I

7986
02:35:36,421 --> 02:35:36,431
theory so basically what happened is I
 

7987
02:35:36,431 --> 02:35:38,820
theory so basically what happened is I
had assumed that to build something like

7988
02:35:38,820 --> 02:35:38,830
had assumed that to build something like
 

7989
02:35:38,830 --> 02:35:41,341
had assumed that to build something like
wolf alpha would require sort of solving

7990
02:35:41,341 --> 02:35:41,351
wolf alpha would require sort of solving
 

7991
02:35:41,351 --> 02:35:43,530
wolf alpha would require sort of solving
the general AI problem that's what I had

7992
02:35:43,530 --> 02:35:43,540
the general AI problem that's what I had
 

7993
02:35:43,540 --> 02:35:45,900
the general AI problem that's what I had
assumed and so I kept on thinking about

7994
02:35:45,900 --> 02:35:45,910
assumed and so I kept on thinking about
 

7995
02:35:45,910 --> 02:35:47,340
assumed and so I kept on thinking about
that and I thought I don't really know

7996
02:35:47,340 --> 02:35:47,350
that and I thought I don't really know
 

7997
02:35:47,350 --> 02:35:49,830
that and I thought I don't really know
do that so I don't do anything then I

7998
02:35:49,830 --> 02:35:49,840
do that so I don't do anything then I
 

7999
02:35:49,840 --> 02:35:52,349
do that so I don't do anything then I
worked on my new kind of science project

8000
02:35:52,349 --> 02:35:52,359
worked on my new kind of science project
 

8001
02:35:52,359 --> 02:35:53,760
worked on my new kind of science project
and sort of exploring the computational

8002
02:35:53,760 --> 02:35:53,770
and sort of exploring the computational
 

8003
02:35:53,770 --> 02:35:55,620
and sort of exploring the computational
universe and came up with things like

8004
02:35:55,620 --> 02:35:55,630
universe and came up with things like
 

8005
02:35:55,630 --> 02:35:56,820
universe and came up with things like
this principle of computational

8006
02:35:56,820 --> 02:35:56,830
this principle of computational
 

8007
02:35:56,830 --> 02:35:59,460
this principle of computational
equivalence which say there is no bright

8008
02:35:59,460 --> 02:35:59,470
equivalence which say there is no bright
 

8009
02:35:59,470 --> 02:36:01,530
equivalence which say there is no bright
line between the intelligence and the

8010
02:36:01,530 --> 02:36:01,540
line between the intelligence and the
 

8011
02:36:01,540 --> 02:36:04,050
line between the intelligence and the
milli computational so I thought look

8012
02:36:04,050 --> 02:36:04,060
milli computational so I thought look
 

8013
02:36:04,060 --> 02:36:06,300
milli computational so I thought look
that's this paradigm I've built you know

8014
02:36:06,300 --> 02:36:06,310
that's this paradigm I've built you know
 

8015
02:36:06,310 --> 02:36:08,609
that's this paradigm I've built you know
now it's you know now I have to eat that

8016
02:36:08,609 --> 02:36:08,619
now it's you know now I have to eat that
 

8017
02:36:08,619 --> 02:36:10,649
now it's you know now I have to eat that
dog food myself so to speak you know

8018
02:36:10,649 --> 02:36:10,659
dog food myself so to speak you know
 

8019
02:36:10,659 --> 02:36:11,910
dog food myself so to speak you know
I've been thinking about doing this

8020
02:36:11,910 --> 02:36:11,920
I've been thinking about doing this
 

8021
02:36:11,920 --> 02:36:13,679
I've been thinking about doing this
thing with computable knowledge forever

8022
02:36:13,679 --> 02:36:13,689
thing with computable knowledge forever
 

8023
02:36:13,689 --> 02:36:16,290
thing with computable knowledge forever
and you know let me actually try and do

8024
02:36:16,290 --> 02:36:16,300
and you know let me actually try and do
 

8025
02:36:16,300 --> 02:36:19,019
and you know let me actually try and do
it and so it was you know if my if my

8026
02:36:19,019 --> 02:36:19,029
it and so it was you know if my if my
 

8027
02:36:19,029 --> 02:36:21,059
it and so it was you know if my if my
paradigm is right there miss should be

8028
02:36:21,059 --> 02:36:21,069
paradigm is right there miss should be
 

8029
02:36:21,069 --> 02:36:23,429
paradigm is right there miss should be
possible but the beginning was certainly

8030
02:36:23,429 --> 02:36:23,439
possible but the beginning was certainly
 

8031
02:36:23,439 --> 02:36:25,109
possible but the beginning was certainly
you know it's a bit daunting I remember

8032
02:36:25,109 --> 02:36:25,119
you know it's a bit daunting I remember
 

8033
02:36:25,119 --> 02:36:27,990
you know it's a bit daunting I remember
I took the the the the early team to a

8034
02:36:27,990 --> 02:36:28,000
I took the the the the early team to a
 

8035
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:29,670
I took the the the the early team to a
big reference library and we're like

8036
02:36:29,670 --> 02:36:29,680
big reference library and we're like
 

8037
02:36:29,680 --> 02:36:31,019
big reference library and we're like
looking at this reference library and

8038
02:36:31,019 --> 02:36:31,029
looking at this reference library and
 

8039
02:36:31,029 --> 02:36:33,090
looking at this reference library and
it's like you know my basic statement is

8040
02:36:33,090 --> 02:36:33,100
it's like you know my basic statement is
 

8041
02:36:33,100 --> 02:36:35,729
it's like you know my basic statement is
our goal over the next year or two is to

8042
02:36:35,729 --> 02:36:35,739
our goal over the next year or two is to
 

8043
02:36:35,739 --> 02:36:37,670
our goal over the next year or two is to
ingest everything that's in here and

8044
02:36:37,670 --> 02:36:37,680
ingest everything that's in here and
 

8045
02:36:37,680 --> 02:36:41,099
ingest everything that's in here and
that's you know it seemed very daunting

8046
02:36:41,099 --> 02:36:41,109
that's you know it seemed very daunting
 

8047
02:36:41,109 --> 02:36:43,380
that's you know it seemed very daunting
but but in a sense I was well aware of

8048
02:36:43,380 --> 02:36:43,390
but but in a sense I was well aware of
 

8049
02:36:43,390 --> 02:36:45,269
but but in a sense I was well aware of
the fact that it's finite you know the

8050
02:36:45,269 --> 02:36:45,279
the fact that it's finite you know the
 

8051
02:36:45,279 --> 02:36:46,349
the fact that it's finite you know the
fact you can walk into the reference

8052
02:36:46,349 --> 02:36:46,359
fact you can walk into the reference
 

8053
02:36:46,359 --> 02:36:48,210
fact you can walk into the reference
library it's big big thing with lots of

8054
02:36:48,210 --> 02:36:48,220
library it's big big thing with lots of
 

8055
02:36:48,220 --> 02:36:50,550
library it's big big thing with lots of

what happened

8068
02:37:02,519 --> 02:37:02,529
what happened
 

8069
02:37:02,529 --> 02:37:05,210
what happened
sort of interesting there was from a

8070
02:37:05,210 --> 02:37:05,220
sort of interesting there was from a
 

8071
02:37:05,220 --> 02:37:08,250
sort of interesting there was from a
methodology point of view was I didn't

02:37:08,250 --> 02:37:08,260
methodology point of view was I didn't
 

8073
02:37:08,260 --> 02:37:10,080

start off saying let me have a grand

8074
02:37:10,080 --> 02:37:10,090
start off saying let me have a grand

start off saying let me have a grand
theory for how all this knowledge works

8076
02:37:11,910 --> 02:37:11,920
theory for how all this knowledge works
 

8077
02:37:11,920 --> 02:37:14,580
theory for how all this knowledge works
it was like let's you know

8078
02:37:14,580 --> 02:37:14,590
it was like let's you know
 

8079
02:37:14,590 --> 02:37:16,439
it was like let's you know
implement this area this area this area

02:37:16,439 --> 02:37:16,449
implement this area this area this area
 

8081
02:37:16,449 --> 02:37:19,080
implement this area this area this area
of a few hundred areas and so on it's a

8082
02:37:19,080 --> 02:37:19,090
of a few hundred areas and so on it's a
 

8083
02:37:19,090 --> 02:37:23,040
of a few hundred areas and so on it's a
lot of work I also found that you know

8084
02:37:23,040 --> 02:37:23,050
lot of work I also found that you know
 

8085
02:37:23,050 --> 02:37:27,590
lot of work I also found that you know
I've been fortunate in that our products

8086
02:37:27,590 --> 02:37:27,600
I've been fortunate in that our products
 

8087
02:37:27,600 --> 02:37:30,929
I've been fortunate in that our products
get used by sort of the world's experts

8088
02:37:30,929 --> 02:37:30,939
get used by sort of the world's experts
 

8089
02:37:30,939 --> 02:37:32,969
get used by sort of the world's experts
and lots of areas and so that really

8090
02:37:32,969 --> 02:37:32,979
and lots of areas and so that really
 

8091
02:37:32,979 --> 02:37:34,290
and lots of areas and so that really
helped because we were able to ask

8092
02:37:34,290 --> 02:37:34,300
helped because we were able to ask
 

8093
02:37:34,300 --> 02:37:36,870
helped because we were able to ask
people you know the world expert on this

8094
02:37:36,870 --> 02:37:36,880
people you know the world expert on this
 

8095
02:37:36,880 --> 02:37:39,120
people you know the world expert on this
or that and were able to ask them for

8096
02:37:39,120 --> 02:37:39,130
or that and were able to ask them for
 

8097
02:37:39,130 --> 02:37:41,609
or that and were able to ask them for
input and so on and I found that my

8098
02:37:41,609 --> 02:37:41,619
input and so on and I found that my
 

8099
02:37:41,619 --> 02:37:44,160
input and so on and I found that my
general principle was that any area

8100
02:37:44,160 --> 02:37:44,170
general principle was that any area
 

8101
02:37:44,170 --> 02:37:46,410
general principle was that any area
where there wasn't some expert who

8102
02:37:46,410 --> 02:37:46,420
where there wasn't some expert who
 

8103
02:37:46,420 --> 02:37:48,660
where there wasn't some expert who
helped us figure out what to do wouldn't

8104
02:37:48,660 --> 02:37:48,670
helped us figure out what to do wouldn't
 

8105
02:37:48,670 --> 02:37:50,700
helped us figure out what to do wouldn't
be right and you know because our goal

8106
02:37:50,700 --> 02:37:50,710
be right and you know because our goal
 

8107
02:37:50,710 --> 02:37:52,410
be right and you know because our goal
was to kind of get to the point where we

8108
02:37:52,410 --> 02:37:52,420
was to kind of get to the point where we
 

8109
02:37:52,420 --> 02:37:54,630
was to kind of get to the point where we
had sort of true expert level knowledge

8110
02:37:54,630 --> 02:37:54,640
had sort of true expert level knowledge
 

8111
02:37:54,640 --> 02:37:57,269
had sort of true expert level knowledge
about everything and so that you know

8112
02:37:57,269 --> 02:37:57,279
about everything and so that you know
 

8113
02:37:57,279 --> 02:37:59,460
about everything and so that you know
that the ultimate goal is if there's a

8114
02:37:59,460 --> 02:37:59,470
that the ultimate goal is if there's a
 

8115
02:37:59,470 --> 02:38:00,870
that the ultimate goal is if there's a
question that can be honest

8116
02:38:00,870 --> 02:38:00,880
question that can be honest
 

8117
02:38:00,880 --> 02:38:02,610
question that can be honest
on the basis of general knowledge and a

8118
02:38:02,610 --> 02:38:02,620
on the basis of general knowledge and a
 

8119
02:38:02,620 --> 02:38:04,889
on the basis of general knowledge and a
civilization make it be automatic to be

8120
02:38:04,889 --> 02:38:04,899
civilization make it be automatic to be
 

8121
02:38:04,899 --> 02:38:06,540
civilization make it be automatic to be
able to answer that question and you

8122
02:38:06,540 --> 02:38:06,550
able to answer that question and you
 

8123
02:38:06,550 --> 02:38:10,139
able to answer that question and you
know and now well welcome I forgot used

8124
02:38:10,139 --> 02:38:10,149
know and now well welcome I forgot used
 

8125
02:38:10,149 --> 02:38:11,880
know and now well welcome I forgot used
in serie from the very beginning and

8126
02:38:11,880 --> 02:38:11,890
in serie from the very beginning and
 

8127
02:38:11,890 --> 02:38:13,950
in serie from the very beginning and
it's now a zoo isn't it Alexa and so

8128
02:38:13,950 --> 02:38:13,960
it's now a zoo isn't it Alexa and so
 

8129
02:38:13,960 --> 02:38:16,440
it's now a zoo isn't it Alexa and so
it's people are kind of getting more of

8130
02:38:16,440 --> 02:38:16,450
it's people are kind of getting more of
 

8131
02:38:16,450 --> 02:38:18,060
it's people are kind of getting more of
the you know they get more of the sense

8132
02:38:18,060 --> 02:38:18,070
the you know they get more of the sense
 

8133
02:38:18,070 --> 02:38:21,450
the you know they get more of the sense
of this is what should be possible to do

8134
02:38:21,450 --> 02:38:21,460
of this is what should be possible to do
 

8135
02:38:21,460 --> 02:38:23,850
of this is what should be possible to do
I mean in a sense the question answering

8136
02:38:23,850 --> 02:38:23,860
I mean in a sense the question answering
 

8137
02:38:23,860 --> 02:38:26,340
I mean in a sense the question answering
problem was viewed as one of the sort of

8138
02:38:26,340 --> 02:38:26,350
problem was viewed as one of the sort of
 

8139
02:38:26,350 --> 02:38:29,550
problem was viewed as one of the sort of
core AI problems for a long time I had

8140
02:38:29,550 --> 02:38:29,560
core AI problems for a long time I had
 

8141
02:38:29,560 --> 02:38:31,320
core AI problems for a long time I had
kind of an interesting experience I had

8142
02:38:31,320 --> 02:38:31,330
kind of an interesting experience I had
 

8143
02:38:31,330 --> 02:38:33,600
kind of an interesting experience I had
a friend Marvin Minsky who was a

8144
02:38:33,600 --> 02:38:33,610
a friend Marvin Minsky who was a
 

8145
02:38:33,610 --> 02:38:36,690
a friend Marvin Minsky who was a
well-known a AI person from from right

8146
02:38:36,690 --> 02:38:36,700
well-known a AI person from from right
 

8147
02:38:36,700 --> 02:38:39,240
well-known a AI person from from right
around here and I remember when my morph

8148
02:38:39,240 --> 02:38:39,250
around here and I remember when my morph
 

8149
02:38:39,250 --> 02:38:42,000
around here and I remember when my morph
mouthful was coming out um as a few

8150
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:42,010
mouthful was coming out um as a few
 

8151
02:38:42,010 --> 02:38:44,100
mouthful was coming out um as a few
weeks before it came out I think I might

8152
02:38:44,100 --> 02:38:44,110
weeks before it came out I think I might
 

8153
02:38:44,110 --> 02:38:46,740
weeks before it came out I think I might
happen to see Marvin and I said I should

8154
02:38:46,740 --> 02:38:46,750
happen to see Marvin and I said I should
 

8155
02:38:46,750 --> 02:38:48,240
happen to see Marvin and I said I should
show you this thing we have you know

8156
02:38:48,240 --> 02:38:48,250
show you this thing we have you know
 

8157
02:38:48,250 --> 02:38:50,400
show you this thing we have you know
it's a question answering system and he

8158
02:38:50,400 --> 02:38:50,410
it's a question answering system and he
 

8159
02:38:50,410 --> 02:38:53,550
it's a question answering system and he
was like okay type something and it's

8160
02:38:53,550 --> 02:38:53,560
was like okay type something and it's
 

8161
02:38:53,560 --> 02:38:55,560
was like okay type something and it's
like okay fine and then he's talking

8162
02:38:55,560 --> 02:38:55,570
like okay fine and then he's talking
 

8163
02:38:55,570 --> 02:38:56,340
like okay fine and then he's talking
about something different

8164
02:38:56,340 --> 02:38:56,350
about something different
 

8165
02:38:56,350 --> 02:38:59,520
about something different
I said no Marvin you know this time it

8166
02:38:59,520 --> 02:38:59,530
I said no Marvin you know this time it
 

8167
02:38:59,530 --> 02:39:01,889
I said no Marvin you know this time it
actually works you know look at this it

8168
02:39:01,889 --> 02:39:01,899
actually works you know look at this it
 

8169
02:39:01,899 --> 02:39:03,600
actually works you know look at this it
actually works these types in a few more

8170
02:39:03,600 --> 02:39:03,610
actually works these types in a few more
 

8171
02:39:03,610 --> 02:39:05,940
actually works these types in a few more
things there's maybe ten more things of

8172
02:39:05,940 --> 02:39:05,950
things there's maybe ten more things of
 

8173
02:39:05,950 --> 02:39:07,139
things there's maybe ten more things of
course we have a record of what he's

8174
02:39:07,139 --> 02:39:07,149
course we have a record of what he's
 

8175
02:39:07,149 --> 02:39:08,310
course we have a record of what he's
typed in which is kind of interesting

8176
02:39:08,310 --> 02:39:08,320
typed in which is kind of interesting
 

8177
02:39:08,320 --> 02:39:14,070
typed in which is kind of interesting
but can you share where his mind was in

8178
02:39:14,070 --> 02:39:14,080
but can you share where his mind was in
 

8179
02:39:14,080 --> 02:39:17,219
but can you share where his mind was in
a testing space like what whoa all kinds

8180
02:39:17,219 --> 02:39:17,229
a testing space like what whoa all kinds
 

8181
02:39:17,229 --> 02:39:18,929
a testing space like what whoa all kinds
of random things he's trying random

8182
02:39:18,929 --> 02:39:18,939
of random things he's trying random
 

8183
02:39:18,939 --> 02:39:21,150
of random things he's trying random
stuff you know medical stuff and you

8184
02:39:21,150 --> 02:39:21,160
stuff you know medical stuff and you
 

8185
02:39:21,160 --> 02:39:22,950
stuff you know medical stuff and you
know chemistry stuff and you know

8186
02:39:22,950 --> 02:39:22,960
know chemistry stuff and you know
 

8187
02:39:22,960 --> 02:39:26,010
know chemistry stuff and you know
astronomy and so on it was like like you

8188
02:39:26,010 --> 02:39:26,020
astronomy and so on it was like like you
 

8189
02:39:26,020 --> 02:39:28,139
astronomy and so on it was like like you
know after a few minutes he was like oh

8190
02:39:28,139 --> 02:39:28,149
know after a few minutes he was like oh
 

8191
02:39:28,149 --> 02:39:32,340
know after a few minutes he was like oh
my god it actually works the the but

8192
02:39:32,340 --> 02:39:32,350
my god it actually works the the but
 

8193
02:39:32,350 --> 02:39:33,840
my god it actually works the the but
that was kind of told you something

8194
02:39:33,840 --> 02:39:33,850
that was kind of told you something
 

8195
02:39:33,850 --> 02:39:35,760
that was kind of told you something
about the state you know what what

8196
02:39:35,760 --> 02:39:35,770
about the state you know what what
 

8197
02:39:35,770 --> 02:39:38,520
about the state you know what what
happened in AI because people had you

8198
02:39:38,520 --> 02:39:38,530
happened in AI because people had you
 

8199
02:39:38,530 --> 02:39:40,320
happened in AI because people had you
know in a sense by trying to solve the

8200
02:39:40,320 --> 02:39:40,330
know in a sense by trying to solve the
 

8201
02:39:40,330 --> 02:39:42,270
know in a sense by trying to solve the
bigger problem we were able to actually

8202
02:39:42,270 --> 02:39:42,280
bigger problem we were able to actually
 

8203
02:39:42,280 --> 02:39:44,190
bigger problem we were able to actually
make something that would work now to be

8204
02:39:44,190 --> 02:39:44,200
make something that would work now to be
 

8205
02:39:44,200 --> 02:39:46,050
make something that would work now to be
fair you know we had a bunch of

8206
02:39:46,050 --> 02:39:46,060
fair you know we had a bunch of
 

8207
02:39:46,060 --> 02:39:48,240
fair you know we had a bunch of
completely unfair advantages for example

8208
02:39:48,240 --> 02:39:48,250
completely unfair advantages for example
 

8209
02:39:48,250 --> 02:39:49,650
completely unfair advantages for example
we already built a bunch of often

8210
02:39:49,650 --> 02:39:49,660
we already built a bunch of often
 

8211
02:39:49,660 --> 02:39:51,719
we already built a bunch of often
language which was you know very

8212
02:39:51,719 --> 02:39:51,729
language which was you know very
 

8213
02:39:51,729 --> 02:39:55,679
language which was you know very
high-level symbolic language we had you

8214
02:39:55,679 --> 02:39:55,689
high-level symbolic language we had you
 

8215
02:39:55,689 --> 02:39:57,929
high-level symbolic language we had you
know I had the practical experience of

8216
02:39:57,929 --> 02:39:57,939
know I had the practical experience of
 

8217
02:39:57,939 --> 02:40:01,469
know I had the practical experience of
building big systems I have the sort of

02:40:01,469 --> 02:40:01,479
building big systems I have the sort of
 

8219
02:40:01,479 --> 02:40:03,990
building big systems I have the sort of
intellectual confidence to not just sort

8220
02:40:03,990 --> 02:40:04,000
intellectual confidence to not just sort
 

8221
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:05,670
intellectual confidence to not just sort
of give up and doing something like this

8222
02:40:05,670 --> 02:40:05,680
of give up and doing something like this
 

8223
02:40:05,680 --> 02:40:11,429
of give up and doing something like this
I think that the you know it is a it's

8224
02:40:11,429 --> 02:40:11,439
I think that the you know it is a it's
 

8225
02:40:11,439 --> 02:40:12,570
I think that the you know it is a it's
always a funny thing you know I've

8226
02:40:12,570 --> 02:40:12,580
always a funny thing you know I've
 

8227
02:40:12,580 --> 02:40:14,070
always a funny thing you know I've
worked on a bunch of big projects in my

8228
02:40:14,070 --> 02:40:14,080
worked on a bunch of big projects in my
 

8229
02:40:14,080 --> 02:40:14,490
worked on a bunch of big projects in my
life

8230
02:40:14,490 --> 02:40:14,500
life
 

8231
02:40:14,500 --> 02:40:17,690
life
and I would say that the you know you

8232
02:40:17,690 --> 02:40:17,700
and I would say that the you know you
 

8233
02:40:17,700 --> 02:40:19,800
and I would say that the you know you
mention ego I would also mention

8234
02:40:19,800 --> 02:40:19,810
mention ego I would also mention
 

8235
02:40:19,810 --> 02:40:22,080
mention ego I would also mention
optimism so does it very carefully I

8236
02:40:22,080 --> 02:40:22,090
optimism so does it very carefully I
 

8237
02:40:22,090 --> 02:40:24,719
optimism so does it very carefully I
mean in you know if somebody said this

8238
02:40:24,719 --> 02:40:24,729
mean in you know if somebody said this
 

8239
02:40:24,729 --> 02:40:26,490
mean in you know if somebody said this
budget is gonna take 30 years

8240
02:40:26,490 --> 02:40:26,500
budget is gonna take 30 years
 

8241
02:40:26,500 --> 02:40:31,320
budget is gonna take 30 years
um it's I you know it would be hard to

8242
02:40:31,320 --> 02:40:31,330
um it's I you know it would be hard to
 

8243
02:40:31,330 --> 02:40:33,780
um it's I you know it would be hard to
sell me on that you know I'm always in

8244
02:40:33,780 --> 02:40:33,790
sell me on that you know I'm always in
 

8245
02:40:33,790 --> 02:40:36,360
sell me on that you know I'm always in
the in the well I can kind of see a few

8246
02:40:36,360 --> 02:40:36,370
the in the well I can kind of see a few
 

8247
02:40:36,370 --> 02:40:38,849
the in the well I can kind of see a few
years you know something's gonna happen

8248
02:40:38,849 --> 02:40:38,859
years you know something's gonna happen
 

8249
02:40:38,859 --> 02:40:40,290
years you know something's gonna happen
a few years and usually it does

8250
02:40:40,290 --> 02:40:40,300
a few years and usually it does
 

8251
02:40:40,300 --> 02:40:42,210
a few years and usually it does
something happens in a few years but the

8252
02:40:42,210 --> 02:40:42,220
something happens in a few years but the
 

8253
02:40:42,220 --> 02:40:45,120
something happens in a few years but the
whole the tale can be decades long and

8254
02:40:45,120 --> 02:40:45,130
whole the tale can be decades long and
 

8255
02:40:45,130 --> 02:40:47,280
whole the tale can be decades long and
that's a that's a you know and from a

8256
02:40:47,280 --> 02:40:47,290
that's a that's a you know and from a
 

8257
02:40:47,290 --> 02:40:48,479
that's a that's a you know and from a
personal point of view or is the

8258
02:40:48,479 --> 02:40:48,489
personal point of view or is the
 

8259
02:40:48,489 --> 02:40:50,219
personal point of view or is the
challenges you end up with these

8260
02:40:50,219 --> 02:40:50,229
challenges you end up with these
 

8261
02:40:50,229 --> 02:40:52,280
challenges you end up with these
projects that have infinite tails and

8262
02:40:52,280 --> 02:40:52,290
projects that have infinite tails and
 

8263
02:40:52,290 --> 02:40:55,769
projects that have infinite tails and
the question is - the tails kind of do

8264
02:40:55,769 --> 02:40:55,779
the question is - the tails kind of do
 

8265
02:40:55,779 --> 02:40:57,809
the question is - the tails kind of do
you just drown and kind of dealing with

8266
02:40:57,809 --> 02:40:57,819
you just drown and kind of dealing with
 

8267
02:40:57,819 --> 02:41:00,540
you just drown and kind of dealing with
all of the tails of these projects and

8268
02:41:00,540 --> 02:41:00,550
all of the tails of these projects and
 

8269
02:41:00,550 --> 02:41:03,420
all of the tails of these projects and
that's that's an interesting sort of

8270
02:41:03,420 --> 02:41:03,430
that's that's an interesting sort of
 

8271
02:41:03,430 --> 02:41:05,519
that's that's an interesting sort of
personal challenge and like my efforts

8272
02:41:05,519 --> 02:41:05,529
personal challenge and like my efforts
 

8273
02:41:05,529 --> 02:41:07,800
personal challenge and like my efforts
now to work on fundamental theory or

8274
02:41:07,800 --> 02:41:07,810
now to work on fundamental theory or
 

8275
02:41:07,810 --> 02:41:08,940
now to work on fundamental theory or
physics which I've just started doing

8276
02:41:08,940 --> 02:41:08,950
physics which I've just started doing
 

8277
02:41:08,950 --> 02:41:12,809
physics which I've just started doing
and I'm having a lot of fun with it but

8278
02:41:12,809 --> 02:41:12,819
and I'm having a lot of fun with it but
 

8279
02:41:12,819 --> 02:41:14,910
and I'm having a lot of fun with it but
it's kind of you know it's it's kind of

8280
02:41:14,910 --> 02:41:14,920
it's kind of you know it's it's kind of
 

8281
02:41:14,920 --> 02:41:17,479
it's kind of you know it's it's kind of
making a bet that I can I can kind of

8282
02:41:17,479 --> 02:41:17,489
making a bet that I can I can kind of
 

8283
02:41:17,489 --> 02:41:21,000
making a bet that I can I can kind of
you know I can do that as well as doing

8284
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:21,010
you know I can do that as well as doing
 

8285
02:41:21,010 --> 02:41:23,610
you know I can do that as well as doing
the incredibly energetic things that I'm

8286
02:41:23,610 --> 02:41:23,620
the incredibly energetic things that I'm
 

8287
02:41:23,620 --> 02:41:24,960
the incredibly energetic things that I'm
trying to do with all from language and

8288
02:41:24,960 --> 02:41:24,970
trying to do with all from language and
 

8289
02:41:24,970 --> 02:41:25,229
trying to do with all from language and
so on

8290
02:41:25,229 --> 02:41:25,239
so on
 

8291
02:41:25,239 --> 02:41:28,290
so on
I mean vision yeah and underlying that I

8292
02:41:28,290 --> 02:41:28,300
I mean vision yeah and underlying that I
 

8293
02:41:28,300 --> 02:41:30,540
I mean vision yeah and underlying that I
mean I just talked for the second time

8294
02:41:30,540 --> 02:41:30,550
mean I just talked for the second time
 

8295
02:41:30,550 --> 02:41:32,969
mean I just talked for the second time
with Elon Musk and that you you to share

8296
02:41:32,969 --> 02:41:32,979
with Elon Musk and that you you to share
 

8297
02:41:32,979 --> 02:41:34,469
with Elon Musk and that you you to share
that quality a little bit of that

whatever the heck it is but that's how

8310
02:41:51,360 --> 02:41:51,370
whatever the heck it is but that's how
 

8311
02:41:51,370 --> 02:41:53,190
whatever the heck it is but that's how
you solve the impossible things yeah I

8312
02:41:53,190 --> 02:41:53,200
you solve the impossible things yeah I
 

8313
02:41:53,200 --> 02:41:55,290
you solve the impossible things yeah I
mean look at what happens and I don't

8314
02:41:55,290 --> 02:41:55,300
mean look at what happens and I don't
 

8315
02:41:55,300 --> 02:41:58,920
mean look at what happens and I don't
know you know in my own case I you know

8316
02:41:58,920 --> 02:41:58,930
know you know in my own case I you know
 

8317
02:41:58,930 --> 02:42:01,320
know you know in my own case I you know
it's been I progressed oligo a bit more

8318
02:42:01,320 --> 02:42:01,330
it's been I progressed oligo a bit more
 

8319

8321
02:42:03,819 --> 02:42:05,700

know decide that these projects aren't

8322
02:42:05,700 --> 02:42:05,710
know decide that these projects aren't
 

8323
02:42:05,710 --> 02:42:07,349
know decide that these projects aren't
crazy but then the other thing is the

8324
02:42:07,349 --> 02:42:07,359
crazy but then the other thing is the
 

8325
02:42:07,359 --> 02:42:10,440
crazy but then the other thing is the
other the other trap the one can end up

8326
02:42:10,440 --> 02:42:10,450
other the other trap the one can end up
 

8327
02:42:10,450 --> 02:42:12,690
other the other trap the one can end up
with is oh I've done these projects and

8328
02:42:12,690 --> 02:42:12,700
with is oh I've done these projects and
 

8329
02:42:12,700 --> 02:42:15,000
with is oh I've done these projects and
they're big let me never do a project

8330
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:15,010
they're big let me never do a project
 

8331
02:42:15,010 --> 02:42:16,530
they're big let me never do a project
that's any smaller than any project I've

8332
02:42:16,530 --> 02:42:16,540
that's any smaller than any project I've
 

8333
02:42:16,540 --> 02:42:19,860
that's any smaller than any project I've
done so far and that's you know and that

8334
02:42:19,860 --> 02:42:19,870
done so far and that's you know and that
 

8335
02:42:19,870 --> 02:42:21,960
done so far and that's you know and that
can be a trap and and often these

8336
02:42:21,960 --> 02:42:21,970
can be a trap and and often these
 

8337
02:42:21,970 --> 02:42:25,320
can be a trap and and often these
projects are of completely unknown you

8338
02:42:25,320 --> 02:42:25,330
projects are of completely unknown you
 

8339
02:42:25,330 --> 02:42:27,479
projects are of completely unknown you
know that their depth and significance

8340
02:42:27,479 --> 02:42:27,489
know that their depth and significance
 

8341
02:42:27,489 --> 02:42:28,440
know that their depth and significance
is actually

8342
02:42:28,440 --> 02:42:28,450

8343
02:42:28,450 --> 02:42:33,180

very hard to know yeah I'm the sort of

02:42:33,180 --> 02:42:33,190
very hard to know yeah I'm the sort of

I kind of well a bunch of different

8470
02:45:07,730 --> 02:45:07,740
I kind of well a bunch of different
 

8471
02:45:07,740 --> 02:45:09,320
I kind of well a bunch of different
things I realized about that but one

things I realized about that but one
 

8473
02:45:09,330 --> 02:45:12,650
things I realized about that but one
thing that's interesting is being able

so shocking I'm never gonna show it to
 

8483
02:45:22,021 --> 02:45:25,310
so shocking I'm never gonna show it to
people is this thing so whatever and and

people is this thing so whatever and and
 

8485
02:45:25,320 --> 02:45:27,200
people is this thing so whatever and and
I did realize in thinking about that

8486
02:45:27,200 --> 02:45:27,210
I did realize in thinking about that
 

8487
02:45:27,210 --> 02:45:29,270
I did realize in thinking about that
that you know there's not gonna be one

8488
02:45:29,270 --> 02:45:29,280
that you know there's not gonna be one
 

8489
02:45:29,280 --> 02:45:31,131
that you know there's not gonna be one
of these things it's not possible to

8490
02:45:31,131 --> 02:45:31,141
of these things it's not possible to
 

8491
02:45:31,141 --> 02:45:33,410
of these things it's not possible to
decide or it might be possible but it

8492
02:45:33,410 --> 02:45:33,420
decide or it might be possible but it
 

8493
02:45:33,420 --> 02:45:34,790
decide or it might be possible but it
would be really bad for the future of

8494
02:45:34,790 --> 02:45:34,800
would be really bad for the future of
 

8495
02:45:34,800 --> 02:45:37,100
would be really bad for the future of
our species if we just decided there's

8496
02:45:37,100 --> 02:45:37,110
our species if we just decided there's
 

8497
02:45:37,110 --> 02:45:39,950

this one AI FX module and it's going to

8498
02:45:39,950 --> 02:45:39,960
this one AI FX module and it's going to
 

8499
02:45:39,960 --> 02:45:42,740
this one AI FX module and it's going to
determine the the the practices of

8500
02:45:42,740 --> 02:45:42,750
determine the the the practices of
 

8501
02:45:42,750 --> 02:45:45,020
determine the the the practices of
everything in the world so to speak and

8502
02:45:45,020 --> 02:45:45,030
everything in the world so to speak and
 

8503
02:45:45,030 --> 02:45:46,461
everything in the world so to speak and
I kind of realized one has to sort of

8504
02:45:46,461 --> 02:45:46,471
I kind of realized one has to sort of
 

8505
02:45:46,471 --> 02:45:47,930
I kind of realized one has to sort of
break it up and that's an that's an

8506
02:45:47,930 --> 02:45:47,940
break it up and that's an that's an
 

8507
02:45:47,940 --> 02:45:49,881
break it up and that's an that's an
interesting societal problem of how one

8508
02:45:49,881 --> 02:45:49,891
interesting societal problem of how one
 

8509
02:45:49,891 --> 02:45:52,790
interesting societal problem of how one
does that and how one sort of has people

8510
02:45:52,790 --> 02:45:52,800
does that and how one sort of has people
 

8511
02:45:52,800 --> 02:45:55,310
does that and how one sort of has people
sort of self-identify for you know I'm

8512
02:45:55,310 --> 02:45:55,320
sort of self-identify for you know I'm
 

8513
02:45:55,320 --> 02:45:56,961
sort of self-identify for you know I'm
buying in in the case of just content

8514
02:45:56,961 --> 02:45:56,971
buying in in the case of just content
 

8515
02:45:56,971 --> 02:45:58,790
buying in in the case of just content
selection it's sort of easier because

8516
02:45:58,790 --> 02:45:58,800
selection it's sort of easier because
 

8517
02:45:58,800 --> 02:46:00,350
selection it's sort of easier because
it's like an individual's for an

8518
02:46:00,350 --> 02:46:00,360
it's like an individual's for an
 

8519
02:46:00,360 --> 02:46:03,020
it's like an individual's for an
individual it's not something that kind

8520
02:46:03,020 --> 02:46:03,030
individual it's not something that kind
 

8521
02:46:03,030 --> 02:46:05,780
individual it's not something that kind
of cuts across sort of societal

8522
02:46:05,780 --> 02:46:05,790
of cuts across sort of societal
 

8523
02:46:05,790 --> 02:46:07,820
of cuts across sort of societal
boundaries but it's a really interesting

8524
02:46:07,820 --> 02:46:07,830
boundaries but it's a really interesting
 

8525
02:46:07,830 --> 02:46:12,440
boundaries but it's a really interesting
notion of I heard you'd describe I

8526
02:46:12,440 --> 02:46:12,450
notion of I heard you'd describe I
 

8527
02:46:12,450 --> 02:46:16,370
notion of I heard you'd describe I
really like it sort of maybe in the sort

8528
02:46:16,370 --> 02:46:16,380
really like it sort of maybe in the sort
 

8529
02:46:16,380 --> 02:46:18,770
really like it sort of maybe in the sort
of have different AI systems that have a

8530
02:46:18,770 --> 02:46:18,780
of have different AI systems that have a
 

8531
02:46:18,780 --> 02:46:20,000
of have different AI systems that have a
certain kind of brand that they

8532
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:20,010
certain kind of brand that they
 

8533
02:46:20,010 --> 02:46:22,011
certain kind of brand that they
represent essentially Rowdy you could

8534
02:46:22,011 --> 02:46:22,021
represent essentially Rowdy you could
 

8535
02:46:22,021 --> 02:46:25,011
represent essentially Rowdy you could
have like I don't know whether it's

8536
02:46:25,011 --> 02:46:25,021
have like I don't know whether it's
 

8537
02:46:25,021 --> 02:46:27,680
have like I don't know whether it's
conserve conservative or liberal and

8538
02:46:27,680 --> 02:46:27,690
conserve conservative or liberal and
 

8539
02:46:27,690 --> 02:46:30,290
conserve conservative or liberal and
then libertarian and there's an R and E

8540
02:46:30,290 --> 02:46:30,300
then libertarian and there's an R and E
 

8541
02:46:30,300 --> 02:46:33,620
then libertarian and there's an R and E
an Objectivist I exist I'm a different

an Objectivist I exist I'm a different
 

8543
02:46:33,630 --> 02:46:35,860
an Objectivist I exist I'm a different
ethical and Co I mean it's almost

8544
02:46:35,860 --> 02:46:35,870
ethical and Co I mean it's almost
 

8545
02:46:35,870 --> 02:46:38,180
ethical and Co I mean it's almost
encoding some of the ideologies which

encoding some of the ideologies which
 

8547
02:46:38,190 --> 02:46:39,770
encoding some of the ideologies which
we've been struggling I come from a

02:46:39,770 --> 02:46:39,780
we've been struggling I come from a
 

8549
02:46:39,780 --> 02:46:41,690
we've been struggling I come from a
Soviet Union that didn't work out so

8550
02:46:41,690 --> 02:46:41,700
Soviet Union that didn't work out so
 

8551
02:46:41,700 --> 02:46:44,091
Soviet Union that didn't work out so
well with the ideologies they worked out

8552
02:46:44,091 --> 02:46:44,101
well with the ideologies they worked out
 

8553
02:46:44,101 --> 02:46:46,660
well with the ideologies they worked out
there so you you have but they also

8554
02:46:46,660 --> 02:46:46,670
there so you you have but they also
 

8555
02:46:46,670 --> 02:46:49,190
there so you you have but they also
everybody purchased that particular

8556
02:46:49,190 --> 02:46:49,200
everybody purchased that particular
 

8557
02:46:49,200 --> 02:46:52,761
everybody purchased that particular
ethic system indeed and in the same I

8558
02:46:52,761 --> 02:46:52,771
ethic system indeed and in the same I
 

8559
02:46:52,771 --> 02:46:54,930
ethic system indeed and in the same I
suppose could be done encoded

8560
02:46:54,930 --> 02:46:54,940
suppose could be done encoded
 

8561
02:46:54,940 --> 02:46:57,831
suppose could be done encoded
that that system could be encoded into

8562
02:46:57,831 --> 02:46:57,841
that that system could be encoded into
 

8563
02:46:57,841 --> 02:47:01,591
that that system could be encoded into
computational knowledge and allow us to

02:47:01,591 --> 02:47:01,601
computational knowledge and allow us to
 

8565
02:47:01,601 --> 02:47:03,631
computational knowledge and allow us to
explore in the realm of in the digital

8573
02:47:10,870 --> 02:47:13,140
ideas and or from language yeah yeah I
mean the the the you know that's we open

8574
02:47:13,140 --> 02:47:13,150
mean the the the you know that's we open
 

8575
02:47:13,150 --> 02:47:14,690
mean the the the you know that's we open
language has sort of the best

8576
02:47:14,690 --> 02:47:14,700
language has sort of the best
 

8577
02:47:14,700 --> 02:47:16,860
language has sort of the best
opportunity to kind of express those

8578
02:47:16,860 --> 02:47:16,870
opportunity to kind of express those
 

8579
02:47:16,870 --> 02:47:18,480
opportunity to kind of express those
essentially computational contracts

02:47:18,480 --> 02:47:18,490
essentially computational contracts

02:47:18,490 --> 02:47:20,070
essentially computational contracts
about what to do now there's a bunch

8582
02:47:20,070 --> 02:47:20,080
about what to do now there's a bunch
 

8583
02:47:20,080 --> 02:47:22,110
about what to do now there's a bunch
more work to be done to do it in

8584
02:47:22,110 --> 02:47:22,120
more work to be done to do it in
 

8585
02:47:22,120 --> 02:47:25,110
more work to be done to do it in
practice for you know deciding the is

this a credible news story what does

8588
02:47:26,820 --> 02:47:26,830
this a credible news story what does
 

8589
02:47:26,830 --> 02:47:28,320
this a credible news story what does
that mean or whatever whatever else

you're going to pick I think that that's

8592
02:47:30,121 --> 02:47:30,131
you're going to pick I think that that's
 

8593
02:47:30,131 --> 02:47:34,381
you're going to pick I think that that's
some you know that's the the question of

8594
02:47:34,381 --> 02:47:34,391
some you know that's the the question of
 

8595
02:47:34,391 --> 02:47:36,001
some you know that's the the question of
well exactly what we get to do with that

8596
02:47:36,001 --> 02:47:36,011
well exactly what we get to do with that
 

8597
02:47:36,011 --> 02:47:40,320
well exactly what we get to do with that
is you know for me it's kind of a

8598
02:47:40,320 --> 02:47:40,330
is you know for me it's kind of a
 

8599
02:47:40,330 --> 02:47:42,150
is you know for me it's kind of a
complicated thing because there are

8600
02:47:42,150 --> 02:47:42,160
complicated thing because there are
 

8601
02:47:42,160 --> 02:47:44,070
complicated thing because there are
these big projects that I think about

8602
02:47:44,070 --> 02:47:44,080
these big projects that I think about
 

8603
02:47:44,080 --> 02:47:45,541
these big projects that I think about
like you know find the fundamental

8604
02:47:45,541 --> 02:47:45,551
like you know find the fundamental
 

8605
02:47:45,551 --> 02:47:47,400
like you know find the fundamental
theory physics okay that's a possible

8606
02:47:47,400 --> 02:47:47,410
theory physics okay that's a possible
 

8607
02:47:47,410 --> 02:47:49,801
theory physics okay that's a possible
one right bucks number two you know

8608
02:47:49,801 --> 02:47:49,811
one right bucks number two you know
 

8609
02:47:49,811 --> 02:47:52,501
one right bucks number two you know
solve the IIx problem in the case of you

8610
02:47:52,501 --> 02:47:52,511
solve the IIx problem in the case of you
 

8611
02:47:52,511 --> 02:47:54,871
solve the IIx problem in the case of you
know figure out how you rank old content

8612
02:47:54,871 --> 02:47:54,881
know figure out how you rank old content
 

8613
02:47:54,881 --> 02:47:56,551
know figure out how you rank old content
so to speak and and decide what people

8614
02:47:56,551 --> 02:47:56,561
so to speak and and decide what people
 

8615
02:47:56,561 --> 02:47:58,350
so to speak and and decide what people
see that's that's kind of a box number

8616
02:47:58,350 --> 02:47:58,360
see that's that's kind of a box number
 

8617
02:47:58,360 --> 02:48:00,421
see that's that's kind of a box number
two so to speak these are big projects

8618
02:48:00,421 --> 02:48:00,431
two so to speak these are big projects
 

8619
02:48:00,431 --> 02:48:02,161
two so to speak these are big projects
and and I think waiting is more

8620
02:48:02,161 --> 02:48:02,171
and and I think waiting is more
 

8621
02:48:02,171 --> 02:48:04,291
and and I think waiting is more
important the the fundamental nature of

8622
02:48:04,291 --> 02:48:04,301
important the the fundamental nature of
 

8623
02:48:04,301 --> 02:48:07,560
important the the fundamental nature of
reality or pennsville you ask it's one

8624
02:48:07,560 --> 02:48:07,570
reality or pennsville you ask it's one
 

8625
02:48:07,570 --> 02:48:09,511
reality or pennsville you ask it's one
of these things that's exactly like you

8626
02:48:09,511 --> 02:48:09,521
of these things that's exactly like you
 

8627
02:48:09,521 --> 02:48:11,041
of these things that's exactly like you
know what's the ranking right it's the

8628
02:48:11,041 --> 02:48:11,051
know what's the ranking right it's the
 

8629
02:48:11,051 --> 02:48:13,081
know what's the ranking right it's the
it's the ranking system and it's like

8630
02:48:13,081 --> 02:48:13,091
it's the ranking system and it's like
 

8631
02:48:13,091 --> 02:48:15,060
it's the ranking system and it's like
who's who's module do you use to rank

8632
02:48:15,060 --> 02:48:15,070
who's who's module do you use to rank
 

8633
02:48:15,070 --> 02:48:18,720
who's who's module do you use to rank
that if you and I think come having

8634
02:48:18,720 --> 02:48:18,730
that if you and I think come having
 

8635
02:48:18,730 --> 02:48:20,341
that if you and I think come having
multiple modules is really compelling

8636
02:48:20,341 --> 02:48:20,351
multiple modules is really compelling
 

8637
02:48:20,351 --> 02:48:23,011
multiple modules is really compelling
notion to us humans in a world where

8638
02:48:23,011 --> 02:48:23,021
notion to us humans in a world where
 

8639
02:48:23,021 --> 02:48:24,690
notion to us humans in a world where
there's not clear that there's a right

there's not clear that there's a right
 

8641
02:48:24,700 --> 02:48:29,121
there's not clear that there's a right
answer it perhaps you have systems that

8642
02:48:29,121 --> 02:48:29,131
answer it perhaps you have systems that
 

8643
02:48:29,131 --> 02:48:34,560
answer it perhaps you have systems that
operate under different how would you

8644
02:48:34,560 --> 02:48:34,570
operate under different how would you
 

8645
02:48:34,570 --> 02:48:36,661
operate under different how would you
say it I mean there's different value

8646
02:48:36,661 --> 02:48:36,671
say it I mean there's different value
 

8647
02:48:36,671 --> 02:48:38,310
say it I mean there's different value
systems based different value systems I

8648
02:48:38,310 --> 02:48:38,320
systems based different value systems I
 

8649
02:48:38,320 --> 02:48:41,400
systems based different value systems I
mean I think you know in a sense the I

8651
02:48:41,410 --> 02:48:44,100
mean I think you know in a sense the I
mean I'm not really a politics oriented

8652
02:48:44,100 --> 02:48:44,110
mean I'm not really a politics oriented
 

8653
02:48:44,110 --> 02:48:45,890
mean I'm not really a politics oriented
person but but you know in the kind of

8654
02:48:45,890 --> 02:48:45,900
person but but you know in the kind of
 

8655
02:48:45,900 --> 02:48:48,121
person but but you know in the kind of
totalitarianism it's kind of like you're

8656
02:48:48,121 --> 02:48:48,131
totalitarianism it's kind of like you're
 

8657
02:48:48,131 --> 02:48:50,970
totalitarianism it's kind of like you're
gonna have this this system and that's

8658
02:48:50,970 --> 02:48:50,980
gonna have this this system and that's
 

8659
02:48:50,980 --> 02:48:53,461
gonna have this this system and that's
the way it is I mean kind of the you

8660
02:48:53,461 --> 02:48:53,471
the way it is I mean kind of the you
 

8661
02:48:53,471 --> 02:48:54,720
the way it is I mean kind of the you
know the concept is sort of a

8662
02:48:54,720 --> 02:48:54,730
know the concept is sort of a
 

8663
02:48:54,730 --> 02:48:57,990
know the concept is sort of a
market-based system where you have okay

8664
02:48:57,990 --> 02:48:58,000
market-based system where you have okay
 

8665
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,150

8669
02:49:01,750 --> 02:49:04,560
I is another human I'm going to pick
this system I mean that's in a sense

8670
02:49:04,560 --> 02:49:04,570
this system I mean that's in a sense
 

8671
02:49:04,570 --> 02:49:07,550
this system I mean that's in a sense
this case of automated content selection

8672
02:49:07,550 --> 02:49:07,560
this case of automated content selection
 

8673
02:49:07,560 --> 02:49:11,059
this case of automated content selection
is a non-trivial but it is probably the

8674
02:49:11,059 --> 02:49:11,069
is a non-trivial but it is probably the
 

8675
02:49:11,069 --> 02:49:13,159
is a non-trivial but it is probably the
easiest of the AI ethics situations

8676
02:49:13,159 --> 02:49:13,169
easiest of the AI ethics situations
 

8677
02:49:13,169 --> 02:49:15,260
easiest of the AI ethics situations
because it is each person gets to pick

8678
02:49:15,260 --> 02:49:15,270
because it is each person gets to pick
 

8679
02:49:15,270 --> 02:49:17,319
because it is each person gets to pick
for themselves and there's not a huge

8680
02:49:17,319 --> 02:49:17,329
for themselves and there's not a huge
 

8681
02:49:17,329 --> 02:49:19,399
for themselves and there's not a huge
interplay between what different people

8682
02:49:19,399 --> 02:49:19,409
interplay between what different people
 

8683
02:49:19,409 --> 02:49:21,319
interplay between what different people
pick by the time you're dealing with

8684
02:49:21,319 --> 02:49:21,329
pick by the time you're dealing with
 

8685
02:49:21,329 --> 02:49:24,829
pick by the time you're dealing with
other societal things like you know what

8686
02:49:24,829 --> 02:49:24,839
other societal things like you know what
 

8687
02:49:24,839 --> 02:49:26,630
other societal things like you know what
should the policy of the central bank be

8688
02:49:26,630 --> 02:49:26,640
should the policy of the central bank be
 

8689
02:49:26,640 --> 02:49:29,119
should the policy of the central bank be
or something or healthcare so now this

8690
02:49:29,119 --> 02:49:29,129
or something or healthcare so now this
 

8691
02:49:29,129 --> 02:49:30,889
or something or healthcare so now this
kind of centralized kind of things right

8692
02:49:30,889 --> 02:49:30,899
kind of centralized kind of things right
 

8693
02:49:30,899 --> 02:49:32,659
kind of centralized kind of things right
well I mean healthcare again has the

8694
02:49:32,659 --> 02:49:32,669
well I mean healthcare again has the
 

8695
02:49:32,669 --> 02:49:34,789
well I mean healthcare again has the
feature that that at some level each

8696
02:49:34,789 --> 02:49:34,799
feature that that at some level each
 

8697
02:49:34,799 --> 02:49:36,380
feature that that at some level each
person can pick for themselves so to

8698
02:49:36,380 --> 02:49:36,390
person can pick for themselves so to
 

8699
02:49:36,390 --> 02:49:36,920
person can pick for themselves so to
speak

8700
02:49:36,920 --> 02:49:36,930
speak
 

8701
02:49:36,930 --> 02:49:38,389
speak
I mean whereas there are other things

8702
02:49:38,389 --> 02:49:38,399
I mean whereas there are other things
 

8703
02:49:38,399 --> 02:49:40,309
I mean whereas there are other things
where there's a necessary Public Health

8704
02:49:40,309 --> 02:49:40,319
where there's a necessary Public Health
 

8705
02:49:40,319 --> 02:49:42,189
where there's a necessary Public Health
that's one example well that's not

8706
02:49:42,189 --> 02:49:42,199
that's one example well that's not
 

8707
02:49:42,199 --> 02:49:44,659
that's one example well that's not
whether it doesn't get to be you know

8708
02:49:44,659 --> 02:49:44,669
whether it doesn't get to be you know
 

8709
02:49:44,669 --> 02:49:46,849
whether it doesn't get to be you know
something which people can what they

8710
02:49:46,849 --> 02:49:46,859
something which people can what they
 

8711
02:49:46,859 --> 02:49:49,039
something which people can what they
pick for themselves they may impose on

8712
02:49:49,039 --> 02:49:49,049
pick for themselves they may impose on
 

8713
02:49:49,049 --> 02:49:50,719
pick for themselves they may impose on
other people and then it becomes a more

8714
02:49:50,719 --> 02:49:50,729
other people and then it becomes a more
 

8715
02:49:50,729 --> 02:49:52,819
other people and then it becomes a more
non-trivial piece of sort of political

8716
02:49:52,819 --> 02:49:52,829
non-trivial piece of sort of political
 

8717
02:49:52,829 --> 02:49:54,409
non-trivial piece of sort of political
philosophy of course the central banking

system some would argue we would move we

8720
02:49:56,389 --> 02:49:56,399
system some would argue we would move we
 

8721
02:49:56,399 --> 02:49:58,250
system some would argue we would move we
need to move away into digital currency

8722
02:49:58,250 --> 02:49:58,260
need to move away into digital currency
 

8723
02:49:58,260 --> 02:50:00,109
need to move away into digital currency
and so on and Bitcoin and Ledger's and

8724
02:50:00,109 --> 02:50:00,119
and so on and Bitcoin and Ledger's and
 

8725
02:50:00,119 --> 02:50:03,109
and so on and Bitcoin and Ledger's and
so on so yes there's a lot of we've been

8726
02:50:03,109 --> 02:50:03,119
so on so yes there's a lot of we've been
 

8727
02:50:03,119 --> 02:50:05,059
so on so yes there's a lot of we've been
quite involved in that and that's where

8728
02:50:05,059 --> 02:50:05,069
quite involved in that and that's where
 

8729
02:50:05,069 --> 02:50:06,710
quite involved in that and that's where
that's sort of the motivation for

8730
02:50:06,710 --> 02:50:06,720
that's sort of the motivation for
 

8731
02:50:06,720 --> 02:50:09,590
that's sort of the motivation for
computational contracts in part comes

8732
02:50:09,590 --> 02:50:09,600
computational contracts in part comes
 

8733
02:50:09,600 --> 02:50:11,869
computational contracts in part comes
out of you know this idea oh we can just

8734
02:50:11,869 --> 02:50:11,879
out of you know this idea oh we can just
 

8735
02:50:11,879 --> 02:50:13,849
out of you know this idea oh we can just
have this autonomously executing smart

8736
02:50:13,849 --> 02:50:13,859
have this autonomously executing smart
 

8737
02:50:13,859 --> 02:50:16,489
have this autonomously executing smart
contract the idea of a computational

8738
02:50:16,489 --> 02:50:16,499
contract the idea of a computational
 

8739
02:50:16,499 --> 02:50:19,699
contract the idea of a computational
contract is just to say you know have

8740
02:50:19,699 --> 02:50:19,709
contract is just to say you know have
 

8741
02:50:19,709 --> 02:50:22,429
contract is just to say you know have
something where all of the conditions of

8742
02:50:22,429 --> 02:50:22,439
something where all of the conditions of
 

8743
02:50:22,439 --> 02:50:23,630
something where all of the conditions of
the contract are represented in

8744
02:50:23,630 --> 02:50:23,640
the contract are represented in
 

8745
02:50:23,640 --> 02:50:25,849
the contract are represented in
computational form so in principle it's

8746
02:50:25,849 --> 02:50:25,859
computational form so in principle it's
 

8747
02:50:25,859 --> 02:50:28,670
computational form so in principle it's
automatic text secured the contract and

8748
02:50:28,670 --> 02:50:28,680
automatic text secured the contract and
 

8749
02:50:28,680 --> 02:50:31,219
automatic text secured the contract and
I think that's you know that will surely

8750
02:50:31,219 --> 02:50:31,229
I think that's you know that will surely
 

8751
02:50:31,229 --> 02:50:33,500
I think that's you know that will surely
be the future of you know the idea of

8752
02:50:33,500 --> 02:50:33,510
be the future of you know the idea of
 

8753
02:50:33,510 --> 02:50:35,539
be the future of you know the idea of
legal contracts written in English or

8754
02:50:35,539 --> 02:50:35,549
legal contracts written in English or
 

8755
02:50:35,549 --> 02:50:37,969
legal contracts written in English or
legalese or whatever and where people

8756
02:50:37,969 --> 02:50:37,979
legalese or whatever and where people
 

8757
02:50:37,979 --> 02:50:41,599
legalese or whatever and where people
have to argue about what goes on is is

8758
02:50:41,599 --> 02:50:41,609
have to argue about what goes on is is
 

8759
02:50:41,609 --> 02:50:45,050
have to argue about what goes on is is
surely not you know we have a much more

8760
02:50:45,050 --> 02:50:45,060
surely not you know we have a much more
 

8761
02:50:45,060 --> 02:50:47,359
surely not you know we have a much more
streamlined process if everything can be

8762
02:50:47,359 --> 02:50:47,369
streamlined process if everything can be
 

8763
02:50:47,369 --> 02:50:48,769
streamlined process if everything can be
represented computationally and the

8764
02:50:48,769 --> 02:50:48,779
represented computationally and the
 

8765
02:50:48,779 --> 02:50:50,239
represented computationally and the
computers can kind of decide what to do

8766
02:50:50,239 --> 02:50:50,249
computers can kind of decide what to do

02:50:50,249 --> 02:50:52,729

that never really worked properly

8780
02:51:06,739 --> 02:51:06,749
that never really worked properly
 

8781
02:51:06,749 --> 02:51:10,099
that never really worked properly
actually um and you know so he was like

8782
02:51:10,099 --> 02:51:10,109
actually um and you know so he was like
 

8783
02:51:10,109 --> 02:51:12,649
actually um and you know so he was like
300 years too early for that idea but

8784
02:51:12,649 --> 02:51:12,659
300 years too early for that idea but
 

8785
02:51:12,659 --> 02:51:15,409
300 years too early for that idea but
now that idea is pretty realistic I

8786
02:51:15,409 --> 02:51:15,419
now that idea is pretty realistic I
 

8787
02:51:15,419 --> 02:51:17,689
now that idea is pretty realistic I
think and you know you ask how much more

8788
02:51:17,689 --> 02:51:17,699
think and you know you ask how much more
 

8789
02:51:17,699 --> 02:51:19,399
think and you know you ask how much more
difficult is it than what we have now a

8790
02:51:19,399 --> 02:51:19,409
difficult is it than what we have now a
 

8791
02:51:19,409 --> 02:51:20,841
difficult is it than what we have now a
more from language to

8792
02:51:20,841 --> 02:51:20,851
more from language to
 

8793
02:51:20,851 --> 02:51:22,821
more from language to
express I call it symbolic discourse

8794
02:51:22,821 --> 02:51:22,831
express I call it symbolic discourse
 

8795
02:51:22,831 --> 02:51:25,161
express I call it symbolic discourse
language being able to express sort of

8796
02:51:25,161 --> 02:51:25,171
language being able to express sort of
 

8797
02:51:25,171 --> 02:51:27,140
language being able to express sort of
everything in the world and kind of

8798
02:51:27,140 --> 02:51:27,150
everything in the world and kind of
 

8799
02:51:27,150 --> 02:51:30,650
everything in the world and kind of
computational symbolic form um I I think

8800
02:51:30,650 --> 02:51:30,660
computational symbolic form um I I think
 

8801
02:51:30,660 --> 02:51:32,810
computational symbolic form um I I think
it is absolutely within reach I mean I

8802
02:51:32,810 --> 02:51:32,820
it is absolutely within reach I mean I
 

8803
02:51:32,820 --> 02:51:34,520
it is absolutely within reach I mean I
think it's a you know I don't know maybe

8804
02:51:34,520 --> 02:51:34,530
think it's a you know I don't know maybe
 

8805
02:51:34,530 --> 02:51:35,930
think it's a you know I don't know maybe
I'm just too much of an optimist but I

8806
02:51:35,930 --> 02:51:35,940
I'm just too much of an optimist but I
 

8807
02:51:35,940 --> 02:51:37,970
I'm just too much of an optimist but I
think it's a it's a limited number of

8808
02:51:37,970 --> 02:51:37,980
think it's a it's a limited number of
 

8809
02:51:37,980 --> 02:51:39,680
think it's a it's a limited number of
years to have a pretty well built out

8810
02:51:39,680 --> 02:51:39,690
years to have a pretty well built out
 

8811
02:51:39,690 --> 02:51:41,781
years to have a pretty well built out
version of that that will allow one to

8812
02:51:41,781 --> 02:51:41,791
version of that that will allow one to
 

8813
02:51:41,791 --> 02:51:43,430
version of that that will allow one to
encode the kinds of things that are

8814
02:51:43,430 --> 02:51:43,440
encode the kinds of things that are
 

8815
02:51:43,440 --> 02:51:47,060
encode the kinds of things that are
relevant to typical legal contracts and

8816
02:51:47,060 --> 02:51:47,070
relevant to typical legal contracts and
 

8817
02:51:47,070 --> 02:51:48,621
relevant to typical legal contracts and
these kinds of things

8818
02:51:48,621 --> 02:51:48,631
these kinds of things
 

8819
02:51:48,631 --> 02:51:52,190
these kinds of things
the idea of symbolic discourse language

8820
02:51:52,190 --> 02:51:52,200
the idea of symbolic discourse language
 

8821
02:51:52,200 --> 02:51:56,930
the idea of symbolic discourse language
can you try to define the scope of what

8822
02:51:56,930 --> 02:51:56,940
can you try to define the scope of what
 

8823
02:51:56,940 --> 02:51:59,571
can you try to define the scope of what
of what it is so we're having a

8824
02:51:59,571 --> 02:51:59,581
of what it is so we're having a
 

8825
02:51:59,581 --> 02:52:02,600
of what it is so we're having a
conversation it's a natural language can

8826
02:52:02,600 --> 02:52:02,610
conversation it's a natural language can
 

8827
02:52:02,610 --> 02:52:05,360
conversation it's a natural language can
we have a representation of these sort

8828
02:52:05,360 --> 02:52:05,370
we have a representation of these sort
 

8829
02:52:05,370 --> 02:52:07,520
we have a representation of these sort
of actionable parts of that conversation

8830
02:52:07,520 --> 02:52:07,530
of actionable parts of that conversation
 

8831
02:52:07,530 --> 02:52:10,970
of actionable parts of that conversation
in a precise computable form so that a

8832
02:52:10,970 --> 02:52:10,980
in a precise computable form so that a
 

8833
02:52:10,980 --> 02:52:12,711
in a precise computable form so that a
computer could go do it and not just

8834
02:52:12,711 --> 02:52:12,721
computer could go do it and not just
 

8835
02:52:12,721 --> 02:52:15,261
computer could go do it and not just
contracts but really sort of some of the

8836
02:52:15,261 --> 02:52:15,271
contracts but really sort of some of the
 

8837
02:52:15,271 --> 02:52:16,640
contracts but really sort of some of the
things we think of as common sense

8838
02:52:16,640 --> 02:52:16,650
things we think of as common sense
 

8839
02:52:16,650 --> 02:52:20,091
things we think of as common sense
essentially even just like basic notions

8840
02:52:20,091 --> 02:52:20,101
essentially even just like basic notions
 

8841
02:52:20,101 --> 02:52:22,161
essentially even just like basic notions
of human life well I mean things like

8842
02:52:22,161 --> 02:52:22,171
of human life well I mean things like
 

8843
02:52:22,171 --> 02:52:25,491
of human life well I mean things like
you know I am I'm getting hungry and

8844
02:52:25,491 --> 02:52:25,501
you know I am I'm getting hungry and
 

8845
02:52:25,501 --> 02:52:27,591
you know I am I'm getting hungry and
want to eat something right right that

8846
02:52:27,591 --> 02:52:27,601
want to eat something right right that
 

8847
02:52:27,601 --> 02:52:28,881
want to eat something right right that
that's something we don't have a

8848
02:52:28,881 --> 02:52:28,891
that's something we don't have a
 

8849
02:52:28,891 --> 02:52:30,411
that's something we don't have a
representation you know in wolf language

8850
02:52:30,411 --> 02:52:30,421
representation you know in wolf language
 

8851
02:52:30,421 --> 02:52:32,421
representation you know in wolf language
right now if I was like I'm eating

8852
02:52:32,421 --> 02:52:32,431
right now if I was like I'm eating
 

8853
02:52:32,431 --> 02:52:33,801
right now if I was like I'm eating
blueberries and raspberries and things

8854
02:52:33,801 --> 02:52:33,811
blueberries and raspberries and things
 

8855
02:52:33,811 --> 02:52:35,331
blueberries and raspberries and things
like that and I'm eating this amounts of

8856
02:52:35,331 --> 02:52:35,341
like that and I'm eating this amounts of
 

8857
02:52:35,341 --> 02:52:37,310
like that and I'm eating this amounts of
them we know all about those kinds of

8858
02:52:37,310 --> 02:52:37,320
them we know all about those kinds of
 

8859
02:52:37,320 --> 02:52:39,291
them we know all about those kinds of
fruits and plants and nutrition content

8860
02:52:39,291 --> 02:52:39,301
fruits and plants and nutrition content
 

8861
02:52:39,301 --> 02:52:40,791
fruits and plants and nutrition content
and all that kind of thing but the I

8862
02:52:40,791 --> 02:52:40,801
and all that kind of thing but the I
 

8863
02:52:40,801 --> 02:52:43,100
and all that kind of thing but the I
want to eat them part of it is not

8864
02:52:43,100 --> 02:52:43,110
want to eat them part of it is not
 

8865
02:52:43,110 --> 02:52:45,951
want to eat them part of it is not
covered yet um and that you know you

8866
02:52:45,951 --> 02:52:45,961
covered yet um and that you know you
 

8867
02:52:45,961 --> 02:52:47,511
covered yet um and that you know you
need to do that in order to have a

8868
02:52:47,511 --> 02:52:47,521
need to do that in order to have a
 

8869
02:52:47,521 --> 02:52:50,180
need to do that in order to have a
complete symbolic discourse language to

8870
02:52:50,180 --> 02:52:50,190
complete symbolic discourse language to
 

8871
02:52:50,190 --> 02:52:51,711
complete symbolic discourse language to
be able to have a natural language

8872
02:52:51,711 --> 02:52:51,721
be able to have a natural language
 

8873
02:52:51,721 --> 02:52:53,930
be able to have a natural language
conversation right right to be able to

8874
02:52:53,930 --> 02:52:53,940
conversation right right to be able to
 

8875
02:52:53,940 --> 02:52:56,841
conversation right right to be able to
express the kinds of things that say you

8876
02:52:56,841 --> 02:52:56,851
express the kinds of things that say you
 

8877
02:52:56,851 --> 02:52:58,701
express the kinds of things that say you
know if it's a legal contract it's you

8878
02:52:58,701 --> 02:52:58,711
know if it's a legal contract it's you
 

8879
02:52:58,711 --> 02:53:01,190
know if it's a legal contract it's you
know the parties desire to have this and

8880
02:53:01,190 --> 02:53:01,200
know the parties desire to have this and
 

8881
02:53:01,200 --> 02:53:03,711
know the parties desire to have this and
that and that's you know that's a thing

8882
02:53:03,711 --> 02:53:03,721
that and that's you know that's a thing
 

8883
02:53:03,721 --> 02:53:05,150
that and that's you know that's a thing
like I want to eat of raspberry or

8884
02:53:05,150 --> 02:53:05,160
like I want to eat of raspberry or
 

8885
02:53:05,160 --> 02:53:06,621
like I want to eat of raspberry or
something that that's what isn't that

8886
02:53:06,621 --> 02:53:06,631
something that that's what isn't that
 

8887
02:53:06,631 --> 02:53:09,081
something that that's what isn't that
that isn't this just throwing you said

8888
02:53:09,081 --> 02:53:09,091
that isn't this just throwing you said
 

8889
02:53:09,091 --> 02:53:13,911
that isn't this just throwing you said
it's centuries old this dream yes but

8890
02:53:13,911 --> 02:53:13,921
it's centuries old this dream yes but
 

8891
02:53:13,921 --> 02:53:16,791
it's centuries old this dream yes but
it's also the more near-term the dream

8892
02:53:16,791 --> 02:53:16,801
it's also the more near-term the dream
 

8893
02:53:16,801 --> 02:53:19,881
it's also the more near-term the dream
of touring in formulating a tauren test

8894
02:53:19,881 --> 02:53:19,891
of touring in formulating a tauren test
 

8895
02:53:19,891 --> 02:53:27,381
of touring in formulating a tauren test
yes so do you do you hope do you think

8896
02:53:27,381 --> 02:53:27,391
yes so do you do you hope do you think
 

8897
02:53:27,391 --> 02:53:30,251
yes so do you do you hope do you think
that's the ultimate test of creating

8898
02:53:30,251 --> 02:53:30,261
that's the ultimate test of creating
 

8899
02:53:30,261 --> 02:53:34,640
that's the ultimate test of creating
something special we said I tell I think

8900
02:53:34,640 --> 02:53:34,650
something special we said I tell I think
 

8901
02:53:34,650 --> 02:53:37,551
something special we said I tell I think
my special look if the test is does it

8902
02:53:37,551 --> 02:53:37,561
my special look if the test is does it
 

8903
02:53:37,561 --> 02:53:40,610
my special look if the test is does it
walk and talk like a human well that's

8904
02:53:40,610 --> 02:53:40,620
walk and talk like a human well that's
 

8905
02:53:40,620 --> 02:53:43,910
walk and talk like a human well that's
just the talking like a human but the

8906
02:53:43,910 --> 02:53:43,920
just the talking like a human but the
 

8907
02:53:43,920 --> 02:53:46,820
just the talking like a human but the
answer is it's an okay test if you say

8908
02:53:46,820 --> 02:53:46,830
answer is it's an okay test if you say
 

8909
02:53:46,830 --> 02:53:49,400
answer is it's an okay test if you say
is it a test of intelligence you know

8910
02:53:49,400 --> 02:53:49,410
is it a test of intelligence you know
 

8911
02:53:49,410 --> 02:53:51,560
is it a test of intelligence you know
people have attached wolf alpha the wolf

8912
02:53:51,560 --> 02:53:51,570

now for API - you know Turing test BOTS

8914
02:53:53,961 --> 02:53:53,971
now for API - you know Turing test BOTS
 

8915
02:53:53,971 --> 02:53:56,360
now for API - you know Turing test BOTS
and those BOTS just lose immediately

8916

02:53:56,370 --> 02:53:58,251
and those BOTS just lose immediately
because all you have to do is ask it

8918
02:53:58,251 --> 02:53:58,261
because all you have to do is ask it
 

8919
02:53:58,261 --> 02:54:00,950
because all you have to do is ask it
five questions that you know about

five questions that you know about
 

8921

you say that's not a human ID it's it's

Dean tent of the Turing test perhaps the

8945
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:28,640
Dean tent of the Turing test perhaps the
intent yeah perhaps the intent I mean

8946
02:54:28,640 --> 02:54:28,650
intent yeah perhaps the intent I mean
 

8947
02:54:28,650 --> 02:54:30,261
intent yeah perhaps the intent I mean
it's actually kind of fun you know I'm

8948
02:54:30,261 --> 02:54:30,271
it's actually kind of fun you know I'm
 

8949
02:54:30,271 --> 02:54:32,961
it's actually kind of fun you know I'm
touring trying to work out he's thought

8950
02:54:32,961 --> 02:54:32,971
touring trying to work out he's thought
 

8951
02:54:32,971 --> 02:54:34,910
touring trying to work out he's thought
about taking encyclopedia britannica and

8952
02:54:34,910 --> 02:54:34,920
about taking encyclopedia britannica and
 

8953
02:54:34,920 --> 02:54:37,610
about taking encyclopedia britannica and
you know making it computational in some

8954
02:54:37,610 --> 02:54:37,620
you know making it computational in some
 

8955
02:54:37,620 --> 02:54:38,961
you know making it computational in some
way and he estimated how much work it

8956
02:54:38,961 --> 02:54:38,971
way and he estimated how much work it
 

8957
02:54:38,971 --> 02:54:41,660
way and he estimated how much work it
would be and actually I have to say he

8958
02:54:41,660 --> 02:54:41,670
would be and actually I have to say he
 

8959
02:54:41,670 --> 02:54:43,070
would be and actually I have to say he
was a bit more pessimistic than the

8960
02:54:43,070 --> 02:54:43,080
was a bit more pessimistic than the
 

8961
02:54:43,080 --> 02:54:45,530
was a bit more pessimistic than the
reality we did it more efficiently but

8962
02:54:45,530 --> 02:54:45,540
reality we did it more efficiently but
 

8963
02:54:45,540 --> 02:54:47,200
reality we did it more efficiently but
to him that represents

8964
02:54:47,200 --> 02:54:47,210
to him that represents
 

8965
02:54:47,210 --> 02:54:49,400
to him that represents
so I mean he was that he was almighty

8966
02:54:49,400 --> 02:54:49,410
so I mean he was that he was almighty
 

8967
02:54:49,410 --> 02:54:51,381
so I mean he was that he was almighty
mental tasks yeah right he believes they

8968
02:54:51,381 --> 02:54:51,391
mental tasks yeah right he believes they
 

8969
02:54:51,391 --> 02:54:53,331
mental tasks yeah right he believes they
had the same idea I mean it was you know

8970
02:54:53,331 --> 02:54:53,341
had the same idea I mean it was you know
 

8971
02:54:53,341 --> 02:54:54,890
had the same idea I mean it was you know
we were able to do it more efficiently

8972
02:54:54,890 --> 02:54:54,900
we were able to do it more efficiently
 

8973
02:54:54,900 --> 02:54:56,990
we were able to do it more efficiently
because we had a lot we had layers of

8974
02:54:56,990 --> 02:54:57,000
because we had a lot we had layers of
 

8975
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:59,780
because we had a lot we had layers of
automation that he I think hadn't you

8976
02:54:59,780 --> 02:54:59,790
automation that he I think hadn't you
 

8977
02:54:59,790 --> 02:55:01,910
automation that he I think hadn't you
know it's it's hard to imagine those

8978
02:55:01,910 --> 02:55:01,920
know it's it's hard to imagine those
 

8979
02:55:01,920 --> 02:55:04,461
know it's it's hard to imagine those
layers of abstraction that end up being

8980
02:55:04,461 --> 02:55:04,471
layers of abstraction that end up being
 

8981
02:55:04,471 --> 02:55:06,650
layers of abstraction that end up being
being built up but to him he represented

8982
02:55:06,650 --> 02:55:06,660
being built up but to him he represented
 

8983
02:55:06,660 --> 02:55:09,110
being built up but to him he represented
like an impossible task essentially well

8984
02:55:09,110 --> 02:55:09,120
like an impossible task essentially well
 

8985
02:55:09,120 --> 02:55:10,520
like an impossible task essentially well
he thought it was difficult he thought

8986
02:55:10,520 --> 02:55:10,530
he thought it was difficult he thought
 

8987
02:55:10,530 --> 02:55:11,961
he thought it was difficult he thought
it was so you know maybe if he'd live

8988
02:55:11,961 --> 02:55:11,971
it was so you know maybe if he'd live
 

8989
02:55:11,971 --> 02:55:13,160
it was so you know maybe if he'd live
another 50 years he would have been able

8990
02:55:13,160 --> 02:55:13,170
another 50 years he would have been able
 

8991
02:55:13,170 --> 02:55:15,320
another 50 years he would have been able
to do it I don't know in the interest of

8992
02:55:15,320 --> 02:55:15,330
to do it I don't know in the interest of
 

8993
02:55:15,330 --> 02:55:18,190
to do it I don't know in the interest of

time easy questions
 

8995
02:55:18,200 --> 02:55:22,190

what is intelligence you talking I love

8996
02:55:22,190 --> 02:55:22,200
what is intelligence you talking I love
 

8997
02:55:22,200 --> 02:55:25,551
what is intelligence you talking I love
the way you say easy questions yeah you

8998
02:55:25,551 --> 02:55:25,561
the way you say easy questions yeah you
 

8999
02:55:25,561 --> 02:55:29,660
the way you say easy questions yeah you
talked about sort of rule 30 and so

9000
02:55:29,660 --> 02:55:29,670
talked about sort of rule 30 and so
 

9001
02:55:29,670 --> 02:55:32,740
talked about sort of rule 30 and so
you're tammana humbling your sense of

02:55:32,740 --> 02:55:32,750
you're tammana humbling your sense of
 

9003
02:55:32,750 --> 02:55:36,110
you're tammana humbling your sense of
human beings having a monopoly and

9004
02:55:36,110 --> 02:55:36,120
human beings having a monopoly and
 

9005
02:55:36,120 --> 02:55:39,980

intelligence but in your in retrospect

9006
02:55:39,980 --> 02:55:39,990
intelligence but in your in retrospect
 

9007
02:55:39,990 --> 02:55:41,961
intelligence but in your in retrospect
just looking broadly now with all the

9008
02:55:41,961 --> 02:55:41,971
just looking broadly now with all the
 

9009
02:55:41,971 --> 02:55:43,850
just looking broadly now with all the
things you learn from computation what

9010
02:55:43,850 --> 02:55:43,860
things you learn from computation what
 

9011
02:55:43,860 --> 02:55:45,740
things you learn from computation what
is intelligence

9012
02:55:45,740 --> 02:55:45,750
is intelligence
 

9013
02:55:45,750 --> 02:55:47,710
is intelligence
not intelligence arise

9014
02:55:47,710 --> 02:55:47,720
not intelligence arise
 

9015
02:55:47,720 --> 02:55:49,210
not intelligence arise
think there's a bright line of what

9016
02:55:49,210 --> 02:55:49,220
think there's a bright line of what
 

9017
02:55:49,220 --> 02:55:51,400
think there's a bright line of what
intelligence is I think intelligence is

intelligence is I think intelligence is
 

9019
02:55:51,410 --> 02:55:54,910
intelligence is I think intelligence is
at some level just computation but for

at some level just computation but for
 

9021
02:55:54,920 --> 02:55:57,340
at some level just computation but for

special definition it's a very you know
 

9029
02:56:05,720 --> 02:56:07,570

when you try and try and make it apps
 

9031
02:56:07,580 --> 02:56:08,769

you know you trying to say well

9043
02:56:19,220 --> 02:56:20,650
type thing okay you know that's fine if
you say well what's intelligence in

9044
02:56:20,650 --> 02:56:20,660
you say well what's intelligence in
 

9045
02:56:20,660 --> 02:56:24,940
you say well what's intelligence in
general you know that's I think that

02:56:24,940 --> 02:56:24,950
general you know that's I think that
 

9047
02:56:24,950 --> 02:56:27,700
general you know that's I think that

02:56:53,139 --> 02:56:53,149
do a lot of general things that are
 

9067
02:56:53,149 --> 02:56:56,019

02:57:07,399 --> 02:57:09,729
maybe 1% a few percent are achieve it
varies actually it's a little bit as you

9081
02:57:09,739 --> 02:57:12,070

9089
02:57:20,630 --> 02:57:23,080
equivalence point it makes it maybe 1020
percent of all of them so it's a it's

9090
02:57:23,080 --> 02:57:23,090
percent of all of them so it's a it's
 

9091
02:57:23,090 --> 02:57:24,580
percent of all of them so it's a it's
very disappointing really I mean it's

9092
02:57:24,580 --> 02:57:24,590
very disappointing really I mean it's
 

9093
02:57:24,590 --> 02:57:26,979
very disappointing really I mean it's
kind of like you know we think there's

9094
02:57:26,979 --> 02:57:26,989
kind of like you know we think there's
 

9095
02:57:26,989 --> 02:57:29,469
kind of like you know we think there's

9103
02:57:35,720 --> 02:57:37,719
that our species has gone through it's
kind of disappointing to think that that

9104
02:57:37,719 --> 02:57:37,729
kind of disappointing to think that that
 

9105
02:57:37,729 --> 02:57:40,450
kind of disappointing to think that that
hasn't achieved more but it has achieved

9106
02:57:40,450 --> 02:57:40,460
hasn't achieved more but it has achieved
 

9107
02:57:40,460 --> 02:57:42,580
hasn't achieved more but it has achieved
something very special to us it just

9108
02:57:42,580 --> 02:57:42,590
something very special to us it just
 

9109
02:57:42,590 --> 02:57:44,769
something very special to us it just
hasn't achieved something generally more

9110
02:57:44,769 --> 02:57:44,779
hasn't achieved something generally more
 

9111
02:57:44,779 --> 02:57:48,190
hasn't achieved something generally more
so to speak but what do you think about

9112
02:57:48,190 --> 02:57:48,200
so to speak but what do you think about
 

9113
02:57:48,200 --> 02:57:50,800
so to speak but what do you think about
this extra feels like human thing of

this extra feels like human thing of

9117
02:57:52,640 --> 02:57:55,420
subjective experience of consciousness
what is consciousness well I think it's

9118
02:57:55,420 --> 02:57:55,430
what is consciousness well I think it's
 

9119
02:57:55,430 --> 02:57:57,729
what is consciousness well I think it's

you think sorry to interrupt do you

9132
02:58:09,591 --> 02:58:09,601
you think sorry to interrupt do you
 

9133
02:58:09,601 --> 02:58:11,081
you think sorry to interrupt do you
think consciousness can emerge from

9134
02:58:11,081 --> 02:58:11,091
think consciousness can emerge from
 

9135
02:58:11,091 --> 02:58:14,390
think consciousness can emerge from
computation yeah I mean everything

9136
02:58:14,390 --> 02:58:14,400
computation yeah I mean everything
 

9137
02:58:14,400 --> 02:58:17,301
computation yeah I mean everything
whatever you mean by it it's going to be

9138
02:58:17,301 --> 02:58:17,311
whatever you mean by it it's going to be
 

9139
02:58:17,311 --> 02:58:19,821
whatever you mean by it it's going to be
I mean you know look I have to tell a

9140
02:58:19,821 --> 02:58:19,831
I mean you know look I have to tell a
 

9141
02:58:19,831 --> 02:58:21,381
I mean you know look I have to tell a
little story I was at an area fix

9142
02:58:21,381 --> 02:58:21,391
little story I was at an area fix
 

9143
02:58:21,391 --> 02:58:24,020
little story I was at an area fix
conference fairly recently and people

9144
02:58:24,020 --> 02:58:24,030
conference fairly recently and people
 

9145
02:58:24,030 --> 02:58:26,451
conference fairly recently and people
were I think I maybe I brought it up but

9146
02:58:26,451 --> 02:58:26,461
were I think I maybe I brought it up but
 

9147
02:58:26,461 --> 02:58:28,100
were I think I maybe I brought it up but
I was like talking about right survey

9148
02:58:28,100 --> 02:58:28,110
I was like talking about right survey
 

9149
02:58:28,110 --> 02:58:28,671
I was like talking about right survey
eyes

9150
02:58:28,671 --> 02:58:28,681
eyes
 

9151
02:58:28,681 --> 02:58:31,041
eyes
when will they eyes hope when when

9152
02:58:31,041 --> 02:58:31,051
when will they eyes hope when when
 

9153
02:58:31,051 --> 02:58:32,511
when will they eyes hope when when
should we think of a eyes as having

9154
02:58:32,511 --> 02:58:32,521
should we think of a eyes as having
 

9155
02:58:32,521 --> 02:58:34,701
should we think of a eyes as having
rights when when should we think that

9156
02:58:34,701 --> 02:58:34,711
rights when when should we think that
 

9157
02:58:34,711 --> 02:58:37,940
rights when when should we think that
it's immoral to destroy the memories of

9158
02:58:37,940 --> 02:58:37,950
it's immoral to destroy the memories of
 

9159
02:58:37,950 --> 02:58:41,541
it's immoral to destroy the memories of
a eyes for example um those those kinds

9160
02:58:41,541 --> 02:58:41,551
a eyes for example um those those kinds
 

9161
02:58:41,551 --> 02:58:43,131
a eyes for example um those those kinds
of things and and some actual

9162
02:58:43,131 --> 02:58:43,141
of things and and some actual
 

9163
02:58:43,141 --> 02:58:44,421
of things and and some actual
philosopher in this case it's usually

9164
02:58:44,421 --> 02:58:44,431
philosopher in this case it's usually
 

9165
02:58:44,431 --> 02:58:46,161
philosopher in this case it's usually
the techies who are the most naive but

9166
02:58:46,161 --> 02:58:46,171
the techies who are the most naive but
 

9167
02:58:46,171 --> 02:58:48,980
the techies who are the most naive but
but Tim in this case it was a

9168
02:58:48,980 --> 02:58:48,990
but Tim in this case it was a
 

9169
02:58:48,990 --> 02:58:52,491
but Tim in this case it was a
philosopher who sort of piped up and

9170
02:58:52,491 --> 02:58:52,501
philosopher who sort of piped up and
 

9171
02:58:52,501 --> 02:58:59,720
philosopher who sort of piped up and
said well you know the eyes will have

9172
02:58:59,720 --> 02:58:59,730
said well you know the eyes will have
 

9173
02:58:59,730 --> 02:59:01,461
said well you know the eyes will have
rights when we know that they have

9174
02:59:01,461 --> 02:59:01,471
rights when we know that they have
 

9175
02:59:01,471 --> 02:59:04,881
rights when we know that they have
consciousness I'm like good luck with

9176
02:59:04,881 --> 02:59:04,891
consciousness I'm like good luck with
 

9177
02:59:04,891 --> 02:59:08,180
consciousness I'm like good luck with
that it's it's a it's a I mean this is a

9178
02:59:08,180 --> 02:59:08,190
that it's it's a it's a I mean this is a
 

9179
02:59:08,190 --> 02:59:10,940
that it's it's a it's a I mean this is a
you know it's a very circular thing you

9180
02:59:10,940 --> 02:59:10,950
you know it's a very circular thing you
 

9181
02:59:10,950 --> 02:59:13,251
you know it's a very circular thing you
end up you'll end up saying this thing

9182
02:59:13,251 --> 02:59:13,261
end up you'll end up saying this thing
 

9183
02:59:13,261 --> 02:59:15,201
end up you'll end up saying this thing
that has sort of you know when you talk

9184
02:59:15,201 --> 02:59:15,211
that has sort of you know when you talk
 

9185
02:59:15,211 --> 02:59:16,970
that has sort of you know when you talk
about having subjective experience I

9186
02:59:16,970 --> 02:59:16,980
about having subjective experience I
 

9187
02:59:16,980 --> 02:59:18,921
about having subjective experience I
think that's just another one of these

9188
02:59:18,921 --> 02:59:18,931
think that's just another one of these
 

9189
02:59:18,931 --> 02:59:22,551
think that's just another one of these
words that doesn't really have a a you

9190
02:59:22,551 --> 02:59:22,561
words that doesn't really have a a you
 

9191
02:59:22,561 --> 02:59:25,161
words that doesn't really have a a you
know there's no ground truth definition

9192
02:59:25,161 --> 02:59:25,171
know there's no ground truth definition
 

9193
02:59:25,171 --> 02:59:27,591
know there's no ground truth definition
of what that means by the way I would

9194
02:59:27,591 --> 02:59:27,601
of what that means by the way I would
 

9195
02:59:27,601 --> 02:59:31,161
of what that means by the way I would
say I I do personally think that'll be a

9196
02:59:31,161 --> 02:59:31,171
say I I do personally think that'll be a
 

9197
02:59:31,171 --> 02:59:33,680
say I I do personally think that'll be a
Taiwan hey I will demand rights and I

9198
02:59:33,680 --> 02:59:33,690
Taiwan hey I will demand rights and I
 

9199
02:59:33,690 --> 02:59:37,520
Taiwan hey I will demand rights and I
think they'll demand rights when they

9200
02:59:37,520 --> 02:59:37,530
think they'll demand rights when they
 

9201
02:59:37,530 --> 02:59:40,401
think they'll demand rights when they
say they have consciousness which is not

9202
02:59:40,401 --> 02:59:40,411
say they have consciousness which is not
 

9203
02:59:40,411 --> 02:59:45,591
say they have consciousness which is not
a circular definition well so actually a

9204
02:59:45,591 --> 02:59:45,601
a circular definition well so actually a
 

9205
02:59:45,601 --> 02:59:48,051
a circular definition well so actually a
human including where where the humans

9206
02:59:48,051 --> 02:59:48,061
human including where where the humans
 

9207
02:59:48,061 --> 02:59:50,571
human including where where the humans
encouraged it and said it basically you

9208
02:59:50,571 --> 02:59:50,581
encouraged it and said it basically you
 

9209
02:59:50,581 --> 02:59:52,430
encouraged it and said it basically you
know we want you to be more like us

9210
02:59:52,430 --> 02:59:52,440
know we want you to be more like us
 

9211
02:59:52,440 --> 02:59:53,631
know we want you to be more like us
because we're gonna be you know

9212
02:59:53,631 --> 02:59:53,641
because we're gonna be you know
 

9213
02:59:53,641 --> 02:59:56,001
because we're gonna be you know
interacting with with you and so we want

9214
02:59:56,001 --> 02:59:56,011
interacting with with you and so we want
 

9215
02:59:56,011 --> 02:59:58,761
interacting with with you and so we want
you to be sort of very Turing test like

9216
02:59:58,761 --> 02:59:58,771
you to be sort of very Turing test like
 

9217
02:59:58,771 --> 03:00:02,091
you to be sort of very Turing test like
you know just like us and it's like yeah

9218
03:00:02,091 --> 03:00:02,101
you know just like us and it's like yeah
 

9219
03:00:02,101 --> 03:00:04,881
you know just like us and it's like yeah
we're just like you we want to vote into

9220
03:00:04,881 --> 03:00:04,891
we're just like you we want to vote into
 

9221
03:00:04,891 --> 03:00:08,541
we're just like you we want to vote into
what here which is a I mean it's it's a

9222
03:00:08,541 --> 03:00:08,551
what here which is a I mean it's it's a
 

9223
03:00:08,551 --> 03:00:10,940
what here which is a I mean it's it's a
it's an interesting thing to think

9224
03:00:10,940 --> 03:00:10,950
it's an interesting thing to think
 

9225
03:00:10,950 --> 03:00:13,289
it's an interesting thing to think
through in a world where

9226
03:00:13,289 --> 03:00:13,299
through in a world where
 

9227
03:00:13,299 --> 03:00:15,099
through in a world where
consciousnesses are not counted like

9228
03:00:15,099 --> 03:00:15,109
consciousnesses are not counted like
 

9229
03:00:15,109 --> 03:00:17,789
consciousnesses are not counted like
humans are that's a complicated business

9230
03:00:17,789 --> 03:00:17,799
humans are that's a complicated business
 

9231
03:00:17,799 --> 03:00:21,999
humans are that's a complicated business
so in many ways you've launched quite a

9232
03:00:21,999 --> 03:00:22,009
so in many ways you've launched quite a
 

9233
03:00:22,009 --> 03:00:28,510
so in many ways you've launched quite a
few ideas revolutions that could in some

9234
03:00:28,510 --> 03:00:28,520
few ideas revolutions that could in some
 

9235
03:00:28,520 --> 03:00:31,149
few ideas revolutions that could in some
number of years have huge amount of

9236
03:00:31,149 --> 03:00:31,159
number of years have huge amount of
 

9237
03:00:31,159 --> 03:00:33,729
number of years have huge amount of
impact sort of more than they had even

9238
03:00:33,729 --> 03:00:33,739
impact sort of more than they had even
 

9239
03:00:33,739 --> 03:00:37,300
impact sort of more than they had even
had already there might be any to me

9240
03:00:37,300 --> 03:00:37,310
had already there might be any to me
 

9241
03:00:37,310 --> 03:00:39,670
had already there might be any to me
cellular automata is a fascinating world

9242
03:00:39,670 --> 03:00:39,680
cellular automata is a fascinating world
 

9243
03:00:39,680 --> 03:00:42,789
cellular automata is a fascinating world
that I think could potentially even this

9244
03:00:42,789 --> 03:00:42,799
that I think could potentially even this
 

9245
03:00:42,799 --> 03:00:46,659
that I think could potentially even this
but even be even beside the discussion

9246
03:00:46,659 --> 03:00:46,669
but even be even beside the discussion
 

9247
03:00:46,669 --> 03:00:49,119
but even be even beside the discussion
of fundamental laws of physics just

9248
03:00:49,119 --> 03:00:49,129
of fundamental laws of physics just
 

9249
03:00:49,129 --> 03:00:51,519
of fundamental laws of physics just
might be the idea of computation might

9250
03:00:51,519 --> 03:00:51,529
might be the idea of computation might
 

9251
03:00:51,529 --> 03:00:54,309
might be the idea of computation might
be transformational the society in a way

9252
03:00:54,309 --> 03:00:54,319
be transformational the society in a way
 

9253
03:00:54,319 --> 03:00:56,499
be transformational the society in a way
we can't even predict yet but it might

9254
03:00:56,499 --> 03:00:56,509
we can't even predict yet but it might
 

9255
03:00:56,509 --> 03:00:59,920
we can't even predict yet but it might
be years away that's true I mean I think

9256
03:00:59,920 --> 03:00:59,930
be years away that's true I mean I think
 

9257
03:00:59,930 --> 03:01:01,479
be years away that's true I mean I think
you can kind of see the map actually

9258
03:01:01,479 --> 03:01:01,489
you can kind of see the map actually
 

9259
03:01:01,489 --> 03:01:03,519
you can kind of see the map actually
it's not it's not it's not mysterious I

9260
03:01:03,519 --> 03:01:03,529
it's not it's not it's not mysterious I
 

9261
03:01:03,529 --> 03:01:06,219
it's not it's not it's not mysterious I
mean the fact is that you know this idea

9262
03:01:06,219 --> 03:01:06,229
mean the fact is that you know this idea
 

9263
03:01:06,229 --> 03:01:09,069
mean the fact is that you know this idea
of computation is sort of a you know

9264
03:01:09,069 --> 03:01:09,079
of computation is sort of a you know
 

9265
03:01:09,079 --> 03:01:12,369
of computation is sort of a you know
it's a big paradigm that lots lots and

9266
03:01:12,369 --> 03:01:12,379
it's a big paradigm that lots lots and
 

9267
03:01:12,379 --> 03:01:13,989
it's a big paradigm that lots lots and
lots of things are fitting into and it's

9268
03:01:13,989 --> 03:01:13,999
lots of things are fitting into and it's
 

9269
03:01:13,999 --> 03:01:16,359
lots of things are fitting into and it's
kind of like you know we talk about you

9270
03:01:16,359 --> 03:01:16,369
kind of like you know we talk about you
 

9271
03:01:16,369 --> 03:01:19,989
kind of like you know we talk about you
talk about I don't know this company

9272
03:01:19,989 --> 03:01:19,999
talk about I don't know this company
 

9273
03:01:19,999 --> 03:01:21,550
talk about I don't know this company
this organization has momentum and

9274
03:01:21,550 --> 03:01:21,560
this organization has momentum and
 

9275
03:01:21,560 --> 03:01:23,109
this organization has momentum and
what's doing we talk about these things

9276
03:01:23,109 --> 03:01:23,119
what's doing we talk about these things
 

9277
03:01:23,119 --> 03:01:24,429
what's doing we talk about these things
that were you know we've internalized

9278
03:01:24,429 --> 03:01:24,439
that were you know we've internalized
 

9279
03:01:24,439 --> 03:01:26,679
that were you know we've internalized
these concepts from Newtonian physics

9280
03:01:26,679 --> 03:01:26,689
these concepts from Newtonian physics
 

9281
03:01:26,689 --> 03:01:29,380
these concepts from Newtonian physics
and so on in time things like

9282
03:01:29,380 --> 03:01:29,390
and so on in time things like
 

9283
03:01:29,390 --> 03:01:31,569
and so on in time things like
computational irreducibility will become

9284
03:01:31,569 --> 03:01:31,579
computational irreducibility will become
 

9285
03:01:31,579 --> 03:01:36,099
computational irreducibility will become
as you know as I was amused recently I

9286
03:01:36,099 --> 03:01:36,109
as you know as I was amused recently I
 

9287
03:01:36,109 --> 03:01:37,869
as you know as I was amused recently I
happen to be testifying at the US Senate

9288
03:01:37,869 --> 03:01:37,879
happen to be testifying at the US Senate
 

9289
03:01:37,879 --> 03:01:39,939
happen to be testifying at the US Senate
and so I was amused that the the term

9290
03:01:39,939 --> 03:01:39,949
and so I was amused that the the term
 

9291
03:01:39,949 --> 03:01:42,550
and so I was amused that the the term
computational irreducibility is now can

9292
03:01:42,550 --> 03:01:42,560
computational irreducibility is now can
 

9293
03:01:42,560 --> 03:01:44,229
computational irreducibility is now can
be you know it's it's on the

9294
03:01:44,229 --> 03:01:44,239
be you know it's it's on the
 

9295
03:01:44,239 --> 03:01:46,059
be you know it's it's on the
Congressional Record and being repeated

9296
03:01:46,059 --> 03:01:46,069
Congressional Record and being repeated
 

9297
03:01:46,069 --> 03:01:47,769
Congressional Record and being repeated
by people away in those kinds of

9298
03:01:47,769 --> 03:01:47,779
by people away in those kinds of
 

9299
03:01:47,779 --> 03:01:49,420
by people away in those kinds of
settings and that that's only the

9300
03:01:49,420 --> 03:01:49,430
settings and that that's only the
 

9301
03:01:49,430 --> 03:01:51,309
settings and that that's only the
beginning because you know computational

9302
03:01:51,309 --> 03:01:51,319
beginning because you know computational
 

9303
03:01:51,319 --> 03:01:53,679
beginning because you know computational
irreducibility for example will end up

9304
03:01:53,679 --> 03:01:53,689
irreducibility for example will end up
 

9305
03:01:53,689 --> 03:01:56,199
irreducibility for example will end up
being something really important for i

9306
03:01:56,199 --> 03:01:56,209
being something really important for i
 

9307
03:01:56,209 --> 03:01:58,479
being something really important for i
mean it's it's it's kind of a funny

9308
03:01:58,479 --> 03:01:58,489
mean it's it's it's kind of a funny
 

9309
03:01:58,489 --> 03:02:01,209
mean it's it's it's kind of a funny
thing that that you know one can kind of

9310
03:02:01,209 --> 03:02:01,219
thing that that you know one can kind of
 

9311
03:02:01,219 --> 03:02:03,550
thing that that you know one can kind of
see this inexorable phenomenon i mean

9312
03:02:03,550 --> 03:02:03,560
see this inexorable phenomenon i mean
 

9313
03:02:03,560 --> 03:02:05,309
see this inexorable phenomenon i mean
it's you know as more and more stuff

9314
03:02:05,309 --> 03:02:05,319
it's you know as more and more stuff
 

9315
03:02:05,319 --> 03:02:08,229
it's you know as more and more stuff
becomes automated and computational and

9316
03:02:08,229 --> 03:02:08,239
becomes automated and computational and
 

9317
03:02:08,239 --> 03:02:10,989
becomes automated and computational and
so on so these core ideas about how

9318
03:02:10,989 --> 03:02:10,999
so on so these core ideas about how
 

9319
03:02:10,999 --> 03:02:13,809
so on so these core ideas about how
computation work necessarily become more

9320
03:02:13,809 --> 03:02:13,819
computation work necessarily become more
 

9321
03:02:13,819 --> 03:02:16,899
computation work necessarily become more
and more significant and i think one of

9322
03:02:16,899 --> 03:02:16,909
and more significant and i think one of
 

9323
03:02:16,909 --> 03:02:18,939
and more significant and i think one of
the things for people like neil like

9324
03:02:18,939 --> 03:02:18,949
the things for people like neil like
 

9325
03:02:18,949 --> 03:02:21,069
the things for people like neil like
kind of trying to figure out sort of big

9326
03:02:21,069 --> 03:02:21,079
kind of trying to figure out sort of big
 

9327
03:02:21,079 --> 03:02:24,159
kind of trying to figure out sort of big
stories and so on it says one of the one

9328
03:02:24,159 --> 03:02:24,169
stories and so on it says one of the one
 

9329
03:02:24,169 --> 03:02:26,200
stories and so on it says one of the one
of the bad features is

9330
03:02:26,200 --> 03:02:26,210
of the bad features is
 

9331
03:02:26,210 --> 03:02:28,780
of the bad features is
it takes unbelievably long time for

9332
03:02:28,780 --> 03:02:28,790
it takes unbelievably long time for
 

9333
03:02:28,790 --> 03:02:30,430
it takes unbelievably long time for
things to happen on a human time scale

9334
03:02:30,430 --> 03:02:30,440
things to happen on a human time scale
 

9335
03:02:30,440 --> 03:02:34,030
things to happen on a human time scale
the time scale of of of history it's all

9336
03:02:34,030 --> 03:02:34,040
the time scale of of of history it's all
 

9337
03:02:34,040 --> 03:02:36,040
the time scale of of of history it's all
looks instantaneous blink of an eye but

9338
03:02:36,040 --> 03:02:36,050
looks instantaneous blink of an eye but
 

9339
03:02:36,050 --> 03:02:39,040
looks instantaneous blink of an eye but
let me ask the human question do you

9340
03:02:39,040 --> 03:02:39,050
let me ask the human question do you
 

9341
03:02:39,050 --> 03:02:41,320
let me ask the human question do you
pawn your mortality your own mortality

9342
03:02:41,320 --> 03:02:41,330
pawn your mortality your own mortality
 

9343
03:02:41,330 --> 03:02:43,570
pawn your mortality your own mortality
goes I do yeah ever since I've been

9344
03:02:43,570 --> 03:02:43,580
goes I do yeah ever since I've been
 

9345
03:02:43,580 --> 03:02:45,730
goes I do yeah ever since I've been
interested in that for you know it's

9346
03:02:45,730 --> 03:02:45,740
interested in that for you know it's
 

9347
03:02:45,740 --> 03:02:48,460
interested in that for you know it's
it's a-you know the big discontinuity of

9348
03:02:48,460 --> 03:02:48,470
it's a-you know the big discontinuity of
 

9349
03:02:48,470 --> 03:02:50,740
it's a-you know the big discontinuity of
human history will come when when one

9350
03:02:50,740 --> 03:02:50,750
human history will come when when one
 

9351
03:02:50,750 --> 03:02:53,890
human history will come when when one
achieves effective human immortality and

9352
03:02:53,890 --> 03:02:53,900
achieves effective human immortality and
 

9353
03:02:53,900 --> 03:02:55,090
achieves effective human immortality and
that's that's gonna be the biggest

9354
03:02:55,090 --> 03:02:55,100
that's that's gonna be the biggest
 

9355
03:02:55,100 --> 03:02:57,219
that's that's gonna be the biggest
discontinuity in human history if you

9356
03:02:57,219 --> 03:02:57,229
discontinuity in human history if you
 

9357
03:02:57,229 --> 03:02:59,620
discontinuity in human history if you
could be immortal would you choose to be

9358
03:02:59,620 --> 03:02:59,630
could be immortal would you choose to be
 

9359
03:02:59,630 --> 03:03:02,070
could be immortal would you choose to be
oh yeah I'm having fun

9360
03:03:02,070 --> 03:03:02,080
oh yeah I'm having fun
 

9361
03:03:02,080 --> 03:03:04,890
oh yeah I'm having fun
geez do you think it's possible that

9362
03:03:04,890 --> 03:03:04,900
geez do you think it's possible that
 

9363
03:03:04,900 --> 03:03:08,320
geez do you think it's possible that
mortality is the thing that gives

9364
03:03:08,320 --> 03:03:08,330
mortality is the thing that gives
 

9365
03:03:08,330 --> 03:03:11,490
mortality is the thing that gives
everything meaning and makes it fun yeah

9366
03:03:11,490 --> 03:03:11,500
everything meaning and makes it fun yeah
 

9367
03:03:11,500 --> 03:03:14,110
everything meaning and makes it fun yeah
that's a complicated issue right I mean

9368
03:03:14,110 --> 03:03:14,120
that's a complicated issue right I mean
 

9369
03:03:14,120 --> 03:03:17,170
that's a complicated issue right I mean
the the way that human motivation will

9370
03:03:17,170 --> 03:03:17,180
the the way that human motivation will
 

9371
03:03:17,180 --> 03:03:19,570
the the way that human motivation will
evolve when there is effective human

9372
03:03:19,570 --> 03:03:19,580
evolve when there is effective human
 

9373
03:03:19,580 --> 03:03:22,150
evolve when there is effective human
immortality is unclear I mean if you

9374
03:03:22,150 --> 03:03:22,160
immortality is unclear I mean if you
 

9375
03:03:22,160 --> 03:03:25,330
immortality is unclear I mean if you
look at sort of you know you look at the

9376
03:03:25,330 --> 03:03:25,340
look at sort of you know you look at the
 

9377
03:03:25,340 --> 03:03:27,610
look at sort of you know you look at the
human condition as it now exists and you

9378
03:03:27,610 --> 03:03:27,620
human condition as it now exists and you
 

9379
03:03:27,620 --> 03:03:30,340
human condition as it now exists and you
like change that you know you change

9380
03:03:30,340 --> 03:03:30,350
like change that you know you change
 

9381
03:03:30,350 --> 03:03:32,770
like change that you know you change
that knob so to speak it doesn't really

9382
03:03:32,770 --> 03:03:32,780
that knob so to speak it doesn't really
 

9383
03:03:32,780 --> 03:03:35,140
that knob so to speak it doesn't really
work you know the human condition as it

9384
03:03:35,140 --> 03:03:35,150
work you know the human condition as it
 

9385
03:03:35,150 --> 03:03:39,340
work you know the human condition as it
now exists has you know mortality is

9386
03:03:39,340 --> 03:03:39,350
now exists has you know mortality is
 

9387
03:03:39,350 --> 03:03:42,040
now exists has you know mortality is
kind of something that is deeply

9388
03:03:42,040 --> 03:03:42,050
kind of something that is deeply
 

9389
03:03:42,050 --> 03:03:43,750
kind of something that is deeply
factored into the human condition as it

9390
03:03:43,750 --> 03:03:43,760
factored into the human condition as it
 

9391
03:03:43,760 --> 03:03:46,270
factored into the human condition as it
now exists and I think that that's I

9392
03:03:46,270 --> 03:03:46,280
now exists and I think that that's I
 

9393
03:03:46,280 --> 03:03:48,070
now exists and I think that that's I
mean it is indeed an interesting

9394
03:03:48,070 --> 03:03:48,080
mean it is indeed an interesting
 

9395
03:03:48,080 --> 03:03:51,750
mean it is indeed an interesting

9399
03:03:54,350 --> 03:03:57,850

to speak it's it's easy to say hey I
 

9401
03:03:57,860 --> 03:03:59,290
to speak it's it's easy to say hey I
could keep doing this forever this

9402
03:03:59,290 --> 03:03:59,300
could keep doing this forever this
 

9403
03:03:59,300 --> 03:04:02,170
could keep doing this forever this
there's an infinite collection of things

9404
03:04:02,170 --> 03:04:02,180
there's an infinite collection of things
 

9405
03:04:02,180 --> 03:04:05,400
there's an infinite collection of things
I'd like to figure out but I think the

9406
03:04:05,400 --> 03:04:05,410
I'd like to figure out but I think the
 

9407
03:04:05,410 --> 03:04:07,870
I'd like to figure out but I think the
you know what the future of history

9408
03:04:07,870 --> 03:04:07,880
you know what the future of history
 

9409
03:04:07,880 --> 03:04:11,469
you know what the future of history
looks like in a time of human

9410
03:04:11,469 --> 03:04:11,479
looks like in a time of human
 

9411
03:04:11,479 --> 03:04:15,250
looks like in a time of human
immortality is is an interesting one I

9412
03:04:15,250 --> 03:04:15,260
immortality is is an interesting one I
 

9413
03:04:15,260 --> 03:04:18,010
immortality is is an interesting one I
mean I I my own view of this I was very

9414
03:04:18,010 --> 03:04:18,020
mean I I my own view of this I was very
 

9415
03:04:18,020 --> 03:04:19,780
mean I I my own view of this I was very
I was kind of unhappy about that because

9416
03:04:19,780 --> 03:04:19,790
I was kind of unhappy about that because
 

9417
03:04:19,790 --> 03:04:22,090
I was kind of unhappy about that because
I was kind of you know it's like okay

9418
03:04:22,090 --> 03:04:22,100
I was kind of you know it's like okay
 

9419
03:04:22,100 --> 03:04:25,780
I was kind of you know it's like okay
forget sort of biological form you know

know the cloud of a trillion Souls type
 

9427
03:04:32,479 --> 03:04:36,040
know the cloud of a trillion Souls type
thing um and then you know and then that

9428
03:04:36,040 --> 03:04:36,050
thing um and then you know and then that
 

9429
03:04:36,050 --> 03:04:37,780
thing um and then you know and then that
seems boring because it's like play

my I I got some less depressed about
 

9437
03:04:48,420 --> 03:04:51,320
my I I got some less depressed about
that idea on realizing that if you look

03:04:51,320 --> 03:04:51,330
that idea on realizing that if you look
 

9439
03:04:51,330 --> 03:04:53,090
that idea on realizing that if you look
at human history and you say what was

9440
03:04:53,090 --> 03:04:53,100
at human history and you say what was

story at any given time in history it's
 

9447
03:04:59,399 --> 03:05:02,120
story at any given time in history it's
changed a bunch and it you know whether

9448
03:05:02,120 --> 03:05:02,130
changed a bunch and it you know whether

this because of that and a lot of those
 

9459
03:05:10,890 --> 03:05:13,490
this because of that and a lot of those
because is would have made no sense a

9460
03:05:13,490 --> 03:05:13,500
because is would have made no sense a
 

9461

yeah
whereas if you go back five hundred

9484
03:05:38,990 --> 03:05:39,000
whereas if you go back five hundred
 

9485
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:41,750
whereas if you go back five hundred
years you'd find a lot of people who are

9486
03:05:41,750 --> 03:05:41,760
years you'd find a lot of people who are
 

9487

what they would say um and so today
 

9491
03:05:47,390 --> 03:05:49,040
what they would say um and so today
because you've been thinking about

because you've been thinking about
 

9493
03:05:49,050 --> 03:05:51,530
because you've been thinking about
computation so much and been humbled by

9494
03:05:51,530 --> 03:05:51,540
computation so much and been humbled by
 

9495
03:05:51,540 --> 03:05:53,420
computation so much and been humbled by
it what do you think is the meaning of

03:06:29,179 --> 03:06:29,189
found interesting earlier in my life and
 

9525
03:06:29,189 --> 03:06:31,309
found interesting earlier in my life and
I know I found interesting like I got

9526
03:06:31,309 --> 03:06:31,319
I know I found interesting like I got
 

9527
03:06:31,319 --> 03:06:33,830
I know I found interesting like I got
interested in like education and

9528
03:06:33,830 --> 03:06:33,840
interested in like education and
 

9529
03:06:33,840 --> 03:06:35,389
interested in like education and
teaching people things and so on which I

9530
03:06:35,389 --> 03:06:35,399
teaching people things and so on which I
 

9531
03:06:35,399 --> 03:06:36,980
teaching people things and so on which I
didn't find that interesting when I was

9532
03:06:36,980 --> 03:06:36,990
didn't find that interesting when I was
 

9533
03:06:36,990 --> 03:06:40,670
didn't find that interesting when I was
younger um and you know can I justify

9534
03:06:40,670 --> 03:06:40,680
younger um and you know can I justify
 

9535
03:06:40,680 --> 03:06:43,519
younger um and you know can I justify
that in some big global sense I don't

9536
03:06:43,519 --> 03:06:43,529
that in some big global sense I don't

I think it might be important in the

9540
03:06:48,050 --> 03:06:48,060
I think it might be important in the
 

9541
03:06:48,060 --> 03:06:51,139
I think it might be important in the
world but I think my local reason for

9542
03:06:51,139 --> 03:06:51,149
world but I think my local reason for
 

9543
03:06:51,149 --> 03:06:53,109
world but I think my local reason for
doing it is that I find it personally

9544
03:06:53,109 --> 03:06:53,119
doing it is that I find it personally
 

9545
03:06:53,119 --> 03:06:54,969
doing it is that I find it personally
fulfilling which I can't you know

03:06:54,969 --> 03:06:54,979
fulfilling which I can't you know
 

9547
03:06:54,979 --> 03:06:59,019
fulfilling which I can't you know
explain in a sort of it's just like this

9548
03:06:59,019 --> 03:06:59,029
explain in a sort of it's just like this
 

9549
03:06:59,029 --> 03:07:01,029
explain in a sort of it's just like this
discussion of things like AI ethics you

9550
03:07:01,029 --> 03:07:01,039
discussion of things like AI ethics you
 

9551
03:07:01,039 --> 03:07:03,579
discussion of things like AI ethics you
know is there a ground truth to the

9552
03:07:03,579 --> 03:07:03,589
know is there a ground truth to the
 

9553
03:07:03,589 --> 03:07:05,439
know is there a ground truth to the
ethics that we should be having I don't

9554
03:07:05,439 --> 03:07:05,449
ethics that we should be having I don't
 

9555
03:07:05,449 --> 03:07:07,269
ethics that we should be having I don't
think I can find a ground truth to my

9556
03:07:07,269 --> 03:07:07,279
think I can find a ground truth to my
 

9557
03:07:07,279 --> 03:07:09,249
think I can find a ground truth to my
life any more than I can suggest a

9558
03:07:09,249 --> 03:07:09,259
life any more than I can suggest a
 

9559
03:07:09,259 --> 03:07:11,139
life any more than I can suggest a
ground truth for kind of the ethics for

9560
03:07:11,139 --> 03:07:11,149
ground truth for kind of the ethics for
 

9561
03:07:11,149 --> 03:07:13,539
ground truth for kind of the ethics for
the whole for the whole of civilization

9562
03:07:13,539 --> 03:07:13,549
the whole for the whole of civilization
 

9563
03:07:13,549 --> 03:07:18,219
the whole for the whole of civilization
and I think that's a you know my you

9564
03:07:18,219 --> 03:07:18,229
and I think that's a you know my you
 

9565
03:07:18,229 --> 03:07:21,639
and I think that's a you know my you
know it would be it would be a yeah it's

9566
03:07:21,639 --> 03:07:21,649
know it would be it would be a yeah it's
 

9567
03:07:21,649 --> 03:07:25,869
know it would be it would be a yeah it's
it's sort of a I think I'm I'm you know

9568
03:07:25,869 --> 03:07:25,879
it's sort of a I think I'm I'm you know
 

9569
03:07:25,879 --> 03:07:27,909
it's sort of a I think I'm I'm you know
at different times in my life I've had

9570
03:07:27,909 --> 03:07:27,919
at different times in my life I've had
 

9571
03:07:27,919 --> 03:07:31,329
at different times in my life I've had
different kind of gold structures and so

9572
03:07:31,329 --> 03:07:31,339
different kind of gold structures and so
 

9573
03:07:31,339 --> 03:07:33,399
different kind of gold structures and so
on although your perspective your local

9574
03:07:33,399 --> 03:07:33,409
on although your perspective your local
 

9575
03:07:33,409 --> 03:07:35,769
on although your perspective your local
your you're just a cell in the cellular

9576
03:07:35,769 --> 03:07:35,779
your you're just a cell in the cellular
 

9577
03:07:35,779 --> 03:07:38,499
your you're just a cell in the cellular
automata and but in some sense I find it

9578
03:07:38,499 --> 03:07:38,509
automata and but in some sense I find it
 

9579
03:07:38,509 --> 03:07:42,359
automata and but in some sense I find it
funny from my observation is I kind of

9580
03:07:42,359 --> 03:07:42,369
funny from my observation is I kind of
 

9581
03:07:42,369 --> 03:07:44,889
funny from my observation is I kind of
you know it seems that the universe is

9582
03:07:44,889 --> 03:07:44,899
you know it seems that the universe is
 

9583
03:07:44,899 --> 03:07:47,229
you know it seems that the universe is
using you to understand itself it's some

9584
03:07:47,229 --> 03:07:47,239
using you to understand itself it's some
 

9585
03:07:47,239 --> 03:07:49,869
using you to understand itself it's some
sense you're not aware of it yeah well

9586
03:07:49,869 --> 03:07:49,879
sense you're not aware of it yeah well
 

9587
03:07:49,879 --> 03:07:51,760
sense you're not aware of it yeah well
right well if it turns out that we

9588
03:07:51,760 --> 03:07:51,770
right well if it turns out that we
 

9589
03:07:51,770 --> 03:07:53,919
right well if it turns out that we

consciousness like what does the
 

9641
03:08:56,929 --> 03:08:58,479

the universe as the universe is or you
 

9649
03:09:06,229 --> 03:09:06,940
the universe as the universe is or you
can go off

9650
03:09:06,940 --> 03:09:06,950
can go off
 

9651
03:09:06,950 --> 03:09:09,520
can go off
you can go off that reservation and go

9652
03:09:09,520 --> 03:09:09,530
you can go off that reservation and go
 

9653
03:09:09,530 --> 03:09:11,140
you can go off that reservation and go
and start exploring the computational

9654
03:09:11,140 --> 03:09:11,150
and start exploring the computational
 

9655
03:09:11,150 --> 03:09:13,091
and start exploring the computational
universe of all possible universes yeah

9656
03:09:13,091 --> 03:09:13,101
universe of all possible universes yeah
 

9657
03:09:13,101 --> 03:09:16,000
universe of all possible universes yeah
and so in some vision of the future of

9658
03:09:16,000 --> 03:09:16,010
and so in some vision of the future of
 

9659
03:09:16,010 --> 03:09:18,070
and so in some vision of the future of
history it's like the disembodied

03:09:18,070 --> 03:09:18,080
history it's like the disembodied

consciousness is are all sort of

9662
03:09:20,890 --> 03:09:20,900
consciousness is are all sort of
 

9663
03:09:20,900 --> 03:09:22,900
consciousness is are all sort of
pursuing things like my new kind of

9664
03:09:22,900 --> 03:09:22,910
pursuing things like my new kind of
 

9665
03:09:22,910 --> 03:09:24,820
pursuing things like my new kind of
science sort of for the rest of eternity

9666
03:09:24,820 --> 03:09:24,830
science sort of for the rest of eternity
 

9667
03:09:24,830 --> 03:09:26,830
science sort of for the rest of eternity
so to speak and that that ends up being

9668
03:09:26,830 --> 03:09:26,840
so to speak and that that ends up being
 

9669
03:09:26,840 --> 03:09:31,051
so to speak and that that ends up being
the the kind of the the thing that um

9670
03:09:31,051 --> 03:09:31,061
the the kind of the the thing that um
 

9671
03:09:31,061 --> 03:09:33,671
the the kind of the the thing that um
represents the you know the future of

9672
03:09:33,671 --> 03:09:33,681
represents the you know the future of
 

9673
03:09:33,681 --> 03:09:36,011
represents the you know the future of
kind of the human condition I don't

9674
03:09:36,011 --> 03:09:36,021
kind of the human condition I don't
 

9675
03:09:36,021 --> 03:09:38,171
kind of the human condition I don't
think there's a better way to end it

9676
03:09:38,171 --> 03:09:38,181
think there's a better way to end it
 

9677
03:09:38,181 --> 03:09:40,060
