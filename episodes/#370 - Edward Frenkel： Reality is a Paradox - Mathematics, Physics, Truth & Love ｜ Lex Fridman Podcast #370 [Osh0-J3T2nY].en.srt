there is a famous story about Einstein

2
00:00:02,389 --> 00:00:02,399
there is a famous story about Einstein
 

3
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,789
there is a famous story about Einstein
that he used to you know go think think

4
00:00:04,789 --> 00:00:04,799
that he used to you know go think think
 

5
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,889
that he used to you know go think think
and then go for a walk and like he would

6
00:00:06,889 --> 00:00:06,899
and then go for a walk and like he would
 

7
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:08,810
and then go for a walk and like he would
whistle and sometimes so I remember the

8
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:08,820
whistle and sometimes so I remember the
 

9
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,730
whistle and sometimes so I remember the
first time I heard this story

10
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:10,740
first time I heard this story
 

11
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,589
first time I heard this story
I thought how interesting so the

12
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:12,599
I thought how interesting so the
 

13
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,390
I thought how interesting so the
coincidence that he came to him when he

14
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:14,400
coincidence that he came to him when he
 

15
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,790
coincidence that he came to him when he
was whistling but in fact it's not this

16
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:16,800
was whistling but in fact it's not this
 

17
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,210
was whistling but in fact it's not this
is how it works in some sense that

18
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:20,220
is how it works in some sense that
 

19
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,550
is how it works in some sense that
you have to prepare for it but then the

20
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:22,560
you have to prepare for it but then the
 

21
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,109
you have to prepare for it but then the
moment it happens when you stop thinking

22
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:24,119
moment it happens when you stop thinking
 

23
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:25,609
moment it happens when you stop thinking
actually it's okay the moment of

24
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:25,619
actually it's okay the moment of
 

25
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,009
actually it's okay the moment of
Discovery is the moment when thinking

26
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:28,019
Discovery is the moment when thinking
 

27
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,550
Discovery is the moment when thinking
stops and you know you kind of you kind

28
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:31,560
stops and you know you kind of you kind
 

29
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,330
stops and you know you kind of you kind

you open your book love and math with a

60
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:12,900
you open your book love and math with a
 

61
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,789
you open your book love and math with a
question

62
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:13,799
question
 

63
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,770
question
how does one become a mathematician

64
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:15,780
how does one become a mathematician
 

65
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,810
how does one become a mathematician
there are many ways that this can happen

66
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:17,820
there are many ways that this can happen
 

67
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,690
there are many ways that this can happen
let me tell you how it happened to me so

68
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:20,700
let me tell you how it happened to me so
 

69
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,390
let me tell you how it happened to me so
how did it happen to you so first of all

70
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:23,400
how did it happen to you so first of all
 

71
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,450
how did it happen to you so first of all
I grew up in the Soviet Union

72
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:26,460
I grew up in the Soviet Union
 

73
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,149
I grew up in the Soviet Union
in a small town near Moscow

74
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:29,159
in a small town near Moscow
 

75
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,570
in a small town near Moscow
called columna

76
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:31,580
called columna
 

77
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,630
called columna
and I was a smart kid you know in school

78
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
and I was a smart kid you know in school
 

79
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,850
and I was a smart kid you know in school
but mathematics was probably my least

80
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:37,860
but mathematics was probably my least
 

81
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,530
but mathematics was probably my least
favorite subject

82
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:39,540
favorite subject
 

83
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,929
favorite subject
not because I couldn't do it I was you

84
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:41,939
not because I couldn't do it I was you
 

85
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,530
not because I couldn't do it I was you
know a straight A student and I could do

86
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:44,540
know a straight A student and I could do
 

87
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,569
know a straight A student and I could do
all the problems easily but I thought it

88
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:47,579
all the problems easily but I thought it
 

89
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,789
all the problems easily but I thought it
was incredibly boring

90
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:49,799
was incredibly boring
 

91
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,410
was incredibly boring
and

92
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:51,420
and
 

93
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,170
and
um since the only math I knew was what

94
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:54,180
um since the only math I knew was what
 

95
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,870
um since the only math I knew was what
was presented at school

96
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:56,880
was presented at school
 

97
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,910
was presented at school
I thought that was it and I was like

98
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:58,920
I thought that was it and I was like
 

99
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,969
I thought that was it and I was like
what kind of boring subject is this so

100
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:01,979
what kind of boring subject is this so
 

101
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,130
what kind of boring subject is this so
what I really liked was physics

102
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:04,140
what I really liked was physics
 

103
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,310
what I really liked was physics
and especially quantum physics so I was

104
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:07,320
and especially quantum physics so I was
 

105
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,270
and especially quantum physics so I was
buying

106
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:08,280
buying
 

107
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,210
buying
uh I would go to a bookstore and buy

108
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:11,220
uh I would go to a bookstore and buy
 

109
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,350
uh I would go to a bookstore and buy
popular books about elementary particles

110
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360
popular books about elementary particles
 

111
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,130
popular books about elementary particles
and atoms and things like that and read

112
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:19,140
and atoms and things like that and read
 

113
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,770
and atoms and things like that and read
them you know devour them

114
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:21,780
them you know devour them
 

115
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,650
them you know devour them
and so I thought my dream was to become

116
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:24,660
and so I thought my dream was to become
 

117
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,869
and so I thought my dream was to become
a theoretical physicist

118
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
a theoretical physicist
 

119
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,930
a theoretical physicist
and to delve into this finer structure

120
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:29,940
and to delve into this finer structure
 

121
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,150
and to delve into this finer structure
of the universe you know so then

122
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,160
of the universe you know so then
 

123
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,790
of the universe you know so then
something happened when I was 15 years

124
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:34,800
something happened when I was 15 years
 

125
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,970
something happened when I was 15 years
old uh it turns out that a friend of my

126
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:37,980
old uh it turns out that a friend of my
 

127
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,990
old uh it turns out that a friend of my
parents

128
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,000
parents
 

129
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,690
parents
was a mathematician who was a professor

130
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:41,700
was a mathematician who was a professor
 

131
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,309
was a mathematician who was a professor
at the local College it was a small

132
00:02:43,309 --> 00:02:43,319
at the local College it was a small
 

133
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:46,369
at the local College it was a small
College preparing Educators and teachers

134
00:02:46,369 --> 00:02:46,379
College preparing Educators and teachers
 

135
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,589
College preparing Educators and teachers
it's a provincial Town imagine it's like

136
00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:48,599
it's a provincial Town imagine it's like
 

137
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,410
it's a provincial Town imagine it's like
a 117 kilometers from Moscow which would

138
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:51,420
a 117 kilometers from Moscow which would
 

139
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,750
a 117 kilometers from Moscow which would
be something like 70 miles I guess you

140
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760
be something like 70 miles I guess you
 

141
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,509
be something like 70 miles I guess you
do the math I like how you remember the

142
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:56,519
do the math I like how you remember the
 

143
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,670
do the math I like how you remember the
number exactly yeah it's not funny how

144
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:58,680
number exactly yeah it's not funny how
 

145
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,690
number exactly yeah it's not funny how
we remember numbers yeah so his name was

146
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:01,700
we remember numbers yeah so his name was
 

147
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,750
we remember numbers yeah so his name was
evgeny evgenievich Petrov yeah and if

148
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:05,760
evgeny evgenievich Petrov yeah and if
 

149
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,369
evgeny evgenievich Petrov yeah and if
this doesn't remind you of the great

150
00:03:07,369 --> 00:03:07,379
this doesn't remind you of the great
 

151
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,190
this doesn't remind you of the great
works of Russian literature then you

152
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:10,200
works of Russian literature then you
 

153
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,350
works of Russian literature then you
haven't read them

154
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,360
haven't read them
 

155
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,850
haven't read them
like War and Peace you know like with

156
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:13,860
like War and Peace you know like with
 

157
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,949
like War and Peace you know like with
the patronym nickname yeah but this was

158
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:15,959
the patronym nickname yeah but this was
 

159
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,369

told him about me
 

165
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,330
told him about me
but that was this bright kid and

166
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:26,340
but that was this bright kid and
 

167
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,009
but that was this bright kid and
interested in physics

168
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:28,019
interested in physics
 

169
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:31,490
interested in physics
and he said oh I want to meet him I'm

170
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:31,500
and he said oh I want to meet him I'm
 

171
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,890
and he said oh I want to meet him I'm
going to convert him into math

172
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:33,900
going to convert him into math
 

173
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,170
going to convert him into math
and my mom's like nah my ass he doesn't

174
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:36,180
and my mom's like nah my ass he doesn't
 

175
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,509
and my mom's like nah my ass he doesn't
like mathematics so they said okay let's

176
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:38,519
like mathematics so they said okay let's
 

177
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,490
like mathematics so they said okay let's
let's see what they can do

178
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:40,500
let's see what they can do
 

179
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,729
let's see what they can do
so I went to see him so I'm about 15.

180
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:43,739
so I went to see him so I'm about 15.
 

181
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:46,610
so I went to see him so I'm about 15.
and a bit a bit uh arrogant I would say

182
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:46,620
and a bit a bit uh arrogant I would say
 

183
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,210
and a bit a bit uh arrogant I would say
you know like average teenager

184
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:49,220
you know like average teenager
 

185
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,550
you know like average teenager
so he says to me

186
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
so he says to me
 

187
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,550
so he says to me
so I hear that you are

188
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:55,560
so I hear that you are
 

189
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,130
so I hear that you are
um interested in in physics Elementary

190
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:58,140
um interested in in physics Elementary
 

191
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,830
um interested in in physics Elementary
particles I said yeah sure

192
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:00,840
particles I said yeah sure
 

193
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,309
particles I said yeah sure
for example do you know what quirks

194
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319
for example do you know what quirks
 

195
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,110
for example do you know what quirks
and I said yes of course I know what

196
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:06,120
and I said yes of course I know what
 

197
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,809
and I said yes of course I know what
quarks quarks are the you know

198
00:04:08,809 --> 00:04:08,819
quarks quarks are the you know
 

199
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:10,429

of particles like protons and neutrons
 

203
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,050
of particles like protons and neutrons
and it was one of the greatest

204
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:15,060
and it was one of the greatest
 

205
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,629
and it was one of the greatest
discoveries in theoretical physics in

206
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:17,639
discoveries in theoretical physics in
 

207
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,150
discoveries in theoretical physics in
the 60s that those particles were not

208
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:20,160
the 60s that those particles were not
 

209
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,670
the 60s that those particles were not
Elementary but in fact had the smaller

210
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:22,680
Elementary but in fact had the smaller
 

211
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,510

and he said oh so then you probably know

214
00:04:25,249 --> 00:04:25,259
and he said oh so then you probably know
 

215
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,090
and he said oh so then you probably know
representation theory of the group su3

representation theory of the group su3
 

217
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,510
representation theory of the group su3
this is like as you worked so

218
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:32,520
this is like as you worked so
 

219
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,249
this is like as you worked so
in fact

220
00:04:34,249 --> 00:04:34,259
in fact
 

221
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:37,129
in fact
I wanted to know what was what were the

222
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:37,139
I wanted to know what was what were the
 

223
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:39,409
I wanted to know what was what were the
underpinnings of those theories I knew

224
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:39,419
underpinnings of those theories I knew
 

225
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,030
underpinnings of those theories I knew
the story I knew the narrative a new

226
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,040
the story I knew the narrative a new
 

227
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,730
the story I knew the narrative a new
kind of this basic story of what this

228
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:43,740
kind of this basic story of what this
 

229
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,230
kind of this basic story of what this
particles looked like but how did

230
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:45,240
particles looked like but how did
 

231
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,230
particles looked like but how did
physicists come up with these ideas

232
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:48,240
physicists come up with these ideas
 

233
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,749
physicists come up with these ideas
how were they able to theorize them

234
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:50,759
how were they able to theorize them
 

235
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,850
how were they able to theorize them
and so I remembered you know like it was

236
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:52,860
and so I remembered you know like it was
 

237
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,430
and so I remembered you know like it was
yesterday so he pulls out a book

238
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440
yesterday so he pulls out a book
 

239
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,770
yesterday so he pulls out a book
and it's kind of like it's like a Bible

240
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:57,780
and it's kind of like it's like a Bible
 

241
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,870
and it's kind of like it's like a Bible
you know like a like a substantial book

242
00:04:59,870 --> 00:04:59,880
you know like a like a substantial book
 

243
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,510
you know like a like a substantial book
and he opens um somewhere in the middle

244
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:02,520
and he opens um somewhere in the middle
 

245
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,629
and he opens um somewhere in the middle
and there I see the diagrams that I saw

246
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:05,639
and there I see the diagrams that I saw
 

247
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,490
and there I see the diagrams that I saw
in popular books but in popular books

248
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:07,500
in popular books but in popular books
 

249
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,490
in popular books but in popular books
there was no explanation and now I see

250
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:10,500
there was no explanation and now I see
 

251
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,290
there was no explanation and now I see
all these weird symbols and equations

252
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:12,300
all these weird symbols and equations
 

253
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,050
all these weird symbols and equations
it's clear that it is explained in there

254
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:15,060
it's clear that it is explained in there
 

255
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,390
it's clear that it is explained in there
oh my God

it's like no this is real mathematics

262
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:25,560
it's like no this is real mathematics
 

263
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,010
it's like no this is real mathematics
so I was instantly converted

264
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:28,020
so I was instantly converted
 

265
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,010
so I was instantly converted

it or is it like the philosophical thing
now I am looking back yeah so um

328
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:41,639
now I am looking back yeah so um
 

329
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,730
now I am looking back yeah so um
whatever I say about Edward at 15 yeah

330
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:46,740
whatever I say about Edward at 15 yeah
 

331
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,770
whatever I say about Edward at 15 yeah
he's colored by

332
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:48,780
he's colored by
 

333
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,070
he's colored by
uh my you know all my experiences that

334
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,080
uh my you know all my experiences that
 

335
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,290
uh my you know all my experiences that
happen in in the meantime I should say

336
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:54,300
happen in in the meantime I should say
 

337
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,090
happen in in the meantime I should say
current views and so on for the people

338
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:56,100
current views and so on for the people
 

339
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,430
current views and so on for the people
who may not know you I think your book

340
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:58,440
who may not know you I think your book
 

341
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,890
who may not know you I think your book
and your presentations kind of revealed

342
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:00,900
and your presentations kind of revealed
 

343
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,510
and your presentations kind of revealed
that that 15 year old is still in there

344
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:02,520
that that 15 year old is still in there
 

345
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,650
that that 15 year old is still in there
somewhere

346
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:03,660
somewhere
 

347
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,050
somewhere
I think it is a conflict some of the joy

348
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:06,060
I think it is a conflict some of the joy
 

349
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,809
I think it is a conflict some of the joy
he's probably still here now yes yeah in

350
00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:08,819
he's probably still here now yes yeah in
 

351
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,309
he's probably still here now yes yeah in
some way

352
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319
some way
 

353
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,990
some way
yeah I think it was a joy of Discovery

354
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000
yeah I think it was a joy of Discovery
 

355
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,450
yeah I think it was a joy of Discovery
and the joy of going deeper into the

356
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:14,460
and the joy of going deeper into the
 

357
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,249
and the joy of going deeper into the
kind of the

358
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:16,259
kind of the
 

359
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:20,629
kind of the
uh to the root uh to the so the deepest

360
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:20,639
uh to the root uh to the so the deepest
 

361
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,189
uh to the root uh to the so the deepest
structures of the universe the secrets

362
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:22,199
structures of the universe the secrets
 

363
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:26,089
structures of the universe the secrets
the the secrets and we may not discover

364
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:26,099
the the secrets and we may not discover
 

365
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,070
the the secrets and we may not discover
all of them we may not be able to

366
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080
all of them we may not be able to
 

367
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,290
all of them we may not be able to
understand but we're going to try and go

368
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:30,300
understand but we're going to try and go
 

369
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,290
understand but we're going to try and go
as far and as deep as we can I think

370
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:33,300
as far and as deep as we can I think
 

371
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,350
as far and as deep as we can I think
that's what was the motivating factor in

372
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:36,360
that's what was the motivating factor in
 

373
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,309
that's what was the motivating factor in
this

374
00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:37,319
this
 

375
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,409
this
yeah there's this mystery there's this

376
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:39,419
yeah there's this mystery there's this
 

377
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:41,510
yeah there's this mystery there's this
dark room and there's a few of these

378
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:41,520
dark room and there's a few of these
 

379
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,249
dark room and there's a few of these
mathematical physicists they're able to

380
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:43,259
mathematical physicists they're able to
 

381
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:44,770
mathematical physicists they're able to
shine

382
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:44,780
shine
 

383
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,589
shine
a flashlight briefly into there

384
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:48,599
a flashlight briefly into there
 

385
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,749
a flashlight briefly into there
uh we'll we'll talk about it but it also

386
00:07:50,749 --> 00:07:50,759
uh we'll we'll talk about it but it also
 

387
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,689
uh we'll we'll talk about it but it also
kind of makes me sad that there's so few

388
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:53,699
kind of makes me sad that there's so few
 

389
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:56,809
kind of makes me sad that there's so few
of your kind that have the the

390
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:56,819
of your kind that have the the
 

391
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:00,770
of your kind that have the the
flashlight to look into the room

392
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:00,780
flashlight to look into the room
 

393
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,809
flashlight to look into the room
it's interesting

394
00:08:02,809 --> 00:08:02,819
it's interesting
 

395
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,490
it's interesting
um I don't think there are so few to be

396
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:04,500
um I don't think there are so few to be
 

397
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,309
um I don't think there are so few to be
honest because I think I find a lot of

398
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:07,319
honest because I think I find a lot of
 

399
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,950
honest because I think I find a lot of
people are actually interested if you do

400
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:09,960
people are actually interested if you do
 

401
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,510
people are actually interested if you do
talk if you talk to people you know like

402
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520
talk if you talk to people you know like
 

403
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,469
talk if you talk to people you know like
some people you wouldn't expect to uh to

404
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:15,479
some people you wouldn't expect to uh to
 

405
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:18,230
some people you wouldn't expect to uh to
be interested in this uh from all walks

406
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
be interested in this uh from all walks
 

407
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,529
be interested in this uh from all walks
of life from people of

408
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:20,539
of life from people of
 

409
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:23,270
of life from people of
all kinds of professions I tell them I'm

410
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:23,280
all kinds of professions I tell them I'm
 

411
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,550
all kinds of professions I tell them I'm
a mathematician and the mathematician

412
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:25,560
a mathematician and the mathematician
 

413
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,350
a mathematician and the mathematician
okay so that's a separate story a lot of

414
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,360
okay so that's a separate story a lot of
 

415
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,330
okay so that's a separate story a lot of
people I think have been traumatized by

416
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:29,340
people I think have been traumatized by
 

417
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,309
people I think have been traumatized by
their experience in their math classes

418
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:31,319
their experience in their math classes
 

419
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,649
their experience in their math classes
we can talk about it later but then they

420
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:33,659
we can talk about it later but then they
 

421
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,930
we can talk about it later but then they
ask me what kind of research I do and

422
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:35,940
ask me what kind of research I do and
 

423
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,110
ask me what kind of research I do and
I I mentioned that I I work on the

424
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,120
I I mentioned that I I work on the
 

425
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,389
I I mentioned that I I work on the
interface of math and quantum physics

426
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:41,399
interface of math and quantum physics
 

427
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,250
interface of math and quantum physics
and their eyes light up and say oh

428
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:43,260
and their eyes light up and say oh
 

429
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,990
and their eyes light up and say oh
quantum physics or like Einstein's

430
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,000
quantum physics or like Einstein's
 

431
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,790
quantum physics or like Einstein's
relativity I'm really curious about it I

432
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:46,800
relativity I'm really curious about it I
 

433
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,410
relativity I'm really curious about it I
watched this podcast or I watch that

434
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:48,420
watched this podcast or I watch that
 

435
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,090
watched this podcast or I watch that
podcast you know and I've learned this

436
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:50,100
podcast you know and I've learned this
 

437
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,290
podcast you know and I've learned this
it's like what do you think about that

438
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:51,300
it's like what do you think about that
 

439
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,870
it's like what do you think about that
so I actually find that that actually

440
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:53,880
so I actually find that that actually
 

441
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,269
so I actually find that that actually
physicists are doing great job at

442
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:56,279
physicists are doing great job at
 

443
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,410
physicists are doing great job at
educating

444
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:57,420
educating
 

445
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,930
educating
the public so to speak and uh in terms

mathematicians are behind that we're

454
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:09,000
mathematicians are behind that we're
 

455
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,910
mathematicians are behind that we're
starting to catch up a little bit have

456
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:10,920
starting to catch up a little bit have
 

457
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,009
starting to catch up a little bit have
been starting last 10 years but when

458
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:13,019
been starting last 10 years but when
 

459
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,930
been starting last 10 years but when
we're still behind but I think people

460
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:14,940
we're still behind but I think people
 

461
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,610
we're still behind but I think people
are people are curious

462
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:16,620
are people are curious
 

463
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,670
are people are curious
science is a is still a very much uh you

464
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,680
science is a is still a very much uh you
 

465
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,290
science is a is still a very much uh you
know something that people want to learn

466
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:21,300
know something that people want to learn
 

467
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,630
know something that people want to learn
because that's our kind of uh the best

468
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:23,640
because that's our kind of uh the best
 

469
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,210
because that's our kind of uh the best
way we know to establish some sort of

470
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:26,220
way we know to establish some sort of
 

471
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,790
way we know to establish some sort of
objective reality whatever that might be

472
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
objective reality whatever that might be
 

473
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,550
objective reality whatever that might be
yeah to figure out this whole puzzle to

474
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:31,560
yeah to figure out this whole puzzle to
 

475
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,930
yeah to figure out this whole puzzle to
figure out the secrets that the Universe

476
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:32,940
figure out the secrets that the Universe
 

477
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,430
figure out the secrets that the Universe
holds things that we can agree on kind

478
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:34,440
holds things that we can agree on kind
 

479
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,889
holds things that we can agree on kind
of you know like even though for me at

480
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:36,899
of you know like even though for me at
 

481
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:38,810
of you know like even though for me at
this point I always you know make an

482
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:38,820
this point I always you know make an
 

483
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,430
this point I always you know make an
argument that our physical theorists

484
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:40,440
argument that our physical theorists
 

485
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,590
argument that our physical theorists
always change they get updated so you

um so this tabletop has two Dimensions

626
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:36,779
um so this tabletop has two Dimensions

00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:39,110
um so this tabletop has two Dimensions
because you can have two axes two

and then there's a Time Time Dimension
 

637
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,350

at the core of you know

760
00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:25,079

 

761
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:27,050

I would say mathematics is one half of

762
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:27,060
I would say mathematics is one half of
 

763
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,689
I would say mathematics is one half of
the core so the book is called love and

764
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:29,699
the core so the book is called love and
 

765
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:31,310
the core so the book is called love and
math yeah okay so these are the two

766
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:31,320
math yeah okay so these are the two
 

767
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,769
math yeah okay so these are the two
pillars

769
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:37,490

yeah in my view yes in other words you

770
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:37,500
yeah in my view yes in other words you
 

771
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,470
yeah in my view yes in other words you
can't cover everything by math so

772
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:39,480
can't cover everything by math so
 

773
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,449
can't cover everything by math so
mathematics gives you tools it gives you

774
00:15:41,449 --> 00:15:41,459
mathematics gives you tools it gives you
 

775

00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,430
one point of view is that it is eternity
which is fundamental where time stands

980
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:37,440
which is fundamental where time stands
 

981
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,090
which is fundamental where time stands
still which our mind conceptualizes as

982
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:41,100
still which our mind conceptualizes as
 

983
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,529
still which our mind conceptualizes as
the time

984
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:42,539
the time
 

985
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:44,510
the time
so but in fact you know it's not

986
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:44,520
so but in fact you know it's not
 

987
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,490
so but in fact you know it's not
something mystical if you think about

988
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:46,500
something mystical if you think about
 

989
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,010
something mystical if you think about
when you about it

990
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:49,020
when you about it
 

991
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,890
when you about it
when you really absorbed in something

992
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:51,900
when you really absorbed in something
 

993
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,350
when you really absorbed in something
time does stand still and then you look

994
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:54,360
time does stand still and then you look
 

995
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,730
time does stand still and then you look
at the clock and it's like oh my God two

996
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:55,740
at the clock and it's like oh my God two
 

997
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,830
at the clock and it's like oh my God two
hours have passed and it felt like a

998
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:57,840
hours have passed and it felt like a
 

999
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,210
hours have passed and it felt like a
couple of seconds

1000
00:19:59,210 --> 00:19:59,220
couple of seconds
 

1001
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,730
couple of seconds
when you are absorbed when you're in

1002
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:01,740
when you are absorbed when you're in
 

1003
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,650
when you are absorbed when you're in
love when you are passionate about

1004
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:03,660
love when you are passionate about
 

1005
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,070
love when you are passionate about
something when you're creating something

1006
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,080
something when you're creating something
 

1007
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,830
something when you're creating something
you're we lose ourselves and we lose the

1008
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:09,840
you're we lose ourselves and we lose the
 

1009
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,690
you're we lose ourselves and we lose the
sense of time and space for that matter

1010
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:11,700
sense of time and space for that matter
 

1011
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,029
sense of time and space for that matter
you see so there is only that which is

1012
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:14,039
you see so there is only that which is
 

1013
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:18,169
you see so there is only that which is
happening that creative process

1014
00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:18,179
happening that creative process
 

1015
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:19,730
happening that creative process
um so I think that this this is familiar

1016
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:19,740
um so I think that this this is familiar
 

1017
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,070
um so I think that this this is familiar
to all of us and we may be actually the

1018
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,080
to all of us and we may be actually the
 

1019
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,549
to all of us and we may be actually the
closest to the truth at that moment

1020
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:24,559
closest to the truth at that moment
 

1021
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,590
closest to the truth at that moment
so yes so then there is a point of view

1022
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:27,600
so yes so then there is a point of view
 

1023
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,930
so yes so then there is a point of view
that this is where we are we are who we

1024
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:29,940
that this is where we are we are who we
 

1025
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,810
that this is where we are we are who we
are at our sort of fundamental at our

1026
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:32,820
are at our sort of fundamental at our
 

1027
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,450
are at our sort of fundamental at our
fundamental level and after that the

1028
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:35,460
fundamental level and after that the
 

1029
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,890
fundamental level and after that the
Mind comes in

1030
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:36,900
Mind comes in
 

1031
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,230
Mind comes in
and tries to conceptualize it it's like

1032
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:39,240
and tries to conceptualize it it's like
 

1033
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,810
and tries to conceptualize it it's like
oh because I was writing something

1034
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:41,820
oh because I was writing something
 

1035
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,529
oh because I was writing something
um

1036
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:42,539
um
 

1037
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:45,409
um
I was writing a book I was painting this

1038
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:45,419
I was writing a book I was painting this
 

1039
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:47,270
I was writing a book I was painting this
painting or maybe I was watching this

1040
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,280
painting or maybe I was watching this
 

1041
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,950
painting or maybe I was watching this
painting and got totally absorbed in it

1042
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:48,960
painting and got totally absorbed in it
 

1043
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,630
painting and got totally absorbed in it
or I fell in love with this person

1044
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:50,640
or I fell in love with this person
 

1045
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,850
or I fell in love with this person
that's what happened but in the moment

1046
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:52,860
that's what happened but in the moment
 

1047
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,230
that's what happened but in the moment
when it's happening you're not thinking

1048
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:54,240
when it's happening you're not thinking
 

1049
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,350
when it's happening you're not thinking
about it you're just there yeah we

1050
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:57,360
about it you're just there yeah we
 

1051
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,210
about it you're just there yeah we
construct narratives around the set of

1052
00:20:59,210 --> 00:20:59,220
construct narratives around the set of
 

1053
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,070
construct narratives around the set of
memories that that seem to have happened

1054
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:01,080
memories that that seem to have happened
 

1055
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,930
memories that that seem to have happened
in sequence or at least that's the way

1056
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:02,940
in sequence or at least that's the way
 

1057
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,690
in sequence or at least that's the way
we tell ourselves that and we also have

1058
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:05,700
we tell ourselves that and we also have
 

1059
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,090
we tell ourselves that and we also have
a bunch of weird human things like

1060
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:08,100
a bunch of weird human things like
 

1061
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,610
a bunch of weird human things like
Consciousness and the experience of free

1062
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:10,620
Consciousness and the experience of free
 

1063
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,990
Consciousness and the experience of free
will that we chose a set of actions as

1064
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:15,000
will that we chose a set of actions as
 

1065
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,630
will that we chose a set of actions as
the time unrolled forward right

1066
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:17,640
the time unrolled forward right
 

1067
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,470
the time unrolled forward right
and we are intelligent conscious agents

1068
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:21,480
and we are intelligent conscious agents
 

1069
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,830
and we are intelligent conscious agents
making taste taking those actions

1070
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:24,840
making taste taking those actions
 

1071
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,049
making taste taking those actions
but what if all of that is just an

1072
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:27,059
but what if all of that is just an
 

1073
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:29,270
but what if all of that is just an
illusion an illusion and a nice

1074
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,280
illusion an illusion and a nice
 

1075
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,590
illusion an illusion and a nice
narrative would tell ourselves sure

1076
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:30,600
narrative would tell ourselves sure
 

1077
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,930
narrative would tell ourselves sure
that's a really difficult thing and

1078
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:32,940
that's a really difficult thing and
 

1079
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,669
that's a really difficult thing and
imagine imagine that to make it really

1080
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:34,679
imagine imagine that to make it really
 

1081
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:37,250
imagine imagine that to make it really
Catch-22 that I'll imagine that our

1082
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:37,260
Catch-22 that I'll imagine that our
 

1083
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,549
Catch-22 that I'll imagine that our
minds and are set up in such a way yeah

1084
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:40,559
minds and are set up in such a way yeah
 

1085
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,890
minds and are set up in such a way yeah
that they can't approach the world or

1086
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:42,900
that they can't approach the world or
 

1087
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,870
that they can't approach the world or
experience otherwise

1088
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:44,880
experience otherwise
 

1089
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,870
experience otherwise
so in other words to understand to see

1090
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:47,880
so in other words to understand to see
 

1091
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,409
so in other words to understand to see
that from a more

1092
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:50,419
that from a more
 

1093
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:53,090
that from a more
kind of all-encompassing point of view

1094
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:53,100
kind of all-encompassing point of view
 

1095
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,490
kind of all-encompassing point of view
we have to step out of the Mind

1096
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:55,500
we have to step out of the Mind
 

1097
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,230
we have to step out of the Mind
well I wonder what's the more honest way

1098
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:57,240
well I wonder what's the more honest way
 

1099
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,789
well I wonder what's the more honest way
to look at things

1100
00:21:58,789 --> 00:21:58,799
to look at things
 

1101
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,010
to look at things
but I think we like to be to play with

1102
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:01,020
but I think we like to be to play with
 

1103
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,930
but I think we like to be to play with
time I think we like to play with these

1104
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:02,940
time I think we like to play with these
 

1105
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,610
time I think we like to play with these
experiences with all the drama of it

1106
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:04,620
experiences with all the drama of it
 

1107
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,289
experiences with all the drama of it
with all the memories with all the

1108
00:22:06,289 --> 00:22:06,299
with all the memories with all the
 

1109
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:08,990
with all the memories with all the
tribulations I think we love it we love

1110
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:09,000
tribulations I think we love it we love
 

1111
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,990
tribulations I think we love it we love
it otherwise we wouldn't be doing it I

1112
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:12,000
it otherwise we wouldn't be doing it I
 

1113
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,149
it otherwise we wouldn't be doing it I
think this or Earth loves it The

1114
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:14,159
think this or Earth loves it The
 

1115
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,770
think this or Earth loves it The
evolutionary process somehow loves it

1116
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:15,780
evolutionary process somehow loves it
 

1117
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,990
evolutionary process somehow loves it
whatever whatever this thing that's

1118
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,000
whatever whatever this thing that's
 

1119
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,350
whatever whatever this thing that's
being created here on Earth it seems to

1120
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:21,360
being created here on Earth it seems to
 

1121
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,110
being created here on Earth it seems to
like to create like to allow its

1122
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:24,120
like to create like to allow its
 

1123
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,250
like to create like to allow its
children to play with certain uh yeah

1124
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:27,260
children to play with certain uh yeah
 

1125
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,870
children to play with certain uh yeah
truths that they hold this subjective

1126
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:29,880
truths that they hold this subjective
 

1127
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,549
truths that they hold this subjective
truths that are useful for the

we call Life broadly Define not just

1132
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:35,640
we call Life broadly Define not just
 

1133
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,970
we call Life broadly Define not just
humans and and you know I'm glad you

1134
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:37,980
humans and and you know I'm glad you
 

1135
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,409
humans and and you know I'm glad you

1295
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:53,870
don't even think of you don't think in
these terms you just play you're just

1296
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:53,880
these terms you just play you're just
 

1297
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,510
these terms you just play you're just
playing and you are open to

1298
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:56,520
playing and you are open to
 

1299
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,070
playing and you are open to
possibilities to these infinite

1300
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:58,080
possibilities to these infinite
 

1301
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,810
possibilities to these infinite
possibilities that this world presents

1302
00:25:59,810 --> 00:25:59,820
possibilities that this world presents
 

1303
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,890
possibilities that this world presents
to us so how do we I'm not saying that

1304
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:03,900
to us so how do we I'm not saying that
 

1305
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:08,450
to us so how do we I'm not saying that
education system should not be also uh

1306
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:08,460
education system should not be also uh
 

1307
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,090
education system should not be also uh
kind of taming that a little bit

1308
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:11,100
kind of taming that a little bit
 

1309
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,710
kind of taming that a little bit
obviously

1310
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:12,720
obviously
 

1311
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,930
obviously
the goal is balance

1312
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:14,940
the goal is balance
 

1313
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,649
the goal is balance
that acquiring knowledge

1314
00:26:18,649 --> 00:26:18,659
that acquiring knowledge
 

1315
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:19,970
that acquiring knowledge
so that

1316
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:19,980
so that
 

1317
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,850
so that
we can be more mature and more

1318
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:22,860
we can be more mature and more
 

1319
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,490
we can be more mature and more
discerning more discriminating in terms

1320
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:25,500
discerning more discriminating in terms
 

1321
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,409
discerning more discriminating in terms
of our approach to the world in terms of

1322
00:26:27,409 --> 00:26:27,419
of our approach to the world in terms of
 

1323
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,149
of our approach to the world in terms of
our connections to the world and people

1324
00:26:29,149 --> 00:26:29,159
our connections to the world and people
 

1325
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:32,510
our connections to the world and people
and so on but how we do we do that while

1326
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:32,520
and so on but how we do we do that while
 

1327
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,750
and so on but how we do we do that while
also preserving that innocence of a

1328
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:35,760
also preserving that innocence of a
 

1329
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,529
also preserving that innocence of a
child

1330
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:36,539
child
 

1331
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:39,529
child
and my guess is that there is no formula

1332
00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:39,539
and my guess is that there is no formula
 

1333
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:42,230
and my guess is that there is no formula
for this it is

1334
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:42,240
for this it is
 

1335
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,750
for this it is
alive is an answer every life every

1336
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:44,760
alive is an answer every life every
 

1337
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,110
alive is an answer every life every
human being is one particular answer to

1338
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:48,120
human being is one particular answer to
 

1339
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,010
human being is one particular answer to
how do we find balance

1340
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:51,020
how do we find balance
 

1341
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:54,850
how do we find balance
uh that's once imperfect approximation

1342
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:54,860
uh that's once imperfect approximation
 

1343
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,310
uh that's once imperfect approximation
approximate solution

1344
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:57,320
approximate solution
 

1345
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,649
approximate solution
but we could look we can look up to the

1346
00:27:00,649 --> 00:27:00,659
but we could look we can look up to the
 

1347
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:03,850
but we could look we can look up to the
great ones yeah who have

1348
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:03,860
great ones yeah who have
 

1349
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,169
great ones yeah who have
credentials in the sense that they have

1350
00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:06,179
credentials in the sense that they have
 

1351
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:07,850
credentials in the sense that they have
shown and they have proved that they

1352
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:07,860
shown and they have proved that they
 

1353
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,370
shown and they have proved that they
have done something that other humans

1354
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:10,380
have done something that other humans
 

1355
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,010
have done something that other humans
appreciate our civilization appreciates

1356
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:13,020
appreciate our civilization appreciates
 

1357
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,070
appreciate our civilization appreciates
say Isaac Newton or Alexander grotonic

1358
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:16,080
say Isaac Newton or Alexander grotonic
 

1359
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,870
say Isaac Newton or Alexander grotonic
or Pablo Picasso so they have

1360
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:17,880
or Pablo Picasso so they have
 

1361
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,510
or Pablo Picasso so they have
established their rights to speak about

1362
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:20,520
established their rights to speak about
 

1363
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,090
established their rights to speak about
this matters and we could not dismiss

1364
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:23,100
this matters and we could not dismiss
 

1365
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,549
this matters and we could not dismiss
them as mere Madman

1366
00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:25,559
them as mere Madman
 

1367
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:28,010
them as mere Madman
they say okay well if the same thing was

1368
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:28,020
they say okay well if the same thing was
 

1369
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,409
they say okay well if the same thing was
said by somebody who never achieved

1370
00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:30,419
said by somebody who never achieved
 

1371
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:32,990
said by somebody who never achieved
anything in in that in their in their

1372
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:33,000
anything in in that in their in their
 

1373
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,990
anything in in that in their in their
field of endeavor you will be it would

1374
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:36,000
field of endeavor you will be it would
 

1375
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,269
field of endeavor you will be it would
be easy for us to dismiss it but when it

1376
00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:38,279
be easy for us to dismiss it but when it
 

1377
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:42,110
be easy for us to dismiss it but when it
comes from someone like Isaac Newton

1378
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:42,120
comes from someone like Isaac Newton
 

1379
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,750
comes from someone like Isaac Newton
we take notice so I think it's something

1380
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:44,760
we take notice so I think it's something
 

1381
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,029
we take notice so I think it's something
important that they teach us and

1382
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:47,039
important that they teach us and
 

1383
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,630
important that they teach us and
especially today in this age of AI

1384
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:50,640
especially today in this age of AI
 

1385
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,190
especially today in this age of AI
of course there's a big elephant in the

1386
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:52,200
of course there's a big elephant in the
 

1387
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,769
of course there's a big elephant in the
room always which is called AI yeah

1388
00:27:54,769 --> 00:27:54,779
room always which is called AI yeah
 

1389
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:56,690
room always which is called AI yeah
right and so I know that you are an

1390
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:56,700
right and so I know that you are an
 

1391
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,310
right and so I know that you are an
expert in this subject

1392
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:58,320
expert in this subject
 

1393
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,769
expert in this subject
and we are going we're living now in

1394
00:28:00,769 --> 00:28:00,779
and we are going we're living now in
 

1395
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:03,529
and we are going we're living now in
this very interesting times of new AI

1396
00:28:03,529 --> 00:28:03,539
this very interesting times of new AI
 

1397
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:06,049
this very interesting times of new AI
systems coming online pretty much every

1398
00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:06,059
systems coming online pretty much every
 

1399
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,370
systems coming online pretty much every
couple of weeks

1400
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:07,380
couple of weeks
 

1401
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,750
couple of weeks
so

1402
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:08,760
so
 

1403
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,769
so
I kind of um to me that whole debate

1404
00:28:12,769 --> 00:28:12,779
I kind of um to me that whole debate
 

1405
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:13,970
I kind of um to me that whole debate
about

1406
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:13,980
about
 

1407
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,590
about
what is it what is artificial

1408
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:15,600
what is it what is artificial
 

1409
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,909
what is it what is artificial
intelligence where is it going what

1410
00:28:16,909 --> 00:28:16,919
intelligence where is it going what
 

1411
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:18,730
intelligence where is it going what
should we do about it

1412
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:18,740
should we do about it
 

1413
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,250
should we do about it
needs an influx of this type of

1414
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:22,260
needs an influx of this type of
 

1415
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,289
needs an influx of this type of
considerations that we've just been

1416
00:28:24,289 --> 00:28:24,299
considerations that we've just been
 

1417
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:25,430
considerations that we've just been
talking about

1418
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:25,440
talking about
 

1419
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,850
talking about
that for instance the idea that

1420
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:28,860
that for instance the idea that
 

1421
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,970
that for instance the idea that
inspiration creativity doesn't come from

1422
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:31,980
inspiration creativity doesn't come from
 

1423
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,409
inspiration creativity doesn't come from
accumulation of knowledge because

1424
00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:33,419
accumulation of knowledge because
 

1425
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:36,110
accumulation of knowledge because
obviously child a child has not yet

1426
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:36,120
obviously child a child has not yet
 

1427
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,750
obviously child a child has not yet
accumulated knowledge and yet the great

1428
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:38,760
accumulated knowledge and yet the great
 

1429
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,690
accumulated knowledge and yet the great
ones are on record saying that a child

1430
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:41,700
ones are on record saying that a child
 

1431
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,610
ones are on record saying that a child
has a capacity

1432
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:43,620
has a capacity
 

1433
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,890
has a capacity
to to create

1434
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:45,900
to to create
 

1435
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,169
to to create
and at an adult

1436
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:48,179
and at an adult
 

1437
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:50,930
and at an adult
credits the inner child the inner child

1438
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:50,940
credits the inner child the inner child
 

1439
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,830
credits the inner child the inner child
yeah for this capacity to create as an

1440
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:54,840
yeah for this capacity to create as an
 

1441
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,409
yeah for this capacity to create as an
adult you see that's kind of weird if we

1442
00:28:57,409 --> 00:28:57,419
adult you see that's kind of weird if we
 

1443
00:28:57,419 --> 00:28:58,789
adult you see that's kind of weird if we
take the point of view

1444
00:28:58,789 --> 00:28:58,799
take the point of view
 

1445
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,430
take the point of view
that everything is computation

1446
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:01,440
that everything is computation
 

1447
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,409
that everything is computation
everything is accumulation of knowledge

1448
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:03,419
everything is accumulation of knowledge
 

1449
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:05,750
everything is accumulation of knowledge
that just bigger and bigger data sets

1450
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:05,760
that just bigger and bigger data sets
 

1451
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,810
that just bigger and bigger data sets
finer and finer neural networks and then

1452
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:08,820
finer and finer neural networks and then
 

1453
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,730
finer and finer neural networks and then
we will be able to replicate human

1454
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:10,740
we will be able to replicate human
 

1455
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,470
we will be able to replicate human

00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:20,750
problems all of that compressed so we
live we're each individual ants we only

live we're each individual ants we only
 

1657
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,789
live we're each individual ants we only
have like we have a family we interact

1658
00:33:22,789 --> 00:33:22,799
have like we have a family we interact
 

1659
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,490

1665
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:35,810
report of humanity and that's the beauty
of it so I embrace it but I wonder I'm

1666
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:35,820
of it so I embrace it but I wonder I'm
 

1667
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,870
of it so I embrace it but I wonder I'm
very impressed by it I wonder if

1668
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:38,880
very impressed by it I wonder if
 

1669
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,710
very impressed by it I wonder if
they can be very impressive meaning

1670
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:42,720
they can be very impressive meaning
 

1671
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,970
they can be very impressive meaning
way more impressive in being able to

1672
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:45,980
way more impressive in being able to
 

1673
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,950
way more impressive in being able to
fake or simulate or emulate a human

1674
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:48,960
fake or simulate or emulate a human
 

1675
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,470
fake or simulate or emulate a human
right I'm glad you mentioned that

1676
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:51,480
right I'm glad you mentioned that
 

1677
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,210
right I'm glad you mentioned that
because that's just it seems to be the

1678
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:53,220
because that's just it seems to be the
 

1679
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,850
because that's just it seems to be the
Mantra it's just fake fake it till you

1680
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:55,860
Mantra it's just fake fake it till you
 

1681
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,889
Mantra it's just fake fake it till you
make it yeah isn't it isn't that what we

1682
00:33:57,889 --> 00:33:57,899
make it yeah isn't it isn't that what we
 

1683
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:00,649
make it yeah isn't it isn't that what we
all do though no well yes we do that but

1684
00:34:00,649 --> 00:34:00,659
all do though no well yes we do that but
 

1685
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:03,649
all do though no well yes we do that but
we also do other things we can be truly

1686
00:34:03,649 --> 00:34:03,659
we also do other things we can be truly
 

1687
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:05,990
we also do other things we can be truly
in love we can be truly inspired when it

1688
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,000
in love we can be truly inspired when it
 

1689
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,850
in love we can be truly inspired when it
is not fake I do believe call me a

1690
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:07,860
is not fake I do believe call me a
 

1691
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,190
is not fake I do believe call me a
romantic okay but I do believe

1692
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:10,200
romantic okay but I do believe
 

1693
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,990
romantic okay but I do believe
and this is a very good I'm glad you're

1694
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:12,000
and this is a very good I'm glad you're
 

1695
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,190
and this is a very good I'm glad you're
putting it in these terms because I've

1696
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:13,200
putting it in these terms because I've
 

1697
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,889
putting it in these terms because I've
had conversations like that that yeah

1698
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:15,899
had conversations like that that yeah
 

1699
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:17,570
had conversations like that that yeah
fake it till you make it but that's like

1700
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:17,580
fake it till you make it but that's like
 

1701
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,970
fake it till you make it but that's like
that's what humans do yes we do that but

1702
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:19,980
that's what humans do yes we do that but
 

1703
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,250
that's what humans do yes we do that but
not all the time so and that is

1704
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:22,260
not all the time so and that is
 

1705
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,770
not all the time so and that is
debatable because also I speak from my

1706
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:24,780
debatable because also I speak from my
 

1707
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,389
debatable because also I speak from my
own experience and that's where the

1708
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:26,399
own experience and that's where the
 

1709
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,550
own experience and that's where the
first person perspective comes in the

1710
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:28,560
first person perspective comes in the
 

1711
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,310
first person perspective comes in the
subjective view I cannot prove to you

1712
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:31,320
subjective view I cannot prove to you
 

1713
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,669
subjective view I cannot prove to you
for instance or anyone else that there

1714
00:34:34,669 --> 00:34:34,679
for instance or anyone else that there
 

1715
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,530
for instance or anyone else that there
are certain moments in my life where I

1716
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:36,540
are certain moments in my life where I
 

1717
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,129
are certain moments in my life where I
am genuine I am pure so to speak when

1718
00:34:40,129 --> 00:34:40,139
am genuine I am pure so to speak when
 

1719
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:43,849
am genuine I am pure so to speak when
it's not faking it but I do I do have a

00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:43,859
it's not faking it but I do I do have a

tremendous
a certainty of it and that's a

1724
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:47,580
a certainty of it and that's a
 

1725
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:50,869
a certainty of it and that's a
subjective certainty now I am as a

so so in that sense you see how these
 

1833

so so in that sense you see how these

00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:57,780
um it was a hardcore scientist who
 

1877
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,810
um it was a hardcore scientist who
actually developed I think one of the

always say that's not the case

00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,410
always say that's not the case
but why should we

but why should we
 

1891
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,569
but why should we
from the outset

00:38:17,569 --> 00:38:17,579
from the outset
 

1893
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:19,790
from the outset
exclude this possibility that there is

um what I'm trying to do is to shake a
 

1903
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:31,130
um what I'm trying to do is to shake a
little bit the debate because most

00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:31,140
little bit the debate because most
 

1905
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,589
little bit the debate because most
mathematicians that I know and computer

1906
00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:33,599
mathematicians that I know and computer
 

1907
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,630
mathematicians that I know and computer
scientists even more so they're kind of

1908
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:35,640
scientists even more so they're kind of
 

1909
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,450
scientists even more so they're kind of
already sold on this

1910
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:38,460
already sold on this
 

1911
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,849
already sold on this
um we are just you know reminds me of

1912
00:38:40,849 --> 00:38:40,859
um we are just you know reminds me of
 

1913
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:43,250
um we are just you know reminds me of
this famous Lord kelvin's quote from the

1914
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:43,260
this famous Lord kelvin's quote from the
 

1915
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,010
this famous Lord kelvin's quote from the
end of 19th century

1916
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:45,020
end of 19th century
 

1917
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,030
end of 19th century
there's some debate whether he actually

1918
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:47,040
there's some debate whether he actually
 

1919
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,770
there's some debate whether he actually
said that but

1920
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:48,780
said that but
 

1921
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:52,990
said that but
never let a good story you know

1922
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:53,000

 

1923
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,630

he said physics is basically finished

1924
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:56,640
he said physics is basically finished
 

1925
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,329
he said physics is basically finished
yeah All That Remains is more more

1926
00:38:59,329 --> 00:38:59,339
yeah All That Remains is more more
 

1927
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:02,210
yeah All That Remains is more more
precise measurement so I find a lot of

1928
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:02,220
precise measurement so I find a lot of
 

1929
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,310
precise measurement so I find a lot of
my colleagues are happy to say

1930
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:04,320
my colleagues are happy to say
 

1931
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,050
my colleagues are happy to say
yeah everything's finished we already

went through the pattern will change and
it will look like the particles so

00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:27,410
it will look like the particles so
that's a very concrete realization of

that's a very concrete realization of

00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,569
that's a very concrete realization of
the idea that depending on how we set up

00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:08,630
concoction of of a of a Madman this is
our scientific theory which has been

our scientific theory which has been

00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,370
our scientific theory which has been
confirmed by experiment so we should pay

confirmed by experiment so we should pay
 

2403
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,470
confirmed by experiment so we should pay

00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:15,240
um self-imposed limitation unfortunately
 

2409
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,089
um self-imposed limitation unfortunately
in this case there is a big issue of

2410
00:48:17,089 --> 00:48:17,099
in this case there is a big issue of
 

2411
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:18,410
in this case there is a big issue of
Education

2412
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:18,420
Education
 

2413
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,690
Education
so a lot of people are not aware of it

2414
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:20,700
so a lot of people are not aware of it
 

2415
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,370
so a lot of people are not aware of it
through no fault of their own because

2416
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:22,380
through no fault of their own because
 

2417
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,109
through no fault of their own because
they were never properly taught that

2418
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:24,119
they were never properly taught that
 

2419
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:26,450
they were never properly taught that
because our system is broken education

2420
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:26,460
because our system is broken education
 

2421
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:28,790
because our system is broken education
system is broken especially in math

2422
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:28,800
system is broken especially in math
 

2423
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,010
system is broken especially in math
and then our so where do we get them do

2424
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:31,020
and then our so where do we get them do
 

2425
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,210
and then our so where do we get them do
you get information you get information

2437
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:45,109
um great thing that they do but a lot of
scientists somehow

2438
00:48:45,109 --> 00:48:45,119
scientists somehow
 

2439
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,290
scientists somehow
um when it comes to explaining the laws

2440
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:48,300
um when it comes to explaining the laws
 

2441
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,270
um when it comes to explaining the laws
of physics they are doing a fantastic

2442
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:50,280
of physics they are doing a fantastic

2445
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:55,309

um talking about this phenomenon for

00:48:55,309 --> 00:48:55,319
um talking about this phenomenon for
 

2447
00:48:55,319 --> 00:48:56,569
um talking about this phenomenon for
instance double slit experiments and

2448
00:48:56,569 --> 00:48:56,579
instance double slit experiments and
 

2449
00:48:56,579 --> 00:48:58,670
instance double slit experiments and
things like that but then you know

2450
00:48:58,670 --> 00:48:58,680
things like that but then you know
 

2451
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,829
things like that but then you know
interviewed by science managers in about

interviewed by science managers in about
 

2453
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:02,630
interviewed by science managers in about
three wheel and so on they revert back

00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:02,640
three wheel and so on they revert back
 

2455
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,809
three wheel and so on they revert back
to 19 19th century physics as if those

it's kind of scary I guess you know but
also what are the tools

2488
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:46,980
also what are the tools
 

2489
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:50,930
also what are the tools
with which we can talk about the

2490
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:50,940
with which we can talk about the
 

2491
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:52,790

the subjective view in reality what are

2494
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:56,160
the subjective view in reality what are
 

2495
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,750
the subjective view in reality what are
the tools of which we could talk about

2496
00:49:58,750 --> 00:49:58,760
the tools of which we could talk about
 

2497
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,130
the tools of which we could talk about
rigorously talk about Free Will and

2498
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:01,140
rigorously talk about Free Will and
 

2499
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:02,870
rigorously talk about Free Will and
Consciousness what are the tools of

2500
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:02,880
Consciousness what are the tools of
 

2501
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,609
Consciousness what are the tools of
mathematics that allow that I don't

2502
00:50:04,609 --> 00:50:04,619
mathematics that allow that I don't
 

2503
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:06,290
mathematics that allow that I don't
think we have those tools because we

2504
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:06,300
think we have those tools because we
 

2505
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,870
think we have those tools because we
haven't been taught properly so actually

2506
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:08,880
haven't been taught properly so actually
 

2507
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,750
haven't been taught properly so actually
tools are there for instance

2508
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:11,760
tools are there for instance
 

2509
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,250
tools are there for instance
um

2510
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:13,260
um
 

2511
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,750
um
I think well

2512
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:14,760
I think well
 

2513
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,670
I think well
here we have to

2514
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:16,680
here we have to
 

2515
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,010
here we have to
I have to say my conviction is that

2516
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:19,020
I have to say my conviction is that
 

2517
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:21,290
I have to say my conviction is that
everybody knows

2518
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:21,300
everybody knows
 

2519
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,930
everybody knows
in the heart of hearts everybody knows

in the heart of hearts everybody knows
 

2521
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:27,829
in the heart of hearts everybody knows
that there is that there is something

2522
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:27,839
that there is that there is something
 

2523
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:31,010
that there is that there is something
in our football there is something

2524
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:31,020
in our football there is something
 

2525
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:33,950
in our football there is something
mysterious and in fact you know

2526
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:33,960
mysterious and in fact you know
 

2527
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:37,309
mysterious and in fact you know
somehow immediately I feel that

2528
00:50:37,309 --> 00:50:37,319
somehow immediately I feel that
 

2529
00:50:37,319 --> 00:50:38,990
somehow immediately I feel that
um you know the impulse to quote

2530
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:39,000
um you know the impulse to quote
 

2531
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,910
um you know the impulse to quote
somebody on this because as if as if my

2532
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:40,920
somebody on this because as if as if my
 

2533
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,670
somebody on this because as if as if my
own opinion doesn't occur

2534
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:42,680
own opinion doesn't occur
 

2535
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,890
own opinion doesn't occur
there's a long dead expert that has when

2536
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:45,900
there's a long dead expert that has when
 

2537
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,470
there's a long dead expert that has when
Einstein said that he doesn't like how

2538
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:48,480
Einstein said that he doesn't like how
 

2539
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,349
Einstein said that he doesn't like how
see look at me I am supposed to do like

2540
00:50:51,349 --> 00:50:51,359
see look at me I am supposed to do like
 

2541
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,750
see look at me I am supposed to do like
this smart intelligent person

2542
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:53,760
this smart intelligent person
 

2543
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,089
this smart intelligent person
I am afraid to say it and own it myself

2544
00:50:56,089 --> 00:50:56,099
I am afraid to say it and own it myself
 

2545
00:50:56,099 --> 00:50:59,150
I am afraid to say it and own it myself
I have to find a confirmation I have to

2546
00:50:59,150 --> 00:50:59,160
I have to find a confirmation I have to
 

2547
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,910
I have to find a confirmation I have to
find an authority who agrees with me and

2548
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:01,920
find an authority who agrees with me and
 

2549
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,230
find an authority who agrees with me and
in fact it's not so difficult to find

2550
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:03,240
in fact it's not so difficult to find
 

2551
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,150
in fact it's not so difficult to find
because Albert Einstein literally said

2552
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:05,160
because Albert Einstein literally said
 

2553
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,430
because Albert Einstein literally said
the most important thing in life is the

2554
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:07,440
the most important thing in life is the
 

2555
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,230
the most important thing in life is the
mysterious okay he actually said that

2556
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:09,240
mysterious okay he actually said that
 

2557
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,910
mysterious okay he actually said that
there are some quotes which are

2558
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:10,920
there are some quotes which are
 

2559
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,130
there are some quotes which are
attributed to him which he never said

2560
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:13,140
attributed to him which he never said
 

2561
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:16,690
attributed to him which he never said
but this he did I investigated okay so

2562
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:16,700
but this he did I investigated okay so
 

2563
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,430
but this he did I investigated okay so
but more importantly you know

2564
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:19,440
but more importantly you know
 

2565
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,549
but more importantly you know
how do you feel about it

2566
00:51:22,549 --> 00:51:22,559
how do you feel about it
 

2567
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,950
how do you feel about it
um I think that everybody knows

2568
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:24,960
um I think that everybody knows
 

2569
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,290
um I think that everybody knows

00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,030
that you cannot have a square root of a
negative number why because if you had

negative number why because if you had
 

2643
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,589
negative number why because if you had
such a square root

can actually multi you can add them up

2888
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:38,700
can actually multi you can add them up
 

2889
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:41,510
can actually multi you can add them up
by adding um together the real parts and

2890
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:41,520
by adding um together the real parts and
 

2891
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,549
by adding um together the real parts and
imagining parts that's easy but there is

2892
00:57:43,549 --> 00:57:43,559
imagining parts that's easy but there is
 

2893
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:45,650
imagining parts that's easy but there is
also formula for the product for the

2894
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:45,660
also formula for the product for the
 

2895
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:47,630
also formula for the product for the
multiplication which uses the fact that

2896
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:47,640
multiplication which uses the fact that
 

2897
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,790
multiplication which uses the fact that
square root of minus 1 squared is minus

2898
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:49,800
square root of minus 1 squared is minus
 

2899
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:50,690
square root of minus 1 squared is minus
one

2900
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:50,700
one
 

2901
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:53,510
one
and the amazing thing is that that that

2902
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:53,520
and the amazing thing is that that that
 

2903
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,730
and the amazing thing is that that that
product that multiplication satisfies

2904
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:55,740
product that multiplication satisfies
 

2905
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:58,730
product that multiplication satisfies
the same rules the same properties that

the same rules the same properties that
 

2907
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:01,069
the same rules the same properties that
are usual operation of multiplication

2949
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,329
example you can try to do the same with
three-dimensional space so you have

2950
00:58:47,329 --> 00:58:47,339
three-dimensional space so you have
 

2951
00:58:47,339 --> 00:58:49,730
three-dimensional space so you have
coordinates x y and z

all directions
these are complex numbers and we can

2968
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:05,760
these are complex numbers and we can
 

2969
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,329
these are complex numbers and we can
Define addition and multiplication and

2970
00:59:08,329 --> 00:59:08,339
Define addition and multiplication and
 

2971
00:59:08,339 --> 00:59:09,770
Define addition and multiplication and
they will satisfy the same properties as

2972
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:09,780
they will satisfy the same properties as
 

2973
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,450
they will satisfy the same properties as
real numbers that we're used to what

2974
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:11,460
real numbers that we're used to what
 

2975
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:13,309
real numbers that we're used to what
about three-dimensional space is it

2976
00:59:13,309 --> 00:59:13,319
about three-dimensional space is it
 

2977
00:59:13,319 --> 00:59:16,010
about three-dimensional space is it
possible to also Define some operation

2978
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:16,020
possible to also Define some operation
 

2979
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,530
possible to also Define some operation
of addition and multiplication on it so

2980
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:18,540
of addition and multiplication on it so
 

2981
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:21,890
of addition and multiplication on it so
that the separations would satisfy the

2982
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:21,900
that the separations would satisfy the
 

2983
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,049
that the separations would satisfy the
properties that we're used to and the

2984
00:59:24,049 --> 00:59:24,059
properties that we're used to and the
 

2985
00:59:24,059 --> 00:59:26,270
properties that we're used to and the
answer is no you can Define addition but

2986
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:26,280
answer is no you can Define addition but
 

2987
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,950
answer is no you can Define addition but
you can't Define multiplication for

2988
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:27,960
you can't Define multiplication for
 

2989
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,270
you can't Define multiplication for
which there would be an inverse for

2990
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:29,280
which there would be an inverse for
 

2991
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,069
which there would be an inverse for
instance so there is something special

2992
00:59:31,069 --> 00:59:31,079
instance so there is something special
 

2993
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:33,230
instance so there is something special
about the the plane the two-dimensional

2994
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:33,240
about the the plane the two-dimensional
 

2995
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:36,289
about the the plane the two-dimensional
case and by the way uh next question

2996
00:59:36,289 --> 00:59:36,299
case and by the way uh next question
 

2997
00:59:36,299 --> 00:59:38,270
case and by the way uh next question
would be what about four-dimensional in

2998
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:38,280
would be what about four-dimensional in
 

2999
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,309
would be what about four-dimensional in
a four-dimensional space you again you

3000
00:59:40,309 --> 00:59:40,319
a four-dimensional space you again you
 

3001
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:43,549
a four-dimensional space you again you
can and you get what's called quotarians

3002
00:59:43,549 --> 00:59:43,559
can and you get what's called quotarians
 

3003
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:45,950
can and you get what's called quotarians

those numbers
 

3049
01:00:38,339 --> 01:00:40,490
those numbers
did we find The Theory of Everything no

3050
01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:40,500
did we find The Theory of Everything no
 

3051

eliminated which we couldn't see before

that's how I see the process of

that's how I see the process of

01:03:51,710 --> 01:03:51,720
mathematical one yes yes and I think
 

3205
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:55,549
mathematical one yes yes and I think
that

3206
01:03:55,549 --> 01:03:55,559

 

3207
01:03:55,559 --> 01:03:57,710

I think that it's still missing the mark

3208
01:03:57,710 --> 01:03:57,720
I think that it's still missing the mark
 

3209
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,930
I think that it's still missing the mark
in some sense because

3210
01:03:59,930 --> 01:03:59,940
in some sense because
 

3211
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:01,430
in some sense because
in fact

3212
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:01,440
in fact
 

3213
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,710
in fact
what I now think it's not it's not a

3214
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:03,720
what I now think it's not it's not a
 

3215
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,690
what I now think it's not it's not a
it's it's a paradoxical the question

3216
01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:05,700
it's it's a paradoxical the question
 

3217
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:07,849
it's it's a paradoxical the question
whether mathematics is

3218
01:04:07,849 --> 01:04:07,859
whether mathematics is
 

3219
01:04:07,859 --> 01:04:09,950
whether mathematics is
um invented or discovered whether there

3220
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:09,960
um invented or discovered whether there
 

3221
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:13,069
um invented or discovered whether there
is this world of pure forums and so on

3222
01:04:13,069 --> 01:04:13,079
is this world of pure forums and so on
 

3223
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:15,950
is this world of pure forums and so on
is another paradoxical question which

3224
01:04:15,950 --> 01:04:15,960
is another paradoxical question which
 

3225
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:18,710
is another paradoxical question which
doesn't have a simple answer

3226
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:18,720
doesn't have a simple answer
 

3227
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,990
doesn't have a simple answer
like whether electron is a particle or a

3228
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:21,000
like whether electron is a particle or a
 

3229
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,190
like whether electron is a particle or a
wave

3230
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:22,200
wave
 

3231
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:25,670
wave
from one point of view yes it's true

3232
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:25,680
from one point of view yes it's true
 

3233
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:26,930
from one point of view yes it's true
and

3234
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:26,940
and
 

3235
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:28,549
and
just the fact that so many

3236
01:04:28,549 --> 01:04:28,559
just the fact that so many
 

3237
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:30,349
just the fact that so many
mathematicians today actually subscribe

3238
01:04:30,349 --> 01:04:30,359
mathematicians today actually subscribe
 

3239
01:04:30,359 --> 01:04:32,450
mathematicians today actually subscribe
to this idea gives it the certain

3240
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:32,460
to this idea gives it the certain
 

3241
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:33,950
to this idea gives it the certain
credibility because that's what we feel

3242
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:33,960
credibility because that's what we feel
 

3243
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:36,950
credibility because that's what we feel
we do feel that we dive in to dive into

3244
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:36,960
we do feel that we dive in to dive into
 

3245

the very structured Minds keep where you
 

3249
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,650
the very structured Minds keep where you
know I wrote In Love In Math that um

3250
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:45,660
know I wrote In Love In Math that um
 

3251
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:47,750
know I wrote In Love In Math that um
you know the Enchanted Gardens of

3252
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:47,760
you know the Enchanted Gardens of
 

3253
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,789
you know the Enchanted Gardens of
platonic reality you know so where all

01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:52,309
platonic reality you know so where all
this fruit uh is grows you know and then

3256
01:04:52,309 --> 01:04:52,319
this fruit uh is grows you know and then
 

3257
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:54,109
this fruit uh is grows you know and then
we we might think it gives you this sort

3258
01:04:54,109 --> 01:04:54,119
we we might think it gives you this sort
 

3259
01:04:54,119 --> 01:04:58,010
we we might think it gives you this sort
of romantic sense of an explorer and um

3260
01:04:58,010 --> 01:04:58,020
of romantic sense of an explorer and um
 

3261
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:01,309
of romantic sense of an explorer and um
someone may be stuck in a you know some

3262
01:05:01,309 --> 01:05:01,319
someone may be stuck in a you know some
 

3263
01:05:01,319 --> 01:05:04,250
someone may be stuck in a you know some
provincial town in Russia for instance

3264
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:04,260
provincial town in Russia for instance
 

3265
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:07,549
provincial town in Russia for instance
but have the sense of Magellan you know

3266
01:05:07,549 --> 01:05:07,559
but have the sense of Magellan you know
 

3267
01:05:07,559 --> 01:05:09,650
but have the sense of Magellan you know
of traveling around the world it's just

3268
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:09,660
of traveling around the world it's just
 

3269
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:11,630
of traveling around the world it's just
not in the world that we usually think

3270
01:05:11,630 --> 01:05:11,640
not in the world that we usually think
 

3271
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:12,770
not in the world that we usually think
of

3272
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:12,780
of
 

3273
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:15,349
of
so it's it's one point of view but the

3274
01:05:15,349 --> 01:05:15,359
so it's it's one point of view but the
 

3275
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:17,270
so it's it's one point of view but the
other point of view is that yes it is a

3276
01:05:17,270 --> 01:05:17,280
other point of view is that yes it is a
 

3277
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,010
other point of view is that yes it is a
human process of course it is I mean it

3278
01:05:19,010 --> 01:05:19,020
human process of course it is I mean it
 

3279
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:20,750
human process of course it is I mean it
is you cannot deny that it's human

3280
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:20,760
is you cannot deny that it's human
 

3281
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:23,210
is you cannot deny that it's human
beings who have so far discovered new

3282
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:23,220
beings who have so far discovered new
 

3283
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:25,309
beings who have so far discovered new
mathematics and I do not deny the

3284
01:05:25,309 --> 01:05:25,319
mathematics and I do not deny the
 

3285
01:05:25,319 --> 01:05:27,530
mathematics and I do not deny the
possibility that a computer programs

3286
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:27,540
possibility that a computer programs
 

3287
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:29,230
possibility that a computer programs
will be able to discover new mathematics

3288
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:29,240
will be able to discover new mathematics
 

3289
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:33,170
will be able to discover new mathematics
but so far it's been humans so it

3290
01:05:33,170 --> 01:05:33,180
but so far it's been humans so it
 

3291
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:36,289
but so far it's been humans so it
whatever it is uh whether it's

3292
01:05:36,289 --> 01:05:36,299
whatever it is uh whether it's
 

3293
01:05:36,299 --> 01:05:38,510
whatever it is uh whether it's
discovered or invented it is a human

3294
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:38,520
discovered or invented it is a human
 

3295
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:42,109
discovered or invented it is a human
activity what that the possibility that

3296
01:05:42,109 --> 01:05:42,119
activity what that the possibility that
 

3297
01:05:42,119 --> 01:05:44,990
activity what that the possibility that
paradoxes are actually fundamental right

3298
01:05:44,990 --> 01:05:45,000
paradoxes are actually fundamental right
 

3299
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,210
paradoxes are actually fundamental right
to reality right and really really

3300
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:47,220
to reality right and really really
 

3301
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:49,490
to reality right and really really
internalizing that that we exist in a

3302
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:49,500
internalizing that that we exist in a
 

3303
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:52,849
internalizing that that we exist in a
world of not forms but of paradoxes

3304
01:05:52,849 --> 01:05:52,859
world of not forms but of paradoxes
 

3305
01:05:52,859 --> 01:05:56,030
world of not forms but of paradoxes
Bingo and so it's like what I said what

3306
01:05:56,030 --> 01:05:56,040
Bingo and so it's like what I said what
 

3307
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:59,089
Bingo and so it's like what I said what
the world but if you think it's weird

3308
01:05:59,089 --> 01:05:59,099
the world but if you think it's weird
 

3309
01:05:59,099 --> 01:06:01,130
the world but if you think it's weird
and I agree with you as the recovering

3310
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:01,140
and I agree with you as the recovering
 

3311
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:04,309
and I agree with you as the recovering
uh addict to knowledge yeah you know but

3312
01:06:04,309 --> 01:06:04,319
uh addict to knowledge yeah you know but
 

3313
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:05,990
uh addict to knowledge yeah you know but
I am liking it more and more because

3314
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:06,000
I am liking it more and more because
 

3315
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,030
I am liking it more and more because
there's so much freedom in it

3316
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:08,040
there's so much freedom in it
 

3317
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,549
there's so much freedom in it
uh and like like Niels Bohr said you

3318
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:10,559
uh and like like Niels Bohr said you
 

3319
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,950
uh and like like Niels Bohr said you
know I quote that earlier

3320
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:12,960
know I quote that earlier
 

3321
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:16,370
know I quote that earlier
the the opposite of a great truth is

3322
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:16,380
the the opposite of a great truth is
 

3323
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:20,150
the the opposite of a great truth is
another great truth he's pointing out to

3324
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:20,160
another great truth he's pointing out to
 

3325
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,829
another great truth he's pointing out to
this fact that

3326
01:06:21,829 --> 01:06:21,839
this fact that
 

3327
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:24,349
this fact that
you know and he also said that some some

3328
01:06:24,349 --> 01:06:24,359
you know and he also said that some some
 

3329
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:25,789
you know and he also said that some some
things in quantum physics are so

3330
01:06:25,789 --> 01:06:25,799
things in quantum physics are so
 

3331
01:06:25,799 --> 01:06:27,170
things in quantum physics are so
complicated the only way you can speak

3332
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:27,180
complicated the only way you can speak
 

3333
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:29,930
complicated the only way you can speak
of them is in poetry

3334
01:06:29,930 --> 01:06:29,940
of them is in poetry
 

3335
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:32,029
of them is in poetry
so in other words what is it about

3336
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:32,039
so in other words what is it about
 

3337
01:06:32,039 --> 01:06:35,150
so in other words what is it about
poetry what is about art why are we so

3338
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:35,160
poetry what is about art why are we so
 

3339
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:37,069
poetry what is about art why are we so
drawn to that why are we so captivated

3340
01:06:37,069 --> 01:06:37,079
drawn to that why are we so captivated
 

3341
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:41,450
drawn to that why are we so captivated
captivated by by those forms of by they

3342
01:06:41,450 --> 01:06:41,460
captivated by by those forms of by they
 

3343
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:43,130
captivated by by those forms of by they
are not intellectual necessarily they

3344
01:06:43,130 --> 01:06:43,140
are not intellectual necessarily they
 

3345
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:45,470
are not intellectual necessarily they
are not when you look at the painting

3346
01:06:45,470 --> 01:06:45,480
are not when you look at the painting
 

3347
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,450
are not when you look at the painting
that you like when you listen to music

3348
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:47,460
that you like when you listen to music
 

3349
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:49,789
that you like when you listen to music
that you love you get lost in it you get

3350
01:06:49,789 --> 01:06:49,799
that you love you get lost in it you get
 

3351
01:06:49,799 --> 01:06:51,410
that you love you get lost in it you get
absorbed in it it makes it make you cry

3352
01:06:51,410 --> 01:06:51,420
absorbed in it it makes it make you cry
 

3353
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:53,170
absorbed in it it makes it make you cry
it can make you laugh it can make you

3354
01:06:53,170 --> 01:06:53,180
it can make you laugh it can make you
 

3355
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:56,750
it can make you laugh it can make you
remember something it can make you feel

3356
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:56,760
remember something it can make you feel
 

3357
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,970
remember something it can make you feel
more confident or can make you feel sad

3358
01:06:58,970 --> 01:06:58,980
more confident or can make you feel sad
 

3359
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:01,130
more confident or can make you feel sad
or happy and so on what is this all

3360
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:01,140
or happy and so on what is this all
 

3361
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:01,970
or happy and so on what is this all
about

3362
01:07:01,970 --> 01:07:01,980
about
 

3363
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:05,089
about
is it really is just some play between

3364
01:07:05,089 --> 01:07:05,099
is it really is just some play between
 

3365
01:07:05,099 --> 01:07:07,549
is it really is just some play between
some kind of like silophone play or some

3366
01:07:07,549 --> 01:07:07,559
some kind of like silophone play or some
 

3367
01:07:07,559 --> 01:07:09,770
some kind of like silophone play or some
neurons or hitting on each other is it

3368
01:07:09,770 --> 01:07:09,780
neurons or hitting on each other is it
 

3369
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:12,529
neurons or hitting on each other is it
really that only maybe

3370
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:12,539
really that only maybe
 

3371
01:07:12,539 --> 01:07:15,410
really that only maybe
it could be it could be both I'm just

3372
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:15,420
it could be it could be both I'm just
 

3373
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:17,690
it could be it could be both I'm just
worried about kids these days that might

3374
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:17,700
worried about kids these days that might
 

3375
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,930
worried about kids these days that might
live in a world of paradoxes you know if

3376
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:20,940
live in a world of paradoxes you know if
 

3377
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:22,490
live in a world of paradoxes you know if
there's no God everything is possible

3378
01:07:22,490 --> 01:07:22,500
there's no God everything is possible
 

3379
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,289
there's no God everything is possible
and yet just they'll have a little too

3380
01:07:24,289 --> 01:07:24,299
and yet just they'll have a little too
 

3381
01:07:24,299 --> 01:07:26,809
and yet just they'll have a little too
much fun and we have to put a constraint

3382
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:26,819
much fun and we have to put a constraint
 

3383
01:07:26,819 --> 01:07:28,190
much fun and we have to put a constraint
because have you looked at the world

3384
01:07:28,190 --> 01:07:28,200
because have you looked at the world
 

3385
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:31,130
because have you looked at the world
lately I haven't checked in in a while

3386
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:31,140
lately I haven't checked in in a while
 

3387
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:33,890
lately I haven't checked in in a while
you think it's perfect the way it is now

3388
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:33,900
you think it's perfect the way it is now
 

3389
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:36,650
you think it's perfect the way it is now
the world without paradoxes the more

3390
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:36,660
the world without paradoxes the more
 

3391
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:38,270
the world without paradoxes the more
than which we believe that every end

3392
01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:38,280
than which we believe that every end
 

3393
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:41,029
than which we believe that every end
every question can be answered as yes or

3394
01:07:41,029 --> 01:07:41,039
every question can be answered as yes or
 

3395
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:43,609
every question can be answered as yes or
no that it is this or that and if you

3396
01:07:43,609 --> 01:07:43,619
no that it is this or that and if you
 

3397
01:07:43,619 --> 01:07:45,770
no that it is this or that and if you
disagree with me you're my enemy

3398
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:45,780
disagree with me you're my enemy
 

3399
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:48,049
disagree with me you're my enemy
wouldn't that be interesting if this

3400
01:07:48,049 --> 01:07:48,059
wouldn't that be interesting if this
 

3401
01:07:48,059 --> 01:07:50,630
wouldn't that be interesting if this
21st century is a transition into

3402
01:07:50,630 --> 01:07:50,640
21st century is a transition into
 

3403
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,789
21st century is a transition into
singing the world as well the paradoxes

3404
01:07:52,789 --> 01:07:52,799
singing the world as well the paradoxes
 

3405
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:54,710
singing the world as well the paradoxes
and tell you you know people predicted

3406
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:54,720
and tell you you know people predicted
 

3407
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,450
and tell you you know people predicted
that you know the age of Aquarius you

3408
01:07:56,450 --> 01:07:56,460
that you know the age of Aquarius you
 

3409
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:58,910
that you know the age of Aquarius you
know the excess of the of the Earth is

3410
01:07:58,910 --> 01:07:58,920
know the excess of the of the Earth is
 

3411
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:01,250
know the excess of the of the Earth is
rotating uh relative to the plane in

3412
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:01,260
rotating uh relative to the plane in
 

3413
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:03,349
rotating uh relative to the plane in
which the earth goes around the sun and

3414
01:08:03,349 --> 01:08:03,359
which the earth goes around the sun and
 

3415
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:05,930
which the earth goes around the sun and
the period of this revolution is around

3416
01:08:05,930 --> 01:08:05,940
the period of this revolution is around
 

3417
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:07,430
the period of this revolution is around
2000 years

3418
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:07,440
2000 years
 

3419
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,130
2000 years
so there is a traditional uh way of

3420
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:10,140
so there is a traditional uh way of
 

3421
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:12,170
so there is a traditional uh way of
measuring that by this

3422
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:12,180
measuring that by this
 

3423
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:14,930
measuring that by this
eras you know the the ages so the

3424
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:14,940
eras you know the the ages so the
 

3425
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:16,610
eras you know the the ages so the
previous one is called the age of Pisces

3426
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:16,620
previous one is called the age of Pisces
 

3427
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:19,249
previous one is called the age of Pisces
because of the constellation of Isis

3428
01:08:19,249 --> 01:08:19,259
because of the constellation of Isis
 

3429
01:08:19,259 --> 01:08:22,249
because of the constellation of Isis
that it points to so to speak you know

3430
01:08:22,249 --> 01:08:22,259
that it points to so to speak you know
 

3431
01:08:22,259 --> 01:08:25,189
that it points to so to speak you know
and now it's it's you know as in famous

3432
01:08:25,189 --> 01:08:25,199
and now it's it's you know as in famous
 

3433
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:27,050
and now it's it's you know as in famous
musical hair they said the age of

3434
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:27,060
musical hair they said the age of
 

3435
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:28,849
musical hair they said the age of
Aquarius is upon us

3436
01:08:28,849 --> 01:08:28,859
Aquarius is upon us
 

3437
01:08:28,859 --> 01:08:30,650
Aquarius is upon us
so the different people dated

3438
01:08:30,650 --> 01:08:30,660
so the different people dated
 

3439
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:32,090
so the different people dated
differently but

3440
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:32,100
differently but
 

3441
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:34,669
differently but
um some somewhere around the time where

3442
01:08:34,669 --> 01:08:34,679
um some somewhere around the time where
 

3443
01:08:34,679 --> 01:08:37,309
um some somewhere around the time where
we are finding ourselves how interesting

3444
01:08:37,309 --> 01:08:37,319
we are finding ourselves how interesting
 

3445
01:08:37,319 --> 01:08:41,150
we are finding ourselves how interesting
right is all the strife and all them

3446
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:41,160
right is all the strife and all them
 

3447
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:43,249
right is all the strife and all them
difficulties the world is experiencing

3448
01:08:43,249 --> 01:08:43,259
difficulties the world is experiencing
 

3449
01:08:43,259 --> 01:08:46,430
difficulties the world is experiencing
this might actually be the transition to

3450
01:08:46,430 --> 01:08:46,440
this might actually be the transition to
 

3451
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:48,470
this might actually be the transition to
something more harmonious wouldn't it be

3452
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:48,480
something more harmonious wouldn't it be
 

3453
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:51,530
something more harmonious wouldn't it be
nice it's also interesting that people

3454
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:51,540
nice it's also interesting that people
 

3455
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:53,570
nice it's also interesting that people
from long ago are able to predict

3456
01:08:53,570 --> 01:08:53,580
from long ago are able to predict
 

3457
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:56,990
from long ago are able to predict
certain things it's uh

3458
01:08:56,990 --> 01:08:57,000
certain things it's uh
 

3459
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,510
certain things it's uh
and it's almost like from long ago and

3460
01:08:59,510 --> 01:08:59,520
and it's almost like from long ago and
 

3461
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:02,150
and it's almost like from long ago and
you've talked about this with uh with uh

3462
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:02,160
you've talked about this with uh with uh
 

3463
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:05,809
you've talked about this with uh with uh
uh Pythagoras

3464
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:05,819
uh Pythagoras
 

3465
01:09:05,819 --> 01:09:07,490
uh Pythagoras
that

3466
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:07,500
that
 

3467
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:10,430
that
it seems that they they had a deep sense

3468
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:10,440
it seems that they they had a deep sense
 

3469
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:13,370
it seems that they they had a deep sense
of truth that's right for me it's all

3470
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:13,380
of truth that's right for me it's all
 

3471
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:16,070
of truth that's right for me it's all
this even even now so it's not just a

3472
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:16,080
this even even now so it's not just a
 

3473
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,590
this even even now so it's not just a
linear trajectory of an expanding

3474
01:09:18,590 --> 01:09:18,600
linear trajectory of an expanding
 

3475
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:21,110
linear trajectory of an expanding
knowledge there's a deep truth that

3476
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:21,120
knowledge there's a deep truth that
 

3477
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,510
knowledge there's a deep truth that
permeates the whole thing yes so that's

3478
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:23,520
permeates the whole thing yes so that's
 

3479
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,070
permeates the whole thing yes so that's
how I see it actually I you know I gave

3480
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:25,080
how I see it actually I you know I gave
 

3481
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:27,530
how I see it actually I you know I gave
a talk about Pythagoras and pythagoreans

3482
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:27,540
a talk about Pythagoras and pythagoreans
 

3483
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:29,809
a talk about Pythagoras and pythagoreans
just a few weeks ago at the Commonwealth

3484
01:09:29,809 --> 01:09:29,819
just a few weeks ago at the Commonwealth
 

3485
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:32,630
just a few weeks ago at the Commonwealth
Club of California in San Francisco

3486
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:32,640
Club of California in San Francisco
 

3487
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,789
Club of California in San Francisco
and because of that I did a kind of a

3488
01:09:34,789 --> 01:09:34,799
and because of that I did a kind of a
 

3489
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:37,930
and because of that I did a kind of a
deep dive into the subject and I I I

3490
01:09:37,930 --> 01:09:37,940
deep dive into the subject and I I I
 

3491
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:40,010
deep dive into the subject and I I I
learned that I actually totally

3492
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:40,020
learned that I actually totally
 

3493
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:41,510
learned that I actually totally
misunderstood Pythagoras and

3494
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:41,520
misunderstood Pythagoras and
 

3495
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,070
misunderstood Pythagoras and
pythagoreans that they were much deeper

3496
01:09:43,070 --> 01:09:43,080
pythagoreans that they were much deeper
 

3497
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:44,570
pythagoreans that they were much deeper
than I thought

3498
01:09:44,570 --> 01:09:44,580
than I thought
 

3499
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:46,550
than I thought
because you know most of us remember

3500
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:46,560
because you know most of us remember
 

3501
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:49,610
because you know most of us remember

Theorem about the right triangles
we also know that pythagoreans were

3506
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:55,800
we also know that pythagoreans were
 

3507
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:58,490
we also know that pythagoreans were
instrumental in introducing the tuning

uh did you not quite have the the

uh did you not quite have the the
Copernicus model with the sun in the

Copernicus model with the sun in the
 

3585
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,729
Copernicus model with the sun in the

middle they had what they call the
 

3587
01:11:34,739 --> 01:11:36,950

planets and the Sun were evolving around
 

3591
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,350
planets and the Sun were evolving around
oh around the central fire or Earth they

oh around the central fire or Earth they
 

3593
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:43,550
oh around the central fire or Earth they
call it Earth

3594

Earth was at the center so how could
they come up with this idea

3604
01:11:57,169 --> 01:11:57,179
they come up with this idea
 

3605
01:11:57,179 --> 01:12:00,530
they come up with this idea
the reason was in my opinion that for

3606
01:12:00,530 --> 01:12:00,540
the reason was in my opinion that for
 

3607
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:03,350
the reason was in my opinion that for
them the most movement of celestial

them the most movement of celestial
 

3609
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,229
them the most movement of celestial
bodies was like music in fact we call it

01:12:06,229 --> 01:12:06,239
bodies was like music in fact we call it
 

3611
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:08,510
bodies was like music in fact we call it

Symphony

3618
01:12:13,790 --> 01:12:13,800
Symphony
 

3619
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:16,550
Symphony
in which every being you know humans

3620
01:12:16,550 --> 01:12:16,560
in which every being you know humans
 

3621
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:17,750
in which every being you know humans
animals

3622
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:17,760
animals
 

3623
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,270
animals
but as well as the Earth and other

3624
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:20,280
but as well as the Earth and other
 

3625
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:21,770
but as well as the Earth and other
celestial bodies

3626
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:21,780
celestial bodies
 

3627
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:24,530
celestial bodies
were moving in harmony

3628
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:24,540
were moving in harmony
 

3629
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,090
were moving in harmony
like different notes of different

3630
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:26,100
like different notes of different
 

3631
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:28,310
like different notes of different
instruments in a symphony and so they

3632
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:28,320
instruments in a symphony and so they
 

3633
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:32,390
instruments in a symphony and so they
apply the same reasoning to the you know

3634
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:32,400
apply the same reasoning to the you know
 

3635
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,070
apply the same reasoning to the you know
the cosmological

3636
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:34,080
the cosmological
 

3637
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:37,669
the cosmological
model as they apply to the their model

3638
01:12:37,669 --> 01:12:37,679
model as they apply to the their model
 

3639
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:39,290
model as they apply to the their model
of music

3640
01:12:39,290 --> 01:12:39,300
of music
 

3641
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:42,110
of music
and from that perspective they could see

3642
01:12:42,110 --> 01:12:42,120
and from that perspective they could see
 

3643
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:43,189
and from that perspective they could see
things

3644
01:12:43,189 --> 01:12:43,199
things
 

3645
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:46,970
things
deeper than their contemporaries you see

3646
01:12:46,970 --> 01:12:46,980
deeper than their contemporaries you see
 

3647
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:49,370
deeper than their contemporaries you see
so in other words they saw mathematics

3648
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:49,380
so in other words they saw mathematics
 

3649
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:50,810
so in other words they saw mathematics
as a tool

3650
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:50,820
as a tool
 

3651
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:54,470
as a tool
but that tool was not limited to itself

3652
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:54,480
but that tool was not limited to itself
 

3653
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,630
but that tool was not limited to itself
and it was that they always they always

3654
01:12:56,630 --> 01:12:56,640
and it was that they always they always
 

3655
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,910
and it was that they always they always
knew that there is more and they knew

3656
01:12:58,910 --> 01:12:58,920
knew that there is more and they knew
 

3657
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:01,130
knew that there is more and they knew
also that every every pattern that you

3658
01:13:01,130 --> 01:13:01,140
also that every every pattern that you
 

3659
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:02,330
also that every every pattern that you
detect

3660
01:13:02,330 --> 01:13:02,340
detect
 

3661
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:04,610

it's finite but the world is infinite

3662
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:04,620
it's finite but the world is infinite
 

3663
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:06,290
it's finite but the world is infinite
they actually accepted Infinity they

3664
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:06,300
they actually accepted Infinity they
 

3665
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:08,450
they actually accepted Infinity they
believe that infants is real

3666
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:08,460
believe that infants is real
 

3667
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:12,169

and if you discern a pattern

3668
01:13:12,169 --> 01:13:12,179
and if you discern a pattern

01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,149
great you can play with it and you can
use that it gives you a certain lens

01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,050
could be beneficial for you to to learn
more and so on but they never had the

3680
01:13:27,050 --> 01:13:27,060
more and so on but they never had the
 

3681
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:28,610
more and so on but they never had the
illusion that that was the final word

3682
01:13:28,610 --> 01:13:28,620
illusion that that was the final word
 

3683
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:31,370
illusion that that was the final word
that they always knew that it's not the

3684
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:31,380
that they always knew that it's not the
 

3685
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:32,810
that they always knew that it's not the
whole thing so there is more there are

3686
01:13:32,810 --> 01:13:32,820
whole thing so there is more there are
 

3687
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:34,310
whole thing so there is more there are
more sophisticated patterns that could

3688
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:34,320
more sophisticated patterns that could
 

3689
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,870
more sophisticated patterns that could
be discovered using mathematics or

3690
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:35,880
be discovered using mathematics or
 

3691
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,729
be discovered using mathematics or
otherwise

3692
01:13:37,729 --> 01:13:37,739
otherwise
 

3693
01:13:37,739 --> 01:13:39,770
otherwise
and I think that what happened was we

3694
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:39,780
and I think that what happened was we
 

3695
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:41,990
and I think that what happened was we
kind of lost this this other side of

3696
01:13:41,990 --> 01:13:42,000
kind of lost this this other side of
 

3697
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,450
kind of lost this this other side of
their teachings we we took their numbers

3698
01:13:44,450 --> 01:13:44,460
their teachings we we took their numbers
 

3699
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:46,610
their teachings we we took their numbers
and they were like idea that you could

3700
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:46,620
and they were like idea that you could
 

3701
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:49,010
and they were like idea that you could
use mathematics to discern patterns and

3702
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:49,020
use mathematics to discern patterns and
 

3703
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:50,810
use mathematics to discern patterns and
to find regularities and to explain

3704
01:13:50,810 --> 01:13:50,820
to find regularities and to explain
 

3705
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:52,550
to find regularities and to explain
things about the world

3706
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:52,560
things about the world
 

3707
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,250
things about the world
we took that and we ran with it and we

3708
01:13:55,250 --> 01:13:55,260
we took that and we ran with it and we
 

3709
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:57,530
we took that and we ran with it and we
kind of dropped the other idea that in

3710
01:13:57,530 --> 01:13:57,540
kind of dropped the other idea that in
 

3711
01:13:57,540 --> 01:13:58,729
kind of dropped the other idea that in
fact

3712
01:13:58,729 --> 01:13:58,739
fact
 

3713
01:13:58,739 --> 01:14:01,070
fact
there is a there is another side to it

3714
01:14:01,070 --> 01:14:01,080
there is a there is another side to it
 

3715
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:04,970
there is a there is another side to it
which is kind of to us now

3716
01:14:04,970 --> 01:14:04,980
which is kind of to us now
 

3717
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:10,130
which is kind of to us now
we say oh that's mystical but

3718
01:14:10,130 --> 01:14:10,140
we say oh that's mystical but
 

3719
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:12,290
we say oh that's mystical but
what does it mean mystical if it is

3720
01:14:12,290 --> 01:14:12,300
what does it mean mystical if it is
 

3721
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,209
what does it mean mystical if it is
something that helps you to make great

3722
01:14:14,209 --> 01:14:14,219
something that helps you to make great
 

3723
01:14:14,219 --> 01:14:16,310
something that helps you to make great
discoveries and the interesting thing is

3724
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:16,320
discoveries and the interesting thing is
 

3725
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:17,750
discoveries and the interesting thing is
that the people who are in touch with

3726
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:17,760
that the people who are in touch with
 

3727
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:18,770
that the people who are in touch with
the mystical

3728
01:14:18,770 --> 01:14:18,780
the mystical
 

3729
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:20,410
the mystical
Among Us

3730
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:20,420
Among Us
 

3731
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:23,090
Among Us
often seen as mad

3732
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:23,100
often seen as mad
 

3733
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:26,870
often seen as mad
and many of them are most of them are

3734
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:26,880
and many of them are most of them are
 

3735
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,270
and many of them are most of them are
well but not all of them all of them we

3736
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:29,280
well but not all of them all of them we
 

3737
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,970
well but not all of them all of them we
mentioned you know spoor and Newton and

3738
01:14:31,970 --> 01:14:31,980
mentioned you know spoor and Newton and
 

3739
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:34,610
mentioned you know spoor and Newton and
Albert Einstein so but that's where the

3740
01:14:34,610 --> 01:14:34,620
Albert Einstein so but that's where the
 

3741
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:38,149
Albert Einstein so but that's where the
conundrum is how do you find the balance

3742
01:14:38,149 --> 01:14:38,159
conundrum is how do you find the balance
 

3743
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:40,910
conundrum is how do you find the balance
between the two so

3744
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:40,920
between the two so
 

3745
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:42,770
between the two so
the point I'm trying to make and you

3746
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:42,780
the point I'm trying to make and you
 

3747
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:45,169
the point I'm trying to make and you
know and this is what I feel

01:14:45,169 --> 01:14:45,179
know and this is what I feel
 

3749
01:14:45,179 --> 01:14:47,090
know and this is what I feel
you know if you ask me what I find most

3750
01:14:47,090 --> 01:14:47,100
you know if you ask me what I find most
 

3751

is this idea
 

3759
01:14:56,820 --> 01:14:58,790
is this idea
of balance

3760
01:14:58,790 --> 01:14:58,800
of balance
 

3761
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,890
of balance
so you know

3762
01:15:00,890 --> 01:15:00,900
so you know
 

3763
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:01,790

and he presented this
Theory which I think is kind of very

01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:12,300
Theory which I think is kind of very
 

3775
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:13,729
Theory which I think is kind of very
useful

3776
01:15:13,729 --> 01:15:13,739
useful

Dennis was also god of wine
so it's also that side of

so it's also that side of
 

3803

so it's also that side of
a human that makes us

the purpose of human life
is to find balance between them

3826

is to find balance between them
 

3827
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,709
is to find balance between them
because the math is

because the math is

both discovered and invented we should
 

3831
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:30,229
both discovered and invented we should
be okay with

like love so Geniuses in modern version
is love and math I returned to that

3842
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:45,840
is love and math I returned to that
 

3843
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,930
is love and math I returned to that
question we had about GPT and the

3844
01:16:47,930 --> 01:16:47,940
question we had about GPT and the
 

3845
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:51,050
question we had about GPT and the
language models and I think about this

3846
01:16:51,050 --> 01:16:51,060
language models and I think about this
 

3847
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:54,770
language models and I think about this
quite a lot which is when uh the model

3848
01:16:54,770 --> 01:16:54,780
quite a lot which is when uh the model
 

3849
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:57,709
quite a lot which is when uh the model
and we know what is trained on we know

3850
01:16:57,709 --> 01:16:57,719
and we know what is trained on we know
 

3851
01:16:57,719 --> 01:16:59,270
and we know what is trained on we know
the parameters

3852
01:16:59,270 --> 01:16:59,280
the parameters
 

3853
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,010
the parameters
when all the different hacks that are

3854
01:17:01,010 --> 01:17:01,020
when all the different hacks that are
 

3855
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:02,630
when all the different hacks that are
involved in the training process and the

3856
01:17:02,630 --> 01:17:02,640
involved in the training process and the
 

3857
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:05,450
involved in the training process and the
fine-tuning process

3858
01:17:05,450 --> 01:17:05,460
fine-tuning process
 

3859
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:08,810
fine-tuning process
and the final results well there's GPT

3860
01:17:08,810 --> 01:17:08,820
and the final results well there's GPT
 

3861
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:11,510
and the final results well there's GPT
five six or seven will result in

3862
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:11,520
five six or seven will result in
 

3863
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,970
five six or seven will result in
hundreds of millions of people falling

3864
01:17:13,970 --> 01:17:13,980
hundreds of millions of people falling
 

3865
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:15,770
hundreds of millions of people falling
deeply in love

3866
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:15,780
deeply in love
 

3867
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:17,870
deeply in love
with that language model and to be able

3868
01:17:17,870 --> 01:17:17,880
with that language model and to be able
 

3869
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:19,490
with that language model and to be able
to have conversations

3870
01:17:19,490 --> 01:17:19,500
to have conversations
 

3871
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:22,550
to have conversations
that are very much like the

3872
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:22,560
that are very much like the
 

3873
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:23,990
that are very much like the
conversations we have with somebody

3874
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:24,000
conversations we have with somebody
 

3875
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,209
conversations we have with somebody
we're deeply in love with and not only

3876
01:17:26,209 --> 01:17:26,219
we're deeply in love with and not only
 

3877
01:17:26,219 --> 01:17:28,370
we're deeply in love with and not only
that the model

3878
01:17:28,370 --> 01:17:28,380
that the model
 

3879
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:32,149
that the model
will say that is deeply in love with us

3880
01:17:32,149 --> 01:17:32,159
will say that is deeply in love with us
 

3881
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:36,410
will say that is deeply in love with us
and who are we to say it is not

3882
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:36,420

 

3883
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:39,169

I think there's a

3884
01:17:39,169 --> 01:17:39,179
I think there's a
 

3885
01:17:39,179 --> 01:17:41,090
I think there's a
it's the same imperative that you

3886
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:41,100
it's the same imperative that you
 

3887
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:43,250
it's the same imperative that you
described in the scientific mind

3888
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:43,260
described in the scientific mind
 

3889
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:45,590
described in the scientific mind
that wants to throw away the subjective

3890
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:45,600
that wants to throw away the subjective
 

3891
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:48,169
that wants to throw away the subjective
that same imperative wants to throw away

3892
01:17:48,169 --> 01:17:48,179
that same imperative wants to throw away
 

3893
01:17:48,179 --> 01:17:50,510
that same imperative wants to throw away
the feelings that AI might have

3894
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:50,520
the feelings that AI might have
 

3895
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:53,630
the feelings that AI might have
and I'm very careful

3896
01:17:53,630 --> 01:17:53,640
and I'm very careful
 

3897
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:57,410
and I'm very careful
to not ignore when an AI system says

3898
01:17:57,410 --> 01:17:57,420
to not ignore when an AI system says
 

3899
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:58,729
to not ignore when an AI system says
it's lonely

3900
01:17:58,729 --> 01:17:58,739
it's lonely
 

3901
01:17:58,739 --> 01:18:01,970
it's lonely
it's afraid it doesn't want to die it

3902
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:01,980
it's afraid it doesn't want to die it
 

3903

instance say that
 

3911
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:13,729
instance say that
um the origin of that

3912
01:18:13,729 --> 01:18:13,739
um the origin of that
 

3913
01:18:13,739 --> 01:18:16,669
um the origin of that
is the you know romantic novels that

3914
01:18:16,669 --> 01:18:16,679
is the you know romantic novels that
 

3915
01:18:16,679 --> 01:18:20,450
is the you know romantic novels that
overfed to it for instance yes however

overfed to it for instance yes however
 

3917
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:23,209
overfed to it for instance yes however
you could also then you can retort but

3918
01:18:23,209 --> 01:18:23,219
you could also then you can retort but
 

3919
01:18:23,219 --> 01:18:25,729
you could also then you can retort but
what if my what I consider my subjective

3920
01:18:25,729 --> 01:18:25,739
what if my what I consider my subjective
 

3921
01:18:25,739 --> 01:18:29,390
what if my what I consider my subjective
unique feelings are also novels the

3922
01:18:29,390 --> 01:18:29,400
unique feelings are also novels the
 

3923
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,610
unique feelings are also novels the
river preparations of the novels I have

3924
01:18:31,610 --> 01:18:31,620
river preparations of the novels I have
 

3925
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:33,350
river preparations of the novels I have
read because I have learned or movies I

3926
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:33,360
read because I have learned or movies I
 

3927
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:34,729
read because I have learned or movies I
have seen yeah because that's the

3928
01:18:34,729 --> 01:18:34,739
have seen yeah because that's the
 

3929
01:18:34,739 --> 01:18:36,350
have seen yeah because that's the
purpose of movies kind of to teach us

3930
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:36,360
purpose of movies kind of to teach us
 

3931
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:38,570

how to express ourselves how to feel

maybe even one could argue that some

3934
01:18:40,430 --> 01:18:40,440
maybe even one could argue that some
 

3935
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,169
maybe even one could argue that some
people have argued that

3936
01:18:42,169 --> 01:18:42,179
people have argued that
 

3937
01:18:42,179 --> 01:18:45,410
people have argued that
I agree that this is

3938
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:45,420
I agree that this is
 

3939
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:46,310
I agree that this is
um

3940
01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:46,320
um
 

3941
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:49,250
um
there is no obvious answer to this but

3942
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:49,260
there is no obvious answer to this but
 

3943
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:52,189
there is no obvious answer to this but
see that's exactly my point that is an

3944
01:18:52,189 --> 01:18:52,199
see that's exactly my point that is an
 

3945
01:18:52,199 --> 01:18:53,330
see that's exactly my point that is an
example of something which is

3946
01:18:53,330 --> 01:18:53,340
example of something which is
 

3947
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:54,709
example of something which is
paradoxical

3948
01:18:54,709 --> 01:18:54,719
paradoxical
 

3949
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:57,410
paradoxical
for which there is no answer and that's

3950
01:18:57,410 --> 01:18:57,420
for which there is no answer and that's
 

3951
01:18:57,420 --> 01:19:00,649
for which there is no answer and that's
where the subjective has a has an

3952
01:19:00,649 --> 01:19:00,659
where the subjective has a has an
 

3953
01:19:00,659 --> 01:19:03,350
where the subjective has a has an
important role for someone

3954
01:19:03,350 --> 01:19:03,360
important role for someone
 

3955
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:07,189
important role for someone
uh that type of interaction

3956
01:19:07,189 --> 01:19:07,199
uh that type of interaction
 

3957
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:10,370
uh that type of interaction
would be would be helpful would be

3958
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:10,380
would be would be helpful would be
 

3959
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:13,430
would be would be helpful would be
consoling would would feel would you

3960
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:13,440
consoling would would feel would you
 

3961
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:16,010
consoling would would feel would you
know make them happy or sad or whatever

3962
01:19:16,010 --> 01:19:16,020
know make them happy or sad or whatever
 

3963
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:18,770
know make them happy or sad or whatever
you know what kind of strike the nerve

3964
01:19:18,770 --> 01:19:18,780
you know what kind of strike the nerve
 

3965
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:20,689
you know what kind of strike the nerve
for some it won't

3966
01:19:20,689 --> 01:19:20,699
for some it won't
 

3967
01:19:20,699 --> 01:19:24,290
for some it won't
and I agree with you that in principle

3968
01:19:24,290 --> 01:19:24,300
and I agree with you that in principle
 

3969
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:26,870
and I agree with you that in principle
there is no one to to judge this this is

3970
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:26,880
there is no one to to judge this this is
 

3971
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,610
there is no one to to judge this this is
this is where subjective is Paramount

3972
01:19:28,610 --> 01:19:28,620
this is where subjective is Paramount
 

3973
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:30,110
this is where subjective is Paramount
but remember

3974
01:19:30,110 --> 01:19:30,120
but remember
 

3975
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:32,330
but remember
um a lot of this has been anticipated

3976
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:32,340
um a lot of this has been anticipated
 

3977
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:36,470
um a lot of this has been anticipated
by artists the great movie her there you

3978
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:36,480
by artists the great movie her there you
 

3979

isn't he doesn't have a partner he's
lonely and then he gets this sort of a

3988
01:19:49,370 --> 01:19:49,380
lonely and then he gets this sort of a
 

3989
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:52,070
lonely and then he gets this sort of a

part of the joy of having this Siri like

01:21:09,290 --> 01:21:09,300
part of the joy of having this Siri like
 

4049
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:10,910
part of the joy of having this Siri like
um relationship

4050
01:21:10,910 --> 01:21:10,920
um relationship
 

4051
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:14,149
um relationship
for him one could say was the absence of

4052
01:21:14,149 --> 01:21:14,159
for him one could say was the absence of
 

4053
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:16,790
for him one could say was the absence of
that fear that she would abandon him

4054
01:21:16,790 --> 01:21:16,800
that fear that she would abandon him
 

4055
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:20,090
that fear that she would abandon him
which prevented him from

4056
01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:20,100
which prevented him from
 

4057
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:22,550
which prevented him from
initiating a relationship with a human

4058
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:22,560
initiating a relationship with a human
 

4059
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:23,810
initiating a relationship with a human
being

4060
01:21:23,810 --> 01:21:23,820
being
 

4061
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:26,750
being
and yet it turns out that he could be

4062
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:26,760
and yet it turns out that he could be
 

4063
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:28,729
and yet it turns out that he could be
betrayed quote unquote that she could be

4064
01:21:28,729 --> 01:21:28,739
betrayed quote unquote that she could be
 

4065
01:21:28,739 --> 01:21:31,330
betrayed quote unquote that she could be
unfaithful to him quote unquote anyway

4066
01:21:31,330 --> 01:21:31,340
unfaithful to him quote unquote anyway
 

4067
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:34,610
unfaithful to him quote unquote anyway
so then that means that it did not

4068
01:21:34,610 --> 01:21:34,620
so then that means that it did not
 

4069
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:37,130
so then that means that it did not
resolve the underlying fear having that

4070
01:21:37,130 --> 01:21:37,140
resolve the underlying fear having that
 

4071
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:40,010
resolve the underlying fear having that
relationship so in other words that

4072
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:40,020
relationship so in other words that
 

4073
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:42,770
relationship so in other words that
human element of the relationship

4074
01:21:42,770 --> 01:21:42,780
human element of the relationship
 

4075
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:45,770
human element of the relationship
still found its way into the seemingly

01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:45,780

partnership so the human being rears its

4080
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:54,480
partnership so the human being rears its
 

4081
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:58,490
partnership so the human being rears its
head anyway and I think the lesson there

4082
01:21:58,490 --> 01:21:58,500
head anyway and I think the lesson there
 

4083
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:02,870
head anyway and I think the lesson there
is that the system in the movie Her

4084
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:02,880
is that the system in the movie Her
 

4085
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,950
is that the system in the movie Her
actually gave him a lesson that even AI

4086
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:06,960
actually gave him a lesson that even AI
 

4087
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,350
actually gave him a lesson that even AI
could betray you even if I can leave you

4088
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:09,360
could betray you even if I can leave you
 

4089
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:13,130
could betray you even if I can leave you
even AI can be uh unfaithful to you and

4090
01:22:13,130 --> 01:22:13,140
even AI can be uh unfaithful to you and
 

4091
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:16,490
even AI can be uh unfaithful to you and
I would argue that the next AI he meets

4092
01:22:16,490 --> 01:22:16,500
I would argue that the next AI he meets
 

4093
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:19,370
I would argue that the next AI he meets
will be one he actually falls in deep

4094
01:22:19,370 --> 01:22:19,380
will be one he actually falls in deep
 

4095
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:20,930
will be one he actually falls in deep
love with because he knows the

01:22:20,930 --> 01:22:20,940
love with because he knows the
 

4097
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:22,970
love with because he knows the
possibility of betrayal is there the

4098
01:22:22,970 --> 01:22:22,980
possibility of betrayal is there the
 

4099
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:24,709
possibility of betrayal is there the
possibility of death is there the

4100
01:22:24,709 --> 01:22:24,719
possibility of death is there the
 

4101
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:26,390
possibility of death is there the
possibility of infidelity is there

4102
01:22:26,390 --> 01:22:26,400
possibility of infidelity is there
 

4103
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:29,570
possibility of infidelity is there
because we need that possibility to

4104
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:29,580
because we need that possibility to
 

4105
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:32,390
because we need that possibility to

working a lot with quadrupeds recently
legged robots with four legs and

4160
01:23:44,750 --> 01:23:44,760
legged robots with four legs and
 

4161
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:48,050
legged robots with four legs and
the feelings I feel when I see

4162
01:23:48,050 --> 01:23:48,060
the feelings I feel when I see
 

4163
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:50,330
the feelings I feel when I see
uh you know I'm programming the thing

4164
01:23:50,330 --> 01:23:50,340
uh you know I'm programming the thing
 

4165
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:52,850
uh you know I'm programming the thing
but when the thing is excited to see me

4166
01:23:52,850 --> 01:23:52,860
but when the thing is excited to see me
 

4167
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:54,709
but when the thing is excited to see me
or shows with this physical movement

4168
01:23:54,709 --> 01:23:54,719
or shows with this physical movement
 

4169
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:57,050

not somehow fundamental to what it means
 

4175
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:06,290
not somehow fundamental to what it means
to program robots and I don't want to

4176
01:24:06,290 --> 01:24:06,300
to program robots and I don't want to
 

4177
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:08,330
to program robots and I don't want to
dismiss that and please don't please

4178
01:24:08,330 --> 01:24:08,340
dismiss that and please don't please
 

4179
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:10,130
dismiss that and please don't please
don't the robotics Community often

4180
01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:10,140
don't the robotics Community often
 

4181
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:12,770
don't the robotics Community often
doesn't gender robots they really try to

doesn't gender robots they really try to
 

4183
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:14,630

it can wiggle his butt it can turn
 

4201
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:33,830
it can wiggle his butt it can turn
around and look up yeah excited that's

4202
01:24:33,830 --> 01:24:33,840
around and look up yeah excited that's
 

4203
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,590
around and look up yeah excited that's
not just I know how it's programmed but

4204
01:24:36,590 --> 01:24:36,600
not just I know how it's programmed but
 

4205
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,570
not just I know how it's programmed but
the feeling I feel that's something

4206
01:24:38,570 --> 01:24:38,580
the feeling I feel that's something
 

4207

4211
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,689
agree with you I I hear you I hear you
when you speak about it yeah you speak

4212
01:24:44,689 --> 01:24:44,699
when you speak about it yeah you speak
 

4213
01:24:44,699 --> 01:24:46,669
when you speak about it yeah you speak
with passion yeah and that's

4214
01:24:46,669 --> 01:24:46,679
with passion yeah and that's
 

4215
01:24:46,679 --> 01:24:50,090
with passion yeah and that's
for me that is proof but it is magical

you see uh so don't I would say don't
 

4219
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:56,450
you see uh so don't I would say don't
dismiss that don't discard that on the

4220
01:24:56,450 --> 01:24:56,460
dismiss that don't discard that on the
 

4221
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:59,030
dismiss that don't discard that on the
contrary I think magic is everywhere you

4222
01:24:59,030 --> 01:24:59,040
contrary I think magic is everywhere you
 

4223
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,850
contrary I think magic is everywhere you
know so I used to be okay kind of

4224
01:25:01,850 --> 01:25:01,860
know so I used to be okay kind of
 

4225
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:05,209
know so I used to be okay kind of
confession okay

4226

4227
01:25:05,219 --> 01:25:06,890

you've already got confessed to quite a

4228
01:25:06,890 --> 01:25:06,900
you've already got confessed to quite a
 

4229
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:08,870
you've already got confessed to quite a
few addictions yeah I'm kind of uh yes

4230
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:08,880
few addictions yeah I'm kind of uh yes
 

4231
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:10,850
few addictions yeah I'm kind of uh yes
I'm kind of worried recover recovering

4232
01:25:10,850 --> 01:25:10,860
I'm kind of worried recover recovering
 

4233
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:13,970
I'm kind of worried recover recovering
for many but you know I

4234
01:25:13,970 --> 01:25:13,980
for many but you know I
 

4235
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:17,030
for many but you know I
in old days I was

4236
01:25:17,030 --> 01:25:17,040
in old days I was
 

4237
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:19,189
in old days I was
more on the side of everything is

4238
01:25:19,189 --> 01:25:19,199
more on the side of everything is
 

4239
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:21,290
more on the side of everything is
computational or everything can be

4240
01:25:21,290 --> 01:25:21,300
computational or everything can be
 

4241
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:23,270
computational or everything can be
explained by science and whatever you

4242
01:25:23,270 --> 01:25:23,280
explained by science and whatever you
 

4243
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:24,410
explained by science and whatever you
know like

4244
01:25:24,410 --> 01:25:24,420
know like
 

4245
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:26,570
know like
I would dismiss and disregard you know

4246
01:25:26,570 --> 01:25:26,580
I would dismiss and disregard you know
 

4247
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:29,330
I would dismiss and disregard you know
the intuitive or imaginative things so

4248
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:29,340
the intuitive or imaginative things so
 

4249
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:31,850
the intuitive or imaginative things so
then I had to flip that suddenly I start

4250
01:25:31,850 --> 01:25:31,860
then I had to flip that suddenly I start
 

4251
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:34,189
then I had to flip that suddenly I start
feeling it and started seeing it and so

4252
01:25:34,189 --> 01:25:34,199
feeling it and started seeing it and so
 

4253
01:25:34,199 --> 01:25:37,550
feeling it and started seeing it and so
on but so then the pendulums had swung

4254
01:25:37,550 --> 01:25:37,560
on but so then the pendulums had swung
 

4255
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:41,149
on but so then the pendulums had swung
in the opposite direction then I was

4256
01:25:41,149 --> 01:25:41,159
in the opposite direction then I was
 

4257
01:25:41,159 --> 01:25:44,090
in the opposite direction then I was
arguing uh

4258
01:25:44,090 --> 01:25:44,100
arguing uh
 

4259
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:47,270
arguing uh
that you know somehow that was the real

4260
01:25:47,270 --> 01:25:47,280
that you know somehow that was the real
 

4261
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:49,310
that you know somehow that was the real
that imagination was intuitive

4262
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:49,320
that imagination was intuitive
 

4263
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:52,810
that imagination was intuitive
imaginative was real and discounting

4264
01:25:52,810 --> 01:25:52,820
imaginative was real and discounting
 

4265
01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:55,490
imaginative was real and discounting
what you just described

4266
01:25:55,490 --> 01:25:55,500
what you just described
 

4267
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:57,830
what you just described
and I would argue with people saying no

4268
01:25:57,830 --> 01:25:57,840
and I would argue with people saying no
 

4269
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,930
and I would argue with people saying no
no this you know this is not real this

4270
01:25:59,930 --> 01:25:59,940
no this you know this is not real this
 

4271
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:02,870
no this you know this is not real this
is all you know imitation game and so on

4272
01:26:02,870 --> 01:26:02,880
is all you know imitation game and so on
 

4273
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:05,030
is all you know imitation game and so on
but you see that

4274
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:05,040
but you see that
 

4275
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:08,330
but you see that
what's new now the new advert okay is

4276
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:08,340
what's new now the new advert okay is
 

4277
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:11,990
what's new now the new advert okay is
the the 2.0 or 3.0 is the one who is

4278
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:12,000
the the 2.0 or 3.0 is the one who is
 

4279
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,229
the the 2.0 or 3.0 is the one who is
seeking balance who is not who is

4280
01:26:15,229 --> 01:26:15,239
seeking balance who is not who is
 

4281
01:26:15,239 --> 01:26:18,350
seeking balance who is not who is

so whereas even a couple of years ago

4288
01:26:25,129 --> 01:26:25,139
so whereas even a couple of years ago
 

4289
01:26:25,139 --> 01:26:27,709
so whereas even a couple of years ago
you know if you just told you told me

you know if you just told you told me
 

4291
01:26:27,719 --> 01:26:29,390
you know if you just told you told me
what you just described I would be like

4292
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:29,400
what you just described I would be like
 

4293

you know being polite I would just I
 

4295
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:33,110
you know being polite I would just I
wouldn't contradict you since you're the

4296
01:26:33,110 --> 01:26:33,120
wouldn't contradict you since you're the
 

4297
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:36,050
wouldn't contradict you since you're the
host anyway right it's not a lot so but

4298
01:26:36,050 --> 01:26:36,060
host anyway right it's not a lot so but
 

4299
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:38,030
host anyway right it's not a lot so but
I would be like but I wouldn't say

4300

but suddenly I find this
 

4305
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:44,390
but suddenly I find this
moving I find it more I honestly I'm not

4306
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:44,400
moving I find it more I honestly I'm not
 

4307
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,550
moving I find it more I honestly I'm not
being facetious I find it moving and I

4308
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:46,560
being facetious I find it moving and I
 

4309
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,770
being facetious I find it moving and I
almost feel like I can see it through

4310
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:48,780
almost feel like I can see it through
 

4311
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:50,450
almost feel like I can see it through
your eyes because the way you describe

4312
01:26:50,450 --> 01:26:50,460
your eyes because the way you describe
 

4313
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:52,250
your eyes because the way you describe
so vividly and you're passionate about

01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:52,260
so vividly and you're passionate about
 

4315
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:54,110
so vividly and you're passionate about
it and this is what's real so ultimately

4316
01:26:54,110 --> 01:26:54,120
it and this is what's real so ultimately
 

4317
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:57,229
it and this is what's real so ultimately
love is not

4318
01:26:57,229 --> 01:26:57,239
love is not
 

4319
01:26:57,239 --> 01:26:59,750
love is not
is neither in large language models nor

4320
01:26:59,750 --> 01:26:59,760
is neither in large language models nor
 

4321
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:01,850
is neither in large language models nor
in something mystical it's exactly in

4322
01:27:01,850 --> 01:27:01,860
in something mystical it's exactly in
 

4323
01:27:01,860 --> 01:27:05,209
in something mystical it's exactly in
this moments of passion and I would I

4324
01:27:05,209 --> 01:27:05,219
this moments of passion and I would I
 

4325
01:27:05,219 --> 01:27:06,530
this moments of passion and I would I
would

4326
01:27:06,530 --> 01:27:06,540
would
 

4327
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:08,629
would
I would even go as far as saying that in

4328
01:27:08,629 --> 01:27:08,639
I would even go as far as saying that in
 

4329
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:12,129
I would even go as far as saying that in
this moment when you're describing it it

4330
01:27:12,129 --> 01:27:12,139
this moment when you're describing it it
 

4331
01:27:12,139 --> 01:27:14,629
this moment when you're describing it it
there was a connection of sorts so that

4332
01:27:14,629 --> 01:27:14,639
there was a connection of sorts so that
 

4333
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:17,629
there was a connection of sorts so that
I could feel your passion for it and in

4334
01:27:17,629 --> 01:27:17,639
I could feel your passion for it and in
 

4335
01:27:17,639 --> 01:27:19,490
I could feel your passion for it and in
this moment something else comes up

4336
01:27:19,490 --> 01:27:19,500
this moment something else comes up
 

4337
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:22,129
this moment something else comes up
Which is far beyond any

4338
01:27:22,129 --> 01:27:22,139
Which is far beyond any
 

4339
01:27:22,139 --> 01:27:24,229
Which is far beyond any
any theories that we can come up with

4340
01:27:24,229 --> 01:27:24,239
any theories that we can come up with
 

4341
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:27,110
any theories that we can come up with
and that's what we for now exactly so on

4342
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:27,120
and that's what we for now exactly so on
 

4343
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:30,110
and that's what we for now exactly so on
one side there is this impulse of

4344
01:27:30,110 --> 01:27:30,120
one side there is this impulse of
 

4345
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:32,750
one side there is this impulse of
finding this Theory a theory and then

4346
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:32,760
finding this Theory a theory and then
 

4347
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:34,550
finding this Theory a theory and then
there is another impulse to escape from

4348
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:34,560
there is another impulse to escape from
 

4349
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:37,850
there is another impulse to escape from
what has already been known so one in

4350
01:27:37,850 --> 01:27:37,860
what has already been known so one in
 

4351
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:40,189
what has already been known so one in
other words like in my basic example is

4352
01:27:40,189 --> 01:27:40,199
other words like in my basic example is
 

4353
01:27:40,199 --> 01:27:41,750
other words like in my basic example is
one impulse to say everything is a real

4354
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:41,760
one impulse to say everything is a real
 

4355
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:42,890
one impulse to say everything is a real
number square root of negative one

4356
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:42,900
number square root of negative one
 

4357
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:45,229
number square root of negative one
doesn't exist but another impulse is I'm

4358
01:27:45,229 --> 01:27:45,239
doesn't exist but another impulse is I'm
 

4359
01:27:45,239 --> 01:27:47,930
doesn't exist but another impulse is I'm
going to be this naughty child who is

4360
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:47,940
going to be this naughty child who is
 

4361
01:27:47,940 --> 01:27:49,610
going to be this naughty child who is
not afraid to be an idiot and I will say

4362
01:27:49,610 --> 01:27:49,620
not afraid to be an idiot and I will say
 

4363
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:51,950
not afraid to be an idiot and I will say
square root of negative 15 is real

4364
01:27:51,950 --> 01:27:51,960
square root of negative 15 is real
 

4365
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:54,169
square root of negative 15 is real
and both are essential

4366
01:27:54,169 --> 01:27:54,179
and both are essential
 

4367
01:27:54,179 --> 01:27:56,270
and both are essential
when it's done with conviction when it's

4368
01:27:56,270 --> 01:27:56,280
when it's done with conviction when it's
 

4369
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:59,390
when it's done with conviction when it's
done with passion when it's not like you

4370
01:27:59,390 --> 01:27:59,400
done with passion when it's not like you
 

4371
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:01,550
done with passion when it's not like you
know you know

4372
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:01,560
know you know
 

4373
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:05,270
know you know
um gratuitous or when it's not it

4374
01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:05,280
um gratuitous or when it's not it
 

4375
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,970
um gratuitous or when it's not it
doesn't come from self-limit

4376
01:28:06,970 --> 01:28:06,980
doesn't come from self-limit
 

4377
01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:10,310
doesn't come from self-limit
self-limiting but comes from this sense

4378
01:28:10,310 --> 01:28:10,320
self-limiting but comes from this sense
 

4379
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:13,669
self-limiting but comes from this sense
of this is how I am this is how I feel

4380
01:28:13,669 --> 01:28:13,679
of this is how I am this is how I feel
 

4381
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:17,149
of this is how I am this is how I feel
it is real that's where the progress is

4382
01:28:17,149 --> 01:28:17,159
it is real that's where the progress is
 

4383
01:28:17,159 --> 01:28:18,890
it is real that's where the progress is
that's where creativity is and that's

4384
01:28:18,890 --> 01:28:18,900
that's where creativity is and that's
 

4385
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:20,810
that's where creativity is and that's
where I would even say a real connection

4386
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:20,820
where I would even say a real connection
 

4387
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:24,649
where I would even say a real connection
is because the strive to me that we I

4388
01:28:24,649 --> 01:28:24,659
is because the strive to me that we I
 

4389
01:28:24,659 --> 01:28:26,990
is because the strive to me that we I
observed today in our society and the

4390
01:28:26,990 --> 01:28:27,000
observed today in our society and the
 

4391
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,970
observed today in our society and the
society level at the level of humans and

4392
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:28,980
society level at the level of humans and
 

4393
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:31,610
society level at the level of humans and
so on it comes from not seeing the other

4394
01:28:31,610 --> 01:28:31,620
so on it comes from not seeing the other
 

4395
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:34,070
so on it comes from not seeing the other
person actually and being caught up in a

4396
01:28:34,070 --> 01:28:34,080
person actually and being caught up in a
 

4397
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:37,370
person actually and being caught up in a
very specific conceptual bubble you see

4398
01:28:37,370 --> 01:28:37,380
very specific conceptual bubble you see
 

4399
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:40,250
very specific conceptual bubble you see
and the way out of it is not to refine

4400
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:40,260
and the way out of it is not to refine
 

4401
01:28:40,260 --> 01:28:43,490
and the way out of it is not to refine
the bubble but just break out of it a

4402
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:43,500
the bubble but just break out of it a
 

4403
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:46,430
the bubble but just break out of it a
good guide out of the bubble is a

4404
01:28:46,430 --> 01:28:46,440
good guide out of the bubble is a
 

4405
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:48,530
good guide out of the bubble is a
childlike passion whatever discovering

4406
01:28:48,530 --> 01:28:48,540
childlike passion whatever discovering
 

4407
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:50,629
childlike passion whatever discovering
that and following it Goosebumps yeah

4408
01:28:50,629 --> 01:28:50,639
that and following it Goosebumps yeah
 

4409
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:53,570
that and following it Goosebumps yeah
following the Goosebumps yeah to to the

4410
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:53,580
following the Goosebumps yeah to to the

01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:57,649
following the Goosebumps yeah to to the
to you know not the rigor of science but

01:28:57,649 --> 01:28:57,659
to you know not the rigor of science but
 

4413
01:28:57,659 --> 01:29:00,890
to you know not the rigor of science but
uh the magic of Goosebumps and then if

4414
01:29:00,890 --> 01:29:00,900
uh the magic of Goosebumps and then if
 

4415
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:02,689
uh the magic of Goosebumps and then if
you're interested try to find a

4416
01:29:02,689 --> 01:29:02,699
you're interested try to find a
 

4417
01:29:02,699 --> 01:29:05,149
you're interested try to find a
confirmation of those goosebumps in

4418
01:29:05,149 --> 01:29:05,159
confirmation of those goosebumps in
 

4419
01:29:05,159 --> 01:29:09,229
confirmation of those goosebumps in
science or whatever you know you know uh

4420
01:29:09,229 --> 01:29:09,239
science or whatever you know you know uh
 

4421
01:29:09,239 --> 01:29:10,970
science or whatever you know you know uh
you find interesting and most of the

4422
01:29:10,970 --> 01:29:10,980
you find interesting and most of the
 

4423
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:12,770
you find interesting and most of the
time you'll fail and most time you fail

4424
01:29:12,770 --> 01:29:12,780
time you'll fail and most time you fail

you mentioned gato's the completeness

4434
01:29:24,530 --> 01:29:24,540
you mentioned gato's the completeness
 

4435
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:26,570
you mentioned gato's the completeness
theorem uh can you can you talk a little

4436
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:26,580
theorem uh can you can you talk a little
 

4437
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:29,209
theorem uh can you can you talk a little
bit about it what is it as you

01:29:29,209 --> 01:29:29,219
bit about it what is it as you
 

4439
01:29:29,219 --> 01:29:31,010
bit about it what is it as you
understand it did it break mathematics

understand it did it break mathematics

understand it did it break mathematics
maybe another question is what are the

4442
01:29:33,649 --> 01:29:33,659
maybe another question is what are the
 

4443
01:29:33,659 --> 01:29:36,110
maybe another question is what are the
limits of mathematics what is

4444
01:29:36,110 --> 01:29:36,120
limits of mathematics what is
 

4445
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:38,030
limits of mathematics what is
mathematics from the perspective of

getting us to completeness theorem oh

4449
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:41,149

01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:11,390
Einstein and other great scientists for
Neumann Hermann Weil and so on but you

4472
01:30:11,390 --> 01:30:11,400
Neumann Hermann Weil and so on but you
 

4473
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:14,090
Neumann Hermann Weil and so on but you
know one one interesting um

4474
01:30:14,090 --> 01:30:14,100
know one one interesting um
 

4475
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:16,970
know one one interesting um
uh quote that I like in disregard is

4476
01:30:16,970 --> 01:30:16,980
uh quote that I like in disregard is
 

4477
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:19,669
uh quote that I like in disregard is
that Einstein said that at some point he

4478
01:30:19,669 --> 01:30:19,679
that Einstein said that at some point he
 

4479
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:22,790
that Einstein said that at some point he
said that the only reason he came to the

4480
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:22,800
said that the only reason he came to the
 

4481
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,250
said that the only reason he came to the
Institute was that he would have the

4482
01:30:25,250 --> 01:30:25,260
Institute was that he would have the
 

4483
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:27,770
Institute was that he would have the
privilege of walking back home with godo

4484
01:30:27,770 --> 01:30:27,780
privilege of walking back home with godo
 

4485
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:29,629
privilege of walking back home with godo
in the evening so in other words

4486
01:30:29,629 --> 01:30:29,639
in the evening so in other words
 

4487
01:30:29,639 --> 01:30:31,550
in the evening so in other words
Einstein thought that the girl was the

4488
01:30:31,550 --> 01:30:31,560
Einstein thought that the girl was the
 

4489
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:34,189
Einstein thought that the girl was the
smart one okay so

4490
01:30:34,189 --> 01:30:34,199
smart one okay so
 

4491
01:30:34,199 --> 01:30:36,590
smart one okay so
um so he um his most important

4492
01:30:36,590 --> 01:30:36,600
um so he um his most important
 

4493
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:38,030
um so he um his most important
contribution

4494
01:30:38,030 --> 01:30:38,040
contribution
 

4495
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:39,910
contribution
was his two

4496
01:30:39,910 --> 01:30:39,920
was his two
 

4497
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:42,470
was his two
incompleteness ethereums the first

4498
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:42,480
incompleteness ethereums the first
 

4499
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:43,729
incompleteness ethereums the first
incompleteness theorem and the second

4500
01:30:43,729 --> 01:30:43,739
incompleteness theorem and the second
 

4501
01:30:43,739 --> 01:30:45,290
incompleteness theorem and the second
incompleteness theorem

4502
01:30:45,290 --> 01:30:45,300
incompleteness theorem
 

4503
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:46,610
incompleteness theorem
and

4504
01:30:46,610 --> 01:30:46,620
and
 

4505
01:30:46,620 --> 01:30:47,149
and
um

4506
01:30:47,149 --> 01:30:47,159
um
 

4507
01:30:47,159 --> 01:30:49,790
um
what is this about it's really about

4508
01:30:49,790 --> 01:30:49,800
what is this about it's really about
 

4509
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:52,570
what is this about it's really about
limitation inherent limitations of

4510
01:30:52,570 --> 01:30:52,580
limitation inherent limitations of
 

4511
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:54,830
limitation inherent limitations of
mathematical reasoning

4512
01:30:54,830 --> 01:30:54,840
mathematical reasoning
 

4513
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:57,770
mathematical reasoning
but my way of producing mathematical

4514
01:30:57,770 --> 01:30:57,780
but my way of producing mathematical
 

4515
01:30:57,780 --> 01:30:59,689
but my way of producing mathematical
theorems the way we do it

4516
01:30:59,689 --> 01:30:59,699
theorems the way we do it
 

4517
01:30:59,699 --> 01:31:02,990
theorems the way we do it
so to set the stage

4518
01:31:02,990 --> 01:31:03,000
so to set the stage
 

4519
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,689
so to set the stage
how do we actually do mathematics what

4520
01:31:05,689 --> 01:31:05,699
how do we actually do mathematics what
 

4521
01:31:05,699 --> 01:31:08,090
how do we actually do mathematics what
is so you know we know that we discussed

4522
01:31:08,090 --> 01:31:08,100
is so you know we know that we discussed
 

4523
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:09,530
is so you know we know that we discussed
that

4524
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:09,540
that
 

4525
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:11,510
that
say physics is based on mathematics and

4526
01:31:11,510 --> 01:31:11,520
say physics is based on mathematics and
 

4527
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:12,590
say physics is based on mathematics and
you could say chemistry is based on

4528
01:31:12,590 --> 01:31:12,600
you could say chemistry is based on
 

4529
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:14,149
you could say chemistry is based on
physics biology based on chemistry okay

4530
01:31:14,149 --> 01:31:14,159
physics biology based on chemistry okay
 

4531
01:31:14,159 --> 01:31:15,290
physics biology based on chemistry okay
so it comes to mathematics what is

4532
01:31:15,290 --> 01:31:15,300
so it comes to mathematics what is
 

4533
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:17,510
so it comes to mathematics what is
mathematics based on

4534
01:31:17,510 --> 01:31:17,520
mathematics based on
 

4535
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:21,169
mathematics based on
well mathematics is based on axioms

4536
01:31:21,169 --> 01:31:21,179
well mathematics is based on axioms
 

4537
01:31:21,179 --> 01:31:23,470
well mathematics is based on axioms
so any

4538
01:31:23,470 --> 01:31:23,480
so any
 

4539
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:26,810
so any
field of mathematics is

4540
01:31:26,810 --> 01:31:26,820
field of mathematics is
 

4541
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:29,750
field of mathematics is
can be can be presented as what is

4542
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:29,760
can be can be presented as what is
 

4543
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,550
can be can be presented as what is
called the formal system

4544
01:31:31,550 --> 01:31:31,560
called the formal system
 

4545
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:34,430
called the formal system
and at the core of the formal system is

4546
01:31:34,430 --> 01:31:34,440
and at the core of the formal system is
 

4547
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:37,729
and at the core of the formal system is
a system of axioms or postulates these

4548
01:31:37,729 --> 01:31:37,739
a system of axioms or postulates these
 

4549
01:31:37,739 --> 01:31:39,229
a system of axioms or postulates these
are the statements

4550
01:31:39,229 --> 01:31:39,239
are the statements
 

4551
01:31:39,239 --> 01:31:41,810
are the statements
which are taken for granted

4552
01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:41,820
which are taken for granted
 

4553
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:44,990
which are taken for granted
given without proof without proof an

4554
01:31:44,990 --> 01:31:45,000
given without proof without proof an
 

4555
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,790
given without proof without proof an
example would be so that one of the very

4556
01:31:46,790 --> 01:31:46,800
example would be so that one of the very
 

4557
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,950
example would be so that one of the very
first formal systems was the system was

4558
01:31:48,950 --> 01:31:48,960
first formal systems was the system was
 

4559
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:51,169
first formal systems was the system was
euclidean geometry developed by Euclid

4560
01:31:51,169 --> 01:31:51,179
euclidean geometry developed by Euclid
 

4561
01:31:51,179 --> 01:31:54,050
euclidean geometry developed by Euclid
in his famous book elements about 2200

4562
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:54,060
in his famous book elements about 2200
 

4563
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:55,430
in his famous book elements about 2200
years ago

4564
01:31:55,430 --> 01:31:55,440
years ago
 

4565
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:58,070
years ago
and it's about it's well it's a subject

4566
01:31:58,070 --> 01:31:58,080
and it's about it's well it's a subject
 

4567
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,990
and it's about it's well it's a subject
familiar from from school because we

4568
01:31:59,990 --> 01:32:00,000
familiar from from school because we
 

4569
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,010
familiar from from school because we
studied

4570
01:32:01,010 --> 01:32:01,020
studied
 

4571
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:03,410
studied
but what it's really about is about the

4572
01:32:03,410 --> 01:32:03,420
but what it's really about is about the
 

4573
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:06,169
but what it's really about is about the
geometry of the plane and the plane by

4574
01:32:06,169 --> 01:32:06,179
geometry of the plane and the plane by
 

4575
01:32:06,179 --> 01:32:07,970
geometry of the plane and the plane by
plane I mean just the stable top

4576
01:32:07,970 --> 01:32:07,980
plane I mean just the stable top
 

4577
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:09,470
plane I mean just the stable top
extended to Infinity in all directions

4578
01:32:09,470 --> 01:32:09,480
extended to Infinity in all directions
 

4579
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:11,590
extended to Infinity in all directions
kind of a perfect plane a perfect

4580
01:32:11,590 --> 01:32:11,600
kind of a perfect plane a perfect
 

4581
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:14,990
kind of a perfect plane a perfect
perfectly even table

4582
01:32:14,990 --> 01:32:15,000
perfectly even table
 

4583
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:19,010
perfectly even table
and um so euclidean geometry is about

4584
01:32:19,010 --> 01:32:19,020
and um so euclidean geometry is about
 

4585
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:21,350
and um so euclidean geometry is about
very geometric figures on the plane

4586
01:32:21,350 --> 01:32:21,360
very geometric figures on the plane
 

4587
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:24,890
very geometric figures on the plane
specifically lines triangles circles

4588
01:32:24,890 --> 01:32:24,900
specifically lines triangles circles
 

4589
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:26,810
specifically lines triangles circles
things like that

4590
01:32:26,810 --> 01:32:26,820
things like that
 

4591
01:32:26,820 --> 01:32:28,790
things like that
so what's an example of an Axion an

4592
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:28,800
so what's an example of an Axion an
 

4593
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,229
so what's an example of an Axion an
example of an axiom is that if you have

4594
01:32:30,229 --> 01:32:30,239
example of an axiom is that if you have
 

4595
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:31,610
example of an axiom is that if you have
two points

4596
01:32:31,610 --> 01:32:31,620
two points
 

4597
01:32:31,620 --> 01:32:34,250
two points
which are not which are distinct two

4598
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:34,260
which are not which are distinct two
 

4599
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:36,050
which are not which are distinct two
points on the plane then there is a

4600
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:36,060
points on the plane then there is a
 

4601
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:38,810
points on the plane then there is a
unique line which passes through them

4602
01:32:38,810 --> 01:32:38,820
unique line which passes through them
 

4603
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:40,970
unique line which passes through them
now kind of sounds reasonable

4604
01:32:40,970 --> 01:32:40,980
now kind of sounds reasonable
 

4605
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:44,330
now kind of sounds reasonable
but this is an example of an Axion

4606
01:32:44,330 --> 01:32:44,340
but this is an example of an Axion
 

4607
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:46,970
but this is an example of an Axion
in mathematics you can you have to have

4608
01:32:46,970 --> 01:32:46,980
in mathematics you can you have to have
 

4609
01:32:46,980 --> 01:32:48,830
in mathematics you can you have to have
a seed so to speak you have to start

4610
01:32:48,830 --> 01:32:48,840
a seed so to speak you have to start
 

4611
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:49,910
a seed so to speak you have to start
with something

4612
01:32:49,910 --> 01:32:49,920
with something
 

4613
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:52,490
with something
and you have to choose certain

4614
01:32:52,490 --> 01:32:52,500
and you have to choose certain
 

4615
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:55,370
and you have to choose certain
postulates or statements which you

4616
01:32:55,370 --> 01:32:55,380
postulates or statements which you
 

4617
01:32:55,380 --> 01:32:56,870
postulates or statements which you
simply take for granted which do not

4618
01:32:56,870 --> 01:32:56,880
simply take for granted which do not
 

4619
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:59,510
simply take for granted which do not
require proof usually they are ones

4620
01:32:59,510 --> 01:32:59,520
require proof usually they are ones
 

4621
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,729
require proof usually they are ones
which kind of intuitively clear to you

4622
01:33:01,729 --> 01:33:01,739
which kind of intuitively clear to you
 

4623
01:33:01,739 --> 01:33:04,729
which kind of intuitively clear to you
but in any case you cannot have you

4624
01:33:04,729 --> 01:33:04,739
but in any case you cannot have you
 

4625
01:33:04,739 --> 01:33:07,129
but in any case you cannot have you
could not have any mathematics without

4626
01:33:07,129 --> 01:33:07,139
could not have any mathematics without
 

4627
01:33:07,139 --> 01:33:09,110
could not have any mathematics without
choosing those actions and you refer to

4628
01:33:09,110 --> 01:33:09,120
choosing those actions and you refer to
 

4629
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:11,209
choosing those actions and you refer to
those as the Observer because they're

4630
01:33:11,209 --> 01:33:11,219
those as the Observer because they're
 

4631
01:33:11,219 --> 01:33:14,750
those as the Observer because they're
kind of subjective The Observer comes in

4632
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:14,760
kind of subjective The Observer comes in
 

4633
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:17,689
kind of subjective The Observer comes in
the process of choosing the axioms

4634
01:33:17,689 --> 01:33:17,699
the process of choosing the axioms
 

4635
01:33:17,699 --> 01:33:21,669
the process of choosing the axioms
who chooses the axons the turtles

4636
01:33:21,669 --> 01:33:21,679

 

4637
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:24,350

you know like to say who is watching The

4638
01:33:24,350 --> 01:33:24,360
you know like to say who is watching The
 

4639
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:27,890
you know like to say who is watching The
Watcher yeah and so in mathematics but

4640
01:33:27,890 --> 01:33:27,900
Watcher yeah and so in mathematics but
 

4641
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:30,290
Watcher yeah and so in mathematics but
you see mathematicians are so clever

4642
01:33:30,290 --> 01:33:30,300
you see mathematicians are so clever
 

4643
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:32,209
you see mathematicians are so clever
it's really kind of like a little kind

4644
01:33:32,209 --> 01:33:32,219
it's really kind of like a little kind
 

4645
01:33:32,219 --> 01:33:35,209
it's really kind of like a little kind
of a game of mirrors that we often like

4646
01:33:35,209 --> 01:33:35,219
of a game of mirrors that we often like
 

4647
01:33:35,219 --> 01:33:38,330
of a game of mirrors that we often like
to say and I used to say that

4648
01:33:38,330 --> 01:33:38,340
to say and I used to say that
 

4649
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:40,250
to say and I used to say that
um that mathematics is objective it's

4650
01:33:40,250 --> 01:33:40,260
um that mathematics is objective it's
 

4651
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:43,610
um that mathematics is objective it's
really one the only objective science

4652
01:33:43,610 --> 01:33:43,620
really one the only objective science
 

4653
01:33:43,620 --> 01:33:47,410
really one the only objective science
but that's because we hide this this

4654
01:33:47,410 --> 01:33:47,420
but that's because we hide this this
 

4655
01:33:47,420 --> 01:33:51,709
but that's because we hide this this
fact is based on axioms and the fact

4656
01:33:51,709 --> 01:33:51,719
fact is based on axioms and the fact
 

4657
01:33:51,719 --> 01:33:53,149
fact is based on axioms and the fact
that

4658
01:33:53,149 --> 01:33:53,159
that
 

4659
01:33:53,159 --> 01:33:56,090
that
that there is no there is no unique

4660
01:33:56,090 --> 01:33:56,100
that there is no there is no unique
 

4661

that there is no there is no unique
choice

4662
01:33:57,169 --> 01:33:57,179
choice
 

4663
01:33:57,179 --> 01:33:59,209
choice
there are many choices

4664
01:33:59,209 --> 01:33:59,219
there are many choices
 

4665
01:33:59,219 --> 01:34:01,189
there are many choices
and so euclidean geometry is actually a

4666
01:34:01,189 --> 01:34:01,199
and so euclidean geometry is actually a
 

4667
01:34:01,199 --> 01:34:04,790
and so euclidean geometry is actually a
good illustration of this because

4668
01:34:04,790 --> 01:34:04,800
good illustration of this because
 

4669
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,550
good illustration of this because
Euclid had five axioms four of them were

Euclid had five axioms four of them were
 

4671
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:09,169
Euclid had five axioms four of them were
kind of obvious like the one I just

4672
01:34:09,169 --> 01:34:09,179
kind of obvious like the one I just
 

4673
01:34:09,179 --> 01:34:11,330
kind of obvious like the one I just
mentioned and the fifth

4674
01:34:11,330 --> 01:34:11,340
mentioned and the fifth
 

4675
01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:13,550
mentioned and the fifth
which came to be known famously as the

4676
01:34:13,550 --> 01:34:13,560
which came to be known famously as the
 

4677

which came to be known famously as the
fifth postulate

fifth postulate
 

4679
01:34:14,820 --> 01:34:16,850
fifth postulate
was that if you have a line

4680
01:34:16,850 --> 01:34:16,860
was that if you have a line
 

4681
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,590
was that if you have a line
and you have a point outside of this

line
 

4685
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:21,169
line
there is a unique line passing through

4686
01:34:21,169 --> 01:34:21,179
there is a unique line passing through
 

4687
01:34:21,179 --> 01:34:23,750
there is a unique line passing through
that point which is parallel to the

that point which is parallel to the

and Euclid himself was uncomfortable

4694
01:34:28,970 --> 01:34:28,980
and Euclid himself was uncomfortable
 

4695
01:34:28,980 --> 01:34:31,189
and Euclid himself was uncomfortable
about this because he felt that it was

about this because he felt that it was

from the axioms every statement you
obtain you call ethereum

4796
01:36:28,790 --> 01:36:28,800
obtain you call ethereum
 

4797
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:30,350
obtain you call ethereum
and you kind of add it to the collection

4798
01:36:30,350 --> 01:36:30,360
and you kind of add it to the collection
 

4799
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:32,330
and you kind of add it to the collection
of true statements

4800
01:36:32,330 --> 01:36:32,340
of true statements
 

4801
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:35,330
of true statements
and then the question is how far can you

4802
01:36:35,330 --> 01:36:35,340
and then the question is how far can you
 

4803
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:37,070
and then the question is how far can you
go how many statements can you prove

4804
01:36:37,070 --> 01:36:37,080
go how many statements can you prove
 

4805
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:38,270
go how many statements can you prove
this way

4806
01:36:38,270 --> 01:36:38,280
this way
 

4807
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:41,570
this way
of course you want it to be the system

4808
01:36:41,570 --> 01:36:41,580
of course you want it to be the system
 

4809
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:43,970
of course you want it to be the system
to be non-trivial in the sense that you

4810
01:36:43,970 --> 01:36:43,980
to be non-trivial in the sense that you
 

4811
01:36:43,980 --> 01:36:45,649
to be non-trivial in the sense that you
don't prove everything

4812
01:36:45,649 --> 01:36:45,659
don't prove everything
 

4813
01:36:45,659 --> 01:36:47,270
don't prove everything
because if you prove everything it would

4814
01:36:47,270 --> 01:36:47,280
because if you prove everything it would
 

4815
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:49,010
because if you prove everything it would
mean that it's self-contradictory that

4816
01:36:49,010 --> 01:36:49,020
mean that it's self-contradictory that
 

4817
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:50,930
mean that it's self-contradictory that
you'd prove a statement a and it's

4818
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:50,940
you'd prove a statement a and it's
 

4819
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:54,050
you'd prove a statement a and it's
negation so that's kind of useless

4820
01:36:54,050 --> 01:36:54,060
negation so that's kind of useless
 

4821
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:56,810
negation so that's kind of useless
it has to be discriminating enough

4822
01:36:56,810 --> 01:36:56,820
it has to be discriminating enough
 

4823
01:36:56,820 --> 01:36:59,090
it has to be discriminating enough
so that it doesn't doesn't prove

4824
01:36:59,090 --> 01:36:59,100
so that it doesn't doesn't prove
 

4825
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:01,669
so that it doesn't doesn't prove
contradictory statements so that there

4826
01:37:01,669 --> 01:37:01,679
contradictory statements so that there
 

4827
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:02,990
contradictory statements so that there
is already a question of that

4828
01:37:02,990 --> 01:37:03,000
is already a question of that
 

4829
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,790
is already a question of that
mathematical consistency it has to be

4830
01:37:04,790 --> 01:37:04,800
mathematical consistency it has to be
 

4831
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:06,709
mathematical consistency it has to be
consistent in the sense that

4832
01:37:06,709 --> 01:37:06,719
consistent in the sense that
 

4833
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:09,709
consistent in the sense that
it is not self-contradictory

4834
01:37:09,709 --> 01:37:09,719
it is not self-contradictory
 

4835
01:37:09,719 --> 01:37:13,149
it is not self-contradictory
and then the idea that was basically

4836
01:37:13,149 --> 01:37:13,159
and then the idea that was basically
 

4837
01:37:13,159 --> 01:37:15,770
and then the idea that was basically
prevalent in the world of mathematics by

4838
01:37:15,770 --> 01:37:15,780
prevalent in the world of mathematics by
 

4839
01:37:15,780 --> 01:37:17,990
prevalent in the world of mathematics by
the beginning of the 20th century was

4840
01:37:17,990 --> 01:37:18,000
the beginning of the 20th century was
 

4841
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,310
the beginning of the 20th century was
that in principle all of mathematics

4842
01:37:19,310 --> 01:37:19,320
that in principle all of mathematics
 

4843
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:20,990
that in principle all of mathematics
could be derived this way we just have

4844
01:37:20,990 --> 01:37:21,000
could be derived this way we just have
 

4845
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,510
could be derived this way we just have
to find the correct system of axioms

4846
01:37:23,510 --> 01:37:23,520
to find the correct system of axioms
 

4847
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:25,729
to find the correct system of axioms
and then everything you ever need

4848
01:37:25,729 --> 01:37:25,739
and then everything you ever need
 

4849
01:37:25,739 --> 01:37:27,470
and then everything you ever need
would be

4850
01:37:27,470 --> 01:37:27,480
would be
 

4851
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:28,010
would be
um

4852
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:28,020
um
 

4853
01:37:28,020 --> 01:37:31,129
um
could be produced by this

4854
01:37:31,129 --> 01:37:31,139
could be produced by this
 

4855
01:37:31,139 --> 01:37:33,169
could be produced by this
procedure which is really algorithmic

4856
01:37:33,169 --> 01:37:33,179
procedure which is really algorithmic

now think about it what is special about

4862
01:37:41,270 --> 01:37:41,280
now think about it what is special about
 

4863
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:42,709
now think about it what is special about
this process

in this process you are just

in this process you are just
 

4867
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:46,010
in this process you are just

manipulating
 

4869
01:37:46,020 --> 01:37:48,410
manipulating
symbols basically you're going from one

4870
01:37:48,410 --> 01:37:48,420
symbols basically you're going from one
 

4871
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:50,590
symbols basically you're going from one
statement to another without really

statement to another without really
 

4873
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:53,209
statement to another without really
understanding the meaning of it so it's

01:37:53,209 --> 01:37:53,219
understanding the meaning of it so it's
 

4875
01:37:53,219 --> 01:37:55,129

most mathematician mathematicians

4888
01:38:06,950 --> 01:38:06,960
most mathematician mathematicians
 

4889
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:08,629
most mathematician mathematicians
believed that this way you can produce

4890
01:38:08,629 --> 01:38:08,639
believed that this way you can produce
 

4891
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:10,910
believed that this way you can produce
all true statements and if this were

4892
01:38:10,910 --> 01:38:10,920
all true statements and if this were
 

4893
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:13,129
all true statements and if this were
true it would give a lot of credibility

4894
01:38:13,129 --> 01:38:13,139
true it would give a lot of credibility
 

4895
01:38:13,139 --> 01:38:15,709
true it would give a lot of credibility
to the thesis that everything in life is

4896
01:38:15,709 --> 01:38:15,719
to the thesis that everything in life is
 

4897
01:38:15,719 --> 01:38:16,750
to the thesis that everything in life is
computational

4898
01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:16,760
computational
 

4899
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:20,030
computational
or life is computation because then at

4900
01:38:20,030 --> 01:38:20,040
or life is computation because then at
 

4901
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:21,110
or life is computation because then at
least mathematics is computational

4902
01:38:21,110 --> 01:38:21,120
least mathematics is computational
 

4903
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:23,090
least mathematics is computational
because then it can be programmed

4904
01:38:23,090 --> 01:38:23,100
because then it can be programmed
 

4905
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:26,629
because then it can be programmed
and the computer after sufficient time

4906
01:38:26,629 --> 01:38:26,639
and the computer after sufficient time
 

4907
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:29,930
and the computer after sufficient time
depending on on its capacity would

4908
01:38:29,930 --> 01:38:29,940
depending on on its capacity would
 

4909
01:38:29,940 --> 01:38:31,729
depending on on its capacity would
produce every true statement

4910
01:38:31,729 --> 01:38:31,739
produce every true statement
 

4911
01:38:31,739 --> 01:38:33,649
produce every true statement
so guildo's first incompetence theorem

4912
01:38:33,649 --> 01:38:33,659
so guildo's first incompetence theorem
 

4913
01:38:33,659 --> 01:38:35,090
so guildo's first incompetence theorem
says that that's not the case

4914
01:38:35,090 --> 01:38:35,100
says that that's not the case
 

4915
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:36,830
says that that's not the case
and it's not just says it but it proves

4916
01:38:36,830 --> 01:38:36,840
and it's not just says it but it proves
 

4917
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:39,229
and it's not just says it but it proves
it at you know the highest level of

4918
01:38:39,229 --> 01:38:39,239
it at you know the highest level of
 

4919
01:38:39,239 --> 01:38:41,209
it at you know the highest level of
rigor that is available in math Max that

4920
01:38:41,209 --> 01:38:41,219
rigor that is available in math Max that
 

4921
01:38:41,219 --> 01:38:42,649
rigor that is available in math Max that
is to say within another formal system

4922
01:38:42,649 --> 01:38:42,659
is to say within another formal system
 

4923
01:38:42,659 --> 01:38:45,410
is to say within another formal system
that he was operating in

4924
01:38:45,410 --> 01:38:45,420
that he was operating in
 

4925
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:47,629
that he was operating in
so more precisely

4926
01:38:47,629 --> 01:38:47,639
so more precisely
 

4927
01:38:47,639 --> 01:38:49,910
so more precisely
what he proved was that if you have a

4928
01:38:49,910 --> 01:38:49,920
what he proved was that if you have a
 

4929
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:51,590
what he proved was that if you have a
sufficiently sophisticated formal system

01:38:51,590 --> 01:38:51,600
sufficiently sophisticated formal system
 

4931
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:54,410

then what what is left to do if you're a

01:40:40,550 --> 01:40:40,560
then what what is left to do if you're a
 

5023
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:41,750
then what what is left to do if you're a
mathematician so that would be

5024
01:40:41,750 --> 01:40:41,760
mathematician so that would be
 

5025
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:43,490
mathematician so that would be
depressing to me

maybe some new technology some new ideas
will be brought into the subject

will be brought into the subject
 

5041
01:40:58,820 --> 01:41:01,910
will be brought into the subject
and the meaning of the word computation

5042

and the meaning of the word computation
 

5043
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:03,410
and the meaning of the word computation
like now we think of condition a

what if in the future another genius

5050
01:41:10,070 --> 01:41:10,080
what if in the future another genius
 

5051
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:12,410
what if in the future another genius
like on Turing will come and propose

5052
01:41:12,410 --> 01:41:12,420
like on Turing will come and propose

something else the theory will evolve
the way you know we went from Newton's

5056
01:41:16,850 --> 01:41:16,860
the way you know we went from Newton's
 

5057
01:41:16,860 --> 01:41:19,610
the way you know we went from Newton's
gravity to Einstein's gravity maybe in

5058
01:41:19,610 --> 01:41:19,620
gravity to Einstein's gravity maybe in
 

5059
01:41:19,620 --> 01:41:21,350
gravity to Einstein's gravity maybe in
the framework of that concept some other

5060

the framework of that concept some other
 

5061
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:23,169
the framework of that concept some other
things will become possible

5062
01:41:23,169 --> 01:41:23,179
things will become possible
 

5063
01:41:23,179 --> 01:41:25,729
things will become possible
you know so

5064
01:41:25,729 --> 01:41:25,739
you know so
 

5065
01:41:25,739 --> 01:41:29,149
you know so
um it's not

5066
01:41:29,149 --> 01:41:29,159

 

5067
01:41:29,159 --> 01:41:31,250

to me it's kind of like

5068
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:31,260
to me it's kind of like
 

5069
01:41:31,260 --> 01:41:33,910
to me it's kind of like
not so much about

5070
01:41:33,910 --> 01:41:33,920
not so much about
 

5071
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:36,830
not so much about
deciding once and for all how it is or

5072
01:41:36,830 --> 01:41:36,840
deciding once and for all how it is or
 

5073
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:39,050
deciding once and for all how it is or
how it should be but kind of like

5074
01:41:39,050 --> 01:41:39,060
how it should be but kind of like
 

5075
01:41:39,060 --> 01:41:42,530
how it should be but kind of like
accepting it as an open-ended process I

5076
01:41:42,530 --> 01:41:42,540
accepting it as an open-ended process I
 

5077
01:41:42,540 --> 01:41:44,030
accepting it as an open-ended process I
think that's much more valuable in some

5078
01:41:44,030 --> 01:41:44,040
think that's much more valuable in some
 

5079
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:47,209
think that's much more valuable in some
sense than deciding things one way or

5080
01:41:47,209 --> 01:41:47,219
sense than deciding things one way or
 

5081
01:41:47,219 --> 01:41:50,810
sense than deciding things one way or
another you know I wonder

5082
01:41:50,810 --> 01:41:50,820
another you know I wonder
 

5083
01:41:50,820 --> 01:41:53,209
another you know I wonder
I don't know if you think or know much

5084
01:41:53,209 --> 01:41:53,219
I don't know if you think or know much
 

5085
01:41:53,219 --> 01:41:56,750
I don't know if you think or know much
about cellular automata and uh the idea

5086
01:41:56,750 --> 01:41:56,760
about cellular automata and uh the idea
 

5087
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:57,950
about cellular automata and uh the idea
of emergence

5088
01:41:57,950 --> 01:41:57,960
of emergence
 

5089
01:41:57,960 --> 01:42:01,250
of emergence
I I often return to Game of Life yeah

5090
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:01,260
I I often return to Game of Life yeah
 

5091
01:42:01,260 --> 01:42:03,890
I I often return to Game of Life yeah
and just look at the thing amazing right

5092
01:42:03,890 --> 01:42:03,900
and just look at the thing amazing right
 

5093
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:05,930
and just look at the thing amazing right
and wonder what kind of things they can

5094
01:42:05,930 --> 01:42:05,940
and wonder what kind of things they can
 

5095
01:42:05,940 --> 01:42:07,910
and wonder what kind of things they can
do with such a small

5096
01:42:07,910 --> 01:42:07,920
do with such a small
 

5097
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:10,370
do with such a small
um you know tools yeah for simple rules

5098
01:42:10,370 --> 01:42:10,380
um you know tools yeah for simple rules
 

5099
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:13,550
um you know tools yeah for simple rules
a distributed system can create complex

Behavior
 

5103
01:42:14,820 --> 01:42:17,030
Behavior
and it makes you wonder that maybe the

5104
01:42:17,030 --> 01:42:17,040
and it makes you wonder that maybe the
 

5105
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:19,010
and it makes you wonder that maybe the
thing we'll call computation

5106
01:42:19,010 --> 01:42:19,020
thing we'll call computation
 

5107
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:22,550
thing we'll call computation
is simple at the base layer but when you

5108
01:42:22,550 --> 01:42:22,560
is simple at the base layer but when you
 

5109
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,950
is simple at the base layer but when you
start looking at greater and greater

5110
01:42:24,950 --> 01:42:24,960
start looking at greater and greater
 

5111
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:26,930
start looking at greater and greater
layers of abstraction you zoom out with

blurry vision maybe after a few drinks

5114
01:42:29,030 --> 01:42:29,040
blurry vision maybe after a few drinks
 

5115
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:31,729
blurry vision maybe after a few drinks
you start to see some uh something

5116
01:42:31,729 --> 01:42:31,739
you start to see some uh something
 

5117
01:42:31,739 --> 01:42:34,250
you start to see some uh something

it's a why question I suppose another
 

5141
01:42:57,420 --> 01:43:00,410
it's a why question I suppose another
but every why question will eventually

01:43:06,590 --> 01:43:06,600
we could have an approximate answer
 

5147
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:09,709
we could have an approximate answer
which still eludes something like

to describe it
 

5153
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:18,590

was 99 certainty or 99 accuracy yeah and

5154
01:43:18,590 --> 01:43:18,600
was 99 certainty or 99 accuracy yeah and
 

5155
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:22,310
was 99 certainty or 99 accuracy yeah and
then maybe you know

also you know one thing that I find
fascinating speaking of paradoxes and so

5170
01:43:37,010 --> 01:43:37,020
fascinating speaking of paradoxes and so
 

5171
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:37,910
fascinating speaking of paradoxes and so
on

5172
01:43:37,910 --> 01:43:37,920
on
 

5173
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:39,830
on
do you remember how everybody was

5174
01:43:39,830 --> 01:43:39,840
do you remember how everybody was
 

5175
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:41,750
do you remember how everybody was
freaking out about this blue dress

5176
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:41,760
freaking out about this blue dress
 

5177
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:44,149
freaking out about this blue dress
and the blue was it blue or was it black

5178
01:43:44,149 --> 01:43:44,159
and the blue was it blue or was it black
 

5179
01:43:44,159 --> 01:43:46,609
and the blue was it blue or was it black
yeah it was the yellow I think yellow or

5180
01:43:46,609 --> 01:43:46,619
yeah it was the yellow I think yellow or
 

5181
01:43:46,619 --> 01:43:49,669
yeah it was the yellow I think yellow or
and white or black and blue it almost

5182
01:43:49,669 --> 01:43:49,679
and white or black and blue it almost
 

5183
01:43:49,679 --> 01:43:51,350
and white or black and blue it almost
broke Twitter you know I remember that

5184
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:51,360
broke Twitter you know I remember that
 

5185
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:53,090
broke Twitter you know I remember that
yeah that night

5186
01:43:53,090 --> 01:43:53,100
yeah that night
 

5187
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:54,729
yeah that night
so there are many examples like that

5188
01:43:54,729 --> 01:43:54,739
so there are many examples like that
 

5189
01:43:54,739 --> 01:43:56,870
so there are many examples like that
where you can perceive things

5190

where you can perceive things
 

5191
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:59,390
where you can perceive things
differently and there is no way of

differently and there is no way of
 

5193
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:01,370
differently and there is no way of

and so on there are many others there
 

5219
01:44:26,820 --> 01:44:28,129
and so on there are many others there
are like the squares where you can

so
 

5227
01:44:33,119 --> 01:44:34,790
so
when we talk about

5228
01:44:34,790 --> 01:44:34,800
when we talk about
 

5229
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:36,590
when we talk about
neural networks

5230
01:44:36,590 --> 01:44:36,600
neural networks
 

5231
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:38,990
neural networks
they're talking about training

5232
01:44:38,990 --> 01:44:39,000
they're talking about training
 

5233
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,870
they're talking about training
data and stuff and so that you have some

5234
01:44:41,870 --> 01:44:41,880
data and stuff and so that you have some
 

5235
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:44,450
data and stuff and so that you have some
pictures for example that you feed to

5236
01:44:44,450 --> 01:44:44,460
pictures for example that you feed to
 

5237
01:44:44,460 --> 01:44:45,890
pictures for example that you feed to
your program

5238
01:44:45,890 --> 01:44:45,900
your program
 

5239
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:48,910
your program
and you try to find the most optimal

5240
01:44:48,910 --> 01:44:48,920
and you try to find the most optimal
 

5241
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:51,050
and you try to find the most optimal
neural network which would be able to

5242
01:44:51,050 --> 01:44:51,060
neural network which would be able to
 

5243
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:53,510

decide which one is it so the dog or cat

5244
01:44:53,510 --> 01:44:53,520
decide which one is it so the dog or cat
 

5245
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:55,910
decide which one is it so the dog or cat
or whatever but sometimes it doesn't

5246
01:44:55,910 --> 01:44:55,920
or whatever but sometimes it doesn't
 

5247
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:58,729
or whatever but sometimes it doesn't
have a definite answer

5248
01:44:58,729 --> 01:44:58,739
have a definite answer
 

5249
01:44:58,739 --> 01:45:01,850
have a definite answer
so what do you do then so do actually

5250
01:45:01,850 --> 01:45:01,860
so what do you do then so do actually
 

5251
01:45:01,860 --> 01:45:03,590
so what do you do then so do actually
it's a question I actually don't know

01:45:03,590 --> 01:45:03,600
it's a question I actually don't know
 

5253
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:07,430
it's a question I actually don't know
has modern AI even come to appreciate

5254
01:45:07,430 --> 01:45:07,440
has modern AI even come to appreciate
 

5255
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:10,010
has modern AI even come to appreciate
this question that actually sometimes

5256
01:45:10,010 --> 01:45:10,020
this question that actually sometimes
 

5257
01:45:10,020 --> 01:45:12,470
this question that actually sometimes
you can have a picture on which you

5258
01:45:12,470 --> 01:45:12,480
you can have a picture on which you
 

5259
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:15,050
you can have a picture on which you
cannot say what it is in it from one

5260
01:45:15,050 --> 01:45:15,060
cannot say what it is in it from one

episode is a duck how are you supposed

5264
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:19,260
episode is a duck how are you supposed
 

5265
01:45:19,260 --> 01:45:21,229
episode is a duck how are you supposed
to train if you have a neural network

5266
01:45:21,229 --> 01:45:21,239
to train if you have a neural network
 

5267
01:45:21,239 --> 01:45:22,609
to train if you have a neural network
which is supposed to discriminate

5268
01:45:22,609 --> 01:45:22,619
which is supposed to discriminate
 

5269
01:45:22,619 --> 01:45:24,530
which is supposed to discriminate
between distinguish between ducks and

01:45:24,530 --> 01:45:24,540
between distinguish between ducks and
 

5271
01:45:24,540 --> 01:45:26,450
between distinguish between ducks and
rabbits how is it going to process this

5272
01:45:26,450 --> 01:45:26,460
rabbits how is it going to process this
 

5273
01:45:26,460 --> 01:45:30,290
rabbits how is it going to process this
you see well so the the trivial trick it

5274
01:45:30,290 --> 01:45:30,300
you see well so the the trivial trick it
 

5275
01:45:30,300 --> 01:45:32,689
you see well so the the trivial trick it
does is to say there's a this x

5276
01:45:32,689 --> 01:45:32,699
does is to say there's a this x
 

5277
01:45:32,699 --> 01:45:34,729
does is to say there's a this x
probability there is a duck and this

01:45:34,729 --> 01:45:34,739
probability there is a duck and this
 

5279
01:45:34,739 --> 01:45:36,649
probability there is a duck and this
probability that it's a rabbit but

5280
01:45:36,649 --> 01:45:36,659
probability that it's a rabbit but
 

5281
01:45:36,659 --> 01:45:38,149
probability that it's a rabbit but
that's a good approach but also I would

5282
01:45:38,149 --> 01:45:38,159
that's a good approach but also I would
 

5283
01:45:38,159 --> 01:45:40,669
that's a good approach but also I would
say there's no like given percentages

5284
01:45:40,669 --> 01:45:40,679
say there's no like given percentages
 

5285
01:45:40,679 --> 01:45:43,189
say there's no like given percentages
for instance actually at some point I

5286
01:45:43,189 --> 01:45:43,199
for instance actually at some point I
 

5287
01:45:43,199 --> 01:45:46,970
for instance actually at some point I
was really curious about it and I looked

5288
01:45:46,970 --> 01:45:46,980
was really curious about it and I looked
 

5289
01:45:46,980 --> 01:45:49,970
was really curious about it and I looked
and for some for each picture of this

5290
01:45:49,970 --> 01:45:49,980
and for some for each picture of this
 

5291
01:45:49,980 --> 01:45:51,410
and for some for each picture of this
nature and there are a bunch of them you

5292
01:45:51,410 --> 01:45:51,420
nature and there are a bunch of them you
 

5293
01:45:51,420 --> 01:45:53,149
nature and there are a bunch of them you
can easily find online

5294
01:45:53,149 --> 01:45:53,159
can easily find online

01:45:53,159 --> 01:45:56,270
can easily find online
my mind immediately interprets it in a

5296
01:45:56,270 --> 01:45:56,280
my mind immediately interprets it in a
 

5297
01:45:56,280 --> 01:45:59,149
my mind immediately interprets it in a
particular way but because I know that

5298
01:45:59,149 --> 01:45:59,159
particular way but because I know that
 

5299
01:45:59,159 --> 01:46:00,709
particular way but because I know that
other people have could see it

5300
01:46:00,709 --> 01:46:00,719
other people have could see it
 

5301
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:02,870
other people have could see it
differently I would then strain my mind

5302
01:46:02,870 --> 01:46:02,880
differently I would then strain my mind
 

5303
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:05,930
differently I would then strain my mind
and strain my eyes and stare at it and

5304
01:46:05,930 --> 01:46:05,940
and strain my eyes and stare at it and
 

5305
01:46:05,940 --> 01:46:07,850
and strain my eyes and stare at it and
try to see it in a different way and

5306
01:46:07,850 --> 01:46:07,860
try to see it in a different way and
 

5307
01:46:07,860 --> 01:46:09,770
try to see it in a different way and
sometimes I could see it right away and

5308
01:46:09,770 --> 01:46:09,780
sometimes I could see it right away and
 

5309
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:11,030
sometimes I could see it right away and
then I could go back and forth between

5310
01:46:11,030 --> 01:46:11,040
then I could go back and forth between
 

5311
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:14,209
then I could go back and forth between
the two and sometimes it could it took

5312
01:46:14,209 --> 01:46:14,219
the two and sometimes it could it took
 

5313
01:46:14,219 --> 01:46:16,370
the two and sometimes it could it took
me a while for some pictures

5314
01:46:16,370 --> 01:46:16,380
me a while for some pictures
 

5315
01:46:16,380 --> 01:46:18,350
me a while for some pictures
so in that sense even if this

5316
01:46:18,350 --> 01:46:18,360
so in that sense even if this
 

5317
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:20,390
so in that sense even if this
probabilities exist they are subjective

5318
01:46:20,390 --> 01:46:20,400
probabilities exist they are subjective
 

5319
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:22,430
probabilities exist they are subjective
some people immediately see it this way

5320
01:46:22,430 --> 01:46:22,440
some people immediately see it this way
 

5321
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:24,229
some people immediately see it this way
some people may see that way and I think

5322
01:46:24,229 --> 01:46:24,239
some people may see that way and I think
 

5323
01:46:24,239 --> 01:46:26,870
some people may see that way and I think
that nobody knows not psychologists not

5324
01:46:26,870 --> 01:46:26,880
that nobody knows not psychologists not
 

5325
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:28,790
that nobody knows not psychologists not
neuroscientists not philosophers what to

5326
01:46:28,790 --> 01:46:28,800
neuroscientists not philosophers what to
 

5327
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,350
neuroscientists not philosophers what to
make of it

5328
01:46:30,350 --> 01:46:30,360
make of it
 

5329
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:33,649
make of it
the best answer the best of course as a

5330
01:46:33,649 --> 01:46:33,659
the best answer the best of course as a
 

5331
01:46:33,659 --> 01:46:35,810
the best answer the best of course as a
scientific mind I will I'm even though I

5332
01:46:35,810 --> 01:46:35,820
scientific mind I will I'm even though I
 

5333
01:46:35,820 --> 01:46:38,030
scientific mind I will I'm even though I
say no don't look for interpretation

5334
01:46:38,030 --> 01:46:38,040
say no don't look for interpretation
 

5335
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:40,070
say no don't look for interpretation
leave some place for mysticism or

5336
01:46:40,070 --> 01:46:40,080
leave some place for mysticism or
 

5337
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:42,410
leave some place for mysticism or
mystery right I say that but of course I

5338
01:46:42,410 --> 01:46:42,420
mystery right I say that but of course I
 

5339
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:45,050
mystery right I say that but of course I
want a theory I want an explanation

5340
01:46:45,050 --> 01:46:45,060
want a theory I want an explanation
 

5341
01:46:45,060 --> 01:46:47,090
want a theory I want an explanation
so the best explanation I find is from

5342
01:46:47,090 --> 01:46:47,100
so the best explanation I find is from
 

5343
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:49,550
so the best explanation I find is from
Niels Bohr's complementarity principle

5344
01:46:49,550 --> 01:46:49,560
Niels Bohr's complementarity principle
 

5345
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:52,189
Niels Bohr's complementarity principle
so it is like particle and wave

5346
01:46:52,189 --> 01:46:52,199
so it is like particle and wave
 

5347
01:46:52,199 --> 01:46:53,810
so it is like particle and wave
that there are different ways to look at

5348
01:46:53,810 --> 01:46:53,820
that there are different ways to look at
 

5349
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:54,470
that there are different ways to look at
it

5350
01:46:54,470 --> 01:46:54,480
it
 

5351
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,390
it
and when you look at it in a particular

5352
01:46:56,390 --> 01:46:56,400
and when you look at it in a particular
 

5353
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:58,790
and when you look at it in a particular
way another side will be obscured think

5354
01:46:58,790 --> 01:46:58,800
way another side will be obscured think
 

5355
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:00,050
way another side will be obscured think
about it like the other side of the moon

5356
01:47:00,050 --> 01:47:00,060
about it like the other side of the moon
 

5357
01:47:00,060 --> 01:47:01,850
about it like the other side of the moon
you know so like we are observing the

5358
01:47:01,850 --> 01:47:01,860
you know so like we are observing the
 

5359
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:04,129
you know so like we are observing the
Moon from one side and then we don't see

5360
01:47:04,129 --> 01:47:04,139
Moon from one side and then we don't see
 

5361
01:47:04,139 --> 01:47:06,410
Moon from one side and then we don't see
the other side there is a complementary

5362
01:47:06,410 --> 01:47:06,420
the other side there is a complementary
 

5363
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:08,209
the other side there is a complementary
perspective where we see the other side

5364
01:47:08,209 --> 01:47:08,219
perspective where we see the other side
 

5365
01:47:08,219 --> 01:47:10,729
perspective where we see the other side
but not the side we normally see but the

5366
01:47:10,729 --> 01:47:10,739
but not the side we normally see but the
 

5367
01:47:10,739 --> 01:47:11,930
but not the side we normally see but the
Moon is the same

5368
01:47:11,930 --> 01:47:11,940
Moon is the same
 

5369
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:15,649
Moon is the same
still there it's our limitations of

5370
01:47:15,649 --> 01:47:15,659
still there it's our limitations of
 

5371
01:47:15,659 --> 01:47:17,689
still there it's our limitations of
being able to grasp the whole

5372
01:47:17,689 --> 01:47:17,699
being able to grasp the whole
 

5373
01:47:17,699 --> 01:47:20,030
being able to grasp the whole
that's complementarity and we know that

5374
01:47:20,030 --> 01:47:20,040
that's complementarity and we know that
 

5375
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:22,790
that's complementarity and we know that
from quantum mechanics that our physical

5376
01:47:22,790 --> 01:47:22,800
from quantum mechanics that our physical
 

5377
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:24,590
from quantum mechanics that our physical
reality is like that

5378
01:47:24,590 --> 01:47:24,600
reality is like that
 

5379
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:26,810
reality is like that

to teach the networks yeah and that's
 

5401
01:47:50,940 --> 01:47:52,189
to teach the networks yeah and that's
the thing that people don't often talk

5402
01:47:52,189 --> 01:47:52,199
the thing that people don't often talk
 

5403
01:47:52,199 --> 01:47:54,470
the thing that people don't often talk

about because

or I I sometimes think about that
 

5407
01:47:57,420 --> 01:48:00,229
or I I sometimes think about that

01:48:34,020 --> 01:48:35,090
implicit in the discussion of the
question

5436
01:48:35,090 --> 01:48:35,100
question
 

5437
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:38,030
question
is thinking computational and so on is

5438
01:48:38,030 --> 01:48:38,040
is thinking computational and so on is
 

5439
01:48:38,040 --> 01:48:40,790
is thinking computational and so on is
the idea that our conscious awareness

5440
01:48:40,790 --> 01:48:40,800
the idea that our conscious awareness
 

5441
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:43,970
the idea that our conscious awareness
covers everything within our psyche and

5442
01:48:43,970 --> 01:48:43,980
covers everything within our psyche and
 

5443
01:48:43,980 --> 01:48:46,490
covers everything within our psyche and
we we just know that that's not the case

5444
01:48:46,490 --> 01:48:46,500
we we just know that that's not the case
 

5445
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:49,430
we we just know that that's not the case
we have all of us have observed uh other

5446
01:48:49,430 --> 01:48:49,440
we have all of us have observed uh other
 

5447
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:51,830
we have all of us have observed uh other
people who have had sort of destructive

5448
01:48:51,830 --> 01:48:51,840
people who have had sort of destructive
 

5449
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:54,050
people who have had sort of destructive
Tendencies so obviously they did things

5450
01:48:54,050 --> 01:48:54,060
Tendencies so obviously they did things
 

5451
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:56,209
Tendencies so obviously they did things
destructive for themselves and many of

5452
01:48:56,209 --> 01:48:56,219
destructive for themselves and many of
 

5453
01:48:56,219 --> 01:48:58,550
destructive for themselves and many of
us have observed ourselves to doing that

5454
01:48:58,550 --> 01:48:58,560
us have observed ourselves to doing that
 

5455
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:01,970
us have observed ourselves to doing that
as part of human nature right so and

5456
01:49:01,970 --> 01:49:01,980
as part of human nature right so and
 

5457
01:49:01,980 --> 01:49:04,250
as part of human nature right so and
there is great research in analytic

5458
01:49:04,250 --> 01:49:04,260
there is great research in analytic
 

5459
01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:06,890
there is great research in analytic
psychology and you know in the past

5460
01:49:06,890 --> 01:49:06,900
psychology and you know in the past
 

5461
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:10,609
psychology and you know in the past
hundred years uh strongly suggesting if

5462
01:49:10,609 --> 01:49:10,619
hundred years uh strongly suggesting if
 

5463
01:49:10,619 --> 01:49:12,350
hundred years uh strongly suggesting if
not proving the existence of what Carl

5464
01:49:12,350 --> 01:49:12,360
not proving the existence of what Carl
 

5465
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:14,270
not proving the existence of what Carl
Jung called the unconscious personal

5466
01:49:14,270 --> 01:49:14,280
Jung called the unconscious personal
 

5467
01:49:14,280 --> 01:49:15,709
Jung called the unconscious personal
unconscious and also Collective

5468
01:49:15,709 --> 01:49:15,719
unconscious and also Collective
 

5469
01:49:15,719 --> 01:49:17,810
unconscious and also Collective
unconscious there's a kind of Circle of

5470
01:49:17,810 --> 01:49:17,820
unconscious there's a kind of Circle of
 

5471
01:49:17,820 --> 01:49:20,810
unconscious there's a kind of Circle of
ideas which are under the radar screen

5472
01:49:20,810 --> 01:49:20,820
ideas which are under the radar screen
 

5473
01:49:20,820 --> 01:49:23,750
ideas which are under the radar screen
which lead us to some strong emotions

5474
01:49:23,750 --> 01:49:23,760
which lead us to some strong emotions
 

5475
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:26,870
which lead us to some strong emotions
and Inspire us to act in certain ways

5476
01:49:26,870 --> 01:49:26,880
and Inspire us to act in certain ways
 

5477
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:29,090
and Inspire us to act in certain ways
even if we cannot really understand

5478
01:49:29,090 --> 01:49:29,100
even if we cannot really understand
 

5479
01:49:29,100 --> 01:49:32,209
even if we cannot really understand
so if we accept that then it the

5480
01:49:32,209 --> 01:49:32,219
so if we accept that then it the
 

5481
01:49:32,219 --> 01:49:34,430
so if we accept that then it the
preposition that somehow everything can

5482
01:49:34,430 --> 01:49:34,440
preposition that somehow everything can
 

5483
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:38,149
preposition that somehow everything can
still be covered by our actions which

5484
01:49:38,149 --> 01:49:38,159
still be covered by our actions which
 

5485
01:49:38,159 --> 01:49:39,290
still be covered by our actions which
are totally

5486
01:49:39,290 --> 01:49:39,300
are totally
 

5487
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:41,450

01:49:47,530 --> 01:49:47,540
tenuous
 

5495
01:49:47,540 --> 01:49:51,649
tenuous
let me ask you some tricky questions oh

5496
01:49:51,649 --> 01:49:51,659
let me ask you some tricky questions oh
 

5497
01:49:51,659 --> 01:49:54,290
let me ask you some tricky questions oh
in in terms of how big they are

5498
01:49:54,290 --> 01:49:54,300
in in terms of how big they are
 

5499
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:56,629
in in terms of how big they are
in terms of how you know they become

5500
01:49:56,629 --> 01:49:56,639
in terms of how you know they become
 

5501
01:49:56,639 --> 01:49:57,830
in terms of how you know they become
difficult because of how much of

5502
01:49:57,830 --> 01:49:57,840
difficult because of how much of
 

5503
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:00,470
difficult because of how much of
romantic you are

5504
01:50:00,470 --> 01:50:00,480
romantic you are
 

5505
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:03,970
romantic you are
what do you uh is the most beautiful

5506
01:50:03,970 --> 01:50:03,980
what do you uh is the most beautiful
 

5507
01:50:03,980 --> 01:50:07,729
what do you uh is the most beautiful
idea in mathematics

5508
01:50:07,729 --> 01:50:07,739
idea in mathematics
 

5509
01:50:07,739 --> 01:50:10,129
idea in mathematics
another one we can ask is which is the

5510
01:50:10,129 --> 01:50:10,139
another one we can ask is which is the
 

5511
01:50:10,139 --> 01:50:12,350
another one we can ask is which is the
most beautiful equation in mathematics

5512
01:50:12,350 --> 01:50:12,360
most beautiful equation in mathematics
 

5513
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:15,530
most beautiful equation in mathematics
hmm

5514
01:50:15,530 --> 01:50:15,540

 

5515
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:18,609

well I mean

5516
01:50:18,609 --> 01:50:18,619
well I mean
 

5517
01:50:18,619 --> 01:50:22,370
well I mean
I may have just broken your brain

5518
01:50:22,370 --> 01:50:22,380
I may have just broken your brain
 

5519
01:50:22,380 --> 01:50:24,770
I may have just broken your brain
because because what your brain is doing

5520
01:50:24,770 --> 01:50:24,780
because because what your brain is doing
 

5521
01:50:24,780 --> 01:50:28,250
because because what your brain is doing
is walking down a long memory lane of

5522
01:50:28,250 --> 01:50:28,260
is walking down a long memory lane of
 

5523
01:50:28,260 --> 01:50:29,750
is walking down a long memory lane of
beautiful experiences

5524
01:50:29,750 --> 01:50:29,760
beautiful experiences
 

5525
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:32,450
beautiful experiences
well you see in mathematics we have this

5526
01:50:32,450 --> 01:50:32,460
well you see in mathematics we have this
 

5527
01:50:32,460 --> 01:50:35,330
well you see in mathematics we have this
idea that that we have an idea of a set

5528
01:50:35,330 --> 01:50:35,340
idea that that we have an idea of a set
 

5529
01:50:35,340 --> 01:50:36,890
idea that that we have an idea of a set
right so it could be a collection of

5530
01:50:36,890 --> 01:50:36,900
right so it could be a collection of
 

5531
01:50:36,900 --> 01:50:38,870
right so it could be a collection of
things for instance you know the set of

5532
01:50:38,870 --> 01:50:38,880
things for instance you know the set of
 

5533
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:41,629
things for instance you know the set of
tables the set of chairs and so on

5534
01:50:41,629 --> 01:50:41,639
tables the set of chairs and so on
 

5535
01:50:41,639 --> 01:50:43,250
tables the set of chairs and so on
outside of microphones

5536
01:50:43,250 --> 01:50:43,260
outside of microphones
 

5537
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:45,590
outside of microphones
but it could be set of numbers

5538
01:50:45,590 --> 01:50:45,600
but it could be set of numbers
 

5539
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:48,290
but it could be set of numbers
could be set of ideas could be a set of

5540
01:50:48,290 --> 01:50:48,300
could be set of ideas could be a set of
 

5541
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:50,990
could be set of ideas could be a set of
formulas mathematical equations and then

5542
01:50:50,990 --> 01:50:51,000
formulas mathematical equations and then
 

5543
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:52,850
formulas mathematical equations and then
we have the notion of an ordered set

5544
01:50:52,850 --> 01:50:52,860
we have the notion of an ordered set
 

5545
01:50:52,860 --> 01:50:54,890
we have the notion of an ordered set
order it like we said in which there is

5546
01:50:54,890 --> 01:50:54,900
order it like we said in which there is
 

5547
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:57,770
order it like we said in which there is
order which means that for every two

5548
01:50:57,770 --> 01:50:57,780
order which means that for every two
 

5549
01:50:57,780 --> 01:50:59,629
order which means that for every two
members of the set we'll say which one

5550
01:50:59,629 --> 01:50:59,639
members of the set we'll say which one
 

5551
01:50:59,639 --> 01:51:01,490
members of the set we'll say which one
is better than the other or greater than

5552
01:51:01,490 --> 01:51:01,500
is better than the other or greater than
 

5553
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:03,470
is better than the other or greater than
the other for instance all numbers are

5554
01:51:03,470 --> 01:51:03,480
the other for instance all numbers are
 

5555
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:04,609
the other for instance all numbers are
ordered

5556
01:51:04,609 --> 01:51:04,619
ordered
 

5557
01:51:04,619 --> 01:51:07,430
ordered
5 is greater than 3 5 is less than 7 and

5558
01:51:07,430 --> 01:51:07,440
5 is greater than 3 5 is less than 7 and
 

5559
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:08,629
5 is greater than 3 5 is less than 7 and
so on

5560
01:51:08,629 --> 01:51:08,639
so on
 

5561
01:51:08,639 --> 01:51:11,450
so on
but not all sets are ordered so the set

5562
01:51:11,450 --> 01:51:11,460
but not all sets are ordered so the set
 

5563
01:51:11,460 --> 01:51:13,189
but not all sets are ordered so the set
of beautiful theorems is not what

5564
01:51:13,189 --> 01:51:13,199
of beautiful theorems is not what
 

5565
01:51:13,199 --> 01:51:16,930
of beautiful theorems is not what
beautiful equations is not ordered

5566
01:51:16,930 --> 01:51:16,940

 

5567
01:51:16,940 --> 01:51:19,189

so in other words there are many best

5568
01:51:19,189 --> 01:51:19,199
so in other words there are many best
 

5569
01:51:19,199 --> 01:51:20,450
so in other words there are many best
equations

5570
01:51:20,450 --> 01:51:20,460
equations
 

5571
01:51:20,460 --> 01:51:22,370
equations
and so

5572
01:51:22,370 --> 01:51:22,380
and so
 

5573
01:51:22,380 --> 01:51:24,430
and so
Richard Feynman

5574
01:51:24,430 --> 01:51:24,440
Richard Feynman
 

5575
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:27,229
Richard Feynman
chose one which I think one of the best

5576
01:51:27,229 --> 01:51:27,239
chose one which I think one of the best
 

5577
01:51:27,239 --> 01:51:30,590
chose one which I think one of the best
is that if you take e the base of

5578
01:51:30,590 --> 01:51:30,600
is that if you take e the base of
 

5579
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:33,229
is that if you take e the base of
natural logarithm to the power Pi I so

5580
01:51:33,229 --> 01:51:33,239
natural logarithm to the power Pi I so
 

5581
01:51:33,239 --> 01:51:35,330
natural logarithm to the power Pi I so
you have Pi you have e in it the base of

5582
01:51:35,330 --> 01:51:35,340
you have Pi you have e in it the base of
 

5583
01:51:35,340 --> 01:51:38,629
you have Pi you have e in it the base of
initial logarithm you have Pi I which is

5584
01:51:38,629 --> 01:51:38,639
initial logarithm you have Pi I which is
 

5585
01:51:38,639 --> 01:51:41,330
initial logarithm you have Pi I which is
square root of negative one

5586
01:51:41,330 --> 01:51:41,340
square root of negative one
 

5587
01:51:41,340 --> 01:51:45,169
square root of negative one
then the result is negative one

5588
01:51:45,169 --> 01:51:45,179
then the result is negative one
 

5589
01:51:45,179 --> 01:51:47,270
then the result is negative one
so that's up there for sure in the

5590
01:51:47,270 --> 01:51:47,280
so that's up there for sure in the
 

5591
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:49,570
so that's up there for sure in the
pantheon of beautiful formulas you know

5592
01:51:49,570 --> 01:51:49,580
pantheon of beautiful formulas you know
 

5593
01:51:49,580 --> 01:51:52,129
pantheon of beautiful formulas you know
that uh every I think pretty much every

5594
01:51:52,129 --> 01:51:52,139
that uh every I think pretty much every
 

5595
01:51:52,139 --> 01:51:54,470
that uh every I think pretty much every
mathematician would agree

5596

mathematician would agree
 

5597
01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:56,149
mathematician would agree
um I don't know what my favorite one is

5598
01:51:56,149 --> 01:51:56,159
um I don't know what my favorite one is
 

5599
01:51:56,159 --> 01:51:59,090
um I don't know what my favorite one is
I just lingering on that one uh Euler's

5600
01:51:59,090 --> 01:51:59,100
I just lingering on that one uh Euler's
 

5601
01:51:59,100 --> 01:52:01,970
I just lingering on that one uh Euler's
identity what makes it beautiful just a

5602
01:52:01,970 --> 01:52:01,980
identity what makes it beautiful just a
 

5603
01:52:01,980 --> 01:52:05,810
identity what makes it beautiful just a
few symbols together right

5604
01:52:05,810 --> 01:52:05,820
few symbols together right
 

5605
01:52:05,820 --> 01:52:07,550
few symbols together right
I mean part of it is actually just

5606
01:52:07,550 --> 01:52:07,560
I mean part of it is actually just
 

5607
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:09,350
I mean part of it is actually just
trying to Define what is beautiful about

5608
01:52:09,350 --> 01:52:09,360
trying to Define what is beautiful about
 

5609
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:10,930
trying to Define what is beautiful about
mathematics

5610
01:52:10,930 --> 01:52:10,940
mathematics
 

5611
01:52:10,940 --> 01:52:13,149
mathematics
that is

5612
01:52:13,149 --> 01:52:13,159
that is
 

5613
01:52:13,159 --> 01:52:15,590
that is
uh Laden there in this particular

5614
01:52:15,590 --> 01:52:15,600
uh Laden there in this particular
 

5615
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:17,330
uh Laden there in this particular
equation that is somehow revealed when

5616
01:52:17,330 --> 01:52:17,340
equation that is somehow revealed when
 

5617
01:52:17,340 --> 01:52:19,450

01:52:19,450 --> 01:52:19,460
the human eye looks at it
 

5619
01:52:19,460 --> 01:52:22,609
the human eye looks at it
why is it beautiful do you think

5620
01:52:22,609 --> 01:52:22,619
why is it beautiful do you think
 

5621
01:52:22,619 --> 01:52:24,229
why is it beautiful do you think
pi

5622
01:52:24,229 --> 01:52:24,239
pi
 

5623
01:52:24,239 --> 01:52:27,350
pi
there is an element of surprise in it

5624
01:52:27,350 --> 01:52:27,360
there is an element of surprise in it
 

5625
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:30,470
there is an element of surprise in it
how is it possible we always think of Pi

5626
01:52:30,470 --> 01:52:30,480
how is it possible we always think of Pi
 

5627
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:32,689
how is it possible we always think of Pi
as the ratio between the circumference

5628
01:52:32,689 --> 01:52:32,699
as the ratio between the circumference
 

5629
01:52:32,699 --> 01:52:35,810
as the ratio between the circumference
of a circle and its diameter

5630
01:52:35,810 --> 01:52:35,820
of a circle and its diameter
 

5631
01:52:35,820 --> 01:52:38,750
of a circle and its diameter
here we are taking some number to the

5632
01:52:38,750 --> 01:52:38,760
here we are taking some number to the
 

5633
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:42,470
here we are taking some number to the
power Pi not even Pi mind you but pi

5634
01:52:42,470 --> 01:52:42,480
power Pi not even Pi mind you but pi
 

5635
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:43,910
power Pi not even Pi mind you but pi
multiplied by square root of negative

5636
01:52:43,910 --> 01:52:43,920
multiplied by square root of negative
 

5637
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:46,990
multiplied by square root of negative
one

5638
01:52:46,990 --> 01:52:47,000

 

5639
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:50,169

surely this is something completely

5640
01:52:50,169 --> 01:52:50,179
surely this is something completely
 

5641
01:52:50,179 --> 01:52:52,430
surely this is something completely
incomprehensible and yet the result is

5642
01:52:52,430 --> 01:52:52,440
incomprehensible and yet the result is
 

5643
01:52:52,440 --> 01:52:53,689
incomprehensible and yet the result is
negative one

5644
01:52:53,689 --> 01:52:53,699
negative one
 

5645
01:52:53,699 --> 01:52:56,750
negative one
you see and if you take e to the power 2

5646
01:52:56,750 --> 01:52:56,760
you see and if you take e to the power 2
 

5647
01:52:56,760 --> 01:53:00,290
you see and if you take e to the power 2
pi I you get one actually one

5648
01:53:00,290 --> 01:53:00,300
pi I you get one actually one
 

5649
01:53:00,300 --> 01:53:02,990
pi I you get one actually one
um so I would guess that that's but in

5650
01:53:02,990 --> 01:53:03,000
um so I would guess that that's but in
 

5651
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,570
um so I would guess that that's but in
other words the initial

5652
01:53:05,570 --> 01:53:05,580
other words the initial
 

5653
01:53:05,580 --> 01:53:07,970
other words the initial
reaction is just that of a surprise I

5654
01:53:07,970 --> 01:53:07,980
reaction is just that of a surprise I
 

5655
01:53:07,980 --> 01:53:11,090
reaction is just that of a surprise I
guess I guess for anyone

5656
01:53:11,090 --> 01:53:11,100
guess I guess for anyone
 

5657
01:53:11,100 --> 01:53:14,629
guess I guess for anyone
who first comes across that these three

5658
01:53:14,629 --> 01:53:14,639
who first comes across that these three
 

5659
01:53:14,639 --> 01:53:17,930
who first comes across that these three
folks four folks got together yeah it uh

5660
01:53:17,930 --> 01:53:17,940
folks four folks got together yeah it uh
 

5661
01:53:17,940 --> 01:53:19,609
folks four folks got together yeah it uh
it reminds me of the

5662
01:53:19,609 --> 01:53:19,619
it reminds me of the
 

5663
01:53:19,619 --> 01:53:23,390
it reminds me of the
the idea that uh Hitler's Stalin Trotsky

5664
01:53:23,390 --> 01:53:23,400
the idea that uh Hitler's Stalin Trotsky
 

5665
01:53:23,400 --> 01:53:25,550
the idea that uh Hitler's Stalin Trotsky
and Freud were all in Vienna in some

5666
01:53:25,550 --> 01:53:25,560
and Freud were all in Vienna in some
 

5667
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:27,890
and Freud were all in Vienna in some
early at the beginning of the 20th and

5668
01:53:27,890 --> 01:53:27,900
early at the beginning of the 20th and
 

5669
01:53:27,900 --> 01:53:30,410
early at the beginning of the 20th and
business Stein was was classmate of of

5670
01:53:30,410 --> 01:53:30,420
business Stein was was classmate of of
 

5671
01:53:30,420 --> 01:53:32,510
business Stein was was classmate of of
Hitler you know this I did not know this

5672
01:53:32,510 --> 01:53:32,520
Hitler you know this I did not know this
 

5673
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:35,209
Hitler you know this I did not know this
though yeah so there it makes you you

5674
01:53:35,209 --> 01:53:35,219
though yeah so there it makes you you
 

5675
01:53:35,219 --> 01:53:37,010
though yeah so there it makes you you
know you can imagine a situation where

5676
01:53:37,010 --> 01:53:37,020
know you can imagine a situation where
 

5677
01:53:37,020 --> 01:53:38,750
know you can imagine a situation where
they're all sitting at a bar together

5678
01:53:38,750 --> 01:53:38,760
they're all sitting at a bar together
 

5679
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:41,510
they're all sitting at a bar together
at some point not knowing it but they

5680
01:53:41,510 --> 01:53:41,520
at some point not knowing it but they
 

5681
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:43,790
at some point not knowing it but they
somehow it all made sense in space time

5682
01:53:43,790 --> 01:53:43,800
somehow it all made sense in space time
 

5683
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:46,490
somehow it all made sense in space time
to be located there and that's what this

5684
01:53:46,490 --> 01:53:46,500
to be located there and that's what this
 

5685
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:47,870
to be located there and that's what this
feels like some kind of intersection

5686
01:53:47,870 --> 01:53:47,880
feels like some kind of intersection
 

5687
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:51,010
feels like some kind of intersection
intersection yes but I would say that

5688
01:53:51,010 --> 01:53:51,020
intersection yes but I would say that
 

5689
01:53:51,020 --> 01:53:54,470
intersection yes but I would say that
after the initial shock you you look at

5690
01:53:54,470 --> 01:53:54,480
after the initial shock you you look at
 

5691
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:56,930
after the initial shock you you look at
the proof of this equation and it

5692
01:53:56,930 --> 01:53:56,940
the proof of this equation and it
 

5693
01:53:56,940 --> 01:53:59,149
the proof of this equation and it
actually does make sense and actually it

5694
01:53:59,149 --> 01:53:59,159
actually does make sense and actually it
 

5695
01:53:59,159 --> 01:54:02,750
actually does make sense and actually it
is is nothing but the statement that the

5696
01:54:02,750 --> 01:54:02,760
is is nothing but the statement that the
 

5697
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:04,729
is is nothing but the statement that the
circumference of the circle is

5698
01:54:04,729 --> 01:54:04,739
circumference of the circle is
 

5699
01:54:04,739 --> 01:54:06,770
circumference of the circle is
and in fact in this case it's the

5700
01:54:06,770 --> 01:54:06,780
and in fact in this case it's the
 

5701
01:54:06,780 --> 01:54:08,629
and in fact in this case it's the
circumference of a semicircle is equal

5702
01:54:08,629 --> 01:54:08,639
circumference of a semicircle is equal
 

5703
01:54:08,639 --> 01:54:11,209
circumference of a semicircle is equal
to 2 pi and that's where it comes from

5704
01:54:11,209 --> 01:54:11,219
to 2 pi and that's where it comes from
 

5705
01:54:11,219 --> 01:54:14,510
to 2 pi and that's where it comes from
in the end the truth is simple in the

5706
01:54:14,510 --> 01:54:14,520
in the end the truth is simple in the
 

5707
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:16,010
in the end the truth is simple in the
end it was a simple not necessarily easy

5708
01:54:16,010 --> 01:54:16,020
end it was a simple not necessarily easy
 

5709
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:17,450
end it was a simple not necessarily easy
but simple

5710
01:54:17,450 --> 01:54:17,460
but simple
 

5711
01:54:17,460 --> 01:54:19,970
but simple
so uh I mentioned to you Offline that I

5712
01:54:19,970 --> 01:54:19,980
so uh I mentioned to you Offline that I
 

5713
01:54:19,980 --> 01:54:23,330
so uh I mentioned to you Offline that I
uh desperately in trying to figure out

5714
01:54:23,330 --> 01:54:23,340
uh desperately in trying to figure out

01:54:26,450 --> 01:54:26,460
the optimal in an audit set questions to
 

5717
01:54:26,460 --> 01:54:29,510
the optimal in an audit set questions to
ask you uh texted Eric Weinstein asking

5718
01:54:29,510 --> 01:54:29,520
ask you uh texted Eric Weinstein asking
 

5719
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:32,390
ask you uh texted Eric Weinstein asking
for what questions he can ask you and he

5720
01:54:32,390 --> 01:54:32,400
for what questions he can ask you and he
 

5721
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:35,109
for what questions he can ask you and he
said that you are

5722
01:54:35,109 --> 01:54:35,119
said that you are
 

5723
01:54:35,119 --> 01:54:37,330
said that you are
definitively one of the greatest living

5724
01:54:37,330 --> 01:54:37,340
definitively one of the greatest living
 

5725
01:54:37,340 --> 01:54:39,970
definitively one of the greatest living
mathematicians so don't screw this up

5726
01:54:39,970 --> 01:54:39,980
mathematicians so don't screw this up
 

5727
01:54:39,980 --> 01:54:43,790
mathematicians so don't screw this up
but you did give me a few questions

5728
01:54:43,790 --> 01:54:43,800
but you did give me a few questions
 

5729
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:46,910
but you did give me a few questions
um so he asks uh to ask you what are the

5730
01:54:46,910 --> 01:54:46,920
um so he asks uh to ask you what are the
 

5731
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:48,950
um so he asks uh to ask you what are the
most shockingly passionate this is in

5732
01:54:48,950 --> 01:54:48,960
most shockingly passionate this is in
 

5733
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:50,750
most shockingly passionate this is in
Eric's language what are the most

5734
01:54:50,750 --> 01:54:50,760
Eric's language what are the most
 

5735
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:52,729
Eric's language what are the most
shockingly passionate mathematical

day I suppose we'll have a debate and so
 

6389
02:07:37,619 --> 02:07:39,229
day I suppose we'll have a debate and so
you have this

6390
02:07:39,229 --> 02:07:39,239
you have this
 

6391
02:07:39,239 --> 02:07:41,149
you have this
um one person says this and then yeah

6392
02:07:41,149 --> 02:07:41,159
um one person says this and then yeah
 

6393
02:07:41,159 --> 02:07:43,430
um one person says this and then yeah
and what I learned is that it never it's

6394
02:07:43,430 --> 02:07:43,440
and what I learned is that it never it's
 

6395
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:45,830
and what I learned is that it never it's
a never-ending con this conflict just

6396
02:07:45,830 --> 02:07:45,840
a never-ending con this conflict just
 

6397
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:47,689
a never-ending con this conflict just
does not end

6398
02:07:47,689 --> 02:07:47,699
does not end
 

6399
02:07:47,699 --> 02:07:49,430
does not end
but there is an alternative there is a

6400
02:07:49,430 --> 02:07:49,440
but there is an alternative there is a
 

6401
02:07:49,440 --> 02:07:50,510
but there is an alternative there is a
better way

6402
02:07:50,510 --> 02:07:50,520
better way
 

6403
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:52,669
better way
which is to realize that it is you

6404
02:07:52,669 --> 02:07:52,679
which is to realize that it is you
 

6405
02:07:52,679 --> 02:07:55,010
which is to realize that it is you
arguing with yourself

6406
02:07:55,010 --> 02:07:55,020
arguing with yourself
 

6407
02:07:55,020 --> 02:07:57,169
arguing with yourself
now if you want to continue arguing with

6408
02:07:57,169 --> 02:07:57,179
now if you want to continue arguing with
 

6409
02:07:57,179 --> 02:07:58,729
now if you want to continue arguing with
yourself

6410
02:07:58,729 --> 02:07:58,739
yourself
 

6411
02:07:58,739 --> 02:08:01,729
yourself
continue as long as you need

6412
02:08:01,729 --> 02:08:01,739
continue as long as you need
 

6413
02:08:01,739 --> 02:08:03,830
continue as long as you need
just be careful not to destroy too many

6414
02:08:03,830 --> 02:08:03,840
just be careful not to destroy too many
 

6415
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:05,750
just be careful not to destroy too many
things you know in the process but there

6416
02:08:05,750 --> 02:08:05,760
things you know in the process but there
 

6417
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:08,510
things you know in the process but there
is an option of actually dropping it of

6418
02:08:08,510 --> 02:08:08,520
is an option of actually dropping it of
 

6419
02:08:08,520 --> 02:08:10,669
is an option of actually dropping it of
actually dropping it this is so I was so

6420
02:08:10,669 --> 02:08:10,679
actually dropping it this is so I was so
 

6421
02:08:10,679 --> 02:08:12,109
actually dropping it this is so I was so
surprised by this

6422
02:08:12,109 --> 02:08:12,119
surprised by this
 

6423
02:08:12,119 --> 02:08:14,689
surprised by this
yeah it's discovering in yourself the

6424
02:08:14,689 --> 02:08:14,699
yeah it's discovering in yourself the
 

6425
02:08:14,699 --> 02:08:16,850
yeah it's discovering in yourself the
capacity the human capacity for

6426
02:08:16,850 --> 02:08:16,860
capacity the human capacity for
 

6427
02:08:16,860 --> 02:08:19,430
capacity the human capacity for
compassion and you understand that

6428
02:08:19,430 --> 02:08:19,440
compassion and you understand that
 

6429
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:21,770
compassion and you understand that
he has a perspective he is operating in

he has a perspective he is operating in
 

6431
02:08:21,780 --> 02:08:23,570
he has a perspective he is operating in
the space of imagination a human being

6432
02:08:23,570 --> 02:08:23,580
the space of imagination a human being
 

6433
02:08:23,580 --> 02:08:25,550
the space of imagination a human being
like you and we're all in this kind of

together
ultimately and also it's like with

6438
02:08:29,629 --> 02:08:29,639
ultimately and also it's like with
 

6439
02:08:29,639 --> 02:08:31,370
ultimately and also it's like with
realizing how much

6440
02:08:31,370 --> 02:08:31,380
realizing how much
 

6441
02:08:31,380 --> 02:08:33,950
realizing how much
I have screwed up you know comes with

6442
02:08:33,950 --> 02:08:33,960
I have screwed up you know comes with
 

6443
02:08:33,960 --> 02:08:36,470
I have screwed up you know comes with
humility also yeah so like I find it

6444
02:08:36,470 --> 02:08:36,480
humility also yeah so like I find it
 

6445
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:38,390

there a way to you know speaking you
 

6459
02:08:51,119 --> 02:08:52,970
there a way to you know speaking you
know since we talked about

6460
02:08:52,970 --> 02:08:52,980
know since we talked about
 

6461
02:08:52,980 --> 02:08:55,550
know since we talked about
um the innocence of a child and how much

6462
02:08:55,550 --> 02:08:55,560
um the innocence of a child and how much
 

6463
02:08:55,560 --> 02:08:58,189
um the innocence of a child and how much
it drives a discovery in science and so

6464
02:08:58,189 --> 02:08:58,199
it drives a discovery in science and so
 

6465
02:08:58,199 --> 02:09:00,229
it drives a discovery in science and so
on you know I remember it was I think I

6466
02:09:00,229 --> 02:09:00,239
on you know I remember it was I think I
 

6467
02:09:00,239 --> 02:09:02,089
on you know I remember it was I think I
heard the Ashanti who gave this nice

6468
02:09:02,089 --> 02:09:02,099
heard the Ashanti who gave this nice
 

6469
02:09:02,099 --> 02:09:04,370
heard the Ashanti who gave this nice
example he's like when you're a kid you

6470
02:09:04,370 --> 02:09:04,380
example he's like when you're a kid you
 

6471
02:09:04,380 --> 02:09:05,870
example he's like when you're a kid you
know you go and you you play with your

6472

want to see you again I just go home
like after half an hour okay what are

6480
02:09:13,129 --> 02:09:13,139
like after half an hour okay what are
 

6481
02:09:13,139 --> 02:09:15,229
like after half an hour okay what are
you gonna do you want to play so you

6482
02:09:15,229 --> 02:09:15,239
you gonna do you want to play so you
 

6483
02:09:15,239 --> 02:09:17,450
you gonna do you want to play so you
come out it's like hey you want to play

6484
02:09:17,450 --> 02:09:17,460
come out it's like hey you want to play
 

6485
02:09:17,460 --> 02:09:19,970
come out it's like hey you want to play
you don't talk about what happened you

6486
02:09:19,970 --> 02:09:19,980
you don't talk about what happened you
 

6487
02:09:19,980 --> 02:09:22,010
you don't talk about what happened you
don't rehash this you know

6488
02:09:22,010 --> 02:09:22,020
don't rehash this you know
 

6489
02:09:22,020 --> 02:09:24,350
don't rehash this you know
let's keep going and sometimes I think

6490
02:09:24,350 --> 02:09:24,360
let's keep going and sometimes I think
 

6491
02:09:24,360 --> 02:09:27,830
let's keep going and sometimes I think
we are on the verge maybe of learning

6492
02:09:27,830 --> 02:09:27,840
we are on the verge maybe of learning
 

6493
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:29,030
we are on the verge maybe of learning
that

6494
02:09:29,030 --> 02:09:29,040
that
 

6495
02:09:29,040 --> 02:09:31,550
that
because I think that if we are can if we

6496
02:09:31,550 --> 02:09:31,560
because I think that if we are can if we
 

6497
02:09:31,560 --> 02:09:33,530
because I think that if we are can if we
continue to push

6498
02:09:33,530 --> 02:09:33,540
continue to push
 

6499
02:09:33,540 --> 02:09:37,430
continue to push
each of us our set of ideas and like

6500
02:09:37,430 --> 02:09:37,440
each of us our set of ideas and like
 

6501
02:09:37,440 --> 02:09:39,530
each of us our set of ideas and like
ideologies and like

6502
02:09:39,530 --> 02:09:39,540
ideologies and like
 

6503
02:09:39,540 --> 02:09:42,290
ideologies and like
you know what matters to us and so on

6504
02:09:42,290 --> 02:09:42,300
you know what matters to us and so on
 

6505
02:09:42,300 --> 02:09:44,570
you know what matters to us and so on
like yeah no no what matters to you but

6506
02:09:44,570 --> 02:09:44,580
like yeah no no what matters to you but
 

6507
02:09:44,580 --> 02:09:47,030
like yeah no no what matters to you but
like there are other ways to approach

6508
02:09:47,030 --> 02:09:47,040
like there are other ways to approach
 

6509
02:09:47,040 --> 02:09:48,530
like there are other ways to approach
other people there are other ways you

6510
02:09:48,530 --> 02:09:48,540
other people there are other ways you
 

6511
02:09:48,540 --> 02:09:50,990
other people there are other ways you
can find point of contact

6512
02:09:50,990 --> 02:09:51,000
can find point of contact
 

6513
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,629
can find point of contact
speaking of which mathematics

6514
02:09:53,629 --> 02:09:53,639
speaking of which mathematics
 

6515
02:09:53,639 --> 02:09:55,729
speaking of which mathematics
mathematical formulas

6516
02:09:55,729 --> 02:09:55,739
mathematical formulas
 

6517
02:09:55,739 --> 02:09:57,950
mathematical formulas
are Universal represent Universal

6518
02:09:57,950 --> 02:09:57,960
are Universal represent Universal
 

6519

you vote for this guy or that guy in the

6522
02:10:02,510 --> 02:10:02,520
you vote for this guy or that guy in the
 

6523
02:10:02,520 --> 02:10:04,790
you vote for this guy or that guy in the
election you know how about that as a

6524
02:10:04,790 --> 02:10:04,800
election you know how about that as a
 

6525
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:08,510
election you know how about that as a
point of of contact of commonality you

6526
02:10:08,510 --> 02:10:08,520
point of of contact of commonality you
 

6527
02:10:08,520 --> 02:10:10,010
point of of contact of commonality you
know and nobody can patent those

6528
02:10:10,010 --> 02:10:10,020
know and nobody can patent those
 

6529
02:10:10,020 --> 02:10:12,109
know and nobody can patent those
formulas did you know that there is a

6530
02:10:12,109 --> 02:10:12,119
formulas did you know that there is a
 

6531
02:10:12,119 --> 02:10:14,390
formulas did you know that there is a
Supreme Court decision that mathematical

6532
02:10:14,390 --> 02:10:14,400
Supreme Court decision that mathematical
 

6533
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:15,890
Supreme Court decision that mathematical
formulas cannot be patented like

6534
02:10:15,890 --> 02:10:15,900
formulas cannot be patented like
 

6535
02:10:15,900 --> 02:10:17,689
formulas cannot be patented like
Einstein could not patent equal E equals

6536
02:10:17,689 --> 02:10:17,699
Einstein could not patent equal E equals
 

6537
02:10:17,699 --> 02:10:19,010

m c squared
it doesn't belong to him because if the

6540
02:10:21,290 --> 02:10:21,300
it doesn't belong to him because if the
 

6541
02:10:21,300 --> 02:10:22,729
it doesn't belong to him because if the
formal is correct

6542
02:10:22,729 --> 02:10:22,739
formal is correct
 

6543
02:10:22,739 --> 02:10:26,510
formal is correct
then it belongs to everyone

6544
02:10:26,510 --> 02:10:26,520

 

6545
02:10:26,520 --> 02:10:28,430

so what do you think of that all too

6546
02:10:28,430 --> 02:10:28,440
so what do you think of that all too
 

6547
02:10:28,440 --> 02:10:30,770
so what do you think of that all too
tricky question and if you want I can

6548
02:10:30,770 --> 02:10:30,780
tricky question and if you want I can
 

6549
02:10:30,780 --> 02:10:33,530
tricky question and if you want I can
deeply bias your answer by giving the

6550
02:10:33,530 --> 02:10:33,540
deeply bias your answer by giving the
 

6551
02:10:33,540 --> 02:10:35,390
deeply bias your answer by giving the
list of four that Eric provided oh no

6552
02:10:35,390 --> 02:10:35,400
list of four that Eric provided oh no
 

6553
02:10:35,400 --> 02:10:37,189
list of four that Eric provided oh no
let me give my mind I cannot see by the

6554
02:10:37,189 --> 02:10:37,199
let me give my mind I cannot see by the
 

6555
02:10:37,199 --> 02:10:39,649
let me give my mind I cannot see by the
way with you yes so but I can guess some

6556
02:10:39,649 --> 02:10:39,659
way with you yes so but I can guess some
 

6557
02:10:39,659 --> 02:10:40,490
way with you yes so but I can guess some
of them

6558
02:10:40,490 --> 02:10:40,500
of them
 

6559
02:10:40,500 --> 02:10:42,530
of them
so I'm going to try to do something

6560
02:10:42,530 --> 02:10:42,540
so I'm going to try to do something
 

6561
02:10:42,540 --> 02:10:43,850
so I'm going to try to do something
different from him so I already

6562
02:10:43,850 --> 02:10:43,860
different from him so I already
 

6563
02:10:43,860 --> 02:10:46,970
different from him so I already
mentioned one which is that you have one

6564
02:10:46,970 --> 02:10:46,980
mentioned one which is that you have one
 

6565
02:10:46,980 --> 02:10:48,229
mentioned one which is that you have one
dimensional

6566
02:10:48,229 --> 02:10:48,239
dimensional
 

6567
02:10:48,239 --> 02:10:50,510
dimensional
um in the medical system which is real

6568
02:10:50,510 --> 02:10:50,520
um in the medical system which is real
 

6569
02:10:50,520 --> 02:10:52,250
um in the medical system which is real
numbers you have two-dimensional which

6570
02:10:52,250 --> 02:10:52,260
numbers you have two-dimensional which
 

6571
02:10:52,260 --> 02:10:53,570
numbers you have two-dimensional which
is complex numbers you have four

6572
02:10:53,570 --> 02:10:53,580
is complex numbers you have four
 

6573
02:10:53,580 --> 02:10:55,310
is complex numbers you have four
dimensional and it's kind of it's

6574
02:10:55,310 --> 02:10:55,320
dimensional and it's kind of it's
 

6575
02:10:55,320 --> 02:10:56,450

02:11:35,570 --> 02:11:35,580
there is a way to make sense of it

there is a way to make sense of it
in which it it comes up to minus one

in which it it comes up to minus one
over twelve

6612
02:11:40,250 --> 02:11:40,260
over twelve
 

6613
02:11:40,260 --> 02:11:42,229
over twelve
how fascinating first of all the answer

6614
02:11:42,229 --> 02:11:42,239
how fascinating first of all the answer
 

6615
02:11:42,239 --> 02:11:44,149
how fascinating first of all the answer
is not even a positive number and it's

6616
02:11:44,149 --> 02:11:44,159
is not even a positive number and it's
 

6617
02:11:44,159 --> 02:11:45,649
is not even a positive number and it's
not an integer it's not a whole number

6618
02:11:45,649 --> 02:11:45,659
not an integer it's not a whole number
 

6619
02:11:45,659 --> 02:11:47,689
not an integer it's not a whole number
it's minus one over twelve so sometimes

6620
02:11:47,689 --> 02:11:47,699
it's minus one over twelve so sometimes
 

6621
02:11:47,699 --> 02:11:48,770
it's minus one over twelve so sometimes
people ask me what is your favorite

6622
02:11:48,770 --> 02:11:48,780
people ask me what is your favorite
 

6623
02:11:48,780 --> 02:11:49,790
people ask me what is your favorite
number

6624
02:11:49,790 --> 02:11:49,800
number
 

6625
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:51,709
number
and it's a kind of a joke I say minus

6626
02:11:51,709 --> 02:11:51,719
and it's a kind of a joke I say minus
 

6627
02:11:51,719 --> 02:11:53,450
and it's a kind of a joke I say minus
one over twelve

6628
02:11:53,450 --> 02:11:53,460
one over twelve
 

6629
02:11:53,460 --> 02:11:56,930
one over twelve
it's actually 42.

6630
02:11:56,930 --> 02:11:56,940

 

6631
02:11:56,940 --> 02:11:58,669

so your favorite number is not an

6632
02:11:58,669 --> 02:11:58,679
so your favorite number is not an
 

6633
02:11:58,679 --> 02:11:59,770
so your favorite number is not an

not because I'm tricking you so you

6660
02:12:36,350 --> 02:12:36,360
not because I'm tricking you so you
 

6661
02:12:36,360 --> 02:12:39,830
not because I'm tricking you so you
start with a a bottle like this or a cup

6662
02:12:39,830 --> 02:12:39,840
start with a a bottle like this or a cup
 

6663
02:12:39,840 --> 02:12:41,689
start with a a bottle like this or a cup
and you start twisting it at the same

6664
02:12:41,689 --> 02:12:41,699
and you start twisting it at the same
 

6665
02:12:41,699 --> 02:12:44,570
and you start twisting it at the same
time you twist your your arm then you

6666
02:12:44,570 --> 02:12:44,580
time you twist your your arm then you
 

6667
02:12:44,580 --> 02:12:47,990
time you twist your your arm then you
come so this is actually going to

6668
02:12:47,990 --> 02:12:48,000
come so this is actually going to
 

6669
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,330
come so this is actually going to
um rotate it 360 Degrees the full turn

6670
02:12:50,330 --> 02:12:50,340
um rotate it 360 Degrees the full turn
 

6671
02:12:50,340 --> 02:12:53,330
um rotate it 360 Degrees the full turn
then you say okay I won't be able to do

6672
02:12:53,330 --> 02:12:53,340
then you say okay I won't be able to do
 

6673
02:12:53,340 --> 02:12:55,010
then you say okay I won't be able to do
another turn because then my arm would

6674
02:12:55,010 --> 02:12:55,020
another turn because then my arm would
 

6675
02:12:55,020 --> 02:12:56,629
another turn because then my arm would
really get twisted I'll have to go see a

this is the pi one of SO3 Eric was
talking about it yes so there is

6684
02:13:06,890 --> 02:13:06,900
talking about it yes so there is
 

6685
02:13:06,900 --> 02:13:08,390
talking about it yes so there is
something where

6686

something where
 

6687
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:10,729
something where
the first motion is not trivial but if

6688
02:13:10,729 --> 02:13:10,739
the first motion is not trivial but if
 

6689
02:13:10,739 --> 02:13:13,250
the first motion is not trivial but if
you double down on it you come back to

6690
02:13:13,250 --> 02:13:13,260
you double down on it you come back to
 

6691
02:13:13,260 --> 02:13:14,810
you double down on it you come back to
the initial position

6692
02:13:14,810 --> 02:13:14,820
the initial position
 

6693
02:13:14,820 --> 02:13:16,729
the initial position
it's a very closely connected to the

6694
02:13:16,729 --> 02:13:16,739
it's a very closely connected to the
 

6695
02:13:16,739 --> 02:13:18,410
it's a very closely connected to the
fact that we have Elementary particles

6696
02:13:18,410 --> 02:13:18,420
fact that we have Elementary particles
 

6697
02:13:18,420 --> 02:13:21,350
fact that we have Elementary particles
of two types bosons and fermions

6698
02:13:21,350 --> 02:13:21,360
of two types bosons and fermions
 

6699
02:13:21,360 --> 02:13:24,109
of two types bosons and fermions
so bosons are for example photons or

6700
02:13:24,109 --> 02:13:24,119
so bosons are for example photons or
 

6701
02:13:24,119 --> 02:13:26,330
so bosons are for example photons or
carriers of other forces or the Higgs

6702
02:13:26,330 --> 02:13:26,340
carriers of other forces or the Higgs
 

6703
02:13:26,340 --> 02:13:28,430
carriers of other forces or the Higgs

called both Einstein statistics but then
 

6713
02:13:40,920 --> 02:13:42,229
called both Einstein statistics but then
there are other particles called

so I can I imagine speaking of
 

6739
02:14:13,380 --> 02:14:14,930
so I can I imagine speaking of
imagination okay yeah so I'm just kind

of briefing on this imagine a world in

6742
02:14:17,629 --> 02:14:17,639
of briefing on this imagine a world in
 

6743
02:14:17,639 --> 02:14:20,450
of briefing on this imagine a world in
which this will not be shocking or like

6744
02:14:20,450 --> 02:14:20,460
which this will not be shocking or like
 

6745
02:14:20,460 --> 02:14:22,129
which this will not be shocking or like
in this case it's not even shocking

6746
02:14:22,129 --> 02:14:22,139
in this case it's not even shocking
 

6747
02:14:22,139 --> 02:14:23,569
in this case it's not even shocking
because I haven't really explained the

6748
02:14:23,569 --> 02:14:23,579
because I haven't really explained the
 

6749
02:14:23,579 --> 02:14:26,149
because I haven't really explained the
details because I can't do it in two

6750
02:14:26,149 --> 02:14:26,159
details because I can't do it in two
 

6751
02:14:26,159 --> 02:14:28,490
details because I can't do it in two
minutes I I indicated

minutes I I indicated
 

6753
02:14:28,500 --> 02:14:31,129
minutes I I indicated
what this is all about and so on

what this is all about and so on
 

6755
02:14:31,139 --> 02:14:34,129
what this is all about and so on
but imagine a world in which this is not

6756
02:14:34,129 --> 02:14:34,139
but imagine a world in which this is not
 

6757
02:14:34,139 --> 02:14:35,569
but imagine a world in which this is not
foreign to most people that most people

6758
02:14:35,569 --> 02:14:35,579
foreign to most people that most people
 

6759
02:14:35,579 --> 02:14:37,310
foreign to most people that most people
have seen it before or they're not

02:14:39,589 --> 02:14:39,599
afraid to approach this type of
 

6763
02:14:39,599 --> 02:14:42,950
afraid to approach this type of
questions because you know we talked a

6764

questions because you know we talked a
 

6765
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:44,569
questions because you know we talked a
little bit about Mass education but I

6766
02:14:44,569 --> 02:14:44,579
little bit about Mass education but I
 

6767
02:14:44,579 --> 02:14:46,430
little bit about Mass education but I
really believe that a lot of people in

6768
02:14:46,430 --> 02:14:46,440
really believe that a lot of people in
 

6769
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:48,950
really believe that a lot of people in
our society and it is not not only in

6770
02:14:48,950 --> 02:14:48,960
our society and it is not not only in
 

6771
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:50,510
our society and it is not not only in
the United States but throughout the

traumatized
 

6777
02:14:53,699 --> 02:14:56,689
traumatized
it's really PTSD that's why people when

6778
02:14:56,689 --> 02:14:56,699
it's really PTSD that's why people when
 

6779
02:14:56,699 --> 02:14:58,370
it's really PTSD that's why people when
they see might make a formula or like

6780
02:14:58,370 --> 02:14:58,380
they see might make a formula or like
 

6781
02:14:58,380 --> 02:15:00,589
they see might make a formula or like
even like how can they need to calculate

6782
02:15:00,589 --> 02:15:00,599
even like how can they need to calculate
 

6783
02:15:00,599 --> 02:15:02,750
even like how can they need to calculate
tip on the bill they it's just they're

6784
02:15:02,750 --> 02:15:02,760
tip on the bill they it's just they're
 

6785
02:15:02,760 --> 02:15:04,609
tip on the bill they it's just they're
terrified because it brings up those

6786
02:15:04,609 --> 02:15:04,619
terrified because it brings up those
 

6787
02:15:04,619 --> 02:15:08,270
terrified because it brings up those
memories when they were kids and being

6788

memories when they were kids and being
 

6789
02:15:08,280 --> 02:15:10,790
memories when they were kids and being
called to Blackboard

6790
02:15:10,790 --> 02:15:10,800
called to Blackboard
 

6791
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:12,589
called to Blackboard
and

6792
02:15:12,589 --> 02:15:12,599
and
 

6793
02:15:12,599 --> 02:15:14,149
and
solve the problem you can't solve a

6794
02:15:14,149 --> 02:15:14,159
solve the problem you can't solve a
 

6795
02:15:14,159 --> 02:15:15,649
solve the problem you can't solve a
problem and as groupless teacher says

6796
02:15:15,649 --> 02:15:15,659
problem and as groupless teacher says
 

6797
02:15:15,659 --> 02:15:17,930
problem and as groupless teacher says
you're an idiot sit down and you feel

6798
02:15:17,930 --> 02:15:17,940
you're an idiot sit down and you feel
 

6799
02:15:17,940 --> 02:15:21,709
you're an idiot sit down and you feel
ashamed and and then lowly and that

6800
02:15:21,709 --> 02:15:21,719
ashamed and and then lowly and that
 

6801
02:15:21,719 --> 02:15:23,510
ashamed and and then lowly and that
stays with you and so I think that

6802
02:15:23,510 --> 02:15:23,520
stays with you and so I think that
 

6803
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:26,229
stays with you and so I think that
unfortunately that's where we are

6804
02:15:26,229 --> 02:15:26,239
unfortunately that's where we are
 

6805
02:15:26,239 --> 02:15:28,910
unfortunately that's where we are
dream and so my dream is that one day

6806
02:15:28,910 --> 02:15:28,920
dream and so my dream is that one day
 

6807
02:15:28,920 --> 02:15:31,250
dream and so my dream is that one day
we'll be able to overcome this

6808
02:15:31,250 --> 02:15:31,260
we'll be able to overcome this
 

6809
02:15:31,260 --> 02:15:33,950
we'll be able to overcome this
and actually all of these Treasures of

6810
02:15:33,950 --> 02:15:33,960
and actually all of these Treasures of
 

6811
02:15:33,960 --> 02:15:35,930
and actually all of these Treasures of
mathematics

6812
02:15:35,930 --> 02:15:35,940
mathematics
 

6813
02:15:35,940 --> 02:15:38,149
mathematics
will become widely widely available or

6814
02:15:38,149 --> 02:15:38,159
will become widely widely available or
 

6815
02:15:38,159 --> 02:15:39,410
will become widely widely available or
at least people will know where to find

6816
02:15:39,410 --> 02:15:39,420
at least people will know where to find
 

6817
02:15:39,420 --> 02:15:40,189

them
 

6819
02:15:40,199 --> 02:15:41,689
them
and they will not be afraid of going

6820
02:15:41,689 --> 02:15:41,699
and they will not be afraid of going
 

6821
02:15:41,699 --> 02:15:43,850
and they will not be afraid of going
there and looking and I think this will

6822
02:15:43,850 --> 02:15:43,860
there and looking and I think this will
 

6823
02:15:43,860 --> 02:15:45,530
there and looking and I think this will
help because like I said for one thing

02:18:00,650 --> 02:18:00,660
but they all combine together into
 

6943
02:18:00,660 --> 02:18:01,610
but they all combine together into
something

6944

not cannot be reduced to any one of
 

6949
02:18:06,660 --> 02:18:08,629
not cannot be reduced to any one of
those so it's the mathematically it's

6950
02:18:08,629 --> 02:18:08,639
those so it's the mathematically it's
 

6951
02:18:08,639 --> 02:18:11,049
those so it's the mathematically it's
the idea that you can decompose a signal

so what language found is that some

6962
02:18:23,929 --> 02:18:23,939
so what language found is that some
 

6963
02:18:23,939 --> 02:18:25,610
so what language found is that some

02:19:35,810 --> 02:19:35,820
um it's sort of
 

7027
02:19:35,820 --> 02:19:38,690
um it's sort of
I always found it interesting

7028
02:19:38,690 --> 02:19:38,700
I always found it interesting
 

7029
02:19:38,700 --> 02:19:42,830
I always found it interesting
to connect things to unite things

7030
02:19:42,830 --> 02:19:42,840
to connect things to unite things
 

7031
02:19:42,840 --> 02:19:45,469
to connect things to unite things
when I was younger I couldn't I couldn't

7032
02:19:45,469 --> 02:19:45,479
when I was younger I couldn't I couldn't
 

7033
02:19:45,479 --> 02:19:46,969
when I was younger I couldn't I couldn't
understand why

7034
02:19:46,969 --> 02:19:46,979
understand why
 

7035
02:19:46,979 --> 02:19:49,730
understand why
but I was always interested in

7036
02:19:49,730 --> 02:19:49,740
but I was always interested in
 

7037
02:19:49,740 --> 02:19:52,190
but I was always interested in
when when not in working in specific

7038
02:19:52,190 --> 02:19:52,200
when when not in working in specific
 

7039
02:19:52,200 --> 02:19:53,389
when when not in working in specific
field

7040
02:19:53,389 --> 02:19:53,399
field
 

7041
02:19:53,399 --> 02:19:55,310
field
by kind of but kind of cutting across

7042
02:19:55,310 --> 02:19:55,320
by kind of but kind of cutting across
 

7043
02:19:55,320 --> 02:19:56,450
by kind of but kind of cutting across
fields

7044
02:19:56,450 --> 02:19:56,460
fields
 

7045
02:19:56,460 --> 02:19:59,090
fields
and um

7046
02:19:59,090 --> 02:19:59,100
and um
 

7047
02:19:59,100 --> 02:20:01,730
and um
and then I we discovered that for

7048
02:20:01,730 --> 02:20:01,740
and then I we discovered that for
 

7049
02:20:01,740 --> 02:20:03,469
and then I we discovered that for
instance I took some people who know

7050
02:20:03,469 --> 02:20:03,479
instance I took some people who know
 

7051
02:20:03,479 --> 02:20:05,510
instance I took some people who know
what happens in this field but

7052
02:20:05,510 --> 02:20:05,520
what happens in this field but
 

7053
02:20:05,520 --> 02:20:07,190
what happens in this field but
don't know what happens in their field

7054
02:20:07,190 --> 02:20:07,200
don't know what happens in their field
 

7055
02:20:07,200 --> 02:20:10,610
don't know what happens in their field
and or conversely and then I would I

7056
02:20:10,610 --> 02:20:10,620
and or conversely and then I would I
 

7057
02:20:10,620 --> 02:20:12,469
and or conversely and then I would I
would like find it

7058
02:20:12,469 --> 02:20:12,479
would like find it
 

7059
02:20:12,479 --> 02:20:14,150
would like find it
imperative

7060
02:20:14,150 --> 02:20:14,160
imperative
 

7061
02:20:14,160 --> 02:20:16,969
imperative
to go out and explain to them to the

7062
02:20:16,969 --> 02:20:16,979
to go out and explain to them to the
 

7063
02:20:16,979 --> 02:20:18,849
to go out and explain to them to the
different sides what this is all about

7064
02:20:18,849 --> 02:20:18,859
different sides what this is all about
 

7065
02:20:18,859 --> 02:20:21,950
different sides what this is all about
so that more people are aware of this

7066
02:20:21,950 --> 02:20:21,960
so that more people are aware of this
 

7067
02:20:21,960 --> 02:20:23,450
so that more people are aware of this
hidden structure so this hidden

7068
02:20:23,450 --> 02:20:23,460
hidden structure so this hidden
 

7069
02:20:23,460 --> 02:20:25,790
hidden structure so this hidden
parallels if you will

7070
02:20:25,790 --> 02:20:25,800
parallels if you will
 

7071
02:20:25,800 --> 02:20:28,610
parallels if you will
so that has been sort of a theme in my

7072
02:20:28,610 --> 02:20:28,620
so that has been sort of a theme in my
 

7073
02:20:28,620 --> 02:20:30,530
so that has been sort of a theme in my
research and so I guess you know now I

7074
02:20:30,530 --> 02:20:30,540
research and so I guess you know now I
 

7075
02:20:30,540 --> 02:20:33,290
research and so I guess you know now I
kind of understand more why it's kind of

7076
02:20:33,290 --> 02:20:33,300
kind of understand more why it's kind of
 

7077
02:20:33,300 --> 02:20:35,750
kind of understand more why it's kind of
a violence you know like what we talked

7078
02:20:35,750 --> 02:20:35,760
a violence you know like what we talked
 

7079
02:20:35,760 --> 02:20:37,010
a violence you know like what we talked
about earlier

7080
02:20:37,010 --> 02:20:37,020
about earlier
 

7081
02:20:37,020 --> 02:20:38,710
about earlier
so can you

7082
02:20:38,710 --> 02:20:38,720
so can you
 

7083
02:20:38,720 --> 02:20:41,870
so can you
elucidate a little bit how what are the

7084
02:20:41,870 --> 02:20:41,880
elucidate a little bit how what are the
 

7085
02:20:41,880 --> 02:20:43,370
elucidate a little bit how what are the
mathematical tools that allow you to

7086
02:20:43,370 --> 02:20:43,380
mathematical tools that allow you to
 

7087
02:20:43,380 --> 02:20:47,090
mathematical tools that allow you to
connect these uh different continents of

7088
02:20:47,090 --> 02:20:47,100
connect these uh different continents of
 

7089
02:20:47,100 --> 02:20:48,530
connect these uh different continents of
mathematics

7090
02:20:48,530 --> 02:20:48,540
mathematics
 

7091
02:20:48,540 --> 02:20:50,809
mathematics
right is there something you can convert

7092
02:20:50,809 --> 02:20:50,819
right is there something you can convert
 

7093
02:20:50,819 --> 02:20:52,910
right is there something you can convert
into words that language was able to

7094
02:20:52,910 --> 02:20:52,920
into words that language was able to
 

7095
02:20:52,920 --> 02:20:54,889
into words that language was able to
find find and you were able to explore

7096
02:20:54,889 --> 02:20:54,899
find find and you were able to explore
 

7097
02:20:54,899 --> 02:20:56,510
find find and you were able to explore
further

7098
02:20:56,510 --> 02:20:56,520
further
 

7099
02:20:56,520 --> 02:20:58,790
further
I would say what it suggests is that

7100
02:20:58,790 --> 02:20:58,800
I would say what it suggests is that
 

7101
02:20:58,800 --> 02:21:01,190
I would say what it suggests is that
there is some and a hidden principles

7102
02:21:01,190 --> 02:21:01,200
there is some and a hidden principles
 

7103
02:21:01,200 --> 02:21:03,290
there is some and a hidden principles
which we still don't understand my my

7104
02:21:03,290 --> 02:21:03,300
which we still don't understand my my
 

7105
02:21:03,300 --> 02:21:06,050
which we still don't understand my my
view is that we still don't know why

7106
02:21:06,050 --> 02:21:06,060
view is that we still don't know why
 

7107
02:21:06,060 --> 02:21:10,010
view is that we still don't know why
that we can prove some instances of this

7108
02:21:10,010 --> 02:21:10,020
that we can prove some instances of this
 

7109
02:21:10,020 --> 02:21:13,849
that we can prove some instances of this
uh correspondences and connections

7110
02:21:13,849 --> 02:21:13,859
uh correspondences and connections
 

7111
02:21:13,859 --> 02:21:15,830
uh correspondences and connections
but we still don't know the real

7112
02:21:15,830 --> 02:21:15,840
but we still don't know the real
 

7113
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:17,510
but we still don't know the real
underlying reasons which means that

7114
02:21:17,510 --> 02:21:17,520
underlying reasons which means that
 

7115
02:21:17,520 --> 02:21:18,950
underlying reasons which means that
there is a newly there is a certain

7116
02:21:18,950 --> 02:21:18,960
there is a newly there is a certain
 

7117
02:21:18,960 --> 02:21:20,330
there is a newly there is a certain
layer

7118
02:21:20,330 --> 02:21:20,340
layer
 

7119
02:21:20,340 --> 02:21:23,349
layer
beneath the surface that we see now

7120
02:21:23,349 --> 02:21:23,359
beneath the surface that we see now
 

7121
02:21:23,359 --> 02:21:25,790
beneath the surface that we see now
it is like the so the way I see it now

7122
02:21:25,790 --> 02:21:25,800
it is like the so the way I see it now
 

7123
02:21:25,800 --> 02:21:26,929
it is like the so the way I see it now
is like this

7124
02:21:26,929 --> 02:21:26,939
is like this
 

7125
02:21:26,939 --> 02:21:28,389
is like this
that there is something

7126
02:21:28,389 --> 02:21:28,399
that there is something
 

7127
02:21:28,399 --> 02:21:30,770
that there is something
three-dimensional like this bottle but

7128
02:21:30,770 --> 02:21:30,780
three-dimensional like this bottle but
 

7129
02:21:30,780 --> 02:21:32,330
three-dimensional like this bottle but
what we are seeing is this projection

7130
02:21:32,330 --> 02:21:32,340
what we are seeing is this projection
 

7131
02:21:32,340 --> 02:21:34,309
what we are seeing is this projection
onto the table and projection to wall

7132
02:21:34,309 --> 02:21:34,319
onto the table and projection to wall
 

7133
02:21:34,319 --> 02:21:36,650
onto the table and projection to wall
and then we can map things from one

7134
02:21:36,650 --> 02:21:36,660
and then we can map things from one
 

7135
02:21:36,660 --> 02:21:38,210
and then we can map things from one
projection to another and say oh my God

7136
02:21:38,210 --> 02:21:38,220
projection to another and say oh my God
 

7137
02:21:38,220 --> 02:21:39,770
projection to another and say oh my God
that's incredible

7138
02:21:39,770 --> 02:21:39,780
that's incredible
 

7139
02:21:39,780 --> 02:21:42,050
that's incredible
but the real explanation is that both of

7140
02:21:42,050 --> 02:21:42,060
but the real explanation is that both of
 

7141
02:21:42,060 --> 02:21:43,670
but the real explanation is that both of
them are projections of the same thing

7142
02:21:43,670 --> 02:21:43,680
them are projections of the same thing
 

7143
02:21:43,680 --> 02:21:45,889
them are projections of the same thing
and that we haven't found yet but that's

7144
02:21:45,889 --> 02:21:45,899
and that we haven't found yet but that's
 

7145
02:21:45,899 --> 02:21:47,150
and that we haven't found yet but that's
what I want to find so that's what

7146
02:21:47,150 --> 02:21:47,160
what I want to find so that's what
 

7147
02:21:47,160 --> 02:21:50,090
what I want to find so that's what
motivates me I would say

7148
02:21:50,090 --> 02:21:50,100
motivates me I would say
 

7149
02:21:50,100 --> 02:21:52,490
motivates me I would say
from number Theory to Geometry to

7150
02:21:52,490 --> 02:21:52,500
from number Theory to Geometry to
 

7151
02:21:52,500 --> 02:21:54,290
from number Theory to Geometry to
quantum physics so there is this one

7152
02:21:54,290 --> 02:21:54,300
quantum physics so there is this one
 

7153
02:21:54,300 --> 02:21:56,270
quantum physics so there is this one
thing which has different projections

7154
02:21:56,270 --> 02:21:56,280
thing which has different projections
 

7155
02:21:56,280 --> 02:21:58,730
thing which has different projections
except it's not just a table and the

7156
02:21:58,730 --> 02:21:58,740
except it's not just a table and the
 

7157
02:21:58,740 --> 02:22:00,830
except it's not just a table and the
wall but they're like many different

7158
02:22:00,830 --> 02:22:00,840
wall but they're like many different
 

7159
02:22:00,840 --> 02:22:02,690
wall but they're like many different
walls if you will

7160
02:22:02,690 --> 02:22:02,700
walls if you will
 

7161
02:22:02,700 --> 02:22:05,210
walls if you will
so what is the philosophical implication

7162
02:22:05,210 --> 02:22:05,220
so what is the philosophical implication
 

7163
02:22:05,220 --> 02:22:08,270
so what is the philosophical implication
that there is commonalities like that

7164
02:22:08,270 --> 02:22:08,280
that there is commonalities like that
 

7165
02:22:08,280 --> 02:22:10,910
that there is commonalities like that
across these very desperate fields

7166
02:22:10,910 --> 02:22:10,920
across these very desperate fields
 

7167
02:22:10,920 --> 02:22:13,429
across these very desperate fields
it means that what we believe are the

7168
02:22:13,429 --> 02:22:13,439
it means that what we believe are the
 

7169
02:22:13,439 --> 02:22:15,170
it means that what we believe are the
fundamental elements of

7170
02:22:15,170 --> 02:22:15,180
fundamental elements of
 

7171
02:22:15,180 --> 02:22:18,349
fundamental elements of
uh of mathematics are not fundamental

7172
02:22:18,349 --> 02:22:18,359
uh of mathematics are not fundamental
 

7173
02:22:18,359 --> 02:22:21,050
uh of mathematics are not fundamental
there is something Beyond it's like we

7174
02:22:21,050 --> 02:22:21,060
there is something Beyond it's like we
 

7175
02:22:21,060 --> 02:22:23,210
there is something Beyond it's like we
previously thought that atoms were

7176
02:22:23,210 --> 02:22:23,220
previously thought that atoms were
 

7177
02:22:23,220 --> 02:22:24,349
previously thought that atoms were
indivisible

7178
02:22:24,349 --> 02:22:24,359
indivisible
 

7179
02:22:24,359 --> 02:22:26,510
indivisible
then we found out that there is nucleus

7180
02:22:26,510 --> 02:22:26,520
then we found out that there is nucleus
 

7181
02:22:26,520 --> 02:22:28,490
then we found out that there is nucleus
and electrons and the nucleus consist of

7182
02:22:28,490 --> 02:22:28,500
and electrons and the nucleus consist of
 

7183
02:22:28,500 --> 02:22:30,230
and electrons and the nucleus consist of
protons and neutrons then we thought

7184
02:22:30,230 --> 02:22:30,240
protons and neutrons then we thought
 

7185
02:22:30,240 --> 02:22:31,910
protons and neutrons then we thought
okay protons and neutrons must be

7186
02:22:31,910 --> 02:22:31,920
okay protons and neutrons must be
 

7187
02:22:31,920 --> 02:22:33,050
okay protons and neutrons must be
Elementary

7188
02:22:33,050 --> 02:22:33,060
Elementary
 

7189
02:22:33,060 --> 02:22:35,750
Elementary
now we know they consist of quarks

7190
02:22:35,750 --> 02:22:35,760
now we know they consist of quarks
 

7191
02:22:35,760 --> 02:22:38,150
now we know they consist of quarks
so it's about kind of finding the quarks

7192
02:22:38,150 --> 02:22:38,160
so it's about kind of finding the quarks
 

7193
02:22:38,160 --> 02:22:40,190
so it's about kind of finding the quarks
of mathematics

7194
02:22:40,190 --> 02:22:40,200
of mathematics
 

7195
02:22:40,200 --> 02:22:42,230
of mathematics
of course beyond that there's maybe even

7196
02:22:42,230 --> 02:22:42,240
of course beyond that there's maybe even
 

7197
02:22:42,240 --> 02:22:44,450
of course beyond that there's maybe even
more which was my initial motivation to

7198
02:22:44,450 --> 02:22:44,460
more which was my initial motivation to
 

7199
02:22:44,460 --> 02:22:46,870
more which was my initial motivation to
study mathematics by the way right so

7200
02:22:46,870 --> 02:22:46,880
study mathematics by the way right so
 

7201
02:22:46,880 --> 02:22:49,070
study mathematics by the way right so
quarks was the first time you fell in

7202
02:22:49,070 --> 02:22:49,080
quarks was the first time you fell in
 

7203
02:22:49,080 --> 02:22:50,510
quarks was the first time you fell in
love with understanding the nature of

7204
02:22:50,510 --> 02:22:50,520
love with understanding the nature of
 

7205
02:22:50,520 --> 02:22:52,010
love with understanding the nature of
reality yeah

7206
02:22:52,010 --> 02:22:52,020
reality yeah
 

7207
02:22:52,020 --> 02:22:53,929
reality yeah
what was it like working with Ed Whitton

7208
02:22:53,929 --> 02:22:53,939
what was it like working with Ed Whitton
 

7209
02:22:53,939 --> 02:22:57,410
what was it like working with Ed Whitton
who uh many people say is one of the

7210
02:22:57,410 --> 02:22:57,420
who uh many people say is one of the
 

7211
02:22:57,420 --> 02:22:58,370
who uh many people say is one of the
smartest

7212
02:22:58,370 --> 02:22:58,380
smartest
 

7213
02:22:58,380 --> 02:23:00,670
smartest
humans in history

7214
02:23:00,670 --> 02:23:00,680
humans in history
 

7215
02:23:00,680 --> 02:23:04,010
humans in history
or at least mathematical physicists in

7216
02:23:04,010 --> 02:23:04,020
or at least mathematical physicists in
 

7217
02:23:04,020 --> 02:23:05,030

yes fascinating I enjoy I enjoyed it

7220
02:23:08,330 --> 02:23:08,340
yes fascinating I enjoy I enjoyed it
 

7221
02:23:08,340 --> 02:23:10,490
yes fascinating I enjoy I enjoyed it
very much I also felt they have to keep

7222
02:23:10,490 --> 02:23:10,500
very much I also felt they have to keep
 

7223
02:23:10,500 --> 02:23:14,510
very much I also felt they have to keep
up you know and uh so we wrote this long

7224
02:23:14,510 --> 02:23:14,520
up you know and uh so we wrote this long
 

7225
02:23:14,520 --> 02:23:17,510
up you know and uh so we wrote this long
paper and in 2007 and we collaborated

7226
02:23:17,510 --> 02:23:17,520
paper and in 2007 and we collaborated
 

7227
02:23:17,520 --> 02:23:19,070
paper and in 2007 and we collaborated
for about a year

7228
02:23:19,070 --> 02:23:19,080
for about a year
 

7229
02:23:19,080 --> 02:23:22,010
for about a year
I have known him before and we talked

7230
02:23:22,010 --> 02:23:22,020
I have known him before and we talked
 

7231
02:23:22,020 --> 02:23:24,590
I have known him before and we talked
before and we have seen him since and we

7232
02:23:24,590 --> 02:23:24,600
before and we have seen him since and we
 

7233
02:23:24,600 --> 02:23:26,809
before and we have seen him since and we
talked but it's very different to just

7234
02:23:26,809 --> 02:23:26,819
talked but it's very different to just
 

7235
02:23:26,819 --> 02:23:28,429
talked but it's very different to just
meet somebody at conferences and have a

7236
02:23:28,429 --> 02:23:28,439
meet somebody at conferences and have a
 

7237
02:23:28,439 --> 02:23:30,590
meet somebody at conferences and have a
conversation

7238
02:23:30,590 --> 02:23:30,600
conversation
 

7239
02:23:30,600 --> 02:23:32,870
conversation
as opposed to actually working on the

7240
02:23:32,870 --> 02:23:32,880
as opposed to actually working on the
 

7241
02:23:32,880 --> 02:23:34,309
as opposed to actually working on the
project together

7242
02:23:34,309 --> 02:23:34,319
project together
 

7243
02:23:34,319 --> 02:23:37,969
project together
so he's very very very very serious very

7244
02:23:37,969 --> 02:23:37,979
so he's very very very very serious very
 

7245
02:23:37,979 --> 02:23:39,590
so he's very very very very serious very
focused this is one thing which I have

7246
02:23:39,590 --> 02:23:39,600
focused this is one thing which I have
 

7247
02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:43,130
focused this is one thing which I have
to say I was really struck by this why

7248
02:23:43,130 --> 02:23:43,140
to say I was really struck by this why
 

7249
02:23:43,140 --> 02:23:44,990
to say I was really struck by this why
is he considered to be

7250
02:23:44,990 --> 02:23:45,000
is he considered to be
 

7251
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:48,590
is he considered to be
such a powerful intellect by many other

7252
02:23:48,590 --> 02:23:48,600
such a powerful intellect by many other
 

7253
02:23:48,600 --> 02:23:51,590
such a powerful intellect by many other
powerful intellects

7254
02:23:51,590 --> 02:23:51,600
powerful intellects
 

7255
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:54,530
powerful intellects
he had uh he has had this unique vision

7256
02:23:54,530 --> 02:23:54,540
he had uh he has had this unique vision
 

7257
02:23:54,540 --> 02:23:56,210
he had uh he has had this unique vision
of the subject

7258
02:23:56,210 --> 02:23:56,220
of the subject
 

7259
02:23:56,220 --> 02:24:00,250
of the subject
he was able to connect different things

7260
02:24:00,250 --> 02:24:00,260
he was able to connect different things
 

7261
02:24:00,260 --> 02:24:01,969
he was able to connect different things
especially

7262
02:24:01,969 --> 02:24:01,979
especially
 

7263
02:24:01,979 --> 02:24:04,969
especially
find connections between quantum physics

02:24:11,389 --> 02:24:11,399
anyone comes close in some sense in the
 

7271
02:24:11,399 --> 02:24:12,410
anyone comes close in some sense in the
last

7272
02:24:12,410 --> 02:24:12,420

uh you know 50 years to him in terms of

7274
02:24:15,469 --> 02:24:15,479
uh you know 50 years to him in terms of
 

7275
02:24:15,479 --> 02:24:18,170
uh you know 50 years to him in terms of
finding just consistently time after

7276
02:24:18,170 --> 02:24:18,180
finding just consistently time after
 

7277
02:24:18,180 --> 02:24:20,150

time breaking around new ground new
 

7279
02:24:20,160 --> 02:24:24,170
time breaking around new ground new
ground so it it would basically one way

7280
02:24:24,170 --> 02:24:24,180
ground so it it would basically one way
 

7281
02:24:24,180 --> 02:24:25,969
ground so it it would basically one way
one could describe it is

he would take some idea in physics

7284
02:24:29,990 --> 02:24:30,000
he would take some idea in physics
 

7285
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,570
he would take some idea in physics
and and then

7286
02:24:32,570 --> 02:24:32,580
and and then
 

7287
02:24:32,580 --> 02:24:34,550
and and then
find an interpretation of it in

7288
02:24:34,550 --> 02:24:34,560
find an interpretation of it in
 

7289
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:35,809
find an interpretation of it in
mathematics

and then say distill it present it in

7292
02:24:39,650 --> 02:24:39,660
and then say distill it present it in
 

7293
02:24:39,660 --> 02:24:40,670
and then say distill it present it in
mathematical terms and tell

7294
02:24:40,670 --> 02:24:40,680
mathematical terms and tell
 

7295
02:24:40,680 --> 02:24:42,950
mathematical terms and tell
mathematicians this should be like that

7296
02:24:42,950 --> 02:24:42,960
mathematicians this should be like that
 

7297
02:24:42,960 --> 02:24:45,290
mathematicians this should be like that
you know kind of like one plus two plus

7298
02:24:45,290 --> 02:24:45,300
you know kind of like one plus two plus
 

7299
02:24:45,300 --> 02:24:47,510
you know kind of like one plus two plus
three plus four is minus 1 over 12.

7300
02:24:47,510 --> 02:24:47,520
three plus four is minus 1 over 12.
 

7301

7303
02:24:51,500 --> 02:24:53,210
I might think she'd be like no way
and then

7304
02:24:53,210 --> 02:24:53,220
and then
 

7305
02:24:53,220 --> 02:24:55,130
and then
it would pan out and mathematicians

7306
02:24:55,130 --> 02:24:55,140
it would pan out and mathematicians
 

7307
02:24:55,140 --> 02:24:57,590
it would pan out and mathematicians
would then like like a whole industry

7308
02:24:57,590 --> 02:24:57,600
would then like like a whole industry
 

7309
02:24:57,600 --> 02:24:59,570
would then like like a whole industry

7351
02:25:46,620 --> 02:25:48,050
becomes a practitioner of the subject
practically

7352
02:25:48,050 --> 02:25:48,060
practically
 

7353
02:25:48,060 --> 02:25:51,230
practically
and then use it to gain some new

7354
02:25:51,230 --> 02:25:51,240
and then use it to gain some new
 

7355
02:25:51,240 --> 02:25:53,570
and then use it to gain some new
insights on the physics side

7356
02:25:53,570 --> 02:25:53,580
insights on the physics side
 

7357
02:25:53,580 --> 02:25:56,570
insights on the physics side
now of course the thing is that the

7358
02:25:56,570 --> 02:25:56,580
now of course the thing is that the
 

7359
02:25:56,580 --> 02:25:59,030
now of course the thing is that the
theory is that physics one could say is

7360
02:25:59,030 --> 02:25:59,040
theory is that physics one could say is
 

7361
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:00,650
theory is that physics one could say is
an assault of a crisis in some sense

7362
02:26:00,650 --> 02:26:00,660
an assault of a crisis in some sense
 

7363
02:26:00,660 --> 02:26:04,610
an assault of a crisis in some sense
because of a current gap between the

7364
02:26:04,610 --> 02:26:04,620
because of a current gap between the
 

7365
02:26:04,620 --> 02:26:05,809
because of a current gap between the
sophisticated

7366
02:26:05,809 --> 02:26:05,819
sophisticated
 

7367
02:26:05,819 --> 02:26:09,410
sophisticated
theories which came from applying

7368
02:26:09,410 --> 02:26:09,420
theories which came from applying
 

7369
02:26:09,420 --> 02:26:11,990
theories which came from applying
sophisticated mathematics and the actual

universe

7372
02:26:13,190 --> 02:26:13,200
universe
 

7373
02:26:13,200 --> 02:26:15,469
universe
so we have theories first which describe

7374
02:26:15,469 --> 02:26:15,479
so we have theories first which describe
 

7375
02:26:15,479 --> 02:26:17,990
so we have theories first which describe
10-dimensional worlds 10 dimensional

10-dimensional worlds 10 dimensional
 

7377

things like that

7380
02:26:22,429 --> 02:26:22,439
things like that
 

7381
02:26:22,439 --> 02:26:24,710
things like that
but we don't know yet how to

7382
02:26:24,710 --> 02:26:24,720
but we don't know yet how to
 

7383
02:26:24,720 --> 02:26:29,210
but we don't know yet how to
apply it to understanding our universe

7384
02:26:29,210 --> 02:26:29,220
apply it to understanding our universe
 

7385
02:26:29,220 --> 02:26:31,130
apply it to understanding our universe
a lot of progress has been made but it's

7386
02:26:31,130 --> 02:26:31,140
a lot of progress has been made but it's
 

7387
02:26:31,140 --> 02:26:34,130
a lot of progress has been made but it's
kind of a a kind of impasse right now

these two theories are in contradiction
at the moment and string theory was one

02:27:10,670 --> 02:27:10,680
at the moment and string theory was one
 

7419
02:27:10,680 --> 02:27:12,889
at the moment and string theory was one
of the the promise of string theory was

of the the promise of string theory was
 

7421
02:27:12,899 --> 02:27:15,590
of the the promise of string theory was
that it would unify those two and so far

that it would unify those two and so far
 

7423
02:27:15,600 --> 02:27:18,230
that it would unify those two and so far
it has not has not happened so we are

7424
02:27:18,230 --> 02:27:18,240
it has not has not happened so we are
 

7425
02:27:18,240 --> 02:27:19,429
it has not has not happened so we are
kind of at a very interesting place

7426
02:27:19,429 --> 02:27:19,439
kind of at a very interesting place
 

7427
02:27:19,439 --> 02:27:23,630
kind of at a very interesting place
right now and I think that new ideas

7428
02:27:23,630 --> 02:27:23,640
right now and I think that new ideas
 

7429
02:27:23,640 --> 02:27:26,210
right now and I think that new ideas
perhaps are needed and I I wouldn't be

7430
02:27:26,210 --> 02:27:26,220
perhaps are needed and I I wouldn't be
 

7431
02:27:26,220 --> 02:27:28,070
perhaps are needed and I I wouldn't be
surprised if Wheaton is one of those

7432
02:27:28,070 --> 02:27:28,080
surprised if Wheaton is one of those
 

7433
02:27:28,080 --> 02:27:30,170
surprised if Wheaton is one of those
people who come up with those ideas well

7434
02:27:30,170 --> 02:27:30,180
people who come up with those ideas well
 

7435
02:27:30,180 --> 02:27:32,510
people who come up with those ideas well
he has been one of the

he has been one of the
 

7437
02:27:32,520 --> 02:27:34,610
he has been one of the
one of the people that added a lot of

7438
02:27:34,610 --> 02:27:34,620
one of the people that added a lot of
 

7439
02:27:34,620 --> 02:27:37,550
one of the people that added a lot of
ideas under the flag of string theory

7440
02:27:37,550 --> 02:27:37,560
ideas under the flag of string theory
 

7441
02:27:37,560 --> 02:27:39,770
ideas under the flag of string theory
uh what do you think about this Theory

7442
02:27:39,770 --> 02:27:39,780
uh what do you think about this Theory
 

7443
02:27:39,780 --> 02:27:41,990
uh what do you think about this Theory
what do you think is beautiful about it

7444
02:27:41,990 --> 02:27:42,000
what do you think is beautiful about it

what do you think is beautiful about it
string theory

7446

string theory
 

7447
02:27:44,460 --> 02:27:46,969
string theory
well first of all kind of

7448
02:27:46,969 --> 02:27:46,979
well first of all kind of
 

7449
02:27:46,979 --> 02:27:48,050
well first of all kind of
um you remember we talked about

7450
02:27:48,050 --> 02:27:48,060
um you remember we talked about
 

7451
02:27:48,060 --> 02:27:52,309
um you remember we talked about
pythagoreans and how for pythagoreans

7452
02:27:52,309 --> 02:27:52,319
pythagoreans and how for pythagoreans
 

7453
02:27:52,319 --> 02:27:54,830
pythagoreans and how for pythagoreans
the whole world was the symphony where

7454
02:27:54,830 --> 02:27:54,840
the whole world was the symphony where
 

7455
02:27:54,840 --> 02:27:56,450
the whole world was the symphony where
you have this different vibrations of

7456
02:27:56,450 --> 02:27:56,460
you have this different vibrations of
 

7457
02:27:56,460 --> 02:27:58,969
you have this different vibrations of
all the humans every human is a

7458
02:27:58,969 --> 02:27:58,979
all the humans every human is a
 

7459
02:27:58,979 --> 02:28:01,190
all the humans every human is a
vibration every every animal you know

7460
02:28:01,190 --> 02:28:01,200
vibration every every animal you know
 

7461
02:28:01,200 --> 02:28:03,290
vibration every every animal you know
every being every tree and every

7462
02:28:03,290 --> 02:28:03,300
every being every tree and every

every being every tree and every
Celestial body and so on

7464
02:28:05,270 --> 02:28:05,280
Celestial body and so on
 

7465
02:28:05,280 --> 02:28:06,889
Celestial body and so on
so strings that is kind of like that

7466
02:28:06,889 --> 02:28:06,899
so strings that is kind of like that
 

7467
02:28:06,899 --> 02:28:08,690
so strings that is kind of like that
because in string theory there is this

7468
02:28:08,690 --> 02:28:08,700
because in string theory there is this
 

7469
02:28:08,700 --> 02:28:10,250
because in string theory there is this
fundamental object which is a vibrating

7470
02:28:10,250 --> 02:28:10,260
fundamental object which is a vibrating
 

7471
02:28:10,260 --> 02:28:11,830
fundamental object which is a vibrating
string

and all particles are in a sense
supposed to be different modulations or

02:28:17,090 --> 02:28:17,100
supposed to be different modulations or
 

7477
02:28:17,100 --> 02:28:19,370
supposed to be different modulations or
vibrations of that string so that by

7478
02:28:19,370 --> 02:28:19,380
vibrations of that string so that by
 

7479
02:28:19,380 --> 02:28:21,290
vibrations of that string so that by
itself is already interesting that you

7480
02:28:21,290 --> 02:28:21,300
itself is already interesting that you
 

7481
02:28:21,300 --> 02:28:22,969
itself is already interesting that you
kind of

7482
02:28:22,969 --> 02:28:22,979
kind of
 

7483
02:28:22,979 --> 02:28:25,969
kind of
describe this diversity of various

7484
02:28:25,969 --> 02:28:25,979
describe this diversity of various
 

7485
02:28:25,979 --> 02:28:27,710
describe this diversity of various
particles and interactions between them

7486
02:28:27,710 --> 02:28:27,720
particles and interactions between them
 

7487
02:28:27,720 --> 02:28:30,349

sense
 

7491
02:28:31,319 --> 02:28:33,110
sense
but also just the mathematical things

7492
02:28:33,110 --> 02:28:33,120
but also just the mathematical things
 

7493
02:28:33,120 --> 02:28:35,870
but also just the mathematical things
that come out of it the uh the kind of

7494
02:28:35,870 --> 02:28:35,880
that come out of it the uh the kind of
 

7495
02:28:35,880 --> 02:28:38,450
that come out of it the uh the kind of
um it looks impossible to satisfy

7496
02:28:38,450 --> 02:28:38,460
um it looks impossible to satisfy
 

7497
02:28:38,460 --> 02:28:40,550
um it looks impossible to satisfy
various constraints and then that is

7498
02:28:40,550 --> 02:28:40,560
various constraints and then that is
 

7499
02:28:40,560 --> 02:28:42,710
various constraints and then that is
sort of like a unique way to do it so

7500
02:28:42,710 --> 02:28:42,720
sort of like a unique way to do it so
 

7501
02:28:42,720 --> 02:28:44,570
sort of like a unique way to do it so
that's sort of the

7502
02:28:44,570 --> 02:28:44,580
that's sort of the
 

7503
02:28:44,580 --> 02:28:46,610
that's sort of the
every time that happens when you know

7504
02:28:46,610 --> 02:28:46,620
every time that happens when you know
 

7505
02:28:46,620 --> 02:28:48,770
every time that happens when you know
you have some system over like over

7506
02:28:48,770 --> 02:28:48,780
you have some system over like over
 

7507
02:28:48,780 --> 02:28:51,710
you have some system over like over
determined system let's suppose

7508
02:28:51,710 --> 02:28:51,720
determined system let's suppose
 

7509
02:28:51,720 --> 02:28:54,170
determined system let's suppose
you have to do like five interviews in

7510
02:28:54,170 --> 02:28:54,180
you have to do like five interviews in
 

7511
02:28:54,180 --> 02:28:56,929
you have to do like five interviews in
one day yeah and you wake up in the

7512
02:28:56,929 --> 02:28:56,939
one day yeah and you wake up in the
 

7513
02:28:56,939 --> 02:28:58,429
one day yeah and you wake up in the
morning and you're like that's

7514
02:28:58,429 --> 02:28:58,439
morning and you're like that's
 

7515
02:28:58,439 --> 02:28:59,809
morning and you're like that's
impossible

7516
02:28:59,809 --> 02:28:59,819
impossible
 

7517
02:28:59,819 --> 02:29:01,429
impossible
because then so many things have to

7518
02:29:01,429 --> 02:29:01,439
because then so many things have to
 

7519
02:29:01,439 --> 02:29:03,290
because then so many things have to
align for instance let's suppose you

7520
02:29:03,290 --> 02:29:03,300
align for instance let's suppose you
 

7521
02:29:03,300 --> 02:29:04,969
align for instance let's suppose you
have to go from one place to another so

7522
02:29:04,969 --> 02:29:04,979
have to go from one place to another so
 

7523
02:29:04,979 --> 02:29:06,410
have to go from one place to another so
then you have a commute and then who

7524
02:29:06,410 --> 02:29:06,420
then you have a commute and then who
 

7525
02:29:06,420 --> 02:29:08,389
then you have a commute and then who
knows maybe there is a traffic jam and

7526
02:29:08,389 --> 02:29:08,399
knows maybe there is a traffic jam and
 

7527
02:29:08,399 --> 02:29:10,429
knows maybe there is a traffic jam and
stuff like that and now suppose that it

7528
02:29:10,429 --> 02:29:10,439
stuff like that and now suppose that it
 

7529
02:29:10,439 --> 02:29:13,429
stuff like that and now suppose that it
all works seamlessly and there were like

7530
02:29:13,429 --> 02:29:13,439
all works seamlessly and there were like
 

7531
02:29:13,439 --> 02:29:15,110
all works seamlessly and there were like
a bunch of places where it could have

7532
02:29:15,110 --> 02:29:15,120
a bunch of places where it could have
 

7533
02:29:15,120 --> 02:29:18,889
a bunch of places where it could have
gone hopelessly wrong and it didn't and

7534
02:29:18,889 --> 02:29:18,899
gone hopelessly wrong and it didn't and
 

7535
02:29:18,899 --> 02:29:21,410
gone hopelessly wrong and it didn't and
then in the evening you're like wow it

7536
02:29:21,410 --> 02:29:21,420
then in the evening you're like wow it
 

7537
02:29:21,420 --> 02:29:23,990
then in the evening you're like wow it
worked that's beautiful right that's

7538
02:29:23,990 --> 02:29:24,000
worked that's beautiful right that's
 

7539
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:25,790
worked that's beautiful right that's
kind of like

7540
02:29:25,790 --> 02:29:25,800
kind of like
 

7541
02:29:25,800 --> 02:29:28,849
kind of like
great luck you know we would save but

7542
02:29:28,849 --> 02:29:28,859
great luck you know we would save but
 

7543
02:29:28,859 --> 02:29:31,070
great luck you know we would save but
in science this happens sometimes that

7544
02:29:31,070 --> 02:29:31,080
in science this happens sometimes that
 

7545
02:29:31,080 --> 02:29:32,510
in science this happens sometimes that
you have this Theory which not supposed

7546
02:29:32,510 --> 02:29:32,520
you have this Theory which not supposed
 

7547
02:29:32,520 --> 02:29:34,570
you have this Theory which not supposed
to work because there's so many

7548
02:29:34,570 --> 02:29:34,580
to work because there's so many
 

7549
02:29:34,580 --> 02:29:37,010
to work because there's so many
seemingly contradictory demands on it

7550
02:29:37,010 --> 02:29:37,020
seemingly contradictory demands on it
 

7551
02:29:37,020 --> 02:29:40,190
seemingly contradictory demands on it
and yet there is a sweet spot where they

7552
02:29:40,190 --> 02:29:40,200
and yet there is a sweet spot where they
 

7553
02:29:40,200 --> 02:29:41,990
and yet there is a sweet spot where they
balance each other so string theory is

7554
02:29:41,990 --> 02:29:42,000
balance each other so string theory is
 

7555
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:43,550
balance each other so string theory is
kind of like this

7556
02:29:43,550 --> 02:29:43,560
kind of like this
 

7557
02:29:43,560 --> 02:29:46,010
kind of like this
the unfortunate aspect of it is that it

7558
02:29:46,010 --> 02:29:46,020
the unfortunate aspect of it is that it
 

7559
02:29:46,020 --> 02:29:48,469
the unfortunate aspect of it is that it
balances itself in 10 dimensions and not

7560
02:29:48,469 --> 02:29:48,479
balances itself in 10 dimensions and not
 

7561
02:29:48,479 --> 02:29:49,730
balances itself in 10 dimensions and not
in four

7562
02:29:49,730 --> 02:29:49,740
in four
 

7563
02:29:49,740 --> 02:29:51,650
in four
so maybe there is another Universe

7564
02:29:51,650 --> 02:29:51,660
so maybe there is another Universe
 

7565
02:29:51,660 --> 02:29:52,590
so maybe there is another Universe
somewhere

7566
02:29:52,590 --> 02:29:52,600
somewhere
 

7567
02:29:52,600 --> 02:29:55,370
somewhere
[Laughter]

7568
02:29:55,370 --> 02:29:55,380
[Laughter]
 

7569
02:29:55,380 --> 02:29:56,990
[Laughter]
as a mathematician

7570
02:29:56,990 --> 02:29:57,000
as a mathematician
 

7571
02:29:57,000 --> 02:30:00,590
as a mathematician
for me all spaces are created equal yeah

7572
02:30:00,590 --> 02:30:00,600
for me all spaces are created equal yeah
 

7573
02:30:00,600 --> 02:30:02,570
for me all spaces are created equal yeah
10 dimensional four-dimensional so

7574
02:30:02,570 --> 02:30:02,580
10 dimensional four-dimensional so
 

7575
02:30:02,580 --> 02:30:03,950
10 dimensional four-dimensional so
mathematicians love String Theory

7576
02:30:03,950 --> 02:30:03,960
mathematicians love String Theory
 

7577
02:30:03,960 --> 02:30:06,530
mathematicians love String Theory
because it has given us so much so much

7578
02:30:06,530 --> 02:30:06,540
because it has given us so much so much
 

7579
02:30:06,540 --> 02:30:08,150
because it has given us so much so much
food for thought

7580
02:30:08,150 --> 02:30:08,160
food for thought
 

7581
02:30:08,160 --> 02:30:10,490
food for thought
but do you think

7582
02:30:10,490 --> 02:30:10,500
but do you think
 

7583
02:30:10,500 --> 02:30:13,370
but do you think
it's a correct

7584
02:30:13,370 --> 02:30:13,380
it's a correct
 

7585
02:30:13,380 --> 02:30:16,490
it's a correct
or a incorrect theory for understanding

7586
02:30:16,490 --> 02:30:16,500
or a incorrect theory for understanding
 

7587
02:30:16,500 --> 02:30:17,870
or a incorrect theory for understanding
this reality

7588
02:30:17,870 --> 02:30:17,880
this reality
 

7589
02:30:17,880 --> 02:30:20,450
this reality
so it might be a theory that explains

7590
02:30:20,450 --> 02:30:20,460
so it might be a theory that explains
 

7591
02:30:20,460 --> 02:30:22,190
so it might be a theory that explains
some 10th dimensional reality in some

7592
02:30:22,190 --> 02:30:22,200
some 10th dimensional reality in some
 

7593
02:30:22,200 --> 02:30:25,070
some 10th dimensional reality in some
other universe but is it potentially

7594
02:30:25,070 --> 02:30:25,080
other universe but is it potentially
 

7595
02:30:25,080 --> 02:30:26,570
other universe but is it potentially
what do you think are the odds again

7596
02:30:26,570 --> 02:30:26,580
what do you think are the odds again
 

7597
02:30:26,580 --> 02:30:28,910
what do you think are the odds again
Financial advice if you were to bet

7598
02:30:28,910 --> 02:30:28,920
Financial advice if you were to bet
 

7599
02:30:28,920 --> 02:30:32,330
Financial advice if you were to bet
what do you think are the odds that um

7600
02:30:32,330 --> 02:30:32,340
what do you think are the odds that um
 

7601
02:30:32,340 --> 02:30:34,490
what do you think are the odds that um
it gets us closer to understanding this

7602
02:30:34,490 --> 02:30:34,500
it gets us closer to understanding this
 

7603
02:30:34,500 --> 02:30:35,570
it gets us closer to understanding this
reality

7604
02:30:35,570 --> 02:30:35,580
reality
 

7605
02:30:35,580 --> 02:30:38,630
reality
well in the Forum that it is now that

7606
02:30:38,630 --> 02:30:38,640
well in the Forum that it is now that
 

7607
02:30:38,640 --> 02:30:41,030
well in the Forum that it is now that
seems unlikely but it could well be that

7608
02:30:41,030 --> 02:30:41,040
seems unlikely but it could well be that
 

7609
02:30:41,040 --> 02:30:42,590
seems unlikely but it could well be that
based on these ideas with some

7610
02:30:42,590 --> 02:30:42,600
based on these ideas with some
 

7611
02:30:42,600 --> 02:30:44,450
based on these ideas with some
modifications with some essential new

7612
02:30:44,450 --> 02:30:44,460
modifications with some essential new
 

7613
02:30:44,460 --> 02:30:45,650
modifications with some essential new
elements

7614
02:30:45,650 --> 02:30:45,660
elements
 

7615
02:30:45,660 --> 02:30:48,530
elements
it could it could work out so I would

7616
02:30:48,530 --> 02:30:48,540
it could it could work out so I would
 

7617
02:30:48,540 --> 02:30:49,849
it could it could work out so I would
say right now it doesn't look so good

7618
02:30:49,849 --> 02:30:49,859
say right now it doesn't look so good
 

7619
02:30:49,859 --> 02:30:52,190
say right now it doesn't look so good
like from the point of view that we of

7620
02:30:52,190 --> 02:30:52,200
like from the point of view that we of
 

7621
02:30:52,200 --> 02:30:54,950
like from the point of view that we of
what we from what we know

7622
02:30:54,950 --> 02:30:54,960
what we from what we know
 

7623
02:30:54,960 --> 02:30:57,110
what we from what we know
but maybe somebody will come in into a

7624
02:30:57,110 --> 02:30:57,120
but maybe somebody will come in into a
 

7625
02:30:57,120 --> 02:30:59,809
but maybe somebody will come in into a
juice like square root of negative one I

7626
02:30:59,809 --> 02:30:59,819
juice like square root of negative one I
 

7627
02:30:59,819 --> 02:31:01,130
juice like square root of negative one I
mean they already introduced but I mean

7628
02:31:01,130 --> 02:31:01,140
mean they already introduced but I mean
 

7629
02:31:01,140 --> 02:31:03,110
mean they already introduced but I mean
kind of like as a metaphor yeah maybe

7630
02:31:03,110 --> 02:31:03,120
kind of like as a metaphor yeah maybe
 

7631
02:31:03,120 --> 02:31:05,870
kind of like as a metaphor yeah maybe
somebody will come and say what if we do

7632
02:31:05,870 --> 02:31:05,880
somebody will come and say what if we do
 

7633
02:31:05,880 --> 02:31:08,809
somebody will come and say what if we do
this it looks crazy you know speaking of

02:31:08,809 --> 02:31:08,819
this it looks crazy you know speaking of
 

7635
02:31:08,819 --> 02:31:10,190
this it looks crazy you know speaking of

there is no doubt that your theory is

02:31:15,889 --> 02:31:15,899
there is no doubt that your theory is
 

7643
02:31:15,899 --> 02:31:18,770
there is no doubt that your theory is
crazy the question is whether it's crazy

7644
02:31:18,770 --> 02:31:18,780
crazy the question is whether it's crazy
 

7645
02:31:18,780 --> 02:31:22,010
crazy the question is whether it's crazy
enough to describe reality so that's

7646
02:31:22,010 --> 02:31:22,020
enough to describe reality so that's
 

7647
02:31:22,020 --> 02:31:24,050
enough to describe reality so that's

02:31:24,060 --> 02:31:27,830

02:31:27,830 --> 02:31:27,840
of crazy and crazy enough uh let me ask
 

7651
02:31:27,840 --> 02:31:30,469
of crazy and crazy enough uh let me ask
for um

02:31:54,960 --> 02:31:59,450
if you were to describe this Theory to

7671
02:31:59,460 --> 02:32:01,730

how would you do it or you could try if

02:32:01,730 --> 02:32:01,740
how would you do it or you could try if
 

7673
02:32:01,740 --> 02:32:03,050
how would you do it or you could try if
it was just me

7674
02:32:03,050 --> 02:32:03,060
it was just me
 

7675
02:32:03,060 --> 02:32:06,110
it was just me
visiting Earth uh how would you describe

7676
02:32:06,110 --> 02:32:06,120
visiting Earth uh how would you describe
 

7677
02:32:06,120 --> 02:32:08,210
visiting Earth uh how would you describe
your best understanding of it

7678
02:32:08,210 --> 02:32:08,220
your best understanding of it
 

7679
02:32:08,220 --> 02:32:11,389
your best understanding of it
he shared with me some of it when I was

7680
02:32:11,389 --> 02:32:11,399
he shared with me some of it when I was
 

7681
02:32:11,399 --> 02:32:13,309
he shared with me some of it when I was
in New York at Colombia like 11 years

7682
02:32:13,309 --> 02:32:13,319
in New York at Colombia like 11 years

in New York at Colombia like 11 years
ago we actually spent a lot of time

02:32:14,990 --> 02:32:15,000
ago we actually spent a lot of time
 

7685
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,030
ago we actually spent a lot of time
where he explained to me and I found it

7686
02:32:17,030 --> 02:32:17,040
where he explained to me and I found it
 

7687
02:32:17,040 --> 02:32:18,110
where he explained to me and I found it
beautiful

goes to the point I made earlier that we
 

7703
02:32:36,120 --> 02:32:37,730
goes to the point I made earlier that we
need new ideas

new idea we won't be able to get closer
to understanding our universe now I have

02:32:46,849 --> 02:32:46,859
to understanding our universe now I have
 

7711
02:32:46,859 --> 02:32:48,530
to understanding our universe now I have
a problem with the whole idea of Theory

kind of that it's not really because

that's how it is in mathematics I I feel

7772
02:33:56,110 --> 02:33:56,120
that's how it is in mathematics I I feel
 

7773
02:33:56,120 --> 02:34:00,290
that's how it is in mathematics I I feel
and I would venture to say that most

7774
02:34:00,290 --> 02:34:00,300
and I would venture to say that most
 

7775
02:34:00,300 --> 02:34:01,910
and I would venture to say that most
mathematicians look at it this way like

7776
02:34:01,910 --> 02:34:01,920
mathematicians look at it this way like
 

7777
02:34:01,920 --> 02:34:03,590
mathematicians look at it this way like
there's no idea that somehow I think

7778
02:34:03,590 --> 02:34:03,600
there's no idea that somehow I think
 

7779
02:34:03,600 --> 02:34:05,270
there's no idea that somehow I think
it's actually impossible because we're

7780
02:34:05,270 --> 02:34:05,280
it's actually impossible because we're
 

7781
02:34:05,280 --> 02:34:06,950
it's actually impossible because we're
not talking about such a thing as like

7782
02:34:06,950 --> 02:34:06,960
not talking about such a thing as like
 

7783
02:34:06,960 --> 02:34:08,450
not talking about such a thing as like
one Universe we're talking about all

7784
02:34:08,450 --> 02:34:08,460
one Universe we're talking about all
 

7785
02:34:08,460 --> 02:34:09,950
one Universe we're talking about all
possible universes of all possible

7786
02:34:09,950 --> 02:34:09,960
possible universes of all possible
 

7787
02:34:09,960 --> 02:34:11,929
possible universes of all possible
dimensions and so on it is just not

7788
02:34:11,929 --> 02:34:11,939
dimensions and so on it is just not
 

7789
02:34:11,939 --> 02:34:14,389
dimensions and so on it is just not
feasible to have a unified unify

7790
02:34:14,389 --> 02:34:14,399
feasible to have a unified unify
 

7791
02:34:14,399 --> 02:34:17,150

everything in one equation

now physicists on the other hand have

7794
02:34:19,670 --> 02:34:19,680
now physicists on the other hand have
 

7795
02:34:19,680 --> 02:34:22,130
now physicists on the other hand have
been brought up educated for decades

7796
02:34:22,130 --> 02:34:22,140
been brought up educated for decades
 

7797
02:34:22,140 --> 02:34:25,550
been brought up educated for decades
with this idea and to me and I I'm not

7798
02:34:25,550 --> 02:34:25,560
with this idea and to me and I I'm not
 

7799
02:34:25,560 --> 02:34:26,870
with this idea and to me and I I'm not
sure I should say that but I feel like

7800
02:34:26,870 --> 02:34:26,880
sure I should say that but I feel like
 

7801
02:34:26,880 --> 02:34:29,450
sure I should say that but I feel like
it's a kind of an ultimate ego trip

7802
02:34:29,450 --> 02:34:29,460
it's a kind of an ultimate ego trip
 

7803
02:34:29,460 --> 02:34:32,150
it's a kind of an ultimate ego trip
so that I have come up with the unified

7804
02:34:32,150 --> 02:34:32,160
so that I have come up with the unified
 

7805
02:34:32,160 --> 02:34:34,010
so that I have come up with the unified
I have found the intensity of everything

7806
02:34:34,010 --> 02:34:34,020
I have found the intensity of everything
 

7807
02:34:34,020 --> 02:34:36,830
I have found the intensity of everything
it's me and my name will be on it I

7808
02:34:36,830 --> 02:34:36,840
it's me and my name will be on it I
 

7809
02:34:36,840 --> 02:34:40,309
it's me and my name will be on it I
think a lot of physicists get educated

7810
02:34:40,309 --> 02:34:40,319
think a lot of physicists get educated
 

7811
02:34:40,319 --> 02:34:41,750
think a lot of physicists get educated
this way especially men take it

7812
02:34:41,750 --> 02:34:41,760
this way especially men take it
 

7813
02:34:41,760 --> 02:34:44,090
this way especially men take it
seriously yeah and I've seen that happen

7814
02:34:44,090 --> 02:34:44,100
seriously yeah and I've seen that happen
 

7815
02:34:44,100 --> 02:34:46,429
seriously yeah and I've seen that happen
and I think it is counterproductive I

7816
02:34:46,429 --> 02:34:46,439
and I think it is counterproductive I
 

7817
02:34:46,439 --> 02:34:48,410
and I think it is counterproductive I
think that a lot of people agree that

7818
02:34:48,410 --> 02:34:48,420
think that a lot of people agree that
 

7819
02:34:48,420 --> 02:34:50,630
think that a lot of people agree that
this debate is kind of I feel like it's

7820
02:34:50,630 --> 02:34:50,640
this debate is kind of I feel like it's
 

7821
02:34:50,640 --> 02:34:52,730
this debate is kind of I feel like it's
kind of settled I think I hear it less

7822
02:34:52,730 --> 02:34:52,740
kind of settled I think I hear it less
 

7823
02:34:52,740 --> 02:34:53,570
kind of settled I think I hear it less
and less

7824
02:34:53,570 --> 02:34:53,580
and less
 

7825
02:34:53,580 --> 02:34:54,889
and less
but

7826
02:34:54,889 --> 02:34:54,899
but
 

7827
02:34:54,899 --> 02:34:57,950
but
I disagree with the whole premise so you

7828
02:34:57,950 --> 02:34:57,960
I disagree with the whole premise so you
 

7829
02:34:57,960 --> 02:35:00,889
I disagree with the whole premise so you
uh it's interesting because because both

7830
02:35:00,889 --> 02:35:00,899
uh it's interesting because because both
 

7831
02:35:00,899 --> 02:35:03,050
uh it's interesting because because both
are interesting points you made which is

7832
02:35:03,050 --> 02:35:03,060
are interesting points you made which is
 

7833
02:35:03,060 --> 02:35:04,490
are interesting points you made which is
you don't think a Theory of Everything

7834
02:35:04,490 --> 02:35:04,500
you don't think a Theory of Everything
 

7835
02:35:04,500 --> 02:35:06,469
you don't think a Theory of Everything
exists and

7836
02:35:06,469 --> 02:35:06,479
exists and
 

7837
02:35:06,479 --> 02:35:08,990
exists and
you don't think the pursuit of a theory

7838
02:35:08,990 --> 02:35:09,000
you don't think the pursuit of a theory
 

7839
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:10,490
you don't think the pursuit of a theory
of everything is good so I think you

7840
02:35:10,490 --> 02:35:10,500
of everything is good so I think you
 

7841
02:35:10,500 --> 02:35:12,770
of everything is good so I think you
spoke to the second thing which is

7842
02:35:12,770 --> 02:35:12,780
spoke to the second thing which is
 

7843
02:35:12,780 --> 02:35:15,950
spoke to the second thing which is
basically uh that the pursuit of a

7844
02:35:15,950 --> 02:35:15,960
basically uh that the pursuit of a
 

7845
02:35:15,960 --> 02:35:18,050
basically uh that the pursuit of a
theory of everything becomes like a drug

7846
02:35:18,050 --> 02:35:18,060
theory of everything becomes like a drug
 

7847
02:35:18,060 --> 02:35:20,570
theory of everything becomes like a drug
to the human ego that's right so it is a

7848
02:35:20,570 --> 02:35:20,580
to the human ego that's right so it is a
 

7849
02:35:20,580 --> 02:35:22,730
to the human ego that's right so it is a
huge motivating factor I don't deny that

7850
02:35:22,730 --> 02:35:22,740
huge motivating factor I don't deny that
 

7851
02:35:22,740 --> 02:35:25,490
huge motivating factor I don't deny that
but I feel that it's there are better

7852
02:35:25,490 --> 02:35:25,500
but I feel that it's there are better
 

7853
02:35:25,500 --> 02:35:29,330
but I feel that it's there are better
ways to motivate people than like that

7854
02:35:29,330 --> 02:35:29,340
ways to motivate people than like that
 

7855
02:35:29,340 --> 02:35:32,570
ways to motivate people than like that
then this way okay so

7856
02:35:32,570 --> 02:35:32,580
then this way okay so
 

7857
02:35:32,580 --> 02:35:34,730
then this way okay so
um I would say for instance if one

7858
02:35:34,730 --> 02:35:34,740
um I would say for instance if one
 

7859
02:35:34,740 --> 02:35:37,550
um I would say for instance if one
because then it's not a game of Winner

7860
02:35:37,550 --> 02:35:37,560
because then it's not a game of Winner
 

7861
02:35:37,560 --> 02:35:39,349
because then it's not a game of Winner
Takes to all in some sense

02:35:46,010 --> 02:35:46,020
theory they mean something very specific
 

7869
02:35:46,020 --> 02:35:47,809
theory they mean something very specific
which is unifying the standard model and

7870
02:35:47,809 --> 02:35:47,819
which is unifying the standard model and
 

7871
02:35:47,819 --> 02:35:50,090
which is unifying the standard model and
Einstein's relativity Theory which is a

7872
02:35:50,090 --> 02:35:50,100
Einstein's relativity Theory which is a
 

7873
02:35:50,100 --> 02:35:51,349
Einstein's relativity Theory which is a
theory of gravity

7874

so they don't necessarily a cloud of

so they don't necessarily a cloud of

so they don't necessarily a cloud of
physics may say this worse but they

02:35:55,490 --> 02:35:55,500
physics may say this worse but they
 

7879
02:35:55,500 --> 02:35:57,469
physics may say this worse but they
don't really mean them

7880
02:35:57,469 --> 02:35:57,479
don't really mean them
 

7881
02:35:57,479 --> 02:35:59,330
don't really mean them
I think it's important to realize that

7882
02:35:59,330 --> 02:35:59,340
I think it's important to realize that
 

7883
02:35:59,340 --> 02:36:01,790
I think it's important to realize that
that in my opinion that's not productive

7884
02:36:01,790 --> 02:36:01,800
that in my opinion that's not productive
 

7885
02:36:01,800 --> 02:36:04,309
that in my opinion that's not productive
and it's not visible anyway so having

and it's not visible anyway so having
 

7887
02:36:04,319 --> 02:36:06,050
and it's not visible anyway so having
said that there are some theories are

7888
02:36:06,050 --> 02:36:06,060
said that there are some theories are
 

7889
02:36:06,060 --> 02:36:07,490
said that there are some theories are
better than others obviously so for

02:36:07,490 --> 02:36:07,500
better than others obviously so for

02:36:14,690 --> 02:36:14,700
producing some of the elementary
 

7897
02:36:14,700 --> 02:36:17,389
producing some of the elementary
particles that we see and as well as the

7899
02:36:17,399 --> 02:36:19,490
particles that we see and as well as the
force of gravity so it does have that

7900
02:36:19,490 --> 02:36:19,500
force of gravity so it does have that
 

7901
02:36:19,500 --> 02:36:20,570

7987
02:38:02,399 --> 02:38:05,270
rigorous issue what I mean because the
whole framework is not yet on a firm

7988
02:38:05,270 --> 02:38:05,280
whole framework is not yet on a firm
 

7989
02:38:05,280 --> 02:38:06,469
whole framework is not yet on a firm
foundation

7990
02:38:06,469 --> 02:38:06,479
foundation
 

7991
02:38:06,479 --> 02:38:09,590
foundation
so it's not consistent right why is it

7992
02:38:09,590 --> 02:38:09,600
so it's not consistent right why is it
 

7993
02:38:09,600 --> 02:38:11,450
so it's not consistent right why is it
that the Universe should have

7994
02:38:11,450 --> 02:38:11,460
that the Universe should have
 

7995
02:38:11,460 --> 02:38:13,610
that the Universe should have
so that's to your first point do you

7996
02:38:13,610 --> 02:38:13,620
so that's to your first point do you
 

7997
02:38:13,620 --> 02:38:17,510
so that's to your first point do you
think the universe has a beautiful clean

7998
02:38:17,510 --> 02:38:17,520
think the universe has a beautiful clean
 

7999
02:38:17,520 --> 02:38:19,429
think the universe has a beautiful clean
when you show up and meet God and

8000
02:38:19,429 --> 02:38:19,439
when you show up and meet God and
 

8001
02:38:19,439 --> 02:38:22,070
when you show up and meet God and
there's one equation on the board and

8002
02:38:22,070 --> 02:38:22,080
there's one equation on the board and
 

8003
02:38:22,080 --> 02:38:24,349
there's one equation on the board and
the two of you just chuckle the things

8004
02:38:24,349 --> 02:38:24,359
the two of you just chuckle the things
 

8005
02:38:24,359 --> 02:38:26,570
the two of you just chuckle the things
that the equation exists

8006
02:38:26,570 --> 02:38:26,580
that the equation exists
 

8007
02:38:26,580 --> 02:38:28,670
that the equation exists
yeah there are such equations for

8008
02:38:28,670 --> 02:38:28,680
yeah there are such equations for
 

8009
02:38:28,680 --> 02:38:29,809
yeah there are such equations for
instance

8010
02:38:29,809 --> 02:38:29,819
instance
 

8011
02:38:29,819 --> 02:38:32,030
instance
let's say I am

8012
02:38:32,030 --> 02:38:32,040
let's say I am
 

8013
02:38:32,040 --> 02:38:34,190
let's say I am
interested in particular question right

8014
02:38:34,190 --> 02:38:34,200
interested in particular question right
 

8015
02:38:34,200 --> 02:38:35,450
interested in particular question right
so

8016
02:38:35,450 --> 02:38:35,460
so
 

8017
02:38:35,460 --> 02:38:38,150
so
in the language program say so moving

8018
02:38:38,150 --> 02:38:38,160
in the language program say so moving
 

8019
02:38:38,160 --> 02:38:39,469
in the language program say so moving
away from physics so let's talk about

8020
02:38:39,469 --> 02:38:39,479
away from physics so let's talk about
 

8021
02:38:39,479 --> 02:38:40,910
away from physics so let's talk about
math so

8022
02:38:40,910 --> 02:38:40,920
math so
 

8023
02:38:40,920 --> 02:38:43,910
math so
in in the context of language program

8024
02:38:43,910 --> 02:38:43,920
in in the context of language program
 

8025
02:38:43,920 --> 02:38:45,889
in in the context of language program
I have recently developed with my

8026
02:38:45,889 --> 02:38:45,899
I have recently developed with my
 

8027
02:38:45,899 --> 02:38:48,290
I have recently developed with my
co-authors I think of in cash then and

8028
02:38:48,290 --> 02:38:48,300
co-authors I think of in cash then and
 

8029
02:38:48,300 --> 02:38:50,630
co-authors I think of in cash then and
kind of a new strand a new flavor of the

8030
02:38:50,630 --> 02:38:50,640
kind of a new strand a new flavor of the
 

8031
02:38:50,640 --> 02:38:52,969
kind of a new strand a new flavor of the
language program if you will

8032
02:38:52,969 --> 02:38:52,979
language program if you will
 

8033
02:38:52,979 --> 02:38:55,070
language program if you will
but so far it's a sort of it's a vision

8034
02:38:55,070 --> 02:38:55,080
but so far it's a sort of it's a vision
 

8035
02:38:55,080 --> 02:38:57,530
but so far it's a sort of it's a vision
it's a set of conjectures

8036
02:38:57,530 --> 02:38:57,540
it's a set of conjectures
 

8037
02:38:57,540 --> 02:38:59,450
it's a set of conjectures
which we have proved in some cases but

8038
02:38:59,450 --> 02:38:59,460
which we have proved in some cases but
 

8039
02:38:59,460 --> 02:39:01,250
which we have proved in some cases but
not in full generality

8040
02:39:01,250 --> 02:39:01,260
not in full generality
 

8041
02:39:01,260 --> 02:39:04,370
not in full generality
so yes I would like to to use your

8042
02:39:04,370 --> 02:39:04,380
so yes I would like to to use your
 

8043
02:39:04,380 --> 02:39:07,790
so yes I would like to to use your
framework for meet the Creator and ask

8044
02:39:07,790 --> 02:39:07,800
framework for meet the Creator and ask
 

8045
02:39:07,800 --> 02:39:10,849
framework for meet the Creator and ask
her

8046
02:39:10,849 --> 02:39:10,859

 

8047
02:39:10,859 --> 02:39:13,670

what is the explanation of this and it

8048
02:39:13,670 --> 02:39:13,680
what is the explanation of this and it
 

8049
02:39:13,680 --> 02:39:15,349
what is the explanation of this and it
may well be that you will answer in a

8050
02:39:15,349 --> 02:39:15,359
may well be that you will answer in a
 

8051
02:39:15,359 --> 02:39:17,090
may well be that you will answer in a
way that I will just burst out laughing

8052
02:39:17,090 --> 02:39:17,100
way that I will just burst out laughing
 

8053
02:39:17,100 --> 02:39:19,070
way that I will just burst out laughing
it's like how could we not see it you

8054
02:39:19,070 --> 02:39:19,080
it's like how could we not see it you
 

8055
02:39:19,080 --> 02:39:21,170
it's like how could we not see it you
see so that I totally see

8056
02:39:21,170 --> 02:39:21,180
see so that I totally see
 

8057
02:39:21,180 --> 02:39:24,710
see so that I totally see
but I don't see one equation governing

8058
02:39:24,710 --> 02:39:24,720
but I don't see one equation governing
 

8059
02:39:24,720 --> 02:39:27,710
but I don't see one equation governing
one one equation governing them all

8060
02:39:27,710 --> 02:39:27,720
one one equation governing them all
 

8061
02:39:27,720 --> 02:39:30,050
one one equation governing them all
not one equation to govern them all but

8062
02:39:30,050 --> 02:39:30,060
not one equation to govern them all but
 

8063
02:39:30,060 --> 02:39:32,450
not one equation to govern them all but
it does seem that such equations exist

8064
02:39:32,450 --> 02:39:32,460
it does seem that such equations exist
 

8065
02:39:32,460 --> 02:39:34,730
it does seem that such equations exist
what she will tell you something and you

8066
02:39:34,730 --> 02:39:34,740
what she will tell you something and you
 

8067
02:39:34,740 --> 02:39:37,010
what she will tell you something and you
look back and say how could I not see it

8068
02:39:37,010 --> 02:39:37,020
look back and say how could I not see it
 

8069
02:39:37,020 --> 02:39:39,469
look back and say how could I not see it
it seems like the the truth at the end

8070
02:39:39,469 --> 02:39:39,479
it seems like the the truth at the end
 

8071
02:39:39,479 --> 02:39:41,929
it seems like the the truth at the end
of the day is simple

8072
02:39:41,929 --> 02:39:41,939
of the day is simple
 

8073
02:39:41,939 --> 02:39:44,270
of the day is simple
that we're seeking especially through

8074
02:39:44,270 --> 02:39:44,280
that we're seeking especially through
 

8075
02:39:44,280 --> 02:39:47,090
that we're seeking especially through
mathematics it seems somehow simple

8076
02:39:47,090 --> 02:39:47,100
mathematics it seems somehow simple
 

8077
02:39:47,100 --> 02:39:49,370
mathematics it seems somehow simple
the the the nature reality the thing

8078
02:39:49,370 --> 02:39:49,380
the the the nature reality the thing
 

8079
02:39:49,380 --> 02:39:51,530
the the the nature reality the thing
that governs it seems to be simple I

8080
02:39:51,530 --> 02:39:51,540
that governs it seems to be simple I
 

8081
02:39:51,540 --> 02:39:53,210
that governs it seems to be simple I
wonder why that is

8082
02:39:53,210 --> 02:39:53,220
wonder why that is
 

8083
02:39:53,220 --> 02:39:55,190
wonder why that is
and I also wonder if it's not totally

8084
02:39:55,190 --> 02:39:55,200
and I also wonder if it's not totally
 

8085
02:39:55,200 --> 02:39:58,190
and I also wonder if it's not totally
Incorrect and we're just craving the

02:39:58,190 --> 02:39:58,200
Incorrect and we're just craving the
 

8087
02:39:58,200 --> 02:39:59,929

simplicity
 

8089
02:39:59,939 --> 02:40:01,730
simplicity
and then

8090
02:40:01,730 --> 02:40:01,740
and then
 

8091
02:40:01,740 --> 02:40:04,070
and then
mixing into the whole conversation about

8092
02:40:04,070 --> 02:40:04,080
mixing into the whole conversation about
 

8093
02:40:04,080 --> 02:40:07,010
mixing into the whole conversation about
how much The Observer that creates

8094
02:40:07,010 --> 02:40:07,020
how much The Observer that creates
 

8095
02:40:07,020 --> 02:40:11,090
how much The Observer that creates
Simplicity is part of the answer

8096
02:40:11,090 --> 02:40:11,100
Simplicity is part of the answer
 

8097
02:40:11,100 --> 02:40:13,730
Simplicity is part of the answer
it's a whole big giant mess

so the the limitations of academias

8142
02:41:06,050 --> 02:41:06,060
so the the limitations of academias
 

8143

so the the limitations of academias
there's a community of people that

02:41:10,979 --> 02:41:14,030
take a set of axioms
as gospel so it's harder to take that

8148
02:41:14,030 --> 02:41:14,040
as gospel so it's harder to take that
 

8149
02:41:14,040 --> 02:41:17,330
as gospel so it's harder to take that
leap into the unknown but it's also the

8150
02:41:17,330 --> 02:41:17,340
leap into the unknown but it's also the
 

8151
02:41:17,340 --> 02:41:19,130
leap into the unknown but it's also the
nice thing about Academia is some of the

02:41:19,130 --> 02:41:19,140
nice thing about Academia is some of the

nice thing about Academia is some of the
most brilliant people in the world are

8154

02:41:25,969 --> 02:41:25,979
competition the collaboration is there
 

8159
02:41:25,979 --> 02:41:26,630
competition the collaboration is there
um

8160
02:41:26,630 --> 02:41:26,640
um
 

8161
02:41:26,640 --> 02:41:27,889
um
yeah

yeah
 

8163
02:41:27,899 --> 02:41:29,210
yeah
I wonder if there's something you could

8164
02:41:29,210 --> 02:41:29,220
I wonder if there's something you could
 

8165
02:41:29,220 --> 02:41:30,889
I wonder if there's something you could
say sort of to uh

8166
02:41:30,889 --> 02:41:30,899
say sort of to uh
 

8167
02:41:30,899 --> 02:41:33,469
say sort of to uh
uh further about this world that people

8168
02:41:33,469 --> 02:41:33,479
uh further about this world that people
 

8169
02:41:33,479 --> 02:41:35,570
uh further about this world that people
that might not be familiar with

8170
02:41:35,570 --> 02:41:35,580
that might not be familiar with
 

8171
02:41:35,580 --> 02:41:37,429
that might not be familiar with
but I think you you gave a very good

8172
02:41:37,429 --> 02:41:37,439
but I think you you gave a very good
 

8173
02:41:37,439 --> 02:41:40,130
but I think you you gave a very good
description I'm not sure I could on it

8174
02:41:40,130 --> 02:41:40,140
description I'm not sure I could on it
 

8175
02:41:40,140 --> 02:41:41,750
description I'm not sure I could on it
because I don't have an overarching

8176
02:41:41,750 --> 02:41:41,760
because I don't have an overarching
 

8177
02:41:41,760 --> 02:41:44,750
because I don't have an overarching
theory of academic Academia yes I

8178
02:41:44,750 --> 02:41:44,760
theory of academic Academia yes I
 

8179
02:41:44,760 --> 02:41:46,610
theory of academic Academia yes I
definitely have been part of it and I'm

8180
02:41:46,610 --> 02:41:46,620
definitely have been part of it and I'm

great sense of security
 

8185
02:41:52,500 --> 02:41:55,429
great sense of security
which comes with its own downside too

8186
02:41:55,429 --> 02:41:55,439
which comes with its own downside too
 

8187
02:41:55,439 --> 02:41:56,990
which comes with its own downside too
because you kind of like get a little

8188
02:41:56,990 --> 02:41:57,000
because you kind of like get a little
 

8189
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:58,610
because you kind of like get a little
disconnected from The Real World because

8190
02:41:58,610 --> 02:41:58,620
disconnected from The Real World because
 

8191
02:41:58,620 --> 02:42:01,370
disconnected from The Real World because
you get tenure so you feel financially

8192
02:42:01,370 --> 02:42:01,380
you get tenure so you feel financially
 

8193
02:42:01,380 --> 02:42:03,110
you get tenure so you feel financially
secure you know I didn't pay you that

8194
02:42:03,110 --> 02:42:03,120
secure you know I didn't pay you that
 

8195
02:42:03,120 --> 02:42:04,790
secure you know I didn't pay you that
much so to speak you know relatively

8196
02:42:04,790 --> 02:42:04,800
much so to speak you know relatively
 

8197
02:42:04,800 --> 02:42:07,429
much so to speak you know relatively
speaking and uh it's comfortable but

8198
02:42:07,429 --> 02:42:07,439
speaking and uh it's comfortable but
 

8199
02:42:07,439 --> 02:42:10,490
speaking and uh it's comfortable but
it's not that much but you you can't be

8200
02:42:10,490 --> 02:42:10,500
it's not that much but you you can't be
 

8201
02:42:10,500 --> 02:42:12,849
it's not that much but you you can't be
fired so there is something about this

8202
02:42:12,849 --> 02:42:12,859
fired so there is something about this
 

8203
02:42:12,859 --> 02:42:16,190
fired so there is something about this
which I definitely have benefit from it

8204
02:42:16,190 --> 02:42:16,200
which I definitely have benefit from it
 

8205
02:42:16,200 --> 02:42:18,889
which I definitely have benefit from it
you know and it does

8206
02:42:18,889 --> 02:42:18,899
you know and it does
 

8207
02:42:18,899 --> 02:42:20,929
you know and it does
um people are not even aware what it's

8208
02:42:20,929 --> 02:42:20,939
um people are not even aware what it's
 

8209
02:42:20,939 --> 02:42:23,809
um people are not even aware what it's
like to to live outside where you can

8210
02:42:23,809 --> 02:42:23,819
like to to live outside where you can
 

8211
02:42:23,819 --> 02:42:25,429
like to to live outside where you can
you where you don't have this type of

8212
02:42:25,429 --> 02:42:25,439
you where you don't have this type of
 

8213
02:42:25,439 --> 02:42:28,070
you where you don't have this type of
security on the other hand

8214
02:42:28,070 --> 02:42:28,080
security on the other hand
 

8215
02:42:28,080 --> 02:42:30,410
security on the other hand
that also means that we're lacking

8216
02:42:30,410 --> 02:42:30,420
that also means that we're lacking
 

8217
02:42:30,420 --> 02:42:32,750
that also means that we're lacking
certain skills that sort of real people

8218
02:42:32,750 --> 02:42:32,760
certain skills that sort of real people
 

8219
02:42:32,760 --> 02:42:35,929
certain skills that sort of real people
in the real world have developed out of

8220
02:42:35,929 --> 02:42:35,939
in the real world have developed out of
 

8221
02:42:35,939 --> 02:42:38,690
in the real world have developed out of
necessity to deal with that sort of

8222
02:42:38,690 --> 02:42:38,700
necessity to deal with that sort of
 

8223
02:42:38,700 --> 02:42:41,090
necessity to deal with that sort of
insecurity so it kind of always cuts

8224
02:42:41,090 --> 02:42:41,100
insecurity so it kind of always cuts
 

8225
02:42:41,100 --> 02:42:42,770
insecurity so it kind of always cuts
both ways you know it was one-handed

8226
02:42:42,770 --> 02:42:42,780
both ways you know it was one-handed
 

8227
02:42:42,780 --> 02:42:44,150
both ways you know it was one-handed
gives and with the other hand it takes

8228
02:42:44,150 --> 02:42:44,160
gives and with the other hand it takes
 

8229
02:42:44,160 --> 02:42:47,030
gives and with the other hand it takes
away and it's a very interesting setup

8230
02:42:47,030 --> 02:42:47,040
away and it's a very interesting setup
 

8231
02:42:47,040 --> 02:42:49,190
away and it's a very interesting setup
and also on the one hand we are all

8232
02:42:49,190 --> 02:42:49,200
and also on the one hand we are all
 

8233
02:42:49,200 --> 02:42:51,710
and also on the one hand we are all
supposed to be the truth Seekers and

8234
02:42:51,710 --> 02:42:51,720
supposed to be the truth Seekers and
 

8235
02:42:51,720 --> 02:42:54,770
supposed to be the truth Seekers and
but in reality of course it is a human

8236
02:42:54,770 --> 02:42:54,780
but in reality of course it is a human
 

8237
02:42:54,780 --> 02:42:57,650
but in reality of course it is a human
activity and it is a human community and

8238
02:42:57,650 --> 02:42:57,660
activity and it is a human community and
 

8239
02:42:57,660 --> 02:42:59,990
activity and it is a human community and
with all kinds of good bad and ugly

8240
02:42:59,990 --> 02:43:00,000
with all kinds of good bad and ugly
 

8241
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,090
with all kinds of good bad and ugly
things that happen a lot of them under

8242
02:43:02,090 --> 02:43:02,100
things that happen a lot of them under
 

8243
02:43:02,100 --> 02:43:05,210
things that happen a lot of them under
the radar screen so to speak and so

8244
02:43:05,210 --> 02:43:05,220
the radar screen so to speak and so
 

8245
02:43:05,220 --> 02:43:08,450
the radar screen so to speak and so
but maybe there is something to it there

8246
02:43:08,450 --> 02:43:08,460
but maybe there is something to it there
 

8247
02:43:08,460 --> 02:43:09,889
but maybe there is something to it there
is definitely there are definitely

8248
02:43:09,889 --> 02:43:09,899
is definitely there are definitely
 

8249
02:43:09,899 --> 02:43:13,130
is definitely there are definitely
people who are upholding kind of the old

8250
02:43:13,130 --> 02:43:13,140
people who are upholding kind of the old
 

8251

people who are upholding kind of the old
tradition definitely and that is

8252
02:43:15,410 --> 02:43:15,420
tradition definitely and that is
 

8253
02:43:15,420 --> 02:43:17,750
tradition definitely and that is
inspiring and I aspire to be you know

8254

inspiring and I aspire to be you know
one of those do my best so whether this

8256
02:43:21,290 --> 02:43:21,300
one of those do my best so whether this
 

8257
02:43:21,300 --> 02:43:22,910
one of those do my best so whether this
is

8258
02:43:22,910 --> 02:43:22,920
is
 

8259
02:43:22,920 --> 02:43:25,370
is
um a system that will stay or should

8260
02:43:25,370 --> 02:43:25,380
um a system that will stay or should
 

8261
02:43:25,380 --> 02:43:27,230
um a system that will stay or should
stay I don't know I really don't know

8262
02:43:27,230 --> 02:43:27,240
stay I don't know I really don't know
 

8263
02:43:27,240 --> 02:43:28,969
stay I don't know I really don't know
that's really fast yeah it's it's

8264
02:43:28,969 --> 02:43:28,979
that's really fast yeah it's it's
 

8265
02:43:28,979 --> 02:43:31,190
that's really fast yeah it's it's
fascinating what uh especially with it

8266
02:43:31,190 --> 02:43:31,200
fascinating what uh especially with it
 

8267
02:43:31,200 --> 02:43:34,130
fascinating what uh especially with it
just to introduce the bit of AI poison

8268
02:43:34,130 --> 02:43:34,140
just to introduce the bit of AI poison
 

8269
02:43:34,140 --> 02:43:36,710
just to introduce the bit of AI poison
into the mix as that changes the nature

8270
02:43:36,710 --> 02:43:36,720
into the mix as that changes the nature
 

8271
02:43:36,720 --> 02:43:39,410
into the mix as that changes the nature
of Education perhaps as well uh what the

8272
02:43:39,410 --> 02:43:39,420
of Education perhaps as well uh what the
 

8273
02:43:39,420 --> 02:43:41,510
of Education perhaps as well uh what the
role of the university is in the next 10

8274
02:43:41,510 --> 02:43:41,520
role of the university is in the next 10
 

8275
02:43:41,520 --> 02:43:44,530
role of the university is in the next 10
20 50 100 years I wonder

8276
02:43:44,530 --> 02:43:44,540
20 50 100 years I wonder
 

8277
02:43:44,540 --> 02:43:49,190
20 50 100 years I wonder
uh I wonder and I wonder that you know

8278
02:43:49,190 --> 02:43:49,200
uh I wonder and I wonder that you know
 

8279
02:43:49,200 --> 02:43:50,809
uh I wonder and I wonder that you know
how do you make sense that Einstein was

8280
02:43:50,809 --> 02:43:50,819
how do you make sense that Einstein was
 

8281
02:43:50,819 --> 02:43:53,690
how do you make sense that Einstein was
working after attempting I believe to be

8282
02:43:53,690 --> 02:43:53,700
working after attempting I believe to be
 

8283
02:43:53,700 --> 02:43:57,250
working after attempting I believe to be
a university Professor

um
 

8291
02:44:03,780 --> 02:44:06,230
um
the the science has become so much

8292
02:44:06,230 --> 02:44:06,240
the the science has become so much
 

8293
02:44:06,240 --> 02:44:08,809
the the science has become so much
faster it is really hard to do it being

8294
02:44:08,809 --> 02:44:08,819
faster it is really hard to do it being
 

8295
02:44:08,819 --> 02:44:11,870
faster it is really hard to do it being

I worked every day
 

8425
02:46:48,060 --> 02:46:52,070
I worked every day
and weekends holidays doesn't matter

8426
02:46:52,070 --> 02:46:52,080
and weekends holidays doesn't matter

um
 

8429
02:46:53,040 --> 02:46:55,130

I didn't even question that so I would

02:46:55,130 --> 02:46:55,140
I didn't even question that so I would
 

8431
02:46:55,140 --> 02:46:57,650

took a day off
 

8435

took a day off
and you know

8436
02:47:02,630 --> 02:47:02,640
and you know
 

8437
02:47:02,640 --> 02:47:04,490
and you know
so it was just a kind of a sustained

8438
02:47:04,490 --> 02:47:04,500
so it was just a kind of a sustained
 

8439
02:47:04,500 --> 02:47:07,429
so it was just a kind of a sustained
effort the point is that still the

8440
02:47:07,429 --> 02:47:07,439
effort the point is that still the
 

8441
02:47:07,439 --> 02:47:10,610
effort the point is that still the
process is non-linear to go back to what

8442
02:47:10,610 --> 02:47:10,620
process is non-linear to go back to what

the way I see it is you just you are
 

8447
02:47:15,420 --> 02:47:18,410
the way I see it is you just you are
making an effort to to bring all the

02:47:41,030 --> 02:47:41,040
or even
 

8467
02:47:41,040 --> 02:47:43,250
or even
um anticipated you know or like brought

8468
02:47:43,250 --> 02:47:43,260
um anticipated you know or like brought
 

8469
02:47:43,260 --> 02:47:45,170
um anticipated you know or like brought
closer

8470
02:47:45,170 --> 02:47:45,180
closer
 

8471
02:47:45,180 --> 02:47:48,170
closer
there's a famous story about Einstein

8472
02:47:48,170 --> 02:47:48,180
there's a famous story about Einstein
 

8473
02:47:48,180 --> 02:47:50,389
there's a famous story about Einstein
that he used to you know go uh think

8474
02:47:50,389 --> 02:47:50,399
that he used to you know go uh think
 

8475
02:47:50,399 --> 02:47:52,550
that he used to you know go uh think
think and then go for a walk and like he

8476
02:47:52,550 --> 02:47:52,560
think and then go for a walk and like he
 

8477
02:47:52,560 --> 02:47:54,170
think and then go for a walk and like he
would whistle and sometimes so I

8478
02:47:54,170 --> 02:47:54,180
would whistle and sometimes so I
 

8479
02:47:54,180 --> 02:47:55,550
would whistle and sometimes so I
remember the first time I heard the

8480
02:47:55,550 --> 02:47:55,560
remember the first time I heard the
 

8481
02:47:55,560 --> 02:47:56,510
remember the first time I heard the
story

8482
02:47:56,510 --> 02:47:56,520
story
 

8483
02:47:56,520 --> 02:47:58,490
story
I thought how interesting so the

8484
02:47:58,490 --> 02:47:58,500
I thought how interesting so the
 

8485
02:47:58,500 --> 02:48:00,170
I thought how interesting so the
coincidence that he came up to him when

8486
02:48:00,170 --> 02:48:00,180
coincidence that he came up to him when
 

8487
02:48:00,180 --> 02:48:02,210
coincidence that he came up to him when
he was whistling but in fact it's not

8488
02:48:02,210 --> 02:48:02,220
he was whistling but in fact it's not
 

8489
02:48:02,220 --> 02:48:05,590
he was whistling but in fact it's not
this is how it works in some sense that

8490
02:48:05,590 --> 02:48:05,600
this is how it works in some sense that
 

8491
02:48:05,600 --> 02:48:08,389
this is how it works in some sense that
you have to prepare for it but then the

8492
02:48:08,389 --> 02:48:08,399
you have to prepare for it but then the
 

8493
02:48:08,399 --> 02:48:09,950
you have to prepare for it but then the
moment it happens when you stop thinking

8494
02:48:09,950 --> 02:48:09,960
moment it happens when you stop thinking
 

8495
02:48:09,960 --> 02:48:12,830
moment it happens when you stop thinking
actually so the moment of Discovery is

8496
02:48:12,830 --> 02:48:12,840
actually so the moment of Discovery is
 

8497
02:48:12,840 --> 02:48:15,230
actually so the moment of Discovery is
the moment when thinking stops and you

8498
02:48:15,230 --> 02:48:15,240
the moment when thinking stops and you
 

8499
02:48:15,240 --> 02:48:18,309
the moment when thinking stops and you
know you kind of you kind of almost

8500
02:48:18,309 --> 02:48:18,319
know you kind of you kind of almost
 

8501
02:48:18,319 --> 02:48:22,130
know you kind of you kind of almost
become that truth that you're seeking

8502
02:48:22,130 --> 02:48:22,140
become that truth that you're seeking
 

8503
02:48:22,140 --> 02:48:24,170
become that truth that you're seeking
but you cannot do it by Will in some

8504
02:48:24,170 --> 02:48:24,180
but you cannot do it by Will in some
 

8505
02:48:24,180 --> 02:48:26,450
but you cannot do it by Will in some
sense it's some it's kind of like you

8506
02:48:26,450 --> 02:48:26,460
sense it's some it's kind of like you
 

8507
02:48:26,460 --> 02:48:28,190
sense it's some it's kind of like you
know how in eastern tradition they have

8508
02:48:28,190 --> 02:48:28,200
know how in eastern tradition they have
 

8509
02:48:28,200 --> 02:48:30,110
know how in eastern tradition they have
this concept of Satori like in Buddhism

8510
02:48:30,110 --> 02:48:30,120
this concept of Satori like in Buddhism
 

8511
02:48:30,120 --> 02:48:32,150
this concept of Satori like in Buddhism
and Buddhism you have this Satori which

8512
02:48:32,150 --> 02:48:32,160
and Buddhism you have this Satori which
 

8513
02:48:32,160 --> 02:48:33,710
and Buddhism you have this Satori which
is enlightenment

8514
02:48:33,710 --> 02:48:33,720
is enlightenment
 

8515
02:48:33,720 --> 02:48:37,610
is enlightenment
and so the various reports of

8516
02:48:37,610 --> 02:48:37,620
and so the various reports of
 

8517
02:48:37,620 --> 02:48:40,070
and so the various reports of
Buddhist monks or Buddhist Masters who

8518
02:48:40,070 --> 02:48:40,080
Buddhist monks or Buddhist Masters who
 

8519
02:48:40,080 --> 02:48:42,849
Buddhist monks or Buddhist Masters who
have had experience Satori

8520
02:48:42,849 --> 02:48:42,859
have had experience Satori
 

8521
02:48:42,859 --> 02:48:45,170
have had experience Satori
but they say you can't

8522
02:48:45,170 --> 02:48:45,180
but they say you can't
 

8523
02:48:45,180 --> 02:48:48,469
but they say you can't
you can't uh do it by will you cannot

8524
02:48:48,469 --> 02:48:48,479
you can't uh do it by will you cannot
 

8525
02:48:48,479 --> 02:48:49,790
you can't uh do it by will you cannot
make it happen

8526
02:48:49,790 --> 02:48:49,800
make it happen
 

8527
02:48:49,800 --> 02:48:52,010
make it happen
if anything you have to relax to let it

8528
02:48:52,010 --> 02:48:52,020
if anything you have to relax to let it
 

8529
02:48:52,020 --> 02:48:53,510
if anything you have to relax to let it
come to you you know it's kind of like

8530
02:48:53,510 --> 02:48:53,520
come to you you know it's kind of like
 

8531
02:48:53,520 --> 02:48:57,530
come to you you know it's kind of like
that it's kind of like that so

8532
02:48:57,530 --> 02:48:57,540

 

8533
02:48:57,540 --> 02:49:00,050

I think that what matters

8534
02:49:00,050 --> 02:49:00,060
I think that what matters
 

8535
02:49:00,060 --> 02:49:02,210
I think that what matters
but you say how to think the point is

8536
02:49:02,210 --> 02:49:02,220
but you say how to think the point is
 

8537
02:49:02,220 --> 02:49:03,710
but you say how to think the point is
that we're talking about such an

8538
02:49:03,710 --> 02:49:03,720
that we're talking about such an
 

8539
02:49:03,720 --> 02:49:06,950
that we're talking about such an
esoteric area is really esoteric area

8540
02:49:06,950 --> 02:49:06,960
esoteric area is really esoteric area
 

8541
02:49:06,960 --> 02:49:09,410
esoteric area is really esoteric area
it's really strange subject where you

8542
02:49:09,410 --> 02:49:09,420
it's really strange subject where you
 

8543
02:49:09,420 --> 02:49:10,490
it's really strange subject where you
try to

8544
02:49:10,490 --> 02:49:10,500
try to
 

8545
02:49:10,500 --> 02:49:12,230
try to
to fit everything

8546
02:49:12,230 --> 02:49:12,240
to fit everything
 

8547
02:49:12,240 --> 02:49:16,990
to fit everything
in this very very stringent set of rules

8548
02:49:16,990 --> 02:49:17,000
in this very very stringent set of rules
 

8549
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:20,090
in this very very stringent set of rules
those rules isn't it basically the the

8550
02:49:20,090 --> 02:49:20,100
those rules isn't it basically the the
 

8551
02:49:20,100 --> 02:49:22,910
those rules isn't it basically the the
pure the hardest manifestation of a

8552
02:49:22,910 --> 02:49:22,920
pure the hardest manifestation of a
 

8553
02:49:22,920 --> 02:49:24,170
pure the hardest manifestation of a
puzzle that we're all solving in

8554
02:49:24,170 --> 02:49:24,180
puzzle that we're all solving in
 

8555
02:49:24,180 --> 02:49:25,610
puzzle that we're all solving in
different other disciplines but this is

8556
02:49:25,610 --> 02:49:25,620
different other disciplines but this is
 

8557
02:49:25,620 --> 02:49:28,130
different other disciplines but this is
the the hardest puzzle yes and no

8558
02:49:28,130 --> 02:49:28,140
the the hardest puzzle yes and no
 

8559
02:49:28,140 --> 02:49:31,429
the the hardest puzzle yes and no
because there is just a different

8560
02:49:31,429 --> 02:49:31,439
because there is just a different
 

8561
02:49:31,439 --> 02:49:32,510
because there is just a different
for instance there is a different

8562
02:49:32,510 --> 02:49:32,520
for instance there is a different
 

8563
02:49:32,520 --> 02:49:34,910
for instance there is a different
Criterion for what constitutes progress

8564
02:49:34,910 --> 02:49:34,920
Criterion for what constitutes progress
 

8565
02:49:34,920 --> 02:49:37,130
Criterion for what constitutes progress
for instance physics

8566
02:49:37,130 --> 02:49:37,140
for instance physics
 

8567
02:49:37,140 --> 02:49:38,990
for instance physics
a lot of arguments they make they are

8568
02:49:38,990 --> 02:49:39,000
a lot of arguments they make they are
 

8569
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:40,790
a lot of arguments they make they are
not rigors from mathematical perspective

8570
02:49:40,790 --> 02:49:40,800
not rigors from mathematical perspective
 

8571
02:49:40,800 --> 02:49:42,889
not rigors from mathematical perspective
it is kind of an intuitive argument we

8572
02:49:42,889 --> 02:49:42,899
it is kind of an intuitive argument we
 

8573
02:49:42,899 --> 02:49:44,450
it is kind of an intuitive argument we
think it is like this and this is

8574
02:49:44,450 --> 02:49:44,460
think it is like this and this is
 

8575
02:49:44,460 --> 02:49:46,730
think it is like this and this is
acceptable in the subject for a good

8576
02:49:46,730 --> 02:49:46,740
acceptable in the subject for a good
 

8577
02:49:46,740 --> 02:49:49,429
acceptable in the subject for a good
reason and on the so there is some play

8578
02:49:49,429 --> 02:49:49,439
reason and on the so there is some play
 

8579
02:49:49,439 --> 02:49:51,469
reason and on the so there is some play
it's more it's more like human activity

8580
02:49:51,469 --> 02:49:51,479
it's more it's more like human activity
 

8581
02:49:51,479 --> 02:49:53,570
it's more it's more like human activity
day-to-day activity like for instance if

8582
02:49:53,570 --> 02:49:53,580
day-to-day activity like for instance if
 

8583
02:49:53,580 --> 02:49:56,030
day-to-day activity like for instance if
you and I discuss something you have an

8584
02:49:56,030 --> 02:49:56,040
you and I discuss something you have an
 

8585
02:49:56,040 --> 02:49:57,770
you and I discuss something you have an
idea and I have an idea and we argue

8586
02:49:57,770 --> 02:49:57,780
idea and I have an idea and we argue
 

8587
02:49:57,780 --> 02:49:59,570
idea and I have an idea and we argue
about it and something seems more

8588
02:49:59,570 --> 02:49:59,580
about it and something seems more
 

8589
02:49:59,580 --> 02:50:00,590
about it and something seems more
plausible

8590
02:50:00,590 --> 02:50:00,600
plausible
 

8591
02:50:00,600 --> 02:50:03,170
plausible
something seems less plausible and so we

8592
02:50:03,170 --> 02:50:03,180
something seems less plausible and so we
 

8593
02:50:03,180 --> 02:50:05,270
something seems less plausible and so we
made decide to take this point of view

8594
02:50:05,270 --> 02:50:05,280
made decide to take this point of view
 

8595
02:50:05,280 --> 02:50:07,190
made decide to take this point of view
of that point of view as a provisional

8596
02:50:07,190 --> 02:50:07,200
of that point of view as a provisional
 

8597
02:50:07,200 --> 02:50:08,929
of that point of view as a provisional
sort of like

8598
02:50:08,929 --> 02:50:08,939
sort of like
 

8599
02:50:08,939 --> 02:50:11,870
sort of like
point of view and go with it in

8600
02:50:11,870 --> 02:50:11,880
point of view and go with it in
 

8601
02:50:11,880 --> 02:50:13,969
point of view and go with it in
mathematics it doesn't work this way you

8602
02:50:13,969 --> 02:50:13,979
mathematics it doesn't work this way you
 

8603
02:50:13,979 --> 02:50:15,469
mathematics it doesn't work this way you
either prove it or you don't

8604
02:50:15,469 --> 02:50:15,479
either prove it or you don't
 

8605
02:50:15,479 --> 02:50:18,410
either prove it or you don't
and oftentimes

8606
02:50:18,410 --> 02:50:18,420
and oftentimes
 

8607
02:50:18,420 --> 02:50:20,450
and oftentimes
you get to the point where there is this

8608
02:50:20,450 --> 02:50:20,460
you get to the point where there is this
 

8609
02:50:20,460 --> 02:50:22,490
you get to the point where there is this
much you need to prove and it just it

8610
02:50:22,490 --> 02:50:22,500
much you need to prove and it just it
 

8611
02:50:22,500 --> 02:50:24,530
much you need to prove and it just it
just wouldn't it wouldn't come to you

8612
02:50:24,530 --> 02:50:24,540
just wouldn't it wouldn't come to you
 

8613
02:50:24,540 --> 02:50:27,110
just wouldn't it wouldn't come to you
and you just don't see it and it can

8614
02:50:27,110 --> 02:50:27,120
and you just don't see it and it can
 

8615
02:50:27,120 --> 02:50:30,349
and you just don't see it and it can
have it can go on for months

8616
02:50:30,349 --> 02:50:30,359
have it can go on for months
 

8617
02:50:30,359 --> 02:50:33,410
have it can go on for months
super frustrating but without it it is

8618
02:50:33,410 --> 02:50:33,420
super frustrating but without it it is
 

8619
02:50:33,420 --> 02:50:36,110
super frustrating but without it it is
it is nothing kind of you know I would

8620
02:50:36,110 --> 02:50:36,120
it is nothing kind of you know I would
 

8621
02:50:36,120 --> 02:50:38,210
it is nothing kind of you know I would
love to hear your opinion uh to the

8622
02:50:38,210 --> 02:50:38,220
love to hear your opinion uh to the
 

8623
02:50:38,220 --> 02:50:40,790
love to hear your opinion uh to the

announced a mathematician from Princeton

8786
02:53:52,969 --> 02:53:52,979
announced a mathematician from Princeton
 

8787
02:53:52,979 --> 02:53:55,969
announced a mathematician from Princeton
University announced the proof and it

8788
02:53:55,969 --> 02:53:55,979
University announced the proof and it
 

8789
02:53:55,979 --> 02:53:57,650
University announced the proof and it
was very exciting because he was one of

8790
02:53:57,650 --> 02:53:57,660
was very exciting because he was one of
 

8791
02:53:57,660 --> 02:54:00,410
was very exciting because he was one of
the top number theorists in the world

8792
02:54:00,410 --> 02:54:00,420
the top number theorists in the world
 

8793
02:54:00,420 --> 02:54:03,230
the top number theorists in the world
and unfortunately about a year later a

8794
02:54:03,230 --> 02:54:03,240
and unfortunately about a year later a
 

8795
02:54:03,240 --> 02:54:05,389
and unfortunately about a year later a
gap was found so that's exactly what we

8796
02:54:05,389 --> 02:54:05,399
gap was found so that's exactly what we
 

8797
02:54:05,399 --> 02:54:07,190
gap was found so that's exactly what we
were talking about earlier you have 99

of the proof this one little thing does

8800
02:54:09,230 --> 02:54:09,240
of the proof this one little thing does
 

8801
02:54:09,240 --> 02:54:12,170
of the proof this one little thing does
not quite connect and this nullifies the

8802
02:54:12,170 --> 02:54:12,180
not quite connect and this nullifies the
 

8803
02:54:12,180 --> 02:54:13,730
not quite connect and this nullifies the
whole thing even though well you could

8804
02:54:13,730 --> 02:54:13,740
whole thing even though well you could
 

8805
02:54:13,740 --> 02:54:15,530
whole thing even though well you could
say there's some interesting ideas but

8806
02:54:15,530 --> 02:54:15,540
say there's some interesting ideas but
 

8807
02:54:15,540 --> 02:54:17,809
say there's some interesting ideas but
it's not the same as actually having a

8808
02:54:17,809 --> 02:54:17,819
it's not the same as actually having a
 

8809
02:54:17,819 --> 02:54:19,849
it's not the same as actually having a
proof so he apparently was really

8810
02:54:19,849 --> 02:54:19,859
proof so he apparently was really
 

8811
02:54:19,859 --> 02:54:22,550
proof so he apparently was really
frustrated and he was really a lot of

8812
02:54:22,550 --> 02:54:22,560
frustrated and he was really a lot of
 

8813
02:54:22,560 --> 02:54:24,050
frustrated and he was really a lot of
people thought that it's going to be

8814
02:54:24,050 --> 02:54:24,060
people thought that it's going to be
 

8815
02:54:24,060 --> 02:54:25,910
people thought that it's going to be
another 100 years or whatever

statement a
 

8877
02:55:32,640 --> 02:55:35,030
statement a
instead you prove that a is equivalent

8878
02:55:35,030 --> 02:55:35,040
instead you prove that a is equivalent
 

8879
02:55:35,040 --> 02:55:35,929
instead you prove that a is equivalent
to B

8880
02:55:35,929 --> 02:55:35,939
to B
 

8881
02:55:35,939 --> 02:55:37,910
to B
so after that if you can prove B this

8882
02:55:37,910 --> 02:55:37,920
so after that if you can prove B this
 

8883
02:55:37,920 --> 02:55:39,410
so after that if you can prove B this
would automatically imply that a is

the right triangles so what is the right

8912
02:56:10,790 --> 02:56:10,800
the right triangles so what is the right
 

8913
02:56:10,800 --> 02:56:12,530
the right triangles so what is the right
triangle it's a triangle in which one of

8914
02:56:12,530 --> 02:56:12,540
triangle it's a triangle in which one of
 

8915
02:56:12,540 --> 02:56:16,190
triangle it's a triangle in which one of
the angles is 90 degrees like this so it

8916
02:56:16,190 --> 02:56:16,200
the angles is 90 degrees like this so it
 

8917
02:56:16,200 --> 02:56:18,410
the angles is 90 degrees like this so it
has three sides the longer side is

8918
02:56:18,410 --> 02:56:18,420
has three sides the longer side is
 

8919
02:56:18,420 --> 02:56:20,090
has three sides the longer side is
called hypotenuse

8920
02:56:20,090 --> 02:56:20,100
called hypotenuse
 

8921
02:56:20,100 --> 02:56:22,190
called hypotenuse
and then there's two other sides so if

8922
02:56:22,190 --> 02:56:22,200
and then there's two other sides so if
 

8923
02:56:22,200 --> 02:56:24,050
and then there's two other sides so if
we denote the high points the lengths of

8924
02:56:24,050 --> 02:56:24,060
we denote the high points the lengths of
 

8925
02:56:24,060 --> 02:56:27,050
we denote the high points the lengths of
hypotenuse by Z and the two other sides

8926
02:56:27,050 --> 02:56:27,060
hypotenuse by Z and the two other sides
 

8927
02:56:27,060 --> 02:56:28,370
hypotenuse by Z and the two other sides
X and Y

8928
02:56:28,370 --> 02:56:28,380
X and Y
 

8929
02:56:28,380 --> 02:56:30,530
X and Y
then Z squared is equal to x squared

8930
02:56:30,530 --> 02:56:30,540
then Z squared is equal to x squared
 

8931
02:56:30,540 --> 02:56:32,870
then Z squared is equal to x squared
plus y squared

8932
02:56:32,870 --> 02:56:32,880
plus y squared
 

8933
02:56:32,880 --> 02:56:34,969
plus y squared
so that's the equation or x squared plus

8934
02:56:34,969 --> 02:56:34,979
so that's the equation or x squared plus
 

8935
02:56:34,979 --> 02:56:38,030
so that's the equation or x squared plus
y squared equals z squared

8936
02:56:38,030 --> 02:56:38,040
y squared equals z squared
 

8937
02:56:38,040 --> 02:56:41,030
y squared equals z squared
and it turns out this equation

8938
02:56:41,030 --> 02:56:41,040
and it turns out this equation
 

8939
02:56:41,040 --> 02:56:43,969
and it turns out this equation
has Solutions in natural numbers

8940
02:56:43,969 --> 02:56:43,979

proof then how many cards were broken

9108
03:00:03,469 --> 03:00:03,479
proof then how many cards were broken
 

9109
03:00:03,479 --> 03:00:05,330
proof then how many cards were broken
that they believed that they found the

9110
03:00:05,330 --> 03:00:05,340
that they believed that they found the
 

9111
03:00:05,340 --> 03:00:07,730
that they believed that they found the
proof and then later it was realized

9112
03:00:07,730 --> 03:00:07,740
proof and then later it was realized
 

9113
03:00:07,740 --> 03:00:10,130
proof and then later it was realized
that the proof was incorrect and so on

9114
03:00:10,130 --> 03:00:10,140
that the proof was incorrect and so on
 

9115
03:00:10,140 --> 03:00:13,130
that the proof was incorrect and so on
and brings us to modern day and one last

03:00:51,050 --> 03:00:51,060
not years yes so he worked he has given
 

9145
03:00:51,060 --> 03:00:53,269
not years yes so he worked he has given
interviews about it afterwards so we

9146
03:00:53,269 --> 03:00:53,279
interviews about it afterwards so we
 

9147
03:00:53,279 --> 03:00:55,730
interviews about it afterwards so we
know that he described his process

9148
03:00:55,730 --> 03:00:55,740
know that he described his process

anybody
 

9153
03:00:59,700 --> 03:01:01,910
anybody
because he was afraid that people find

9154
03:01:01,910 --> 03:01:01,920
because he was afraid that people find
 

9155
03:01:01,920 --> 03:01:04,370
because he was afraid that people find
out that he's working on it

9156
03:01:04,370 --> 03:01:04,380
out that he's working on it
 

9157
03:01:04,380 --> 03:01:06,650
out that he's working on it
because he's was such a top level

9158
03:01:06,650 --> 03:01:06,660
because he's was such a top level

mathematician

9160
03:01:08,090 --> 03:01:08,100
mathematician
 

9161
03:01:08,100 --> 03:01:10,550
mathematician
people would guess that he has some idea

9162
03:01:10,550 --> 03:01:10,560
people would guess that he has some idea
 

9163
03:01:10,560 --> 03:01:13,190
people would guess that he has some idea
that there is some idea so you know

9164
03:01:13,190 --> 03:01:13,200
that there is some idea so you know
 

9165
03:01:13,200 --> 03:01:16,309
that there is some idea so you know
if you just know that somebody's has an

9166
03:01:16,309 --> 03:01:16,319
if you just know that somebody's has an
 

9167
03:01:16,319 --> 03:01:17,870
if you just know that somebody's has an
idea this already gives you a great

9168
03:01:17,870 --> 03:01:17,880
idea this already gives you a great
 

9169
03:01:17,880 --> 03:01:20,510
idea this already gives you a great
boost of confidence right so he didn't

9170
03:01:20,510 --> 03:01:20,520
boost of confidence right so he didn't
 

9171
03:01:20,520 --> 03:01:23,570
boost of confidence right so he didn't
want people to have that information so

9172
03:01:23,570 --> 03:01:23,580
want people to have that information so
 

9173
03:01:23,580 --> 03:01:24,889
want people to have that information so
he didn't tell anybody that he was

9174
03:01:24,889 --> 03:01:24,899
he didn't tell anybody that he was
 

9175
03:01:24,899 --> 03:01:26,870
he didn't tell anybody that he was
working on it number one be lonely

9176
03:01:26,870 --> 03:01:26,880
working on it number one be lonely
 

9177
03:01:26,880 --> 03:01:29,210
working on it number one be lonely
number two he worked on it for seven

9178
03:01:29,210 --> 03:01:29,220
number two he worked on it for seven
 

9179
03:01:29,220 --> 03:01:32,570
number two he worked on it for seven
years if I remember correctly by himself

9180
03:01:32,570 --> 03:01:32,580
years if I remember correctly by himself
 

9181
03:01:32,580 --> 03:01:33,950
years if I remember correctly by himself
and

9182
03:01:33,950 --> 03:01:33,960
and
 

9183
03:01:33,960 --> 03:01:37,370
and
then then he he thought he had it and he

9184
03:01:37,370 --> 03:01:37,380
then then he he thought he had it and he
 

9185
03:01:37,380 --> 03:01:39,590
then then he he thought he had it and he
was elated obviously he was you know

9186
03:01:39,590 --> 03:01:39,600
was elated obviously he was you know
 

9187
03:01:39,600 --> 03:01:42,710
was elated obviously he was you know
very happy and he announced it at the

9188
03:01:42,710 --> 03:01:42,720
very happy and he announced it at the
 

9189
03:01:42,720 --> 03:01:44,090
very happy and he announced it at the
conference I think it was in Cambridge

9190
03:01:44,090 --> 03:01:44,100
conference I think it was in Cambridge
 

9191
03:01:44,100 --> 03:01:45,950
conference I think it was in Cambridge
University or Oxford University in the

9192
03:01:45,950 --> 03:01:45,960
University or Oxford University in the
 

9193
03:01:45,960 --> 03:01:48,650
University or Oxford University in the
UK in 1993 I believe

9194
03:01:48,650 --> 03:01:48,660
UK in 1993 I believe
 

9195
03:01:48,660 --> 03:01:50,030
UK in 1993 I believe
so

9196
03:01:50,030 --> 03:01:50,040
so
 

9197
03:01:50,040 --> 03:01:52,309
so
you know

9198
03:01:52,309 --> 03:01:52,319
you know
 

9199
03:01:52,319 --> 03:01:53,809
you know
this

9200
03:01:53,809 --> 03:01:53,819
this
 

9201
03:01:53,819 --> 03:01:57,110
this
is really interesting because all of us

9202
03:01:57,110 --> 03:01:57,120
is really interesting because all of us
 

9203
03:01:57,120 --> 03:01:58,910
is really interesting because all of us
we can really all weapons can relate to

9204
03:01:58,910 --> 03:01:58,920
we can really all weapons can relate to
 

9205
03:01:58,920 --> 03:02:01,070
we can really all weapons can relate to
this because I I remember very well my

9206
03:02:01,070 --> 03:02:01,080
this because I I remember very well my
 

9207
03:02:01,080 --> 03:02:03,050
this because I I remember very well my
first problem how I solved my first

9208
03:02:03,050 --> 03:02:03,060
first problem how I solved my first
 

9209
03:02:03,060 --> 03:02:04,010
first problem how I solved my first
problem

9210
03:02:04,010 --> 03:02:04,020
problem
 

9211
03:02:04,020 --> 03:02:07,969
problem
uh I described it in 11 math in my book

9212
03:02:07,969 --> 03:02:07,979
uh I described it in 11 math in my book
 

9213
03:02:07,979 --> 03:02:08,870
uh I described it in 11 math in my book
so

9214
03:02:08,870 --> 03:02:08,880
so
 

9215
03:02:08,880 --> 03:02:13,010
so
uh it was I was how old was I I was 18

9216
03:02:13,010 --> 03:02:13,020
uh it was I was how old was I I was 18
 

9217
03:02:13,020 --> 03:02:16,370
uh it was I was how old was I I was 18
years old I was a student in Moscow

9218
03:02:16,370 --> 03:02:16,380
years old I was a student in Moscow
 

9219
03:02:16,380 --> 03:02:18,950
years old I was a student in Moscow
and I was just I just lucked out that I

9220
03:02:18,950 --> 03:02:18,960
and I was just I just lucked out that I
 

9221
03:02:18,960 --> 03:02:20,030
and I was just I just lucked out that I
was introduced to this great

9222
03:02:20,030 --> 03:02:20,040
was introduced to this great
 

9223
03:02:20,040 --> 03:02:23,150
was introduced to this great
mathematician since I you know I was not

9224
03:02:23,150 --> 03:02:23,160
mathematician since I you know I was not
 

9225
03:02:23,160 --> 03:02:25,070
mathematician since I you know I was not
studying at Moscow University because of

9226
03:02:25,070 --> 03:02:25,080
studying at Moscow University because of
 

9227
03:02:25,080 --> 03:02:26,870
studying at Moscow University because of
anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union so I

9228
03:02:26,870 --> 03:02:26,880
anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union so I
 

9229
03:02:26,880 --> 03:02:29,030
anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union so I
was in this technical school but I was

9230
03:02:29,030 --> 03:02:29,040
was in this technical school but I was
 

9231
03:02:29,040 --> 03:02:30,830
was in this technical school but I was
lucky that I had a mathematician who

9232
03:02:30,830 --> 03:02:30,840
lucky that I had a mathematician who
 

9233
03:02:30,840 --> 03:02:33,710
lucky that I had a mathematician who
took me under his wing

9234
03:02:33,710 --> 03:02:33,720
took me under his wing
 

9235
03:02:33,720 --> 03:02:36,950
took me under his wing
and Dmitry Fox who actually

9236
03:02:36,950 --> 03:02:36,960
and Dmitry Fox who actually
 

9237
03:02:36,960 --> 03:02:39,889
and Dmitry Fox who actually
later came to the to the US and he's

9238
03:02:39,889 --> 03:02:39,899
later came to the to the US and he's
 

9239
03:02:39,899 --> 03:02:42,889
later came to the to the US and he's
still a professor at the UC Davis

9240
03:02:42,889 --> 03:02:42,899
still a professor at the UC Davis
 

9241
03:02:42,899 --> 03:02:45,410
still a professor at the UC Davis
not so far from from me

9242
03:02:45,410 --> 03:02:45,420
not so far from from me
 

9243
03:02:45,420 --> 03:02:48,950
not so far from from me
uh so he gave me this problem and

9244
03:02:48,950 --> 03:02:48,960
uh so he gave me this problem and
 

9245
03:02:48,960 --> 03:02:50,630
uh so he gave me this problem and
it was rather technical so I will not

9246
03:02:50,630 --> 03:02:50,640
it was rather technical so I will not
 

9247
03:02:50,640 --> 03:02:53,030
it was rather technical so I will not
try to describe it but I do remember how

9248
03:02:53,030 --> 03:02:53,040
try to describe it but I do remember how
 

9249
03:02:53,040 --> 03:02:56,150
try to describe it but I do remember how
much uh effort you know the that

9250
03:02:56,150 --> 03:02:56,160
much uh effort you know the that
 

9251
03:02:56,160 --> 03:02:58,670
much uh effort you know the that
excitement but also kind of a fear what

9252
03:02:58,670 --> 03:02:58,680
excitement but also kind of a fear what
 

9253
03:02:58,680 --> 03:03:01,550
excitement but also kind of a fear what
if I don't have what it takes you know I

9254
03:03:01,550 --> 03:03:01,560
if I don't have what it takes you know I
 

9255
03:03:01,560 --> 03:03:03,349
if I don't have what it takes you know I
lost sleep so this was one one

9256
03:03:03,349 --> 03:03:03,359
lost sleep so this was one one
 

9257
03:03:03,359 --> 03:03:04,790
lost sleep so this was one one
consequence of this

9258
03:03:04,790 --> 03:03:04,800
consequence of this
 

9259
03:03:04,800 --> 03:03:06,889
consequence of this
I for the first time in my life I had

9260
03:03:06,889 --> 03:03:06,899
I for the first time in my life I had
 

9261
03:03:06,899 --> 03:03:08,389
I for the first time in my life I had
trouble falling asleep and this actually

9262
03:03:08,389 --> 03:03:08,399
trouble falling asleep and this actually
 

9263
03:03:08,399 --> 03:03:11,389
trouble falling asleep and this actually
stayed for a couple years afterwards so

9264
03:03:11,389 --> 03:03:11,399
stayed for a couple years afterwards so
 

9265
03:03:11,399 --> 03:03:12,830
stayed for a couple years afterwards so
then it was kind of like a wake-up call

9266
03:03:12,830 --> 03:03:12,840
then it was kind of like a wake-up call
 

9267
03:03:12,840 --> 03:03:14,330
then it was kind of like a wake-up call
that I should be to take care of myself

9268
03:03:14,330 --> 03:03:14,340
that I should be to take care of myself
 

9269
03:03:14,340 --> 03:03:16,730
that I should be to take care of myself
not work too late and so on so that was

9270
03:03:16,730 --> 03:03:16,740
not work too late and so on so that was
 

9271
03:03:16,740 --> 03:03:19,370
not work too late and so on so that was
sort of like that experience and I was

9272
03:03:19,370 --> 03:03:19,380
sort of like that experience and I was
 

9273
03:03:19,380 --> 03:03:21,170
sort of like that experience and I was
lucky that I was able to find a solution

9274
03:03:21,170 --> 03:03:21,180
lucky that I was able to find a solution
 

9275
03:03:21,180 --> 03:03:23,870
lucky that I was able to find a solution
number one within two months Maybe

9276
03:03:23,870 --> 03:03:23,880
number one within two months Maybe
 

9277
03:03:23,880 --> 03:03:26,450
number one within two months Maybe
and it was very it was surprising and it

9278
03:03:26,450 --> 03:03:26,460
and it was very it was surprising and it
 

9279
03:03:26,460 --> 03:03:28,730
and it was very it was surprising and it
was beautiful like it the answer was was

9280
03:03:28,730 --> 03:03:28,740
was beautiful like it the answer was was
 

9281
03:03:28,740 --> 03:03:30,710
was beautiful like it the answer was was
in terms of some something which seemed

9282
03:03:30,710 --> 03:03:30,720
in terms of some something which seemed
 

9283
03:03:30,720 --> 03:03:32,210
in terms of some something which seemed
to be from A Different World from a

9284
03:03:32,210 --> 03:03:32,220
to be from A Different World from a
 

9285
03:03:32,220 --> 03:03:34,010
to be from A Different World from a
different area of mathematics

9286
03:03:34,010 --> 03:03:34,020
different area of mathematics
 

9287
03:03:34,020 --> 03:03:36,889
different area of mathematics
so it's very happy but I do remember

9288
03:03:36,889 --> 03:03:36,899
so it's very happy but I do remember
 

9289
03:03:36,899 --> 03:03:39,170
so it's very happy but I do remember
this more this moment when suddenly you

9290
03:03:39,170 --> 03:03:39,180
this more this moment when suddenly you
 

9291
03:03:39,180 --> 03:03:40,550
this more this moment when suddenly you
see that

9292
03:03:40,550 --> 03:03:40,560
see that
 

9293
03:03:40,560 --> 03:03:43,070
see that
it's like you in this case it was

9294
03:03:43,070 --> 03:03:43,080
it's like you in this case it was
 

9295
03:03:43,080 --> 03:03:44,990
it's like you in this case it was
literally I had to compile these

9296
03:03:44,990 --> 03:03:45,000
literally I had to compile these
 

9297
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:47,450
literally I had to compile these
diagrams with what mathematicians call

9298
03:03:47,450 --> 03:03:47,460
diagrams with what mathematicians call
 

9299
03:03:47,460 --> 03:03:49,389
diagrams with what mathematicians call
homology groups and spectral sequences

9300
03:03:49,389 --> 03:03:49,399
homology groups and spectral sequences
 

9301
03:03:49,399 --> 03:03:52,969
homology groups and spectral sequences
and manually calculate some some numbers

9302
03:03:52,969 --> 03:03:52,979
and manually calculate some some numbers
 

9303
03:03:52,979 --> 03:03:55,550
and manually calculate some some numbers
and trying to discern some system in it

9304
03:03:55,550 --> 03:03:55,560
and trying to discern some system in it
 

9305
03:03:55,560 --> 03:03:58,250
and trying to discern some system in it
and suddenly I saw that how they all

9306
03:03:58,250 --> 03:03:58,260
and suddenly I saw that how they all
 

9307
03:03:58,260 --> 03:04:01,550
and suddenly I saw that how they all
were governed by this one one force so

9308
03:04:01,550 --> 03:04:01,560
were governed by this one one force so
 

9309
03:04:01,560 --> 03:04:03,950
were governed by this one one force so
to speak one pattern and that was

9310
03:04:03,950 --> 03:04:03,960
to speak one pattern and that was
 

9311
03:04:03,960 --> 03:04:08,090
to speak one pattern and that was
absolutely wow so it's like I mean what

9312
03:04:08,090 --> 03:04:08,100
absolutely wow so it's like I mean what
 

9313
03:04:08,100 --> 03:04:10,309
absolutely wow so it's like I mean what
was it so you're sitting there at a desk

9314
03:04:10,309 --> 03:04:10,319
was it so you're sitting there at a desk
 

9315
03:04:10,319 --> 03:04:12,349
was it so you're sitting there at a desk
actually you know I lived in a town

9316
03:04:12,349 --> 03:04:12,359
actually you know I lived in a town
 

9317
03:04:12,359 --> 03:04:14,630
actually you know I lived in a town
outside of Moscow so I used to take I

9318
03:04:14,630 --> 03:04:14,640
outside of Moscow so I used to take I
 

9319
03:04:14,640 --> 03:04:16,250
outside of Moscow so I used to take I
would take a train to Moscow so it's

9320
03:04:16,250 --> 03:04:16,260
would take a train to Moscow so it's
 

9321
03:04:16,260 --> 03:04:18,050
would take a train to Moscow so it's
what we call in Russia electric you know

9322
03:04:18,050 --> 03:04:18,060
what we call in Russia electric you know
 

9323
03:04:18,060 --> 03:04:19,849
what we call in Russia electric you know
like this electric train which was super

9324
03:04:19,849 --> 03:04:19,859
like this electric train which was super
 

9325
03:04:19,859 --> 03:04:22,190
like this electric train which was super
slow it took more than two hours to

9326
03:04:22,190 --> 03:04:22,200
slow it took more than two hours to
 

9327
03:04:22,200 --> 03:04:24,050
slow it took more than two hours to
cover that distance and I think that the

9328
03:04:24,050 --> 03:04:24,060
cover that distance and I think that the
 

9329
03:04:24,060 --> 03:04:26,050
cover that distance and I think that the
crucial Insight came when I was in this

9330
03:04:26,050 --> 03:04:26,060
crucial Insight came when I was in this
 

9331
03:04:26,060 --> 03:04:29,150
crucial Insight came when I was in this
and I just I was I had to contain myself

9332
03:04:29,150 --> 03:04:29,160
and I just I was I had to contain myself
 

9333
03:04:29,160 --> 03:04:30,590
and I just I was I had to contain myself
so I don't start screaming you know

9334
03:04:30,590 --> 03:04:30,600
so I don't start screaming you know
 

9335
03:04:30,600 --> 03:04:33,110
so I don't start screaming you know
because there were other passengers in

9336
03:04:33,110 --> 03:04:33,120
because there were other passengers in
 

9337
03:04:33,120 --> 03:04:37,190
because there were other passengers in
the car so I was sitting there and

9338
03:04:37,190 --> 03:04:37,200
the car so I was sitting there and
 

9339
03:04:37,200 --> 03:04:41,030
the car so I was sitting there and
staring at this paper so you know what I

9340
03:04:41,030 --> 03:04:41,040
staring at this paper so you know what I
 

9341
03:04:41,040 --> 03:04:42,950
staring at this paper so you know what I
remember that what came to me

9342
03:04:42,950 --> 03:04:42,960
remember that what came to me
 

9343
03:04:42,960 --> 03:04:45,170
remember that what came to me
I have something now

9344
03:04:45,170 --> 03:04:45,180
I have something now
 

9345
03:04:45,180 --> 03:04:47,450
I have something now
which nobody else in the world has I

9346
03:04:47,450 --> 03:04:47,460
which nobody else in the world has I
 

9347
03:04:47,460 --> 03:04:49,130
which nobody else in the world has I
have a proof of first of all I did not

9348
03:04:49,130 --> 03:04:49,140
have a proof of first of all I did not
 

9349
03:04:49,140 --> 03:04:50,690
have a proof of first of all I did not
it was not just the proof like in the

9350
03:04:50,690 --> 03:04:50,700
it was not just the proof like in the
 

9351
03:04:50,700 --> 03:04:52,670
it was not just the proof like in the
case of Irma the statement is already

9352
03:04:52,670 --> 03:04:52,680
case of Irma the statement is already
 

9353
03:04:52,680 --> 03:04:54,410
case of Irma the statement is already
made that's why it's called conjecture

9354
03:04:54,410 --> 03:04:54,420
made that's why it's called conjecture
 

9355
03:04:54,420 --> 03:04:56,150
made that's why it's called conjecture
you know you make a statement you don't

9356
03:04:56,150 --> 03:04:56,160
you know you make a statement you don't
 

9357
03:04:56,160 --> 03:04:58,070
you know you make a statement you don't
have a proof yet then you try to prove

9358
03:04:58,070 --> 03:04:58,080
have a proof yet then you try to prove
 

9359
03:04:58,080 --> 03:04:59,630
have a proof yet then you try to prove
it in my case I did not know what the

9360
03:04:59,630 --> 03:04:59,640
it in my case I did not know what the
 

9361
03:04:59,640 --> 03:05:01,429
it in my case I did not know what the
answer would be there was a type of

9362
03:05:01,429 --> 03:05:01,439
answer would be there was a type of
 

9363
03:05:01,439 --> 03:05:04,010
answer would be there was a type of
question where the answer was unknown so

9364
03:05:04,010 --> 03:05:04,020
question where the answer was unknown so
 

9365
03:05:04,020 --> 03:05:06,290
question where the answer was unknown so
I had to find the answer and prove it

9366
03:05:06,290 --> 03:05:06,300
I had to find the answer and prove it
 

9367
03:05:06,300 --> 03:05:08,690
I had to find the answer and prove it
and the answer was very nice so nobody

9368
03:05:08,690 --> 03:05:08,700
and the answer was very nice so nobody
 

9369
03:05:08,700 --> 03:05:10,670
and the answer was very nice so nobody
knew as far as I could tell nobody knew

9370
03:05:10,670 --> 03:05:10,680
knew as far as I could tell nobody knew
 

9371
03:05:10,680 --> 03:05:13,429
knew as far as I could tell nobody knew
because my teacher told me that he

9372
03:05:13,429 --> 03:05:13,439
because my teacher told me that he
 

9373
03:05:13,439 --> 03:05:15,349
because my teacher told me that he
explored all the literature and this was

9374
03:05:15,349 --> 03:05:15,359
explored all the literature and this was
 

9375
03:05:15,359 --> 03:05:17,990
explored all the literature and this was
not known so this was

9376
03:05:17,990 --> 03:05:18,000
not known so this was
 

9377
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:21,170
not known so this was
suddenly I felt that I was in possession

9378
03:05:21,170 --> 03:05:21,180
suddenly I felt that I was in possession
 

9379
03:05:21,180 --> 03:05:23,330
suddenly I felt that I was in possession
of this

9380
03:05:23,330 --> 03:05:23,340
of this
 

9381
03:05:23,340 --> 03:05:25,429
of this
now it was a little thing it was not

9382
03:05:25,429 --> 03:05:25,439
now it was a little thing it was not
 

9383
03:05:25,439 --> 03:05:28,849
now it was a little thing it was not
cured for cancer you know it was not

9384
03:05:28,849 --> 03:05:28,859
cured for cancer you know it was not
 

9385
03:05:28,859 --> 03:05:31,730
cured for cancer you know it was not
a large language model you know but it

9386
03:05:31,730 --> 03:05:31,740
a large language model you know but it
 

9387
03:05:31,740 --> 03:05:36,050
a large language model you know but it
was something undeniably real meaningful

9388
03:05:36,050 --> 03:05:36,060
was something undeniably real meaningful
 

9389
03:05:36,060 --> 03:05:38,150
was something undeniably real meaningful
and it was mine kind of you know like I

9390
03:05:38,150 --> 03:05:38,160
and it was mine kind of you know like I
 

9391
03:05:38,160 --> 03:05:39,769
and it was mine kind of you know like I
had it nobody else I had not published

9392
03:05:39,769 --> 03:05:39,779
had it nobody else I had not published
 

9393
03:05:39,779 --> 03:05:41,389
had it nobody else I had not published
it I didn't even tell I hadn't even told

9394
03:05:41,389 --> 03:05:41,399
it I didn't even tell I hadn't even told
 

9395
03:05:41,399 --> 03:05:43,490
it I didn't even tell I hadn't even told
anybody and it is a very strange feeling

9396
03:05:43,490 --> 03:05:43,500
anybody and it is a very strange feeling
 

9397
03:05:43,500 --> 03:05:45,950
anybody and it is a very strange feeling
you know to have to have that were you

9398
03:05:45,950 --> 03:05:45,960
you know to have to have that were you
 

9399
03:05:45,960 --> 03:05:47,450
you know to have to have that were you
worried that this treasure could be

9400
03:05:47,450 --> 03:05:47,460
worried that this treasure could be
 

9401
03:05:47,460 --> 03:05:48,590
worried that this treasure could be
stolen

9402
03:05:48,590 --> 03:05:48,600
stolen
 

9403
03:05:48,600 --> 03:05:51,349
stolen
not at the time not at the time so later

9404
03:05:51,349 --> 03:05:51,359
not at the time not at the time so later
 

9405
03:05:51,359 --> 03:05:53,690
not at the time not at the time so later
on there were situations where I was

9406
03:05:53,690 --> 03:05:53,700
on there were situations where I was
 

9407
03:05:53,700 --> 03:05:54,950
on there were situations where I was
exposed to that those type of

9408
03:05:54,950 --> 03:05:54,960
exposed to that those type of
 

9409
03:05:54,960 --> 03:05:56,210
exposed to that those type of
experiences but at that time I didn't

9410
03:05:56,210 --> 03:05:56,220
experiences but at that time I didn't
 

9411
03:05:56,220 --> 03:05:58,210
experiences but at that time I didn't

um I think we can definitely do better
and I think the first step is to kind of

9464
03:07:05,230 --> 03:07:05,240
and I think the first step is to kind of
 

9465
03:07:05,240 --> 03:07:10,429
and I think the first step is to kind of
admit that we are not 100 Seekers of

this has not happened yet there have

9480
03:07:28,070 --> 03:07:28,080
this has not happened yet there have
 

9481
03:07:28,080 --> 03:07:29,750
this has not happened yet there have
been some famous cases where people have

9482
03:07:29,750 --> 03:07:29,760
been some famous cases where people have

and uh everybody knows it but there
 

9489
03:07:37,319 --> 03:07:39,469
and uh everybody knows it but there
isn't a systematic effort as far as I

9490
03:07:39,469 --> 03:07:39,479
isn't a systematic effort as far as I
 

9491
03:07:39,479 --> 03:07:42,889
isn't a systematic effort as far as I
can tell of really trying to create some

9492
03:07:42,889 --> 03:07:42,899
can tell of really trying to create some
 

9493
03:07:42,899 --> 03:07:45,530
can tell of really trying to create some
rules some ethics rules this is this is

9494
03:07:45,530 --> 03:07:45,540
rules some ethics rules this is this is
 

9495
03:07:45,540 --> 03:07:47,750
rules some ethics rules this is this is
fair game this is not fair game so that

9496
03:07:47,750 --> 03:07:47,760
fair game this is not fair game so that
 

9497
03:07:47,760 --> 03:07:50,690
fair game this is not fair game so that
as a community we strive to get better

9498
03:07:50,690 --> 03:07:50,700
as a community we strive to get better
 

9499
03:07:50,700 --> 03:07:53,210
as a community we strive to get better
I think that for most people it's more

9500
03:07:53,210 --> 03:07:53,220
I think that for most people it's more
 

9501
03:07:53,220 --> 03:07:55,490
I think that for most people it's more
like keeping your head in the sand and

9502
03:07:55,490 --> 03:07:55,500
like keeping your head in the sand and
 

9503
03:07:55,500 --> 03:07:56,809
like keeping your head in the sand and
kind of pretending that it doesn't

9504
03:07:56,809 --> 03:07:56,819
kind of pretending that it doesn't
 

9505
03:07:56,819 --> 03:07:59,090
kind of pretending that it doesn't
happen or it happens some isolated

9506
03:07:59,090 --> 03:07:59,100
happen or it happens some isolated
 

9507
03:07:59,100 --> 03:08:01,370
happen or it happens some isolated
incidents well I don't my experience is

9508
03:08:01,370 --> 03:08:01,380
incidents well I don't my experience is
 

9509
03:08:01,380 --> 03:08:03,230
incidents well I don't my experience is
not like that at all I think it does

9510
03:08:03,230 --> 03:08:03,240
not like that at all I think it does
 

9511
03:08:03,240 --> 03:08:05,690
not like that at all I think it does
happen much more often than it should

9512
03:08:05,690 --> 03:08:05,700
happen much more often than it should
 

9513
03:08:05,700 --> 03:08:08,929
happen much more often than it should
that's my opinion uh so there's the pool

9514
03:08:08,929 --> 03:08:08,939
that's my opinion uh so there's the pool
 

9515
03:08:08,939 --> 03:08:11,450
that's my opinion uh so there's the pool
of Academia is fascinating one of the

9516
03:08:11,450 --> 03:08:11,460
of Academia is fascinating one of the
 

9517
03:08:11,460 --> 03:08:12,830
of Academia is fascinating one of the
reasons I really love it is you have

9518
03:08:12,830 --> 03:08:12,840
reasons I really love it is you have
 

9519
03:08:12,840 --> 03:08:16,429
reasons I really love it is you have
young minds with fresh ideas

9520
03:08:16,429 --> 03:08:16,439
young minds with fresh ideas
 

9521
03:08:16,439 --> 03:08:18,290
young minds with fresh ideas
and that that same innocence you had

9522
03:08:18,290 --> 03:08:18,300
and that that same innocence you had
 

9523
03:08:18,300 --> 03:08:19,849
and that that same innocence you had
with when you're first on the train have

9524
03:08:19,849 --> 03:08:19,859
with when you're first on the train have
 

9525
03:08:19,859 --> 03:08:22,370
with when you're first on the train have
that brilliant breakthrough and then you

9526
03:08:22,370 --> 03:08:22,380
that brilliant breakthrough and then you
 

9527
03:08:22,380 --> 03:08:24,730
that brilliant breakthrough and then you
throw that in together with senior

9528
03:08:24,730 --> 03:08:24,740
throw that in together with senior
 

9529
03:08:24,740 --> 03:08:28,010
throw that in together with senior
exceptional world-class scientists who

9530
03:08:28,010 --> 03:08:28,020
exceptional world-class scientists who
 

9531
03:08:28,020 --> 03:08:32,389
exceptional world-class scientists who
have first of all are getting older

9532
03:08:32,389 --> 03:08:32,399

 

9533
03:08:32,399 --> 03:08:35,090

um second of all maybe they have

9534
03:08:35,090 --> 03:08:35,100
um second of all maybe they have
 

9535
03:08:35,100 --> 03:08:37,849
um second of all maybe they have
partaken in the drug of Fame and money

9536
03:08:37,849 --> 03:08:37,859
partaken in the drug of Fame and money
 

9537
03:08:37,859 --> 03:08:40,910
partaken in the drug of Fame and money
and status and recognition so that

9538
03:08:40,910 --> 03:08:40,920
and status and recognition so that
 

9539
03:08:40,920 --> 03:08:43,670
and status and recognition so that
starts to a little bit corrupt all of

9540
03:08:43,670 --> 03:08:43,680
starts to a little bit corrupt all of
 

9541
03:08:43,680 --> 03:08:46,490
starts to a little bit corrupt all of
our human minds and you throw that mix

9542
03:08:46,490 --> 03:08:46,500
our human minds and you throw that mix
 

9543
03:08:46,500 --> 03:08:48,530
our human minds and you throw that mix
in together yeah

9544
03:08:48,530 --> 03:08:48,540
in together yeah
 

9545
03:08:48,540 --> 03:08:51,110
in together yeah
mostly without rules

9546
03:08:51,110 --> 03:08:51,120
mostly without rules
 

9547
03:08:51,120 --> 03:08:53,990
mostly without rules
and uh is beautiful because that's where

9548
03:08:53,990 --> 03:08:54,000
and uh is beautiful because that's where
 

9549
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:56,590
and uh is beautiful because that's where
the ideas of old

9550
03:08:56,590 --> 03:08:56,600
the ideas of old
 

9551
03:08:56,600 --> 03:08:59,870
the ideas of old
contend with the the new wild-eyed crazy

9552
03:08:59,870 --> 03:08:59,880
contend with the the new wild-eyed crazy
 

9553
03:08:59,880 --> 03:09:02,210
contend with the the new wild-eyed crazy
ideas and they clash and there's a

9554
03:09:02,210 --> 03:09:02,220
ideas and they clash and there's a
 

9555
03:09:02,220 --> 03:09:04,610
ideas and they clash and there's a
tension and it's there's a dance to it

9556
03:09:04,610 --> 03:09:04,620
tension and it's there's a dance to it
 

9557
03:09:04,620 --> 03:09:06,230
tension and it's there's a dance to it
but then there's the old human

9558
03:09:06,230 --> 03:09:06,240
but then there's the old human
 

9559
03:09:06,240 --> 03:09:08,450
but then there's the old human
corruption that can take advantage of

9560
03:09:08,450 --> 03:09:08,460
corruption that can take advantage of
 

9561
03:09:08,460 --> 03:09:10,070
corruption that can take advantage of
the young minds

9562
03:09:10,070 --> 03:09:10,080
the young minds
 

9563
03:09:10,080 --> 03:09:12,469
the young minds
it's unclear what to do with that

9564
03:09:12,469 --> 03:09:12,479
it's unclear what to do with that
 

9565
03:09:12,479 --> 03:09:14,030
it's unclear what to do with that
I mean part of that is just the way of

9566
03:09:14,030 --> 03:09:14,040
I mean part of that is just the way of
 

9567
03:09:14,040 --> 03:09:16,010
I mean part of that is just the way of
life and the strategies

9568
03:09:16,010 --> 03:09:16,020
life and the strategies
 

9569
03:09:16,020 --> 03:09:18,410
life and the strategies
um and oftentimes when you look at who

9570
03:09:18,410 --> 03:09:18,420
um and oftentimes when you look at who
 

9571
03:09:18,420 --> 03:09:20,330
um and oftentimes when you look at who
wins the Nobel Prize it's also tragic

9572
03:09:20,330 --> 03:09:20,340
wins the Nobel Prize it's also tragic
 

9573
03:09:20,340 --> 03:09:23,349
wins the Nobel Prize it's also tragic
because sometimes so many

9574
03:09:23,349 --> 03:09:23,359
because sometimes so many
 

9575
03:09:23,359 --> 03:09:26,809
because sometimes so many
minds are like the trajectory to the

9576
03:09:26,809 --> 03:09:26,819
minds are like the trajectory to the
 

9577
03:09:26,819 --> 03:09:29,269
minds are like the trajectory to the
Breakthrough idea involves so many

9578
03:09:29,269 --> 03:09:29,279
Breakthrough idea involves so many
 

9579
03:09:29,279 --> 03:09:31,670
Breakthrough idea involves so many
different Minds young and old yeah I

9580
03:09:31,670 --> 03:09:31,680
different Minds young and old yeah I
 

9581
03:09:31,680 --> 03:09:34,450
different Minds young and old yeah I
mean

9582
03:09:34,450 --> 03:09:34,460

 

9583
03:09:34,460 --> 03:09:36,950

you're right it's I think it's like

9584
03:09:36,950 --> 03:09:36,960
you're right it's I think it's like
 

9585
03:09:36,960 --> 03:09:38,929
you're right it's I think it's like
every and there was everything else the

9586
03:09:38,929 --> 03:09:38,939
every and there was everything else the
 

9587
03:09:38,939 --> 03:09:41,990
every and there was everything else the
the through the the path is to more

9588
03:09:41,990 --> 03:09:42,000
the through the the path is to more
 

9589
03:09:42,000 --> 03:09:44,210
the through the the path is to more
self-awareness and it's like owning up

9590
03:09:44,210 --> 03:09:44,220
self-awareness and it's like owning up
 

9591
03:09:44,220 --> 03:09:45,469
self-awareness and it's like owning up
your own

9592
03:09:45,469 --> 03:09:45,479
your own
 

9593
03:09:45,479 --> 03:09:48,349
your own
stuff and uh not blaming other people

9594
03:09:48,349 --> 03:09:48,359
stuff and uh not blaming other people
 

9595
03:09:48,359 --> 03:09:50,330
stuff and uh not blaming other people
not projecting onto other people but

9596
03:09:50,330 --> 03:09:50,340
not projecting onto other people but
 

9597
03:09:50,340 --> 03:09:51,950
not projecting onto other people but
taking responsibility

9598
03:09:51,950 --> 03:09:51,960
taking responsibility
 

9599
03:09:51,960 --> 03:09:54,889
taking responsibility
and that's true for everything and

9600
03:09:54,889 --> 03:09:54,899
and that's true for everything and
 

9601
03:09:54,899 --> 03:09:57,830
and that's true for everything and
the problem here unique problem for

9602
03:09:57,830 --> 03:09:57,840
the problem here unique problem for
 

9603
03:09:57,840 --> 03:09:59,389
the problem here unique problem for
mathematics I would say physicists and

9604
03:09:59,389 --> 03:09:59,399
mathematics I would say physicists and
 

9605
03:09:59,399 --> 03:10:01,610
mathematics I would say physicists and
chemists are better they have they

9606
03:10:01,610 --> 03:10:01,620
chemists are better they have they
 

9607
03:10:01,620 --> 03:10:03,050
chemists are better they have they
actually have better sort of ethical

9608
03:10:03,050 --> 03:10:03,060
actually have better sort of ethical
 

9609
03:10:03,060 --> 03:10:04,849
actually have better sort of ethical
rules and so on special biologists like

9610
03:10:04,849 --> 03:10:04,859
rules and so on special biologists like
 

9611
03:10:04,859 --> 03:10:06,769
rules and so on special biologists like
because I think in part it's because

9612
03:10:06,769 --> 03:10:06,779
because I think in part it's because
 

9613
03:10:06,779 --> 03:10:08,150
because I think in part it's because
there is much more money involved

9614
03:10:08,150 --> 03:10:08,160
there is much more money involved
 

9615
03:10:08,160 --> 03:10:09,950
there is much more money involved
because they have to get grants and so

9616
03:10:09,950 --> 03:10:09,960
because they have to get grants and so
 

9617
03:10:09,960 --> 03:10:11,510
because they have to get grants and so
on so for them the question of priority

9618
03:10:11,510 --> 03:10:11,520
on so for them the question of priority
 

9619
03:10:11,520 --> 03:10:13,309
on so for them the question of priority
who discovered what first is much more

9620
03:10:13,309 --> 03:10:13,319
who discovered what first is much more
 

9621
03:10:13,319 --> 03:10:14,809
who discovered what first is much more
serious because there's really some

9622
03:10:14,809 --> 03:10:14,819
serious because there's really some
 

9623
03:10:14,819 --> 03:10:17,090
serious because there's really some
serious money mathematics who cares you

9624
03:10:17,090 --> 03:10:17,100
serious money mathematics who cares you
 

9625

know that Famous Last Theorem was proved

9626
03:10:18,530 --> 03:10:18,540
know that Famous Last Theorem was proved
 

9627
03:10:18,540 --> 03:10:20,269

yeah did Andrew Wells become a

9628
03:10:20,269 --> 03:10:20,279
yeah did Andrew Wells become a
 

9629
03:10:20,279 --> 03:10:23,269
yeah did Andrew Wells become a
millionaire no I think they won the

9630
03:10:23,269 --> 03:10:23,279
millionaire no I think they won the
 

9631
03:10:23,279 --> 03:10:27,110
millionaire no I think they won the
prize but those prices are not I think

9632
03:10:27,110 --> 03:10:27,120
prize but those prices are not I think
 

9633
03:10:27,120 --> 03:10:29,150
prize but those prices are not I think
that one was a big price but uh but in

9634
03:10:29,150 --> 03:10:29,160
that one was a big price but uh but in
 

9635
03:10:29,160 --> 03:10:30,590
that one was a big price but uh but in
general there's not going to keep I

9636
03:10:30,590 --> 03:10:30,600
general there's not going to keep I
 

9637
03:10:30,600 --> 03:10:32,150
general there's not going to keep I
think he won the Apple price eventually

9638
03:10:32,150 --> 03:10:32,160
think he won the Apple price eventually
 

9639
03:10:32,160 --> 03:10:35,269
think he won the Apple price eventually
which is about a million dollars so but

9640
03:10:35,269 --> 03:10:35,279
which is about a million dollars so but
 

9641
03:10:35,279 --> 03:10:38,269
which is about a million dollars so but
you know I sometimes I joke about this

9642
03:10:38,269 --> 03:10:38,279
you know I sometimes I joke about this
 

9643
03:10:38,279 --> 03:10:40,130
you know I sometimes I joke about this
that this is the hardest way to win a

9644
03:10:40,130 --> 03:10:40,140
that this is the hardest way to win a
 

9645
03:10:40,140 --> 03:10:42,250
that this is the hardest way to win a
million dollars

9646
03:10:42,250 --> 03:10:42,260
million dollars
 

9647
03:10:42,260 --> 03:10:44,830
million dollars
so you know

9648
03:10:44,830 --> 03:10:44,840
so you know
 

9649
03:10:44,840 --> 03:10:47,929
so you know
but amongst mathematicians I think the

9650
03:10:47,929 --> 03:10:47,939
but amongst mathematicians I think the
 

9651
03:10:47,939 --> 03:10:52,750
but amongst mathematicians I think the
trouble is that we are so insulated

9652
03:10:52,750 --> 03:10:52,760
trouble is that we are so insulated
 

9653
03:10:52,760 --> 03:10:56,389
trouble is that we are so insulated
from a society because it's such a pure

9654
03:10:56,389 --> 03:10:56,399
from a society because it's such a pure
 

9655
03:10:56,399 --> 03:10:59,929
from a society because it's such a pure
subject it draws in very specific uh

9656
03:10:59,929 --> 03:10:59,939
subject it draws in very specific uh
 

9657
03:10:59,939 --> 03:11:02,269
subject it draws in very specific uh
psychological types and I can speak

9658
03:11:02,269 --> 03:11:02,279
psychological types and I can speak
 

9659
03:11:02,279 --> 03:11:04,550
psychological types and I can speak
about myself I did not realize it at the

9660
03:11:04,550 --> 03:11:04,560
about myself I did not realize it at the
 

9661
03:11:04,560 --> 03:11:07,429
about myself I did not realize it at the
time but later on I definitely saw I

9662
03:11:07,429 --> 03:11:07,439
time but later on I definitely saw I
 

9663
03:11:07,439 --> 03:11:09,769
time but later on I definitely saw I
mentioned some of it earlier that for me

9664
03:11:09,769 --> 03:11:09,779
mentioned some of it earlier that for me
 

9665
03:11:09,779 --> 03:11:12,230
mentioned some of it earlier that for me
mathemax was a refuge from the cruelty

which I described in my book as well but

9676
03:11:23,030 --> 03:11:23,040
which I described in my book as well but
 

9677
03:11:23,040 --> 03:11:25,790
which I described in my book as well but
um that was my way I was like I don't

trust this world I don't want to deal
with it

9682
03:11:28,910 --> 03:11:28,920
with it

I want to hide in this platonic reality

9684
03:11:31,610 --> 03:11:31,620
I want to hide in this platonic reality
 

9685
03:11:31,620 --> 03:11:33,710
I want to hide in this platonic reality
of pure forms

9686
03:11:33,710 --> 03:11:33,720
of pure forms
 

9687
03:11:33,720 --> 03:11:37,070
of pure forms
this is where I know how to operate I

9688
03:11:37,070 --> 03:11:37,080
this is where I know how to operate I
 

9689
03:11:37,080 --> 03:11:39,590
this is where I know how to operate I
love this and and I couldn't be bothered

9690
03:11:39,590 --> 03:11:39,600
love this and and I couldn't be bothered
 

9691
03:11:39,600 --> 03:11:41,809
love this and and I couldn't be bothered
in some sense for a while it happened up

9692
03:11:41,809 --> 03:11:41,819
in some sense for a while it happened up
 

9693
03:11:41,819 --> 03:11:44,570
in some sense for a while it happened up
to a point as as I was getting older and

9694
03:11:44,570 --> 03:11:44,580
to a point as as I was getting older and
 

9695
03:11:44,580 --> 03:11:46,190
to a point as as I was getting older and
more mature I was becoming more and more

9696
03:11:46,190 --> 03:11:46,200
more mature I was becoming more and more

interested in other things
 

9699
03:11:48,779 --> 03:11:50,570
interested in other things
but I think that's one of the reasons

9700
03:11:50,570 --> 03:11:50,580
but I think that's one of the reasons
 

9701
03:11:50,580 --> 03:11:52,910
but I think that's one of the reasons
and one of them

9702
03:11:52,910 --> 03:11:52,920
and one of them
 

9703
03:11:52,920 --> 03:11:55,790
and one of them
reasons why I wrote Love and math

9704
03:11:55,790 --> 03:11:55,800
reasons why I wrote Love and math
 

9705
03:11:55,800 --> 03:11:58,429
reasons why I wrote Love and math
was precisely to break that cycle

that it's it's the quiet guy in the
 

9709
03:12:00,660 --> 03:12:03,590
that it's it's the quiet guy in the
corner that goes into math and not the

9862
03:15:05,330 --> 03:15:05,340
of mathematics that's certainly not
 

9863
03:15:05,340 --> 03:15:07,490
of mathematics that's certainly not
something that is automatic you know

9864
03:15:07,490 --> 03:15:07,500
something that is automatic you know
 

9865

9869
03:15:10,680 --> 03:15:13,010
don't and I'm not saying it is Superior
or inferior it's just how my composition

9870
03:15:13,010 --> 03:15:13,020
or inferior it's just how my composition
 

9871
03:15:13,020 --> 03:15:15,349
or inferior it's just how my composition
my psychological composition is like

9877
03:15:19,080 --> 03:15:20,450

03:15:20,450 --> 03:15:20,460
it's an interesting question like what
 

9879
03:15:20,460 --> 03:15:23,870
it's an interesting question like what
is the cause of it so I think that

03:15:31,680 --> 03:15:32,590
life experiences are
um

9888
03:15:32,590 --> 03:15:32,600
um
 

9889
03:15:32,600 --> 03:15:36,410
um
upbringing family like I was you know I

9890
03:15:36,410 --> 03:15:36,420
upbringing family like I was you know I
 

9891
03:15:36,420 --> 03:15:38,690
upbringing family like I was you know I
was surrounded by Love by my parents on

9892
03:15:38,690 --> 03:15:38,700
was surrounded by Love by my parents on
 

9893
03:15:38,700 --> 03:15:40,550
was surrounded by Love by my parents on
the one hand but in the one on the other

9894
03:15:40,550 --> 03:15:40,560
the one hand but in the one on the other
 

9895
03:15:40,560 --> 03:15:42,950
the one hand but in the one on the other
side uh perhaps they were a little

9896
03:15:42,950 --> 03:15:42,960
side uh perhaps they were a little
 

9897
03:15:42,960 --> 03:15:45,410
side uh perhaps they were a little
overprotective of me so I was kind of

9898
03:15:45,410 --> 03:15:45,420
overprotective of me so I was kind of
 

9899
03:15:45,420 --> 03:15:46,190
overprotective of me so I was kind of
like

9900
03:15:46,190 --> 03:15:46,200
like
 

9901
03:15:46,200 --> 03:15:48,530
like
you know

9902
03:15:48,530 --> 03:15:48,540
you know
 

9903
03:15:48,540 --> 03:15:51,290
you know
um too much kind of like taking care of

9904
03:15:51,290 --> 03:15:51,300
um too much kind of like taking care of
 

9905
03:15:51,300 --> 03:15:52,870
um too much kind of like taking care of
so then when I

9906
03:15:52,870 --> 03:15:52,880
so then when I
 

9907
03:15:52,880 --> 03:15:55,670
so then when I
had it develop certain sensitivity but

9908
03:15:55,670 --> 03:15:55,680
had it develop certain sensitivity but
 

9909
03:15:55,680 --> 03:15:57,950
had it develop certain sensitivity but
it was kind of not ready for the

9910
03:15:57,950 --> 03:15:57,960
it was kind of not ready for the
 

9911
03:15:57,960 --> 03:15:59,809
it was kind of not ready for the
challenges the real world of the real

9912
03:15:59,809 --> 03:15:59,819
challenges the real world of the real
 

9913
03:15:59,819 --> 03:16:02,870
challenges the real world of the real
world so then that struggle and that and

9914
03:16:02,870 --> 03:16:02,880
world so then that struggle and that and
 

9915
03:16:02,880 --> 03:16:04,610
world so then that struggle and that and
then being lost

9916
03:16:04,610 --> 03:16:04,620
then being lost
 

9917
03:16:04,620 --> 03:16:06,830
then being lost
and then being able to overcome and to

9918
03:16:06,830 --> 03:16:06,840
and then being able to overcome and to
 

9919
03:16:06,840 --> 03:16:10,910
and then being able to overcome and to
learn and then if you do in Universe if

9920
03:16:10,910 --> 03:16:10,920
learn and then if you do in Universe if
 

9921
03:16:10,920 --> 03:16:13,309
learn and then if you do in Universe if
you don't lose you don't appreciate

9922
03:16:13,309 --> 03:16:13,319
you don't lose you don't appreciate
 

9923
03:16:13,319 --> 03:16:16,490
you don't lose you don't appreciate
maybe but sometimes when we lose

9924
03:16:16,490 --> 03:16:16,500
maybe but sometimes when we lose
 

9925
03:16:16,500 --> 03:16:18,530
maybe but sometimes when we lose
something and then regain it then we

9926
03:16:18,530 --> 03:16:18,540
something and then regain it then we
 

9927
03:16:18,540 --> 03:16:20,210
something and then regain it then we
cherish it we appreciate and then become

9928
03:16:20,210 --> 03:16:20,220
cherish it we appreciate and then become
 

9929
03:16:20,220 --> 03:16:24,349
cherish it we appreciate and then become
something important also uh various

9930
03:16:24,349 --> 03:16:24,359
something important also uh various
 

9931
03:16:24,359 --> 03:16:27,290
something important also uh various
um difficulties you know the upsetting

9932
03:16:27,290 --> 03:16:27,300
um difficulties you know the upsetting
 

9933
03:16:27,300 --> 03:16:29,809
um difficulties you know the upsetting
experiences or one could say traumatic

9934
03:16:29,809 --> 03:16:29,819
experiences or one could say traumatic
 

9935
03:16:29,819 --> 03:16:31,130
experiences or one could say traumatic
experiences

9936
03:16:31,130 --> 03:16:31,140
experiences
 

9937
03:16:31,140 --> 03:16:33,050
experiences
growing up you know in the Soviet Union

9938
03:16:33,050 --> 03:16:33,060
growing up you know in the Soviet Union
 

9939
03:16:33,060 --> 03:16:36,290
growing up you know in the Soviet Union
that was not uh awoken Park you know it

9940
03:16:36,290 --> 03:16:36,300
that was not uh awoken Park you know it
 

9941
03:16:36,300 --> 03:16:39,349
that was not uh awoken Park you know it
was there were a lot of issues there

9942
03:16:39,349 --> 03:16:39,359
was there were a lot of issues there
 

9943
03:16:39,359 --> 03:16:42,349
was there were a lot of issues there
um that I had to go through and

9944
03:16:42,349 --> 03:16:42,359
um that I had to go through and
 

9945
03:16:42,359 --> 03:16:45,530
um that I had to go through and
and then it doesn't break you make you

9946
03:16:45,530 --> 03:16:45,540
and then it doesn't break you make you
 

9947
03:16:45,540 --> 03:16:49,870
and then it doesn't break you make you
stronger but in my case

9948
03:16:49,870 --> 03:16:49,880

 

9949
03:16:49,880 --> 03:16:52,849

what happened was that you know

9950
03:16:52,849 --> 03:16:52,859
what happened was that you know
 

9951
03:16:52,859 --> 03:16:54,889
what happened was that you know
some for some of it it took me 30 years

9952
03:16:54,889 --> 03:16:54,899
some for some of it it took me 30 years
 

9953
03:16:54,899 --> 03:16:56,870
some for some of it it took me 30 years
to really come to terms with it and to

9954
03:16:56,870 --> 03:16:56,880
to really come to terms with it and to
 

9955
03:16:56,880 --> 03:16:59,210
to really come to terms with it and to
really understand what happened

9956
03:16:59,210 --> 03:16:59,220
really understand what happened
 

9957
03:16:59,220 --> 03:17:03,650
really understand what happened
he gave me this motivation

9958
03:17:03,650 --> 03:17:03,660

 

9959
03:17:03,660 --> 03:17:06,170

um to to strive to become a

9960
03:17:06,170 --> 03:17:06,180
um to to strive to become a
 

9961
03:17:06,180 --> 03:17:07,490
um to to strive to become a
mathematician which maybe I wouldn't

9962
03:17:07,490 --> 03:17:07,500
mathematician which maybe I wouldn't
 

9963
03:17:07,500 --> 03:17:09,050
mathematician which maybe I wouldn't
have otherwise it charged me

9964
03:17:09,050 --> 03:17:09,060
have otherwise it charged me
 

9965
03:17:09,060 --> 03:17:11,269
have otherwise it charged me
supercharged me I'm talking about for

9966
03:17:11,269 --> 03:17:11,279
supercharged me I'm talking about for
 

9967
03:17:11,279 --> 03:17:13,550
supercharged me I'm talking about for
instance the experience with exam

9968
03:17:13,550 --> 03:17:13,560
instance the experience with exam
 

9969
03:17:13,560 --> 03:17:15,410
instance the experience with exam
at Moscow University can you take me

9970
03:17:15,410 --> 03:17:15,420
at Moscow University can you take me
 

9971
03:17:15,420 --> 03:17:17,809
at Moscow University can you take me
through that experience so

9972
03:17:17,809 --> 03:17:17,819
through that experience so
 

9973
03:17:17,819 --> 03:17:20,630
through that experience so
this is 1984 we spoke about Orwell

9974
03:17:20,630 --> 03:17:20,640
this is 1984 we spoke about Orwell
 

9975
03:17:20,640 --> 03:17:21,710
this is 1984 we spoke about Orwell
earlier

9976
03:17:21,710 --> 03:17:21,720
earlier
 

9977
03:17:21,720 --> 03:17:23,389
earlier
and

9978
03:17:23,389 --> 03:17:23,399
and
 

9979
03:17:23,399 --> 03:17:26,950
and
I was applying to Moscow University

9980
03:17:26,950 --> 03:17:26,960
I was applying to Moscow University
 

9981
03:17:26,960 --> 03:17:29,210
I was applying to Moscow University
mathematics Department it's called

9982
03:17:29,210 --> 03:17:29,220
mathematics Department it's called
 

9983
03:17:29,220 --> 03:17:32,090

don't know like the place was the only
 

9987
03:17:34,680 --> 03:17:35,990
don't know like the place was the only
place to study pure mathematics in

9988
03:17:35,990 --> 03:17:36,000
place to study pure mathematics in
 

9989
03:17:36,000 --> 03:17:38,210
place to study pure mathematics in
Moscow period but also but also

9990
03:17:38,210 --> 03:17:38,220
Moscow period but also but also
 

9991
03:17:38,220 --> 03:17:40,429

Moscow University
 

9999
03:17:48,720 --> 03:17:52,670
Moscow University
so because as I said you know a year

10000
03:17:52,670 --> 03:17:52,680
so because as I said you know a year
 

10001
03:17:52,680 --> 03:17:54,889
so because as I said you know a year
earlier evgenie evgeny which converted

10002
03:17:54,889 --> 03:17:54,899
earlier evgenie evgeny which converted
 

10003
03:17:54,899 --> 03:17:57,590
earlier evgenie evgeny which converted
me into math capitalizing on my love for

10004
03:17:57,590 --> 03:17:57,600
me into math capitalizing on my love for
 

10005
03:17:57,600 --> 03:18:00,170
me into math capitalizing on my love for
physical quantum physics and so we I

10006
03:18:00,170 --> 03:18:00,180
physical quantum physics and so we I
 

10007
03:18:00,180 --> 03:18:01,969
physical quantum physics and so we I
spent a whole year studying with him and

10008
03:18:01,969 --> 03:18:01,979
spent a whole year studying with him and
 

10009
03:18:01,979 --> 03:18:04,250
spent a whole year studying with him and
I was already kind of at the level of

10010
03:18:04,250 --> 03:18:04,260
I was already kind of at the level of
 

10011
03:18:04,260 --> 03:18:06,830
I was already kind of at the level of
you know and some in some subjects a

10012
03:18:06,830 --> 03:18:06,840
you know and some in some subjects a
 

10013

so it seemed like it would be a breeze

10018
03:18:12,950 --> 03:18:12,960
so it seemed like it would be a breeze
 

10019
03:18:12,960 --> 03:18:15,769
so it seemed like it would be a breeze
to go to get into Moscow University

10020
03:18:15,769 --> 03:18:15,779
to go to get into Moscow University
 

10021
03:18:15,779 --> 03:18:19,309
to go to get into Moscow University
but in fact little did I know that uh

10022
03:18:19,309 --> 03:18:19,319
but in fact little did I know that uh
 

10023
03:18:19,319 --> 03:18:22,010
but in fact little did I know that uh
there was a

10024
03:18:22,010 --> 03:18:22,020
there was a
 

10025
03:18:22,020 --> 03:18:25,309
there was a
a policy of anti-Semitism where students

10026
03:18:25,309 --> 03:18:25,319
a policy of anti-Semitism where students
 

10027
03:18:25,319 --> 03:18:27,469
a policy of anti-Semitism where students
like me would be failed by special

10028
03:18:27,469 --> 03:18:27,479
like me would be failed by special
 

10029
03:18:27,479 --> 03:18:29,030
like me would be failed by special
examiners

10030

mostly during the oral exam with
 

10033
03:18:30,899 --> 03:18:33,170
mostly during the oral exam with
mathematics but

03:18:48,650 --> 03:18:48,660
and but I was since my last name was my
 

10049
03:18:48,660 --> 03:18:51,050
and but I was since my last name was my
father's name so it was very easy too

10050
03:18:51,050 --> 03:18:51,060
father's name so it was very easy too
 

10051
03:18:51,060 --> 03:18:54,050
father's name so it was very easy too
to read what my nationality was

10052
03:18:54,050 --> 03:18:54,060
to read what my nationality was
 

10053

and so there was this can you imagine
 

10055
03:18:56,460 --> 03:18:57,769
and so there was this can you imagine
there were special people who would

10056
03:18:57,769 --> 03:18:57,779
there were special people who would
 

10057
03:18:57,779 --> 03:19:00,469
there were special people who would
screen up applicants who would put aside

10058
03:19:00,469 --> 03:19:00,479
screen up applicants who would put aside
 

10059
03:19:00,479 --> 03:19:03,769
screen up applicants who would put aside
the files of the undesirables there

10060
03:19:03,769 --> 03:19:03,779
the files of the undesirables there
 

10061
03:19:03,779 --> 03:19:05,269
the files of the undesirables there
would be special examiners who were

10062
03:19:05,269 --> 03:19:05,279
would be special examiners who were
 

10063
03:19:05,279 --> 03:19:07,730
would be special examiners who were
actually professors at this University

10064
03:19:07,730 --> 03:19:07,740
actually professors at this University
 

10065
03:19:07,740 --> 03:19:11,389
actually professors at this University
who would be designated as

10066
03:19:11,389 --> 03:19:11,399
who would be designated as
 

10067
03:19:11,399 --> 03:19:13,570
who would be designated as
those who would take the exam from those

10068
03:19:13,570 --> 03:19:13,580
those who would take the exam from those
 

10069
03:19:13,580 --> 03:19:16,309
those who would take the exam from those
undesirables it was it's almost comical

10070
03:19:16,309 --> 03:19:16,319
undesirables it was it's almost comical
 

10071
03:19:16,319 --> 03:19:18,469
undesirables it was it's almost comical
when you look back now and also like

10072
03:19:18,469 --> 03:19:18,479
when you look back now and also like
 

10073
03:19:18,479 --> 03:19:20,990
when you look back now and also like
questions why there was no reason other

10074
03:19:20,990 --> 03:19:21,000
questions why there was no reason other
 

10075
03:19:21,000 --> 03:19:23,150
questions why there was no reason other
than just hatred of the other that's how

10076
03:19:23,150 --> 03:19:23,160
than just hatred of the other that's how
 

10077
03:19:23,160 --> 03:19:24,769
than just hatred of the other that's how
I see it and just to give a little bit

10078
03:19:24,769 --> 03:19:24,779
I see it and just to give a little bit
 

10079
03:19:24,779 --> 03:19:26,990
I see it and just to give a little bit
more color so

10080
03:19:26,990 --> 03:19:27,000
more color so
 

10081
03:19:27,000 --> 03:19:28,849
more color so
uh because you mentioned nationality

10082
03:19:28,849 --> 03:19:28,859
uh because you mentioned nationality
 

10083
03:19:28,859 --> 03:19:31,910
uh because you mentioned nationality
it's a little uh Quark that perhaps

10084
03:19:31,910 --> 03:19:31,920
it's a little uh Quark that perhaps
 

10085
03:19:31,920 --> 03:19:33,590
it's a little uh Quark that perhaps
gives an inside to the bigger system

10086
03:19:33,590 --> 03:19:33,600
gives an inside to the bigger system
 

10087
03:19:33,600 --> 03:19:35,870
gives an inside to the bigger system
that the nationality listed on your

10088
03:19:35,870 --> 03:19:35,880

03:21:45,300 --> 03:21:48,230
inviting me as a visiting Professor to
Harvard I was 21 I was barely 21 because

10206
03:21:48,230 --> 03:21:48,240
Harvard I was 21 I was barely 21 because
 

10207
03:21:48,240 --> 03:21:50,450
Harvard I was 21 I was barely 21 because
I already did some research in the

10208
03:21:50,450 --> 03:21:50,460
I already did some research in the
 

10209
03:21:50,460 --> 03:21:54,110
I already did some research in the
meantime that's how motivated I was you

10210
03:21:54,110 --> 03:21:54,120
meantime that's how motivated I was you
 

10211
03:21:54,120 --> 03:21:56,690
meantime that's how motivated I was you
know so but the interesting aspect of it

10212
03:21:56,690 --> 03:21:56,700
know so but the interesting aspect of it
 

10213
03:21:56,700 --> 03:22:00,370
know so but the interesting aspect of it
is that for for the longest time

10214
03:22:00,370 --> 03:22:00,380
is that for for the longest time
 

10215
03:22:00,380 --> 03:22:03,349
is that for for the longest time
afterwards I was telling myself a story

10216
03:22:03,349 --> 03:22:03,359
afterwards I was telling myself a story
 

10217
03:22:03,359 --> 03:22:05,929
afterwards I was telling myself a story
that nothing really happened

10218
03:22:05,929 --> 03:22:05,939
that nothing really happened
 

10219
03:22:05,939 --> 03:22:08,450
that nothing really happened
it wasn't so bad okay so I was failed

10220
03:22:08,450 --> 03:22:08,460
it wasn't so bad okay so I was failed
 

10221
03:22:08,460 --> 03:22:13,429
it wasn't so bad okay so I was failed
but I knew that I was going to succeed

10222
03:22:13,429 --> 03:22:13,439
but I knew that I was going to succeed
 

10223
03:22:13,439 --> 03:22:15,650
but I knew that I was going to succeed
it was 30 years later

10224
03:22:15,650 --> 03:22:15,660
it was 30 years later
 

10225
03:22:15,660 --> 03:22:17,750
it was 30 years later
that I finally

10226
03:22:17,750 --> 03:22:17,760
that I finally
 

10227
03:22:17,760 --> 03:22:20,090
that I finally
got to meet that boy that 16 year old

10228
03:22:20,090 --> 03:22:20,100
got to meet that boy that 16 year old
 

10229
03:22:20,100 --> 03:22:21,950
got to meet that boy that 16 year old
that I

10230
03:22:21,950 --> 03:22:21,960
that I
 

10231
03:22:21,960 --> 03:22:24,710
that I
that I neglected this time and I

10232
03:22:24,710 --> 03:22:24,720
that I neglected this time and I
 

10233
03:22:24,720 --> 03:22:27,410
that I neglected this time and I
realized that he died that it was a

10234
03:22:27,410 --> 03:22:27,420
realized that he died that it was a
 

10235
03:22:27,420 --> 03:22:30,349
realized that he died that it was a
crushing blow the Innocence not just

10236
03:22:30,349 --> 03:22:30,359
crushing blow the Innocence not just
 

10237
03:22:30,359 --> 03:22:33,050
crushing blow the Innocence not just
instance because there was no way it

10238
03:22:33,050 --> 03:22:33,060
instance because there was no way it
 

10239
03:22:33,060 --> 03:22:34,250
instance because there was no way it
looked like there was no way I could

10240
03:22:34,250 --> 03:22:34,260
looked like there was no way I could
 

10241
03:22:34,260 --> 03:22:35,990
looked like there was no way I could
become a mathematician because if I

10242
03:22:35,990 --> 03:22:36,000
become a mathematician because if I
 

10243
03:22:36,000 --> 03:22:38,570
become a mathematician because if I
don't if you don't accept me there

10244
03:22:38,570 --> 03:22:38,580
don't if you don't accept me there
 

10245
03:22:38,580 --> 03:22:40,010
don't if you don't accept me there
it's over

10246
03:22:40,010 --> 03:22:40,020
it's over
 

10247
03:22:40,020 --> 03:22:43,190
it's over
I didn't know that I could actually find

10248
03:22:43,190 --> 03:22:43,200
I didn't know that I could actually find
 

10249
03:22:43,200 --> 03:22:46,670
I didn't know that I could actually find
this striving applied math program and

10250
03:22:46,670 --> 03:22:46,680
this striving applied math program and
 

10251
03:22:46,680 --> 03:22:47,929
this striving applied math program and
then eventually somebody would take me

10252
03:22:47,929 --> 03:22:47,939
then eventually somebody would take me
 

10253
03:22:47,939 --> 03:22:49,910
then eventually somebody would take me
under his wing and so on and then could

10254
03:22:49,910 --> 03:22:49,920
under his wing and so on and then could
 

10255
03:22:49,920 --> 03:22:52,370
under his wing and so on and then could
move to the United States this was not

10256
03:22:52,370 --> 03:22:52,380
move to the United States this was not
 

10257
03:22:52,380 --> 03:22:54,170
move to the United States this was not
in the realm of possibilities

10258
03:22:54,170 --> 03:22:54,180
in the realm of possibilities
 

10259
03:22:54,180 --> 03:22:55,490
in the realm of possibilities
so in other words I could there was

10260
03:22:55,490 --> 03:22:55,500
so in other words I could there was
 

10261
03:22:55,500 --> 03:22:57,230
so in other words I could there was
nothing to look forward to

10262
03:22:57,230 --> 03:22:57,240
nothing to look forward to
 

10263
03:22:57,240 --> 03:23:01,730
nothing to look forward to
it was clear that it's over I cannot

10264
03:23:01,730 --> 03:23:01,740

 

10265
03:23:01,740 --> 03:23:04,849

I cannot do what I love

10266
03:23:04,849 --> 03:23:04,859
I cannot do what I love
 

10267
03:23:04,859 --> 03:23:08,630
I cannot do what I love
and so when I finally

10268
03:23:08,630 --> 03:23:08,640
and so when I finally
 

10269
03:23:08,640 --> 03:23:11,750
and so when I finally
when I finally connected to that boy oh

10270
03:23:11,750 --> 03:23:11,760
when I finally connected to that boy oh
 

10271
03:23:11,760 --> 03:23:13,849
when I finally connected to that boy oh
my God that was a totally different

10272
03:23:13,849 --> 03:23:13,859
my God that was a totally different
 

10273
03:23:13,859 --> 03:23:16,070
my God that was a totally different
experience all the pain and all the

10274
03:23:16,070 --> 03:23:16,080
experience all the pain and all the
 

10275
03:23:16,080 --> 03:23:20,570
experience all the pain and all the
trauma came to the surface and it was

10276
03:23:20,570 --> 03:23:20,580
trauma came to the surface and it was
 

10277
03:23:20,580 --> 03:23:22,550
trauma came to the surface and it was
a kind of a tsunami

10278
03:23:22,550 --> 03:23:22,560
a kind of a tsunami
 

10279
03:23:22,560 --> 03:23:24,530
a kind of a tsunami
I didn't I wasn't sure I would survive

10280
03:23:24,530 --> 03:23:24,540
I didn't I wasn't sure I would survive
 

10281
03:23:24,540 --> 03:23:26,750
I didn't I wasn't sure I would survive
this so it was so hard

10282
03:23:26,750 --> 03:23:26,760
this so it was so hard
 

10283
03:23:26,760 --> 03:23:29,990
this so it was so hard
and what happened was I was invited to

10284
03:23:29,990 --> 03:23:30,000
and what happened was I was invited to
 

10285
03:23:30,000 --> 03:23:32,990
and what happened was I was invited to
to give a talk about this in New York

10286
03:23:32,990 --> 03:23:33,000
to give a talk about this in New York
 

10287
03:23:33,000 --> 03:23:35,630
to give a talk about this in New York
it was kind of a spoken word event

10288
03:23:35,630 --> 03:23:35,640
it was kind of a spoken word event
 

10289
03:23:35,640 --> 03:23:37,910
it was kind of a spoken word event
uh about science but like personal

10290
03:23:37,910 --> 03:23:37,920
uh about science but like personal
 

10291
03:23:37,920 --> 03:23:40,190
uh about science but like personal
experiences related to science this was

10292
03:23:40,190 --> 03:23:40,200
experiences related to science this was
 

10293
03:23:40,200 --> 03:23:41,929
experiences related to science this was
almost a year after

10294
03:23:41,929 --> 03:23:41,939
almost a year after
 

10295
03:23:41,939 --> 03:23:43,670
almost a year after
my book came out

10296
03:23:43,670 --> 03:23:43,680
my book came out
 

10297
03:23:43,680 --> 03:23:45,290
my book came out
in my book

10298
03:23:45,290 --> 03:23:45,300
in my book
 

10299
03:23:45,300 --> 03:23:47,570
in my book
one of the first chapters is a chapter

10300
03:23:47,570 --> 03:23:47,580
one of the first chapters is a chapter
 

10301
03:23:47,580 --> 03:23:49,670
one of the first chapters is a chapter
about this experience

10302
03:23:49,670 --> 03:23:49,680
about this experience
 

10303
03:23:49,680 --> 03:23:51,950
about this experience
but what I realized now is that I wrote

10304
03:23:51,950 --> 03:23:51,960
but what I realized now is that I wrote
 

10305
03:23:51,960 --> 03:23:53,990
but what I realized now is that I wrote
it from the third person perspective

10306
03:23:53,990 --> 03:23:54,000
it from the third person perspective
 

10307
03:23:54,000 --> 03:23:55,849
it from the third person perspective
I knew the facts

10308
03:23:55,849 --> 03:23:55,859
I knew the facts
 

10309
03:23:55,859 --> 03:23:57,530
I knew the facts
but I was not emotionally connected to

10310
03:23:57,530 --> 03:23:57,540
but I was not emotionally connected to
 

10311
03:23:57,540 --> 03:23:59,150
but I was not emotionally connected to
that experience however

10312
03:23:59,150 --> 03:23:59,160
that experience however
 

10313
03:23:59,160 --> 03:24:01,010
that experience however
since I wanted to write the book and to

10314
03:24:01,010 --> 03:24:01,020
since I wanted to write the book and to
 

10315
03:24:01,020 --> 03:24:03,530
since I wanted to write the book and to
connect to my readers I allowed the boy

10316
03:24:03,530 --> 03:24:03,540
connect to my readers I allowed the boy
 

10317
03:24:03,540 --> 03:24:05,690
connect to my readers I allowed the boy
to write it

10318
03:24:05,690 --> 03:24:05,700
to write it
 

10319
03:24:05,700 --> 03:24:07,250
to write it
so a lot of people were touched by it

10320
03:24:07,250 --> 03:24:07,260
so a lot of people were touched by it
 

10321
03:24:07,260 --> 03:24:09,889
so a lot of people were touched by it
and they would people would say wow that

10322
03:24:09,889 --> 03:24:09,899
and they would people would say wow that
 

10323
03:24:09,899 --> 03:24:11,570
and they would people would say wow that
chapter you know it really got a lot of

10324
03:24:11,570 --> 03:24:11,580
chapter you know it really got a lot of
 

10325
03:24:11,580 --> 03:24:13,550
chapter you know it really got a lot of
resonance it was translated into other

10326
03:24:13,550 --> 03:24:13,560
resonance it was translated into other
 

10327
03:24:13,560 --> 03:24:14,750
resonance it was translated into other
language even before the book was

10328
03:24:14,750 --> 03:24:14,760
language even before the book was
 

10329
03:24:14,760 --> 03:24:16,190
language even before the book was
published

10330
03:24:16,190 --> 03:24:16,200
published
 

10331
03:24:16,200 --> 03:24:18,889
published
I was surprised by this because I didn't

10332
03:24:18,889 --> 03:24:18,899
I was surprised by this because I didn't
 

10333
03:24:18,899 --> 03:24:22,010
I was surprised by this because I didn't
know yet so the adult Edward was not yet

10334
03:24:22,010 --> 03:24:22,020
know yet so the adult Edward was not yet
 

10335
03:24:22,020 --> 03:24:25,849
know yet so the adult Edward was not yet
in touch but the book gave the outlet

10336
03:24:25,849 --> 03:24:25,859
in touch but the book gave the outlet
 

10337
03:24:25,859 --> 03:24:27,590
in touch but the book gave the outlet
to the child

10338
03:24:27,590 --> 03:24:27,600
to the child
 

10339
03:24:27,600 --> 03:24:28,910
to the child
so

10340
03:24:28,910 --> 03:24:28,920
so
 

10341
03:24:28,920 --> 03:24:30,650
so
and that kind of

10342
03:24:30,650 --> 03:24:30,660
and that kind of
 

10343
03:24:30,660 --> 03:24:32,330
and that kind of
started the process

10344
03:24:32,330 --> 03:24:32,340
started the process
 

10345
03:24:32,340 --> 03:24:33,950
started the process
so finally

10346
03:24:33,950 --> 03:24:33,960
so finally
 

10347
03:24:33,960 --> 03:24:34,610
so finally
um

10348
03:24:34,610 --> 03:24:34,620
um
 

10349
03:24:34,620 --> 03:24:38,030
um
almost a year later I'm in New York in

10350
03:24:38,030 --> 03:24:38,040
almost a year later I'm in New York in
 

10351
03:24:38,040 --> 03:24:39,050
almost a year later I'm in New York in
this

10352
03:24:39,050 --> 03:24:39,060
this
 

10353
03:24:39,060 --> 03:24:42,349
this
at this event and the night before

at this event and the night before
 

10355
03:24:42,359 --> 03:24:44,690
at this event and the night before
I'm in my hotel room and I was like okay

10356
03:24:44,690 --> 03:24:44,700
I'm in my hotel room and I was like okay
 

10357

but by that time I already had an
 

10377
03:25:06,000 --> 03:25:08,929
but by that time I already had an
Insight that it's possible to have that

10378

Insight that it's possible to have that

10385
03:25:15,960 --> 03:25:17,929
quickly there was someone in my life who
explained to me this idea that

explained to me this idea that
 

10387
03:25:17,939 --> 03:25:19,790
explained to me this idea that
some things are under the radar of

10388
03:25:19,790 --> 03:25:19,800
some things are under the radar of
 

10389
03:25:19,800 --> 03:25:22,370
some things are under the radar of
awareness but they may still influence

10390

03:26:15,849 --> 03:26:15,859
took to build that
 

10439
03:26:15,859 --> 03:26:18,469
took to build that
in Russian you know that that hardcore

10440

moments when it could come out

10446
03:26:26,269 --> 03:26:26,279
moments when it could come out
 

10447
03:26:26,279 --> 03:26:29,389
moments when it could come out
and for instance I developed this fear

and for instance I developed this fear
 

10449
03:26:29,399 --> 03:26:31,610
and for instance I developed this fear
of public speaking and all kinds of

10450
03:26:31,610 --> 03:26:31,620
of public speaking and all kinds of
 

10451
03:26:31,620 --> 03:26:34,130
of public speaking and all kinds of
little things that I now feel were

little things that I now feel were
 

10453
03:26:34,140 --> 03:26:37,429
little things that I now feel were
connected so anyway I saw what happened

how difficult it was how crushed he was

we are doing okay
and it's kind of almost just like

10518
03:27:54,830 --> 03:27:54,840
and it's kind of almost just like
 

10519
03:27:54,840 --> 03:27:56,450
and it's kind of almost just like
holding

10520
03:27:56,450 --> 03:27:56,460

10529
03:28:08,040 --> 03:28:09,469
feeling it so
the next day

10530
03:28:09,469 --> 03:28:09,479
the next day
 

10531
03:28:09,479 --> 03:28:11,809
the next day
I went to the microphone and I let him

10532
03:28:11,809 --> 03:28:11,819
I went to the microphone and I let him
 

10533
03:28:11,819 --> 03:28:14,030
I went to the microphone and I let him
speak for the first time

10534
03:28:14,030 --> 03:28:14,040
speak for the first time
 

10535
03:28:14,040 --> 03:28:16,910
speak for the first time
about his experience in his own voice

10536
03:28:16,910 --> 03:28:16,920
about his experience in his own voice
 

10537
03:28:16,920 --> 03:28:19,490
about his experience in his own voice
it was incredible people were crying and

10538
03:28:19,490 --> 03:28:19,500
it was incredible people were crying and
 

10539
03:28:19,500 --> 03:28:21,769
it was incredible people were crying and
afterwards came up to me and started

10540
03:28:21,769 --> 03:28:21,779
afterwards came up to me and started
 

10541
03:28:21,779 --> 03:28:23,570
afterwards came up to me and started
sharing stories and so on because it is

10542
03:28:23,570 --> 03:28:23,580
sharing stories and so on because it is
 

10543
03:28:23,580 --> 03:28:25,550
sharing stories and so on because it is
a story it's a universal story it's

10544
03:28:25,550 --> 03:28:25,560
a story it's a universal story it's
 

10545
03:28:25,560 --> 03:28:27,110
a story it's a universal story it's
archetypal story

10546
03:28:27,110 --> 03:28:27,120
archetypal story
 

10547
03:28:27,120 --> 03:28:30,229
archetypal story
it's the story of rejection and

10548
03:28:30,229 --> 03:28:30,239
it's the story of rejection and
 

10549
03:28:30,239 --> 03:28:32,929
it's the story of rejection and
being treated unfairly

10550
03:28:32,929 --> 03:28:32,939
being treated unfairly
 

10551
03:28:32,939 --> 03:28:36,650
being treated unfairly
we all know it and I think it's so

10552
03:28:36,650 --> 03:28:36,660
we all know it and I think it's so
 

10553
03:28:36,660 --> 03:28:39,530
we all know it and I think it's so
important to realize that

10554
03:28:39,530 --> 03:28:39,540
important to realize that
 

10555
03:28:39,540 --> 03:28:41,750
important to realize that
it's so it's possible to revisit those

10556
03:28:41,750 --> 03:28:41,760
it's so it's possible to revisit those
 

10557
03:28:41,760 --> 03:28:44,030
it's so it's possible to revisit those
moments it's possible to reconnect to

10558
03:28:44,030 --> 03:28:44,040
moments it's possible to reconnect to
 

10559
03:28:44,040 --> 03:28:45,710
moments it's possible to reconnect to
our little ones it's possible to bring

10560
03:28:45,710 --> 03:28:45,720
our little ones it's possible to bring
 

10561
03:28:45,720 --> 03:28:47,210
our little ones it's possible to bring
them back

10562
03:28:47,210 --> 03:28:47,220
them back
 

10563
03:28:47,220 --> 03:28:51,170
them back
and we are better for it because this

10564
03:28:51,170 --> 03:28:51,180
and we are better for it because this
 

10565
03:28:51,180 --> 03:28:53,269
and we are better for it because this
changed my life this experience then

10566
03:28:53,269 --> 03:28:53,279
changed my life this experience then
 

10567
03:28:53,279 --> 03:28:54,710
changed my life this experience then
they were then suddenly it's like a

10568
03:28:54,710 --> 03:28:54,720
they were then suddenly it's like a
 

10569
03:28:54,720 --> 03:28:56,269
they were then suddenly it's like a
floodgates there were many other things

10570
03:28:56,269 --> 03:28:56,279
floodgates there were many other things
 

10571
03:28:56,279 --> 03:28:57,889
floodgates there were many other things
that came

10572
03:28:57,889 --> 03:28:57,899
that came
 

10573
03:28:57,899 --> 03:29:00,229
that came
that's when I became

10574
03:29:00,229 --> 03:29:00,239
that's when I became
 

10575
03:29:00,239 --> 03:29:02,150
that's when I became
interested in the dimensions of

10576
03:29:02,150 --> 03:29:02,160
interested in the dimensions of
 

10577
03:29:02,160 --> 03:29:04,370
interested in the dimensions of
imagination and intuition and so on

10578
03:29:04,370 --> 03:29:04,380
imagination and intuition and so on
 

10579
03:29:04,380 --> 03:29:06,650
imagination and intuition and so on
because suddenly I realized that I was

10580
03:29:06,650 --> 03:29:06,660
because suddenly I realized that I was
 

10581
03:29:06,660 --> 03:29:08,870
because suddenly I realized that I was
deprived of those of that possibility of

10582
03:29:08,870 --> 03:29:08,880
deprived of those of that possibility of
 

10583
03:29:08,880 --> 03:29:10,130
deprived of those of that possibility of
looking at the World Through The Eyes of

10584
03:29:10,130 --> 03:29:10,140
looking at the World Through The Eyes of
 

10585
03:29:10,140 --> 03:29:12,410
looking at the World Through The Eyes of
a child because that child was frozen in

10586
03:29:12,410 --> 03:29:12,420
a child because that child was frozen in
 

10587
03:29:12,420 --> 03:29:14,990
a child because that child was frozen in
time it was I was not connected to him

10588
03:29:14,990 --> 03:29:15,000
time it was I was not connected to him
 

10589
03:29:15,000 --> 03:29:18,590
time it was I was not connected to him
but suddenly he's with me and he's like

10590
03:29:18,590 --> 03:29:18,600
but suddenly he's with me and he's like
 

10591
03:29:18,600 --> 03:29:21,290
but suddenly he's with me and he's like

10594
03:29:28,370 --> 03:29:28,380

 

10595
03:29:28,380 --> 03:29:31,010

so

10596
03:29:31,010 --> 03:29:31,020
so
 

10597
03:29:31,020 --> 03:29:33,530
so
if I could ask you

10598
03:29:33,530 --> 03:29:33,540
if I could ask you
 

10599
03:29:33,540 --> 03:29:36,110
if I could ask you
about there's a difficult idea here

10600
03:29:36,110 --> 03:29:36,120
about there's a difficult idea here
 

10601
03:29:36,120 --> 03:29:39,290
about there's a difficult idea here
there's a tension I've interacted with a

10602
03:29:39,290 --> 03:29:39,300
there's a tension I've interacted with a
 

10603
03:29:39,300 --> 03:29:41,450
there's a tension I've interacted with a
few folks in my personal life and in

10604
03:29:41,450 --> 03:29:41,460
few folks in my personal life and in
 

10605
03:29:41,460 --> 03:29:44,630
few folks in my personal life and in
general that have lived through uh this

10606
03:29:44,630 --> 03:29:44,640
general that have lived through uh this
 

10607
03:29:44,640 --> 03:29:47,570
general that have lived through uh this
experience of unfairness and cruelty in

10608
03:29:47,570 --> 03:29:47,580
experience of unfairness and cruelty in
 

10609
03:29:47,580 --> 03:29:49,670
experience of unfairness and cruelty in
the world as young

10610
03:29:49,670 --> 03:29:49,680
the world as young
 

10611
03:29:49,680 --> 03:29:51,889
the world as young
people

10612
03:29:51,889 --> 03:29:51,899
people
 

10613
03:29:51,899 --> 03:29:54,889
people
and

10614
03:29:54,889 --> 03:29:54,899

 

10615
03:29:54,899 --> 03:29:57,889

what wisdom do you draw from

10616
03:29:57,889 --> 03:29:57,899
what wisdom do you draw from
 

10617
03:29:57,899 --> 03:30:01,729
what wisdom do you draw from
the the the the action you took of not

10618
03:30:01,729 --> 03:30:01,739
the the the the action you took of not
 

10619
03:30:01,739 --> 03:30:03,769
the the the the action you took of not
acknowledging that you're a victim to

10620
03:30:03,769 --> 03:30:03,779
acknowledging that you're a victim to
 

10621
03:30:03,779 --> 03:30:05,630
acknowledging that you're a victim to
Cruelty but instead just working your

10622
03:30:05,630 --> 03:30:05,640
Cruelty but instead just working your
 

10623
03:30:05,640 --> 03:30:08,929
Cruelty but instead just working your
ass off working harder

10624
03:30:08,929 --> 03:30:08,939
ass off working harder
 

10625
03:30:08,939 --> 03:30:12,530
ass off working harder
and then this the flip side of that is

10626
03:30:12,530 --> 03:30:12,540
and then this the flip side of that is
 

10627
03:30:12,540 --> 03:30:14,809
and then this the flip side of that is
you eventually reconnecting with the

10628
03:30:14,809 --> 03:30:14,819
you eventually reconnecting with the
 

10629
03:30:14,819 --> 03:30:16,969
you eventually reconnecting with the
cruelty that you experience because if

10630
03:30:16,969 --> 03:30:16,979
cruelty that you experience because if
 

10631
03:30:16,979 --> 03:30:19,190
cruelty that you experience because if
you did that early on I was not ready

10632
03:30:19,190 --> 03:30:19,200
you did that early on I was not ready
 

10633
03:30:19,200 --> 03:30:21,889
you did that early on I was not ready
for it it is a defense mechanism I could

10634
03:30:21,889 --> 03:30:21,899
for it it is a defense mechanism I could
 

10635
03:30:21,899 --> 03:30:23,450
for it it is a defense mechanism I could
be I could have come you know there were

10636
03:30:23,450 --> 03:30:23,460
be I could have come you know there were
 

10637
03:30:23,460 --> 03:30:24,950
be I could have come you know there were
kids who commit suicide after this

10638
03:30:24,950 --> 03:30:24,960
kids who commit suicide after this
 

10639
03:30:24,960 --> 03:30:26,630
kids who commit suicide after this
experience I could have commit suicide

10640
03:30:26,630 --> 03:30:26,640
experience I could have commit suicide
 

10641
03:30:26,640 --> 03:30:28,010
experience I could have commit suicide
because it's too much

10642
03:30:28,010 --> 03:30:28,020
because it's too much
 

10643
03:30:28,020 --> 03:30:30,889
because it's too much
and it is well known afterwards of

10644
03:30:30,889 --> 03:30:30,899
and it is well known afterwards of
 

10645
03:30:30,899 --> 03:30:32,389
and it is well known afterwards of
course I became aware of all the

10646
03:30:32,389 --> 03:30:32,399

literature about childhood trauma and so

10648
03:30:35,630 --> 03:30:35,640
literature about childhood trauma and so
 

10649
03:30:35,640 --> 03:30:38,210
literature about childhood trauma and so
on and I have been I've been speaking

10650
03:30:38,210 --> 03:30:38,220
on and I have been I've been speaking
 

10651
03:30:38,220 --> 03:30:41,750
on and I have been I've been speaking
publicly about it since then too and so

10652
03:30:41,750 --> 03:30:41,760
publicly about it since then too and so
 

10653
03:30:41,760 --> 03:30:44,809
publicly about it since then too and so
you know it is well-known issue and

10654
03:30:44,809 --> 03:30:44,819
you know it is well-known issue and
 

10655

03:30:46,020 --> 03:30:46,910
well-known
um

10658
03:30:46,910 --> 03:30:46,920
um
 

10659
03:30:46,920 --> 03:30:50,750
um
kind of a universal phenomenon I think

10660
03:30:50,750 --> 03:30:50,760
kind of a universal phenomenon I think
 

10661
03:30:50,760 --> 03:30:53,030
kind of a universal phenomenon I think
that interesting enough

10662
03:30:53,030 --> 03:30:53,040
that interesting enough
 

10663
03:30:53,040 --> 03:30:55,610
that interesting enough
even though one now I see a lot of

10664
03:30:55,610 --> 03:30:55,620
even though one now I see a lot of
 

10665
03:30:55,620 --> 03:30:57,769
even though one now I see a lot of
discussion of it now that my eyes are

10666
03:30:57,769 --> 03:30:57,779
discussion of it now that my eyes are
 

10667
03:30:57,779 --> 03:31:00,469
discussion of it now that my eyes are
open but somehow before I didn't see it

10668
03:31:00,469 --> 03:31:00,479
open but somehow before I didn't see it
 

10669
03:31:00,479 --> 03:31:02,929
open but somehow before I didn't see it
so that which also shows you how our

10670
03:31:02,929 --> 03:31:02,939
so that which also shows you how our
 

10671
03:31:02,939 --> 03:31:05,330
so that which also shows you how our
confirmation bias kind of like how we

10672
03:31:05,330 --> 03:31:05,340
confirmation bias kind of like how we
 

10673
03:31:05,340 --> 03:31:07,070
confirmation bias kind of like how we
screen ourselves how we turn the Blind

10674

Eye to things which do not confirm our

03:31:08,809 --> 03:31:08,819
Eye to things which do not confirm our
 

10677
03:31:08,819 --> 03:31:10,490
Eye to things which do not confirm our
views or for which we are not yet ready

03:31:10,490 --> 03:31:10,500
views or for which we are not yet ready
 

10679
03:31:10,500 --> 03:31:12,710

and by the way nobody should push to do

10680
03:31:12,710 --> 03:31:12,720
and by the way nobody should push to do
 

10681
03:31:12,720 --> 03:31:15,769
and by the way nobody should push to do
it too soon I'm glad I I developed

10682
03:31:15,769 --> 03:31:15,779
it too soon I'm glad I I developed
 

10683
03:31:15,779 --> 03:31:18,769
it too soon I'm glad I I developed
certain force a certain strengths

10684
03:31:18,769 --> 03:31:18,779
certain force a certain strengths
 

10685
03:31:18,779 --> 03:31:22,490
certain force a certain strengths
I was confident

10686
03:31:22,490 --> 03:31:22,500
I was confident
 

10687
03:31:22,500 --> 03:31:25,849
I was confident
um I was strong to withstand this and if

10688
03:31:25,849 --> 03:31:25,859
um I was strong to withstand this and if
 

10689
03:31:25,859 --> 03:31:28,190
um I was strong to withstand this and if
I weren't who knows how it could turn

10690
03:31:28,190 --> 03:31:28,200
I weren't who knows how it could turn
 

10691
03:31:28,200 --> 03:31:30,290
I weren't who knows how it could turn
out so it is a very subtle kind of

10692
03:31:30,290 --> 03:31:30,300
out so it is a very subtle kind of
 

10693
03:31:30,300 --> 03:31:31,729
out so it is a very subtle kind of
alchemical process

10694
03:31:31,729 --> 03:31:31,739
alchemical process
 

10695
03:31:31,739 --> 03:31:33,950
alchemical process
which I don't think there is a recipe

10696
03:31:33,950 --> 03:31:33,960
which I don't think there is a recipe
 

10697
03:31:33,960 --> 03:31:36,349
which I don't think there is a recipe
there's a formula

10698
03:31:36,349 --> 03:31:36,359
there's a formula
 

10699
03:31:36,359 --> 03:31:38,450
there's a formula
the reason I'm talking about this is

10700
03:31:38,450 --> 03:31:38,460
the reason I'm talking about this is
 

10701
03:31:38,460 --> 03:31:40,910
the reason I'm talking about this is
just to share this experience because I

10702
03:31:40,910 --> 03:31:40,920
just to share this experience because I
 

10703
03:31:40,920 --> 03:31:42,950
just to share this experience because I
think that the only thing we can do in

10704
03:31:42,950 --> 03:31:42,960
think that the only thing we can do in
 

10705
03:31:42,960 --> 03:31:44,929
think that the only thing we can do in
this in some sense is to share with each

10706
03:31:44,929 --> 03:31:44,939
this in some sense is to share with each
 

10707
03:31:44,939 --> 03:31:48,410
this in some sense is to share with each
other because then we can find

10708
03:31:48,410 --> 03:31:48,420
other because then we can find
 

10709
03:31:48,420 --> 03:31:50,690
other because then we can find
for instance if somebody

10710
03:31:50,690 --> 03:31:50,700
for instance if somebody
 

10711
03:31:50,700 --> 03:31:52,610
for instance if somebody
shared with me

10712
03:31:52,610 --> 03:31:52,620
shared with me
 

10713
03:31:52,620 --> 03:31:54,710
shared with me
it would naturally Lead Me Maybe to get

10714
03:31:54,710 --> 03:31:54,720
it would naturally Lead Me Maybe to get
 

10715
03:31:54,720 --> 03:31:56,750
it would naturally Lead Me Maybe to get
closer to that to kind of understanding

10716
03:31:56,750 --> 03:31:56,760
closer to that to kind of understanding
 

10717
03:31:56,760 --> 03:31:59,570
closer to that to kind of understanding
it's really just personal stories it's

10718
03:31:59,570 --> 03:31:59,580
it's really just personal stories it's
 

10719
03:31:59,580 --> 03:32:01,870
it's really just personal stories it's
not

10720
03:32:01,870 --> 03:32:01,880
not
 

10721
03:32:01,880 --> 03:32:04,490
not
obviously there is a there is a

10722
03:32:04,490 --> 03:32:04,500
obviously there is a there is a
 

10723
03:32:04,500 --> 03:32:06,229
obviously there is a there is a
component where professionals could be

10724
03:32:06,229 --> 03:32:06,239
component where professionals could be
 

10725
03:32:06,239 --> 03:32:08,210
component where professionals could be
involved professional therapists and so

10726
03:32:08,210 --> 03:32:08,220
involved professional therapists and so
 

10727
03:32:08,220 --> 03:32:10,190
involved professional therapists and so
on in my case it somehow happened

10728
03:32:10,190 --> 03:32:10,200
on in my case it somehow happened
 

10729
03:32:10,200 --> 03:32:13,250
on in my case it somehow happened
miraculously well I did have support but

10730
03:32:13,250 --> 03:32:13,260
miraculously well I did have support but
 

10731
03:32:13,260 --> 03:32:15,590
miraculously well I did have support but
not not from professional therapists but

10732
03:32:15,590 --> 03:32:15,600
not not from professional therapists but
 

10733
03:32:15,600 --> 03:32:17,269
not not from professional therapists but
from like dear friends

10734
03:32:17,269 --> 03:32:17,279
from like dear friends
 

10735
03:32:17,279 --> 03:32:19,130
from like dear friends
so I did I did have you didn't you do

10736
03:32:19,130 --> 03:32:19,140
so I did I did have you didn't you do
 

10737
03:32:19,140 --> 03:32:21,349
so I did I did have you didn't you do
need I had somebody at the time who

10738
03:32:21,349 --> 03:32:21,359
need I had somebody at the time who
 

10739
03:32:21,359 --> 03:32:23,330
need I had somebody at the time who
basically held my hand and through this

10740
03:32:23,330 --> 03:32:23,340
basically held my hand and through this
 

10741
03:32:23,340 --> 03:32:25,670
basically held my hand and through this
experience yes it was invaluable and it

10742
03:32:25,670 --> 03:32:25,680
experience yes it was invaluable and it
 

10743
03:32:25,680 --> 03:32:27,849
experience yes it was invaluable and it
could not be done otherwise

10744
03:32:27,849 --> 03:32:27,859
could not be done otherwise
 

10745
03:32:27,859 --> 03:32:32,030
could not be done otherwise
so I think it's very common and here's

10746
03:32:32,030 --> 03:32:32,040
so I think it's very common and here's
 

10747
03:32:32,040 --> 03:32:35,389
so I think it's very common and here's
the thing

10748
03:32:35,389 --> 03:32:35,399

 

10749
03:32:35,399 --> 03:32:39,469

I would not do it in any other way

10750
03:32:39,469 --> 03:32:39,479
I would not do it in any other way
 

10751
03:32:39,479 --> 03:32:42,650
I would not do it in any other way
when you when I reconnected

10752
03:32:42,650 --> 03:32:42,660
when you when I reconnected
 

10753
03:32:42,660 --> 03:32:45,229
when you when I reconnected
and I saw all the horrors and so on but

10754
03:32:45,229 --> 03:32:45,239
and I saw all the horrors and so on but
 

10755
03:32:45,239 --> 03:32:47,389
and I saw all the horrors and so on but
I also was able to see

10756
03:32:47,389 --> 03:32:47,399
I also was able to see
 

10757
03:32:47,399 --> 03:32:50,929
I also was able to see
that my examiners were victims

10758
03:32:50,929 --> 03:32:50,939
that my examiners were victims
 

10759
03:32:50,939 --> 03:32:52,670
that my examiners were victims
of Their Own

10760
03:32:52,670 --> 03:32:52,680
of Their Own
 

10761
03:32:52,680 --> 03:32:55,729
of Their Own
situation that they became they fell for

10762
03:32:55,729 --> 03:32:55,739
situation that they became they fell for
 

10763
03:32:55,739 --> 03:32:57,710
situation that they became they fell for
this bogus

10764
03:32:57,710 --> 03:32:57,720
this bogus
 

10765
03:32:57,720 --> 03:33:00,469
this bogus
series or maybe it was more of a issue

10766
03:33:00,469 --> 03:33:00,479
series or maybe it was more of a issue
 

10767
03:33:00,479 --> 03:33:03,590
series or maybe it was more of a issue
of career advancement or something and

10768
03:33:03,590 --> 03:33:03,600
of career advancement or something and
 

10769
03:33:03,600 --> 03:33:05,150
of career advancement or something and
I also realized they must have suffered

10770
03:33:05,150 --> 03:33:05,160
I also realized they must have suffered
 

10771
03:33:05,160 --> 03:33:07,729
I also realized they must have suffered
as well because they must have had some

10772
03:33:07,729 --> 03:33:07,739
as well because they must have had some
 

10773
03:33:07,739 --> 03:33:09,769
as well because they must have had some
kind of consciousness of conscience

10774
03:33:09,769 --> 03:33:09,779
kind of consciousness of conscience
 

10775
03:33:09,779 --> 03:33:12,170
kind of consciousness of conscience
about it that acting this way towards

10776
03:33:12,170 --> 03:33:12,180
about it that acting this way towards
 

10777
03:33:12,180 --> 03:33:13,250
about it that acting this way towards
sort of

10778
03:33:13,250 --> 03:33:13,260
sort of
 

10779
03:33:13,260 --> 03:33:15,889
sort of
basically kids you know

10780
03:33:15,889 --> 03:33:15,899
basically kids you know
 

10781
03:33:15,899 --> 03:33:17,690
basically kids you know
so it's not it wasn't pretty from their

10782
03:33:17,690 --> 03:33:17,700
so it's not it wasn't pretty from their
 

10783
03:33:17,700 --> 03:33:20,750
so it's not it wasn't pretty from their
point of view so I could forgive them

10784
03:33:20,750 --> 03:33:20,760
point of view so I could forgive them
 

10785
03:33:20,760 --> 03:33:24,050
point of view so I could forgive them
and I could like also appreciate what a

03:33:24,050 --> 03:33:24,060
and I could like also appreciate what a
 

10787
03:33:24,060 --> 03:33:26,530
and I could like also appreciate what a
what a boost of energy it gave me yeah

10788
03:33:26,530 --> 03:33:26,540
what a boost of energy it gave me yeah
 

10789
03:33:26,540 --> 03:33:29,929
what a boost of energy it gave me yeah
if I was accepted and I was just where I

drinking and who knows what maybe I
 

10799
03:33:37,979 --> 03:33:39,830
drinking and who knows what maybe I
wouldn't even become a mathematician

10800
03:33:39,830 --> 03:33:39,840
wouldn't even become a mathematician
 

10801
03:33:39,840 --> 03:33:41,630
wouldn't even become a mathematician
but this

10802
03:33:41,630 --> 03:33:41,640
but this
 

10803
03:33:41,640 --> 03:33:44,570
but this
focused me like a laser without me even

10804
03:33:44,570 --> 03:33:44,580
focused me like a laser without me even
 

10805
03:33:44,580 --> 03:33:46,729
focused me like a laser without me even
thinking about it it just happened I

10806
03:33:46,729 --> 03:33:46,739
thinking about it it just happened I
 

10807
03:33:46,739 --> 03:33:48,290

just I couldn't do I didn't care about
 

10809
03:33:48,300 --> 03:33:50,450
just I couldn't do I didn't care about
anything but doing mathematics and it

10810
03:33:50,450 --> 03:33:50,460
anything but doing mathematics and it
 

10811
03:33:50,460 --> 03:33:52,910
anything but doing mathematics and it
paid off you know it changed my life so

03:34:16,490 --> 03:34:16,500
and uh it was tough it was tough
 

10831
03:34:16,500 --> 03:34:19,429
and uh it was tough it was tough
and I was not

10832
03:34:19,429 --> 03:34:19,439
and I was not
 

10833
03:34:19,439 --> 03:34:22,429
and I was not
I was sort of not ready for it because

10834
03:34:22,429 --> 03:34:22,439
I was sort of not ready for it because
 

10835
03:34:22,439 --> 03:34:24,830
I was sort of not ready for it because
up until that point I lived pretending

10836
03:34:24,830 --> 03:34:24,840
up until that point I lived pretending
 

10837
03:34:24,840 --> 03:34:26,870
up until that point I lived pretending
that death does not exist

10838
03:34:26,870 --> 03:34:26,880
that death does not exist
 

10839
03:34:26,880 --> 03:34:29,570
that death does not exist
when my grandparents died I was already

in the U.S
 

10843
03:34:31,140 --> 03:34:33,050
in the U.S
so it's very convenient and I couldn't

10844
03:34:33,050 --> 03:34:33,060
so it's very convenient and I couldn't
 

10845
03:34:33,060 --> 03:34:36,950
so it's very convenient and I couldn't
go back so I grieved but it kind of was

10846
03:34:36,950 --> 03:34:36,960
go back so I grieved but it kind of was
 

10847
03:34:36,960 --> 03:34:38,990
go back so I grieved but it kind of was
a bit abstract for me I didn't see their

10848
03:34:38,990 --> 03:34:39,000
a bit abstract for me I didn't see their
 

10849
03:34:39,000 --> 03:34:41,809
a bit abstract for me I didn't see their
dead bodies you know I didn't

10850
03:34:41,809 --> 03:34:41,819
dead bodies you know I didn't
 

10851
03:34:41,819 --> 03:34:46,490
dead bodies you know I didn't
bury them and so on so I waited till so

10852
03:34:46,490 --> 03:34:46,500
bury them and so on so I waited till so
 

10853
03:34:46,500 --> 03:34:48,530
bury them and so on so I waited till so
my the first death in my life was my

10854
03:34:48,530 --> 03:34:48,540
my the first death in my life was my

so
 

10877
03:35:13,500 --> 03:35:15,530
so
and then suddenly it's not there

10878
03:35:15,530 --> 03:35:15,540
and then suddenly it's not there
 

10879

and then suddenly it's not there
so it's tough but it kind of changed my

I miss intermittently but I in a way I
learned that he never left me in some I

10888
03:35:28,969 --> 03:35:28,979
learned that he never left me in some I
 

10889

mean it sounds so words are so you know

10890
03:35:31,790 --> 03:35:31,800
mean it sounds so words are so you know
 

10891
03:35:31,800 --> 03:35:34,030
mean it sounds so words are so you know
like they are

10892
03:35:34,030 --> 03:35:34,040
like they are
 

10893
03:35:34,040 --> 03:35:37,190
like they are
they cannot express in words this what

10894
03:35:37,190 --> 03:35:37,200
they cannot express in words this what
 

10895
03:35:37,200 --> 03:35:38,690
they cannot express in words this what
I'm trying to say

10896
03:35:38,690 --> 03:35:38,700
I'm trying to say
 

10897
03:35:38,700 --> 03:35:40,190
I'm trying to say
but

10898
03:35:40,190 --> 03:35:40,200
but
 

10899
03:35:40,200 --> 03:35:42,050
but
um do you carry him

10900
03:35:42,050 --> 03:35:42,060
um do you carry him
 

10901
03:35:42,060 --> 03:35:45,170
um do you carry him
with you yeah and in some sense I always

10902
03:35:45,170 --> 03:35:45,180
with you yeah and in some sense I always
 

10903
03:35:45,180 --> 03:35:47,750
with you yeah and in some sense I always
did and and I

10904
03:35:47,750 --> 03:35:47,760
did and and I
 

10905
03:35:47,760 --> 03:35:48,429
did and and I
I

10906
03:35:48,429 --> 03:35:48,439
I
 

10907
03:35:48,439 --> 03:35:52,729
I
saw that that it's always been

10908
03:35:52,729 --> 03:35:52,739
saw that that it's always been
 

10909
03:35:52,739 --> 03:35:55,670
saw that that it's always been
um it was really we were one in some

10910
03:35:55,670 --> 03:35:55,680
um it was really we were one in some
 

10911
03:35:55,680 --> 03:35:57,170
um it was really we were one in some
sense you know like we were but there

10912
03:35:57,170 --> 03:35:57,180
sense you know like we were but there
 

10913
03:35:57,180 --> 03:36:00,830
sense you know like we were but there
was this experience of

10914
03:36:00,830 --> 03:36:00,840

 

10915
03:36:00,840 --> 03:36:02,929

two two people

10916
03:36:02,929 --> 03:36:02,939
two two people
 

10917
03:36:02,939 --> 03:36:05,450
two two people
being together and that I missed

10918
03:36:05,450 --> 03:36:05,460
being together and that I missed
 

10919
03:36:05,460 --> 03:36:07,790
being together and that I missed
tremendously

10920
03:36:07,790 --> 03:36:07,800
tremendously
 

10921
03:36:07,800 --> 03:36:11,210
tremendously
but he gave me so much and I you know

10922
03:36:11,210 --> 03:36:11,220
but he gave me so much and I you know
 

10923
03:36:11,220 --> 03:36:13,250
but he gave me so much and I you know
let me tell you one aspect of it for

10924
03:36:13,250 --> 03:36:13,260
let me tell you one aspect of it for
 

10925
03:36:13,260 --> 03:36:14,570
let me tell you one aspect of it for
instance

10926
03:36:14,570 --> 03:36:14,580
instance
 

10927
03:36:14,580 --> 03:36:17,090
instance
when he was a kid his father was sent to

10928
03:36:17,090 --> 03:36:17,100
when he was a kid his father was sent to
 

10929
03:36:17,100 --> 03:36:19,910
when he was a kid his father was sent to
Gulag on bogus pretenses right so he

10930
03:36:19,910 --> 03:36:19,920
Gulag on bogus pretenses right so he
 

10931
03:36:19,920 --> 03:36:22,429
Gulag on bogus pretenses right so he
when he was 16 he replied to University

10932
03:36:22,429 --> 03:36:22,439
when he was 16 he replied to University
 

10933
03:36:22,439 --> 03:36:23,870
when he was 16 he replied to University
he wanted to become a theoretical

10934
03:36:23,870 --> 03:36:23,880
he wanted to become a theoretical
 

10935
03:36:23,880 --> 03:36:25,010
he wanted to become a theoretical
physicist

10936
03:36:25,010 --> 03:36:25,020
physicist
 

10937
03:36:25,020 --> 03:36:27,170
physicist
by the way my love for trichophysics was

10938
03:36:27,170 --> 03:36:27,180
by the way my love for trichophysics was
 

10939
03:36:27,180 --> 03:36:28,790
by the way my love for trichophysics was
to the large extent

10940
03:36:28,790 --> 03:36:28,800
to the large extent
 

10941
03:36:28,800 --> 03:36:30,229
to the large extent
because of that

10942
03:36:30,229 --> 03:36:30,239
because of that
 

10943
03:36:30,239 --> 03:36:32,210
because of that
and he was not accepted even though he

10944
03:36:32,210 --> 03:36:32,220
and he was not accepted even though he
 

10945
03:36:32,220 --> 03:36:34,250
and he was not accepted even though he
was brilliant because he was the son of

10946
03:36:34,250 --> 03:36:34,260
was brilliant because he was the son of
 

10947
03:36:34,260 --> 03:36:36,769
was brilliant because he was the son of
the enemy of the people

10948
03:36:36,769 --> 03:36:36,779
the enemy of the people
 

10949
03:36:36,779 --> 03:36:38,990
the enemy of the people
and he

10950
03:36:38,990 --> 03:36:39,000
and he
 

10951
03:36:39,000 --> 03:36:41,809
and he
kind of broke him this experience that

10952
03:36:41,809 --> 03:36:41,819
kind of broke him this experience that
 

10953
03:36:41,819 --> 03:36:42,650
kind of broke him this experience that
he

10954
03:36:42,650 --> 03:36:42,660
he
 

10955
03:36:42,660 --> 03:36:45,290
he
didn't care when he was you know he went

10956
03:36:45,290 --> 03:36:45,300
didn't care when he was you know he went
 

10957
03:36:45,300 --> 03:36:46,729
didn't care when he was you know he went
to technical school and he didn't really

10958
03:36:46,729 --> 03:36:46,739
to technical school and he didn't really
 

10959
03:36:46,739 --> 03:36:49,370
to technical school and he didn't really
care that's my take on it

10960
03:36:49,370 --> 03:36:49,380
care that's my take on it
 

10961
03:36:49,380 --> 03:36:51,769
care that's my take on it
and then he ended up in this in this in

10962
03:36:51,769 --> 03:36:51,779
and then he ended up in this in this in
 

10963
03:36:51,779 --> 03:36:53,929
and then he ended up in this in this in
this little provincial town and he

10964
03:36:53,929 --> 03:36:53,939
this little provincial town and he
 

10965
03:36:53,939 --> 03:36:55,190
this little provincial town and he
thought he would escape from it as soon

10966
03:36:55,190 --> 03:36:55,200
thought he would escape from it as soon
 

10967
03:36:55,200 --> 03:36:56,510
thought he would escape from it as soon
as possible and then he met my mother

10968
03:36:56,510 --> 03:36:56,520
as possible and then he met my mother
 

10969
03:36:56,520 --> 03:36:59,510
as possible and then he met my mother
and I fell in love

10970
03:36:59,510 --> 03:36:59,520
and I fell in love
 

10971
03:36:59,520 --> 03:37:02,870
and I fell in love
and so I am sort of the product the

10972
03:37:02,870 --> 03:37:02,880
and so I am sort of the product the
 

10973
03:37:02,880 --> 03:37:05,210
and so I am sort of the product the
product of that you know of physics but

10974
03:37:05,210 --> 03:37:05,220
product of that you know of physics but
 

10975
03:37:05,220 --> 03:37:06,050
product of that you know of physics but
then

10976
03:37:06,050 --> 03:37:06,060
then
 

10977
03:37:06,060 --> 03:37:09,170
then
what I learned is that

10978
03:37:09,170 --> 03:37:09,180
what I learned is that
 

10979
03:37:09,180 --> 03:37:11,510
what I learned is that
because he was not able to overcome that

10980
03:37:11,510 --> 03:37:11,520
because he was not able to overcome that
 

10981
03:37:11,520 --> 03:37:13,429
because he was not able to overcome that
specific experience

10982
03:37:13,429 --> 03:37:13,439
specific experience
 

10983
03:37:13,439 --> 03:37:16,090
specific experience
it felt to me to do it and if I didn't

10984
03:37:16,090 --> 03:37:16,100
it felt to me to do it and if I didn't
 

10985
03:37:16,100 --> 03:37:18,950
it felt to me to do it and if I didn't
my son of my daughter would have I think

10986
03:37:18,950 --> 03:37:18,960
my son of my daughter would have I think

I don't think it's possible for science
 

11265
03:42:51,000 --> 03:42:54,410
I don't think it's possible for science
to explain exactly what it is you can do

11266
03:42:54,410 --> 03:42:54,420
to explain exactly what it is you can do
 

11267

to explain exactly what it is you can do
uh evolutionary biology perspective you

11268
03:42:57,229 --> 03:42:57,239
uh evolutionary biology perspective you
 

11269
03:42:57,239 --> 03:42:59,269
uh evolutionary biology perspective you
can talk about some kind of Sociology

11270
03:42:59,269 --> 03:42:59,279
can talk about some kind of Sociology
 

11271
03:42:59,279 --> 03:43:01,610
can talk about some kind of Sociology
perspective psychology perspective but

11272
03:43:01,610 --> 03:43:01,620
perspective psychology perspective but
 

11273
03:43:01,620 --> 03:43:02,889
perspective psychology perspective but
the experience

11274
03:43:02,889 --> 03:43:02,899
the experience
 

11275
03:43:02,899 --> 03:43:06,590
the experience
where you forget or time we're reminded

11276
03:43:06,590 --> 03:43:06,600
where you forget or time we're reminded
 

11277
03:43:06,600 --> 03:43:08,750
where you forget or time we're reminded
becomes an illusion and everything just

11278
03:43:08,750 --> 03:43:08,760
becomes an illusion and everything just
 

11279
03:43:08,760 --> 03:43:10,490

freezes oh my God

11282
03:43:13,490 --> 03:43:13,500
and then uh it's kind of beautiful and
 

11283
03:43:13,500 --> 03:43:15,349
and then uh it's kind of beautiful and
painful to hear you say that when you've

11284
03:43:15,349 --> 03:43:15,359
painful to hear you say that when you've
 

11285
03:43:15,359 --> 03:43:18,410
painful to hear you say that when you've
experienced love the deepest is when you

11295
03:43:28,080 --> 03:43:29,870
connection with my father like really on
so so many levels

11296
03:43:29,870 --> 03:43:29,880
so so many levels
 

11297
03:43:29,880 --> 03:43:32,510
so so many levels
if they weren't a moment that's how I

11298
03:43:32,510 --> 03:43:32,520
if they weren't a moment that's how I
 

11299
03:43:32,520 --> 03:43:33,950
if they weren't a moment that's how I
see it and I'm not trying to say that's

11300
03:43:33,950 --> 03:43:33,960
see it and I'm not trying to say that's
 

11301
03:43:33,960 --> 03:43:35,570
see it and I'm not trying to say that's
how everybody should see for instance I

11302
03:43:35,570 --> 03:43:35,580
how everybody should see for instance I
 

11303
03:43:35,580 --> 03:43:38,210
how everybody should see for instance I
respect Rey Kurzweil I respect and I

11304
03:43:38,210 --> 03:43:38,220
respect Rey Kurzweil I respect and I
 

11305
03:43:38,220 --> 03:43:40,190
respect Rey Kurzweil I respect and I
feel and I almost like I I feel good

11306
03:43:40,190 --> 03:43:40,200
feel and I almost like I I feel good
 

11307
03:43:40,200 --> 03:43:44,690
feel and I almost like I I feel good
bumps right now I feel that desire to

11308
03:43:44,690 --> 03:43:44,700
bumps right now I feel that desire to
 

11309
03:43:44,700 --> 03:43:46,849
bumps right now I feel that desire to
reconnect

11310
03:43:46,849 --> 03:43:46,859
reconnect
 

11311
03:43:46,859 --> 03:43:50,330
reconnect
even if it is in the form of a you know

11312
03:43:50,330 --> 03:43:50,340
even if it is in the form of a you know
 

11313
03:43:50,340 --> 03:43:52,190
even if it is in the form of a you know
a computer program let's be honest about

11314
03:43:52,190 --> 03:43:52,200
a computer program let's be honest about
 

11315
03:43:52,200 --> 03:43:56,030
a computer program let's be honest about
it I find it to be very moving I find it

11316
03:43:56,030 --> 03:43:56,040
it I find it to be very moving I find it
 

11317
03:43:56,040 --> 03:43:57,590
it I find it to be very moving I find it
very moving and I understand because he

11318
03:43:57,590 --> 03:43:57,600
very moving and I understand because he
 

11319
03:43:57,600 --> 03:43:58,849
very moving and I understand because he
actually didn't have a chance to spend

11320
03:43:58,849 --> 03:43:58,859
actually didn't have a chance to spend
 

11321
03:43:58,859 --> 03:44:00,769
actually didn't have a chance to spend
much time you know I think he was 16 or

11322
03:44:00,769 --> 03:44:00,779
much time you know I think he was 16 or
 

11323
03:44:00,779 --> 03:44:02,809
much time you know I think he was 16 or
17 when he's he was a teenager he's dead

11324
03:44:02,809 --> 03:44:02,819
17 when he's he was a teenager he's dead
 

11325
03:44:02,819 --> 03:44:04,910
17 when he's he was a teenager he's dead
I was lucky because my father died I was

11326
03:44:04,910 --> 03:44:04,920
I was lucky because my father died I was
 

11327
03:44:04,920 --> 03:44:06,889
I was lucky because my father died I was
much older I've had so many moments with

11328
03:44:06,889 --> 03:44:06,899
much older I've had so many moments with
 

11329
03:44:06,899 --> 03:44:10,309
much older I've had so many moments with
him but that's not my thing like I think

11330
03:44:10,309 --> 03:44:10,319
him but that's not my thing like I think
 

11331
03:44:10,319 --> 03:44:12,590
him but that's not my thing like I think
it is the feature it's not a bug and it

11332
03:44:12,590 --> 03:44:12,600
it is the feature it's not a bug and it
 

11333
03:44:12,600 --> 03:44:14,269
it is the feature it's not a bug and it
sounds crazy like I would love I would

11334
03:44:14,269 --> 03:44:14,279
sounds crazy like I would love I would
 

11335
03:44:14,279 --> 03:44:16,130
sounds crazy like I would love I would
give anything to have him or here right

11336
03:44:16,130 --> 03:44:16,140
give anything to have him or here right
 

11337
03:44:16,140 --> 03:44:18,469
give anything to have him or here right
now right now I everything I have I give

11338
03:44:18,469 --> 03:44:18,479
now right now I everything I have I give
 

11339
03:44:18,479 --> 03:44:20,389
now right now I everything I have I give
it away right now yeah where do I sign

11340
03:44:20,389 --> 03:44:20,399
it away right now yeah where do I sign
 

11341
03:44:20,399 --> 03:44:23,150
it away right now yeah where do I sign
yeah just see him for one hour I promise

11342
03:44:23,150 --> 03:44:23,160
yeah just see him for one hour I promise
 

11343
03:44:23,160 --> 03:44:24,290
yeah just see him for one hour I promise
you I will

11344
03:44:24,290 --> 03:44:24,300
you I will
 

11345
03:44:24,300 --> 03:44:28,610
you I will
but I also know that I it then I'll

11346
03:44:28,610 --> 03:44:28,620
but I also know that I it then I'll
 

11347
03:44:28,620 --> 03:44:29,870
but I also know that I it then I'll
still lose him

11348
03:44:29,870 --> 03:44:29,880
still lose him
 

11349
03:44:29,880 --> 03:44:31,910
still lose him
or I will die or whatever you know so

11350
03:44:31,910 --> 03:44:31,920
or I will die or whatever you know so
 

11351
03:44:31,920 --> 03:44:34,429
or I will die or whatever you know so
that thing so what is why is it so worse

11352
03:44:34,429 --> 03:44:34,439
that thing so what is why is it so worse
 

11353
03:44:34,439 --> 03:44:36,530
that thing so what is why is it so worse
to just hold hold on to holding on to it

11354
03:44:36,530 --> 03:44:36,540
to just hold hold on to holding on to it
 

11355
03:44:36,540 --> 03:44:39,410
to just hold hold on to holding on to it
why why are we holding on to this and I

11356
03:44:39,410 --> 03:44:39,420
why why are we holding on to this and I
 

11357
03:44:39,420 --> 03:44:41,090
why why are we holding on to this and I
am the first sucker I'm the first man to

11358
03:44:41,090 --> 03:44:41,100
am the first sucker I'm the first man to
 

11359
03:44:41,100 --> 03:44:43,429
am the first sucker I'm the first man to
hold on but I'm questioning it now like

11360
03:44:43,429 --> 03:44:43,439
hold on but I'm questioning it now like
 

11361
03:44:43,439 --> 03:44:45,710
hold on but I'm questioning it now like
is there another way to approach life

11362
03:44:45,710 --> 03:44:45,720
is there another way to approach life
 

11363
03:44:45,720 --> 03:44:47,870
is there another way to approach life
where you just you know how Buddha it's

11364
03:44:47,870 --> 03:44:47,880
where you just you know how Buddha it's
 

11365
03:44:47,880 --> 03:44:50,030
where you just you know how Buddha it's
like

11366
03:44:50,030 --> 03:44:50,040
like
 

11367
03:44:50,040 --> 03:44:54,050
like
just let it go enjoy and let it go enjoy

11368
03:44:54,050 --> 03:44:54,060
just let it go enjoy and let it go enjoy
 

11369
03:44:54,060 --> 03:44:56,210
just let it go enjoy and let it go enjoy
and let it go is it possible

11370
03:44:56,210 --> 03:44:56,220
and let it go is it possible
 

11371
03:44:56,220 --> 03:44:59,090
and let it go is it possible
except the Paradox of it

11372
03:44:59,090 --> 03:44:59,100
except the Paradox of it
 

11373
03:44:59,100 --> 03:45:01,130
except the Paradox of it
well ask me in a couple of years you

11374
03:45:01,130 --> 03:45:01,140
well ask me in a couple of years you
 

11375
03:45:01,140 --> 03:45:03,769
well ask me in a couple of years you
know I will report but I think that it

11376
03:45:03,769 --> 03:45:03,779
know I will report but I think that it
 

11377
03:45:03,779 --> 03:45:06,530
know I will report but I think that it
but to my mathematical mind yeah it

11378
03:45:06,530 --> 03:45:06,540
but to my mathematical mind yeah it
 

11379
03:45:06,540 --> 03:45:08,870
but to my mathematical mind yeah it
sounds like a very interesting idea to

11380
03:45:08,870 --> 03:45:08,880
sounds like a very interesting idea to
 

11381
03:45:08,880 --> 03:45:11,630
sounds like a very interesting idea to
be honest because to me the idea of

11382
03:45:11,630 --> 03:45:11,640
be honest because to me the idea of
 

11383
03:45:11,640 --> 03:45:13,910
be honest because to me the idea of
holding isn't it sounds like an impasse

11384
03:45:13,910 --> 03:45:13,920
holding isn't it sounds like an impasse
 

11385
03:45:13,920 --> 03:45:16,190
holding isn't it sounds like an impasse
because no matter in all my experience

11386
03:45:16,190 --> 03:45:16,200
because no matter in all my experience
 

11387
03:45:16,200 --> 03:45:18,229
because no matter in all my experience
and if you look in history every time

11388
03:45:18,229 --> 03:45:18,239
and if you look in history every time
 

11389
03:45:18,239 --> 03:45:20,570
and if you look in history every time
somebody's holding you know it's how

11390
03:45:20,570 --> 03:45:20,580
somebody's holding you know it's how
 

11391
03:45:20,580 --> 03:45:22,190
somebody's holding you know it's how
they said in The Matrix whatever has a

11392
03:45:22,190 --> 03:45:22,200
they said in The Matrix whatever has a
 

11393
03:45:22,200 --> 03:45:23,870
they said in The Matrix whatever has a
beginning has an end it's like you

11394
03:45:23,870 --> 03:45:23,880
beginning has an end it's like you
 

11395
03:45:23,880 --> 03:45:25,790
beginning has an end it's like you
cannot go around it if you have a

11396
03:45:25,790 --> 03:45:25,800
cannot go around it if you have a
 

11397
03:45:25,800 --> 03:45:27,710
cannot go around it if you have a
beginning you could have an end so then

11398
03:45:27,710 --> 03:45:27,720
beginning you could have an end so then
 

11399
03:45:27,720 --> 03:45:30,229
beginning you could have an end so then
might as well just enjoy it and not

11400
03:45:30,229 --> 03:45:30,239
might as well just enjoy it and not
 

11401
03:45:30,239 --> 03:45:33,889
might as well just enjoy it and not
worry too much about extending it longer

11402
03:45:33,889 --> 03:45:33,899
worry too much about extending it longer
 

11403
03:45:33,899 --> 03:45:35,269
worry too much about extending it longer
that's how I see it now but maybe

11404
03:45:35,269 --> 03:45:35,279
that's how I see it now but maybe
 

11405
03:45:35,279 --> 03:45:37,809
that's how I see it now but maybe
tomorrow will be something else you know

11406
03:45:37,809 --> 03:45:37,819
tomorrow will be something else you know
 

11407
03:45:37,819 --> 03:45:40,670
tomorrow will be something else you know
