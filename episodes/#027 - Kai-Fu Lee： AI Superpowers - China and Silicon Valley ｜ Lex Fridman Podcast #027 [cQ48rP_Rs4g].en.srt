known technologies and trying new things
 

217

but it's also about picking from many
 

219
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,420
but it's also about picking from many
parts of possible networks to use and

00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:00,430
parts of possible networks to use and
 

221
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,370
parts of possible networks to use and
different types of parameters to tune

different types of parameters to tune
 

223
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,210

and that part is somewhat rote and it is
 

225
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,939
and that part is somewhat rote and it is
also as anyone who's built AI products

00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:08,949
also as anyone who's built AI products
 

227
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:11,730
also as anyone who's built AI products
can tell you a lot about cleansing the

can tell you a lot about cleansing the
 

229
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,339
can tell you a lot about cleansing the

that would put the Chinese approach more

328
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:37,780
that would put the Chinese approach more

that would put the Chinese approach more
challenged and give them more

more of an edge on those kinds of

334
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:44,920
more of an edge on those kinds of
 

335
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,800
more of an edge on those kinds of
problems so let me talk to that a little

336
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:46,810
problems so let me talk to that a little
 

337
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,560
problems so let me talk to that a little
more so you know my intuition personally

338
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:49,570
more so you know my intuition personally
 

339
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,850
more so you know my intuition personally
is that data can take us extremely far

340
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:52,860
is that data can take us extremely far
 

341
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,290
is that data can take us extremely far
so you brought up autonomous vehicles

342
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:55,300
so you brought up autonomous vehicles
 

343
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,270
so you brought up autonomous vehicles
and medical diagnosis so your intuition

344
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,280
and medical diagnosis so your intuition
 

345
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,390
and medical diagnosis so your intuition
is that huge amounts of data might not

346
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,400
is that huge amounts of data might not
 

347
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,550
is that huge amounts of data might not
be able to completely help us solve that

348
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:02,560
be able to completely help us solve that
 

349
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,850
be able to completely help us solve that
problem right so breaking that down

350
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:05,860
problem right so breaking that down
 

351
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,429
problem right so breaking that down
further in autonomous vehicle I think

352
00:08:08,429 --> 00:08:08,439
further in autonomous vehicle I think
 

353
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:10,619
further in autonomous vehicle I think
huge amounts of data probably will solve

354
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:10,629
huge amounts of data probably will solve
 

355
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:13,469
huge amounts of data probably will solve

they're trying to solve that purely with
 

387
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,880
they're trying to solve that purely with

basically no competitors anywhere and
 

619
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:09,610
basically no competitors anywhere and
that has also led to belief that these

that has also led to belief that these
 

621
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,580
that has also led to belief that these
are the only things that one should do

flexibility and the speed and execution
 

693
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:02,290

1378
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:34,070
government's return so that's
 

1379
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:37,720

interesting incentive that and trusts

1388
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:47,090
profits I'll move that way so this is
 

1389
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,480
profits I'll move that way so this is
really fascinating right so I look at

1390
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:49,490
really fascinating right so I look at
 

1391
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:51,000
really fascinating right so I look at
the Russian government as a case study

1392
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,010
the Russian government as a case study
 

1393
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:54,820
the Russian government as a case study
where let me put it this way there is no

1394
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:54,830
where let me put it this way there is no
 

1395
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:58,480
where let me put it this way there is no
such government driven large-scale

1396
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:58,490
such government driven large-scale
 

1397
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:01,780
such government driven large-scale
support of entrepreneurship and probably

1398
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:01,790
support of entrepreneurship and probably
 

1399
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,220
support of entrepreneurship and probably
the same is true in the United States

1400
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:03,230
the same is true in the United States
 

1401
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:05,920
the same is true in the United States
but the entrepreneurs themselves kind of

1402
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:05,930
but the entrepreneurs themselves kind of
 

1403
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:09,760
but the entrepreneurs themselves kind of
find a way yeah so maybe in a form of

1404
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:09,770
find a way yeah so maybe in a form of
 

1405
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:12,220
find a way yeah so maybe in a form of
advice or explanation how did the

1406
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:12,230
advice or explanation how did the
 

1407
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:15,310
advice or explanation how did the
Chinese government arrive to be this way

1408
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:15,320
Chinese government arrive to be this way
 

1409
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,340
Chinese government arrive to be this way
so supportive entrepreneurship to be in

1410
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:18,350
so supportive entrepreneurship to be in
 

1411
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:21,220
so supportive entrepreneurship to be in
this particular way so forward-thinking

1412
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:21,230
this particular way so forward-thinking
 

1413
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,910
this particular way so forward-thinking
at such a large scale and also perhaps

1414
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:23,920
at such a large scale and also perhaps
 

1415
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,680
at such a large scale and also perhaps
how can we copy it in other countries

1416
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:26,690
how can we copy it in other countries
 

1417
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:29,140
how can we copy it in other countries
yeah that how can we encourage other

1418
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:29,150
yeah that how can we encourage other
 

1419
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,730
yeah that how can we encourage other
governments given the United States

1420

autonomous vehicles in that same kind of

1424
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:34,550
autonomous vehicles in that same kind of
 

1425
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:39,250
autonomous vehicles in that same kind of
way perhaps yes so these some techniques

1426
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:39,260
way perhaps yes so these some techniques
 

1427
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:43,680
way perhaps yes so these some techniques
are the result of several key things

1428
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:43,690
are the result of several key things
 

1429
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:46,210
are the result of several key things
some of which may be learn the both some

1430
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:46,220
some of which may be learn the both some
 

1431
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:49,450
some of which may be learn the both some
of which may be very hard one is just

1432
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:49,460
of which may be very hard one is just
 

1433
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,250
of which may be very hard one is just
trial and error and watching what

1434
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:51,260
trial and error and watching what
 

1435
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,350
trial and error and watching what
everyone else is doing I think it's

came from Israel and China made a few
 

1445
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:06,430
came from Israel and China made a few
tweaks and turned it into a because the

Chinese cities and government officials
 

1449
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,380
Chinese cities and government officials
kind of compete with each other because

1450
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:11,390
kind of compete with each other because
 

1451
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:13,840
kind of compete with each other because
they all want to make their city more

1457
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:22,480

career and it's somewhat competitive so

1458
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:22,490
career and it's somewhat competitive so
 

1459
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:24,430
career and it's somewhat competitive so
the central government made it a bit of

00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:24,440
the central government made it a bit of
 

1461
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,320
the central government made it a bit of
a competition everybody has a budget

1462
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:26,330
a competition everybody has a budget

then whoever gets the results the city

1468
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:34,490
then whoever gets the results the city
 

1469
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:36,250

so the tools

1474
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:39,980
so the tools
 

1475
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,500
so the tools
kind of almost like an entrepreneurial

researchers just give them money and

1486
00:34:59,410 --> 00:34:59,420
researchers just give them money and
 

1487
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,270

given money to academic research labs
 

1491
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,530
given money to academic research labs
maybe government research labs to see if

1492
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:08,540
maybe government research labs to see if
 

1493
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,990
maybe government research labs to see if
they can spin-off some companies from

1494
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:11,000
they can spin-off some companies from
 

1495
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,290
they can spin-off some companies from
the science lab or something like that

1496
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:13,300
the science lab or something like that
 

1497
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,270

Chinese to come back and start companies
 

1501
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:21,250
Chinese to come back and start companies
and they've had mixed results the one

1502
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:21,260
and they've had mixed results the one
 

1503

that worked the best was the guiding

1504
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:22,609
that worked the best was the guiding
 

1505
00:35:22,609 --> 00:35:24,940
that worked the best was the guiding
funds so it's almost like a Lean Startup

1506
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:24,950
funds so it's almost like a Lean Startup
 

1507
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:27,220

idea where people try different things

1508
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:27,230
idea where people try different things
 

1509
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:29,740

copies so now every city has a guiding

1512
00:35:32,109 --> 00:35:32,119
copies so now every city has a guiding
 

1513
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:35,530
copies so now every city has a guiding
fund so that's how that came about

1514
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:35,540
fund so that's how that came about
 

1515
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:39,880
fund so that's how that came about
the autonomous vehicle and the massive

private freeway but there are things the
 

1531
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:03,099

market can't afford to do like
 

1533
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:06,630
market can't afford to do like
infrastructure so the government always

1534
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:06,640
infrastructure so the government always
 

1535
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,760
infrastructure so the government always
appropriate large amounts of money for

infrastructure building this happened

1538
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:12,760
infrastructure building this happened
 

1539
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,240
infrastructure building this happened
happens with not only autonomous vehicle

1540
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:16,250
happens with not only autonomous vehicle

1544
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:20,990
but happened with the 3G and 4G you'll
 

1545
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:24,310
but happened with the 3G and 4G you'll
find that the Chinese a wireless

because massive spending that tries to

1550
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,030
because massive spending that tries to
 

1551
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,270
because massive spending that tries to
cover the whole country whereas in the

00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:42,400
government driven because I think they
view the coverage of of cell access and

opposed to capitalistic so that's of
 

1565
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:52,599
opposed to capitalistic so that's of

think on the autonomous vehicle space

1592
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:24,730
think on the autonomous vehicle space
 

1593
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:28,420
think on the autonomous vehicle space
it's possible to solve the problem of

investment in infrastructure well that's
 

1599
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,910
investment in infrastructure well that's
really hard to speculate I think it's

00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,550
really hard to speculate I think it's
not a yes/no question but how long does

1602
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:39,560
not a yes/no question but how long does
 

1603
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,880
not a yes/no question but how long does
it take question you know 15 years 30

1604
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:42,890
it take question you know 15 years 30
 

1605
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:45,940
it take question you know 15 years 30
years 45 years clearly with

1606
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:45,950
years 45 years clearly with
 

1607
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:49,150
years 45 years clearly with
infrastructure augmentation where

1608
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:49,160
infrastructure augmentation where
 

1609
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,850
infrastructure augmentation where
there's ro the city or whole city

1610
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:51,860
there's ro the city or whole city
 

1611
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:55,000
there's ro the city or whole city
planning building a new city I'm sure

1612
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,010
planning building a new city I'm sure
 

1613
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:58,770
planning building a new city I'm sure
that will accelerate the day of the l5 I

1614
00:37:58,770 --> 00:37:58,780
that will accelerate the day of the l5 I
 

1615
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,510
that will accelerate the day of the l5 I
I'm not knowledgeable enough and it's

1616
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:01,520
I'm not knowledgeable enough and it's
 

1617
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,280
I'm not knowledgeable enough and it's
hard to predict even one we're

1618
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:03,290
hard to predict even one we're
 

1619
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,810
hard to predict even one we're
knowledgeable because a lot of it is

1620
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:04,820
knowledgeable because a lot of it is
 

1621
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:09,340
knowledgeable because a lot of it is
speculative but in the US I don't think

1622
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:09,350
speculative but in the US I don't think
 

1623
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,350
speculative but in the US I don't think
people would consider building a new

1624
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:11,360
people would consider building a new
 

1625
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,960
people would consider building a new
city the size of Chicago to make it a I

1626
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:13,970
city the size of Chicago to make it a I
 

1627
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:16,420
city the size of Chicago to make it a I
slash autonomous city they're smaller

1628
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:16,430
slash autonomous city they're smaller
 

1629
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,220
slash autonomous city they're smaller
ones being built I'm aware of that

1630
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:18,230
ones being built I'm aware of that
 

1631
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:21,190
ones being built I'm aware of that
but is infrastructure spent really

1632
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:21,200
but is infrastructure spent really
 

1633
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,800
but is infrastructure spent really
impossible for us or Western countries I

1634
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:23,810
impossible for us or Western countries I
 

1635
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:27,190
impossible for us or Western countries I
don't think so the u.s. highway system

1636
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:27,200
don't think so the u.s. highway system
 

1637
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,100
don't think so the u.s. highway system
was built was that during President

1638
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:30,110
was built was that during President
 

1639
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,710
was built was that during President
Eisenhower or Kennedy as Eisenhower yeah

1640
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:32,720
Eisenhower or Kennedy as Eisenhower yeah
 

1641
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:37,390
Eisenhower or Kennedy as Eisenhower yeah
so so so maybe historians can study how

1642
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:37,400
so so so maybe historians can study how
 

1643
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,310
so so so maybe historians can study how
the President Eisenhower get the

1644
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:39,320
the President Eisenhower get the
 

1645
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,560
the President Eisenhower get the
resources to build this massive

1646
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:41,570
resources to build this massive
 

1647
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:44,620
resources to build this massive
infrastructure that surely gave us

1648
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:44,630
infrastructure that surely gave us
 

1649
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:47,920
infrastructure that surely gave us
tremendous amount of prosperity over the

1650
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:47,930
tremendous amount of prosperity over the
 

1651
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:51,250
tremendous amount of prosperity over the
next decade if not century if I may

1652
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:51,260
next decade if not century if I may
 

1653
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,860
next decade if not century if I may
comment on that then it takes us to

1654
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:53,870
comment on that then it takes us to
 

1655
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:55,330
comment on that then it takes us to
artificial intelligence a little bit

1656
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:55,340
artificial intelligence a little bit
 

1657
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,310
artificial intelligence a little bit
because in order to build infrastructure

1658
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:57,320
because in order to build infrastructure
 

1659
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,880
because in order to build infrastructure
it it creates a lot of jobs so I'll be

1660
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:00,890
it it creates a lot of jobs so I'll be
 

1661
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:03,220
it it creates a lot of jobs so I'll be
actually interested if you would say

1662
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:03,230
actually interested if you would say
 

1663
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:05,650
actually interested if you would say
that you talk in your book about all

1664
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:05,660
that you talk in your book about all
 

1665
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,180
that you talk in your book about all
kinds of jobs that could

1666
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:07,190
kinds of jobs that could
 

1667
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:10,349
kinds of jobs that could
could not be automated I wonder if

1668
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:10,359
could not be automated I wonder if
 

1669
00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:12,790
could not be automated I wonder if
building infrastructures one of the jobs

1670
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:12,800
building infrastructures one of the jobs
 

1671
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,089
building infrastructures one of the jobs
that would not be easily automated

1672
00:39:15,089 --> 00:39:15,099
that would not be easily automated
 

1673
00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:17,230
that would not be easily automated
something you could think about because

1674
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:17,240
something you could think about because
 

1675
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,819
something you could think about because
they think you mentioned somewhere in

1676
00:39:18,819 --> 00:39:18,829
they think you mentioned somewhere in
 

1677
00:39:18,829 --> 00:39:21,870
they think you mentioned somewhere in
the talk or that there there might be as

1678
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:21,880
the talk or that there there might be as
 

1679
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,790
the talk or that there there might be as
jobs are being automated a role for

1680
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:24,800
jobs are being automated a role for
 

1681
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,859
jobs are being automated a role for
government to create jobs that can't be

1682
00:39:26,859 --> 00:39:26,869
government to create jobs that can't be
 

1683
00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:29,140
government to create jobs that can't be
automated yes I think that's a

1684
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:29,150
automated yes I think that's a
 

1685
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,180
automated yes I think that's a
possibility

1686
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:30,190
possibility
 

1687
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:35,040
possibility
back in the last financial crisis China

1688
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,050
back in the last financial crisis China
 

1689
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:39,490
back in the last financial crisis China
puts a lot of money to basically give

1690
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:39,500
puts a lot of money to basically give
 

1691
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,829
puts a lot of money to basically give
this economy a boost and a lot of it a

1692
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:41,839
this economy a boost and a lot of it a
 

1693
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,930
this economy a boost and a lot of it a
lot of the one into infrastructure

1694
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:43,940
lot of the one into infrastructure
 

1695
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,690
lot of the one into infrastructure
building and and I think that's a

1696
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:46,700
building and and I think that's a
 

1697
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,329
building and and I think that's a
legitimate way and the government level

1698
00:39:49,329 --> 00:39:49,339
legitimate way and the government level
 

1699
00:39:49,339 --> 00:39:54,370
legitimate way and the government level
to to deal with the employment issues as

1700
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:54,380
to to deal with the employment issues as
 

1701
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,859
to to deal with the employment issues as
well as build out the infrastructure as

1702
00:39:56,859 --> 00:39:56,869
well as build out the infrastructure as
 

1703
00:39:56,869 --> 00:39:58,960
well as build out the infrastructure as
long as the infrastructures are truly

1704
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:58,970
long as the infrastructures are truly
 

1705
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:01,120
long as the infrastructures are truly
needed and as long as there isn't an

00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,130
needed and as long as there isn't an
 

1707
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:03,640
needed and as long as there isn't an
employment problem which no we don't

1708
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:03,650
employment problem which no we don't
 

1709
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:06,930
employment problem which no we don't
know so maybe taking a little step back

1710
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:06,940
know so maybe taking a little step back
 

1711
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:11,710
know so maybe taking a little step back
if you've been a leader and a researcher

1715
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:19,690
in AI for several decades at least 30
years so how is AI changed in the west

1716
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:19,700
years so how is AI changed in the west
 

1717
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,880
years so how is AI changed in the west
and the east as you've observed as

00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:21,890
and the east as you've observed as
 

1719
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,859

well a I began as the pursuits of

00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:27,890
well a I began as the pursuits of
 

1725
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:30,760
well a I began as the pursuits of
understanding human intelligence and the

1726
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:30,770
understanding human intelligence and the
 

1727
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:34,720
understanding human intelligence and the
term itself represents that but it kind

1728
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:34,730
term itself represents that but it kind
 

1729
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:37,630

of drifted into the one sub area that

1730
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:37,640
of drifted into the one sub area that
 

1731
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,670
of drifted into the one sub area that
worked extremely well which is machine

1732
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:39,680
worked extremely well which is machine
 

1733
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,220
worked extremely well which is machine
intelligence and that's actually more

1734
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:42,230
intelligence and that's actually more
 

1735
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:45,990

using pattern recognition techniques to
 

1737
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,180
using pattern recognition techniques to
basically do incredibly well on the

00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:55,180
limited or domain large amount of data
but relatively simple kinds of farm

1742
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:55,190
but relatively simple kinds of farm
 

1743
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:58,380
but relatively simple kinds of farm
planning tasks and not very creative so

1744
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:58,390
planning tasks and not very creative so
 

1745
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:01,390
planning tasks and not very creative so
so we didn't end up building human

1746
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:01,400
so we didn't end up building human
 

1747
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,140
so we didn't end up building human
intelligence

1748

we built a different machine that was a

1750
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:04,910
we built a different machine that was a
 

1751
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:08,200
we built a different machine that was a
lot better than us some problems but

1752
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:08,210
lot better than us some problems but
 

1753
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:11,859
lot better than us some problems but
nowhere close to us other problems so

1754
00:41:11,859 --> 00:41:11,869
nowhere close to us other problems so
 

1755
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:14,109
nowhere close to us other problems so
today I think a lot of people still

1756
00:41:14,109 --> 00:41:14,119
today I think a lot of people still
 

1757
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:17,140
today I think a lot of people still

that you're talking about of automating
 

1791
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:57,740
that you're talking about of automating
particular kinds of jobs and you talk

particular kinds of jobs and you talk
 

1793
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:00,319
particular kinds of jobs and you talk
about them in the book so what are the

about them in the book so what are the
 

1795
00:42:00,329 --> 00:42:02,059
about them in the book so what are the
kinds of jobs in your view that you see

this is a also maybe a little bit

1802
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:11,670
this is a also maybe a little bit
 

1803
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:14,180
this is a also maybe a little bit
counterintuitive because it's the

1804
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:14,190
counterintuitive because it's the
 

1805
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:17,210
counterintuitive because it's the

routine jobs that will be displaced the
 

1807
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,940

people think of AI replacing routine
 

1819
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,069

00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,200
line the workers well that will have
some effect but it's actually the

some effect but it's actually the
 

1825
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:44,359
some effect but it's actually the

routine white-collar workers that's
 

1827
00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:48,380
routine white-collar workers that's
easier to replace because to replace the

1828
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:48,390
easier to replace because to replace the
 

1829
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:49,730
easier to replace because to replace the
white-collar worker you just need

white-collar worker you just need
 

1831
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,520
white-collar worker you just need
software to replace a blue-collar worker

1832
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:52,530
software to replace a blue-collar worker
 

1833

workers so I see modest numbers in the
 

1915
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:56,740

2245
00:52:32,339 --> 00:52:35,120

are not likely to be filled so there's

are not likely to be filled so there's
 

2247
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:37,370
are not likely to be filled so there's
likely to be a shortage and the reason

likely to be a shortage and the reason
 

2249
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,230
likely to be a shortage and the reason
they're not filled is simply because

they're not filled is simply because
 

2251
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,559
they're not filled is simply because
they don't pay very well and that the

they don't pay very well and that the
 

2253
00:52:42,569 --> 00:52:46,520

social status of these jobs are not very
 

2255
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:49,750
social status of these jobs are not very
good so they pay about half as much as a

a lot of the worries about more powerful

kinds of scenarios AI can automate and

00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:43,260
kinds of scenarios AI can automate and
 

2555
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:46,670
kinds of scenarios AI can automate and
and and you know animus weapons that

00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:52,490
needs to be controlled somehow and
autonomous decision-making can lead to

2560
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:52,500
autonomous decision-making can lead to
 

2561
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:56,060
autonomous decision-making can lead to
not enough time to fix international

not enough time to fix international

not enough time to fix international
crises so I actually believe a Cold War

01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:00,330
crises so I actually believe a Cold War
 

2565
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:01,630
crises so I actually believe a Cold War
mentality would be very dangerous

2566
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:01,640
mentality would be very dangerous
 

2567
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:05,390
mentality would be very dangerous
because should two countries rely on AI

2568
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:05,400
because should two countries rely on AI
 

2569
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,960
because should two countries rely on AI
to make certain decisions and they don't

2570
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:08,970
to make certain decisions and they don't
 

2571
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:10,490
to make certain decisions and they don't
in talk to each other they do their own

scenario planning then something could

2574
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:13,170
scenario planning then something could
 

2575
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:13,970
scenario planning then something could
easily go wrong

2576
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:13,980
easily go wrong
 

2577
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:17,930
easily go wrong
I think engagement interaction some

2578
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:17,940
I think engagement interaction some
 

2579
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:22,820
I think engagement interaction some
protocols to avoid inadvertent disasters

2580
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:22,830
protocols to avoid inadvertent disasters
 

2581
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:26,750
protocols to avoid inadvertent disasters
is actually needed so it's natural for

2582
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:26,760
is actually needed so it's natural for
 

2583
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,820
is actually needed so it's natural for
each country to want to be the best

2584
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:28,830
each country to want to be the best
 

2585
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:31,780
each country to want to be the best
whether it's in nuclear technologies or

2586
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:31,790
whether it's in nuclear technologies or
 

2587
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:37,040
whether it's in nuclear technologies or
AI or bio but I think is important to

2588
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:37,050
AI or bio but I think is important to
 

2589
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:40,100
AI or bio but I think is important to
realize if each country has a black box

2590
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:40,110
realize if each country has a black box
 

2591
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:42,950
realize if each country has a black box
AI and that don't talk to each other

2592
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:42,960
AI and that don't talk to each other
 

2593
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:46,000
AI and that don't talk to each other
that probably presents greater

2594
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:46,010
that probably presents greater
 

2595
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:49,730
that probably presents greater
challenges to humanity then if they

2596
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:49,740
challenges to humanity then if they
 

2597
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:52,520
challenges to humanity then if they
interacted I think there can still be

2598
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:52,530
interacted I think there can still be
 

2599
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:54,830
interacted I think there can still be
competition but with some degree of

2600
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:54,840
competition but with some degree of
 

2601
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,950
competition but with some degree of
protocol for interaction just like when

2602
01:00:57,950 --> 01:00:57,960
protocol for interaction just like when
 

2603
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:02,300
protocol for interaction just like when
there was a nuclear competition there

2604
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:02,310
there was a nuclear competition there
 

2605
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:05,210
there was a nuclear competition there
were some protocol for deterrence among

2606
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:05,220
were some protocol for deterrence among
 

2607
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:09,200
were some protocol for deterrence among
US Russia and China and I think that

2608
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:09,210
US Russia and China and I think that
 

2609
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:12,230
US Russia and China and I think that
engagement is needed so of course we're

2610
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:12,240
engagement is needed so of course we're
 

2611
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,750
engagement is needed so of course we're
still far from AI presenting that kind

2612
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:14,760
still far from AI presenting that kind
 

2613
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,630
still far from AI presenting that kind
of danger but what I worry the most

2614
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:17,640
of danger but what I worry the most
 

2615
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:18,380
of danger but what I worry the most
about

2616
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:18,390
about
 

2617
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:21,500
about
is the level of engagement seems to be

2618
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:21,510
is the level of engagement seems to be
 

2619
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:24,920
is the level of engagement seems to be
coming down the level of distrust seems

2620
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:24,930
coming down the level of distrust seems
 

2621
01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:27,829
coming down the level of distrust seems
to be going up especially from the US

2622
01:01:27,829 --> 01:01:27,839
to be going up especially from the US
 

2623
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:30,470
to be going up especially from the US
towards other large countries such as

2624
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:30,480
towards other large countries such as
 

2625
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,420
towards other large countries such as
China and of course Russia and Russia

2626
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:32,430
China and of course Russia and Russia
 

2627
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:34,549
China and of course Russia and Russia
yes is there a way to make that better

2628
01:01:34,549 --> 01:01:34,559
yes is there a way to make that better
 

2629
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:36,049
yes is there a way to make that better
so that's beautifully put level

2630
01:01:36,049 --> 01:01:36,059
so that's beautifully put level
 

2631
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:39,230
so that's beautifully put level
engagement and even just basic trust and

2632
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:39,240
engagement and even just basic trust and
 

2633
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:45,440
engagement and even just basic trust and

particular particular countries did you
 

2639
01:01:53,819 --> 01:01:56,089
particular particular countries did you
ever you have a sense how we can make it

2640
01:01:56,089 --> 01:01:56,099
ever you have a sense how we can make it
 

2641
01:01:56,099 --> 01:01:56,650
ever you have a sense how we can make it
better

2642
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:56,660
better
 

2643
01:01:56,660 --> 01:02:00,650
better
mentionable items that as a society we

mentionable items that as a society we
 

2645
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:03,250
mentionable items that as a society we
can take on I'm not an expert at

2647
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:07,250
can take on I'm not an expert at
geopolitics but I would say that we look

2648
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:07,260
geopolitics but I would say that we look
 

2649
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:11,450
geopolitics but I would say that we look
pretty foolish as humankind when we are

01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:11,460
pretty foolish as humankind when we are
 

2651
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:13,519
pretty foolish as humankind when we are

of the world still in poverty and for
 

2661
01:02:30,569 --> 01:02:32,450
of the world still in poverty and for
the first time we have the resources to

the first time we have the resources to
 

2663
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:34,880
the first time we have the resources to
overcome poverty and hunger we're not

overcome poverty and hunger we're not
 

2665
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:36,559
overcome poverty and hunger we're not
using it on that but we're fueling

2666
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:36,569
using it on that but we're fueling
 

2667
01:02:36,569 --> 01:02:39,109
using it on that but we're fueling
competition among superpowers and that's

2668
01:02:39,109 --> 01:02:39,119
competition among superpowers and that's
 

2669
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:43,069
competition among superpowers and that's
a very unfortunate thing if we become

2670
01:02:43,069 --> 01:02:43,079
a very unfortunate thing if we become
 

2671

benevolent world government that has
 

2675
01:02:52,589 --> 01:02:55,519
benevolent world government that has
this 16 trillion dollars and maybe some

this 16 trillion dollars and maybe some
 

2677
01:02:55,529 --> 01:02:57,980
this 16 trillion dollars and maybe some
AI to figure out how to use it to deal

2678
01:02:57,980 --> 01:02:57,990
AI to figure out how to use it to deal
 

2679
01:02:57,990 --> 01:03:01,640
AI to figure out how to use it to deal
with diseases and problems and hate and

2680
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:01,650
with diseases and problems and hate and
 

2681
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:03,260
with diseases and problems and hate and
things like that world would be a lot

2682
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:03,270
things like that world would be a lot
 

2683
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:06,470
things like that world would be a lot
better off so what is wrong with the

2684
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:06,480
better off so what is wrong with the
 

2685
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,900
better off so what is wrong with the
current world I think the people with

2686
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:08,910
current world I think the people with
 

2687
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:12,230
current world I think the people with
more skill than then I should just think

2688
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:12,240
more skill than then I should just think
 

2689
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,900
more skill than then I should just think
about this and then at your politics

2690
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:14,910
about this and then at your politics
 

2691
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:17,329
about this and then at your politics
issue with superpower competition is one

2692
01:03:17,329 --> 01:03:17,339
issue with superpower competition is one
 

2693
01:03:17,339 --> 01:03:20,120
issue with superpower competition is one
side of the issue there's another side

side of the issue there's another side
 

2695
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:23,420
side of the issue there's another side
which I worry maybe even even even more

2696
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:23,430
which I worry maybe even even even more
 

2697
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:27,410
which I worry maybe even even even more
which is as the 16 trillion dollars all

which is as the 16 trillion dollars all
 

2699
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:29,839
which is as the 16 trillion dollars all
gets made by US and China and a few of

the poorer country will get nothing

2704
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:33,620
the poorer country will get nothing
 

2705
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:36,890
the poorer country will get nothing
because they don't have technology and

01:03:36,890 --> 01:03:36,900
because they don't have technology and
 

2707
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:40,250
because they don't have technology and
the the wealth disparity and the end of

the the wealth disparity and the end of
 

2709
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:43,220
the the wealth disparity and the end of
inequality will increase so a poor a

inequality will increase so a poor a

country with a large population will not

country with a large population will not
only benefit from the AI pool or other

only benefit from the AI pool or other
 

2715
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:51,110
only benefit from the AI pool or other
technology booms but they will have

01:03:51,110 --> 01:03:51,120
technology booms but they will have
 

2717

technology booms but they will have
their workers who previously had hoped

2718
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:53,880
their workers who previously had hoped
 

2719
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,300
their workers who previously had hoped
they could do the china model and do

2720
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:56,310
they could do the china model and do
 

2721
01:03:56,310 --> 01:03:58,130
they could do the china model and do
outsourced manufacturing or the india

2722
01:03:58,130 --> 01:03:58,140
outsourced manufacturing or the india
 

2723
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:00,380
outsourced manufacturing or the india
model so they could do the house or some

2724
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:00,390
model so they could do the house or some
 

2725
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:03,260
model so they could do the house or some
process or call center all those jobs

2726
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:03,270
process or call center all those jobs
 

2727
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:04,960
process or call center all those jobs
are going to be gone in 10 or 15 years

2728
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:04,970
are going to be gone in 10 or 15 years
 

2729
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:10,520
are going to be gone in 10 or 15 years
so the the individual citizen may be a

2730
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:10,530
so the the individual citizen may be a
 

2731
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:12,440
so the the individual citizen may be a
net liability I mean financially

2732
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:12,450
net liability I mean financially
 

2733
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:15,620
net liability I mean financially
speaking to a poorer country and not an

2734
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:15,630
speaking to a poorer country and not an
 

2735
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:20,000
speaking to a poorer country and not an
asset to claw itself out of poverty so

2736
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:20,010
asset to claw itself out of poverty so
 

2737
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:23,660
asset to claw itself out of poverty so
in that kind of situation these large

2738
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:23,670
in that kind of situation these large
 

2739
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:26,510
in that kind of situation these large
countries with was not much tech are

2740
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:26,520
countries with was not much tech are
 

2741
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:29,690
countries with was not much tech are
going to be facing a downward spiral and

2742
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:29,700
going to be facing a downward spiral and
 

2743
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:33,560
going to be facing a downward spiral and
it's unclear what could be done and and

2744
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:33,570
it's unclear what could be done and and
 

2745
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:35,240
it's unclear what could be done and and
then when we look back and say there's

2746
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:35,250
then when we look back and say there's
 

2747
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:37,490
then when we look back and say there's
16 trillion dollars being created and

2748
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:37,500
16 trillion dollars being created and
 

2749
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,830
16 trillion dollars being created and
it's all being kept by us China and

2750
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:39,840
it's all being kept by us China and
 

2751
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,200
it's all being kept by us China and
other developed countries it just

2752
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:42,210
other developed countries it just
 

2753
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:44,840
other developed countries it just
doesn't feel right so I hope people who

2754
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:44,850
doesn't feel right so I hope people who
 

2755
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:47,300
doesn't feel right so I hope people who
know about geopolitics can find

2756
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:47,310
know about geopolitics can find
 

2757
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:51,020
know about geopolitics can find
solutions that's beyond my expertise so

2758
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:51,030
solutions that's beyond my expertise so
 

2759
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:52,730
solutions that's beyond my expertise so

different countries that we've talked
 

2761
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:55,370
different countries that we've talked
about have different value systems if

about have different value systems if
 

2763

grow as it does now in its tech
 

2805
01:05:53,970 --> 01:05:57,700

innovation there's a common belief that

2806
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:57,710
innovation there's a common belief that

full freedom of speech and expression is

full freedom of speech and expression is
 

2809
01:06:00,930 --> 01:06:03,260
full freedom of speech and expression is
correlated with creativity which is

correlated with entrepreneurial success
 

2813
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:11,360
correlated with entrepreneurial success
I think empirically we have seen that is

2814
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:11,370
I think empirically we have seen that is
 

2815
01:06:11,370 --> 01:06:15,020
I think empirically we have seen that is
not true and China has been successful

2816
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:15,030
not true and China has been successful

not true and China has been successful
that's not to say the fundamental values

that's not to say the fundamental values
 

2819
01:06:18,030 --> 01:06:21,110
that's not to say the fundamental values
are not right or not the best but it's

2820
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:21,120
are not right or not the best but it's
 

2821
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,510
are not right or not the best but it's
just that that that perfect correlation

2822
01:06:23,510 --> 01:06:23,520
just that that that perfect correlation
 

2823
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:27,800
just that that that perfect correlation
isn't isn't there it's hard to read the

2824
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:27,810
isn't isn't there it's hard to read the
 

2825

tea leaves on an opening up or not in
 

2827
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:33,470
tea leaves on an opening up or not in
any country and I've not been very good

2828
01:06:33,470 --> 01:06:33,480
any country and I've not been very good
 

2829
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:37,970
any country and I've not been very good
at that in my past predictions but I do

2830
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:37,980
at that in my past predictions but I do
 

2831
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:42,320
at that in my past predictions but I do
believe every country shares some

2832
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:42,330
believe every country shares some
 

2833
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:44,750
believe every country shares some
fundamental value a lot of fundamental

fundamental value a lot of fundamental
 

2835
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:48,050
fundamental value a lot of fundamental
values for the long-term so you know

2836
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:48,060
values for the long-term so you know
 

2837
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:52,970
values for the long-term so you know
China is drafting its privacy

2838
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:52,980
China is drafting its privacy
 

2839
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:58,109
China is drafting its privacy
policy for individual citizens and they

2840
01:06:58,109 --> 01:06:58,119
policy for individual citizens and they
 

2841
01:06:58,119 --> 01:07:00,900
policy for individual citizens and they
don't look that different from the

2842
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:00,910
don't look that different from the
 

2843
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:04,410
don't look that different from the
American or European ones so people do

2844
01:07:04,410 --> 01:07:04,420
American or European ones so people do
 

2845
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:08,880
American or European ones so people do
want to protect their privacy and have

2846
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:08,890
want to protect their privacy and have
 

2847
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:12,359
want to protect their privacy and have
the opportunity to express and I think

2848
01:07:12,359 --> 01:07:12,369
the opportunity to express and I think
 

2849
01:07:12,369 --> 01:07:14,220
the opportunity to express and I think
the fundamental values are there the

2850
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:14,230
the fundamental values are there the
 

2851
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:17,120
the fundamental values are there the
question is in the execution and timing

2852
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:17,130
question is in the execution and timing
 

2853
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:20,910
question is in the execution and timing
how soon or when will that start to open

2854
01:07:20,910 --> 01:07:20,920
how soon or when will that start to open
 

2855
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:24,839
how soon or when will that start to open
up so so as long as each government

2856
01:07:24,839 --> 01:07:24,849
up so so as long as each government
 

2857
01:07:24,849 --> 01:07:27,359
up so so as long as each government
knows ultimately people want that kind

2858
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:27,369
knows ultimately people want that kind
 

2859
01:07:27,369 --> 01:07:30,599
knows ultimately people want that kind
of protection there should be a plan to

2860
01:07:30,599 --> 01:07:30,609
of protection there should be a plan to
 

2861
01:07:30,609 --> 01:07:33,960
of protection there should be a plan to
move towards that as to when or how and

2862
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:33,970
move towards that as to when or how and
 

2863
01:07:33,970 --> 01:07:36,780
move towards that as to when or how and
I'm not an expert on the point of

2864
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:36,790
I'm not an expert on the point of
 

2865
01:07:36,790 --> 01:07:39,210
I'm not an expert on the point of
privacy to me it's really interesting so

2866
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:39,220
privacy to me it's really interesting so
 

2867
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:43,200
privacy to me it's really interesting so
AI needs data to create a personalized

2868
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:43,210
AI needs data to create a personalized
 

2869
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:45,569
AI needs data to create a personalized
awesome experience yeah all right I'm

2870
01:07:45,569 --> 01:07:45,579
awesome experience yeah all right I'm
 

2871
01:07:45,579 --> 01:07:46,950
awesome experience yeah all right I'm
just speaking general in terms of

2872
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:46,960
just speaking general in terms of
 

2873
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,859
just speaking general in terms of
products and then we have currently

2874
01:07:49,859 --> 01:07:49,869
products and then we have currently
 

2875
01:07:49,869 --> 01:07:51,839
products and then we have currently
depending on the age and depending on

2876
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:51,849
depending on the age and depending on
 

2877
01:07:51,849 --> 01:07:53,490
depending on the age and depending on
the demographics of who we were talking

2878
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:53,500
the demographics of who we were talking
 

2879
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:54,960
the demographics of who we were talking
about some people are more or less

2880
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:54,970
about some people are more or less
 

2881
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:57,990
about some people are more or less
concerned about the amount of data they

2882
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:58,000
concerned about the amount of data they
 

2883
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,980
concerned about the amount of data they
handover so in your view how do we get

2884
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:01,990
handover so in your view how do we get
 

2885
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:05,579
handover so in your view how do we get
this balance right that we provide an

2886
01:08:05,579 --> 01:08:05,589
this balance right that we provide an
 

2887
01:08:05,589 --> 01:08:08,640
this balance right that we provide an
amazing experience to people that use

2888
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:08,650
amazing experience to people that use
 

2889
01:08:08,650 --> 01:08:11,789
amazing experience to people that use
products you look at Facebook you know

2890
01:08:11,789 --> 01:08:11,799
products you look at Facebook you know
 

2891
01:08:11,799 --> 01:08:13,740
products you look at Facebook you know
the more Facebook knows about you yes

2892
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:13,750
the more Facebook knows about you yes
 

2893
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:17,099
the more Facebook knows about you yes
it's scary to say the better you can

2894
01:08:17,099 --> 01:08:17,109
it's scary to say the better you can
 

2895
01:08:17,109 --> 01:08:20,160
it's scary to say the better you can
probably yeah but experience it could

2896
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:20,170
probably yeah but experience it could
 

2897
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:22,140
probably yeah but experience it could
probably create so any of you how do we

2898
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:22,150
probably create so any of you how do we
 

2899
01:08:22,150 --> 01:08:27,479
probably create so any of you how do we
get that balance right yes I think a lot

2900
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:27,489
get that balance right yes I think a lot
 

2901
01:08:27,489 --> 01:08:30,439
get that balance right yes I think a lot
of people have a misunderstanding that

2902
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:30,449
of people have a misunderstanding that
 

2903
01:08:30,449 --> 01:08:33,809
of people have a misunderstanding that
it's okay and possible to just rip all

2904
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:33,819
it's okay and possible to just rip all
 

2905
01:08:33,819 --> 01:08:37,470
it's okay and possible to just rip all
the data out from a provider and give it

2906
01:08:37,470 --> 01:08:37,480
the data out from a provider and give it
 

2907
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,840
the data out from a provider and give it
back to you so you can deny them access

2908
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:39,850
back to you so you can deny them access
 

2909
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:42,599
back to you so you can deny them access
to further data and still enjoy the

2910
01:08:42,599 --> 01:08:42,609
to further data and still enjoy the
 

2911
01:08:42,609 --> 01:08:45,360
to further data and still enjoy the
services we have if we take back all the

2912
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:45,370
services we have if we take back all the
 

2913
01:08:45,370 --> 01:08:47,459
services we have if we take back all the
data all the services will give us

2914
01:08:47,459 --> 01:08:47,469
data all the services will give us
 

2915
01:08:47,469 --> 01:08:50,150
data all the services will give us
nonsense will no longer be able to use

2916
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:50,160
nonsense will no longer be able to use
 

2917
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:52,979
nonsense will no longer be able to use
products that function well in terms of

2918
01:08:52,979 --> 01:08:52,989
products that function well in terms of
 

2919
01:08:52,989 --> 01:08:56,010
products that function well in terms of
you know right ranking right products

2920
01:08:56,010 --> 01:08:56,020
you know right ranking right products
 

2921
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:59,669
you know right ranking right products
right user experience so so yet I do

2922
01:08:59,669 --> 01:08:59,679
right user experience so so yet I do
 

2923
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:02,340
right user experience so so yet I do
understand we don't want to permit

2924
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:02,350
understand we don't want to permit
 

2925
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:06,780
understand we don't want to permit
misuse of the data from legal policy

2926
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:06,790
misuse of the data from legal policy
 

2927
01:09:06,790 --> 01:09:10,170
misuse of the data from legal policy
and point I think there can be severe

2928
01:09:10,170 --> 01:09:10,180
and point I think there can be severe
 

2929
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:14,000
and point I think there can be severe
punishment for those who have egregious

2930
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:14,010
punishment for those who have egregious
 

2931
01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:18,660
punishment for those who have egregious
misuse of the data that's I think a good

2932
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:18,670
misuse of the data that's I think a good
 

2933
01:09:18,670 --> 01:09:19,470
misuse of the data that's I think a good
first step

2934
01:09:19,470 --> 01:09:19,480
first step
 

2935
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:22,110
first step
actually China in this side on this

2936
01:09:22,110 --> 01:09:22,120
actually China in this side on this
 

2937
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:25,079
actually China in this side on this
aspect has very strong laws about people

2938
01:09:25,079 --> 01:09:25,089
aspect has very strong laws about people
 

2939
01:09:25,089 --> 01:09:27,510
aspect has very strong laws about people
who sell or give data to other companies

2940
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:27,520
who sell or give data to other companies
 

2941
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:29,910
who sell or give data to other companies
and and that over the past few years

2942
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:29,920
and and that over the past few years
 

2943
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,789
and and that over the past few years
since the that loud locking came into

2944
01:09:32,789 --> 01:09:32,799
since the that loud locking came into
 

2945
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:33,450
since the that loud locking came into
effect

2946
01:09:33,450 --> 01:09:33,460
effect
 

2947
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:37,950
effect
pretty much eradicated the illegal

2948
01:09:37,950 --> 01:09:37,960
pretty much eradicated the illegal
 

2949
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:40,670
pretty much eradicated the illegal
distribution sharing of data

2950
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:40,680
distribution sharing of data
 

2951
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:47,150

additionally I think giving I think in

2952
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:47,160
additionally I think giving I think in
 

2953
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:50,190
additionally I think giving I think in
technology is often a very good way to

2954
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:50,200
technology is often a very good way to
 

2955
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:54,270
technology is often a very good way to
solve technology misuse so can we come

2956
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:54,280
solve technology misuse so can we come
 

2957
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:56,910
solve technology misuse so can we come
up with new technologies that will let

2958
01:09:56,910 --> 01:09:56,920
up with new technologies that will let
 

2959
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,530
up with new technologies that will let
us have our cake and eat it too

2960
01:09:58,530 --> 01:09:58,540
us have our cake and eat it too
 

2961
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:00,780
us have our cake and eat it too
people are looking into homomorphic

2962
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:00,790
people are looking into homomorphic
 

2963
01:10:00,790 --> 01:10:04,020
people are looking into homomorphic
encryption which is letting you keep the

2964
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:04,030
encryption which is letting you keep the
 

2965
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:06,240
encryption which is letting you keep the
data have it encrypted and train on

2966
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:06,250
data have it encrypted and train on
 

2967
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:08,010
data have it encrypted and train on
encrypted data of course we haven't

2968
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:08,020
encrypted data of course we haven't
 

2969
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:10,410
encrypted data of course we haven't
solved that one yet but that kind of

2970
01:10:10,410 --> 01:10:10,420
solved that one yet but that kind of
 

2971
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:13,260
solved that one yet but that kind of
direction may be worth pursuing

2972
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:13,270
direction may be worth pursuing
 

2973
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:15,660
direction may be worth pursuing
also federated learning which would

2974
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:15,670
also federated learning which would
 

2975
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:18,060
also federated learning which would
allow one hospital to train on its

2976
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:18,070
allow one hospital to train on its
 

2977
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:20,430
allow one hospital to train on its
hospital's patient data fully because

2978
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:20,440
hospital's patient data fully because
 

2979
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,860
hospital's patient data fully because
they have a license for that and then

2980
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:22,870
they have a license for that and then
 

2981
01:10:22,870 --> 01:10:24,750
they have a license for that and then
hospitals would then share their models

2982
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:24,760
hospitals would then share their models
 

2983
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,120
hospitals would then share their models
not data with models to create a super

2984
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:27,130
not data with models to create a super
 

2985
01:10:27,130 --> 01:10:30,000
not data with models to create a super
AI and that also maybe has some promise

2986
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:30,010
AI and that also maybe has some promise
 

2987
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:33,240
AI and that also maybe has some promise
so I would want to encourage us to be

2988
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:33,250
so I would want to encourage us to be
 

2989
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:35,880
so I would want to encourage us to be
open-minded and think this think of this

2990
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:35,890
open-minded and think this think of this
 

2991
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:39,870
open-minded and think this think of this
as not just the policy binary yes/no but

2992
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:39,880
as not just the policy binary yes/no but
 

2993
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:41,850
as not just the policy binary yes/no but
letting the technologists try to find

2994
01:10:41,850 --> 01:10:41,860
letting the technologists try to find
 

2995
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:44,280
letting the technologists try to find
solutions to let us have our cake in

2996
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:44,290
solutions to let us have our cake in
 

2997
01:10:44,290 --> 01:10:46,170
solutions to let us have our cake in
either two or have most of our cake and

2998
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:46,180
either two or have most of our cake and
 

2999
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:47,960
either two or have most of our cake and
eat most of it too

3000
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:47,970
eat most of it too
 

3001
01:10:47,970 --> 01:10:50,760
eat most of it too
finally I think giving each end user a

3002
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:50,770
finally I think giving each end user a
 

3003
01:10:50,770 --> 01:10:53,340
finally I think giving each end user a
choice is important and having

3004
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:53,350
choice is important and having
 

3005
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:56,070
choice is important and having
transparency is important also I think

3006
01:10:56,070 --> 01:10:56,080
transparency is important also I think
 

3007
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:59,580
transparency is important also I think
that's universal but the choice you give

3008
01:10:59,580 --> 01:10:59,590
that's universal but the choice you give
 

3009
01:10:59,590 --> 01:11:01,620
that's universal but the choice you give
to the user should not be at a granular

3010
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:01,630
to the user should not be at a granular
 

3011
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:04,310
to the user should not be at a granular
level that the user cannot understand

3012
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:04,320
level that the user cannot understand
 

3013
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:08,180
level that the user cannot understand

about is there a way to fit the spirit
 

3043

3368
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:52,880
what lessons should we take this deeper
 

3369

what lessons should we take this deeper
because Eve accomplished incredible

3370

because Eve accomplished incredible

because Eve accomplished incredible
things you say it chasing numbers but

3372
01:19:57,340 --> 01:19:57,350
things you say it chasing numbers but
 

3373
01:19:57,350 --> 01:19:59,740
things you say it chasing numbers but
really there's some incredible work

3374
01:19:59,740 --> 01:19:59,750
really there's some incredible work
 

3375
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:03,730
really there's some incredible work
there so how do you think about that

3376
01:20:03,730 --> 01:20:03,740
there so how do you think about that
 

3377
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:07,390
there so how do you think about that
when you look back in your 20s 30s what

3378
01:20:07,390 --> 01:20:07,400
when you look back in your 20s 30s what
 

3379
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:10,210
when you look back in your 20s 30s what
was what would you do differently would

3380
01:20:10,210 --> 01:20:10,220
was what would you do differently would
 

3381
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:13,210
was what would you do differently would
you really take back some of the

3382
01:20:13,210 --> 01:20:13,220
you really take back some of the
 

3383
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:14,640
you really take back some of the
incredible hard work

3384
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:14,650
incredible hard work
 

3385
01:20:14,650 --> 01:20:18,780
incredible hard work
I would but it's it's in percentages

3386
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:18,790
I would but it's it's in percentages
 

3387
01:20:18,790 --> 01:20:19,530
I would but it's it's in percentages
right

3388
01:20:19,530 --> 01:20:19,540
right
 

3389
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:23,250
right
we're both computer scientists so I

3390
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:23,260
we're both computer scientists so I
 

3391
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:25,800
we're both computer scientists so I
think when one balances one's life when

3392
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:25,810
think when one balances one's life when
 

3393
01:20:25,810 --> 01:20:29,040
think when one balances one's life when
when one is younger you you might give a

3394
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:29,050
when one is younger you you might give a
 

3395
01:20:29,050 --> 01:20:31,620
when one is younger you you might give a
smaller percentage to family but you

3396
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:31,630
smaller percentage to family but you
 

3397
01:20:31,630 --> 01:20:33,180
smaller percentage to family but you
will still give him high priority and

3398
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:33,190
will still give him high priority and
 

3399
01:20:33,190 --> 01:20:35,310
will still give him high priority and
when you get older you would give a

3400
01:20:35,310 --> 01:20:35,320
when you get older you would give a
 

3401
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:37,260
when you get older you would give a
larger percentage to them and still the

3402
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:37,270
larger percentage to them and still the
 

3403
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:40,050
larger percentage to them and still the
high priority and and when you're near

3404
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:40,060
high priority and and when you're near
 

3405
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:41,910
high priority and and when you're near
retirement you give most of it to them

3406
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:41,920
retirement you give most of it to them
 

3407
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,430
retirement you give most of it to them
and the highest priority so I think the

3408
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:44,440
and the highest priority so I think the
 

3409
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:48,660
and the highest priority so I think the
key point is not that we would work 20

3410
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:48,670
key point is not that we would work 20
 

3411
01:20:48,670 --> 01:20:51,030
key point is not that we would work 20
hours less for the whole life and just

3412
01:20:51,030 --> 01:20:51,040
hours less for the whole life and just
 

3413
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:54,060
hours less for the whole life and just
spend it aimlessly with the family but

3414
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:54,070
spend it aimlessly with the family but
 

3415
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:57,830
spend it aimlessly with the family but
that when the family has a need when

3416
01:20:57,830 --> 01:20:57,840
that when the family has a need when
 

3417
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,600
that when the family has a need when
your wife is having a baby when your

3418
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:00,610
your wife is having a baby when your
 

3419
01:21:00,610 --> 01:21:04,109
your wife is having a baby when your
daughter has a birthday or when they're

01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:08,290
something or when they have a
 

3425
01:21:08,290 --> 01:21:11,030
something or when they have a
get-together or we have family time that

3426
01:21:11,030 --> 01:21:11,040
get-together or we have family time that
 

3427
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,620
get-together or we have family time that
it's important for us to put down our

3428
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:13,630
it's important for us to put down our
 

3429
01:21:13,630 --> 01:21:16,290
it's important for us to put down our
phone and PC and be a hundred percent

3430
01:21:16,290 --> 01:21:16,300
phone and PC and be a hundred percent
 

3431
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:21,839
phone and PC and be a hundred percent
with them and that priority on the

3432
01:21:21,839 --> 01:21:21,849
with them and that priority on the
 

3433
01:21:21,849 --> 01:21:24,390
with them and that priority on the
things that really matter isn't going to

3434
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:24,400
things that really matter isn't going to
 

3435
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:29,189
things that really matter isn't going to
be so taxing that it would eliminate or

3436
01:21:29,189 --> 01:21:29,199
be so taxing that it would eliminate or
 

3437
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:30,750
be so taxing that it would eliminate or
even dramatically reduce our

3438
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:30,760
even dramatically reduce our
 

3439
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,939
even dramatically reduce our
accomplishments it might have some

3440
01:21:32,939 --> 01:21:32,949
accomplishments it might have some
 

3441
01:21:32,949 --> 01:21:35,310
accomplishments it might have some
impact but it might also have other

3442
01:21:35,310 --> 01:21:35,320
impact but it might also have other
 

3443
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:37,140
impact but it might also have other
impact because if you have a happier

3444
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:37,150
impact because if you have a happier
 

3445
01:21:37,150 --> 01:21:39,689
impact because if you have a happier
family maybe you fight less you fight

3446
01:21:39,689 --> 01:21:39,699
family maybe you fight less you fight
 

3447
01:21:39,699 --> 01:21:42,959
family maybe you fight less you fight
less you don't spend time taking care of

3448
01:21:42,959 --> 01:21:42,969
less you don't spend time taking care of
 

3449
01:21:42,969 --> 01:21:45,839
less you don't spend time taking care of
all the aftermath of a fight so it's

3450
01:21:45,839 --> 01:21:45,849
all the aftermath of a fight so it's
 

3451
01:21:45,849 --> 01:21:48,300
all the aftermath of a fight so it's
unclear that it would take more time and

3452
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:48,310
unclear that it would take more time and
 

3453
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:51,870
unclear that it would take more time and
if it did I'd be willing to to take that

3454
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:51,880
if it did I'd be willing to to take that
 

3455
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:54,870
if it did I'd be willing to to take that
reduction and it's not a dramatic number

3456
01:21:54,870 --> 01:21:54,880
reduction and it's not a dramatic number
 

3457
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:57,209
reduction and it's not a dramatic number
but it's a number that I think would

3458
01:21:57,209 --> 01:21:57,219
but it's a number that I think would
 

3459
01:21:57,219 --> 01:21:59,629
but it's a number that I think would
give me a greater degree of happiness

3460
01:21:59,629 --> 01:21:59,639
give me a greater degree of happiness
 

3461
01:21:59,639 --> 01:22:02,189
give me a greater degree of happiness
and knowing that I've done the right

and knowing that I've done the right
 

3463
01:22:02,199 --> 01:22:06,270
and knowing that I've done the right
thing and still have plenty of hours to

the scarcity question of AI talent has

3560
01:24:29,529 --> 01:24:29,539
the scarcity question of AI talent has
 

3561
01:24:29,539 --> 01:24:31,929
the scarcity question of AI talent has
changed the number of AI talent has

3562

changed the number of AI talent has
 

3563
01:24:31,939 --> 01:24:35,229
changed the number of AI talent has
changed so now you need not just AI but

3564
01:24:35,229 --> 01:24:35,239
changed so now you need not just AI but
 

3565
01:24:35,239 --> 01:24:38,320
changed so now you need not just AI but
also understanding of business

customer and and the marketplace so I

3568
01:24:42,730 --> 01:24:42,740
customer and and the marketplace so I
 

3569
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:46,510
customer and and the marketplace so I
also think you should have a more

3570
01:24:46,510 --> 01:24:46,520
also think you should have a more
 

3571
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:50,230
also think you should have a more
reasonable valuation expectation and

3572
01:24:50,230 --> 01:24:50,240
reasonable valuation expectation and
 

3573
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:52,780
reasonable valuation expectation and
growth expectation there's going to be

3574

growth expectation there's going to be
 

3575
01:24:52,790 --> 01:24:54,670
growth expectation there's going to be
more competition but the good news

3576

more competition but the good news
 

3577

to use so you should be able to
 

3585
01:25:09,130 --> 01:25:12,070
to use so you should be able to
