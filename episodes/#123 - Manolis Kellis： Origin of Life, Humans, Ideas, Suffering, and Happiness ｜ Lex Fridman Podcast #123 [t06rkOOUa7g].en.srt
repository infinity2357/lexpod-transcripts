have we have about
 

435
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,749
have we have about
30 trillion cells in your body if you

436
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:13,759
30 trillion cells in your body if you
 

437
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,589
30 trillion cells in your body if you
stretch the dna the 2 meters worth of

441
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,189

a hundred times yeah it's all curled up

446
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:27,759
a hundred times yeah it's all curled up
 

447
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,390
a hundred times yeah it's all curled up
in there

448
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,400
in there
 

449
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,830
in there
it's 30 trillion cells 30 trillion

450
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:31,840
it's 30 trillion cells 30 trillion
 

451
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,510
it's 30 trillion cells 30 trillion
human body every one of them two meters

452
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
human body every one of them two meters
 

453
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,950
human body every one of them two meters
worth of dna so

454
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:34,960
worth of dna so
 

455
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,350
worth of dna so
all of that is compacted through the

456
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,360
all of that is compacted through the
 

457
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,390
all of that is compacted through the
epigenome

458
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,400
epigenome
 

459
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,790
epigenome
the epigenome basically has the ability

460
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800
the epigenome basically has the ability
 

461
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,830
the epigenome basically has the ability
to compact

462
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:41,840
to compact
 

463
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,710
to compact
this massive amount of dna from here to

464
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:44,720
this massive amount of dna from here to
 

465
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,110
this massive amount of dna from here to
jupiter 10 times into one human body

466
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,120
jupiter 10 times into one human body
 

467
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,589
jupiter 10 times into one human body
into just the nuclei of one human body

468
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:49,599
into just the nuclei of one human body
 

469
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,029
into just the nuclei of one human body
and the vast majority of human bodies

470
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:51,039
and the vast majority of human bodies
 

471
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,589
and the vast majority of human bodies
not even

472
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:51,599
not even
 

473
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,230
not even
these nuclei and that's sort of the

474
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,240
these nuclei and that's sort of the
 

475
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,270
these nuclei and that's sort of the
structural part

476
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,280
structural part
 

477
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,550
structural part
so that's the boring part that's the

478
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
so that's the boring part that's the
 

479
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,790
so that's the boring part that's the
structural part the functional part

480
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:58,800
structural part the functional part
 

481
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,670
structural part the functional part
is way more interesting so functionally

482
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:01,680
is way more interesting so functionally
 

483
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,430
is way more interesting so functionally
what the human epigenome allows you to

484
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:03,440
what the human epigenome allows you to
 

485
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,469
what the human epigenome allows you to
do

486
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:04,479
do
 

487
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,510
do
is basically control the

488
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:07,520
is basically control the
 

489
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,110
is basically control the
activity patterns of thousands of genes

490
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,120
activity patterns of thousands of genes
 

491
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,589
activity patterns of thousands of genes
so 20 000 genes in your human body every

492
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:13,599
so 20 000 genes in your human body every
 

493
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,189
so 20 000 genes in your human body every
one of your cells only needs

494
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:15,199
one of your cells only needs
 

495
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,790
one of your cells only needs
a few thousand of those but a different

496
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:16,800
a few thousand of those but a different
 

497
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,950
a few thousand of those but a different
few thousand of those and the way that

498
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:18,960
few thousand of those and the way that
 

499
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,629
few thousand of those and the way that
your cells remember

500
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
your cells remember
 

501
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,189
your cells remember
what their identity is is basically

502
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:23,199
what their identity is is basically
 

503
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,070
what their identity is is basically
driven

504
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,080
driven
 

505
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,710
driven
by the epigenome so the epidural is both

506
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:26,720
by the epigenome so the epidural is both
 

507
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,589
by the epigenome so the epidural is both
structural

508
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:27,599
structural
 

509
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:28,950
structural
in sort of making this dramatic

510
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:28,960
in sort of making this dramatic
 

511
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,830
in sort of making this dramatic
compaction and it's also functional

512
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:31,840
compaction and it's also functional
 

513
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,909
compaction and it's also functional
in being able to actually control the

514
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:33,919
in being able to actually control the
 

515
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,269
in being able to actually control the
activity patterns

516
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:35,279
activity patterns
 

517
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,029
activity patterns
of all your cells now can we draw

518
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039
of all your cells now can we draw
 

519
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,670
of all your cells now can we draw
a definition distinction between the

520
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:41,680
a definition distinction between the
 

521
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,589
a definition distinction between the
genome and the epigenome

522
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:43,599
genome and the epigenome
 

523
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,949
genome and the epigenome
again being greek epi means on top of

524
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:46,959
again being greek epi means on top of
 

525
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,949
again being greek epi means on top of
so the genome is the dna

526
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959
so the genome is the dna
 

527
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,949
so the genome is the dna
and the epigenome is anything on top of

528
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:52,959
and the epigenome is anything on top of
 

529
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,389
and the epigenome is anything on top of
the dna

530
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:54,399
the dna
 

531
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,070
the dna
and there's you know three types of

532
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,080
and there's you know three types of
 

533
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,509
and there's you know three types of
things on top of the dna

534
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:57,519
things on top of the dna
 

535
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,430
things on top of the dna
the first is chemical modifications on

536
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,440
the first is chemical modifications on
 

537
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,949
the first is chemical modifications on
the dna itself

538
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959
the dna itself
 

539
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,870
the dna itself
so we like to think of four bases of the

540
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:02,880
so we like to think of four bases of the
 

541
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,630
so we like to think of four bases of the
dna acgt

542
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:04,640
dna acgt
 

543
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,750
dna acgt
c has a methyl form which is sometimes

544
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:07,760
c has a methyl form which is sometimes
 

545
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,350
c has a methyl form which is sometimes
referred to as the fifth base

546
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:09,360
referred to as the fifth base
 

547
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,710
referred to as the fifth base
so methylc takes a different meaning

548
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:12,720
so methylc takes a different meaning
 

549
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,509
so methylc takes a different meaning
so in the same way that you have

550
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:15,519
so in the same way that you have
 

551
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,470
so in the same way that you have
annotations

552
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:16,480
annotations
 

553
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,030
annotations
in a orchestra score that basically say

554
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,040
in a orchestra score that basically say
 

555
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,630
in a orchestra score that basically say
whether you should play something softly

556
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:20,640
whether you should play something softly
 

557
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,630
whether you should play something softly
or loudly or space it out or you know

558
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:24,640
or loudly or space it out or you know
 

559
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,269
or loudly or space it out or you know
interpret basically the score the human

560
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:27,279
interpret basically the score the human
 

561
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,590
interpret basically the score the human
epigenome allows you to modify

562
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:29,600
epigenome allows you to modify
 

563
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,630
epigenome allows you to modify
that primary score so a modified c

564
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,640
that primary score so a modified c
 

565
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,910
that primary score so a modified c
basically says play this one softly it's

566
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:35,920
basically says play this one softly it's
 

567
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,829
basically says play this one softly it's
basically a sign of repression

568
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:37,839
basically a sign of repression
 

569
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,110
basically a sign of repression
in a gene regulatory region i love how

00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,120
in a gene regulatory region i love how

00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:43,760
you're talking about the function that
 

573
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,630
you're talking about the function that
emerges

575
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,470
emerges
from the epigenome as a musical score

it's like having all of human knowledge
in 23 volumes like 23 giant books which

and they're looking at chapter seven

598
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:07,279
and they're looking at chapter seven
 

599
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,509
and they're looking at chapter seven
from chromosome 23 and chapter four from

00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:14,560
and each of those uh
 

605
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,190

pieces are all encoding in the same dna
 

607
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,670
pieces are all encoding in the same dna
but what the epigenome allows you to do

608
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:19,680
but what the epigenome allows you to do
 

609
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,430
but what the epigenome allows you to do
is effectively conduct the orchestra

610
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:23,440
is effectively conduct the orchestra
 

611
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,590
is effectively conduct the orchestra
and sort of coordinate the pieces so

612
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:25,600
and sort of coordinate the pieces so
 

613
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,269
and sort of coordinate the pieces so
that every instrument plays only the

one thing that kind of blows my mind
 

619
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,150
one thing that kind of blows my mind
maybe you can

620
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,160
maybe you can
 

621
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,550
maybe you can
tell me your thoughts about it is the

622
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,560
tell me your thoughts about it is the
 

623
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,310
tell me your thoughts about it is the
the way evolution works with natural

624
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:36,320
the way evolution works with natural
 

625

selection
 

627
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,710

00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:40,720
is uh based on the final sort of
 

629
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,750
is uh based on the final sort of
the entirety of the orchestra

the entirety of the orchestra
 

631
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,790
the entirety of the orchestra
musical performance right and then but

632
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:46,800
musical performance right and then but
 

633
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,550
musical performance right and then but
there's these

634
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:48,560
there's these
 

635
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,150
there's these
incredibly rich structural things

636
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,160
incredibly rich structural things
 

637
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,590
incredibly rich structural things
like each one of them doing their own

638
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:53,600
like each one of them doing their own
 

639
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,069
like each one of them doing their own
little job that somehow work together

640
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:56,079
little job that somehow work together
 

641
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:56,470
little job that somehow work together
like

642
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:56,480
like
 

643
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,550
like
the evolution selects based on the final

644
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:58,560
the evolution selects based on the final
 

645
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,509
the evolution selects based on the final

647
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,750

and yet all the individual pieces are

648
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:01,760
and yet all the individual pieces are
 

649
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,509
and yet all the individual pieces are
doing like infinitely

650
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:03,519
doing like infinitely
 

651
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,310
doing like infinitely
minuscule specific things how the heck

652
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:06,320
minuscule specific things how the heck
 

653
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,030
minuscule specific things how the heck
does that work

654
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
does that work
 

655
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,430
does that work
right it's a very good insight and you

656
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:09,440
right it's a very good insight and you
 

657
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,710
right it's a very good insight and you
can even go beyond that

658
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:10,720
can even go beyond that
 

659
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,230
can even go beyond that
and basically say evolution doesn't

660
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
and basically say evolution doesn't
 

661
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,990
and basically say evolution doesn't
select at the level of

662
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
select at the level of
 

663
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,670
select at the level of
an organism it actually selects at the

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,110
ecosystems
so let me break this down so you

670
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,120
so let me break this down so you
 

671
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,150
so let me break this down so you
basically have

672
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,160
basically have
 

673
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,310
basically have
at the very bottom every single

674
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:24,320
at the very bottom every single
 

675
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,509
at the very bottom every single
nucleotide

676
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:25,519
nucleotide
 

677
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,389
nucleotide
being selected but then that nucleotides

678
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:28,399
being selected but then that nucleotides
 

679
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,829
being selected but then that nucleotides
function is selected

680
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:29,839
function is selected
 

681
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,190
function is selected
at the level of you know each gene

682
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,200
at the level of you know each gene
 

683
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,389
at the level of you know each gene
and every not even its gene each

684
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:36,399
and every not even its gene each
 

685
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,630
and every not even its gene each
gene regulatory control element and then

686
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:38,640
gene regulatory control element and then
 

687
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,069
gene regulatory control element and then
those control elements are basically

688
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:40,079
those control elements are basically
 

689
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,269
those control elements are basically
converging

690
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:41,279
converging
 

691
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,350
converging
onto the function of the gene and many

692
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360
onto the function of the gene and many
 

693
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,790
onto the function of the gene and many
genes are converging onto the function

694
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:44,800
genes are converging onto the function
 

695
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,829
genes are converging onto the function
of one cell

696
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:45,839
of one cell
 

697
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,430
of one cell
and many cells are converging into the

698
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:47,440
and many cells are converging into the
 

699
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,230
and many cells are converging into the
function of one tissue or organ

700
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
function of one tissue or organ
 

701
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,470
function of one tissue or organ
and all of these organs are converging

702
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:52,480
and all of these organs are converging
 

703
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,509
and all of these organs are converging
onto the level

704
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:53,519
onto the level
 

705
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,230
onto the level
of an organism but now that organism is

706
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,240
of an organism but now that organism is
 

707
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,430
of an organism but now that organism is
not in isolation

708
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:57,440
not in isolation
 

709
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,550
not in isolation
so if you basically think about why is

710
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:00,560
so if you basically think about why is
 

711
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,910
so if you basically think about why is
altruism for example

712
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920
altruism for example
 

713
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,910
altruism for example
a thing why are people being nice to

714
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:03,920
a thing why are people being nice to
 

715
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,430
a thing why are people being nice to
each other

716
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:05,440
each other
 

717
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,190
each other
it was probably selected and it was

718
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,200
it was probably selected and it was
 

719
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,829
it was probably selected and it was
probably selected

720
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:08,839
probably selected
 

721
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,590
probably selected
because those species that were just

722
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:11,600
because those species that were just
 

723
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,629
because those species that were just
nasty to each other

724
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:12,639
nasty to each other
 

725
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,750
nasty to each other
didn't survive as a species and now if

726
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:15,760
didn't survive as a species and now if
 

727
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,110
didn't survive as a species and now if
you think about

728
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,120
you think about
 

729
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,550
you think about
um symbiosis

730
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:20,560
um symbiosis
 

731
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,829
um symbiosis
of you know there's plants for example

732
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:23,839
of you know there's plants for example
 

733
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,190
of you know there's plants for example
that love co2

734
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,200
that love co2
 

735
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,350
that love co2
and there's humans that love o2 and

736
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,360
and there's humans that love o2 and
 

737
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,949
and there's humans that love o2 and
we're sort of you know

738
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:28,959
we're sort of you know
 

739
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,310
we're sort of you know
trading different types of

740
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:32,320
trading different types of
 

741
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,350
trading different types of
gases to each other if you look at

742
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,360
gases to each other if you look at
 

743
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,150
gases to each other if you look at
ecosystems where one organism which is

744
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,160
ecosystems where one organism which is
 

745
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,990
ecosystems where one organism which is
really nasty

746
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,000
really nasty
 

747
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,150
really nasty
that organism actually died because

748
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160
that organism actually died because
 

749
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,670
that organism actually died because
everyone they were being nasty to was

750
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:45,680
everyone they were being nasty to was
 

751
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,870
everyone they were being nasty to was
killed off

752
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:46,880
killed off
 

753
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,710
killed off
and then that kind of you know

754
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:50,720
and then that kind of you know
 

755
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,829
and then that kind of you know
universe of life is gone so basically

756
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:53,839
universe of life is gone so basically
 

757
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:54,870
universe of life is gone so basically
what emerges

758
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:54,880
what emerges
 

759
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,949
what emerges
is selection at so many different layers

760
00:12:58,949 --> 00:12:58,959
is selection at so many different layers
 

761
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,389
is selection at so many different layers
of benefit including

762
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:02,399
of benefit including
 

763
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,629
of benefit including
you know all of these nucleotides within

764
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:04,639
you know all of these nucleotides within
 

765
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,829
you know all of these nucleotides within
a body

766
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:05,839
a body
 

767
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,949
a body
interacting for the emergent functions

768
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:08,959
interacting for the emergent functions
 

769
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,190
interacting for the emergent functions
at the body level yeah i wonder i wonder

770
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,200
at the body level yeah i wonder i wonder
 

771
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,870
at the body level yeah i wonder i wonder
if it's possible to break it down into

772
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:12,880
if it's possible to break it down into
 

773
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,750
if it's possible to break it down into
levels that's

774
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:13,760
levels that's
 

775
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,870
levels that's
selection even beyond humans like you

776
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:16,880
selection even beyond humans like you
 

777
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,230
selection even beyond humans like you
said environment but there's

778
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:18,240
said environment but there's
 

779
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,910
said environment but there's
environments at all different levels too

780
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:19,920
environments at all different levels too
 

781
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,350
environments at all different levels too
right

782
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:21,360
right
 

783
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,110
right
at the minuscule at the organ level the

784
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,120
at the minuscule at the organ level the
 

785
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,710
at the minuscule at the organ level the
tissue level like you said

786
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
tissue level like you said
 

787
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,230
tissue level like you said
maybe at the microscopic level it would

788
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:26,240
maybe at the microscopic level it would
 

789
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,910
maybe at the microscopic level it would
be fascinating if like

790
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:27,920
be fascinating if like
 

791
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,629
be fascinating if like
there's a kind of selection going on at

792
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:30,639
there's a kind of selection going on at
 

793
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:30,949
there's a kind of selection going on at
like

794
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:30,959
like
 

795
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,310
like
both the quantum level and like the

796
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
both the quantum level and like the
 

797
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,710
both the quantum level and like the
the galaxy level yeah yeah right yeah so

798
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:36,720
the galaxy level yeah yeah right yeah so
 

799
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,150
the galaxy level yeah yeah right yeah so
so all the different forms

800
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
so all the different forms
 

801
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,590
so all the different forms
yeah let's again sort of break down

802
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:39,600
yeah let's again sort of break down
 

803
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,949
yeah let's again sort of break down
these different layers so basically if

804
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:40,959
these different layers so basically if
 

805
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,470
these different layers so basically if
you think about the environment

806
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:42,480
you think about the environment
 

807
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,870
you think about the environment
in which a gene operates that gene of

808
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:44,880
in which a gene operates that gene of
 

809
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,829
in which a gene operates that gene of
course the

810
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:45,839
course the
 

811
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,430
course the
first definition of environment that we

812
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:47,440
first definition of environment that we
 

813
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,030
first definition of environment that we
think of is pollution

814
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,040
think of is pollution
 

815
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,230
think of is pollution
or sunlight or heat or cold

816
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:52,240
or sunlight or heat or cold
 

817
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,829
or sunlight or heat or cold
and so forth that's the external

818
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:53,839
and so forth that's the external
 

819
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,230
and so forth that's the external
environment but every gene also operates

820
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,240
environment but every gene also operates
 

821
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,829
environment but every gene also operates
at the level of the internal cellular

822
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:57,839
at the level of the internal cellular
 

823
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,590
at the level of the internal cellular
environment that it's in

824
00:13:59,590 --> 00:13:59,600
environment that it's in
 

825
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,509
environment that it's in
if i take a gene from say an african

826
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:01,519
if i take a gene from say an african
 

827
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,670
if i take a gene from say an african
individual and i put it in a european

828
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:03,680
individual and i put it in a european
 

829
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,509
individual and i put it in a european
context

830
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:05,519
context
 

831
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,829
context
will it perform the same way probably

832
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:07,839
will it perform the same way probably
 

833
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,030
will it perform the same way probably
not because there's a cellular context

834
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,040
not because there's a cellular context
 

835
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,949
not because there's a cellular context
of thousands of other genes that that

836
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:12,959
of thousands of other genes that that
 

837
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,269
of thousands of other genes that that
gene has co-evolved with

838
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:15,279
gene has co-evolved with
 

839
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,990
gene has co-evolved with
you know in the out of africa event and

840
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,000
you know in the out of africa event and
 

841
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,470
you know in the out of africa event and
you know

842
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:18,480
you know
 

843
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,430
you know
all of this sort of human history of

844
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:21,440
all of this sort of human history of
 

845
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,230
all of this sort of human history of
evolution

846
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:22,240
evolution
 

847
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,629
evolution
so basically if you look at neandertal

848
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:24,639
so basically if you look at neandertal
 

849
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,389
so basically if you look at neandertal
genes for example

850
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:26,399
genes for example
 

851
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,790
genes for example
which again happened long after that uh

852
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:28,800
which again happened long after that uh
 

853
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,310
which again happened long after that uh
out of africa event

854
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:30,320
out of africa event
 

855
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,310
out of africa event
there's incompatibilities between

856
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:32,320
there's incompatibilities between
 

857
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,670
there's incompatibilities between
neanderthal genes

858
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:33,680
neanderthal genes
 

859
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,110
neanderthal genes
and modern human genes that can lead to

860
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,120
and modern human genes that can lead to
 

861
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,910
and modern human genes that can lead to
diseases

862
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:37,920
diseases
 

863
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,750
diseases
so in the context of the neonatal genome

864
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:39,760
so in the context of the neonatal genome
 

865
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,310
so in the context of the neonatal genome
that gene version that allele was fine

866
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,320
that gene version that allele was fine
 

867
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,910
that gene version that allele was fine
but in the context of the modern human

868
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:43,920
but in the context of the modern human
 

869
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,470
but in the context of the modern human
genome that neanderthal gene version is

870
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,480
genome that neanderthal gene version is
 

871
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,069
genome that neanderthal gene version is
actually detrimental

872
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:48,079
actually detrimental
 

873
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,990
actually detrimental
so it's it's you know that cellular

874
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,000
so it's it's you know that cellular
 

875
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,509
so it's it's you know that cellular
environment

876
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:51,519
environment
 

877
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,829
environment
constitutes the genetics of that gene

878
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:53,839
constitutes the genetics of that gene
 

879
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,189
constitutes the genetics of that gene
but also of course all of the

880
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:55,199
but also of course all of the
 

881
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,750
but also of course all of the
epigenomics of that gene it's

882
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:57,760
epigenomics of that gene it's
 

883
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,629
epigenomics of that gene it's
fascinating that the

884
00:14:58,629 --> 00:14:58,639
fascinating that the
 

885
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,189
fascinating that the
the gene has a history i mean we talked

886
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:01,199
the gene has a history i mean we talked
 

887
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,350
the gene has a history i mean we talked
about this a little bit last time but

888
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:03,360
about this a little bit last time but
 

889
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,670
about this a little bit last time but
just and and then some of your research

890
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:05,680
just and and then some of your research
 

891
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,430
just and and then some of your research
goes into that but

892
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:07,440
goes into that but
 

893
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,069
goes into that but
the genes as they are today have have a

894
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:10,079
the genes as they are today have have a
 

895
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,430
the genes as they are today have have a
story

896
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:11,440
story
 

897
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,949
story
from the beginning of time and then some

898
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:14,959
from the beginning of time and then some
 

899
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,910
from the beginning of time and then some
sometimes their story was like their

900
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:17,920
sometimes their story was like their
 

901
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,350
sometimes their story was like their
path was useful

902
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:19,360
path was useful
 

903
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,870
path was useful
for survival for the particular

904
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:20,880
for survival for the particular
 

905
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,189
for survival for the particular
organisms and sometimes not

906
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:23,199
organisms and sometimes not
 

907
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,829
organisms and sometimes not
that's fascinating let me ask as a

908
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:25,839
that's fascinating let me ask as a
 

909
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:26,710
that's fascinating let me ask as a
tangent

910
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:26,720
tangent
 

911
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,470
tangent
we kind of started talking offline about

912
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:28,480
we kind of started talking offline about
 

913
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,829
we kind of started talking offline about
neanderthals uh

914
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:29,839
neanderthals uh
 

915
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,749
neanderthals uh
do you have something interesting

916
00:15:31,749 --> 00:15:31,759
do you have something interesting
 

917
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,749
do you have something interesting
genetically biologically

918
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:33,759
genetically biologically
 

919
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,990
genetically biologically
in terms of difference between uh

920
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,000
in terms of difference between uh
 

921
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,870
in terms of difference between uh
neanderthal

922
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:36,880
neanderthal
 

923
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,829
neanderthal
and like the different branches of human

924
00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:38,839
and like the different branches of human
 

925
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,030
and like the different branches of human
evolution that

926
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,040
evolution that
 

927
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,990
evolution that
you find fascinating neanderthals are

928
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,000
you find fascinating neanderthals are
 

929
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,069
you find fascinating neanderthals are
only one of about five branches

930
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:46,079
only one of about five branches
 

931
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,710
only one of about five branches
that we are pretty confident about one

932
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:48,720
that we are pretty confident about one
 

933
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,910
that we are pretty confident about one
branches of

934
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:49,920
branches of
 

935
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,790
branches of
of out of africa events so basically

936
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:52,800
of out of africa events so basically
 

937
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,150
of out of africa events so basically
there's neanderthals

938
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,160
there's neanderthals
 

939
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,470
there's neanderthals
there's denisovans what is the evidence

940
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:56,480
there's denisovans what is the evidence
 

941
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,230
there's denisovans what is the evidence
for denisovans

942
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:58,240
for denisovans
 

943
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,550
for denisovans
one tiny little fragment of one pinky

right less than 10 years ago yeah

950
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:09,759
right less than 10 years ago yeah
 

951
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,910
right less than 10 years ago yeah
and those are like little folks right no

952
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:11,920
and those are like little folks right no
 

953
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,350
and those are like little folks right no
no no no no that's yet another one

00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:13,360
no no no no that's yet another one
 

955
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,710
no no no no that's yet another one
though homo florences

956
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:14,720
though homo florences
 

957
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,470
though homo florences
it had the little folks in sort of

958
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,480
it had the little folks in sort of
 

959
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,389
it had the little folks in sort of
indonesia but then

960
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:18,399
indonesia but then
 

961
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,470
indonesia but then
uh denisovans are basically another

962
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:20,480
uh denisovans are basically another
 

963
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,990
uh denisovans are basically another
branch that we only know

964
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,000
branch that we only know
 

965
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,550
branch that we only know
about genetically from that one bone and

966
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:24,560
about genetically from that one bone and
 

967
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,350
about genetically from that one bone and
eventually

968
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:25,360
eventually
 

969
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,870
eventually
we realize that it's one of the three

970
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:26,880
we realize that it's one of the three
 

971
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,629
we realize that it's one of the three
major branches along with neanderthal

972
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:28,639
major branches along with neanderthal
 

973
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,590
major branches along with neanderthal
modern human

974
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:29,600
modern human
 

975
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,470
modern human
and denisovan and then that one branch

976
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:32,480
and denisovan and then that one branch
 

977
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,150
and denisovan and then that one branch
has now resurfaced in many different

978
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,160
has now resurfaced in many different
 

979
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,389
has now resurfaced in many different
areas and we kind of know about the gene

980
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:36,399
areas and we kind of know about the gene
 

981
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,389
areas and we kind of know about the gene
flow that happened in between them

982
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:38,399
flow that happened in between them
 

983
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,949
flow that happened in between them
so when i was reading my greek mythology

984
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:40,959
so when i was reading my greek mythology
 

985
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,790
so when i was reading my greek mythology
it was talking about the age of the

986
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:42,800
it was talking about the age of the
 

987
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,430
it was talking about the age of the
heroes

988
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:43,440
heroes
 

989
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,629
heroes
these eras of human like

990
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:46,639
these eras of human like
 

991
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,710
these eras of human like
you know precursors that were wiped out

992
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:48,720
you know precursors that were wiped out
 

993
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,990
you know precursors that were wiped out
by zeus or by all kinds

994
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,000
by zeus or by all kinds
 

995
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,550
by zeus or by all kinds
of wars and so forth like the titans and

996
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:52,560
of wars and so forth like the titans and
 

997
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,350
of wars and so forth like the titans and
the you know

998
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,360
the you know
 

999
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,389
the you know
it's it's ridiculous to sort of

1000
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:56,399
it's it's ridiculous to sort of
 

1001
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,749
it's it's ridiculous to sort of
read these stories as a kid because

1002
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:57,759
read these stories as a kid because
 

1003
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,069
read these stories as a kid because
you're like oh yeah whatever and then

1004
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:00,079
you're like oh yeah whatever and then
 

1005
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,069
you're like oh yeah whatever and then
you're growing up and you're like whoa

1006
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:02,079
you're growing up and you're like whoa
 

1007
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,829
you're growing up and you're like whoa
layers and layers of human-like

1008
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:03,839
layers and layers of human-like
 

1009
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:04,870
layers and layers of human-like
ancestors

1010
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:04,880
ancestors
 

1011
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,390
ancestors
and who knows if those stories were

1012
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:06,400
and who knows if those stories were
 

1013
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,870
and who knows if those stories were
inspired by bones that they found that

1014
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:08,880
inspired by bones that they found that
 

1015
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,470
inspired by bones that they found that
kind of looked human-like

1016
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:10,480
kind of looked human-like
 

1017
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,710
kind of looked human-like
but were not quite human-like who knows

1018
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:12,720
but were not quite human-like who knows
 

1019
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,549
but were not quite human-like who knows
if stories of dragons were inspired by

1020
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:14,559
if stories of dragons were inspired by
 

1021
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,069
if stories of dragons were inspired by
bones of dinosaurs

1022
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,079
bones of dinosaurs
 

1023
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,390
bones of dinosaurs
basically this archaeological evidence

1024
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:18,400
basically this archaeological evidence
 

1025
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,590
basically this archaeological evidence
has been there

1026
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:19,600
has been there
 

1027
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,069
has been there
and has probably entered the folk

1028
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:22,079
and has probably entered the folk
 

1029
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,829
and has probably entered the folk
imagination

1030
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:23,839
imagination
 

1031
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,909
imagination
migrated into those stories but it's not

1032
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:25,919
migrated into those stories but it's not
 

1033
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,750
migrated into those stories but it's not
that far you know removed from what

1034
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:27,760
that far you know removed from what
 

1035
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,710
that far you know removed from what
actually happened

1036
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:28,720
actually happened
 

1037
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,590
actually happened
of massive wars of wiping out

1038
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:31,600
of massive wars of wiping out
 

1039
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,549
of massive wars of wiping out
neanderthals

1040
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:32,559
neanderthals
 

1041
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,470
neanderthals
as humans are modern humans are

1042
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:34,480
as humans are modern humans are
 

1043
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,909
as humans are modern humans are
populating um

1044
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:35,919
populating um
 

1045
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,990
populating um
you know europe do you think do you

1046
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,000
you know europe do you think do you
 

1047
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,750
you know europe do you think do you
think what killed the neanderthals

1048
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:39,760
think what killed the neanderthals
 

1049
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,150
think what killed the neanderthals
and all those other branches is human

1050
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:42,160
and all those other branches is human
 

1051
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,950
and all those other branches is human
conflict or is it genetic conflict so

1052
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:44,960
conflict or is it genetic conflict so
 

1053
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,070
conflict or is it genetic conflict so
is it uh us humans being

1054
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,080
is it uh us humans being
 

1055
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,990
is it uh us humans being
the opposite of altruistic towards each

1056
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,000
the opposite of altruistic towards each
 

1057
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,270
the opposite of altruistic towards each
other or

1058
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:51,280
other or
 

1059
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,470
other or
is it uh some other

1060
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:54,480
is it uh some other
 

1061
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,470
is it uh some other
uh competition at some other level like

1062
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:56,480
uh competition at some other level like
 

1063
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,830
uh competition at some other level like
as we're discussing

1064
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:57,840
as we're discussing
 

1065
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,150
as we're discussing
yeah so if you look at a lot of human

1066
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:00,160
yeah so if you look at a lot of human
 

1067
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,190
yeah so if you look at a lot of human
traits today

1068
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,200
traits today
 

1069
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,789
traits today
they're probably not that far removed

1070
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:02,799
they're probably not that far removed
 

1071
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,390
they're probably not that far removed
from the human traits that got us where

1072
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:04,400
from the human traits that got us where
 

1073
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,510
from the human traits that got us where
we are now

1074
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:05,520
we are now
 

1075
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,549
we are now
so you know this whole tribalism

1076
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:08,559
so you know this whole tribalism
 

1077
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,590
so you know this whole tribalism
you know your my sports team or

1078
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:11,600
you know your my sports team or
 

1079
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,909
you know your my sports team or
your my you know political party or

1080
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:13,919
your my you know political party or
 

1081
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:14,789
your my you know political party or
you're my

1082
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:14,799
you're my
 

1083
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,110
you're my
you know tiny little village and

1084
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,120
you know tiny little village and
 

1085
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,909
you know tiny little village and
therefore

1086
00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:17,919
therefore
 

1087
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,190
therefore
you know if you're from that other

1088
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,200
you know if you're from that other
 

1089
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,270
you know if you're from that other
village i hate you but as soon as we're

1090
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:21,280
village i hate you but as soon as we're
 

1091
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,230
village i hate you but as soon as we're
both

1092
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:22,240
both
 

1093
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,630
both
in the major city i can't believe we're

1094
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:24,640
in the major city i can't believe we're
 

1095
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,830
in the major city i can't believe we're
from the same region my friend come

1096
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:27,840
from the same region my friend come
 

1097
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,350
from the same region my friend come
and like two neighboring countries

1098
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:29,360
and like two neighboring countries
 

1099
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,470
and like two neighboring countries
fighting and as soon as they're off in

1100
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:30,480
fighting and as soon as they're off in
 

1101
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,669
fighting and as soon as they're off in
another country they're like oh i can't

1102
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:31,679
another country they're like oh i can't
 

1103
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,029
another country they're like oh i can't
believe that right so

1104
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:33,039
believe that right so
 

1105
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,789
believe that right so
it's it's kind of funny like this

1106
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:34,799
it's it's kind of funny like this
 

1107
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,350
it's it's kind of funny like this
tribalism is nonsensical in many ways

1108
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:37,360
tribalism is nonsensical in many ways
 

1109
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:37,909
tribalism is nonsensical in many ways
it's like

1110
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:37,919
it's like
 

1111
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,549
it's like
cognitive incongruent that basically we

1112
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:40,559
cognitive incongruent that basically we
 

1113
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,029
cognitive incongruent that basically we
like

1114
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:41,039
like
 

1115
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,230
like
kin and selection for for

1116
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:44,240
kin and selection for for
 

1117
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,430
kin and selection for for
sort of liking kin is hugely

1118
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:47,440
sort of liking kin is hugely
 

1119
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,110
sort of liking kin is hugely
advantageous genetically

1120
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,120
advantageous genetically
 

1121
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,110
advantageous genetically
probably across all kinds of organs all

1122
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,120
probably across all kinds of organs all
 

1123
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,390
probably across all kinds of organs all
across all kinds of life

1124
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:52,400
across all kinds of life
 

1125
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,710
across all kinds of life
yeah so so basically if you now

1126
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:54,720
yeah so so basically if you now
 

1127
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,750
yeah so so basically if you now
transport that

1128
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:55,760
transport that
 

1129
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,750
transport that
to the sort of humans arriving

1130
00:18:59,750 --> 00:18:59,760
to the sort of humans arriving
 

1131
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,510
to the sort of humans arriving
in europe and neanderthals are

1132
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:01,520
in europe and neanderthals are
 

1133
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,789
in europe and neanderthals are
everywhere

1134
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:02,799
everywhere
 

1135
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:03,669
everywhere
what are you going to do you're going to

1136
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:03,679
what are you going to do you're going to
 

1137
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,150
what are you going to do you're going to
kill them off you know there's this

1138
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:06,160
kill them off you know there's this
 

1139
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,590
kill them off you know there's this
battle for territory

1140
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:07,600
battle for territory
 

1141
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,510
battle for territory
and these battle for they're not like us

1142
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:09,520
and these battle for they're not like us
 

1143
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,029
and these battle for they're not like us
we have to get rid of them

1144
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:11,039
we have to get rid of them
 

1145
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,270
we have to get rid of them
so basically there's a you know very

1146
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:13,280
so basically there's a you know very
 

1147
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,029
so basically there's a you know very
interesting mix there but and yet

1148
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:15,039
interesting mix there but and yet
 

1149
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,909
interesting mix there but and yet
and yet when you look at the genetics

1150
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:17,919
and yet when you look at the genetics
 

1151
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,230
and yet when you look at the genetics
there's tons of gene flow between them

1152
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:20,240
there's tons of gene flow between them
 

1153
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,190
there's tons of gene flow between them
so basically you know love romance

1154
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:23,200
so basically you know love romance
 

1155
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,950
so basically you know love romance
between you know

1156
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:24,960
between you know
 

1157
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,390
between you know
tribes but love uh uh spans

1158
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:28,400
tribes but love uh uh spans
 

1159
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,230
tribes but love uh uh spans
uh the gap between the different tribes

1160
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:30,240
uh the gap between the different tribes
 

1161
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,310
uh the gap between the different tribes
it's wrong julia it's across species

1162
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:32,320
it's wrong julia it's across species
 

1163
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,029
it's wrong julia it's across species
boundaries

1164
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:33,039
boundaries
 

1165
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,390
boundaries
sneaks away from the village

1166
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:36,400

 

1167
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,029

even before the out of africa there's

1168
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:39,039
even before the out of africa there's
 

1169
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,110
even before the out of africa there's
you know within africa's election

1170
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,120
you know within africa's election
 

1171
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,830
you know within africa's election
which was probably massive battles of

1172
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:43,840
which was probably massive battles of
 

1173
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,830
which was probably massive battles of
larger and larger tribes

1174
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:45,840
larger and larger tribes
 

1175
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,909
larger and larger tribes
selecting for our social networking

1176
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:49,919
selecting for our social networking
 

1177
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,029
selecting for our social networking
and savviness and uh you know probably

1178
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:53,039
and savviness and uh you know probably
 

1179
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,549
and savviness and uh you know probably
all our conspiracy theory

1180
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:54,559
all our conspiracy theory
 

1181
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,190
all our conspiracy theory
genes or you know dating back from then

1182
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:57,200
genes or you know dating back from then
 

1183
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,150
genes or you know dating back from then
and you know it's

1184
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,160
and you know it's
 

1185
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,350
and you know it's
so there's a lot of this mischievousness

1186
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:01,360
so there's a lot of this mischievousness
 

1187
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,630
so there's a lot of this mischievousness
in the history of human evolution that

1188
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:04,640
in the history of human evolution that
 

1189
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,190
in the history of human evolution that
unfortunately still present in you know

1190
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,200
unfortunately still present in you know
 

1191
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,190
unfortunately still present in you know
many ugly forms today

1192
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,200
many ugly forms today
 

1193
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,590
many ugly forms today
but probably contributed to our success

1194
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:11,600
but probably contributed to our success
 

1195
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,549
but probably contributed to our success
as a species

1196
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:12,559
as a species
 

1197
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,029
as a species
in wiping out other species it just

1198
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:15,039
in wiping out other species it just
 

1199
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,710
in wiping out other species it just
sucks that uh

1200
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:16,720
sucks that uh
 

1201
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,110
sucks that uh
we don't have neighboring species that

1202
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,120
we don't have neighboring species that
 

1203
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,990
we don't have neighboring species that
are

1204
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,000
are
 

1205
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,190
are
you know intelligent like us

1206
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:23,200
you know intelligent like us
 

1207
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,310
you know intelligent like us
that but yet very different than us

1208
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:26,320
that but yet very different than us
 

1209
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,950
that but yet very different than us
so we have like you know dogs or wolves

1210
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:28,960
so we have like you know dogs or wolves
 

1211
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,510
so we have like you know dogs or wolves
i guess

1212
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:29,520
i guess
 

1213
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,950
i guess
uh co-evolved they they figured out

1214
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:32,960
uh co-evolved they they figured out
 

1215
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,149
uh co-evolved they they figured out
how to uh neighbor up with humans in a

1216
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:36,159
how to uh neighbor up with humans in a
 

1217
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,470
how to uh neighbor up with humans in a
friendly way and collaborate and

1218
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:38,480
friendly way and collaborate and
 

1219
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,190
friendly way and collaborate and
it develop into describing this as if

1220
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:41,200
it develop into describing this as if
 

1221
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,070
it develop into describing this as if
the wolves made a choice

1222
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,080
the wolves made a choice
 

1223
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,590
the wolves made a choice
it's possible that the wolves never had

1224
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:45,600
it's possible that the wolves never had
 

1225
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,669
it's possible that the wolves never had
to say that basically humans were just

1226
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:47,679
to say that basically humans were just
 

1227
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,470
to say that basically humans were just
so

1228
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:48,480
so
 

1229
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,630
so
overpowering that they had captive

1230
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:50,640
overpowering that they had captive
 

1231
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,510
overpowering that they had captive
wolves

1232
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:51,520
wolves
 

1233
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,669
wolves
and then at every generation killed off

1234
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:53,679
and then at every generation killed off
 

1235
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,029
and then at every generation killed off
eight of the nine pups

1236
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:55,039
eight of the nine pups
 

1237
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,870
eight of the nine pups
and only kept the one that was milder ah

1238
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:56,880
and only kept the one that was milder ah
 

1239
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,950
and only kept the one that was milder ah
humans it only takes a few generations

1240
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:58,960
humans it only takes a few generations
 

1241
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,470
humans it only takes a few generations
to then sort of have pups that are

1242
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:00,480
to then sort of have pups that are
 

1243
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,230
to then sort of have pups that are
really mild

1244
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:02,240
really mild
 

1245
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,390
really mild
and so the neanderthals weren't useful

1246
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:06,400
and so the neanderthals weren't useful
 

1247
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,630
and so the neanderthals weren't useful
in the same way i don't know if it's a

1248
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:08,640
in the same way i don't know if it's a
 

1249
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,990
in the same way i don't know if it's a
question of useful they were probably

1250
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:10,000
question of useful they were probably
 

1251
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,430
question of useful they were probably
super useful

1252
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:11,440
super useful
 

1253
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,630
super useful
my thinking is that they were

1254
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:14,640
my thinking is that they were
 

1255
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,630
my thinking is that they were
scary that basically something that

1256
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:16,640
scary that basically something that
 

1257
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,990
scary that basically something that
almost resembles you

1258
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,000
almost resembles you
 

1259
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,149
almost resembles you
yeah is something that you try to

1260
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:20,159
yeah is something that you try to
 

1261
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,029
yeah is something that you try to
eliminate first

1262
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:21,039
eliminate first
 

1263
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,149
eliminate first
it's too close yeah and uh speaking of

1264
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:24,159
it's too close yeah and uh speaking of
 

1265
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,870
it's too close yeah and uh speaking of
um you know species that are intelligent

1266
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:26,880
um you know species that are intelligent
 

1267
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,669
um you know species that are intelligent
and sort of

1268
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:27,679
and sort of
 

1269
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,190
and sort of
what's left of evolution it is a shame

1270
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,200
what's left of evolution it is a shame
 

1271
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,390
what's left of evolution it is a shame
exactly like you say that

1272
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:32,400
exactly like you say that
 

1273
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,630
exactly like you say that
so many different amazing life forms

1274
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:34,640
so many different amazing life forms
 

1275
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,310
so many different amazing life forms
were extinct

1276
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:36,320
were extinct
 

1277
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,230
were extinct
and the kind of boring ones remained

1278
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:40,240
and the kind of boring ones remained
 

1279
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,029
and the kind of boring ones remained
so if you look at dinosaurs i mean the

1280
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:43,039
so if you look at dinosaurs i mean the
 

1281
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,070
so if you look at dinosaurs i mean the
diversity

1282
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,080
diversity
 

1283
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,990
diversity
that they had if you look at sub you

1284
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,000
that they had if you look at sub you
 

1285
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,350
that they had if you look at sub you
know like

1286
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:47,360
know like
 

1287
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,070
know like
there's just so many different lineages

1288
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:50,080
there's just so many different lineages
 

1289
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,630
there's just so many different lineages
of

1290
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:50,640
of
 

1291
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,149
of
life that were just abruptly killed

1292
00:21:54,149 --> 00:21:54,159
life that were just abruptly killed
 

1293
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,190
life that were just abruptly killed
and yet out of that death emerged

1294
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:57,200
and yet out of that death emerged
 

1295
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,950
and yet out of that death emerged
you know many new kinds of really

1296
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:58,960
you know many new kinds of really
 

1297
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,950
you know many new kinds of really
awesome lineages do you think there was

1298
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:00,960
awesome lineages do you think there was
 

1299
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,470
awesome lineages do you think there was
in the history of

1300
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:02,480
in the history of
 

1301
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,510
in the history of
life on earth species that may be still

1302
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:05,520
life on earth species that may be still
 

1303
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,470
life on earth species that may be still
alive today

1304
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:06,480
alive today
 

1305
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,470
alive today
that are more intelligent than humans

1306
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:08,480
that are more intelligent than humans
 

1307
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,510
that are more intelligent than humans
and we just don't know

1308
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:09,520
and we just don't know
 

1309
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,669
and we just don't know
it's also made for dolphins like if you

1310
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:11,679
it's also made for dolphins like if you
 

1311
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,430
it's also made for dolphins like if you
look at their brains if you look at the

1312
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:13,440
look at their brains if you look at the
 

1313
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,110
look at their brains if you look at the
way that they play if you look at the

1314
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,120
way that they play if you look at the
 

1315
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,470
way that they play if you look at the
way that they learn

1316
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:16,480
way that they learn
 

1317
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,390
way that they learn
uh you know i mean they don't have

1318
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:18,400
uh you know i mean they don't have
 

1319
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,909
uh you know i mean they don't have
possible thumbs and we do

1320
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:19,919
possible thumbs and we do
 

1321
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,510
possible thumbs and we do
so you know that probably made a big

1322
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:21,520
so you know that probably made a big
 

1323
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,270
so you know that probably made a big
difference it's terrifying to think that

1324
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:23,280
difference it's terrifying to think that
 

1325
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:23,669
difference it's terrifying to think that
like

1326
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:23,679
like
 

1327
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,190
like
not terrifying i don't know how to feel

1328
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:25,200
not terrifying i don't know how to feel
 

1329
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,190
not terrifying i don't know how to feel
about it that they're more intelligent

1330
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:27,200
about it that they're more intelligent
 

1331
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,750
about it that they're more intelligent
than us

1332
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:27,760
than us
 

1333
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,789
than us
it's like a hitchhiker's guide i know

1334
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:30,799
it's like a hitchhiker's guide i know
 

1335
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,549
it's like a hitchhiker's guide i know
but how do you define intelligence

1336
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:32,559
but how do you define intelligence
 

1337
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,789
but how do you define intelligence
basically like i was saying last time

1338
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:34,799
basically like i was saying last time
 

1339
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,630
basically like i was saying last time
you know stupid is a stupid does and

1340
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:36,640
you know stupid is a stupid does and
 

1341
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,390
you know stupid is a stupid does and
smart is a smart does so

1342
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:38,400
smart is a smart does so
 

1343
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,190
smart is a smart does so
yeah if the dolphins are basically super

1344
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:41,200
yeah if the dolphins are basically super
 

1345
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:41,830
yeah if the dolphins are basically super
smart

1346
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:41,840
smart
 

1347
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,350
smart
figure out the meaning of life and just

1348
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:43,360
figure out the meaning of life and just
 

1349
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,270
figure out the meaning of life and just
go around playing with water all day

1350
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:45,280
go around playing with water all day
 

1351
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,029
go around playing with water all day
which is probably the meaning of life

1352
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:49,039

 

1353
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,630

then we wouldn't know because all

1354
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:50,640
then we wouldn't know because all
 

1355
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,149
then we wouldn't know because all
they're doing is kicking water just like

1356
00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:52,159
they're doing is kicking water just like
 

1357
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,350
they're doing is kicking water just like
sharks are and sharks are probably

1358
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:53,360
sharks are and sharks are probably
 

1359
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,470
sharks are and sharks are probably
pretty stupid

1360
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:54,480
pretty stupid
 

1361
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,270
pretty stupid
so so basically it's very difficult to

1362
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:57,280
so so basically it's very difficult to
 

1363
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,750
so so basically it's very difficult to
sort of

1364
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:57,760
sort of
 

1365
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,830
sort of
judge a species intelligence unless you

1366
00:22:59,830 --> 00:22:59,840
judge a species intelligence unless you
 

1367
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,950
judge a species intelligence unless you
they kind of go out of their way to

1368
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:00,960
they kind of go out of their way to
 

1369
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,789
they kind of go out of their way to
demonstrate it

1370
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:02,799
demonstrate it
 

1371
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,669
demonstrate it
yeah and that's instructive for our

1372
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:05,679
yeah and that's instructive for our
 

1373
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,149
yeah and that's instructive for our
understanding of any kind of life form

1374
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:08,159
understanding of any kind of life form
 

1375
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,630
understanding of any kind of life form
uh you know i recently talked to sarah

1376
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:10,640
uh you know i recently talked to sarah
 

1377
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,669
uh you know i recently talked to sarah
seeger looking for

1378
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:11,679
seeger looking for
 

1379
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,029
seeger looking for
life out there on other planets it'd be

1380
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:15,039
life out there on other planets it'd be
 

1381
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,390
life out there on other planets it'd be
fascinating to think

1382
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:16,400
fascinating to think
 

1383
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,750
fascinating to think
if we discover a habitable planet that's

1384
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:19,760
if we discover a habitable planet that's
 

1385
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,830
if we discover a habitable planet that's
you know outside of earth in one day

1386
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:21,840
you know outside of earth in one day
 

1387
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,830
you know outside of earth in one day
maybe many centuries away or be able to

1388
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:23,840
maybe many centuries away or be able to
 

1389
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,310
maybe many centuries away or be able to
travel

1390
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:24,320
travel
 

1391
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,630
travel
with like a robot there how would we

1392
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:26,640
with like a robot there how would we
 

1393
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,390
with like a robot there how would we
actually know

1394
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:28,400
actually know
 

1395
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,510
actually know
that this species would probably be able

1396
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:31,520
that this species would probably be able
 

1397
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,190
that this species would probably be able
to detect that it's a living

1398
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:33,200
to detect that it's a living
 

1399
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,310
to detect that it's a living
being but how would we know if it's an

1400
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:36,320
being but how would we know if it's an
 

1401
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,149
being but how would we know if it's an
intelligent being

1402
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:38,159
intelligent being
 

1403
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,029
intelligent being
i mean uh it's both exciting and

1404
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:41,039
i mean uh it's both exciting and
 

1405
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:41,909
i mean uh it's both exciting and
terrifying

1406
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:41,919
terrifying
 

1407
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,269
terrifying
to sort of come face to face with a

1408
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:45,279
to sort of come face to face with a
 

1409
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,310
to sort of come face to face with a
life form that's of another world

1410
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:48,320
life form that's of another world
 

1411
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,110
life form that's of another world
like something that clearly is moving in

1412
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,120
like something that clearly is moving in
 

1413
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,230
like something that clearly is moving in
a um

1414
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:52,240
a um
 

1415
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,310
a um
how would you say like a deliberate way

1416
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:56,320
how would you say like a deliberate way
 

1417
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,950
how would you say like a deliberate way
and to then like ask well how do i ask

1418
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:58,960
and to then like ask well how do i ask
 

1419
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,669
and to then like ask well how do i ask
that thing

1420
00:23:59,669 --> 00:23:59,679
that thing
 

1421
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,310
that thing
with it whether it's intelligent no but

1422
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:02,320
with it whether it's intelligent no but
 

1423
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,630
with it whether it's intelligent no but
the the question that you're asking is

1424
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:04,640
the the question that you're asking is
 

1425
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,190
the the question that you're asking is
um applicable to every species on on the

1426
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,200
um applicable to every species on on the
 

1427
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,390
um applicable to every species on on the
earth on earth now

1428
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:08,400
earth on earth now
 

1429
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,470
earth on earth now
yeah so basically you know dolphins are

1430
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:10,480
yeah so basically you know dolphins are
 

1431
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,789
yeah so basically you know dolphins are
a great example we know that they're

1432
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:12,799
a great example we know that they're
 

1433
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,510
a great example we know that they're
you know clearly capable hardware wise

1434
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:15,520
you know clearly capable hardware wise
 

1435
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,710
you know clearly capable hardware wise
and behavior-wise

1436
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:16,720
and behavior-wise
 

1437
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,269
and behavior-wise
of intelligence you know how do we

1438
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:19,279
of intelligence you know how do we
 

1439
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:19,990
of intelligence you know how do we
communicate

1440
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,000
communicate
 

1441
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,750
communicate
so basically if your question is about

1442
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:21,760
so basically if your question is about
 

1443
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,029
so basically if your question is about
crossing species boundaries of

1444
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:23,039
crossing species boundaries of
 

1445
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,630
crossing species boundaries of
communication

1446
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:26,640

 

1447
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,110

the way that i want to put it is that

1448
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:29,120
the way that i want to put it is that
 

1449
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,630
the way that i want to put it is that
humans have achieved

1450
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:30,640
humans have achieved
 

1451
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,190
humans have achieved
a level of sophistication in our

1452
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:33,200
a level of sophistication in our
 

1453
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,029
a level of sophistication in our
behaviors in our communication in our

1454
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:35,039
behaviors in our communication in our
 

1455
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:35,830
behaviors in our communication in our
language

1456
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:35,840
language
 

1457
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,029
language
in our ways of expressing ourselves

1458
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:39,039
in our ways of expressing ourselves
 

1459
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,710
in our ways of expressing ourselves
that i have no doubt that if we

1460
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:42,720
that i have no doubt that if we
 

1461
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,230
that i have no doubt that if we
encounter the human-like form of

1462
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:44,240
encounter the human-like form of
 

1463
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,310
encounter the human-like form of
intelligence we'd figure out their

1464
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:46,320
intelligence we'd figure out their
 

1465
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:46,870
intelligence we'd figure out their
language

1466
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:46,880
language
 

1467
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,830
language
in a few weeks like it'd be just fine as

1468
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:49,840
in a few weeks like it'd be just fine as
 

1469
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,350
in a few weeks like it'd be just fine as
long as you know of course

1470
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:51,360
long as you know of course
 

1471
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,029
long as you know of course
they're both trusting each other not

1472
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:53,039
they're both trusting each other not
 

1473
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,950
they're both trusting each other not
annihilating each other and not sort of

1474
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:54,960
annihilating each other and not sort of
 

1475
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,870
annihilating each other and not sort of
fearing each other and attacking each

1476
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:56,880
fearing each other and attacking each
 

1477
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,070
fearing each other and attacking each
other what about

1478
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,080
other what about
 

1479
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,789
other what about
the message just out of curiosity into

1480
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:00,799
the message just out of curiosity into
 

1481
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,630
the message just out of curiosity into
science fiction land a little bit

1482
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:02,640
science fiction land a little bit
 

1483
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,430
science fiction land a little bit
if so uh clearly you're one of the top

1484
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:05,440
if so uh clearly you're one of the top
 

1485
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,549
if so uh clearly you're one of the top
scientists in the world

1486
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:06,559
scientists in the world
 

1487
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,390
scientists in the world
so if we were to discover an alien life

1488
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:10,400
so if we were to discover an alien life
 

1489
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,669
so if we were to discover an alien life
form

1490
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:11,679

1491
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,149
form
uh you would be brought in to study his

1492
00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:14,159
uh you would be brought in to study his
 

1493
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,669
uh you would be brought in to study his
genetics

1494
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:15,679
genetics
 

1495
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,669
genetics
do you think the epigenome that we

1496
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:17,679
do you think the epigenome that we
 

1497
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,430
do you think the epigenome that we
talked about the genome

1498
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:19,440
talked about the genome
 

1499
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,230
talked about the genome
the code the digital code that underlies

1500
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:22,240
the code the digital code that underlies
 

1501
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,149
the code the digital code that underlies
that alien life form would be similar to

1502
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:24,159
that alien life form would be similar to
 

1503
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,029
that alien life form would be similar to
ours

1504
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:25,039
ours
 

1505
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,190
ours
like the in um in fundamental ways maybe

1506
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:29,200
like the in um in fundamental ways maybe
 

1507
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,149
like the in um in fundamental ways maybe
not exactly but

1508
00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:30,159
not exactly but
 

1509
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,909
not exactly but
in fundamental ways of how it's

1510
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:31,919
in fundamental ways of how it's
 

1511
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,590
in fundamental ways of how it's
structured yeah so so

1512
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:33,600
structured yeah so so
 

1513
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,190
structured yeah so so
you're getting to the very definition of

1514
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:35,200
you're getting to the very definition of
 

1515
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,230
you're getting to the very definition of
life you're getting to the very

1516
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:36,240
life you're getting to the very
 

1517
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:36,950
life you're getting to the very
definition

1518
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:36,960
definition
 

1519
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,830
definition
of what what makes life life and how do

1520
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:39,840
of what what makes life life and how do
 

1521
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,310
of what what makes life life and how do
we

1522
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:40,320
we
 

1523
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,310
we
decode that life and it's so easy to

1524
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,320
decode that life and it's so easy to
 

1525
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,830
decode that life and it's so easy to
think that every life form would

1526
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:45,840
think that every life form would
 

1527
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,870
think that every life form would
basically have to

1528
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:46,880
basically have to
 

1529
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,070
basically have to
you know like oxygen has to have to like

1530
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,080
you know like oxygen has to have to like
 

1531
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,789
you know like oxygen has to have to like
heat from the sun and rely on sort of

1532
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:52,799
heat from the sun and rely on sort of
 

1533
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,710
heat from the sun and rely on sort of
being in the habitable zone

1534
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:54,720
being in the habitable zone
 

1535
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,510
being in the habitable zone
of you know its solar system and so

1536
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:57,520
of you know its solar system and so
 

1537
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,070
of you know its solar system and so
forth

1538
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:58,080
forth
 

1539
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,430
forth
but i think we have to sort of go beyond

1540
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:01,440
but i think we have to sort of go beyond
 

1541
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:01,909
but i think we have to sort of go beyond
this

1542
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:01,919
this
 

1543
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,630
this
sort of oh life on another planet must

1544
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:04,640
sort of oh life on another planet must
 

1545
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,710
sort of oh life on another planet must
be exactly like life is on earth

1546
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:06,720
be exactly like life is on earth
 

1547
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,029
be exactly like life is on earth
because of course life on earth happens

1548
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:09,039
because of course life on earth happens
 

1549
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,269
because of course life on earth happens
to rely on the proximity to the sun

1550
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:11,279
to rely on the proximity to the sun
 

1551
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,909
to rely on the proximity to the sun
and benefit from that amount of energy

1552
00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:13,919
and benefit from that amount of energy
 

1553
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,830
and benefit from that amount of energy
but we're talking at

1554
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:15,840
but we're talking at
 

1555
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,510
but we're talking at
time scales of human life

1556
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:19,520
time scales of human life
 

1557
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,510
time scales of human life
where we kind of live i don't know

1558
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:21,520
where we kind of live i don't know
 

1559
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,590
where we kind of live i don't know
between and i'm going to be super wide

1560
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:23,600
between and i'm going to be super wide
 

1561
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,070
between and i'm going to be super wide
here

1562
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:24,080
here
 

1563
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,190
here
we're going we're going to live between

1564
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:25,200
we're going we're going to live between
 

1565
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,430
we're going we're going to live between
six earth months and

1566
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:27,440
six earth months and
 

1567
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,230
six earth months and
you know 200 a month earth months or 200

00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:30,240
you know 200 a month earth months or 200

earth years
 

1571
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,590
earth years
so basically if you look at the time

1572
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:33,600
so basically if you look at the time
 

1573
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,310
so basically if you look at the time
scale

1574

above the surface look at has to do with
 

1613
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,590
above the surface look at has to do with

near these volcanic uh
 

1631
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,470
near these volcanic uh
you know ducts that basically emanate

1632
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:48,480
you know ducts that basically emanate
 

1633
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,590
you know ducts that basically emanate
a massive amount of energy from the core

what does life need it needs energy does

1638
00:27:55,269 --> 00:27:55,279
what does life need it needs energy does
 

1639
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,070
what does life need it needs energy does
it need

1640
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,080
it need
 

1641
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,909
it need
energy from the sun it couldn't care

1642
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:57,919
energy from the sun it couldn't care
 

1643
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,310
energy from the sun it couldn't care
less does it need energy from

1644
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:00,320
less does it need energy from
 

1645
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,110
less does it need energy from
you know the earth itself yeah possibly

1646
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:03,120
you know the earth itself yeah possibly
 

1647
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,070
you know the earth itself yeah possibly
it could use

1648
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,080
it could use
 

1649
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,310
it could use
that and if you look at how did life

1650
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:06,320
that and if you look at how did life
 

1651
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,110
that and if you look at how did life
evolve

1652
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,120
evolve
 

1653
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,830
evolve
on you know on earth there are many

1654
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:09,840
on you know on earth there are many
 

1655
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,630
on you know on earth there are many
theories

1656
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:10,640
theories
 

1657
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,870
theories
i mean a kind of silly theory is that it

1658
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:12,880
i mean a kind of silly theory is that it
 

1659
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,070
i mean a kind of silly theory is that it
came from outer space

1660
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,080
came from outer space
 

1661
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,590
came from outer space
that basically there's a meteorite out

1662
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:15,600
that basically there's a meteorite out
 

1663
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,029
that basically there's a meteorite out
there that sort of landed on earth and

1664
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:17,039
there that sort of landed on earth and
 

1665
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,149
there that sort of landed on earth and
it brought with it

1666
00:28:18,149 --> 00:28:18,159
it brought with it
 

1667
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,230
it brought with it
dna material i think it's a little silly

1668
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:20,240
dna material i think it's a little silly
 

1669
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,510
dna material i think it's a little silly
because it kind of pushes the buck down

1670
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:21,520
because it kind of pushes the buck down
 

1671
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,230
because it kind of pushes the buck down
the road

1672
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:22,240
the road
 

1673
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,909
the road
basically the next question is how did

1674
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:23,919
basically the next question is how did
 

1675
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,669
basically the next question is how did
it evolve over there yeah

1676
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:25,679
it evolve over there yeah
 

1677
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,510
it evolve over there yeah
whereas our planet has basically all of

1678
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:27,520
whereas our planet has basically all of
 

1679
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,789
whereas our planet has basically all of
the right ingredients why wouldn't

1680
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:28,799
the right ingredients why wouldn't
 

1681
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:29,990
the right ingredients why wouldn't
evolve here so basically

1682
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,000
evolve here so basically
 

1683
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,350
evolve here so basically
let's kind of ignore that one and now

1684
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:31,360
let's kind of ignore that one and now
 

1685
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,870
let's kind of ignore that one and now
that the two other competing hypotheses

1686
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:32,880
that the two other competing hypotheses
 

1687
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,510
that the two other competing hypotheses
are from the

1688
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:33,520
are from the
 

1689
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,789
are from the
outside in or from the inside out

1690
00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:36,799
outside in or from the inside out
 

1691
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,070
outside in or from the inside out
from the outside in means from the

1692
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,080
from the outside in means from the
 

1693
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,230
from the outside in means from the
surface to the bottom of the ocean

1694
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:40,240
surface to the bottom of the ocean
 

1695
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,389
surface to the bottom of the ocean
ah from the inside out means from the

1696
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:42,399
ah from the inside out means from the
 

1697
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,149
ah from the inside out means from the
bottom of the ocean to the surface

1698
00:28:46,149 --> 00:28:46,159

 

1699
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:51,269

so life on the surface is pretty brutal

1700
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:51,279
so life on the surface is pretty brutal
 

1701
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,950
so life on the surface is pretty brutal
life obviously evolved in the water

1702
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:54,960
life obviously evolved in the water
 

1703
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,070
life obviously evolved in the water
and then there was an out of water event

1704
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,080
and then there was an out of water event
 

1705
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,350
and then there was an out of water event
but basically before it exited

1706
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:01,360
but basically before it exited
 

1707
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,029
but basically before it exited
it was clearly in the water which is a

1708
00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:03,039
it was clearly in the water which is a
 

1709
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,029
it was clearly in the water which is a
much nicer and shielded environment

1710
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:05,039
much nicer and shielded environment
 

1711
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,230
much nicer and shielded environment
so just to be clear on the surface

1712
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:08,240
so just to be clear on the surface
 

1713
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,470
so just to be clear on the surface
are you referring to the the surface of

1714
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:10,480
are you referring to the the surface of
 

1715
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,870
are you referring to the the surface of
the sea or the bottom of the sea

1716
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:12,880
the sea or the bottom of the sea
 

1717
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,830
the sea or the bottom of the sea
versus the bottom of the sea and you're

1718
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:15,840
versus the bottom of the sea and you're
 

1719
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,230
versus the bottom of the sea and you're
saying

1720
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:16,240
saying
 

1721
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,750
saying
life on the surface is uh it's harsh

1722
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:19,760
life on the surface is uh it's harsh
 

1723
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,789
life on the surface is uh it's harsh
like inside the life outside the water

1724
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:22,799
like inside the life outside the water
 

1725
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,149
like inside the life outside the water
is horrible

1726
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:24,159
is horrible
 

1727
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,029
is horrible
it takes huge amounts of evolutionary

1728
00:29:27,029 --> 00:29:27,039
it takes huge amounts of evolutionary
 

1729
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,470
it takes huge amounts of evolutionary
innovations to sustain

1730
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:28,480
innovations to sustain
 

1731
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,830
innovations to sustain
living outside the water well that's so

1732
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:31,840
living outside the water well that's so
 

1733
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,549
living outside the water well that's so
interesting why

1734
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:32,559
interesting why
 

1735
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:35,190
interesting why
why is that so it's easier to life is

1736
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:35,200
why is that so it's easier to life is
 

1737
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,990
why is that so it's easier to life is
easier

1738
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:36,000
easier
 

1739
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,510
easier
in the water maybe see i'm telling you

1740
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:37,520
in the water maybe see i'm telling you
 

1741
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,269
in the water maybe see i'm telling you
don't

1742
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:39,279
don't
 

1743
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,190
don't
water yeah dolphins went back into the

1744
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:41,200
water yeah dolphins went back into the
 

1745
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,630
water yeah dolphins went back into the
water really

1746
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:42,640
water really
 

1747
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,710
water really
because dolphins are mammals of course

1748
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:44,720
because dolphins are mammals of course
 

1749
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,830
because dolphins are mammals of course
yeah interesting

1750
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:45,840
yeah interesting
 

1751
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,430
yeah interesting
well again they might be smarter they

1752
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:47,440
well again they might be smarter they
 

1753
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,590
well again they might be smarter they
went back

1754
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:49,600
went back
 

1755
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,710
went back
so so if you if you basically think

1756
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:52,720
so so if you if you basically think
 

1757
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,510
so so if you if you basically think
about

1758
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:53,520
about
 

1759
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,470
about
the fact that we are 70 water we're

1760
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:56,480
the fact that we are 70 water we're
 

1761
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,110
the fact that we are 70 water we're
basically transporting the sea with us

1762
00:29:59,110 --> 00:29:59,120
basically transporting the sea with us
 

1763
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,630
basically transporting the sea with us
outside the sea you know if we if we

1764
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:02,640
outside the sea you know if we if we
 

1765
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,190
outside the sea you know if we if we
don't have

1766
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:03,200
don't have
 

1767
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,909
don't have
water for about a year 24 hours we're

1768
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:05,919
water for about a year 24 hours we're
 

1769
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:06,549
water for about a year 24 hours we're
dry

1770
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:06,559
dry
 

1771
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,350
dry
yeah and if you look at life under the

1772
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:09,360
yeah and if you look at life under the
 

1773
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,389
yeah and if you look at life under the
sea i mean i don't know if you're a

1774
00:30:10,389 --> 00:30:10,399
sea i mean i don't know if you're a
 

1775
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:10,950
sea i mean i don't know if you're a
diver

1776
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:10,960
diver
 

1777
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,350
diver
but when you go diving your brain

1778
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:13,360
but when you go diving your brain
 

1779
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,710
but when you go diving your brain
explodes

1780
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:14,720
explodes
 

1781
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,549
explodes
again when i say the light the boring

1782
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:16,559
again when i say the light the boring
 

1783
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,470
again when i say the light the boring
life forms is what we see all the time

1784
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:18,480
life forms is what we see all the time
 

1785
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,029
life forms is what we see all the time
like tetrapods i mean what a stupid

1786
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:21,039
like tetrapods i mean what a stupid
 

1787
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:21,590
like tetrapods i mean what a stupid
boring

1788
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:21,600
boring
 

1789
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,590
boring
body plan seriously like just go diving

1790
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:25,600
body plan seriously like just go diving
 

1791
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,110
body plan seriously like just go diving
and you'll see that a tiny little

1792
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:27,120
and you'll see that a tiny little
 

1793
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,070
and you'll see that a tiny little
minority

1794
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:28,080
minority
 

1795
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,669
minority
of the stuff under the sea under the

1796
00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:29,679
of the stuff under the sea under the
 

1797
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,710
of the stuff under the sea under the
surface of the sea is actually tetrapods

1798
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:32,720
surface of the sea is actually tetrapods
 

1799
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,029
surface of the sea is actually tetrapods
it's like you know snails with all kinds

1800
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:35,039
it's like you know snails with all kinds
 

1801
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,430
it's like you know snails with all kinds
of crazy appendages and colors and

1802
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:37,440
of crazy appendages and colors and
 

1803
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,350
of crazy appendages and colors and
you know round things and five-way

1804
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:39,360
you know round things and five-way
 

1805
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,350
you know round things and five-way
symmetric things and you know

1806
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:41,360
symmetric things and you know
 

1807
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,110
symmetric things and you know
eight-way symmetric things all kinds of

1808
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,120
eight-way symmetric things all kinds of
 

1809
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,870
eight-way symmetric things all kinds of
crazy body plans

1810
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:44,880
crazy body plans
 

1811
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,750
crazy body plans
and only the tetrapod fish managed to

1812
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:47,760
and only the tetrapod fish managed to
 

1813
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,710
and only the tetrapod fish managed to
get out

1814
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:48,720
get out
 

1815
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,990
get out
and then they gave rise to all the

1816
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:50,000
and then they gave rise to all the
 

1817
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,149
and then they gave rise to all the
boring plants we kind of see today

1818
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:52,159
boring plants we kind of see today
 

1819
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,510
boring plants we kind of see today
of basically you know uh humans with

1820
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:55,520
of basically you know uh humans with
 

1821
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,230
of basically you know uh humans with
four limbs

1822
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:56,240
four limbs
 

1823
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,070
four limbs
birds with four limbs lizards with four

1824
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:58,080
birds with four limbs lizards with four
 

1825
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,470
birds with four limbs lizards with four
limbs and you know

1826
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:00,480
limbs and you know
 

1827
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,710
limbs and you know
right it's kind of boring if you look at

1828
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:02,720
right it's kind of boring if you look at
 

1829
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,830
right it's kind of boring if you look at
by comparison

1830
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:03,840
by comparison
 

1831
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,509
by comparison
life underwater is teeming with

1832
00:31:05,509 --> 00:31:05,519
life underwater is teeming with
 

1833
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,190
life underwater is teeming with
diversity

1834
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:07,200
diversity
 

1835
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,350
diversity
so now let's roll back the clock and

1836
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:09,360
so now let's roll back the clock and
 

1837
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,389
so now let's roll back the clock and
basically say

1838
00:31:10,389 --> 00:31:10,399
basically say
 

1839
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,710
basically say
where did life in the ocean come from

1840
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:12,720
where did life in the ocean come from
 

1841
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,909
where did life in the ocean come from
from the surface

1842
00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:13,919
from the surface
 

1843
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,269
from the surface
or from the bottom exactly those two

1844
00:31:15,269 --> 00:31:15,279
or from the bottom exactly those two
 

1845
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,470
or from the bottom exactly those two
options exactly so basically life on the

1846
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:18,480
options exactly so basically life on the
 

1847
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,269
options exactly so basically life on the
surface

1848
00:31:19,269 --> 00:31:19,279
surface
 

1849
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,909
surface
is one option and then the idea there is

1850
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:21,919
is one option and then the idea there is
 

1851
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:22,470
is one option and then the idea there is
that

1852
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:22,480
that
 

1853
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,870
that
there's tides with the moon and the sun

1854
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:24,880
there's tides with the moon and the sun
 

1855
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,950
there's tides with the moon and the sun
sort of causing all this movement

1856
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:26,960
sort of causing all this movement
 

1857
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,710
sort of causing all this movement
and this movement is basically causing

1858
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:28,720
and this movement is basically causing
 

1859
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,149
and this movement is basically causing
nutrients to sort of

1860
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:30,159
nutrients to sort of
 

1861
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,230
nutrients to sort of
you know coalesce and you know bounce

1862
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:32,240
you know coalesce and you know bounce
 

1863
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,830
you know coalesce and you know bounce
around et cetera that's one option

1864
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:33,840
around et cetera that's one option
 

1865
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,149
around et cetera that's one option
the second option massive amount of

1866
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:36,159
the second option massive amount of
 

1867
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,830
the second option massive amount of
energy under

1868
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:37,840
energy under
 

1869
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,149
energy under
you know from from from our the core of

1870
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:40,159
you know from from from our the core of
 

1871
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,190
you know from from from our the core of
our planet

1872
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:41,200
our planet
 

1873
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,310
our planet
basically uh exploited

1874
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:44,320
basically uh exploited
 

1875
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,950
basically uh exploited
leading to these basic ingredients of

1876
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:46,960
leading to these basic ingredients of
 

1877
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,909
leading to these basic ingredients of
life forms

1878
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:47,919
life forms
 

1879
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,830
life forms
and what are these basic ingredients

1880
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:49,840
and what are these basic ingredients
 

1881
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,269
and what are these basic ingredients
metabolism

1882
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:51,279
metabolism
 

1883
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,870
metabolism
being able to take energy from the

1884
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:52,880
being able to take energy from the
 

1885
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,789
being able to take energy from the
environment and put it as part of

1886
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:54,799
environment and put it as part of
 

1887
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,149
environment and put it as part of
yourself

1888
00:31:56,149 --> 00:31:56,159
yourself
 

1889
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,750
yourself
metabolism it basically means

1890
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:57,760
metabolism it basically means
 

1891
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,310
metabolism it basically means
transformation again in the greek

1892
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:02,320

 

1893
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,430

it basically means taking stuff from you

1894
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:05,440
it basically means taking stuff from you
 

1895
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:05,830
it basically means taking stuff from you
know

1896
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:05,840
know
 

1897
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,149
know
like nutrients or energy source or

1898
00:32:08,149 --> 00:32:08,159
like nutrients or energy source or
 

1899
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,909
like nutrients or energy source or
anything and then making it your own

1900
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:09,919
anything and then making it your own
 

1901
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,870
anything and then making it your own
the second one is compartmentalization

1902
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:12,880
the second one is compartmentalization
 

1903
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,070
the second one is compartmentalization
if there's no notion of

1904
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,080
if there's no notion of
 

1905
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,710
if there's no notion of
self there can't be evolution you have

1906
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:16,720
self there can't be evolution you have
 

1907
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,549
self there can't be evolution you have
to know where your own boundaries end

1908
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:18,559
to know where your own boundaries end
 

1909
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,430
to know where your own boundaries end
and where the non-self boundaries begin

1910
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:21,440
and where the non-self boundaries begin
 

1911
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,549
and where the non-self boundaries begin
and that's basically

1912
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:22,559
and that's basically
 

1913
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,190
and that's basically
the lipid bilayer nowadays which is

1914
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:25,200
the lipid bilayer nowadays which is
 

1915
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,029
the lipid bilayer nowadays which is
extremely simple to to form

1916
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:27,039
extremely simple to to form
 

1917
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,549
extremely simple to to form
it's basically just a bunch of lipids

1918
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:28,559
it's basically just a bunch of lipids
 

1919
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,750
it's basically just a bunch of lipids
and then they eventually just

1920
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:29,760
and then they eventually just
 

1921
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,750
and then they eventually just
self-organize into a membrane

1922
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:31,760
self-organize into a membrane
 

1923
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,070
self-organize into a membrane
so that's a very natural way of forming

1924
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,080
so that's a very natural way of forming
 

1925
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,750
so that's a very natural way of forming
a self

1926
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:35,760
a self
 

1927
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,310
a self
and then the third component is

1928
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:38,320
and then the third component is
 

1929
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,630
and then the third component is
replication

1930
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:40,640
replication
 

1931
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,750
replication
replication doesn't need to be

1932
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:41,760
replication doesn't need to be
 

1933
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,230
replication doesn't need to be
self-replication it could be a

1934
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:44,240
self-replication it could be a
 

1935
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,710
self-replication it could be a
helps make more of b b helps make more

1936
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:46,720
helps make more of b b helps make more
 

1937
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,509
helps make more of b b helps make more
of c

1938
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:47,519
of c
 

1939
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,389
of c
and c helps make more of a any kind of

1940
00:32:51,389 --> 00:32:51,399
and c helps make more of a any kind of
 

1941
00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:52,710
and c helps make more of a any kind of
self-reinforcement

1942
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:52,720
self-reinforcement
 

1943
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,789
self-reinforcement
is what you need to ignite the process

1944
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:54,799
is what you need to ignite the process
 

1945
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:55,990
is what you need to ignite the process
of evolution

1946
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:56,000
of evolution
 

1947
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,110
of evolution
after you've ignited that process you

1948
00:32:59,110 --> 00:32:59,120
after you've ignited that process you
 

1949
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,470
after you've ignited that process you
know i don't want to say all hell breaks

1950
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:00,480
know i don't want to say all hell breaks
 

1951
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,389
know i don't want to say all hell breaks
loose but all paradise breaks loose

1952
00:33:02,389 --> 00:33:02,399
loose but all paradise breaks loose
 

1953
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,990
loose but all paradise breaks loose
so basically you then boom you know have

1954
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:06,000
so basically you then boom you know have
 

1955
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,950
so basically you then boom you know have
life going

1956
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:06,960
life going
 

1957
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,190
life going
and the moment you have abc some kind of

1958
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:09,200
and the moment you have abc some kind of
 

1959
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,990
and the moment you have abc some kind of
thing

1960
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:10,000
thing
 

1961
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,070
thing
looping back onto a you can make

1962
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:12,080
looping back onto a you can make
 

1963
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,430
looping back onto a you can make
modifications

1964
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:13,440
modifications
 

1965
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,509
modifications
and you can improve and then you let

1966
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:15,519
and you can improve and then you let
 

1967
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:16,870
and you can improve and then you let
natural selection work

1968
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:16,880
natural selection work
 

1969
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,029
natural selection work
is there some element of that that's

1970
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:19,039
is there some element of that that's
 

1971
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,190
is there some element of that that's
like co like uh

1972
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:21,200
like co like uh
 

1973
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,909
like co like uh
like some state representation that

1974
00:33:23,909 --> 00:33:23,919
like some state representation that
 

1975
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,430
like some state representation that
stores information like

1976
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:25,440
stores information like
 

1977
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,870
stores information like
maybe i should say information

1978
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:26,880
maybe i should say information
 

1979
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,230
maybe i should say information
absolutely is that talking about the

1980
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:28,240
absolutely is that talking about the
 

1981
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:28,710
absolutely is that talking about the
part

1982
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:28,720
part
 

1983
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,389
part
we like to think of life as

1984
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:32,399
we like to think of life as
 

1985
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,669
we like to think of life as
the information propagation which is dna

1986
00:33:35,669 --> 00:33:35,679
the information propagation which is dna
 

1987
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,389
the information propagation which is dna
the messenger which is rna and then the

1988
00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:38,399
the messenger which is rna and then the
 

1989
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:39,110
the messenger which is rna and then the
action

1990
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,120
action
 

1991
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,190
action
which is protein so basically dna

1992
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:43,200
which is protein so basically dna
 

1993
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,230
which is protein so basically dna
we think is an essential part of life

1994
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:46,240
we think is an essential part of life
 

1995
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,470
we think is an essential part of life
that's where the storage is and

1996
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:48,480
that's where the storage is and
 

1997
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,070
that's where the storage is and
therefore that early life forms must

1998
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:50,080
therefore that early life forms must
 

1999
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,430
therefore that early life forms must
have had some kind of storage

2000
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:51,440
have had some kind of storage
 

2001
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,870
have had some kind of storage
medium dna if you look at how life

2002
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:54,880
medium dna if you look at how life
 

2003
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,830
medium dna if you look at how life
actually evolved dna was invented much

2004
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:57,840
actually evolved dna was invented much
 

2005
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,509
actually evolved dna was invented much
later

2006
00:33:59,509 --> 00:33:59,519
later
 

2007
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,789
later
proteins were invented later

2008
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:02,799
proteins were invented later
 

2009
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:06,070
proteins were invented later
and rna was find by itself thank you

2010
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,080
and rna was find by itself thank you
 

2011
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,190
and rna was find by itself thank you
very much

2012
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:07,200
very much
 

2013
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,710
very much
in an rna world so the early

2014
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:10,720
in an rna world so the early
 

2015
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,270
in an rna world so the early
version of life as we know it today was

2016
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:13,280
version of life as we know it today was
 

2017
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:13,829
version of life as we know it today was
in fact

2018
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:13,839
in fact
 

2019
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,710
in fact
rna molecules performing all of the

2020
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:16,720
rna molecules performing all of the
 

2021
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,829
rna molecules performing all of the
functions

2022
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:17,839
functions
 

2023
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,190
functions
the rna molecule itself was the

2024
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:21,200
the rna molecule itself was the
 

2025
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,230
the rna molecule itself was the
protein actuator by creating

2026
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:24,240
protein actuator by creating
 

2027
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,589
protein actuator by creating
three-dimensional folds

2028
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:25,599
three-dimensional folds
 

2029
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,389
three-dimensional folds
through self-hybridization itself what

2030
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:28,399
through self-hybridization itself what
 

2031
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,990
through self-hybridization itself what
self-hybridization so basically the same

2032
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:30,000
self-hybridization so basically the same
 

2033
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,349
self-hybridization so basically the same
way that dna molecules

2034
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:31,359
way that dna molecules
 

2035
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,190
way that dna molecules
can hybridize with themselves and

2036
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:33,200
can hybridize with themselves and
 

2037
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,589
can hybridize with themselves and
basically form this double helix

2038
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:35,599
basically form this double helix
 

2039
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,149
basically form this double helix
the single-stranded rna molecule can

2040
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:38,159
the single-stranded rna molecule can
 

2041
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:38,869
the single-stranded rna molecule can
form

2042
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:38,879
form
 

2043
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,829
form
partial double helixes in various places

2044
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:41,839
partial double helixes in various places
 

2045
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,190
partial double helixes in various places
creating structure

2046
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:43,200
creating structure
 

2047
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,430
creating structure
as if you had a long string with

2048
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:45,440
as if you had a long string with
 

2049
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,109
as if you had a long string with
complementary parts and you could then

2050
00:34:47,109 --> 00:34:47,119
complementary parts and you could then
 

2051
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:47,990
complementary parts and you could then
sort of design

2052
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:48,000
sort of design
 

2053
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,310
sort of design
kind of like origami-like structures

2054
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:50,320
kind of like origami-like structures
 

2055
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,230
kind of like origami-like structures
that will fall down to themselves

2056
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:52,240
that will fall down to themselves
 

2057
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,750
that will fall down to themselves
and then you can make any shape from

2058
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:53,760
and then you can make any shape from
 

2059
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,270
and then you can make any shape from
that

2060
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:55,280
that
 

2061
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,950
that
that early rna world eventually got

2062
00:34:58,950 --> 00:34:58,960
that early rna world eventually got
 

2063
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,230
that early rna world eventually got
to replication where

2064
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:02,240
to replication where
 

2065
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,470
to replication where
enzymes encoded in rna would replicate

2066
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:06,480
enzymes encoded in rna would replicate
 

2067
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,670
enzymes encoded in rna would replicate
rna itself and then

2068
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:09,680
rna itself and then
 

2069
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,829
rna itself and then
that process basically kicked off

2070
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:11,839
that process basically kicked off
 

2071
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,430
that process basically kicked off
evolution

2072
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:13,440
evolution
 

2073
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,670
evolution
and that process of evolution then led

2074
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:15,680
and that process of evolution then led
 

2075
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,510
and that process of evolution then led
to major innovations

2076
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:17,520
to major innovations
 

2077
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,950
to major innovations
the first innovation was translation

2078
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:20,960
the first innovation was translation
 

2079
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,349
the first innovation was translation
so you start with an rna molecule and

2080
00:35:23,349 --> 00:35:23,359
so you start with an rna molecule and
 

2081
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,430
so you start with an rna molecule and
you translate it into another kind of

2082
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:25,440
you translate it into another kind of
 

2083
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,710
you translate it into another kind of
form and that's the first kind of

2084
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:26,720
form and that's the first kind of
 

2085
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,910
form and that's the first kind of
encoding you're like well

2086
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:27,920
encoding you're like well
 

2087
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,230
encoding you're like well
do you need some kind of code yeah but

2088
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:30,240
do you need some kind of code yeah but
 

2089
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,109
do you need some kind of code yeah but
the code

2090
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:31,119
the code
 

2091
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,710
the code
was in fact one thing it was conflated

2092
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:34,720
was in fact one thing it was conflated
 

2093
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,069
was in fact one thing it was conflated
with the actuators the actuators were

2094
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:38,079
with the actuators the actuators were
 

2095
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,550
with the actuators the actuators were
separated from the code only later on

2096
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:40,560
separated from the code only later on
 

2097
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,150
separated from the code only later on
so you first had the self-replicating

2098
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:42,160
so you first had the self-replicating
 

2099
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,310
so you first had the self-replicating
code which was also the actuator

2100
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:44,320
code which was also the actuator
 

2101
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,990
code which was also the actuator
and then you kind of have a

2102
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:46,000
and then you kind of have a
 

2103
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,750
and then you kind of have a
functionalization

2104
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:47,760
functionalization
 

2105
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,510
functionalization
partitioning of the functionalization a

2106
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:49,520
partitioning of the functionalization a
 

2107
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,790
partitioning of the functionalization a
sub-functionalization

2108
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:50,800
sub-functionalization
 

2109
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,109
sub-functionalization
of the proteins that are now going to be

2110
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:53,119
of the proteins that are now going to be
 

2111
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,870
of the proteins that are now going to be
the workhorse of life

2112
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:54,880
the workhorse of life
 

2113
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,630
the workhorse of life
but they're not self-replicating the

2114
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:56,640
but they're not self-replicating the
 

2115
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,950
but they're not self-replicating the
code remains the rna

2116
00:35:58,950 --> 00:35:58,960
code remains the rna
 

2117
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,910
code remains the rna
so the most beautiful and most complex

2118
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:01,920
so the most beautiful and most complex
 

2119
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,950
so the most beautiful and most complex
rna machine

2120
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:02,960
rna machine
 

2121
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,829
rna machine
known to man is the ribosome the

2122
00:36:05,829 --> 00:36:05,839
known to man is the ribosome the
 

2123
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:06,790
known to man is the ribosome the
ribosome

2124
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:06,800
ribosome
 

2125
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,430
ribosome
is this massive factory that is able to

00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:09,440
is this massive factory that is able to
 

2127
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,310
is this massive factory that is able to
translate

2128
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:10,320
translate
 

2129
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,069
translate
rna into protein the ribosome

2130
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:14,079
rna into protein the ribosome
 

2131
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,589
rna into protein the ribosome
if you if you want i don't know divine

2132
00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:15,599
if you if you want i don't know divine
 

2133

intervention in the history of life

2134
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:17,359
intervention in the history of life
 

2135
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,670
intervention in the history of life
the ribosome is it that's one of the

2136
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:19,680
the ribosome is it that's one of the
 

2137
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,589
the ribosome is it that's one of the
great invention in the history of life

2138
00:36:21,589 --> 00:36:21,599
great invention in the history of life
 

2139
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,670
great invention in the history of life
it's it's yeah but again you can't think

2140
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:23,680
it's it's yeah but again you can't think
 

2141
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,870
it's it's yeah but again you can't think
of great inventions as

2142
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:24,880
of great inventions as
 

2143
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,030
of great inventions as
one one-time steps they're basically you

2144
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:27,040

that won out and then when the ribosome

2154
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:37,920
that won out and then when the ribosome
 

2155
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,150
that won out and then when the ribosome
was so efficient at making proteins

2156
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:40,160
was so efficient at making proteins
 

2157
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,470
was so efficient at making proteins
all the other ones basically died out

2158
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:42,480
all the other ones basically died out
 

2159
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,190
all the other ones basically died out
and then

2160
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:43,200
and then
 

2161
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,950
and then
the life forms that were using the

2162
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:44,960
the life forms that were using the
 

2163
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,790
the life forms that were using the
modern ribosome

2164
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:46,800
modern ribosome
 

2165
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,630
modern ribosome
were basically the more successful ones

2166
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:48,640
were basically the more successful ones
 

2167
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,390
were basically the more successful ones
because it could make proteins

2168
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:50,400
because it could make proteins
 

2169
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,430
because it could make proteins
and now those proteins are much more

2170
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:53,440
and now those proteins are much more
 

2171
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,390
and now those proteins are much more
versatile

2172
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:54,400
versatile
 

2173
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,589
versatile
because rna only has four bases proteins

2174
00:36:57,589 --> 00:36:57,599
because rna only has four bases proteins
 

2175
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,069
because rna only has four bases proteins
eventually have 20 amino acids not

2176
00:37:00,069 --> 00:37:00,079
eventually have 20 amino acids not
 

2177
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,910
eventually have 20 amino acids not
initially but eventually

2178
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:01,920
initially but eventually
 

2179
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,310

and then they can form in much more

2180
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:04,320
and then they can form in much more
 

2181
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,910
and then they can form in much more
complex shapes and they can create all

2182
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:05,920
complex shapes and they can create all
 

2183
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,990
complex shapes and they can create all
kinds of additional machines

2184
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:08,000
kinds of additional machines
 

2185
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,990
kinds of additional machines
one of which is reverse transcriptase

2186
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:12,000
one of which is reverse transcriptase
 

2187
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,950
one of which is reverse transcriptase
so you basically now have rna again we

2188
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:14,960
so you basically now have rna again we
 

2189
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,550
so you basically now have rna again we
like to think of transcription as the

2190
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:16,560
like to think of transcription as the
 

2191
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,990
like to think of transcription as the
normal reverse transcription as the

2192
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:18,000
normal reverse transcription as the
 

2193
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,109
normal reverse transcription as the
oddball

2194
00:37:19,109 --> 00:37:19,119
oddball
 

2195
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,990

well rna preceded dna so reverse

2196
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:22,000
well rna preceded dna so reverse
 

2197
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,829
well rna preceded dna so reverse
transcription actually was the first

2198
00:37:23,829 --> 00:37:23,839
transcription actually was the first
 

2199
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,470
transcription actually was the first
invention before transcription itself so

2200
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:26,480
invention before transcription itself so
 

2201
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,270
invention before transcription itself so
basically

2202
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:27,280
basically
 

2203
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,150
basically
rna invents proteins rna and proteins

2204
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:30,160
rna invents proteins rna and proteins
 

2205

2207
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,870
together
invent dna so you now have a more stable

2208
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:34,880
invent dna so you now have a more stable

00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,270
it has the shielding through the ice
sheet

2310
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:25,280
sheet
 

2311
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,589
sheet
protecting it just like an atmosphere

2312
00:39:27,589 --> 00:39:27,599
protecting it just like an atmosphere
 

2313
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,230
protecting it just like an atmosphere
would it even has a layer of oxygen

2314
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:30,240
would it even has a layer of oxygen
 

2315
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,150
would it even has a layer of oxygen
probably sufficiently dense to sustain

2316
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:32,160
probably sufficiently dense to sustain
 

2317
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,069
probably sufficiently dense to sustain
life so

2318
00:39:34,069 --> 00:39:34,079
life so
 

2319
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,990
life so
my guess is that there's probably

2320
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:38,000
my guess is that there's probably
 

2321
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,030
my guess is that there's probably
uh independently a reason

2322
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:41,040
uh independently a reason
 

2323
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,990
uh independently a reason
life form already teeming in europa

2324
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:44,000
life form already teeming in europa
 

2325
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,030
life form already teeming in europa
because as soon as it

2326
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:45,040
because as soon as it
 

2327
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,550
because as soon as it
today is that exciting or terrifying to

2328
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:48,560
today is that exciting or terrifying to
 

2329
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,430
today is that exciting or terrifying to
you

2330
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:51,440

 

2331
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,550

it's i mean as a scientist i can't wait

2332
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:54,560
it's i mean as a scientist i can't wait
 

2333
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,750
it's i mean as a scientist i can't wait
to see

2334
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:55,760
to see
 

2335
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,710
to see
non-dna based life forms i can't wait

2336
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:58,720
non-dna based life forms i can't wait
 

2337
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,270
non-dna based life forms i can't wait
because

2338
00:39:59,270 --> 00:39:59,280
because
 

2339
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,030
because
we are so born uh

2340
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:03,040
we are so born uh
 

2341
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,790
we are so born uh
in in you know sort of uh borne

2342
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:06,800
in in you know sort of uh borne
 

2343
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,390
in in you know sort of uh borne
as i would say in french but basically

00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:08,400
as i would say in french but basically
 

2345
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,230
as i would say in french but basically
we're sort of you know

2346
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:10,240
we're sort of you know
 

2347
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,030
we're sort of you know
we we we are so narrow-minded in our

00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,150
thinking
of what life should look like that i

2352
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:16,160
of what life should look like that i
 

2353
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,069
of what life should look like that i
can't wait for all that to just be blown

2354
00:40:18,069 --> 00:40:18,079
can't wait for all that to just be blown
 

2355
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:18,790
can't wait for all that to just be blown
away

2356
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:18,800

00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:21,280
by the discovery of life elsewhere let
 

2359
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,630
by the discovery of life elsewhere let
me bring you into another science

2360
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:22,640
me bring you into another science
 

2361
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,349
me bring you into another science
fiction

2362
00:40:23,349 --> 00:40:23,359
fiction
 

2363
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:27,030
fiction
uh it's a scenario so on that point

2364
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:27,040
uh it's a scenario so on that point
 

2365
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,230
uh it's a scenario so on that point
if we discover life on europa

2366
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:30,240
if we discover life on europa
 

2367
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,510
if we discover life on europa
and you were brought in

2368
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:33,520
and you were brought in
 

2369
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,710
and you were brought in
you seem very excited but

2370
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:36,720
you seem very excited but
 

2371
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,069
you seem very excited but
how would you start looking at that life

2372
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:40,079
how would you start looking at that life
 

2373
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,950
how would you start looking at that life
in a way that's useful to you as a

2374
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:42,960
in a way that's useful to you as a
 

2375
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,990
in a way that's useful to you as a
scientist

2376
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:44,000
scientist
 

2377
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,510
scientist
but also not going to kill all of us

2378
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:47,520
but also not going to kill all of us
 

2379
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,109
but also not going to kill all of us
so like to me it's a little bit scary

2380
00:40:51,109 --> 00:40:51,119
so like to me it's a little bit scary
 

2381
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,030
so like to me it's a little bit scary
because not not because it's a

2382
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:53,040
because not not because it's a
 

2383
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,870
because not not because it's a
malevolent life like it's a

2384
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:54,880
malevolent life like it's a
 

2385
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,510
malevolent life like it's a
it's a dictator petting like a cat it's

2386
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:57,520
it's a dictator petting like a cat it's
 

2387
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,230
it's a dictator petting like a cat it's
evil

2388
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:58,240
evil
 

2389
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,750
evil
but just the way life is it seems to be

2390
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:01,760
but just the way life is it seems to be
 

2391
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,550
but just the way life is it seems to be
very good

2392
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:02,560
very good
 

2393
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,109
very good
at conquering other life so there's a

2394
00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:05,119
at conquering other life so there's a
 

2395
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:06,630
at conquering other life so there's a
lot of science fiction movies based on

2396
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:06,640
lot of science fiction movies based on
 

2397
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,430
lot of science fiction movies based on
that principle

2398
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:07,440
that principle
 

2399
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,309
that principle
yeah and that's sort of what causes the

2400
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:10,319
yeah and that's sort of what causes the
 

2401
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:11,990
yeah and that's sort of what causes the
public to be so scared but if you think

2402
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:12,000
public to be so scared but if you think
 

2403
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,750
public to be so scared but if you think
about sort of

2404
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:13,760
about sort of
 

2405
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,230
about sort of
would europa life be scared of humans

2406
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:16,240
would europa life be scared of humans
 

2407
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,910
would europa life be scared of humans
coming over and taking over

2408
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:17,920
coming over and taking over
 

2409
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,910
coming over and taking over
chances are no not even like earth

2410
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:19,920
chances are no not even like earth
 

2411
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,670
chances are no not even like earth
bacteria because earth bacteria would be

2412
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:21,680
bacteria because earth bacteria would be
 

2413
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,550
bacteria because earth bacteria would be
wiped out

2414
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:22,560
wiped out
 

2415
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,430
wiped out
in an instant in this foreign world

2416
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:25,440
in an instant in this foreign world
 

2417
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,390
in an instant in this foreign world
because they don't know how to

2418
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:26,400
because they don't know how to
 

2419
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,670
because they don't know how to
metabolize

2420
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:27,680
metabolize
 

2421
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,150
metabolize
energy that doesn't come from the types

2422
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:30,160
energy that doesn't come from the types
 

2423
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,309
energy that doesn't come from the types
of energy sources that are here

2424
00:41:32,309 --> 00:41:32,319
of energy sources that are here

00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:35,270
of energy sources that are here
the levels of acidity may just kill us

2426
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:35,280
the levels of acidity may just kill us
 

2427
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:35,750
the levels of acidity may just kill us
all off

2428
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:35,760
all off
 

2429
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,829
all off
and at the same way in this in in the

2430
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:37,839
and at the same way in this in in the
 

2431
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:38,870
and at the same way in this in in the
converse way

2432
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:38,880
converse way

if you bring life from europa on earth
it'll die instantly because it's too hot

2436
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:42,960
it'll die instantly because it's too hot
 

2437
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,510
it'll die instantly because it's too hot
or because it doesn't need to know how

2438
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:45,520
or because it doesn't need to know how
 

2439
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,309
or because it doesn't need to know how
to cope with

00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:46,319
to cope with
 

2441
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,230
to cope with
i don't know the sun's radiation so

2442
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:48,240
i don't know the sun's radiation so
 

2443
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,470
i don't know the sun's radiation so
close to this completely inhabitable

2444
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:50,480
close to this completely inhabitable
 

2445
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:50,950
close to this completely inhabitable
zone

2446
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:50,960
zone
 

2447
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,069
zone
by their standards so so what we call

2448
00:41:54,069 --> 00:41:54,079
by their standards so so what we call
 

2449
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:55,109
by their standards so so what we call
the habitable zone

2450
00:41:55,109 --> 00:41:55,119
the habitable zone
 

2451
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,190
the habitable zone
might actually be the inhabitants for

00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:57,200
might actually be the inhabitants for
 

2453
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,190
might actually be the inhabitants for
them so the difference

2454
00:41:59,190 --> 00:41:59,200
them so the difference
 

2455
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,950
them so the difference
if the environments are sufficiently

00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:00,960
if the environments are sufficiently
 

2457
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,950
if the environments are sufficiently
different you think we'll just

00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,030
different you think we'll just
not be able to even attack each other

00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:05,040
not be able to even attack each other

00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,990
not be able to even attack each other

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,069
and a basic
uh it'll take massive amounts of

00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:08,079
uh it'll take massive amounts of
 

2465
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,910
uh it'll take massive amounts of
engineering to create

2466

engineering to create
 

2467
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,309

the you know oceans basically drill

2470
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:16,800

2471
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,829
the you know oceans basically drill
through

2472
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:17,839
through
 

2473
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,630
through
the layers of ice to basically sample

2474
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:20,640
the layers of ice to basically sample
 

2475
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,430
the layers of ice to basically sample
and see

2476
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:21,440
and see
 

2477
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,430
and see
what life is like there and detecting it

2478
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:25,440
what life is like there and detecting it
 

2479
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,750
what life is like there and detecting it
will probably be trivial it definitely

2480
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:27,760
will probably be trivial it definitely
 

2481
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,190
will probably be trivial it definitely
won't be dna based it's not like we're

2482
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:29,200
won't be dna based it's not like we're
 

2483
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,950
won't be dna based it's not like we're
going to send a sequencer

2484
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:30,960
going to send a sequencer
 

2485
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,829
going to send a sequencer
but it'll be you know some other kind of

2486
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:33,839
but it'll be you know some other kind of
 

2487
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,510
but it'll be you know some other kind of
combination of chemicals that will look

2488
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:35,520
combination of chemicals that will look
 

2489
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,230
combination of chemicals that will look
non-random

2490
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:36,240
non-random
 

2491
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,950
non-random
so if you had to bet if i took that life

2492
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:38,960
so if you had to bet if i took that life
 

2493
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,390
so if you had to bet if i took that life
form we find on

2494
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:40,400
form we find on
 

2495
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,630
form we find on
europa and like put it on a sandwich

2496
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:42,640
europa and like put it on a sandwich
 

2497
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,790
europa and like put it on a sandwich
that you're eating and like eat that

2498
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:44,800
that you're eating and like eat that
 

2499
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,589
that you're eating and like eat that
sandwich

2500
00:42:45,589 --> 00:42:45,599
sandwich
 

2501
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,309
sandwich
it'll taste just fine and you'll be well

2502
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:48,319
it'll taste just fine and you'll be well
 

2503
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:48,870
it'll taste just fine and you'll be well
i

2504
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:48,880
i
 

2505
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,710
i
don't know about that i don't know

2506
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:50,720
don't know about that i don't know
 

2507
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,309
don't know about that i don't know
anyone well it tastes fine that's

2508
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:52,319
anyone well it tastes fine that's
 

2509
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,190
anyone well it tastes fine that's
interesting so

2510
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:53,200
interesting so
 

2511
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,950
interesting so
the other question is do we have taste

2512
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:54,960
the other question is do we have taste
 

2513
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,589
the other question is do we have taste
receptors for this

2514
00:42:59,589 --> 00:42:59,599

 

2515
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,910

adaptations to chemical molecules that

2516
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:01,920
adaptations to chemical molecules that
 

2517
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,109
adaptations to chemical molecules that
we are used to seeing

2518
00:43:03,109 --> 00:43:03,119
we are used to seeing
 

2519
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,710
we are used to seeing
so you think we don't have case bugs for

2520
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:04,720
so you think we don't have case bugs for
 

2521
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,550
so you think we don't have case bugs for
things we don't even know about wow so

2522
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:06,560
things we don't even know about wow so
 

2523
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,829
things we don't even know about wow so
we won't yeah we want to be able to know

2524
00:43:07,829 --> 00:43:07,839
we won't yeah we want to be able to know
 

2525
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:09,430
we won't yeah we want to be able to know
that this chemical tastes funny

2526
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:09,440
that this chemical tastes funny
 

2527
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,670
that this chemical tastes funny
but you think it won't be it's likely

2528
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:11,680
but you think it won't be it's likely
 

2529
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,109
but you think it won't be it's likely
not to be dangerous

2530
00:43:13,109 --> 00:43:13,119
not to be dangerous
 

2531
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,150
not to be dangerous
like it won't know how to even interrupt

2532
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:16,160
like it won't know how to even interrupt
 

2533
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,230
like it won't know how to even interrupt
do you think our immune system will

2534
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:18,240
do you think our immune system will
 

2535
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,630
do you think our immune system will
will even detect that something weird is

2536
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:20,640
will even detect that something weird is
 

2537
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,069
will even detect that something weird is
probably

2538
00:43:22,069 --> 00:43:22,079
probably
 

2539
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,069
probably
and it'll be very easy to detect because

2540
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:24,079
and it'll be very easy to detect because
 

2541
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:25,589
and it'll be very easy to detect because
it'll be very different from very weird

2542
00:43:25,589 --> 00:43:25,599
it'll be very different from very weird
 

2543
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,030
it'll be very different from very weird
but it won't be able to sort of

2544
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,040
but it won't be able to sort of
 

2545
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,870
but it won't be able to sort of
attack i mean the scene from i don't

2546
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:28,880
attack i mean the scene from i don't
 

2547
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,069
attack i mean the scene from i don't
know independence day

2548
00:43:30,069 --> 00:43:30,079
know independence day
 

2549
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:31,430
know independence day
where like they're communicating with

2550
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:31,440
where like they're communicating with
 

2551
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,630
where like they're communicating with
the other computer and they're like ooh

2552
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:32,640
the other computer and they're like ooh
 

2553
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,069
the other computer and they're like ooh
i'm in

2554
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:34,079
i'm in
 

2555
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,150
i'm in
i mean it's hilarious because like macs

2556
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:36,160
i mean it's hilarious because like macs
 

2557
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,910
i mean it's hilarious because like macs
and pcs have trouble communicating

2558
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:39,920

 

2559
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,829

i mean let alone an alien technology or

2560
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:41,839
i mean let alone an alien technology or
 

2561
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:43,190
i mean let alone an alien technology or
even alien dna

2562
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:43,200
even alien dna
 

2563
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,829
even alien dna
so okay uh now i was talking about you

2564
00:43:45,829 --> 00:43:45,839
so okay uh now i was talking about you
 

2565
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,510
so okay uh now i was talking about you
being a scientist on earth but

2566
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:47,520
being a scientist on earth but
 

2567
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,430
being a scientist on earth but
say you were a scientist uh they were

2568
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:49,440
say you were a scientist uh they were
 

2569
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,270
say you were a scientist uh they were
shipped over to europa

2570
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:51,280
shipped over to europa
 

2571
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,190
shipped over to europa
to investigate if there's life what

2572
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:53,200
to investigate if there's life what
 

2573
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,550
to investigate if there's life what
would you look for

2574
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:54,560
would you look for
 

2575
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,589
would you look for
in terms of signs of life

2576
00:43:57,589 --> 00:43:57,599
in terms of signs of life
 

2577
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,710
in terms of signs of life
life is unmistakable i would say

2578
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:00,720
life is unmistakable i would say
 

2579
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,430
life is unmistakable i would say
the way that life transforms a planet

2580
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:03,440
the way that life transforms a planet
 

2581
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,790
the way that life transforms a planet
surrounding it

2582
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:04,800
surrounding it
 

2583
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,870
surrounding it
is not the kind of thing that you would

2584
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:06,880
is not the kind of thing that you would
 

2585
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,990
is not the kind of thing that you would
expect from the physical

2586
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:08,000
expect from the physical
 

2587
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,190
expect from the physical
laws alone so it's

2588
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:11,200
laws alone so it's
 

2589
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,550
laws alone so it's
i would say that as soon as life

2590
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:14,560
i would say that as soon as life
 

2591
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,670
i would say that as soon as life
arises it creates this

2592
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:16,680
arises it creates this
 

2593
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,150
arises it creates this
compartmentalization

2594
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:18,160
compartmentalization
 

2595
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,870
compartmentalization
it starts pushing things away it starts

2596
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:20,880
it starts pushing things away it starts
 

2597
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,470
it starts pushing things away it starts
sort of keeping things inside that

2598
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:22,480
sort of keeping things inside that
 

2599
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,510
sort of keeping things inside that
herself

2600
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:23,520
herself
 

2601
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,630
herself
and there's a whole signature

2602
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:26,640
and there's a whole signature
 

2603
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,430
and there's a whole signature
that you can see from that so when i was

2604
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:29,440
that you can see from that so when i was
 

2605
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,109
that you can see from that so when i was
organizing my meaning of life symposium

2606
00:44:31,109 --> 00:44:31,119
organizing my meaning of life symposium
 

2607
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,390
organizing my meaning of life symposium
my my my friend was an astrophysicist um

2608
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:34,400
my my my friend was an astrophysicist um
 

2609
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,870
my my my friend was an astrophysicist um
basically uh we were deciding on what

2610
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:36,880
basically uh we were deciding on what
 

2611
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,829
basically uh we were deciding on what
would be the themes

2612
00:44:37,829 --> 00:44:37,839
would be the themes
 

2613
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:40,390
would be the themes
for the for the symposium and then uh i

2614
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:40,400
for the for the symposium and then uh i
 

2615
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,750
for the for the symposium and then uh i
said well we're going to have biology

2616
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:41,760
said well we're going to have biology
 

2617
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,710
said well we're going to have biology
we're going to have physics and she's

2618
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:42,720
we're going to have physics and she's
 

2619
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,750
we're going to have physics and she's
like

2620
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:43,760
like
 

2621
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,829
like
come on biology is just a small part of

2622
00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:45,839
come on biology is just a small part of
 

2623
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:46,300
come on biology is just a small part of
physics

2624
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:46,310
physics
 

2625
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:48,630
physics
[Laughter]

2626
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:48,640
[Laughter]
 

2627
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,309
[Laughter]
everything is a small part of physics

2628
00:44:50,309 --> 00:44:50,319
everything is a small part of physics
 

2629
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:51,750
everything is a small part of physics
and uh i mean

2630
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:51,760
and uh i mean
 

2631
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,309
and uh i mean

life challenges physics it supersedes

2636
00:44:59,589 --> 00:44:59,599
life challenges physics it supersedes
 

2637
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:00,150
life challenges physics it supersedes
physics

2638
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:00,160
physics
 

2639
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,349
physics
it sort of fights against physics

2640
00:45:03,349 --> 00:45:03,359
it sort of fights against physics
 

2641
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,790
it sort of fights against physics
and that's what i would look for in

2642
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:04,800
and that's what i would look for in
 

2643
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,710
and that's what i would look for in
europa i would basically look for this

2644
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:06,720
europa i would basically look for this
 

2645
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,270
europa i would basically look for this
fight against physics for anything that

2646
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:09,280
fight against physics for anything that
 

2647
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:09,990
fight against physics for anything that
sort of

2648
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:10,000
sort of
 

2649
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,309
sort of
signatures of not just entropy at work

2650
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:12,319
signatures of not just entropy at work
 

2651
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,750
signatures of not just entropy at work
not just things diffusing away

2652
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:13,760
not just things diffusing away
 

2653
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,109
not just things diffusing away
not just gravitational pulls but

2654
00:45:17,109 --> 00:45:17,119
not just gravitational pulls but
 

2655
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,829
not just gravitational pulls but
clear signatures of you remember when i

2656
00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:19,839
clear signatures of you remember when i
 

2657
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:21,270
clear signatures of you remember when i
was talking earlier about this whole

2658
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:21,280
was talking earlier about this whole
 

2659
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,190
was talking earlier about this whole
selection for environment selection for

00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:23,200
selection for environment selection for
 

2661
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,190
selection for environment selection for
biospheres for ecosystems

2662
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:25,200
biospheres for ecosystems
 

2663
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,790
biospheres for ecosystems
for this multi-organism form

2664
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:28,800
for this multi-organism form
 

2665
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,870
for this multi-organism form
of life and i think that's sort of the

2666
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:30,880
of life and i think that's sort of the
 

2667
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,190
of life and i think that's sort of the
the first thing that you can look for

2668
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:33,200
the first thing that you can look for
 

2669
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,030
the first thing that you can look for
you know chemical signatures that are

2670
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:35,040
you know chemical signatures that are
 

2671
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,710
you know chemical signatures that are
not simply predicted

2672
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:36,720
not simply predicted
 

2673
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,150
not simply predicted
from the reactions you would get

2674
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:38,160
from the reactions you would get
 

2675
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,910
from the reactions you would get
randomly such a beautiful

2676
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:39,920
randomly such a beautiful
 

2677
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,990
randomly such a beautiful
way to look at life so you're basically

2678
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:42,000
way to look at life so you're basically
 

2679
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,630
way to look at life so you're basically
leveraging some energy source

2680
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:44,640
leveraging some energy source
 

2681
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,270
leveraging some energy source
to enable you to resist the physics of

2682
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:47,280
to enable you to resist the physics of
 

2683
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,069
to enable you to resist the physics of
the universe

2684
00:45:48,069 --> 00:45:48,079
the universe
 

2685
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,230
the universe
fighting against physics but that's

2686
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:50,240
fighting against physics but that's
 

2687
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,670
fighting against physics but that's
that's the first transformation if you

2688
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:51,680
that's the first transformation if you
 

2689
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,710
that's the first transformation if you
look at humans

2690
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:52,720
look at humans
 

2691
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,550
look at humans
we're way past that what do you mean by

2692
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:54,560
we're way past that what do you mean by
 

2693
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,230
we're way past that what do you mean by
transformation so so

2694
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:56,240
transformation so so
 

2695
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,150
transformation so so
basically there's there's layers i sort

2696
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:58,160
basically there's there's layers i sort
 

2697
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,270
basically there's there's layers i sort
of see

2698
00:45:59,270 --> 00:45:59,280
of see
 

2699
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,109
of see
life you know when we talk about the

2700
00:46:03,109 --> 00:46:03,119
life you know when we talk about the
 

2701
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,230
life you know when we talk about the
meaning of life

2702
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:04,240
meaning of life
 

2703
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,109
meaning of life
life can be construed at many levels we

2704
00:46:07,109 --> 00:46:07,119
life can be construed at many levels we
 

2705
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:07,670
life can be construed at many levels we
talked about

2706
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:07,680
talked about
 

2707
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,990
talked about
life in the simplest form of sort of the

2708
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:10,000
life in the simplest form of sort of the
 

2709
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,870
life in the simplest form of sort of the
ignition

of evolution and that's sort of the

2712
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:12,640
of evolution and that's sort of the
 

2713
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,550
of evolution and that's sort of the
basic definition that you can check off

00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:14,560
basic definition that you can check off
 

2715
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:14,870
basic definition that you can check off
yes

2716
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:14,880
yes
 

2717
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,910
yes
it's alive but when alexander the great

2718
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:17,920
it's alive but when alexander the great
 

2719
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,309
it's alive but when alexander the great
was asked to whom do you owe

2720
00:46:22,309 --> 00:46:22,319
was asked to whom do you owe
 

2721
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:25,910
was asked to whom do you owe
your life to your teachers

2722
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:25,920
your life to your teachers
 

2723
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,870
your life to your teachers
or to your parents and alexander the

2724
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:28,880
or to your parents and alexander the
 

2725
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,349
or to your parents and alexander the
great

2726
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:29,359
great
 

2727
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:33,109
great
uh answered i owe to my parents

2728
00:46:33,109 --> 00:46:33,119
uh answered i owe to my parents
 

2729
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,630
uh answered i owe to my parents
the zine the life itself and i owe to my

2730
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:36,640
the zine the life itself and i owe to my
 

2731
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,670
the zine the life itself and i owe to my
teachers the

2732
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:37,680
teachers the
 

2733
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,190
teachers the
f zine like euphony f means good

2734
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:41,200
f zine like euphony f means good
 

2735
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,190
f zine like euphony f means good
the opposite of cacophony which means

2736
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:43,200
the opposite of cacophony which means
 

2737
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,230
the opposite of cacophony which means
you know bad

2738
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:44,240
you know bad
 

2739
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,150
you know bad
so f zine in his

2740
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:48,160
so f zine in his
 

2741
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,670
so f zine in his
uh words was basically living

2742
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:51,680
uh words was basically living
 

2743
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,150
uh words was basically living
a human life a proper life so basically

2744
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:54,160
a human life a proper life so basically
 

2745
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,670
a human life a proper life so basically
we can go from the zine to the f-zine

2746
00:46:57,670 --> 00:46:57,680
we can go from the zine to the f-zine
 

2747
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,790
we can go from the zine to the f-zine
and that transformation has taken

2748
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:00,800
and that transformation has taken
 

2749
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,910
and that transformation has taken
several additional leaps so basically

2750
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:03,920
several additional leaps so basically
 

2751
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,069
several additional leaps so basically
you know life on europa i'm pretty sure

2752
00:47:06,069 --> 00:47:06,079
you know life on europa i'm pretty sure
 

2753
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:07,510
you know life on europa i'm pretty sure
has gotten to the stage of

2754
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:07,520
has gotten to the stage of
 

2755
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,510
has gotten to the stage of
a makes b makes c makes a again

2756
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:11,520
a makes b makes c makes a again
 

2757
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,069
a makes b makes c makes a again
but getting to the f zine is a whole

2758
00:47:14,069 --> 00:47:14,079
but getting to the f zine is a whole
 

2759
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:15,670
but getting to the f zine is a whole
other

00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:15,680
other
 

2761
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,430
other
level and that level requires

2762
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:19,440
level and that level requires
 

2763
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,829
level and that level requires
cooperation that level requires

2764
00:47:22,829 --> 00:47:22,839
cooperation that level requires
 

2765
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,589
cooperation that level requires
altruism that level requires

2766
00:47:25,589 --> 00:47:25,599
altruism that level requires
 

2767
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:26,950
altruism that level requires
specialization

2768
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:26,960
specialization
 

2769
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,030
specialization
remember how we're talking about the rna

2770
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:29,040
remember how we're talking about the rna
 

2771
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,430
remember how we're talking about the rna
specializing into dna for storage

2772
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:31,440
specializing into dna for storage
 

2773
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,710
specializing into dna for storage
proteins and then compartmentalizations

2774
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:34,720
proteins and then compartmentalizations
 

2775
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,190
proteins and then compartmentalizations
and if you look at prokaryotic life

2776
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:37,200
and if you look at prokaryotic life
 

2777
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,710
and if you look at prokaryotic life
there's no nucleus

2778
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:38,720
there's no nucleus
 

2779
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,309
there's no nucleus
it's all one soup of things

2780
00:47:40,309 --> 00:47:40,319
it's all one soup of things
 

2781
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,190
it's all one soup of things
intermingling if you look at

2782
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:43,200
intermingling if you look at
 

2783
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,390
intermingling if you look at
eukaryotic life again you for true

2784
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:46,400
eukaryotic life again you for true
 

2785
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,910
eukaryotic life again you for true
good you know so a eukaryote

2786
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:49,920
good you know so a eukaryote
 

2787
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,510
good you know so a eukaryote
basically has a nucleus and that's where

2788
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:51,520
basically has a nucleus and that's where
 

2789
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,670
basically has a nucleus and that's where
you compartmentalize further

2790
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:53,680
you compartmentalize further
 

2791
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,549
you compartmentalize further
the organization of the information

2792
00:47:56,549 --> 00:47:56,559
the organization of the information
 

2793
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:57,430

00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,670
storage
from all of the daily activities if you

2796
00:47:59,670 --> 00:47:59,680
from all of the daily activities if you
 

2797
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,589
from all of the daily activities if you
look at a you know human body plan or

2798
00:48:01,589 --> 00:48:01,599
look at a you know human body plan or
 

2799
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:02,549
look at a you know human body plan or
any animal

2800
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:02,559
any animal
 

2801
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,069
any animal
you have a comparablization of the

2802
00:48:04,069 --> 00:48:04,079
you have a comparablization of the
 

2803
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:05,990
you have a comparablization of the
germline you basically have

2804
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:06,000
germline you basically have
 

2805
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,309
germline you basically have
one lineage that will basically be saved

2806
00:48:08,309 --> 00:48:08,319
one lineage that will basically be saved
 

2807
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:09,829
one lineage that will basically be saved
for the future generations

2808
00:48:09,829 --> 00:48:09,839
for the future generations
 

2809
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,750
for the future generations
and everything outside that lineage is

2810
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:11,760
and everything outside that lineage is
 

2811
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,150
and everything outside that lineage is
almost superfluous

2812
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:14,160
almost superfluous
 

2813
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,750
almost superfluous
if you think about it the rest of your

2814
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:15,760
if you think about it the rest of your
 

2815
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,829
if you think about it the rest of your
body all it does

2816
00:48:17,829 --> 00:48:17,839
body all it does
 

2817
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,309
body all it does
is ensure that that lineage will make it

2818
00:48:20,309 --> 00:48:20,319
is ensure that that lineage will make it
 

2819
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:21,430
is ensure that that lineage will make it
to the next generation

2820
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:21,440
to the next generation
 

2821
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,349
to the next generation
that these germ lines will make to the

2822
00:48:23,349 --> 00:48:23,359
that these germ lines will make to the
 

2823
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,510
that these germ lines will make to the
next generation the rest is packaging

2824
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:25,520
next generation the rest is packaging
 

2825
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,589
next generation the rest is packaging
i'm sorry to be so blunt yeah and if you

2826
00:48:27,589 --> 00:48:27,599
i'm sorry to be so blunt yeah and if you
 

2827
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,190
i'm sorry to be so blunt yeah and if you
look at nutrition

2828
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:29,200
look at nutrition
 

2829
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,190
look at nutrition
you know where deterostomes what does

2830
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:31,200
you know where deterostomes what does
 

2831
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,230
you know where deterostomes what does
the stone mean

2832
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:32,240
the stone mean
 

2833
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,430
the stone mean
dertero means second where

2834
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:35,440
dertero means second where
 

2835
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,349
dertero means second where
this is the second mouth the first mouth

2836
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:37,359
this is the second mouth the first mouth
 

2837
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,750
this is the second mouth the first mouth
is actually down here is the esophagus

2838
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:39,760
is actually down here is the esophagus
 

2839
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,150
is actually down here is the esophagus
so dirt or stones have evolved a second

2840
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:42,160
so dirt or stones have evolved a second
 

2841
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,910
so dirt or stones have evolved a second
layer of eating kind of like alien with

2842
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:43,920
layer of eating kind of like alien with
 

2843
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,950
layer of eating kind of like alien with
the two mouths

2844
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:44,960
the two mouths
 

2845
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,430
the two mouths
yeah so you can think of us as alien

2846
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:47,440
yeah so you can think of us as alien
 

2847
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,190
yeah so you can think of us as alien
where the first mouth is up here

2848
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:49,200
where the first mouth is up here
 

2849
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,190
where the first mouth is up here
and then the second mouth is down there

2850
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:51,200
and then the second mouth is down there
 

2851
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,430
and then the second mouth is down there
is of course is the first mouth just the

2852
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:53,440
is of course is the first mouth just the
 

2853
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,270
is of course is the first mouth just the
the the physical manipulation of the

2854
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:55,280
the the physical manipulation of the
 

2855
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,870
the the physical manipulation of the
food to make it more correct

2856
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:56,880
food to make it more correct
 

2857
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,270
food to make it more correct
correct and basically again you know if

2858
00:48:59,270 --> 00:48:59,280
correct and basically again you know if
 

2859
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,109
correct and basically again you know if
you look at if you look at a worm

2860
00:49:01,109 --> 00:49:01,119
you look at if you look at a worm
 

2861
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:02,790
you look at if you look at a worm
it's an extremely simple life form it

2862
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:02,800
it's an extremely simple life form it
 

2863
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,109
it's an extremely simple life form it
basically has a mouth it has an anus

2864
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:05,119
basically has a mouth it has an anus
 

2865
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,870
basically has a mouth it has an anus
and it has you know just some organs in

2866
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:06,880
and it has you know just some organs in
 

2867
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,309
and it has you know just some organs in
between that consume the food and just

2868
00:49:08,309 --> 00:49:08,319
between that consume the food and just
 

2869
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:10,790
between that consume the food and just
spit spit out poo

2870
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:10,800
spit spit out poo
 

2871
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,190
spit spit out poo
humans are basically a fancy form of

2872
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:13,200
humans are basically a fancy form of
 

2873
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,230
humans are basically a fancy form of
that

2874
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:14,240
that
 

2875
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,150
that
so you basically have the mouth you have

2876
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:16,160
so you basically have the mouth you have
 

2877
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,589
so you basically have the mouth you have
the digestive tract

2878
00:49:17,589 --> 00:49:17,599
the digestive tract
 

2879
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,190
the digestive tract
and then you have limbs to get better at

2880
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:19,200
and then you have limbs to get better at
 

2881
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,190
and then you have limbs to get better at
getting food you have

2882
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:21,200
getting food you have
 

2883
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,430
getting food you have
eyesight hearing etc to get better

2884
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:23,440
eyesight hearing etc to get better
 

2885
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,630
eyesight hearing etc to get better
getting food

2886
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:24,640
getting food
 

2887
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,910
getting food
yeah and then you have of course the

2888
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:25,920
yeah and then you have of course the
 

2889
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,470
yeah and then you have of course the
germline and all of this food part

2890
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:28,480
germline and all of this food part
 

2891
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,790
germline and all of this food part
it's just auxiliary to their germline so

2892
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:30,800
it's just auxiliary to their germline so
 

2893
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,230
it's just auxiliary to their germline so
you basically have layers of

2894
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:32,240
you basically have layers of
 

2895
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,710
you basically have layers of
addition of comparablization of

2896
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:34,720
addition of comparablization of
 

2897
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,230
addition of comparablization of
specialization

2898
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:36,240
specialization
 

2899
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,549
specialization
on top of this zine to get all the way

2900
00:49:38,549 --> 00:49:38,559
on top of this zine to get all the way
 

2901
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,750
on top of this zine to get all the way
to the earth scene

2902
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:39,760
to the earth scene
 

2903
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,470
to the earth scene
yeah so like the warm is like windows 95

2904
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:42,480
yeah so like the warm is like windows 95
 

2905
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,589
yeah so like the warm is like windows 95
very few features

2906
00:49:43,589 --> 00:49:43,599
very few features
 

2907
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:46,549
very few features
very basic and then us humans are like

2908
00:49:46,549 --> 00:49:46,559
very basic and then us humans are like
 

2909
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,710
very basic and then us humans are like
windows vista or windows 10 whatever it

2910
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:48,720
windows vista or windows 10 whatever it
 

2911
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:48,950
windows vista or windows 10 whatever it
is

2912
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:48,960
is
 

2913
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,670
is
well a few innovations beyond that but

2914
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:51,680
well a few innovations beyond that but
 

2915
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,030
well a few innovations beyond that but
yeah and then all right

2916
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:53,040
yeah and then all right
 

2917
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,030
yeah and then all right
where i don't know where windows 3000 at

2918
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:55,040
where i don't know where windows 3000 at
 

2919
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:59,190
where i don't know where windows 3000 at
least is such a fascinating way to look

2920
00:49:59,190 --> 00:49:59,200
least is such a fascinating way to look
 

2921
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,430
least is such a fascinating way to look
at life as a set of transformations

2922
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:01,440
at life as a set of transformations
 

2923
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,349
at life as a set of transformations
exactly so like is there some

2924
00:50:03,349 --> 00:50:03,359
exactly so like is there some
 

2925
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:05,589
exactly so like is there some
interesting transformations to our

2926
00:50:05,589 --> 00:50:05,599
interesting transformations to our
 

2927
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:07,990
interesting transformations to our
history here on earth that like appeal

2928
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:08,000
history here on earth that like appeal
 

2929
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,270
history here on earth that like appeal
to you of course so

2930
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:09,280
to you of course so
 

2931
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,710
to you of course so
and what are the most brilliant

2932
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:10,720
and what are the most brilliant
 

2933
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,630
and what are the most brilliant
innovations and transformations yeah

2934
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:12,640
innovations and transformations yeah
 

2935
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,470
innovations and transformations yeah
yeah yeah i mean this is such a

2936
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:14,480
yeah yeah i mean this is such a
 

2937
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,829
yeah yeah i mean this is such a
fascinating question of course

2938
00:50:15,829 --> 00:50:15,839
fascinating question of course
 

2939
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:17,349
fascinating question of course
like you know we're talking about basic

2940
00:50:17,349 --> 00:50:17,359
like you know we're talking about basic
 

2941
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:18,790
like you know we're talking about basic
basic life forms and we'll talk about

2942
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:18,800
basic life forms and we'll talk about
 

2943
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,549
basic life forms and we'll talk about
eukaryotic life forms

2944
00:50:20,549 --> 00:50:20,559
eukaryotic life forms
 

2945
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,870
eukaryotic life forms
and then the next big transformation is

2946
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:22,880
and then the next big transformation is
 

2947
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,710
and then the next big transformation is
multicellular life forms

2948
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:24,720
multicellular life forms
 

2949
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,270
multicellular life forms
where the specialization separates the

2950
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:27,280
where the specialization separates the
 

2951
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,309
where the specialization separates the
germ line

2952
00:50:28,309 --> 00:50:28,319
germ line
 

2953
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:30,470
germ line
from everything else that accompanies it

2954
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:30,480
from everything else that accompanies it
 

2955
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,990
from everything else that accompanies it
and sort of carries it

2956
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:32,000
and sort of carries it
 

2957
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,670
and sort of carries it
and then that specialization then sort

2958
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:33,680
and then that specialization then sort
 

2959
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,430
and then that specialization then sort
of has this

2960
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:35,440
of has this
 

2961
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,750
of has this
massive new innovation like above the

2962
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:37,760
massive new innovation like above the
 

2963
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,790
massive new innovation like above the
second mouth

2964
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:38,800
second mouth
 

2965
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,030
second mouth
which is this massive brain and this

2966
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:41,040
which is this massive brain and this
 

2967
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,069
which is this massive brain and this
massive brain

2968
00:50:42,069 --> 00:50:42,079
massive brain
 

2969
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:45,430
massive brain
is basically something that arises

2970
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:45,440
is basically something that arises
 

2971
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,510
is basically something that arises
much much later on basically you know

2972
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:47,520
much much later on basically you know
 

2973
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,510
much much later on basically you know
notochords like having the first spinal

2974
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:49,520
notochords like having the first spinal
 

2975
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:49,990
notochords like having the first spinal
cord

2976
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:50,000
cord
 

2977
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,549
cord
this whole concept that along with the

2978
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:52,559
this whole concept that along with the
 

2979
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:53,670
this whole concept that along with the
this very simple

2980
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:53,680
this very simple
 

2981
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,750
this very simple
layers you basically now have a

2982
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:55,760
layers you basically now have a
 

2983
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,430
layers you basically now have a
coordinating agent

2984
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:57,440
coordinating agent
 

2985
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,270
coordinating agent
and this coordinating agent is starting

2986
00:50:59,270 --> 00:50:59,280
and this coordinating agent is starting
 

2987
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,790
and this coordinating agent is starting
to make decisions

2988
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:00,800
to make decisions
 

2989
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,109
to make decisions
and remember when we're talking about uh

2990
00:51:03,109 --> 00:51:03,119
and remember when we're talking about uh
 

2991
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:04,390
and remember when we're talking about uh
free will

2992
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:04,400
free will
 

2993
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,950
free will
i mean you know as a worm is hunting for

2994
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:06,960
i mean you know as a worm is hunting for
 

2995
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:07,430
i mean you know as a worm is hunting for
food

2996
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:07,440
food
 

2997
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,670
food
oh it has plenty of free will it can

2998
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:09,680
oh it has plenty of free will it can
 

2999
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,710
oh it has plenty of free will it can
choose to you know

3000
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:10,720
choose to you know
 

3001
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,150
choose to you know
follow chemotaxis to the left for

3002
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:12,160
follow chemotaxis to the left for
 

3003
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,309
follow chemotaxis to the left for
chemotaxis to the right and maybe that's

3004
00:51:14,309 --> 00:51:14,319
chemotaxis to the right and maybe that's
 

3005
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,069
chemotaxis to the right and maybe that's
free will because it's unpredictable

3006
00:51:16,069 --> 00:51:16,079
free will because it's unpredictable
 

3007
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:19,589
free will because it's unpredictable
beyond a certain level so you basically

3008
00:51:19,589 --> 00:51:19,599
beyond a certain level so you basically
 

3009
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:21,109
beyond a certain level so you basically
now have

3010
00:51:21,109 --> 00:51:21,119
now have
 

3011
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,150
now have
more and more decision making and

3012
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:24,160
more and more decision making and
 

3013
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,630
more and more decision making and
coordination of all of these different

3014
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:26,640
coordination of all of these different
 

3015
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,230
coordination of all of these different
body parts and organs

3016
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:28,240
body parts and organs
 

3017
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,230

00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:32,720
machine that basically will control
 

3021
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,510
machine that basically will control
the rest of the body and the other thing

3022
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:35,520
the rest of the body and the other thing
 

3023
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:35,990
the rest of the body and the other thing
that i

love talking about is the different time
 

3027
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,109
love talking about is the different time
scales at which things happen

3028
00:51:39,109 --> 00:51:39,119
scales at which things happen
 

3029
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:40,150
scales at which things happen
you know we're talking about the human

3030
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:40,160
you know we're talking about the human
 

3031
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,870
you know we're talking about the human
epi genome before the human epigenome is

3032
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:42,880
epi genome before the human epigenome is
 

3033
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,670
epi genome before the human epigenome is
basically able to find

3034
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:45,680
basically able to find
 

3035
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,910
basically able to find
what genes should be expressed in

3036
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:47,920
what genes should be expressed in
 

3037
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,870
what genes should be expressed in
response to environmental stimuli

3038
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:50,880
response to environmental stimuli
 

3039
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,349
response to environmental stimuli
in the order of minutes and basically

3040
00:51:53,349 --> 00:51:53,359
in the order of minutes and basically
 

3041
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:54,630
in the order of minutes and basically
receive a stimulus

3042
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:54,640
receive a stimulus
 

3043
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,790
receive a stimulus
transfer all that data through this

3044
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:56,800
transfer all that data through this
 

3045
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,710
transfer all that data through this
humongously long string

3046
00:51:58,710 --> 00:51:58,720
humongously long string
 

3047
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,510
humongously long string
of searching and then sort of find what

3048
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:01,520
of searching and then sort of find what
 

3049
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,870
of searching and then sort of find what
genes to turn on

3050
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:02,880
genes to turn on
 

3051
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,030
genes to turn on
and then create all that all of that is

3052
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:05,040
and then create all that all of that is
 

3053
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,470
and then create all that all of that is
happening in the time scale of

3054
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:06,480
happening in the time scale of
 

3055
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,470
happening in the time scale of
minutes basically you know three minutes

3056
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:08,480
minutes basically you know three minutes
 

3057
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,470
minutes basically you know three minutes
to a to half an hour

3058
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:10,480
to a to half an hour
 

3059
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,790
to a to half an hour
that's the expression response but our

3060
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:12,800
that's the expression response but our
 

3061
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,309
that's the expression response but our
daily life doesn't happen on the order

3062
00:52:14,309 --> 00:52:14,319
daily life doesn't happen on the order
 

3063
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:15,190
daily life doesn't happen on the order
of three minutes to

3064
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:15,200
of three minutes to
 

3065
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,630
of three minutes to
half an hour it happens on the order of

3066
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:16,640
half an hour it happens on the order of
 

3067
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,710
half an hour it happens on the order of
milliseconds like i throw a ball at you

3068
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:18,720
milliseconds like i throw a ball at you
 

3069
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,309
milliseconds like i throw a ball at you
you catch it right away

3070
00:52:20,309 --> 00:52:20,319
you catch it right away
 

3071
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:21,990
you catch it right away
no gene expression changes there you

3072
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:22,000
no gene expression changes there you
 

3073
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,750
no gene expression changes there you
just don't have time to do that

3074
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:23,760
just don't have time to do that
 

3075
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,589
just don't have time to do that
so you basically have a layer of control

3076
00:52:27,589 --> 00:52:27,599
so you basically have a layer of control
 

3077
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:30,790
so you basically have a layer of control
built on a hardware that supports it

3078
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:30,800
built on a hardware that supports it
 

3079
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,109
built on a hardware that supports it
but that hardware itself lives in a

3080
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:33,119
but that hardware itself lives in a
 

3081
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:34,870
but that hardware itself lives in a
different time scale

3082
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:34,880
different time scale
 

3083
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,630
different time scale
than the controlling machine on top of

3084
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:36,640
than the controlling machine on top of
 

3085
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,470
than the controlling machine on top of
that is that an accident by the way is

3086
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:38,480
that is that an accident by the way is
 

3087
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,910
that is that an accident by the way is
that like a feature is it

3088
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:39,920
that like a feature is it
 

3089
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,990
that like a feature is it
was it possible for life to have evolved

3090
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:42,000
was it possible for life to have evolved
 

3091
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,030
was it possible for life to have evolved
where

3092
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:43,040
where
 

3093
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,069
where
the our the daily life of the organism

3094
00:52:46,069 --> 00:52:46,079
the our the daily life of the organism
 

3095
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,990
the our the daily life of the organism
as it interacts with its environment

3096
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:48,000
as it interacts with its environment
 

3097
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,030
as it interacts with its environment
was on time scale similar to uh

3098
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:51,040
was on time scale similar to uh
 

3099
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,230
was on time scale similar to uh
the the way our internals work if you

3100
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:54,240
the the way our internals work if you
 

3101
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:54,950
the the way our internals work if you
look at

3102
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:54,960
look at
 

3103
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,349
look at
trees they look kind of boring and

3104
00:52:57,349 --> 00:52:57,359
trees they look kind of boring and
 

3105
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:58,710
trees they look kind of boring and
stupid you're like looking at a tree

3106
00:52:58,710 --> 00:52:58,720
stupid you're like looking at a tree
 

3107
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,190
stupid you're like looking at a tree
like stupid if you speed up the movie of

3108
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:01,200
like stupid if you speed up the movie of
 

3109
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:01,990
like stupid if you speed up the movie of
a tree

3110
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:02,000
a tree
 

3111
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,549
a tree
from spring until october you'll be like

3112
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:04,559
from spring until october you'll be like
 

3113
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,470
from spring until october you'll be like
oh my god it's intelligent

3114
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:06,480
oh my god it's intelligent
 

3115
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,030
oh my god it's intelligent
and the reason for that is that at that

3116
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:09,040
and the reason for that is that at that
 

3117
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:09,910
and the reason for that is that at that
time scale

3118
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:09,920
time scale
 

3119
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,670
time scale
the tree is basically saying oh i'm

looking for a you know a
 

3123
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,190
looking for a you know a
thing to catch on to oh i just caught on

3124
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:15,200
thing to catch on to oh i just caught on
 

3125
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,549
thing to catch on to oh i just caught on
to that i'm going to grow more here i'm

3126
00:53:16,549 --> 00:53:16,559
to that i'm going to grow more here i'm
 

3127
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,069
to that i'm going to grow more here i'm
going to spawn there etc

3128
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:18,079
going to spawn there etc
 

3129
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:20,150
going to spawn there etc
like i can see the trees in my garden

3130
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:20,160
like i can see the trees in my garden
 

3131
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,670
like i can see the trees in my garden
just growing and sort of you know

3132
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:21,680
just growing and sort of you know
 

3133
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,270
just growing and sort of you know
looping around and

3134
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:23,280
looping around and
 

3135
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,190
looping around and
um it's all a matter of time scale

3136
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:27,200
um it's all a matter of time scale
 

3137
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,270
um it's all a matter of time scale
and if you look at the human time scale

3138
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:29,280
and if you look at the human time scale
 

3139
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,950
and if you look at the human time scale
remember we were talking about neoteny

3140
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:30,960
remember we were talking about neoteny

00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,109
that's happening already
is expansion of human lifespan we have

3188
00:54:23,109 --> 00:54:23,119
is expansion of human lifespan we have
 

3189
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,109
is expansion of human lifespan we have
longer and longer periods before we

3190
00:54:25,109 --> 00:54:25,119
longer and longer periods before we
 

3191
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:26,150
longer and longer periods before we
mature

3192
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:26,160
mature
 

3193
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,589
mature
and we have longer and longer periods

3194
00:54:27,589 --> 00:54:27,599
and we have longer and longer periods
 

3195
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,510
and we have longer and longer periods
because before we have babies

3196
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:29,520
because before we have babies
 

3197
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,069
because before we have babies
so intergenerational distance is you

3198
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:32,079
so intergenerational distance is you
 

3199
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,630
so intergenerational distance is you
know grown from i don't know 16 years to

40 years you're saying that's in the
 

3203
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,549
40 years you're saying that's in the
genetics like

no no not necessarily but but it's it's
 

3207
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,270
no no not necessarily but but it's it's
sort of an environmental tendency that's

00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:43,280
sort of an environmental tendency that's
 

3209
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,870
sort of an environmental tendency that's
happening

3210
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:44,880
happening
 

3211
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,150
happening
but as we medically expand

3212
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:48,160
but as we medically expand
 

3213
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,589
but as we medically expand
human lifespan the

3214
00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:51,599
human lifespan the
 

3215
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:54,309
human lifespan the
generations might actually be pushed

3216
00:54:54,309 --> 00:54:54,319
generations might actually be pushed
 

3217
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:55,430
generations might actually be pushed
instead of 40 years

3218
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:55,440
instead of 40 years
 

3219
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,589
instead of 40 years
to 60 years to 100 years if we look at

3220
00:54:57,589 --> 00:54:57,599
to 60 years to 100 years if we look at
 

3221
00:54:57,599 --> 00:54:58,789
to 60 years to 100 years if we look at
the long arc

3222
00:54:58,789 --> 00:54:58,799
the long arc
 

3223
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:02,069
the long arc
of the evolutionary history exactly so

3224
00:55:02,069 --> 00:55:02,079
of the evolutionary history exactly so
 

3225
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:03,829
of the evolutionary history exactly so
as we start thinking about intergalactic

3226
00:55:03,829 --> 00:55:03,839
as we start thinking about intergalactic
 

3227
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:06,710
as we start thinking about intergalactic
travel now

3228
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:06,720
travel now
 

3229
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,430
travel now
i'm sorry that's that's a heck of a

3230
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:09,440
i'm sorry that's that's a heck of a
 

3231
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,630
i'm sorry that's that's a heck of a
transition

3232
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:10,640
transition
 

3233
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,549
transition
uh yeah so let's talk about it no no no

3234
00:55:12,549 --> 00:55:12,559
uh yeah so let's talk about it no no no
 

3235
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:13,910
uh yeah so let's talk about it no no no
no no as as we

3236
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:13,920
no no as as we
 

3237
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,630
no no as as we
as a species start thinking about i mean

3238
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:16,640
as a species start thinking about i mean
 

3239
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,829
as a species start thinking about i mean
i'm talking about these transitions that

3240
00:55:17,829 --> 00:55:17,839
i'm talking about these transitions that
 

3241
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:18,870
i'm talking about these transitions that
are happening right now and that's

3242
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:18,880
are happening right now and that's
 

3243
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:19,589
are happening right now and that's
that's so

3244
00:55:19,589 --> 00:55:19,599
that's so
 

3245
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:20,630
that's so
awesome continuing along these

3246
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:20,640
awesome continuing along these
 

3247
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,549
awesome continuing along these
transitions what does the future hold in

3248
00:55:22,549 --> 00:55:22,559
transitions what does the future hold in
 

3249
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:23,670
transitions what does the future hold in
the next million years

3250
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:23,680
the next million years
 

3251
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,069
the next million years
so the concept of us going to another

3252
00:55:26,069 --> 00:55:26,079
so the concept of us going to another
 

3253
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:26,789
so the concept of us going to another
planet

3254
00:55:26,789 --> 00:55:26,799
planet
 

3255
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:29,589
planet
and that taking three human lifetimes

3256
00:55:29,589 --> 00:55:29,599
and that taking three human lifetimes
 

3257
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:30,789
and that taking three human lifetimes
might be a joke

3258
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:30,799
might be a joke
 

3259
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:32,710
might be a joke
if the human lifetime starts being 400

3260
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:32,720
if the human lifetime starts being 400
 

3261
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,230
if the human lifetime starts being 400
years or

3262
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:34,240
years or
 

3263
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,430
years or
800 years so imagine

3264
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:37,440
800 years so imagine
 

3265
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,349
800 years so imagine
this time scale it's all time scale just

3266
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:39,359
this time scale it's all time scale just
 

3267
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:40,950
this time scale it's all time scale just
different time skills yeah

3268
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:40,960
different time skills yeah
 

3269
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,470
different time skills yeah
you asked me offline whether i would

3270
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:42,480
you asked me offline whether i would
 

3271
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,309
you asked me offline whether i would
like to live forever i mean

3272
00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:44,319
like to live forever i mean
 

3273
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:47,510
like to live forever i mean
my answer is absolutely

3274
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:47,520
my answer is absolutely
 

3275
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,710
my answer is absolutely
and there's many different types of

3276
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:48,720
and there's many different types of
 

3277
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,950
and there's many different types of
forevers one forever

3278
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:50,960
forevers one forever
 

3279
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,470
forevers one forever
is do i want to live today

3280
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:54,480
is do i want to live today
 

3281
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,030
is do i want to live today
forever kind of like groundhog day and

3282
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:57,040
forever kind of like groundhog day and
 

3283
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:57,670
forever kind of like groundhog day and
the answer is

3284
00:55:57,670 --> 00:55:57,680
the answer is
 

3285
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,670
the answer is
absolutely the stuff that i want to

3286
00:55:59,670 --> 00:55:59,680
absolutely the stuff that i want to
 

3287
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,950
absolutely the stuff that i want to
learn today will probably take a

3288
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:00,960
learn today will probably take a
 

3289
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,990
learn today will probably take a
lifetime

3290
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:02,000
lifetime
 

3291
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,309
lifetime
just to learn you know basically to

3292
00:56:04,309 --> 00:56:04,319
just to learn you know basically to
 

3293
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,829
just to learn you know basically to
clear my to-do list for the day

3294
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:05,839
clear my to-do list for the day
 

3295
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:07,990
clear my to-do list for the day
you mean like relive the day of the day

3296
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:08,000
you mean like relive the day of the day
 

3297
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,510
you mean like relive the day of the day
and then and then pick up different

3298
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:09,520
and then and then pick up different
 

3299
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,789
and then and then pick up different
things from the richness of the

3300
00:56:10,789 --> 00:56:10,799
things from the richness of the
 

3301
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:12,710
things from the richness of the
experiences

3302
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:12,720
experiences
 

3303
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,069
experiences
there's just so much happening in the

3304
00:56:14,069 --> 00:56:14,079
there's just so much happening in the
 

3305
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,069
there's just so much happening in the
world every single day so much knowledge

3306
00:56:16,069 --> 00:56:16,079
world every single day so much knowledge
 

3307
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:17,430
world every single day so much knowledge
that has happened already

3308
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:17,440
that has happened already
 

3309
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,030
that has happened already
that just to catch up on that will

3310
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:19,040
that just to catch up on that will
 

3311
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,190
that just to catch up on that will
probably take me around forever

3312
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:21,200
probably take me around forever
 

3313
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,950
probably take me around forever
and that on that point i just i would

3314
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:22,960
and that on that point i just i would
 

3315
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,789
and that on that point i just i would
just love to see you in the groundhog

3316
00:56:24,789 --> 00:56:24,799
just love to see you in the groundhog
 

3317
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:25,589
just love to see you in the groundhog
movie

3318
00:56:25,589 --> 00:56:25,599
movie
 

3319
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,710
movie
just because you're so

3320
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:28,720
just because you're so
 

3321
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,230
just because you're so
naturally as a scientist but just the

3322
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:30,240
naturally as a scientist but just the
 

3323
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,470
naturally as a scientist but just the
way your mind works beautifully

3324

00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:36,480
that you would pick up from that
 

3329
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,230
that you would pick up from that
uh that's a beautiful visual but you

3330
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:38,240
uh that's a beautiful visual but you
 

3331
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,069
uh that's a beautiful visual but you
just try to live each day as if it was

3332
00:56:40,069 --> 00:56:40,079
just try to live each day as if it was
 

3333
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:41,109
just try to live each day as if it was
groundhog

3334
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:41,119
groundhog
 

3335
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:42,950
groundhog
i'm basically every single day waking up

3336
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:42,960
i'm basically every single day waking up
 

3337

on uh
 

3345
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,109
on uh
on a funny tangent like i got a chance

3346
00:56:51,109 --> 00:56:51,119
on a funny tangent like i got a chance
 

3347
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:52,630
on a funny tangent like i got a chance
to uh

3348
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:52,640
to uh
 

3349
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,910
to uh
go to a neural link demonstration event

3350
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:55,920
go to a neural link demonstration event
 

3351
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,150
go to a neural link demonstration event
i'm not usually familiar with neurolink

3352
00:56:58,150 --> 00:56:58,160
i'm not usually familiar with neurolink
 

3353
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,430
i'm not usually familiar with neurolink
and uh i talked to elon for a while uh

3354
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:01,440
and uh i talked to elon for a while uh
 

3355
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,069
and uh i talked to elon for a while uh
and one of the funny things he said on

3356
00:57:04,069 --> 00:57:04,079
and one of the funny things he said on
 

3357
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:05,030
and one of the funny things he said on
this groundhog

3358
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:05,040
this groundhog
 

3359
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,549
this groundhog
day thing is you know it's a beautiful

3360
00:57:08,549 --> 00:57:08,559
day thing is you know it's a beautiful
 

3361
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:09,430
day thing is you know it's a beautiful
dream to

3362
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:09,440
dream to
 

3363
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,190
dream to
eventually be able to replay our

3364
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:11,200
eventually be able to replay our
 

3365
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,549
eventually be able to replay our
memories so we're

3366
00:57:12,549 --> 00:57:12,559
memories so we're
 

3367
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,470
memories so we're
kind of these recording machines our

3368
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:14,480
kind of these recording machines our
 

3369
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,589
kind of these recording machines our
brain is kind of

3370
00:57:15,589 --> 00:57:15,599
brain is kind of
 

3371
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,470
brain is kind of
uh maybe a noisy recording machine of

3372
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:18,480
uh maybe a noisy recording machine of
 

3373
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,750
uh maybe a noisy recording machine of
memories

3374
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:19,760
memories
 

3375
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,870
memories
and it would be beautiful if we can

3376
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:22,880
and it would be beautiful if we can
 

3377
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,270
and it would be beautiful if we can
someday in the future maybe far into the

3378
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:25,280
someday in the future maybe far into the
 

3379
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,069
someday in the future maybe far into the
future

3380
00:57:26,069 --> 00:57:26,079
future
 

3381
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:28,069
future
be able to like in the groundhog day

3382
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:28,079
be able to like in the groundhog day
 

3383
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:29,670
be able to like in the groundhog day
situation replay that

3384
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:29,680
situation replay that
 

3385
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,309
situation replay that
and the funny comment that stuck with me

3386
00:57:32,309 --> 00:57:32,319
and the funny comment that stuck with me
 

3387
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:33,589
and the funny comment that stuck with me
is he said that

3388
00:57:33,589 --> 00:57:33,599
is he said that
 

3389
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:36,549
is he said that
maybe this our conversation now is a

3390
00:57:36,549 --> 00:57:36,559
maybe this our conversation now is a
 

3391
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:37,589
maybe this our conversation now is a
replay

3392
00:57:37,589 --> 00:57:37,599
replay
 

3393
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:39,990
replay
of a member of a previous memory and

3394
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:40,000
of a member of a previous memory and
 

3395
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,309
of a member of a previous memory and
that stuck with me because

3396
00:57:42,309 --> 00:57:42,319
that stuck with me because
 

3397
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:44,470
that stuck with me because
it would probably be my replay you know

3398
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:44,480
it would probably be my replay you know
 

3399
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,910
it would probably be my replay you know
who the hell am i i'm just some

3400
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:45,920
who the hell am i i'm just some
 

3401
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:50,069
who the hell am i i'm just some
idiot guy but like elon musk is you know

3402
00:57:50,069 --> 00:57:50,079
idiot guy but like elon musk is you know
 

3403
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,230
idiot guy but like elon musk is you know
probably because of spacex and so on is

3404
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:52,240
probably because of spacex and so on is
 

3405
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,750
probably because of spacex and so on is
probably going to be remembered as a

3406
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:53,760
probably going to be remembered as a
 

3407
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:54,950
probably going to be remembered as a
special person

3408
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:54,960
special person
 

3409
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,990
special person
one of our special apes in history

3410
00:57:57,990 --> 00:57:58,000
one of our special apes in history
 

3411
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,549
one of our special apes in history
so if i wanted to replay memory probably

3412
00:58:00,549 --> 00:58:00,559
so if i wanted to replay memory probably
 

3413
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,309
so if i wanted to replay memory probably
be that one you know talking to elon for

3414
00:58:02,309 --> 00:58:02,319
be that one you know talking to elon for
 

3415
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:03,510
be that one you know talking to elon for
a while yeah

3416
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:03,520
a while yeah
 

3417
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,789
a while yeah
that's an interesting uh possibility

3418
00:58:06,789 --> 00:58:06,799
that's an interesting uh possibility
 

3419
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:08,230
that's an interesting uh possibility
from uh

3420
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:08,240
from uh
 

3421
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,230
from uh
if we think about time scales if we

3422
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:10,240
if we think about time scales if we
 

3423
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,750
if we think about time scales if we
think about

3424
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:11,760
think about
 

3425
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,390
think about
the richness of the experience through

3426
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:14,400
the richness of the experience through
 

3427
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,430
the richness of the experience through
time

3428
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:15,440
time
 

3429
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,710
time
that we humans take and be able to

3430
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:18,720
that we humans take and be able to
 

3431
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,950
that we humans take and be able to
replace some aspects of that of that

3432
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:20,960
replace some aspects of that of that
 

3433
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,230
replace some aspects of that of that
biology that's

3434
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:22,240
biology that's
 

3435
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,549
biology that's
super interesting but anyway sorry sorry

3436
00:58:24,549 --> 00:58:24,559
super interesting but anyway sorry sorry
 

3437
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:25,990
super interesting but anyway sorry sorry
for the tangent let's

3438
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:26,000
for the tangent let's
 

3439
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,589
for the tangent let's
yeah you were talking about time scales

3440
00:58:27,589 --> 00:58:27,599
yeah you were talking about time scales
 

3441
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,309
yeah you were talking about time scales
and the expansion of the

3442
00:58:30,309 --> 00:58:30,319
and the expansion of the
 

3443
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:33,510
and the expansion of the
human lifetime and uh

3444
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:33,520
human lifetime and uh
 

3445
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,710
human lifetime and uh
the intergalactic travel yeah no but but

3446
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:36,720
the intergalactic travel yeah no but but
 

3447
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:37,910
the intergalactic travel yeah no but but
you're laughing about this

3448
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:37,920
you're laughing about this
 

3449
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,589
you're laughing about this
yeah for sure that is you're talking

3450
00:58:39,589 --> 00:58:39,599
yeah for sure that is you're talking
 

3451
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:40,630
yeah for sure that is you're talking
about this you're talking about

3452
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:40,640
about this you're talking about
 

3453
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,630
about this you're talking about
exploring alien worlds yeah and going to

3454
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:42,640
exploring alien worlds yeah and going to
 

3455
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:43,829
exploring alien worlds yeah and going to
other planets i mean

3456
00:58:43,829 --> 00:58:43,839
other planets i mean
 

3457
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:45,270
other planets i mean
you know when sarah was here she was

3458
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:45,280
you know when sarah was here she was
 

3459
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,470
you know when sarah was here she was
talking about sort of going to other

3460
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:46,480
talking about sort of going to other
 

3461
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,109
talking about sort of going to other
planets

3462
00:58:47,109 --> 00:58:47,119
planets
 

3463
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:49,910
planets
when we find these life i mean i'm just

3464
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:49,920
when we find these life i mean i'm just
 

3465
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,750
when we find these life i mean i'm just
very naturally

3466
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:51,760
very naturally
 

3467
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,589
very naturally
given the topics that we've approached

3468
00:58:53,589 --> 00:58:53,599
given the topics that we've approached
 

3469
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:55,349
given the topics that we've approached
talking about the the time scale at

3470
00:58:55,349 --> 00:58:55,359
talking about the the time scale at
 

3471
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,470
talking about the the time scale at
which this will happen

3472
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:56,480
which this will happen
 

3473
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,270
which this will happen
so i think eventually we will human or

3474
00:58:59,270 --> 00:58:59,280
so i think eventually we will human or
 

3475
00:58:59,280 --> 00:58:59,990
so i think eventually we will human or
life

3476
00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:00,000
life
 

3477
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,430
life
life will expand out into the universe

3478
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:03,440
life will expand out into the universe
 

3479
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,190
life will expand out into the universe
the the point that i'm trying to make is

3480
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:05,200
the the point that i'm trying to make is
 

3481
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,829
the the point that i'm trying to make is
that in intergalactic species

3482
00:59:07,829 --> 00:59:07,839
that in intergalactic species
 

3483
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:10,390
that in intergalactic species
we'll probably find ways to engineer its

3484
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:10,400
we'll probably find ways to engineer its
 

3485
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,670
we'll probably find ways to engineer its
biology

3486
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:11,680
biology
 

3487
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,030
biology
in order to expand the way that we

3488
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:15,040
in order to expand the way that we
 

3489
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:15,910
in order to expand the way that we
experience

3490
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:15,920
experience
 

3491
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,710
experience
time expand the the time skills that we

3492
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:18,720
time expand the the time skills that we
 

3493
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,349
time expand the the time skills that we
experienced

3494
00:59:19,349 --> 00:59:19,359
experienced
 

3495
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,670
experienced
and going back to this whole concept of

3496
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:21,680
and going back to this whole concept of
 

3497
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,829
and going back to this whole concept of
you know would i like to live forever

3498
00:59:23,829 --> 00:59:23,839
you know would i like to live forever
 

3499
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:25,750
you know would i like to live forever
yes i'd like to live forever even if it

3500
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:25,760
yes i'd like to live forever even if it
 

3501
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,670
yes i'd like to live forever even if it
was even if i was stuck on the same day

3502
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:27,680
was even if i was stuck on the same day
 

3503
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,430
was even if i was stuck on the same day
i'd love to live forever because i would

3504
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:29,440
i'd love to live forever because i would
 

3505
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,870
i'd love to live forever because i would
finally have time to do all these things

3506
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:30,880
finally have time to do all these things
 

3507
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,309
finally have time to do all these things
that i want to do

3508
00:59:32,309 --> 00:59:32,319
that i want to do
 

3509
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:34,710
that i want to do
but if living forever actually comes

3510
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:34,720
but if living forever actually comes
 

3511
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:35,670
but if living forever actually comes
with a perk

3512
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:35,680
with a perk
 

3513
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,910
with a perk
of watching the whole world evolve

3514
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:37,920
of watching the whole world evolve
 

3515
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,349
of watching the whole world evolve
forever i mean

3516
00:59:39,349 --> 00:59:39,359
forever i mean
 

3517
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:41,829
forever i mean
that's a huge perk and i would you know

3518
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:41,839
that's a huge perk and i would you know
 

3519
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:43,510
that's a huge perk and i would you know
just it'll never get boring

3520
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:43,520
just it'll never get boring
 

3521
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,829
just it'll never get boring
just an ever-changing world and then the

3522
00:59:45,829 --> 00:59:45,839
just an ever-changing world and then the
 

3523
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:47,270
just an ever-changing world and then the
mind uh

3524
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:47,280
mind uh
 

3525
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,670
mind uh
you know sort of experiment that i want

3526
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:49,680
you know sort of experiment that i want
 

3527
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,789
you know sort of experiment that i want
you to to do

3528
00:59:50,789 --> 00:59:50,799
you to to do
 

3529
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:53,190
you to to do
is to also ask what if i wanted to live

3530
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:53,200
is to also ask what if i wanted to live
 

3531
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,390
is to also ask what if i wanted to live
forever

3532
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:54,400
forever
 

3533
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,430
forever
one day at a time every year

3534
00:59:57,430 --> 00:59:57,440
one day at a time every year
 

3535
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,910
one day at a time every year
or one day at a time every decade would

3536
00:59:59,910 --> 00:59:59,920
or one day at a time every decade would
 

3537
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,190
or one day at a time every decade would
you choose that

3538
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:01,200
you choose that
 

3539
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,950
you choose that
where you would wake up and the world

3540
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:02,960
where you would wake up and the world
 

3541
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,230
where you would wake up and the world
would be 10 years later

3542
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:04,240
would be 10 years later
 

3543
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,069
would be 10 years later
every single day you wake up it's the

3544
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:06,079
every single day you wake up it's the
 

3545
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:07,750
every single day you wake up it's the
opposite of groundhog day

3546
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:07,760
opposite of groundhog day
 

3547
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,510
opposite of groundhog day
where basically you always wake up and

3548
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:09,520
where basically you always wake up and
 

3549
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,190
where basically you always wake up and
it's always 10 years later

3550
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:11,200
it's always 10 years later
 

3551
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,789
it's always 10 years later
so you're saying that's such a powerful

3552
01:00:14,789 --> 01:00:14,799
so you're saying that's such a powerful
 

3553
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:17,829
so you're saying that's such a powerful
interesting concept that life is

3554
01:00:17,829 --> 01:00:17,839
interesting concept that life is
 

3555
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:21,270
interesting concept that life is
more interesting if you're of all the

3556
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:21,280
more interesting if you're of all the
 

3557
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,549
more interesting if you're of all the
life forms on earth

3558
01:00:22,549 --> 01:00:22,559
life forms on earth
 

3559
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:25,030
life forms on earth
that you're the slowest one exactly

3560
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:25,040
that you're the slowest one exactly
 

3561
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,870
that you're the slowest one exactly
exactly like trees

3562
01:00:28,870 --> 01:00:28,880
exactly like trees
 

3563
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,230
exactly like trees
like you know they've been there since

3564
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:30,240
like you know they've been there since
 

3565
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,470
like you know they've been there since
the minoan civilization yeah and you

3566
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:32,480
the minoan civilization yeah and you
 

3567
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,670
the minoan civilization yeah and you
know that takes us back to the the

3568
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:33,680
know that takes us back to the the
 

3569
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,270
know that takes us back to the the
question you asked about sort of

3570
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:35,280
question you asked about sort of
 

3571
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,630
question you asked about sort of
the transformations that have happened

3572
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:36,640
the transformations that have happened
 

3573
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,950
the transformations that have happened
in humanity the minoan civilization is

3574
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:38,960
in humanity the minoan civilization is
 

3575
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,390
in humanity the minoan civilization is
one of them

3576
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:40,400
one of them
 

3577
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,510
one of them
you know there's this paper that was

3578
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:41,520
you know there's this paper that was
 

3579
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:42,789
you know there's this paper that was
published just a couple of years ago by

3580
01:00:42,789 --> 01:00:42,799
published just a couple of years ago by
 

3581
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:44,230
published just a couple of years ago by
one of my friends

3582
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:44,240
one of my friends
 

3583
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,430
one of my friends
that basically looked at the

3584
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:47,440
that basically looked at the
 

3585
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:51,510
that basically looked at the
uh genetic makeup of the minoans

3586
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:51,520
uh genetic makeup of the minoans
 

3587
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,910
uh genetic makeup of the minoans
and the messinians in ancient greek in

3588
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:53,920
and the messinians in ancient greek in
 

3589
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,750
and the messinians in ancient greek in
ancient greece and how they relate to

3590
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:55,760
ancient greece and how they relate to
 

3591
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:56,870
ancient greece and how they relate to
modern greeks

3592
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:56,880
modern greeks
 

3593
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,150
modern greeks
and they found that indeed there was

3594
01:00:58,150 --> 01:00:58,160
and they found that indeed there was
 

3595
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,549
and they found that indeed there was
very little gene flow

3596
01:01:00,549 --> 01:01:00,559
very little gene flow
 

3597
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:03,589
very little gene flow
from you know the outside and

3598
01:01:03,589 --> 01:01:03,599
from you know the outside and
 

3599
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:06,789
from you know the outside and
you know it's it's fantastic to sort of

3600
01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:06,799
you know it's it's fantastic to sort of
 

3601
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:09,589
you know it's it's fantastic to sort of
think about these amazing civilizations

3602
01:01:09,589 --> 01:01:09,599
think about these amazing civilizations
 

3603
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,589
think about these amazing civilizations
that transformed the way that human

3604
01:01:11,589 --> 01:01:11,599

the standards of beauty not human beauty

3614
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:23,280
the standards of beauty not human beauty
 

3615
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,430
the standards of beauty not human beauty
but beauty in the natural world

3616
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:25,440
but beauty in the natural world
 

3617
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,670
but beauty in the natural world
this whole concept that the world must

3618
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:27,680
this whole concept that the world must
 

3619
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:28,630
this whole concept that the world must
be elegant

3620
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:28,640
be elegant
 

3621
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,390
be elegant
and there must be deeper ways of

01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:30,400
and there must be deeper ways of
 

3623
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,829
and there must be deeper ways of

understanding that world
 

3625
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:34,789
understanding that world
to me that's a massive transformation of

01:01:34,789 --> 01:01:34,799
to me that's a massive transformation of
 

3627
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:36,950
to me that's a massive transformation of
our species

you know we're talking about these worms
crawling around and then sensing which

crawling around and then sensing which
 

3647
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:54,950

01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,710
i mean when i say nose i mean
ways of sensing chemicals that's

3658
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:04,720
ways of sensing chemicals that's
 

3659
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,630
ways of sensing chemicals that's
probably one of the earliest senses

3660
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:06,640
probably one of the earliest senses
 

3661
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:07,910
probably one of the earliest senses
you know we always talk about how deep

3662
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:07,920
you know we always talk about how deep
 

3663
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,829

the earliest senses
 

3667
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,549
the earliest senses
if you look at hearing that's a much

3668
01:02:12,549 --> 01:02:12,559
if you look at hearing that's a much
 

3669
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:14,470
if you look at hearing that's a much
later sense if you look at eyesight

3670
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:14,480
later sense if you look at eyesight
 

3671
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,910
later sense if you look at eyesight
that's an intermediate sense where

3672
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:15,920
that's an intermediate sense where
 

3673
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,750
that's an intermediate sense where
you're basically sensing where the light

3674
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:17,760
you're basically sensing where the light
 

3675
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:18,870
you're basically sensing where the light
direction comes from

3676
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:18,880
direction comes from
 

3677
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,069
direction comes from
that's probably something that life

3678
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:20,079
that's probably something that life
 

3679
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:22,069
that's probably something that life
didn't mean until it got you know into

3680
01:02:22,069 --> 01:02:22,079
didn't mean until it got you know into
 

3681
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:22,950
didn't mean until it got you know into
the surface

3682
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:22,960
the surface
 

3683
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,109
the surface
and so on and so forth so there's a lot

3684
01:02:25,109 --> 01:02:25,119
and so on and so forth so there's a lot
 

3685
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:26,710
and so on and so forth so there's a lot
of

3686
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:26,720
of
 

3687
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,870
of
you know milestones and i was talking

3688
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:28,880
you know milestones and i was talking
 

3689
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,190
you know milestones and i was talking
about the latest milestone which is ligo

3690
01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:31,200
about the latest milestone which is ligo
 

3691
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,789
about the latest milestone which is ligo
last time of being able to detect

3692
01:02:32,789 --> 01:02:32,799
last time of being able to detect
 

3693
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:34,390
last time of being able to detect
gravitational waves

3694
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:34,400
gravitational waves
 

3695
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,029
gravitational waves
and sort of being able to sort of have a

3696
01:02:37,029 --> 01:02:37,039
and sort of being able to sort of have a
 

3697
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:38,549
and sort of being able to sort of have a
sense that humans haven't had

3698
01:02:38,549 --> 01:02:38,559
sense that humans haven't had
 

3699
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:41,029
sense that humans haven't had
before so you see that as a yet another

3700
01:02:41,029 --> 01:02:41,039
before so you see that as a yet another
 

3701
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:41,829
before so you see that as a yet another
transformation

3702
01:02:41,829 --> 01:02:41,839
transformation
 

3703
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:43,510
transformation
it gives us an extra little sound of

3704
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:43,520
it gives us an extra little sound of
 

3705
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,349
it gives us an extra little sound of
course and now if you go back to this

3706
01:02:45,349 --> 01:02:45,359
course and now if you go back to this
 

3707
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:46,950
course and now if you go back to this
history of ancient greece

3708
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:46,960
history of ancient greece
 

3709
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,950
history of ancient greece
i mean this this transformation that

3710
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:48,960
i mean this this transformation that
 

3711
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,390
i mean this this transformation that
happened i mean of course

3712
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:50,400
happened i mean of course
 

3713
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,789
happened i mean of course
the egyptians had this incredible you

3714
01:02:52,789 --> 01:02:52,799
the egyptians had this incredible you
 

3715
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:55,430
the egyptians had this incredible you
know civilization for thousands of years

3716
01:02:55,430 --> 01:02:55,440
know civilization for thousands of years
 

3717
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,109
know civilization for thousands of years
but what happened in greece was this

3718
01:02:57,109 --> 01:02:57,119
but what happened in greece was this
 

3719
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:59,349
but what happened in greece was this

physics let's basically build rules

3726
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:04,400
physics let's basically build rules
 

3727
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,069

you asked me in passing

3736
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:14,960
you asked me in passing
 

3737
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,430
you asked me in passing
was this whole concept of embracing the

3738
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:17,440
was this whole concept of embracing the
 

3739
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,390
was this whole concept of embracing the
good and the bad

3740

good and the bad
 

3741
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,230
good and the bad
embracing your the full range of human

3742
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:20,240
embracing your the full range of human

3745
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,470
emotions
and if you look at greek tragedy it's

3746
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:24,480
and if you look at greek tragedy it's
 

3747
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,390
and if you look at greek tragedy it's
the definition of that

3748
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:26,400
the definition of that
 

3749
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,190
the definition of that
it's i mean drama i mean again it's a

3750
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:29,200
it's i mean drama i mean again it's a

greek word
 

3753
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:33,910
greek word
but but the whole concept of some

3754
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:33,920
but but the whole concept of some
 

3755
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,670
but but the whole concept of some
problems that are just so vast and large

3756
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:37,680
problems that are just so vast and large
 

3757
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:41,910
problems that are just so vast and large
that dying is the easy way out

3758
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:41,920
that dying is the easy way out
 

3759
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,390
that dying is the easy way out
the death oh that's the easy solution

3760
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:44,400
the death oh that's the easy solution
 

3761
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,589
the death oh that's the easy solution
you know so so

3762
01:03:45,589 --> 01:03:45,599
you know so so
 

3763
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:46,789
you know so so
i want to touch a little bit on that

3764
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:46,799
i want to touch a little bit on that
 

3765
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:48,950
i want to touch a little bit on that
point and and um

3766
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:48,960
point and and um
 

3767
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,630
point and and um
sort of talk about this concept

3768
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:52,640
sort of talk about this concept
 

3769
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:56,710
sort of talk about this concept
that life supersedes physics

3770
01:03:56,710 --> 01:03:56,720
that life supersedes physics
 

3771
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:01,510
that life supersedes physics
and that the brain supersedes life

3772
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:01,520
and that the brain supersedes life
 

3773
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,910
and that the brain supersedes life
that basically we have a brain that can

3774
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:03,920
that basically we have a brain that can
 

3775
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,109
that basically we have a brain that can
decide

3776
01:04:05,109 --> 01:04:05,119
decide
 

3777
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,589
decide
to not follow evolution's path we can

3778
01:04:07,589 --> 01:04:07,599
to not follow evolution's path we can
 

3779
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:09,750
to not follow evolution's path we can
decide to not have children

3780
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:09,760
decide to not have children
 

3781
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,630
decide to not have children
we can decide to not eat we can decide

3782
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:12,640
we can decide to not eat we can decide
 

3783
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,309
we can decide to not eat we can decide
to suicide

3784
01:04:14,309 --> 01:04:14,319
to suicide
 

3785
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:16,950
to suicide
we can decide to sort of abolish

3786
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:16,960
we can decide to sort of abolish
 

3787
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,950
we can decide to sort of abolish
communication with the outside world

3788
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:18,960
communication with the outside world
 

3789
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,670
communication with the outside world
i mean all the things that make us human

3790
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:21,680
i mean all the things that make us human
 

3791
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,190
i mean all the things that make us human
we can basically decide

3792
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:23,200
we can basically decide
 

3793
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,910
we can basically decide
not to do that and that that is

3794
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:25,920
not to do that and that that is
 

3795
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,349
not to do that and that that is
basically when

3796
01:04:27,349 --> 01:04:27,359
basically when
 

3797
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:29,710
basically when
the brain itself is basically

3798
01:04:29,710 --> 01:04:29,720
the brain itself is basically
 

3799
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:31,109
the brain itself is basically
superseding

3800
01:04:31,109 --> 01:04:31,119
superseding
 

3801
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:35,589
superseding
what evolution program is for so

3802
01:04:35,589 --> 01:04:35,599
what evolution program is for so
 

3803
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:38,950
what evolution program is for so
okay so one of the it's okay my mind was

3804
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:38,960
okay so one of the it's okay my mind was
 

3805
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:39,750
okay so one of the it's okay my mind was
already blown

3806
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:39,760
already blown
 

3807
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,549
already blown
at the beautiful formulation of the idea

3808
01:04:42,549 --> 01:04:42,559
at the beautiful formulation of the idea
 

3809
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:43,670
at the beautiful formulation of the idea
that

3810
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:43,680
that
 

3811
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:47,750
that
life is uh is a system that

3812
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:47,760
life is uh is a system that
 

3813
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,789
life is uh is a system that
resists physics yeah and

3814
01:04:50,789 --> 01:04:50,799
resists physics yeah and
 

3815
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:53,349
resists physics yeah and
our brain or perhaps the content of it

3816
01:04:53,349 --> 01:04:53,359
our brain or perhaps the content of it
 

3817
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:54,309
our brain or perhaps the content of it
or

3818
01:04:54,309 --> 01:04:54,319
or
 

3819
01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:57,430
or
however maybe functionally our brain

3820
01:04:57,430 --> 01:04:57,440
however maybe functionally our brain
 

3821
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,630
however maybe functionally our brain
is a thing that resists life yes

3822
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:00,640
is a thing that resists life yes
 

3823
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:05,109
is a thing that resists life yes
yes you're so

3824
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:05,119
yes you're so
 

3825
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:08,150
yes you're so
you're so brilliant but but

3826
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:08,160
you're so brilliant but but
 

3827
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,390
you're so brilliant but but
but but i want you to see all of that as

3828
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:10,400
but but i want you to see all of that as
 

3829
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,349
but but i want you to see all of that as
a continuum

3830
01:05:11,349 --> 01:05:11,359
a continuum
 

3831
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:12,549
a continuum
basically you're sort of talking about

3832
01:05:12,549 --> 01:05:12,559
basically you're sort of talking about
 

3833
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:14,470
basically you're sort of talking about
the sort of individual transformations

3834
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:14,480
the sort of individual transformations
 

3835
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,349
the sort of individual transformations
but it's a path yeah that that humanity

3836
01:05:17,349 --> 01:05:17,359
but it's a path yeah that that humanity
 

3837
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:18,390
but it's a path yeah that that humanity
has a transformation

3838
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:18,400
has a transformation
 

3839
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,190
has a transformation
it's a path of transformation and then i

3840
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:21,200
it's a path of transformation and then i
 

3841
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:21,990
it's a path of transformation and then i
want us to think

3842
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:22,000
want us to think
 

3843
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,230
want us to think
about what it truly means to become

3844
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:24,240
about what it truly means to become
 

3845
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,510
about what it truly means to become
human like the

3846
01:05:25,510 --> 01:05:25,520
human like the
 

3847
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:28,150
human like the
f zine and you asked me about what

3848
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:28,160
f zine and you asked me about what
 

3849
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,630
f zine and you asked me about what
motivated my meaning of life symposium

3850
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:30,640
motivated my meaning of life symposium
 

3851
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:33,510
motivated my meaning of life symposium
what motivated it in part i mean of

3852
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:33,520
what motivated it in part i mean of
 

3853
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,029
what motivated it in part i mean of
course it was an inside joke of turning

3854
01:05:35,029 --> 01:05:35,039
course it was an inside joke of turning
 

3855
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:36,789
course it was an inside joke of turning
42

3856
01:05:36,789 --> 01:05:36,799
42
 

3857
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:39,510
42
but what motivated him in part was

3858
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:39,520
but what motivated him in part was
 

3859
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,670
but what motivated him in part was
actually a mid-life crisis

3860
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:41,680
actually a mid-life crisis
 

3861
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,309
actually a mid-life crisis
so the joke that i always like to say is

3862
01:05:44,309 --> 01:05:44,319
so the joke that i always like to say is
 

3863

and then when you're a full professor
 

3899
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:19,109
and then when you're a full professor
well by then you're basically a rat

3900
01:06:19,109 --> 01:06:19,119
well by then you're basically a rat

01:06:24,789 --> 01:06:24,799
i arrived at the end of the rat race
 

3907
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:26,069
i arrived at the end of the rat race
yeah you know

3908
01:06:26,069 --> 01:06:26,079
yeah you know
 

3909
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:27,829
yeah you know
life is a rat race you constantly have

3910
01:06:27,829 --> 01:06:27,839
life is a rat race you constantly have
 

3911
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:29,589
life is a rat race you constantly have
hurdles to jump over you constantly have

3912
01:06:29,589 --> 01:06:29,599
hurdles to jump over you constantly have
 

3913
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:31,510
hurdles to jump over you constantly have
tunnels and secret pathways

3914
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:31,520
tunnels and secret pathways
 

3915
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,670
tunnels and secret pathways
and i figured it all out and eventually

3916
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:33,680
and i figured it all out and eventually
 

3917
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,270
and i figured it all out and eventually
as i was turning 42

3918
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:35,280
as i was turning 42
 

3919
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:37,990
as i was turning 42
i looked back and i was like wow that

3920
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:38,000
i looked back and i was like wow that
 

3921
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,309
i looked back and i was like wow that
was an awesome rat race

3922
01:06:40,309 --> 01:06:40,319
was an awesome rat race
 

3923
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:43,829
was an awesome rat race
but i'm not a rat i basically got out of

3924
01:06:43,829 --> 01:06:43,839
but i'm not a rat i basically got out of
 

3925
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:45,349
but i'm not a rat i basically got out of
the labyrinth and i was like

3926
01:06:45,349 --> 01:06:45,359
the labyrinth and i was like
 

3927
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:47,829
the labyrinth and i was like
i'm not i'm not a rat turns out is that

3928
01:06:47,829 --> 01:06:47,839
i'm not i'm not a rat turns out is that

undergraduate because you have problem

3940
01:06:59,190 --> 01:06:59,200
undergraduate because you have problem
 

3941
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,549
undergraduate because you have problem
sets and

3942
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:00,559
sets and
 

3943
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:02,630

you know we're all smart people you know
 

3945
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,309
you know we're all smart people you know
problem set it has a solution somebody

3946
01:07:04,309 --> 01:07:04,319
problem set it has a solution somebody
 

3947
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:06,470
problem set it has a solution somebody
made it for you you can just solve it

3948
01:07:06,470 --> 01:07:06,480
made it for you you can just solve it
 

3949
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:09,190
made it for you you can just solve it
everything was made as a test and you

3950
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:09,200
everything was made as a test and you
 

3951
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,549
everything was made as a test and you
keep passing those tests and tests and

3952
01:07:10,549 --> 01:07:10,559
keep passing those tests and tests and
 

3953

tests and tests
 

3955
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:14,309
tests and tests
and you have tasks that are well defined

3956
01:07:14,309 --> 01:07:14,319
and you have tasks that are well defined
 

3957
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:16,470
and you have tasks that are well defined
the phd is a little different

3958
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:16,480
the phd is a little different
 

3959
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,309
the phd is a little different
because it's more open-ended but yet you

3960
01:07:18,309 --> 01:07:18,319
because it's more open-ended but yet you
 

3961

tenure
is a well-set defined set of tasks and

3968
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:26,480
is a well-set defined set of tasks and
 

3969
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:27,990
is a well-set defined set of tasks and
you do all that

3970
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:28,000
you do all that
 

3971
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,430

01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:53,440
but basically that was my realization
 

3995
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,510
but basically that was my realization
that it's not a rat race

i have to basically think how do i fully

4000
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:02,960
i have to basically think how do i fully
 

4001
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,630
i have to basically think how do i fully
instantiate myself how do i

4002
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:04,640
instantiate myself how do i
 

4003

instantiate myself how do i
complete my transformation into an

4004
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:06,400
complete my transformation into an
 

4005
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,309
complete my transformation into an
actual human being

4006
01:08:08,309 --> 01:08:08,319
actual human being
 

4007
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,710
actual human being
because it's very easy to sort of forget

4008
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:10,720
because it's very easy to sort of forget
 

4009

it's very hard to just sort of think

4012
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:14,720
it's very hard to just sort of think
 

4013
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,229
it's very hard to just sort of think
about the next task and the next ask and

4014
01:08:16,229 --> 01:08:16,239
about the next task and the next ask and
 

4015
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:17,669
about the next task and the next ask and
it's all metrics and you know what's the

4016
01:08:17,669 --> 01:08:17,679
it's all metrics and you know what's the
 

4017
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:18,870
it's all metrics and you know what's the
number of viewers i have what is the

4018
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:18,880
number of viewers i have what is the
 

4019
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,309
number of viewers i have what is the
number of you know publications i have

4020
01:08:20,309 --> 01:08:20,319
number of you know publications i have
 

4021
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:21,510
number of you know publications i have
what's the number of citations

4022
01:08:21,510 --> 01:08:21,520
what's the number of citations
 

4023
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,110
what's the number of citations
the number of talks the number of grants

4024
01:08:23,110 --> 01:08:23,120
the number of talks the number of grants
 

4025
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,189
the number of talks the number of grants
it's very easy to quantify everything

4026
01:08:25,189 --> 01:08:25,199
it's very easy to quantify everything
 

4027
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:27,349
it's very easy to quantify everything
and then at some point you're like this

4028
01:08:27,349 --> 01:08:27,359
and then at some point you're like this
 

4029
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:28,709
and then at some point you're like this
is real life

4030
01:08:28,709 --> 01:08:28,719
is real life
 

4031
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:30,470
is real life
it's not a test anymore and that's

4032
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:30,480
it's not a test anymore and that's
 

4033
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:31,749
it's not a test anymore and that's
something that i told my wife

4034
01:08:31,749 --> 01:08:31,759
something that i told my wife
 

4035
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:35,269
something that i told my wife
early on i was like no no

4036
01:08:35,269 --> 01:08:35,279
early on i was like no no
 

4037
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:36,550
early on i was like no no
our life is not going to be let's put

4038
01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:36,560
our life is not going to be let's put
 

4039
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,309

the kids through college

4040
01:08:38,309 --> 01:08:38,319
the kids through college
 

4041
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:39,669
the kids through college
and that you know maybe that's when i

4042
01:08:39,669 --> 01:08:39,679
and that you know maybe that's when i
 

4043
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:41,510
and that you know maybe that's when i
escaped the rat race maybe it continued

4044
01:08:41,510 --> 01:08:41,520
escaped the rat race maybe it continued
 

4045
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:42,870
escaped the rat race maybe it continued
being a rat race maybe the next step

4046
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:42,880
being a rat race maybe the next step
 

4047
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:43,590
being a rat race maybe the next step
would have been

4048
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:43,600
would have been
 

4049
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,030
would have been
all right how do i make sure that my kid

4050

greatest callers and then you know
 

4057
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,349
greatest callers and then you know
they're into college

4058
01:08:51,349 --> 01:08:51,359
they're into college
 

4059
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:55,590
they're into college
and then you're like 60.

with their

5540
01:34:47,590 --> 01:34:47,600
with their
 

5541
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:50,390
with their
unbelievable abilities being able to do

5542
01:34:50,390 --> 01:34:50,400
unbelievable abilities being able to do
 

5543
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:52,629
unbelievable abilities being able to do
things that i'm no longer able to do

5544
01:34:52,629 --> 01:34:52,639
things that i'm no longer able to do
 

5545
01:34:52,639 --> 01:34:54,390
things that i'm no longer able to do
better than i probably was ever able to

5546
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:54,400
better than i probably was ever able to
 

5547
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:56,149
better than i probably was ever able to
do but yet

5548
01:34:56,149 --> 01:34:56,159
do but yet

new directions
 

5557
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:07,189
new directions
through my perspective and i know when

01:35:07,189 --> 01:35:07,199
through my perspective and i know when
 

5559
01:35:07,199 --> 01:35:08,709
through my perspective and i know when
something is solvable because i've been

5560
01:35:08,709 --> 01:35:08,719
something is solvable because i've been
 

5561
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:09,270
something is solvable because i've been
there

there
 

5563
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:11,109
there
but i'm not going to even bother it's

5564
01:35:11,109 --> 01:35:11,119
but i'm not going to even bother it's
 

5565
01:35:11,119 --> 01:35:12,310
but i'm not going to even bother it's
not that i can't do it

5566
01:35:12,310 --> 01:35:12,320
not that i can't do it
 

5567
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,390
not that i can't do it
i'm sure i could if i tried i just i'm

i'm sure i could if i tried i just i'm
 

5569

i was like no little thing you didn't

5632
01:36:20,310 --> 01:36:20,320
i was like no little thing you didn't
 

5633
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:21,830
i was like no little thing you didn't
figure out anything

5634
01:36:21,830 --> 01:36:21,840
figure out anything
 

5635
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:23,910
figure out anything
i mean ultimately it seems that if

5636
01:36:23,910 --> 01:36:23,920
i mean ultimately it seems that if
 

5637
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:26,470
i mean ultimately it seems that if
you're introspective about life it all

5638
01:36:26,470 --> 01:36:26,480
you're introspective about life it all
 

5639
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:29,510
you're introspective about life it all
it leads to a kind of acceptance

5640
01:36:29,510 --> 01:36:29,520
it leads to a kind of acceptance
 

5641
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:32,629
it leads to a kind of acceptance
a deeper and deeper acceptance of the

5642
01:36:32,629 --> 01:36:32,639
a deeper and deeper acceptance of the
 

5643
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:33,830
a deeper and deeper acceptance of the
whole of it

5644
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:33,840
whole of it
 

5645
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,590
whole of it
there again i want to be cautious about

5646
01:36:35,590 --> 01:36:35,600
there again i want to be cautious about
 

5647
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,510
there again i want to be cautious about
acceptance because it almost says that

5648
01:36:37,510 --> 01:36:37,520
acceptance because it almost says that
 

5649
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:38,790
acceptance because it almost says that
you can't change it

5650
01:36:38,790 --> 01:36:38,800
you can't change it
 

5651
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:41,910
you can't change it
ah yeah it's it's sort of embracing the

5652
01:36:41,910 --> 01:36:41,920
ah yeah it's it's sort of embracing the
 

5653
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:42,470
ah yeah it's it's sort of embracing the
struggle

5654
01:36:42,470 --> 01:36:42,480
struggle
 

5655
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:44,470
struggle
and embracing the journey is the way

5656
01:36:44,470 --> 01:36:44,480
and embracing the journey is the way
 

5657
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:45,910
and embracing the journey is the way
that i would put it so you ultimately

5658
01:36:45,910 --> 01:36:45,920
that i would put it so you ultimately
 

5659
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:46,629
that i would put it so you ultimately
feel the

5660
01:36:46,629 --> 01:36:46,639
feel the
 

5661
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:47,910
feel the
journey isn't just something that

5662
01:36:47,910 --> 01:36:47,920
journey isn't just something that
 

5663
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:49,830
journey isn't just something that
happens to you your horse

5664
01:36:49,830 --> 01:36:49,840
happens to you your horse
 

5665

happens to you your horse
you shape it you shape it remember how i

i'm exaggerating a little bit but the
 

5675
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,590
i'm exaggerating a little bit but the
way that i think about this is

01:37:01,590 --> 01:37:01,600
way that i think about this is
 

5677
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,550
way that i think about this is
that if you look at the hub in the whole

5678
01:37:04,550 --> 01:37:04,560
that if you look at the hub in the whole
 

5679

that if you look at the hub in the whole

feeling miserable about myself i was
 

6139
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:04,870
feeling miserable about myself i was
like

i'm not worthy and i think that
this is a cognitive problem that we have

6144
01:45:11,510 --> 01:45:11,520
this is a cognitive problem that we have
 

6145
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:13,109
this is a cognitive problem that we have
we kind of

6146
01:45:13,109 --> 01:45:13,119
we kind of
 

6147
01:45:13,119 --> 01:45:14,709
we kind of
um it's kind of like when we're talking

6148
01:45:14,709 --> 01:45:14,719
um it's kind of like when we're talking
 

6149
01:45:14,719 --> 01:45:16,470
um it's kind of like when we're talking
about artificial general intelligence

6150
01:45:16,470 --> 01:45:16,480
about artificial general intelligence
 

6151
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:17,109
about artificial general intelligence
agi

agi
 

6153
01:45:17,119 --> 01:45:18,790
agi
of sort of we kind of have this

6154
01:45:18,790 --> 01:45:18,800
of sort of we kind of have this
 

6155
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:20,310
of sort of we kind of have this
definition that anything that machines

6156
01:45:20,310 --> 01:45:20,320
definition that anything that machines
 

6157
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:20,950
definition that anything that machines
can do

6158
01:45:20,950 --> 01:45:20,960
can do
 

6159
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:22,550
can do
is not intelligent right and anything

6160
01:45:22,550 --> 01:45:22,560
is not intelligent right and anything
 

6161
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:24,070
is not intelligent right and anything
that they can't do is intelligent

6162
01:45:24,070 --> 01:45:24,080
that they can't do is intelligent
 

6163
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:24,709
that they can't do is intelligent
therefore

6164
01:45:24,709 --> 01:45:24,719
therefore
 

6165
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:26,709
therefore
we narrow in our narrow narrow the field

6166
01:45:26,709 --> 01:45:26,719
we narrow in our narrow narrow the field
 

6167
01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:28,149
we narrow in our narrow narrow the field
of what intelligence truly means and as

6168
01:45:28,149 --> 01:45:28,159
of what intelligence truly means and as
 

6169
01:45:28,159 --> 01:45:30,149
of what intelligence truly means and as
soon as machine learning not intelligent

6170
01:45:30,149 --> 01:45:30,159
soon as machine learning not intelligent
 

6171
01:45:30,159 --> 01:45:30,870
soon as machine learning not intelligent
anymore

6172
01:45:30,870 --> 01:45:30,880
anymore
 

6173
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:31,990
anymore
i feel like i was doing the same thing

6174
01:45:31,990 --> 01:45:32,000
i feel like i was doing the same thing
 

6175
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,070
i feel like i was doing the same thing
with myself as soon as i could solve

6176
01:45:34,070 --> 01:45:34,080
with myself as soon as i could solve
 

6177
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:34,709
with myself as soon as i could solve
something

6178
01:45:34,709 --> 01:45:34,719
something
 

6179
01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:36,390
something
it was the kind of thing that a kid like

6180
01:45:36,390 --> 01:45:36,400
it was the kind of thing that a kid like
 

6181
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:38,149
it was the kind of thing that a kid like
me could solve and therefore it was kind

6182
01:45:38,149 --> 01:45:38,159
me could solve and therefore it was kind
 

6183
01:45:38,159 --> 01:45:39,669
me could solve and therefore it was kind
of easy

6184
01:45:39,669 --> 01:45:39,679
of easy
 

6185
01:45:39,679 --> 01:45:42,950
of easy
but to the others it seemed hard yeah

6186
01:45:42,950 --> 01:45:42,960

6188
01:45:44,870 --> 01:45:44,880
but to me it seemed easy so it was this
 

6189
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:46,390
but to me it seemed easy so it was this
kind of thing that everything that my

6190
01:45:46,390 --> 01:45:46,400
kind of thing that everything that my
 

6191
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:47,510
kind of thing that everything that my
colleagues were doing

6192
01:45:47,510 --> 01:45:47,520
colleagues were doing
 

6193
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:50,070
colleagues were doing
seemed impossible to me but everything

6194
01:45:50,070 --> 01:45:50,080
seemed impossible to me but everything
 

6195
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,350
seemed impossible to me but everything
that i was doing seemed impossible to

6196
01:45:51,350 --> 01:45:51,360
that i was doing seemed impossible to
 

6197
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:52,390
that i was doing seemed impossible to
them

6198

01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:54,470
them
so it was that realization that sort of

01:45:54,470 --> 01:45:54,480
so it was that realization that sort of
 

6201
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:55,430
so it was that realization that sort of
made me mature

6202
01:45:55,430 --> 01:45:55,440
made me mature
 

6203
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:58,149
made me mature
into sort of a not more confident but

6204
01:45:58,149 --> 01:45:58,159
into sort of a not more confident but
 

6205
01:45:58,159 --> 01:45:59,350
into sort of a not more confident but
more comfortable

to never be happy with anything he did
so there's a something powerful as a

6222
01:46:20,870 --> 01:46:20,880
so there's a something powerful as a
 

6223
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:22,229
so there's a something powerful as a

unimpressive
 

6233
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:32,470
unimpressive
what do you do with that because clearly

6234
01:46:32,470 --> 01:46:32,480
what do you do with that because clearly
 

6235
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:33,189
what do you do with that because clearly
that's a

6236
01:46:33,189 --> 01:46:33,199
that's a
 

6237
01:46:33,199 --> 01:46:35,270
that's a
i think useful thing i think i've kind

6238
01:46:35,270 --> 01:46:35,280
i think useful thing i think i've kind
 

6239
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:36,950
i think useful thing i think i've kind
of matured past that

6240
01:46:36,950 --> 01:46:36,960
of matured past that
 

6241
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:39,189
of matured past that
and i think the maturity past that is to

6242
01:46:39,189 --> 01:46:39,199
and i think the maturity past that is to
 

6243
01:46:39,199 --> 01:46:41,030
and i think the maturity past that is to
sort of accept

6244
01:46:41,030 --> 01:46:41,040
sort of accept
 

6245
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:44,629
sort of accept
what it is and accept that

6246
01:46:44,629 --> 01:46:44,639
what it is and accept that
 

6247
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:48,470
what it is and accept that
it has helped others build onto it

6248
01:46:48,470 --> 01:46:48,480
it has helped others build onto it
 

6249
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:51,430
it has helped others build onto it
and therefore advance human knowledge so

6250
01:46:51,430 --> 01:46:51,440
and therefore advance human knowledge so
 

6251
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:53,189
and therefore advance human knowledge so
it's very easy to sort of fall into the

6252
01:46:53,189 --> 01:46:53,199
it's very easy to sort of fall into the
 

6253
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:55,910
it's very easy to sort of fall into the
trap of oh everything i've done is crap

6254
01:46:55,910 --> 01:46:55,920
trap of oh everything i've done is crap
 

6255
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:58,070
trap of oh everything i've done is crap
what i told you last time is that i

6256
01:46:58,070 --> 01:46:58,080
what i told you last time is that i
 

6257
01:46:58,080 --> 01:46:59,590
what i told you last time is that i
always tell my students that our best

6258
01:46:59,590 --> 01:46:59,600
always tell my students that our best
 

6259

work is ahead of us
 

6261
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:04,629
work is ahead of us
and i think that's more of my mindset

6262
01:47:04,629 --> 01:47:04,639
and i think that's more of my mindset
 

6263
01:47:04,639 --> 01:47:05,990
and i think that's more of my mindset
that's a beautiful way to put it

6264
01:47:05,990 --> 01:47:06,000
that's a beautiful way to put it
 

6265
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:09,270
that's a beautiful way to put it
exactly what we've done is it's great

6266
01:47:09,270 --> 01:47:09,280
exactly what we've done is it's great
 

6267
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:11,270
exactly what we've done is it's great
it's great for the time and it'll become

6268
01:47:11,270 --> 01:47:11,280
it's great for the time and it'll become
 

6269
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:12,790
it's great for the time and it'll become
obsolete in 30 years

6270
01:47:12,790 --> 01:47:12,800
obsolete in 30 years
 

6271
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:15,270
obsolete in 30 years
yeah not we can we are doing even better

01:47:19,189 --> 01:47:19,199
exactly so basically our next work will
 

6277
01:47:19,199 --> 01:47:19,750
exactly so basically our next work will
just

yesterday

6288
01:47:28,390 --> 01:47:28,400
yesterday
 

6289
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:31,109
yesterday
and it was like listen we know this is

6290
01:47:31,109 --> 01:47:31,119
and it was like listen we know this is
 

6291
01:47:31,119 --> 01:47:32,709
and it was like listen we know this is
not perfect

6292
01:47:32,709 --> 01:47:32,719
not perfect
 

6293
01:47:32,719 --> 01:47:34,229
not perfect
but it's way better than anything that's

6294
01:47:34,229 --> 01:47:34,239
but it's way better than anything that's
 

6295
01:47:34,239 --> 01:47:36,149
but it's way better than anything that's
ever been done before

6296
01:47:36,149 --> 01:47:36,159
ever been done before
 

6297
01:47:36,159 --> 01:47:38,390
ever been done before
you know how to improve it but if you

6298
01:47:38,390 --> 01:47:38,400
you know how to improve it but if you
 

6299
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:39,669
you know how to improve it but if you
try to

6300

your paper is never going to get

6302
01:47:40,629 --> 01:47:40,639
your paper is never going to get
 

6303
01:47:40,639 --> 01:47:43,030
your paper is never going to get
published so

6304
01:47:43,030 --> 01:47:43,040
published so
 

6305
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:46,470
published so
so it you know there's this balance of

6306
01:47:46,470 --> 01:47:46,480
so it you know there's this balance of
 

6307
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:49,430
so it you know there's this balance of
we're already at the top of the field

6308
01:47:49,430 --> 01:47:49,440
we're already at the top of the field
 

6309
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:50,950
we're already at the top of the field
get it out

6310
01:47:50,950 --> 01:47:50,960
get it out
 

6311
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:52,070
get it out
and then you work on the next

6312
01:47:52,070 --> 01:47:52,080
and then you work on the next
 

6313
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:54,709
and then you work on the next
improvement and in my experience this

6314
01:47:54,709 --> 01:47:54,719
improvement and in my experience this
 

6315
01:47:54,719 --> 01:47:55,990
improvement and in my experience this
has never happened we've never actually

6316
01:47:55,990 --> 01:47:56,000
has never happened we've never actually
 

6317
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,270
has never happened we've never actually
worked on the next improvement and

6318
01:47:57,270 --> 01:47:57,280
worked on the next improvement and
 

6319
01:47:57,280 --> 01:47:59,109
worked on the next improvement and
that's okay

6320
01:47:59,109 --> 01:47:59,119
that's okay
 

6321
01:47:59,119 --> 01:48:00,629
that's okay
it didn't make a difference because

6322
01:48:00,629 --> 01:48:00,639
it didn't make a difference because
 

6323
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:02,470
it didn't make a difference because
