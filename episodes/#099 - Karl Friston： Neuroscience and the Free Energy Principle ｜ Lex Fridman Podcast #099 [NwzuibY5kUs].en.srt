has so you said a lot of interesting

328
00:06:57,809 --> 00:06:57,819
has so you said a lot of interesting
 

329
00:06:57,819 --> 00:06:59,580
has so you said a lot of interesting
terms here so the recurrence the

330
00:06:59,580 --> 00:06:59,590
terms here so the recurrence the
 

331
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,010
terms here so the recurrence the
sparsity but you also started by saying

332
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:02,020
sparsity but you also started by saying
 

333
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,249
sparsity but you also started by saying
hierarchical mm-hmm so I've I've never

334
00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:05,259
hierarchical mm-hmm so I've I've never
 

335
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:10,460
hierarchical mm-hmm so I've I've never
thought of our brain as hierarchical

336
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:10,470
thought of our brain as hierarchical
 

337
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,659
thought of our brain as hierarchical
sort of I always thought is just like a

338
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:12,669
sort of I always thought is just like a
 

339
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:16,050
sort of I always thought is just like a
giant mess an interconnected mess was

340
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:16,060
giant mess an interconnected mess was
 

341
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,850
giant mess an interconnected mess was
very difficult to figure anything out

342
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:17,860
very difficult to figure anything out
 

343
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,219
very difficult to figure anything out
but in what sense do you see the brain

344
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:20,229
but in what sense do you see the brain
 

345
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:22,890
but in what sense do you see the brain
is hierarchical well I see it's not a

346
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:22,900
is hierarchical well I see it's not a
 

347
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:28,050
is hierarchical well I see it's not a
magic soup yeah of course it's what I

348
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:28,060
magic soup yeah of course it's what I
 

349
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,129
magic soup yeah of course it's what I
used to think when I was before I

350
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:31,139
used to think when I was before I
 

351
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:36,360
used to think when I was before I
studied medicine and the like so a lot

352
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:36,370
studied medicine and the like so a lot
 

353
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:39,080
studied medicine and the like so a lot
of those terms imply each other so

354
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,090
of those terms imply each other so
 

355
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,760
of those terms imply each other so
hierarchies if you just think about the

356
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:41,770
hierarchies if you just think about the
 

357
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:44,100
hierarchies if you just think about the
nature of a hierarchy how would you

358
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,110
nature of a hierarchy how would you
 

359
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,709
nature of a hierarchy how would you
actually build one and what you would

360
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:46,719
actually build one and what you would
 

361
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:49,050
actually build one and what you would
have to do is basically carefully remove

362
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:49,060
have to do is basically carefully remove
 

363
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,640
have to do is basically carefully remove
the right connections that destroy the

364
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:52,650
the right connections that destroy the
 

365
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,930
the right connections that destroy the
completely connected soups that you

366
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:54,940
completely connected soups that you
 

367
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,379
completely connected soups that you
might have in mind so a hierarchy is in

00:07:58,379 --> 00:07:58,389
might have in mind so a hierarchy is in

00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,600
on any question is this about the
representational capacity or is it about

representational capacity or is it about
 

471

if one this simply thinks of the brain
 

477
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:30,309
if one this simply thinks of the brain
as a message passing machine a process

as a message passing machine a process
 

479

as a message passing machine a process
that is in the service of doing

00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:31,730
that is in the service of doing
 

481
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:36,009
that is in the service of doing
something then the the circuitry and the

something then the the circuitry and the
 

483
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:39,490
something then the the circuitry and the
connectivity that shape that message

484
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:39,500
connectivity that shape that message
 

485
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,989
connectivity that shape that message
passing also dictate its function so

486
00:10:42,989 --> 00:10:42,999
passing also dictate its function so
 

487
00:10:42,999 --> 00:10:45,429
passing also dictate its function so
you've done a lot of amazing work in a

489
00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:48,369
you've done a lot of amazing work in a
lot of directions so let's look at one

490
00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:48,379
lot of directions so let's look at one
 

491
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:51,160
lot of directions so let's look at one
aspect of that of looking into the brain

492
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,170
aspect of that of looking into the brain
 

493
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,350
aspect of that of looking into the brain
and trying to study this onion structure

494
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:53,360
and trying to study this onion structure
 

495
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,889
and trying to study this onion structure
of what can we learn about the brain by

496
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:56,899
of what can we learn about the brain by
 

497
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:59,440
of what can we learn about the brain by
imaging it which is one way to sort of

498
00:10:59,440 --> 00:10:59,450
imaging it which is one way to sort of
 

499
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,480

speaking what what are the methods of
 

503
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,460
speaking what what are the methods of
imaging but even bigger what can we

504
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:06,470
imaging but even bigger what can we
 

505
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,610
imaging but even bigger what can we
learn about it right so well most

506
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:09,620
learn about it right so well most
 

507
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,560
learn about it right so well most

00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:03,150
indeed
 

811
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,420
indeed
these functionally specialized responses

812
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:05,430
these functionally specialized responses
 

813
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,760
these functionally specialized responses
are very restricted and then they're

814
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:07,770
are very restricted and then they're
 

815
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,770
are very restricted and then they're
here or they're over there if I do this

816
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:09,780
here or they're over there if I do this
 

817
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,120
here or they're over there if I do this
then this part of the brain lights up

818
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,130
then this part of the brain lights up
 

819
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:16,420
then this part of the brain lights up
and that became doable in the early 90s

820
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:16,430
and that became doable in the early 90s
 

821
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,370
and that became doable in the early 90s
in fact shortly before with the advent

822
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:19,380
in fact shortly before with the advent
 

823
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,860
in fact shortly before with the advent
of positron emission tomography and then

824
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:21,870
of positron emission tomography and then
 

825
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,240
of positron emission tomography and then
functional magnetic resonance imaging

826
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:23,250
functional magnetic resonance imaging
 

827
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,590
functional magnetic resonance imaging
came along in the early 90s and since

828
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:27,600
came along in the early 90s and since
 

829
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,130
came along in the early 90s and since
that time there has been an explosion of

830
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:30,140
that time there has been an explosion of
 

831
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:36,110
that time there has been an explosion of
discovery refinement confirmation you

832
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:36,120
discovery refinement confirmation you
 

833
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,250
discovery refinement confirmation you
know there are people who believe that

834
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:37,260
know there are people who believe that
 

835
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,110
know there are people who believe that
it's all in the anatomy if you

836
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,120
it's all in the anatomy if you
 

837
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,490
it's all in the anatomy if you
understand the anatomy then you

838
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:40,500
understand the anatomy then you
 

839
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,560
understand the anatomy then you
understand the function at some level

840
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:42,570
understand the function at some level
 

841
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,680
understand the function at some level
and many many hypotheses were predicated

842
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:45,690
and many many hypotheses were predicated
 

843
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,530
and many many hypotheses were predicated
on a deep understanding of the anatomy

844
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:48,540
on a deep understanding of the anatomy
 

845
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,420
on a deep understanding of the anatomy
and the connectivity but they were all

846
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:50,430
and the connectivity but they were all
 

847
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:53,990
and the connectivity but they were all
confirmed and taking much further with

848
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,000
confirmed and taking much further with
 

849
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,150
confirmed and taking much further with
newer imaging so that's what I meant by

850
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:56,160
newer imaging so that's what I meant by
 

851
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,560
newer imaging so that's what I meant by
we've made an enormous amount of

852
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:57,570
we've made an enormous amount of
 

853
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,310
we've made an enormous amount of
progress in in this century indeed and

854
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:01,320
progress in in this century indeed and
 

855
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,360
progress in in this century indeed and
in relation to the previous century by

856
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:04,370
in relation to the previous century by
 

857
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,850
in relation to the previous century by
looking at these funky selective

858
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:07,860
looking at these funky selective
 

859
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,280
looking at these funky selective
responses but that wasn't the whole

860
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:10,290
responses but that wasn't the whole
 

861
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,620
responses but that wasn't the whole
story so there's a sort of near

862
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:12,630
story so there's a sort of near
 

863
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,570
story so there's a sort of near
phrenology but finding bumps and

864
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:14,580
phrenology but finding bumps and
 

865
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,220
phrenology but finding bumps and
hotspots in the brain that did this or

866
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:16,230
hotspots in the brain that did this or
 

867
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,490
hotspots in the brain that did this or
that the bigger question was of course

868
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:19,500
that the bigger question was of course
 

869
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,610
that the bigger question was of course
the functional integration how all of

870
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:22,620
the functional integration how all of
 

871
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,050
the functional integration how all of
these regionally specific responses were

872
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:27,060
these regionally specific responses were
 

873
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,540
these regionally specific responses were
orchestrated how they were distributed

874
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:29,550
orchestrated how they were distributed
 

875
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,120
orchestrated how they were distributed
how did they relate to distributed

876
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:32,130
how did they relate to distributed
 

877
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,490
how did they relate to distributed
processing and indeed representations in

878
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:34,500
processing and indeed representations in
 

879
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,060
processing and indeed representations in
the brain so then you turn to the more

880
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:38,070
the brain so then you turn to the more
 

881
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:41,090
the brain so then you turn to the more
challenging issue of the integration the

882
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:41,100
challenging issue of the integration the
 

883
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,460
challenging issue of the integration the
connectivity and then we come back to

884
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:43,470
connectivity and then we come back to
 

885
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,190
connectivity and then we come back to
this beautiful sparse recurrent

886
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:46,200
this beautiful sparse recurrent
 

887
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,490
this beautiful sparse recurrent
hierarchical connectivity that seems

888
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:49,500
hierarchical connectivity that seems
 

889
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,500
hierarchical connectivity that seems
characteristic of the brain and probably

890
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:51,510
characteristic of the brain and probably
 

891
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:55,400
characteristic of the brain and probably
not many other organs and but

892
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:55,410
not many other organs and but
 

893
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,600
not many other organs and but
nevertheless we'll come back to this

894
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:56,610
nevertheless we'll come back to this
 

895
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:59,420
nevertheless we'll come back to this
this challenge of trying to figure out

896
00:19:59,420 --> 00:19:59,430
this challenge of trying to figure out
 

897
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,030
this challenge of trying to figure out
how everything is integrated but what's

898
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:02,040
how everything is integrated but what's
 

899
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,290
how everything is integrated but what's
your feeling what's the general

900
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:03,300
your feeling what's the general
 

901
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,480
your feeling what's the general
consensus how we moved away from the

902
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:05,490
consensus how we moved away from the
 

903
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,970
consensus how we moved away from the
magic soup view of the brain yes so

904
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:07,980
magic soup view of the brain yes so
 

905
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,580
magic soup view of the brain yes so
there is a deep structure to it yeah

906
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:10,590
there is a deep structure to it yeah
 

907
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:14,510
there is a deep structure to it yeah
that and then maybe further question you

908
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:14,520
that and then maybe further question you
 

909
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,040
that and then maybe further question you
said some people believe that the

910
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,050
said some people believe that the
 

911
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,560
said some people believe that the
structure is most of it that you can

912
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:18,570
structure is most of it that you can
 

913
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,180
structure is most of it that you can
really get at the core of the function

914
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:20,190
really get at the core of the function
 

915
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,650
really get at the core of the function
by just deeply understanding the

916
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:21,660
by just deeply understanding the
 

917
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,080
by just deeply understanding the
structure yeah where do you sit on that

918
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,090
structure yeah where do you sit on that
 

919
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:24,620
structure yeah where do you sit on that
do you

920
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:24,630
do you
 

921
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,990
do you
I think it's called some monster yes

922
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:27,000
I think it's called some monster yes
 

923
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,960
I think it's called some monster yes
yeah yes it's a worthy pursuit of going

924
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:29,970
yeah yes it's a worthy pursuit of going
 

925
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,860
yeah yes it's a worthy pursuit of going
of studying of through imaging and all

926
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:33,870
of studying of through imaging and all
 

927
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,330
of studying of through imaging and all
the different methods to actually study

928
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:35,340
the different methods to actually study
 

929
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,480
the different methods to actually study
no absolutely let's go yeah yeah sorry

930
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:38,490
no absolutely let's go yeah yeah sorry
 

931
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,460
no absolutely let's go yeah yeah sorry
I'm just I'm just nutty you you you were

932
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:40,470
I'm just I'm just nutty you you you were
 

933
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,290
I'm just I'm just nutty you you you were
accusing me of using lots of long words

934
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:42,300
accusing me of using lots of long words
 

935
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,790
accusing me of using lots of long words
and then you introduce one that which is

936
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:43,800
and then you introduce one that which is
 

937
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,460
and then you introduce one that which is
deep which is interesting and because

938
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:46,470
deep which is interesting and because
 

939
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,480
deep which is interesting and because
deep is this or Millenial equivalent of

940
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:50,490
deep is this or Millenial equivalent of
 

941
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,760
deep is this or Millenial equivalent of
hierarchical so if you've put a deep in

942
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:52,770
hierarchical so if you've put a deep in
 

943
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,910
hierarchical so if you've put a deep in
front of anything

944
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:54,920
front of anything
 

945
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,170
front of anything
you're very millennial and start

946
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:57,180
you're very millennial and start
 

947
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,610
you're very millennial and start
trending but you yes you're also

948
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:58,620
trending but you yes you're also
 

949
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,700
trending but you yes you're also
implying a hierarchical architecture so

950
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:01,710
implying a hierarchical architecture so
 

951
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,220
implying a hierarchical architecture so
that's it is a depth which is for me the

952
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:04,230
that's it is a depth which is for me the
 

953
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,320
that's it is a depth which is for me the
beautiful thing that's right the word

954
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:06,330
beautiful thing that's right the word
 

955
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,630
beautiful thing that's right the word
deep kind of yeah exactly it implies

956
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:08,640
deep kind of yeah exactly it implies
 

957
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,270
deep kind of yeah exactly it implies
hierarchy I didn't even think about that

958
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:11,280
hierarchy I didn't even think about that
 

959
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,810
hierarchy I didn't even think about that
that indeed the implicit meaning of the

960
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:14,820
that indeed the implicit meaning of the
 

961
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:18,020
that indeed the implicit meaning of the
word deep is a hierarchy yep yeah yeah

962
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,030
word deep is a hierarchy yep yeah yeah
 

963
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,090
word deep is a hierarchy yep yeah yeah
so deep inside the onion is a central

964
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:20,100
so deep inside the onion is a central
 

965
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:25,700
so deep inside the onion is a central
view so if you put maybe briefly if you

966
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:25,710
view so if you put maybe briefly if you
 

967
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:28,280
view so if you put maybe briefly if you
could paint a picture of the kind of

968
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:28,290
could paint a picture of the kind of
 

969
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:31,400
could paint a picture of the kind of
methods of neuro imaging maybe the

970
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:31,410

so there's a ton of it seems like

1064
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:26,910
so there's a ton of it seems like
 

1065
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,490
so there's a ton of it seems like
there's a ton of blood vessels in the

there's a ton of blood vessels in the
 

1067
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,030
there's a ton of blood vessels in the
brain yeah so but what's the interaction

1068
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:32,040
brain yeah so but what's the interaction
 

1069
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,950

1073
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,870

dogs and looking at how they responded
 

1539
00:33:51,849 --> 00:33:54,359
dogs and looking at how they responded
either but with them the muscles or with

1540
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:54,369
either but with them the muscles or with
 

1541
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:59,430
either but with them the muscles or with
the salivation and imputing what that

1542
00:33:59,430 --> 00:33:59,440
the salivation and imputing what that
 

1543
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,109
the salivation and imputing what that
part of the brain must be doing that if

part of the brain must be doing that if
 

1545
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:04,259
part of the brain must be doing that if
i stimulated then yeah and i vote this

1546
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:04,269
i stimulated then yeah and i vote this
 

1547
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:06,779
i stimulated then yeah and i vote this
kind of response then that tells me

1548
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:06,789
kind of response then that tells me
 

1549
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:07,919
kind of response then that tells me
quite a lot about the functional

1550
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:07,929
quite a lot about the functional
 

1551
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:10,019
quite a lot about the functional
specialization so there's a long history

1552
00:34:10,019 --> 00:34:10,029
specialization so there's a long history
 

1553
00:34:10,029 --> 00:34:14,069
specialization so there's a long history
of brain stimulation which in continues

right so good example here imagine you
had some very aggressive satellites that

asking now is can i meaningfully get
 

1771
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:58,959
asking now is can i meaningfully get
into the weather and change it

1772

into the weather and change it
 

1773
00:39:58,969 --> 00:40:00,309
into the weather and change it
meaningfully and make the weather

so I think the example the weather is a

00:41:12,049 --> 00:41:14,049
so I think the example the weather is a
brilliant one and I think you paint a

a hope that so machine learning methods

a hope that so machine learning methods
will will help us play in the soup as

will will help us play in the soup as

me what seems impossible is is the

me what seems impossible is is the

00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:19,809
me what seems impossible is is the

me that engineering challenge seems

me that engineering challenge seems
 

1879
00:42:30,019 --> 00:42:32,140
me that engineering challenge seems
nearly impossible one of the things I

nearly impossible one of the things I
 

1881
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:36,209
nearly impossible one of the things I
was really impressed by at neuro-link is

1882
00:42:36,209 --> 00:42:36,219
was really impressed by at neuro-link is
 

1883
00:42:36,219 --> 00:42:38,739
was really impressed by at neuro-link is
just just talking to brilliant

just just talking to brilliant
neurosurgeons and the roboticists that

1886
00:42:41,549 --> 00:42:41,559
neurosurgeons and the roboticists that
 

1887
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,229
neurosurgeons and the roboticists that
it made me realize that even though it

1888
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:44,239
it made me realize that even though it
 

1889
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:46,779
it made me realize that even though it
seems impossible if anyone can do it

1890
00:42:46,779 --> 00:42:46,789
seems impossible if anyone can do it
 

1891
00:42:46,789 --> 00:42:49,059
seems impossible if anyone can do it
it's some of these world-class engineers

1892
00:42:49,059 --> 00:42:49,069
it's some of these world-class engineers
 

1893
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:52,569
it's some of these world-class engineers
that are trying to take it on so so I

1894
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:52,579
that are trying to take it on so so I
 

1895
00:42:52,579 --> 00:42:54,849
that are trying to take it on so so I
think the conclusion of our discussion

1896
00:42:54,849 --> 00:42:54,859
think the conclusion of our discussion
 

1897
00:42:54,859 --> 00:42:58,380
think the conclusion of our discussion
here is of this part is is basically

1898
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:58,390
here is of this part is is basically
 

1899
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:00,999
here is of this part is is basically
that the problem is really hard but

1900
00:43:00,999 --> 00:43:01,009
that the problem is really hard but
 

1901
00:43:01,009 --> 00:43:03,909
that the problem is really hard but
hopefully not impossible absolutely so

1902
00:43:03,909 --> 00:43:03,919
hopefully not impossible absolutely so
 

1903
00:43:03,919 --> 00:43:07,029
hopefully not impossible absolutely so
if it's ok let's start with the basics

1904
00:43:07,029 --> 00:43:07,039
if it's ok let's start with the basics
 

1905
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:11,679
if it's ok let's start with the basics
so you've also formulated a fascinating

1906
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:11,689
so you've also formulated a fascinating
 

1907
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:13,390
so you've also formulated a fascinating
principle the free energy principle

1908
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:13,400
principle the free energy principle
 

1909
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,429
principle the free energy principle
could we maybe start at the basics and

1910
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:15,439
could we maybe start at the basics and
 

1911
00:43:15,439 --> 00:43:19,809
could we maybe start at the basics and
what is the free energy principle well

1912
00:43:19,809 --> 00:43:19,819
what is the free energy principle well
 

1913
00:43:19,819 --> 00:43:23,249
what is the free energy principle well
in fact the free energy principle

1914
00:43:23,249 --> 00:43:23,259
in fact the free energy principle
 

1915
00:43:23,259 --> 00:43:29,319
in fact the free energy principle
inherits a lot from the building of

1916
00:43:29,319 --> 00:43:29,329

as you get get from the brain so I think
 

1923
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:38,019
as you get get from the brain so I think
is interesting to acknowledge that and

1924
00:43:38,019 --> 00:43:38,029
is interesting to acknowledge that and
 

1925
00:43:38,029 --> 00:43:40,830
is interesting to acknowledge that and
in particular the analysis tools that

1926
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:40,840
in particular the analysis tools that
 

1927

is can be cast as a an inference problem
 

1949
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:21,300
is can be cast as a an inference problem
in the sense that you can interpret the

00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:21,310
in the sense that you can interpret the
 

1951
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:24,540
in the sense that you can interpret the

00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:45,750
the ensemble dynamics that must be in
play in the service of that inference so

1966
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:45,760
play in the service of that inference so
 

1967
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,360
play in the service of that inference so
technically what that means is you can

1968
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:48,370
technically what that means is you can
 

1969
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:52,080
technically what that means is you can
always interpret anything that exists in

00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,800
to minimize variational free-energy and
if you're from the machine learning

1978
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:04,810
if you're from the machine learning
 

1979
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:07,080
if you're from the machine learning
community you will know that as a

1980
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:07,090
community you will know that as a
 

1981
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:09,330
community you will know that as a
negative evidence lower bound or a

1982
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:09,340
negative evidence lower bound or a
 

1983
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,780
negative evidence lower bound or a
negative elbow which is the same as

1984
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:12,790
negative elbow which is the same as
 

1985
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:15,630
negative elbow which is the same as
saying you're trying to maximize or it

1986
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:15,640
saying you're trying to maximize or it
 

1987
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,910
saying you're trying to maximize or it
will look as if all your dynamics are

1988
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:17,920
will look as if all your dynamics are
 

1989
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,570
will look as if all your dynamics are
trying to maximize the complement of

00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:21,580
trying to maximize the complement of
 

1991
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,850
trying to maximize the complement of
that which is the marginal likelihood or

1992
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:23,860
that which is the marginal likelihood or
 

1993
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:26,580
that which is the marginal likelihood or
the evidence for your own existence so

1994
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:26,590
the evidence for your own existence so
 

1995
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:28,830
the evidence for your own existence so
that's basically that you know that the

1996
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:28,840
that's basically that you know that the
 

1997
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,600
that's basically that you know that the
free energy principle of it but even

1998
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:30,610
free energy principle of it but even
 

1999
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:34,080
free energy principle of it but even
take a sort of a small step back or as

2000
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:34,090
take a sort of a small step back or as
 

2001
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:37,490
take a sort of a small step back or as
you said the existential imperative

2002
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:37,500
you said the existential imperative
 

2003
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,840
you said the existential imperative
there's a lot of beautiful poetic words

2004
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:39,850
there's a lot of beautiful poetic words
 

2005
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:43,200
there's a lot of beautiful poetic words
here but to put it crudely there's a

2006
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:43,210
here but to put it crudely there's a
 

2007
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:47,370
here but to put it crudely there's a
it's a fascinating idea of basically

2008
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:47,380
it's a fascinating idea of basically
 

2009
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,770
it's a fascinating idea of basically
just of trying to describe if you're

2010
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:49,780
just of trying to describe if you're
 

2011
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,440
just of trying to describe if you're
looking at a blob how do you know this

2012
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:52,450
looking at a blob how do you know this
 

2013
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:53,950
looking at a blob how do you know this
thing is alive

2014
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:53,960
thing is alive
 

2015
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,900
thing is alive
what does it mean to be alive what does

2016
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:55,910
what does it mean to be alive what does
 

2017
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:58,299
what does it mean to be alive what does
it mean to be to exist and so you can

2018
00:45:58,299 --> 00:45:58,309
it mean to be to exist and so you can
 

2019
00:45:58,309 --> 00:46:00,130
it mean to be to exist and so you can
look at the brain you can look at parts

2020
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:00,140
look at the brain you can look at parts
 

2021
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:01,930
look at the brain you can look at parts
of the brain or you this is just the

2022
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:01,940
of the brain or you this is just the
 

2023
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:04,000
of the brain or you this is just the
general principle that applies to almost

2024
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:04,010
general principle that applies to almost
 

2025
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:07,390
general principle that applies to almost
thing and ye and you system it that's

2026
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:07,400
thing and ye and you system it that's
 

2027
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,650
thing and ye and you system it that's
just a fascinating sort of

2028
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:08,660
just a fascinating sort of
 

2029
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:12,010
just a fascinating sort of
philosophically at every level question

2030
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:12,020
philosophically at every level question
 

2031
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,750
philosophically at every level question
and the methodology to try to answer

2032
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:13,760
and the methodology to try to answer
 

2033
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,160
and the methodology to try to answer
that question what does it mean to be

2034
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:15,170
that question what does it mean to be
 

2035
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:20,440
that question what does it mean to be
alive yeah so that that that's a huge

2036
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:20,450
alive yeah so that that that's a huge
 

2037
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:21,970
alive yeah so that that that's a huge
endeavor and it's nice that there's at

2038
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:21,980
endeavor and it's nice that there's at
 

2039
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,549
endeavor and it's nice that there's at
least some from some perspective a clean

2040
00:46:24,549 --> 00:46:24,559
least some from some perspective a clean
 

2041
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:26,530
least some from some perspective a clean
answer so maybe can you talk about that

2042
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:26,540
answer so maybe can you talk about that
 

2043
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:31,180
answer so maybe can you talk about that
optimization view of it so what what's

2044
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:31,190
optimization view of it so what what's
 

2045
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:33,309
optimization view of it so what what's
trying to be minimized to maximize what

2046
00:46:33,309 --> 00:46:33,319
trying to be minimized to maximize what
 

2047
00:46:33,319 --> 00:46:35,349
trying to be minimized to maximize what
a system that's alive what is it trying

2048
00:46:35,349 --> 00:46:35,359
a system that's alive what is it trying
 

2049
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,870
a system that's alive what is it trying
to minimize right you've you've made a

2050
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:37,880
to minimize right you've you've made a
 

2051
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:46,690
to minimize right you've you've made a
big move yes to make big moves but

2052
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:46,700
big move yes to make big moves but
 

2053
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:50,559
big move yes to make big moves but
you've assumed that the things the thing

2054
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:50,569
you've assumed that the things the thing
 

2055
00:46:50,569 --> 00:46:52,930
you've assumed that the things the thing
exists before the in a state that could

2056
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:52,940
exists before the in a state that could
 

2057
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:56,079
exists before the in a state that could
be living on nonliving so I may ask you

2058
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:56,089
be living on nonliving so I may ask you
 

2059
00:46:56,089 --> 00:46:58,839
be living on nonliving so I may ask you
or what licenses you to say that

2060
00:46:58,839 --> 00:46:58,849
or what licenses you to say that
 

2061
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:00,819
or what licenses you to say that
something exists that's why I use the

2062
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:00,829
something exists that's why I use the
 

2063
00:47:00,829 --> 00:47:03,700
something exists that's why I use the
word existential it's beyond living it's

2064
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:03,710
word existential it's beyond living it's
 

2065
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:07,000
word existential it's beyond living it's
just existence so if you drill down onto

2066
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:07,010
just existence so if you drill down onto
 

2067
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:11,319
just existence so if you drill down onto
the definition of things that exist then

2068
00:47:11,319 --> 00:47:11,329
the definition of things that exist then
 

2069
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:13,870
the definition of things that exist then
they have certain properties if you

2070
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:13,880
they have certain properties if you
 

2071
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:17,380
they have certain properties if you
borrow the maths from non-equilibrium

2072
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:17,390

2207
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,490

heat bath get there and why is it not

2208
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:40,500
heat bath get there and why is it not
 

2209
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,650

dissolved why was it maintaining itself

2210
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:42,660
dissolved why was it maintaining itself
 

2211
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,780

exactly what actions is it I mean it's

2212
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:44,790
exactly what actions is it I mean it's

00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:47,240
exactly what actions is it I mean it's
such a fascinating idea of a drop of oil

2214

such a fascinating idea of a drop of oil
 

2215
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:49,550
such a fascinating idea of a drop of oil
and I guess it would dissolve in water

2216
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:49,560
and I guess it would dissolve in water
 

2217
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:52,160
and I guess it would dissolve in water
wouldn't dissolve in water so what

2218
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:52,170
wouldn't dissolve in water so what
 

2219
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:54,770
wouldn't dissolve in water so what
precisely so why not so why not why not

2220
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:54,780
precisely so why not so why not why not
 

2221
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,960
precisely so why not so why not why not
and how do you mathematically describe

does the drop of oil and yeah and where
 

2229
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:09,380
does the drop of oil and yeah and where
does it begin right so I mean you're

2230
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:09,390
does it begin right so I mean you're
 

2231
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:11,809
does it begin right so I mean you're
asking the questions deep in in a normal

2232
00:51:11,809 --> 00:51:11,819
asking the questions deep in in a normal
 

2233
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:19,460
asking the questions deep in in a normal
area but what you can do you see so this

2234
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:19,470
area but what you can do you see so this
 

2235
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:21,290
area but what you can do you see so this
is a deflationary part of it

2236
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:21,300
is a deflationary part of it
 

2237
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,540
is a deflationary part of it
can I just qualify mouths so by saying

2238
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:23,550
can I just qualify mouths so by saying
 

2239
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:24,530
can I just qualify mouths so by saying
that normally when I'm asked this

2240
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:24,540
that normally when I'm asked this
 

2241
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:25,940
that normally when I'm asked this
question I answer from the point of view

2242
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:25,950
question I answer from the point of view
 

2243
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:27,109
question I answer from the point of view
of a psychologist we talk about

2244
00:51:27,109 --> 00:51:27,119
of a psychologist we talk about
 

2245
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,210
of a psychologist we talk about
predictive processing and pretty coding

2246
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:29,220
predictive processing and pretty coding
 

2247
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,160
predictive processing and pretty coding
and you know the brain is an inference

2248
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:31,170
and you know the brain is an inference
 

2249
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:33,470
and you know the brain is an inference
machine but you haven't asked me from

2250
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:33,480
machine but you haven't asked me from
 

2251
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,000
machine but you haven't asked me from
that perspective I'm answering from the

2252
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:35,010
that perspective I'm answering from the
 

2253
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:37,910
that perspective I'm answering from the
point of view of a physicist so you you

2254
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:37,920
point of view of a physicist so you you
 

2255
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,329
point of view of a physicist so you you
know the question is not so much why but

2256
00:51:41,329 --> 00:51:41,339
know the question is not so much why but
 

2257
00:51:41,339 --> 00:51:43,790
know the question is not so much why but
if it exists what properties must it

2258
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:43,800
if it exists what properties must it
 

2259
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,069
if it exists what properties must it
display so that's the deflation in part

2260
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:46,079
display so that's the deflation in part
 

2261
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:47,510
display so that's the deflation in part
the 300 prints we print the 300

00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:38,510
the same mathematical calm construct so
 

2341
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:41,110
the same mathematical calm construct so
the very emergence of existence of

2342
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:41,120
the very emergence of existence of
 

2343
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,120
the very emergence of existence of
structure or form that can be

distinguished from the environment or
 

2347
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:49,260
distinguished from the environment or
the thing that is not the thing

2348
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:49,270

 

2349
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:53,200

necessitates the you know the existence

2350
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:53,210
necessitates the you know the existence
 

2351
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:56,770
necessitates the you know the existence
of an objective function then it looks

2352
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:56,780
of an objective function then it looks
 

2353
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:58,750
of an objective function then it looks
as if it is minimizing it's finally a

2354
00:53:58,750 --> 00:53:58,760
as if it is minimizing it's finally a
 

2355
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:02,050
as if it is minimizing it's finally a
free energy minima and so just to

2356
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:02,060
free energy minima and so just to
 

2357
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:03,700
free energy minima and so just to
clarify I'm trying to wrap my head

2358
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:03,710
clarify I'm trying to wrap my head
 

2359
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:07,080
clarify I'm trying to wrap my head
around so the the free energy principle

2360
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:07,090
around so the the free energy principle
 

2361
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:10,030
around so the the free energy principle
says that if something exists these are

2362
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:10,040
says that if something exists these are
 

2363
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,900
says that if something exists these are
the properties it should display yes so

2364
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:12,910
the properties it should display yes so
 

2365
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:16,360
the properties it should display yes so
what what that means is we can't just

2366
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:16,370
what what that means is we can't just
 

2367
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:19,270
what what that means is we can't just
look we can't just go into a soup and

2368
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:19,280
look we can't just go into a soup and
 

2369
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,000
look we can't just go into a soup and
there's no mechanism if free energy

2370
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:22,010
there's no mechanism if free energy
 

2371
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:23,650
there's no mechanism if free energy
principle doesn't give us a mechanism to

2372
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:23,660
principle doesn't give us a mechanism to
 

2373
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:27,820
principle doesn't give us a mechanism to
find the things that exist is that what

2374
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:27,830
find the things that exist is that what
 

2375
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:30,900
find the things that exist is that what
it was implying is being applied that

00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:30,910
it was implying is being applied that
 

2377
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:34,720

you can kind of use it to reason to

2378
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:34,730
you can kind of use it to reason to
 

2379
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:37,000
you can kind of use it to reason to
think about like study a particular

00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:37,010
think about like study a particular
 

2381
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:37,780
think about like study a particular
system and say

does this exhibit these qualities that's
 

2385
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:44,470
does this exhibit these qualities that's
an excellent question to answer that

2386
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:44,480
an excellent question to answer that
 

2387
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,510
an excellent question to answer that
after I have to return to your previous

2388
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:46,520
after I have to return to your previous
 

2389
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,500
after I have to return to your previous
question but what's the difference

2390
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:47,510
question but what's the difference
 

2391
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:51,360
question but what's the difference
between living and nonliving things

2392
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:51,370
between living and nonliving things
 

2393
00:54:51,370 --> 00:54:54,430
between living and nonliving things
actually Society so yeah that maybe we

2394
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:54,440
actually Society so yeah that maybe we
 

2395
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,860
actually Society so yeah that maybe we
can go there you kind of drew a line and

2396
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:56,870
can go there you kind of drew a line and
 

2397
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:58,870
can go there you kind of drew a line and
and forgive me for the stupid questions

2398
00:54:58,870 --> 00:54:58,880
and forgive me for the stupid questions
 

2399
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,340
and forgive me for the stupid questions
but the you kind of draw a line between

2400
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:00,350
but the you kind of draw a line between
 

2401
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:03,000
but the you kind of draw a line between
living and existing yeah is there an

2402
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:03,010
living and existing yeah is there an
 

2403
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:06,310
living and existing yeah is there an
interesting sort of distinction

2404
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:06,320
interesting sort of distinction
 

2405
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,270
interesting sort of distinction
distinction

2406
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:07,280
distinction
 

2407
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:13,120
distinction
yeah I think there is so you know things

2408
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:13,130
yeah I think there is so you know things
 

2409
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:15,730
yeah I think there is so you know things
do exist grains of sand rocks on the

2410
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:15,740
do exist grains of sand rocks on the
 

2411
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:21,390
do exist grains of sand rocks on the
moon trees you so all of these things

2412
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:21,400
moon trees you so all of these things
 

2413
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:25,000
moon trees you so all of these things
can be separated from the environment in

2414
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:25,010
can be separated from the environment in
 

2415
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:26,800
can be separated from the environment in
which they are immersed and therefore

2416
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:26,810
which they are immersed and therefore
 

2417
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:29,190
which they are immersed and therefore
there must at some level be optimizing

2418
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:29,200
there must at some level be optimizing
 

2419
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,690
there must at some level be optimizing

00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:38,540
quantity that basically means their self

00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:41,100
quantity that basically means their self
evidencing another nice little twist of

2426
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:41,110
evidencing another nice little twist of
 

2427
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:43,750
evidencing another nice little twist of
phrase here is that you are your own

2428
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:43,760
phrase here is that you are your own
 

2429
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,030
phrase here is that you are your own
existence proof you know statistically

2430
00:55:46,030 --> 00:55:46,040
existence proof you know statistically
 

2431
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:49,930
existence proof you know statistically
speaking which I don't think I said that

2432
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:49,940
speaking which I don't think I said that
 

2433
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:53,680
speaking which I don't think I said that
somebody did but I love that phrase you

2434
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:53,690
somebody did but I love that phrase you
 

2435
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:55,960
somebody did but I love that phrase you
are your own existence proof yeah

2436
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:55,970
are your own existence proof yeah
 

2437
00:55:55,970 --> 00:55:59,290
are your own existence proof yeah
so it's ur existential isn't it I'm

2438
00:55:59,290 --> 00:55:59,300
so it's ur existential isn't it I'm
 

2439
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:00,520
so it's ur existential isn't it I'm
gonna have to think about there for a

2440
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:00,530
gonna have to think about there for a
 

2441
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:02,370
gonna have to think about there for a
few days

2442
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:02,380
few days
 

2443
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:05,410
few days
yeah the view there's a beautiful line

2444
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:05,420
yeah the view there's a beautiful line
 

2445
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:09,310
yeah the view there's a beautiful line
so the the step through to answer your

2446
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:09,320
so the the step through to answer your
 

2447
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,020
so the the step through to answer your
question about you know what's it good

2448
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:11,030
question about you know what's it good

00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:15,230
for big girl on the following lines
 

2451
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:18,220
for big girl on the following lines
first of all you have to define what it

2452
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:18,230
first of all you have to define what it
 

2453
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:21,160
first of all you have to define what it
means to exist which down as you rightly

2454
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:21,170
means to exist which down as you rightly
 

2455
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,380
means to exist which down as you rightly
pointed out you have to define what

it knows where it finishes and then you

2462
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:31,070
it knows where it finishes and then you
 

2463
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:32,800
it knows where it finishes and then you
write out that down in terms of

2464
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:32,810
write out that down in terms of
 

2465
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:34,780
write out that down in terms of
statistical independence is again

2466
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:34,790
statistical independence is again

or what score elated or what depends
 

2471
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:43,720
or what score elated or what depends
upon what it's what's not correlated and

what doesn't depend upon something again
 

2475
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:48,940
what doesn't depend upon something again
it comes down to the the deeper

2489
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:07,750
the oil drop from the water in which it

is immersed and when you do that you
 

2491
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,910
is immersed and when you do that you
start to realize well there are actually

00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:09,920
start to realize well there are actually
 

2493
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,569
start to realize well there are actually
four sub kinds of states in any given

00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:24,290
which is why I use a metaphor a little

interior and exterior and then the the
 

2509
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:30,180
interior and exterior and then the the

2510
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:30,190
surface of the cell and that's
 

2511
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:33,010

mathematically a Markov blanket just to
 

2513
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:35,020
mathematically a Markov blanket just to

pause I'm in awe of this concept that
 

2515
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:36,370
pause I'm in awe of this concept that
there's the stuff outside the surface

2516
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:36,380
there's the stuff outside the surface
 

2517
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:38,140
there's the stuff outside the surface

00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:43,790
most beautiful kind of notion about

00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:46,630
most beautiful kind of notion about
trying to explore what it means to exist

2524

you're automatically I apologize this is

2526
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:49,700
you're automatically I apologize this is
 

2527
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,190
you're automatically I apologize this is
a beautiful idea but came out of

2528
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:51,200
a beautiful idea but came out of
 

2529
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,069
a beautiful idea but came out of
California so that's I changed my mind I

2530
00:57:54,069 --> 00:57:54,079
California so that's I changed my mind I
 

2531
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:58,930
California so that's I changed my mind I
take it all so sorry anyway so what you

2532
00:57:58,930 --> 00:57:58,940
take it all so sorry anyway so what you
 

2533
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,099
take it all so sorry anyway so what you
were just talking about the surface

2534
00:58:00,099 --> 00:58:00,109
were just talking about the surface
 

2535
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:02,980
were just talking about the surface
about the market yeah so this surface or

2536
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:02,990
about the market yeah so this surface or
 

2537
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:04,809
about the market yeah so this surface or
this blanket these blanket states that

2538
00:58:04,809 --> 00:58:04,819
this blanket these blanket states that
 

2539
00:58:04,819 --> 00:58:09,190
this blanket these blanket states that
are this you know the because they are

2540
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:09,200
are this you know the because they are
 

2541
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:16,440
are this you know the because they are

01:00:09,819 --> 01:00:09,829
be influenced by the external states and
 

2623
01:00:09,829 --> 01:00:11,499
be influenced by the external states and
we already know that the internal States

we already know that the internal States
 

2625
01:00:11,509 --> 01:00:13,210
we already know that the internal States

so what does that mean well it means the

01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:16,999
so what does that mean well it means the
 

2631
01:00:16,999 --> 01:00:19,059
so what does that mean well it means the

2633
01:00:19,069 --> 01:00:22,569

dynamics so now you've got a picture of

2638
01:00:27,970 --> 01:00:27,980

it has autonomous States it has
autonomous days in the sense that there

01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:39,609
must be some parts of the surface of the

external states and all the Interior and
 

2651
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,859
external states and all the Interior and
together those two states endow even a

01:00:44,859 --> 01:00:44,869
together those two states endow even a
 

2653
01:00:44,869 --> 01:00:47,319
together those two states endow even a
little oil drop with autonomous states

01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:53,289
that look as if they are optimizing
their variational free energy or their

and that would be an interesting
 

2663
01:01:01,329 --> 01:01:03,870
and that would be an interesting
intellectual exercise and you could say

2664

intellectual exercise and you could say
 

2665
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,910
intellectual exercise and you could say
you can even go into the realms of pants

2666
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:05,920
you can even go into the realms of pants

01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:38,680
you just convinced me what made me feel
 

2689
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:41,730
you just convinced me what made me feel
like an oil drop is a living certainly

2690
01:01:41,730 --> 01:01:41,740
like an oil drop is a living certainly

01:01:55,109 --> 01:01:55,119
difference between that and something
 

2701
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:56,520
difference between that and something
that we traditionally think of as a

2702
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:56,530
that we traditionally think of as a
 

2703
01:01:56,530 --> 01:02:01,620
that we traditionally think of as a
living system that it could die or you

2704
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:01,630
living system that it could die or you

01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:04,420
can't I mean a yab mortality I'm not I'm
 

2707

can't I mean a yab mortality I'm not I'm
not exactly sure I'm not sure what the

2708
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:06,099
not exactly sure I'm not sure what the
 

2709
01:02:06,099 --> 01:02:09,240
not exactly sure I'm not sure what the
right answer there is because they can

2710
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:09,250
right answer there is because they can
 

2711
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:10,890
right answer there is because they can
move them like movement seems like an

01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:10,900
move them like movement seems like an
 

2713
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:12,660
move them like movement seems like an

01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:14,380
in the environment but the oil drop is
 

2717
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:18,599
in the environment but the oil drop is
doing that so I don't know easy the mall

01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:18,609
doing that so I don't know easy the mall
 

2719
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:20,579
doing that so I don't know easy the mall
drop will be moved but does it inner of

2720
01:02:20,579 --> 01:02:20,589
drop will be moved but does it inner of
 

2721
01:02:20,589 --> 01:02:24,150
drop will be moved but does it inner of

2733
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:40,770

2735
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:42,059
the top of a glass sure I guess what I'm
trying to say is you're absolutely right

2736
01:02:42,059 --> 01:02:42,069
trying to say is you're absolutely right
 

2737
01:02:42,069 --> 01:02:44,549
trying to say is you're absolutely right
you hear you've even nailed it its

2738
01:02:44,549 --> 01:02:44,559
you hear you've even nailed it its
 

2739
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:46,380
you hear you've even nailed it its
movement yeah so where does that

2740
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:46,390
movement yeah so where does that
 

2741
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:47,730
movement yeah so where does that
movement come from if it comes from the

2742
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:47,740
movement come from if it comes from the
 

2743
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:50,520
movement come from if it comes from the
inside then then you've got I think

2744
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:50,530
inside then then you've got I think
 

2745
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:53,760
inside then then you've got I think
something that's living what do you mean

2746
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:53,770
something that's living what do you mean
 

2747
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,480
something that's living what do you mean
from the inside what I mean is that the

2748
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:56,490
from the inside what I mean is that the
 

2749
01:02:56,490 --> 01:02:59,670
from the inside what I mean is that the
internal States the can influence

2750
01:02:59,670 --> 01:02:59,680
internal States the can influence
 

2751
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,650
internal States the can influence
reactive states that where the actor

2752
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:01,660
reactive states that where the actor
 

2753
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:02,970
reactive states that where the actor
states can influence but they're not

2754
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:02,980
states can influence but they're not
 

2755
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:05,400
states can influence but they're not
influenced by the external states can

2756
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:05,410
influenced by the external states can
 

2757
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:07,410
influenced by the external states can
cause movement so

2758
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:07,420
cause movement so
 

2759
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:09,630
cause movement so
there are two types of oil drops if you

2760
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:09,640
there are two types of oil drops if you
 

2761
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,700
there are two types of oil drops if you
like there are oil drops where the

2762
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:11,710
like there are oil drops where the
 

2763
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:18,329
like there are oil drops where the
internal states are so random that they

2764
01:03:18,329 --> 01:03:18,339
internal states are so random that they
 

2765
01:03:18,339 --> 01:03:20,970
internal states are so random that they
average themselves away and the thing

2766
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:20,980
average themselves away and the thing
 

2767
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:24,120
average themselves away and the thing
cannot on a balance on average when you

2768
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:24,130
cannot on a balance on average when you
 

2769
01:03:24,130 --> 01:03:26,789
cannot on a balance on average when you
do the averaging move so a nice example

2770
01:03:26,789 --> 01:03:26,799
do the averaging move so a nice example
 

2771
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:30,240
do the averaging move so a nice example
of that will be the Sun the Sun Sony has

2772
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:30,250
of that will be the Sun the Sun Sony has
 

2773
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:32,220
of that will be the Sun the Sun Sony has
internal States and lots of intrinsic

2783
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:44,730
hierarchical structure and the brain
does there is no overall mode or pattern

2784
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:44,740
does there is no overall mode or pattern
 

2785
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:47,160
does there is no overall mode or pattern
or organization that expresses itself on

01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:47,170
or organization that expresses itself on
 

2787
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:49,289
or organization that expresses itself on
the surface that allows it to actually

01:03:49,289 --> 01:03:49,299
the surface that allows it to actually
 

2789
01:03:49,299 --> 01:03:52,710
the surface that allows it to actually
swim it it can certainly have you're a

2790
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:52,720
swim it it can certainly have you're a
 

2791
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:55,500
swim it it can certainly have you're a
very active surface but on mass at the

2792
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:55,510
very active surface but on mass at the
 

2793
01:03:55,510 --> 01:03:57,930
very active surface but on mass at the
scale of the actual surface of the Sun

01:03:57,930 --> 01:03:57,940
scale of the actual surface of the Sun
 

2795
01:03:57,940 --> 01:04:00,390
scale of the actual surface of the Sun
the average position of that surface

2796
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:00,400
the average position of that surface
 

2797
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,660
the average position of that surface
cannot in itself move because the

2798
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:03,670
cannot in itself move because the
 

2799
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:06,270
cannot in itself move because the
internal dynamics are more like a hot

2800
01:04:06,270 --> 01:04:06,280
internal dynamics are more like a hot
 

2801
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,799
internal dynamics are more like a hot
gas they are literally like a hot gas

2802
01:04:07,799 --> 01:04:07,809
gas they are literally like a hot gas
 

2803
01:04:07,809 --> 01:04:10,559
gas they are literally like a hot gas
whereas your internal dynamics are much

2804
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:10,569
whereas your internal dynamics are much
 

2805
01:04:10,569 --> 01:04:12,359
whereas your internal dynamics are much
more structured and deeply structured

2806
01:04:12,359 --> 01:04:12,369
more structured and deeply structured
 

2807
01:04:12,369 --> 01:04:15,390
more structured and deeply structured
and now you can express on your mark of

that's all you can do and that's

that's all you can do and that's
 

2819
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,770
that's all you can do and that's
something which you know if you haven't

01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:30,309
thought of it like this before
 

2823
01:04:30,309 --> 01:04:32,670
thought of it like this before
I think it's nice just realize there is

2824
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:32,680
I think it's nice just realize there is
 

2825
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:36,030
I think it's nice just realize there is
no other way that you can change the

no other way that you can change the

01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,430
no other way that you can change the

change the universe it's moving and in

01:04:57,420 --> 01:04:57,430
the fact that you do so non randomly it
 

2841
01:04:57,430 --> 01:04:59,819
the fact that you do so non randomly it
makes you alive yeah so it's not

01:08:58,060 --> 01:08:59,789
we how can we start to think about
consciousness within this framework is

3014

consciousness within this framework is
 

3015
01:08:59,799 --> 01:09:02,490
consciousness within this framework is
it possible yeah I think it's possible

3016
01:09:02,490 --> 01:09:02,500
it possible yeah I think it's possible
 

3017
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:06,740
it possible yeah I think it's possible
to think about it whether you'll get

a definitive answer that but certainly

there's a lot of interest in using not

but you wouldn't endow it with the

not quite as unconscious as a virus it
 

3065
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:26,260
not quite as unconscious as a virus it
certainly seems to have a purpose it

3074
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:40,670
virus so there's something about so
 

3075
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:43,270
virus so there's something about so
there's some line that has to do with

there's some line that has to do with
 

3077
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:46,450
there's some line that has to do with
the complexity of planning yes that may

3078
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:46,460
the complexity of planning yes that may
 

3079
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:48,310
the complexity of planning yes that may
contain an answer I mean it'd be

3080
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:48,320
contain an answer I mean it'd be
 

3081
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,890
contain an answer I mean it'd be
beautiful if if we can find a line

3082
01:10:50,890 --> 01:10:50,900
beautiful if if we can find a line

cautious yes it would be these are

3086
01:10:56,830 --> 01:10:56,840
cautious yes it would be these are
 

3087
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,380
cautious yes it would be these are
wonderful lines that we've drawn with

3088
01:10:59,380 --> 01:10:59,390
wonderful lines that we've drawn with
 

3089
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:03,970
wonderful lines that we've drawn with
existence life and consciousness yes it

3090
01:11:03,970 --> 01:11:03,980
existence life and consciousness yes it
 

3091
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:05,980
existence life and consciousness yes it
will be very nice what one little

3092
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:05,990
will be very nice what one little
 

3093
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:07,900
will be very nice what one little
wrinkle there and this is something I've

3094
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:07,910
wrinkle there and this is something I've
 

3095
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:09,430
wrinkle there and this is something I've
only learned in the past few months is

3096
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:09,440
only learned in the past few months is
 

3097
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:10,960
only learned in the past few months is
the notion the philosophical notion of

3098
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:10,970
the notion the philosophical notion of
 

3099
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:13,690
the notion the philosophical notion of
vagueness so you're saying it would be

3100
01:11:13,690 --> 01:11:13,700
vagueness so you're saying it would be
 

3101
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:15,640
vagueness so you're saying it would be
wonderful to draw a line and I had

3102
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:15,650
wonderful to draw a line and I had
 

3103
01:11:15,650 --> 01:11:17,740
wonderful to draw a line and I had
always assumed that that line at some

3104
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:17,750
always assumed that that line at some
 

3105
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:19,899
always assumed that that line at some
point would be drawn and

3106
01:11:19,899 --> 01:11:19,909
point would be drawn and
 

3107
01:11:19,909 --> 01:11:22,899
point would be drawn and
until about four months ago and the

3108
01:11:22,899 --> 01:11:22,909
until about four months ago and the
 

3109
01:11:22,909 --> 01:11:25,000
until about four months ago and the
philosopher told me about vagueness so I

3110
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:25,010
philosopher told me about vagueness so I
 

3111
01:11:25,010 --> 01:11:26,799
philosopher told me about vagueness so I
know if you've come across this but it's

3112
01:11:26,799 --> 01:11:26,809
know if you've come across this but it's
 

3113
01:11:26,809 --> 01:11:30,029
know if you've come across this but it's
a technical concept and I think most

3114
01:11:30,029 --> 01:11:30,039
a technical concept and I think most
 

3115
01:11:30,039 --> 01:11:33,759
a technical concept and I think most
revealingly illustrated with at what

3116
01:11:33,759 --> 01:11:33,769
revealingly illustrated with at what
 

3117
01:11:33,769 --> 01:11:36,060
revealingly illustrated with at what
point does a pile of sand become a pile

3118
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:36,070
point does a pile of sand become a pile
 

3119
01:11:36,070 --> 01:11:39,850
point does a pile of sand become a pile
is it one grain two grains three grains

3120
01:11:39,850 --> 01:11:39,860
is it one grain two grains three grains
 

3121
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:43,000
is it one grain two grains three grains
or four grains so at what point would

3122
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:43,010
or four grains so at what point would
 

3123
01:11:43,010 --> 01:11:45,399
or four grains so at what point would
you draw the line between being a pile

3124
01:11:45,399 --> 01:11:45,409
you draw the line between being a pile
 

3125
01:11:45,409 --> 01:11:49,689
you draw the line between being a pile
of sand and a collection of some of the

3126
01:11:49,689 --> 01:11:49,699
of sand and a collection of some of the
 

3127
01:11:49,699 --> 01:11:52,330
of sand and a collection of some of the
grains of sand in the same way is it

3128
01:11:52,330 --> 01:11:52,340
grains of sand in the same way is it
 

3129
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:54,640
grains of sand in the same way is it
right to ask where would I draw the line

3130
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:54,650
right to ask where would I draw the line
 

3131
01:11:54,650 --> 01:11:57,159
right to ask where would I draw the line
between conscious and unconscious and it

3132
01:11:57,159 --> 01:11:57,169
between conscious and unconscious and it
 

3133
01:11:57,169 --> 01:12:00,100
between conscious and unconscious and it
might be a vague concept having said

01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:00,110

I don't think it gets you quite as far

01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:32,410
I don't think it gets you quite as far

as self aware though I think you and
 

3251
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:36,910
as self aware though I think you and
then your you have to I think grapple

3252
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:36,920
then your you have to I think grapple

01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:45,100
write down a calculus or a maths of

01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:45,110
self-awareness I don't think it's
 

3259
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:49,870
self-awareness I don't think it's
impossible to do but I think you would

3260
01:14:49,870 --> 01:14:49,880
impossible to do but I think you would
 

3261
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:51,940
impossible to do but I think you would
know we pressure on you to actually

01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:51,950
know we pressure on you to actually
 

3263
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:53,530
know we pressure on you to actually
commit to a formal definition or a mean

3264
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:53,540
commit to a formal definition or a mean
 

3265
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:57,490
commit to a formal definition or a mean
by self awareness I think most people

3266
01:14:57,490 --> 01:14:57,500
by self awareness I think most people
 

3267
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:00,820
by self awareness I think most people
that I know would probably say that a

3268
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:00,830
that I know would probably say that a
 

3269
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:06,120
that I know would probably say that a
goldfish no pet fish was not self-aware

3270
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:06,130
goldfish no pet fish was not self-aware
 

3271
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:08,380
goldfish no pet fish was not self-aware
they would probably argue about their

3272
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:08,390
they would probably argue about their
 

3273
01:15:08,390 --> 01:15:10,320
they would probably argue about their
favourite cat

3274
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:10,330
favourite cat
 

3275
01:15:10,330 --> 01:15:12,180
favourite cat
but would be quite happy to say that

3276
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:12,190
but would be quite happy to say that
 

3277
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:15,780
but would be quite happy to say that
that mom was self-aware so I mean but

3278
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:15,790
that mom was self-aware so I mean but
 

3279
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:18,060
that mom was self-aware so I mean but
that might very well connect to some

3280
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:18,070
that might very well connect to some
 

3281
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:20,970
that might very well connect to some
level of complexity with planning it

3282
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:20,980
level of complexity with planning it
 

3283
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:23,490
level of complexity with planning it
seems like self-awareness is essential

3284
01:15:23,490 --> 01:15:23,500
seems like self-awareness is essential
 

3285
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:27,510
seems like self-awareness is essential
for complex planning yeah do you want to

3286
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:27,520
for complex planning yeah do you want to
 

3287
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:28,440
for complex planning yeah do you want to
talk about further coffee you're

3288
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:28,450
talk about further coffee you're
 

3289
01:15:28,450 --> 01:15:30,270
talk about further coffee you're
absolutely right again the line is

3290
01:15:30,270 --> 01:15:30,280
absolutely right again the line is
 

3291
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:33,060
absolutely right again the line is
unclear but it seems like integrating

3292
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:33,070
unclear but it seems like integrating
 

3293
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:37,560
unclear but it seems like integrating
yourself into the world into Europe into

3294
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:37,570
yourself into the world into Europe into
 

3295
01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:40,160
yourself into the world into Europe into
your planning is essential for

3296
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:40,170
your planning is essential for
 

3297
01:15:40,170 --> 01:15:43,560
your planning is essential for
constructing complex plans yes yeah

3298
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:43,570
constructing complex plans yes yeah
 

3299
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:45,780
constructing complex plans yes yeah
so I'm mathematically describing that in

3300
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:45,790
so I'm mathematically describing that in
 

3301
01:15:45,790 --> 01:15:48,780
so I'm mathematically describing that in
the same elegant way as you have the

3302
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:48,790
the same elegant way as you have the
 

3303
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:51,090
the same elegant way as you have the
free energy principle might be difficult

3304
01:15:51,090 --> 01:15:51,100
free energy principle might be difficult
 

3305
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:54,240
free energy principle might be difficult
well yes and no I don't think that well

3306
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:54,250
well yes and no I don't think that well
 

3307
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:55,860
well yes and no I don't think that well
perhaps we should just can we just go

3308
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:55,870
perhaps we should just can we just go
 

3309
01:15:55,870 --> 01:15:58,320
perhaps we should just can we just go
back that's a very important answer you

3310
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:58,330
back that's a very important answer you
 

3311
01:15:58,330 --> 01:16:00,990
back that's a very important answer you
gave like I think if I just unpacked it

3312
01:16:00,990 --> 01:16:01,000
gave like I think if I just unpacked it
 

3313
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,330
gave like I think if I just unpacked it
you know you'd see the truisms or you've

3314
01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:03,340
you know you'd see the truisms or you've
 

3315
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:06,630
you know you'd see the truisms or you've
just you've just exposed France but

3316
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:06,640
just you've just exposed France but
 

3317
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:09,900
just you've just exposed France but
maybe so yeah I I'm mindful that I

3318
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:09,910
maybe so yeah I I'm mindful that I
 

3319
01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:11,460
maybe so yeah I I'm mindful that I
didn't answer your question before well

3320
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:11,470
didn't answer your question before well
 

3321
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:13,320
didn't answer your question before well
yeah what's the pre hundred principle

3322
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:13,330
yeah what's the pre hundred principle
 

3323
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:14,820
yeah what's the pre hundred principle

but it would it be easier and be hard
 

3483
01:19:34,130 --> 01:19:36,820
but it would it be easier and be hard
well mathematically is easy I've just

3484
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:36,830
well mathematically is easy I've just
 

3485
01:19:36,830 --> 01:19:37,869
well mathematically is easy I've just
told you all you

3486
01:19:37,869 --> 01:19:37,879
told you all you
 

3487
01:19:37,879 --> 01:19:43,439
told you all you
right down your your perfect artifact

3488
01:19:43,439 --> 01:19:43,449
right down your your perfect artifact

consequences of the world in which this
 

3497
01:19:52,939 --> 01:19:55,330
consequences of the world in which this
thing is immersed and then you just

3498
01:19:55,330 --> 01:19:55,340
thing is immersed and then you just
 

3499
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:58,209
thing is immersed and then you just
engineer a computer and a robot to

3500
01:19:58,209 --> 01:19:58,219
engineer a computer and a robot to
 

3501
01:19:58,219 --> 01:19:59,770
engineer a computer and a robot to
perform a gradient descent on that

3502
01:19:59,770 --> 01:19:59,780
perform a gradient descent on that
 

3503
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:02,949
perform a gradient descent on that
objective function no problem but of

3504
01:20:02,949 --> 01:20:02,959
objective function no problem but of
 

3505
01:20:02,959 --> 01:20:04,689
objective function no problem but of
course the big problem is writing down

3506
01:20:04,689 --> 01:20:04,699
course the big problem is writing down
 

3507
01:20:04,699 --> 01:20:06,609
course the big problem is writing down
the generative model so that's where the

3508
01:20:06,609 --> 01:20:06,619
the generative model so that's where the
 

3509
01:20:06,619 --> 01:20:08,679
the generative model so that's where the
heavy lifting comes in yeah so it's it's

3510
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:08,689
heavy lifting comes in yeah so it's it's
 

3511
01:20:08,689 --> 01:20:10,569
heavy lifting comes in yeah so it's it's
the form and the structure of that

3512
01:20:10,569 --> 01:20:10,579
the form and the structure of that
 

3513
01:20:10,579 --> 01:20:12,839
the form and the structure of that
journal team model which basically

3514
01:20:12,839 --> 01:20:12,849
journal team model which basically
 

3515
01:20:12,849 --> 01:20:14,979
journal team model which basically
defines the artifact that you will

3516
01:20:14,979 --> 01:20:14,989
defines the artifact that you will
 

3517
01:20:14,989 --> 01:20:17,830
defines the artifact that you will
create or indeed the kind of artifact

3518
01:20:17,830 --> 01:20:17,840
create or indeed the kind of artifact
 

3519
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:20,409
create or indeed the kind of artifact
that has self-awareness so that's where

3520
01:20:20,409 --> 01:20:20,419
that has self-awareness so that's where
 

3521
01:20:20,419 --> 01:20:22,750
that has self-awareness so that's where
all the hard work comes very much like

3522
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:22,760
all the hard work comes very much like
 

3523
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:24,759
all the hard work comes very much like
natural selection doesn't tell you in

3524
01:20:24,759 --> 01:20:24,769
natural selection doesn't tell you in
 

3525
01:20:24,769 --> 01:20:27,219
natural selection doesn't tell you in
the slightest why you have eyes so you

3526
01:20:27,219 --> 01:20:27,229
the slightest why you have eyes so you
 

3527
01:20:27,229 --> 01:20:29,290
the slightest why you have eyes so you
have to drill down on the actual feeding

3528
01:20:29,290 --> 01:20:29,300
have to drill down on the actual feeding
 

3529
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:32,409
have to drill down on the actual feeding
time the actual giant ear model so with

time the actual giant ear model so with
 

3531
01:20:32,419 --> 01:20:36,580
time the actual giant ear model so with
that in mind what did you tell me that

3532
01:20:36,580 --> 01:20:36,590
that in mind what did you tell me that
 

3533
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:39,189
that in mind what did you tell me that
tells me immediately the kinds of

3534
01:20:39,189 --> 01:20:39,199
tells me immediately the kinds of
 

3535
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:41,409
tells me immediately the kinds of
journey models I would have to write

3536
01:20:41,409 --> 01:20:41,419
journey models I would have to write
 

3537
01:20:41,419 --> 01:20:42,629
journey models I would have to write
down in order to have self-awareness

3538
01:20:42,629 --> 01:20:42,639
down in order to have self-awareness
 

3539
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:47,229
down in order to have self-awareness
what you said to me was I have to have a

3540
01:20:47,229 --> 01:20:47,239
what you said to me was I have to have a
 

3541
01:20:47,239 --> 01:20:49,989
what you said to me was I have to have a
model that is effectively fit for

3542
01:20:49,989 --> 01:20:49,999
model that is effectively fit for
 

3543
01:20:49,999 --> 01:20:52,029
model that is effectively fit for
purpose for this kind of world in which

3544
01:20:52,029 --> 01:20:52,039
purpose for this kind of world in which
 

3545
01:20:52,039 --> 01:20:55,149
purpose for this kind of world in which
I operate and if I now make the

3546
01:20:55,149 --> 01:20:55,159
I operate and if I now make the
 

3547
01:20:55,159 --> 01:20:57,219
I operate and if I now make the
observation that this kind of world is

3548
01:20:57,219 --> 01:20:57,229
observation that this kind of world is
 

3549
01:20:57,229 --> 01:20:59,439
observation that this kind of world is
effectively largely populated by other

3550
01:20:59,439 --> 01:20:59,449
effectively largely populated by other
 

3551
01:20:59,449 --> 01:21:02,919
effectively largely populated by other
things like me ie you then it makes

3552
01:21:02,919 --> 01:21:02,929
things like me ie you then it makes
 

3553
01:21:02,929 --> 01:21:05,819
things like me ie you then it makes
enormous sense that if I can develop a

3554
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:05,829
enormous sense that if I can develop a
 

3555
01:21:05,829 --> 01:21:10,209
enormous sense that if I can develop a
hypothesis that we are similar kinds of

3556
01:21:10,209 --> 01:21:10,219
hypothesis that we are similar kinds of
 

3557
01:21:10,219 --> 01:21:12,580
hypothesis that we are similar kinds of
creatures this is in fact the same kind

3558
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:12,590
creatures this is in fact the same kind
 

3559
01:21:12,590 --> 01:21:13,149
creatures this is in fact the same kind
of creature

3560
01:21:13,149 --> 01:21:13,159
of creature
 

3561
01:21:13,159 --> 01:21:16,810
of creature
but I am me and you are you then it

3562
01:21:16,810 --> 01:21:16,820
but I am me and you are you then it
 

3563
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:20,319
but I am me and you are you then it
becomes again mandated to have a sense

3564
01:21:20,319 --> 01:21:20,329
becomes again mandated to have a sense
 

3565
01:21:20,329 --> 01:21:24,029
becomes again mandated to have a sense
of self so if I live in a world that is

3566
01:21:24,029 --> 01:21:24,039
of self so if I live in a world that is
 

3567
01:21:24,039 --> 01:21:27,009
of self so if I live in a world that is
constituted by things like me basically

3568
01:21:27,009 --> 01:21:27,019
constituted by things like me basically
 

3569
01:21:27,019 --> 01:21:29,889
constituted by things like me basically
a social world a community then it

3570
01:21:29,889 --> 01:21:29,899
a social world a community then it
 

3571
01:21:29,899 --> 01:21:32,020
a social world a community then it
becomes necessary now for me to him

3572
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:32,030
becomes necessary now for me to him
 

3573
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:33,609
becomes necessary now for me to him
further it's me talking and not you

3574
01:21:33,609 --> 01:21:33,619
further it's me talking and not you
 

3575
01:21:33,619 --> 01:21:35,439
further it's me talking and not you
talking I wouldn't need that if is on

3576
01:21:35,439 --> 01:21:35,449
talking I wouldn't need that if is on
 

3577
01:21:35,449 --> 01:21:38,560
talking I wouldn't need that if is on
Mars by myself or if I was in the jungle

3578
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:38,570
Mars by myself or if I was in the jungle
 

3579
01:21:38,570 --> 01:21:40,810
Mars by myself or if I was in the jungle
as a feral child if there was nothing

3580
01:21:40,810 --> 01:21:40,820
as a feral child if there was nothing
 

3581
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:42,609
as a feral child if there was nothing
like it if there's nothing like me

3582
01:21:42,609 --> 01:21:42,619
like it if there's nothing like me
 

3583
01:21:42,619 --> 01:21:45,089
like it if there's nothing like me
around there would be no need to have a

3584
01:21:45,089 --> 01:21:45,099
around there would be no need to have a
 

3585
01:21:45,099 --> 01:21:48,030
around there would be no need to have a
an inference that our hypotheses are yes

3586
01:21:48,030 --> 01:21:48,040
an inference that our hypotheses are yes
 

3587
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:50,669
an inference that our hypotheses are yes
it is me that is experiencing or causing

3588
01:21:50,669 --> 01:21:50,679
it is me that is experiencing or causing
 

3589
01:21:50,679 --> 01:21:52,620
it is me that is experiencing or causing
these sounds and it is not you it's only

3590
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:52,630
these sounds and it is not you it's only
 

3591
01:21:52,630 --> 01:21:55,140
these sounds and it is not you it's only
when there's ambiguity and play induced

3592
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:55,150
when there's ambiguity and play induced
 

3593
01:21:55,150 --> 01:21:56,490
when there's ambiguity and play induced
by the fact that there are others in

3594
01:21:56,490 --> 01:21:56,500
by the fact that there are others in
 

3595
01:21:56,500 --> 01:22:00,390
by the fact that there are others in
that world so I think then the special

3596
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:00,400
that world so I think then the special
 

3597
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:03,899
that world so I think then the special
thing about self-aware artifacts is that

3598
01:22:03,899 --> 01:22:03,909
thing about self-aware artifacts is that
 

3599
01:22:03,909 --> 01:22:06,870
thing about self-aware artifacts is that
they have learned to or they have

3600
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:06,880
they have learned to or they have
 

3601
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,290
they have learned to or they have
acquired or at least are equipped with

01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:15,130
that allow for the fad there are lots of
 

3607
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:17,490
that allow for the fad there are lots of

therefore they have to work out it's you

therefore they have to work out it's you

01:22:33,790 --> 01:22:36,359
or self-awareness in the context of
planning existing in the world is so you

3622
01:22:36,359 --> 01:22:36,369
planning existing in the world is so you
 

3623
01:22:36,369 --> 01:22:38,010
planning existing in the world is so you
can operate with other things like you

3624
01:22:38,010 --> 01:22:38,020
can operate with other things like you
 

3625
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:39,810
can operate with other things like you
and like you couldn't it doesn't have to

3626
01:22:39,810 --> 01:22:39,820
and like you couldn't it doesn't have to
 

3627
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:41,189
and like you couldn't it doesn't have to
necessarily be human it could be other

humanoid and I think there's a your deep

3638
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:51,010
humanoid and I think there's a your deep
 

3639
01:22:51,010 --> 01:22:52,560
humanoid and I think there's a your deep
reason for that but it's this much

3640
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:52,570
reason for that but it's this much
 

3641
01:22:52,570 --> 01:22:55,140
reason for that but it's this much
easier to read the world if you can make

3642
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:55,150
easier to read the world if you can make
 

3643
01:22:55,150 --> 01:22:56,220
easier to read the world if you can make
the simplifying assumption that

3644
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:56,230
the simplifying assumption that
 

3645
01:22:56,230 --> 01:22:58,350
the simplifying assumption that
basically you're me and it's just your

3646
01:22:58,350 --> 01:22:58,360
basically you're me and it's just your
 

3647
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:00,870
basically you're me and it's just your
turn to talk and I mean when we talk

3648
01:23:00,870 --> 01:23:00,880
turn to talk and I mean when we talk
 

3649
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:01,979
turn to talk and I mean when we talk
about planning when you talk

3650
01:23:01,979 --> 01:23:01,989
about planning when you talk
 

3651
01:23:01,989 --> 01:23:04,399
about planning when you talk
specifically about planning the

3652
01:23:04,399 --> 01:23:04,409
specifically about planning the
 

3653
01:23:04,409 --> 01:23:07,740
specifically about planning the
highest.if manifestation or realization

3654
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:07,750
highest.if manifestation or realization
 

3655
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:09,030
highest.if manifestation or realization
of that planning is what we're doing now

3656
01:23:09,030 --> 01:23:09,040
of that planning is what we're doing now
 

3657
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:11,430
of that planning is what we're doing now
I mean the human condition doesn't get

3658
01:23:11,430 --> 01:23:11,440
I mean the human condition doesn't get
 

3659
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:14,120
I mean the human condition doesn't get
any higher than this talking about the

any higher than this talking about the
 

3661
01:23:14,130 --> 01:23:16,879
any higher than this talking about the
philosophy of existence and the

3662

I'll really listen to this conversation
many times uh there's so much poetry in

01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:23,370
this and mathematics let me ask the
 

3719
01:24:23,370 --> 01:24:25,130
this and mathematics let me ask the
silliest or perhaps the biggest question

silliest or perhaps the biggest question
 

3721
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:29,990
silliest or perhaps the biggest question

as the last kind of question we've
talked about living in existence and an

we get a really interesting conversation
about what that comprises in terms of

about what that comprises in terms of
