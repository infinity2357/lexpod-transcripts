if their senses are even attuned to

112
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:12,480
if their senses are even attuned to
 

113
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,070
if their senses are even attuned to
similar stuff to what our senses are

114
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,080
similar stuff to what our senses are
 

115
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,430
similar stuff to what our senses are

and so let's assume that they're kind of

120
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:20,480
and so let's assume that they're kind of
 

121
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,990
and so let's assume that they're kind of
like us just technologically more

122
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
like us just technologically more
 

123

advanced to get here from wherever they
 

125
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,070
advanced to get here from wherever they
are that's the first kind of constraint

126
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:25,080
are that's the first kind of constraint
 

127
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,229
are that's the first kind of constraint

experiment and then if they've watched

130
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,000
experiment and then if they've watched
 

131
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,830
experiment and then if they've watched
throughout all of history

132
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:30,840
throughout all of history
 

133
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,830
throughout all of history
they saw the burning of Alexandria they

134
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:32,840
they saw the burning of Alexandria they
 

135
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,589
they saw the burning of Alexandria they
saw that 2,000 years ago in Greece we

136
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:36,599
saw that 2,000 years ago in Greece we
 

137
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,110
saw that 2,000 years ago in Greece we
were producing things like clocks the

138
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:38,120
were producing things like clocks the
 

139
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,710
were producing things like clocks the
anti-ia mechanism and then that

140
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:39,720
anti-ia mechanism and then that
 

141
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,070
anti-ia mechanism and then that
technology got lost they saw that there

142
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
technology got lost they saw that there
 

143
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,390
technology got lost they saw that there
wasn't just a steady dialectic of

144
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
wasn't just a steady dialectic of
 

145
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,149
wasn't just a steady dialectic of
progress so every once in a while

146
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:46,159
progress so every once in a while
 

147
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:48,589
progress so every once in a while
there's a giant fire that destroys a lot

148
00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:48,599
there's a giant fire that destroys a lot
 

149
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,910
there's a giant fire that destroys a lot
of things there's a giant like uh

150
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:51,920
of things there's a giant like uh
 

151
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,350
of things there's a giant like uh
commotion that destroys a lot of things

152
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:54,360
commotion that destroys a lot of things
 

153
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,110
commotion that destroys a lot of things
yeah and it's usually

154
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,120
yeah and it's usually
 

155
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,190
yeah and it's usually
self-induced uh they would have seen

156
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,200
self-induced uh they would have seen
 

157
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,710
self-induced uh they would have seen
seen that

158
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:00,720
seen that
 

159
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,910
seen that
and so as they're looking at us now as

160
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:03,920
and so as they're looking at us now as
 

161
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,990
and so as they're looking at us now as
we move past the nuclear weapons age

162
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,000
we move past the nuclear weapons age
 

163
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,309
we move past the nuclear weapons age

that that's
 

327
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,950
that that's
um that's us humans being hopeful and

be it really could be something truly
 

339
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:49,990
be it really could be something truly
exciting that a science

340
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,000
exciting that a science
 

341
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,550
exciting that a science
should turn its eye towards so what do

342
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:54,560
should turn its eye towards so what do
 

343
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,469
should turn its eye towards so what do
where do you place it speaking of

344
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:56,479
where do you place it speaking of
 

345
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,629
where do you place it speaking of
turning eye towards this is one of those

346
00:06:58,629 --> 00:06:58,639
turning eye towards this is one of those
 

347
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,029
turning eye towards this is one of those
super fascinating ating actually super

00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:03,440
consequential possibly topics that I
 

351
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,430
consequential possibly topics that I
wish I had more time to study and just

352
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,440
wish I had more time to study and just
 

353
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,589
wish I had more time to study and just
haven't allocated so I I don't have firm

00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:07,599
haven't allocated so I I don't have firm
 

355
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:08,629
haven't allocated so I I don't have firm
beliefs on this because I haven't got to

00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:08,639
beliefs on this because I haven't got to
 

357
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,029
beliefs on this because I haven't got to
study it as much as I want so what I'm

358
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:10,039
study it as much as I want so what I'm
 

359
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:13,189
study it as much as I want so what I'm
going to say comes from a superficial

going to say comes from a superficial
 

361
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,270
going to say comes from a superficial
assessment um while we know there are

00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:16,280
assessment um while we know there are
 

363
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,189
assessment um while we know there are
plenty of things that people thought of

00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:19,199
plenty of things that people thought of
 

365
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,189
plenty of things that people thought of
as UFO sightings that we can fully write

366
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:21,199
as UFO sightings that we can fully write
 

367
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,950
as UFO sightings that we can fully write
off we have other better explanations

368
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:22,960
off we have other better explanations
 

369
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,230
off we have other better explanations
for them uh what we're interested in is

370
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:25,240
for them uh what we're interested in is
 

371
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,270
for them uh what we're interested in is
the ones that we don't have better

00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:26,280
the ones that we don't have better
 

373
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,670
the ones that we don't have better
explanations for and then not just

374
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
explanations for and then not just
 

375
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,990
explanations for and then not just
immediately jumping to uh a theory of

00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:31,000
immediately jumping to uh a theory of
 

377
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,469
immediately jumping to uh a theory of
what it is but holding it as

378
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:32,479
what it is but holding it as
 

379
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,710
what it is but holding it as
unidentified and being being um curious

and
 

383
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,029
and
Earnest I think the the uh Tic Tac one

384
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:39,039
Earnest I think the the uh Tic Tac one
 

385
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,830
Earnest I think the the uh Tic Tac one
is quite interesting and made it in

386
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:40,840
is quite interesting and made it in
 

387
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,309
is quite interesting and made it in
major media recently but I don't know if

388
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:43,319
major media recently but I don't know if
 

389
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:46,670

you ever saw the disclosure project uh

390
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:46,680
you ever saw the disclosure project uh
 

391
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,510
you ever saw the disclosure project uh
guy named Steven Greer organized a bunch

392
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:49,520
guy named Steven Greer organized a bunch
 

393
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,149

00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:56,440
commercial flight uh people who had
 

397
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,149
commercial flight uh people who had
Direct observation and classified

398
00:07:58,149 --> 00:07:58,159
Direct observation and classified

information uh disclosing it at a CNN
 

401
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,469
information uh disclosing it at a CNN
briefing and so you saw high-ranking

402
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:04,479
briefing and so you saw high-ranking
 

403
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,469

describing things that they saw um on

406
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:09,360
describing things that they saw um on
 

407
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,110
describing things that they saw um on
radar with visual uh with their own eyes

408
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,120
radar with visual uh with their own eyes
 

409
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,909
radar with visual uh with their own eyes
or cameras and also describing some

410
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:16,919
or cameras and also describing some
 

411
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,589
or cameras and also describing some
phenomena that had some consistency

412
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:18,599
phenomena that had some consistency
 

413
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:22,309
phenomena that had some consistency
across different people and I find this

414
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:22,319
across different people and I find this
 

415
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,869
across different people and I find this
interesting enough that I think it would

416
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:23,879
interesting enough that I think it would
 

417
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,550
interesting enough that I think it would
be silly to just dismiss

418
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:25,560
be silly to just dismiss
 

419
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,790
be silly to just dismiss
it um and specifically like we can we

420
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:28,800
it um and specifically like we can we
 

421
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,990
it um and specifically like we can we
can ask the question how much of it is

422
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:31,000
can ask the question how much of it is
 

423
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,509
can ask the question how much of it is
natural phenomena ball lightning or

424
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:32,519
natural phenomena ball lightning or
 

425
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,949
natural phenomena ball lightning or
something like that and this is why I'm

426
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:34,959
something like that and this is why I'm
 

427
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:37,709
something like that and this is why I'm
more interested in what uh fighter

428
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:37,719
more interested in what uh fighter
 

429
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:39,469
more interested in what uh fighter
pilots and astronauts and people who are

430
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:39,479
pilots and astronauts and people who are
 

431
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,790
pilots and astronauts and people who are
trained in

432
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:41,800
trained in
 

433
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,670
trained in
um being able to identify uh flying

434
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680
um being able to identify uh flying
 

435
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,710
um being able to identify uh flying
objects and um atmospheric phenomena um

436
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
objects and um atmospheric phenomena um
 

437
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,509
objects and um atmospheric phenomena um
have to say about

438
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:50,519
have to say about
 

439
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:53,269
have to say about
it I think the thing then you you could

440
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:53,279
it I think the thing then you you could
 

441
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,990
it I think the thing then you you could
say well are they more advanced military

442
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,000
say well are they more advanced military
 

443
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,190
say well are they more advanced military
Craft um is it some kind of you know

444
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:58,200
Craft um is it some kind of you know
 

445
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,030
Craft um is it some kind of you know
human craft

446
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,040
human craft
 

447
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,670
human craft
the interesting thing that a number of

448
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:01,680
the interesting thing that a number of
 

449
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,470
the interesting thing that a number of
them describe is something that's kind

450
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:03,480
them describe is something that's kind
 

451
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,790
them describe is something that's kind
of like right angles at speed or if not

452
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:06,800
of like right angles at speed or if not
 

453
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,829
of like right angles at speed or if not
right angles acute angles at speed but

454
00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:08,839
right angles acute angles at speed but
 

455
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,590
right angles acute angles at speed but
something that looks like a different

456
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:10,600
something that looks like a different
 

457
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,110
something that looks like a different
relationship to inertia than physics

458
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:12,120
relationship to inertia than physics
 

459
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,670
relationship to inertia than physics
makes sense for

460
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:13,680
makes sense for
 

461
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,430
makes sense for
us I don't think that there are any

462
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:16,440
us I don't think that there are any
 

463
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,110
us I don't think that there are any
human technologies that are doing that

464
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:18,120
human technologies that are doing that
 

465
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,310
human technologies that are doing that
even in really deep uh underground black

466
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:21,320
even in really deep uh underground black
 

467
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,790
even in really deep uh underground black
projects now one could say okay well

468
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:23,800
projects now one could say okay well
 

469
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,949
projects now one could say okay well
could it be a hologram well would it

470
00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:25,959
could it be a hologram well would it
 

471
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:27,790
could it be a hologram well would it
show up on radar if radar is also seeing

472
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:27,800
show up on radar if radar is also seeing
 

473
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,750
show up on radar if radar is also seeing
it and so

474
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:29,760
it and so
 

475
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,230
it and so
uh I don't know I think there's enough I

476
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,240
uh I don't know I think there's enough I
 

477
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,550
uh I don't know I think there's enough I
mean and for that to be a massive

478
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:34,560
mean and for that to be a massive
 

479
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,470
mean and for that to be a massive
coordinated scop is it as interesting

480
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
coordinated scop is it as interesting
 

481
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,829
coordinated scop is it as interesting
and ridiculous in a way as the idea that

482
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:41,839
and ridiculous in a way as the idea that
 

483
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,910
and ridiculous in a way as the idea that
it's UFOs from some extraplanetary

484
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:44,920
it's UFOs from some extraplanetary
 

485
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,350
it's UFOs from some extraplanetary
source so it's it's up there on the

that's one way to communicate it's a
 

757
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,350
that's one way to communicate it's a

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,430
to control gravity at that scale I think
you just jumped up the kardashev scale

you just jumped up the kardashev scale

you just jumped up the kardashev scale

I would indeed ask the question the same

1012
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:01,440
I would indeed ask the question the same
 

1013
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,029
I would indeed ask the question the same
way but I would be less confident

1014
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:04,039
way but I would be less confident
 

1015
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:07,029
way but I would be less confident
about uh about your

about uh about your
 

1017
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,549
about uh about your
conclusions um it would be an actually

1018
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:09,559
conclusions um it would be an actually
 

1019
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,710
conclusions um it would be an actually
more interesting way to ask the question

1020
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:11,720
more interesting way to ask the question
 

1021
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,549
more interesting way to ask the question
at that time but I was nevertheless ask

1022
00:21:13,549 --> 00:21:13,559
at that time but I was nevertheless ask
 

1023
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:16,190
at that time but I was nevertheless ask
it the same way yes well let's go back

1024
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:16,200
it the same way yes well let's go back
 

1025
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,750
it the same way yes well let's go back
further and smaller then uh rather than

1026
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:18,760
further and smaller then uh rather than

00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:22,360
species let's look
 

1031
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:27,230
species let's look
at uh in a relatively isolated tribe yes

1032
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:27,240
at uh in a relatively isolated tribe yes
 

1033
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,190
at uh in a relatively isolated tribe yes
in the Rel atively isolated probably sub

1037
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:37,190
Dunbar number sub kind of 150 people
tribe do I look at that as one entity

1038
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:37,200
tribe do I look at that as one entity
 

1039
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,750
tribe do I look at that as one entity
where evolution is selecting for it

1040
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:38,760
where evolution is selecting for it
 

1041
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,350
where evolution is selecting for it
based on group selection or do I think

1042
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:40,360
based on group selection or do I think
 

1043
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,590
based on group selection or do I think
of it as 150 individuals um that are

1044
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:43,600
of it as 150 individuals um that are
 

1045
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,630
of it as 150 individuals um that are
interacting in some

1046
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:45,640
interacting in some
 

1047
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,230
interacting in some
way well could those individuals exist

1048
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:48,240
way well could those individuals exist
 

1049
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,870
way well could those individuals exist
without the group

1050
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:50,880
without the group
 

1051
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,070
without the group
no uh

1052
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,080
no uh
 

1053
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,230
no uh
The evolutionary adaptiveness of

1054
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:56,240
The evolutionary adaptiveness of
 

1055
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,230
The evolutionary adaptiveness of
humans was in involved critically group

1056
00:21:59,230 --> 00:21:59,240
humans was in involved critically group
 

1057
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,909
humans was in involved critically group
selection and individual humans alone

1058
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:01,919
selection and individual humans alone
 

1059
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,110
selection and individual humans alone
trying to figure out stone tools and

1060
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:04,120
trying to figure out stone tools and
 

1061
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,590
trying to figure out stone tools and
protection and whatever uh aren't what

1062
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:06,600
protection and whatever uh aren't what
 

1063
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,870
protection and whatever uh aren't what
was selected

1064
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:07,880
was selected
 

1065
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,510
was selected
for and so I think the ore is the wrong

1066
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:12,520
for and so I think the ore is the wrong
 

1067
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,950
for and so I think the ore is the wrong
frame I think

1068
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:14,960
frame I think
 

1069
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,149
frame I think
it's individuals are affecting the group

1070
00:22:19,149 --> 00:22:19,159
it's individuals are affecting the group
 

1071
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:21,149
it's individuals are affecting the group
that they're a part of they're also

1072
00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:21,159
that they're a part of they're also
 

1073
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:22,909
that they're a part of they're also
dependent upon and being affected by the

1074
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:22,919
dependent upon and being affected by the
 

1075
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:26,149
dependent upon and being affected by the
group that they're part of and so this

1076
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:26,159
group that they're part of and so this
 

1077
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,029
group that they're part of and so this
now starts to get in deep into Political

1078
00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:28,039
now starts to get in deep into Political
 

1079
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:30,630
now starts to get in deep into Political
theories also which is theories that

1080
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:30,640
theories also which is theories that
 

1081
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,390
theories also which is theories that
Orient towards the collective at

1082
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:32,400
Orient towards the collective at
 

1083
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,070
Orient towards the collective at
different scales whether a tribal scale

1084
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,080
different scales whether a tribal scale
 

1085
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,710
different scales whether a tribal scale
or an Empire or a nation state or

1086
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:35,720
or an Empire or a nation state or
 

1087
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,390
or an Empire or a nation state or
something and ones that Orient towards

1088
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:37,400
something and ones that Orient towards
 

1089
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,149
something and ones that Orient towards
the individual liberalism and stuff like

1090
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:39,159
the individual liberalism and stuff like
 

1091
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:41,149
the individual liberalism and stuff like
that and I think there's very obvious

1092
00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:41,159
that and I think there's very obvious
 

1093
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,990
that and I think there's very obvious
failure modes on both sides and so the

1094
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,000
failure modes on both sides and so the
 

1095
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,549
failure modes on both sides and so the
relationship between them is more

1096
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:45,559
relationship between them is more
 

1097
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:46,950
relationship between them is more
interesting to me than either of them

1098
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:46,960
interesting to me than either of them
 

1099
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,430
interesting to me than either of them
the relationship between the individual

1100
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:48,440
the relationship between the individual
 

1101
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,430
the relationship between the individual
and the collective and the question

1102
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:49,440
and the collective and the question
 

1103
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,390
and the collective and the question
around how to have a virtuous process

1104
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:51,400
around how to have a virtuous process
 

1105
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,830
around how to have a virtuous process
between those so a good social system

1106
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:53,840
between those so a good social system
 

1107
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,430
between those so a good social system
would be one where the organism of the

1108
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:55,440
would be one where the organism of the
 

1109
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,390
would be one where the organism of the
individual and the organism of the group

1110
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,400
individual and the organism of the group
 

1111
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,710
individual and the organism of the group
of individuals is they're both

1112
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:00,720
of individuals is they're both
 

1113
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,269
of individuals is they're both
synergistic to each other so what is

1114
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:02,279
synergistic to each other so what is
 

1115
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:03,549
synergistic to each other so what is
best for the individuals and what's best

1116
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:03,559
best for the individuals and what's best
 

1117
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:04,630
best for the individuals and what's best
for the whole is

1118
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:04,640
for the whole is
 

1119
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,789
for the whole is
aligned but there is nevertheless an

1120
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:07,799
aligned but there is nevertheless an
 

1121
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:10,430
aligned but there is nevertheless an
individual they're not it's uh it's a

1122
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:10,440
individual they're not it's uh it's a
 

1123
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,710
individual they're not it's uh it's a
matter of degrees I suppose

1124
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:12,720
matter of degrees I suppose
 

1125
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,870
matter of degrees I suppose
but what is um what defines a human

1126
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:17,880
but what is um what defines a human
 

1127
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,830
but what is um what defines a human
more the the social network within they

1128
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:22,840
more the the social network within they
 

1129
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,510

00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:34,520
self like what's your intuition of how
 

1139
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,350
self like what's your intuition of how

much not just for evolutionary survival
 

1141

much not just for evolutionary survival
but as intellectual beings how much do

1239
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,230
Consciousness that we end up having that
is

1240
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:33,240
is
 

1241
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,870
is
socialized so I think I think we take

1242
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:35,880
socialized so I think I think we take
 

1243
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,510
socialized so I think I think we take
for granted how much conditioning

1244
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:38,520
for granted how much conditioning
 

1245
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:43,950
for granted how much conditioning
affects us um is it possible that

1246
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:43,960
affects us um is it possible that
 

1247
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,070
affects us um is it possible that
uh it affects basically

1248
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:47,080
uh it affects basically
 

1249
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,190
uh it affects basically
99.9 or maybe the whole thing the whole

1250
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:50,200
99.9 or maybe the whole thing the whole
 

1251
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,549
99.9 or maybe the whole thing the whole
thing is the connection between us

1252
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:51,559
thing is the connection between us
 

1253
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:55,389
thing is the connection between us
humans and that were we uh no better

1254
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:55,399
humans and that were we uh no better
 

1255
00:25:55,399 --> 00:25:58,870
humans and that were we uh no better
than Apes without our human connection

1256
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:58,880
than Apes without our human connection
 

1257
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,710
than Apes without our human connection
because that that thinking of it that

1258
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:01,720
because that that thinking of it that
 

1259
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,350
because that that thinking of it that
way forces us to think very differently

1260
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:04,360
way forces us to think very differently
 

1261
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,430
way forces us to think very differently
about human society and how to progress

1262
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:06,440
about human society and how to progress
 

1263

forward if the connections are

00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:08,799
forward if the connections are
 

1265
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,710
forward if the connections are
fundamental I just have to object to the

1266
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:11,720
fundamental I just have to object to the
 

1267
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,230
fundamental I just have to object to the
know better than Apes because better

1268
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:13,240
know better than Apes because better
 

1269
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,870
know better than Apes because better
here I think you mean a specific thing

1270
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:14,880
here I think you mean a specific thing
 

1271
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,389
here I think you mean a specific thing
which means have capacities that are

1272
00:26:16,389 --> 00:26:16,399
which means have capacities that are
 

1273
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:17,710
which means have capacities that are
fundamentally different then I think

1274
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:17,720
fundamentally different then I think
 

1275
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,590
fundamentally different then I think
Apes also depend upon troops um yes and

1276
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:22,600
Apes also depend upon troops um yes and
 

1277
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,710
Apes also depend upon troops um yes and
I I think the idea of humans as better

1278
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:25,720
I I think the idea of humans as better
 

1279
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,590
I I think the idea of humans as better
than nature in some kind of um ethical

1280
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:28,600
than nature in some kind of um ethical
 

1281
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,190
than nature in some kind of um ethical
sense ends up having heaps of problems

1282
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:30,200
sense ends up having heaps of problems
 

1283
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,430
sense ends up having heaps of problems
we'll table that we can come back to it

1284
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:32,440
we'll table that we can come back to it
 

1285
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,190
we'll table that we can come back to it
but when we say what is unique about

00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:34,200
but when we say what is unique about
 

1287
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,909
but when we say what is unique about
Homo sapian capacity relative to the

1288
00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:35,919
Homo sapian capacity relative to the
 

1289
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,590
Homo sapian capacity relative to the
other animals we currently inhabit the

1290
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:38,600
other animals we currently inhabit the
 

1291
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,590
other animals we currently inhabit the
biosphere with and I'm saying it that

1292
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:40,600
biosphere with and I'm saying it that
 

1293
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,909
biosphere with and I'm saying it that
way because there were other early

1294
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:41,919
way because there were other early
 

1295
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,350
way because there were other early
hominids that had some of these

1296
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:44,360
hominids that had some of these
 

1297
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,630
hominids that had some of these
capacities uh we

1298
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:46,640
capacities uh we
 

1299
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,070
capacities uh we
believe our tool creation and our

1300
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:49,080
believe our tool creation and our
 

1301
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,870
believe our tool creation and our
language creation and our coordination

1302
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:50,880
language creation and our coordination
 

1303
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,909
language creation and our coordination
are all kind of the results of a certain

1304
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:52,919
are all kind of the results of a certain
 

1305
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:55,029
are all kind of the results of a certain
type of capacity for

1306
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:55,039
type of capacity for
 

1307
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,590
type of capacity for
abstraction and other animals will use

1308
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:57,600
abstraction and other animals will use
 

1309
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,310
abstraction and other animals will use
tools but they don't evolve the tools

1310
00:26:59,310 --> 00:26:59,320
tools but they don't evolve the tools
 

1311
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,789
tools but they don't evolve the tools
they use they keep using the same types

1312
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:00,799
they use they keep using the same types
 

1313
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,510
they use they keep using the same types
of tools that they basically can find so

1314
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:03,520
of tools that they basically can find so
 

1315
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,230
of tools that they basically can find so
a chimp will notice that a rock can cut

1316
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:06,240
a chimp will notice that a rock can cut
 

1317
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,830
a chimp will notice that a rock can cut
a Vine that it wants to and it'll even

1318
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:07,840
a Vine that it wants to and it'll even
 

1319
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,549
a Vine that it wants to and it'll even
notice that a sharper Rock will cut it

1320
00:27:09,549 --> 00:27:09,559
notice that a sharper Rock will cut it
 

1321
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:11,590
notice that a sharper Rock will cut it
better and experientially it'll use the

1322
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:11,600
better and experientially it'll use the
 

1323
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,190
better and experientially it'll use the
sharper Rock and if you even give it a

1324
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:13,200
sharper Rock and if you even give it a
 

1325
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,510
sharper Rock and if you even give it a
knife it'll probably use the knife

1326
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:14,520
knife it'll probably use the knife
 

1327
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,950
knife it'll probably use the knife
because it's experiencing the

1328
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:15,960
because it's experiencing the
 

1329
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,149
because it's experiencing the
effectiveness but it doesn't make stone

1330
00:27:18,149 --> 00:27:18,159
effectiveness but it doesn't make stone
 

1331
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,710
effectiveness but it doesn't make stone
tools because that requires

1332
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:20,720
tools because that requires
 

1333
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,430
tools because that requires
understanding why one is sharper than

1334
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:22,440
understanding why one is sharper than
 

1335
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,549
understanding why one is sharper than
the other what is the abstract principle

1336
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:24,559
the other what is the abstract principle
 

1337
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,549
the other what is the abstract principle
called sharpness to then be able to

1338
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:26,559
called sharpness to then be able to
 

1339
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,149
called sharpness to then be able to
invent a sharper thing

1340
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:28,159
invent a sharper thing
 

1341
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,870
invent a sharper thing
that same abstraction makes language and

1342
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:30,880
that same abstraction makes language and
 

1343
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,710
that same abstraction makes language and
the ability for abstract

1344
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:32,720
the ability for abstract
 

1345
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,909
the ability for abstract
representation which makes the ability

1346
00:27:34,909 --> 00:27:34,919
representation which makes the ability
 

1347
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:38,269
representation which makes the ability
to coordinate in a more advanced set of

1348
00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:38,279
to coordinate in a more advanced set of
 

1349
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:40,230
to coordinate in a more advanced set of
ways so I do think our ability to

1350
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:40,240
ways so I do think our ability to
 

1351
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,870
ways so I do think our ability to
coordinate with each other is pretty

1352
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:41,880
coordinate with each other is pretty
 

1353
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,830
coordinate with each other is pretty
fundamental to the selection of what we

1354
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:43,840
fundamental to the selection of what we
 

1355
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,070
fundamental to the selection of what we
are as a species I wonder if that

1356
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:47,080
are as a species I wonder if that
 

1357
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,909
are as a species I wonder if that
coordination that connection is actually

1358
00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:49,919
coordination that connection is actually
 

1359
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,310
coordination that connection is actually
the thing that gives birth to

1360
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:51,320
the thing that gives birth to
 

1361
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,389
the thing that gives birth to
Consciousness that gives birth to well

1362
00:27:53,389 --> 00:27:53,399
Consciousness that gives birth to well
 

1363
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:56,110
Consciousness that gives birth to well
let's start with selfawareness it's more

1364
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:56,120
let's start with selfawareness it's more
 

1365
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,990
let's start with selfawareness it's more
like theory of Mind theory of mind yeah

1366
00:27:58,990 --> 00:27:59,000
like theory of Mind theory of mind yeah
 

1367
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,990
like theory of Mind theory of mind yeah
you know I I I I suppose there's

1368
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:01,000
you know I I I I suppose there's
 

1369
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,590
you know I I I I suppose there's
experiments that show that there's other

1370
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:02,600
experiments that show that there's other
 

1371
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,870
experiments that show that there's other
mammals that have a very crude theory of

1372
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:04,880
mammals that have a very crude theory of
 

1373
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,990
mammals that have a very crude theory of
mind not sure maybe dogs something like

1374
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:08,000
mind not sure maybe dogs something like
 

1375
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,549
mind not sure maybe dogs something like
that but actually dogs probably has to

1376
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:09,559
that but actually dogs probably has to
 

1377
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:12,310
that but actually dogs probably has to
do with that they co-evolved with humans

1378
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:12,320
do with that they co-evolved with humans
 

1379
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,110
do with that they co-evolved with humans
see it'd be interesting if that theory

1380
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:14,120
see it'd be interesting if that theory
 

1381
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,029
see it'd be interesting if that theory
of mind is what leads

1382
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:17,039
of mind is what leads
 

1383
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,630
of mind is what leads
to Consciousness in the way we think

1384
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:19,640
to Consciousness in the way we think
 

1385
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,509
to Consciousness in the way we think
about it is the richness of the

1386
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:22,519
about it is the richness of the
 

1387
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:23,950
about it is the richness of the
subjective experience that is

1388
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:23,960
subjective experience that is
 

1389
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,470
subjective experience that is
consciousness I have a inkling sense

1390
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:26,480
consciousness I have a inkling sense
 

1391
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,789
consciousness I have a inkling sense
that that only exist because we're

1392
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:28,799
that that only exist because we're
 

1393
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:29,750
that that only exist because we're
social

1394
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:29,760
social
 

1395
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,990
social
creatures that that that doesn't come uh

1396
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:33,000
creatures that that that doesn't come uh
 

1397
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,389
creatures that that that doesn't come uh
with this with the hardware and the

1398
00:28:34,389 --> 00:28:34,399
with this with the hardware and the
 

1399
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,630
with this with the hardware and the
software in the in the beginning that's

1400
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:36,640
software in the in the beginning that's
 

1401
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,909
software in the in the beginning that's
like uh that's learned as an effective

1402
00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:40,919
like uh that's learned as an effective
 

1403
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:44,350
like uh that's learned as an effective
uh tool for communication almost like we

1404
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:44,360
uh tool for communication almost like we
 

1405
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,470
uh tool for communication almost like we
we think we I think we think uh that

1406
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:46,480
we think we I think we think uh that
 

1407
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,909
we think we I think we think uh that
Consciousness is

1408
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:47,919
Consciousness is
 

1409
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,430
Consciousness is
fundamental and

1410
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:50,440
fundamental and
 

1411
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,789
fundamental and
uh maybe it's

1412
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:52,799
uh maybe it's
 

1413
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,509
uh maybe it's
not now there's um a bunch of folks kind

1414
00:28:56,509 --> 00:28:56,519
not now there's um a bunch of folks kind
 

1415
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:58,029
not now there's um a bunch of folks kind
of criticize the idea a that the

1416
00:28:58,029 --> 00:28:58,039
of criticize the idea a that the
 

1417
00:28:58,039 --> 00:28:59,509
of criticize the idea a that the
illusion of Consciousness is

1418
00:28:59,509 --> 00:28:59,519
illusion of Consciousness is
 

1419
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:02,630
illusion of Consciousness is
consciousness that it is just a facade

1420
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:02,640
consciousness that it is just a facade
 

1421
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,190
consciousness that it is just a facade
we use

1422
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:04,200
we use
 

1423
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,590
we use
to to uh help us construct theories of

1424
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:07,600
to to uh help us construct theories of
 

1425
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,509
to to uh help us construct theories of
mind you almost put yourself in the

1426
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:09,519
mind you almost put yourself in the
 

1427
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:12,310
mind you almost put yourself in the
world as a subjective being and that

1428
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:12,320
world as a subjective being and that
 

1429
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,509
world as a subjective being and that
experience you want to richly experience

1430
00:29:14,509 --> 00:29:14,519
experience you want to richly experience
 

1431
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:17,149
experience you want to richly experience
it as an individual person so that I

1432
00:29:17,149 --> 00:29:17,159
it as an individual person so that I
 

1433
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:19,710
it as an individual person so that I
could empathize with your

1434
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:19,720
could empathize with your
 

1435
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,470
could empathize with your
experience I find that notion compelling

1436
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:22,480
experience I find that notion compelling
 

1437
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,190
experience I find that notion compelling
mostly because it allows you to then

1438
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:24,200
mostly because it allows you to then
 

1439
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,590
mostly because it allows you to then
create robots that become conscious not

1440
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:27,600
create robots that become conscious not
 

1441
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,310
create robots that become conscious not
by being quote unquote conscious but by

1442
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:31,320
by being quote unquote conscious but by
 

1443
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,750
by being quote unquote conscious but by
just learning to fake it till they make

00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:33,760
just learning to fake it till they make

the first philosophy has to be semiotics
 

1577
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:14,909
the first philosophy has to be semiotics
because if you don't get semiotics right

1578
00:32:14,909 --> 00:32:14,919
because if you don't get semiotics right
 

1579

we end up importing different ideas and

1580
00:32:17,149 --> 00:32:17,159
we end up importing different ideas and
 

1581
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:18,710
we end up importing different ideas and
bad ideas right into the nature of the

1582
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:18,720
bad ideas right into the nature of the
 

1583
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,509
bad ideas right into the nature of the
language that we're using and then it's

1584
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:20,519
language that we're using and then it's
 

1585
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:22,710
language that we're using and then it's
very hard to do epistemology or ontology

1586
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:22,720
very hard to do epistemology or ontology
 

1587
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,870
very hard to do epistemology or ontology
together uh so I'm saying this to say

1588
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:25,880
together uh so I'm saying this to say
 

1589
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,789
together uh so I'm saying this to say
why I don't think we're going to get

1590
00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:26,799
why I don't think we're going to get
 

1591
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,110
why I don't think we're going to get
very far as I think we would have to go

1592
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,120
very far as I think we would have to go
 

1593
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,669
very far as I think we would have to go
very slowly in terms of defining what we

1594
00:32:31,669 --> 00:32:31,679
very slowly in terms of defining what we
 

1595
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,230
very slowly in terms of defining what we
mean by words and fundamental concepts

1596
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:34,240
mean by words and fundamental concepts
 

1597
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,750
mean by words and fundamental concepts
um well and also allowing our minds to

1598
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:36,760
um well and also allowing our minds to
 

1599
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,389
um well and also allowing our minds to
drift together for a time so our

1600
00:32:40,389 --> 00:32:40,399
drift together for a time so our
 

1601
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,190
drift together for a time so our
definitions of these terms align I think

1602
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:43,200

there's a creative impulse or a creative

pure essence of that kind of creative
 

1695
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,589
pure essence of that kind of creative
process um and I think the types of

1696
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:50,599
process um and I think the types of
 

1697
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:54,829
process um and I think the types of
experien was we've had and then one the

1698
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:54,839
experien was we've had and then one the
 

1699
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:56,190
experien was we've had and then one the
types of experience we've had make a big

00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:56,200
types of experience we've had make a big
 

1701
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,630
types of experience we've had make a big
deal to the nature of how we do symbol

1702
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:57,640
deal to the nature of how we do symbol

grounding the other thing is the types

1704
00:34:59,390 --> 00:34:59,400
grounding the other thing is the types
 

1705
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,310
grounding the other thing is the types
of experiences we have can't not be

1706
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:02,320
of experiences we have can't not be
 

1707
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,510
of experiences we have can't not be
interpreted through our existing

1708
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:03,520
interpreted through our existing
 

1709
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,950
interpreted through our existing
interpretive frames and most of the time

1710
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:05,960
interpretive frames and most of the time
 

1711
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,510
interpretive frames and most of the time
our interpretive frames are unknown even

1712
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:07,520
our interpretive frames are unknown even
 

1713
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,750
our interpretive frames are unknown even
TOS some of them and so so this is

1714
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:11,760
TOS some of them and so so this is
 

1715
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,630
TOS some of them and so so this is
tricky this is tricky topic um so I

1716
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:15,640
tricky this is tricky topic um so I
 

1717
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,270
tricky this is tricky topic um so I
guess there's a bunch of directions we

1718
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:17,280
guess there's a bunch of directions we
 

1719
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,390
guess there's a bunch of directions we
could go with it but I want to come back

1720
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:19,400
could go with it but I want to come back
 

1721
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,630
could go with it but I want to come back
to what the um impulse was that was

1722
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:21,640
to what the um impulse was that was
 

1723
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,030
to what the um impulse was that was
interesting around what is consciousness

1724
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:24,040
interesting around what is consciousness
 

1725
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,950
interesting around what is consciousness
and how does it relate to us as social

1726
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:25,960
and how does it relate to us as social
 

1727
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,630
and how does it relate to us as social
beings and how does it relate to the

1729
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,470
beings and how does it relate to the
possibility of Consciousness with it AIS

1730

1737
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,550
wonderful hiking partner okay yes let's
go back to the initial impulse of uh

1738
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:40,560
go back to the initial impulse of uh
 

1739
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,069
go back to the initial impulse of uh
what is consciousness and how does the

1740
00:35:42,069 --> 00:35:42,079
what is consciousness and how does the

the third person stuff has position and

the third person stuff has position and
 

1789
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,550
the third person stuff has position and
momentum and charge and stuff like that

1790
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:51,560
momentum and charge and stuff like that
 

1791
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,150
momentum and charge and stuff like that
that is measurable

1792
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,160
that is measurable
 

1793
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,150
that is measurable
repeatable I think of the nature of

1794
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:56,160
repeatable I think of the nature of

00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,390
repeatable I think of the nature of

they're different kinds of
 

1803
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,030
they're different kinds of
stuff and so I think about the evolution

1804
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:08,040
stuff and so I think about the evolution
 

1805
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,870
stuff and so I think about the evolution
of third person that we're quite used to

1806
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:09,880
of third person that we're quite used to

that neither like the like the idealists
 

1827
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,750
that neither like the like the idealists
do we reduce third person to first

1828
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:33,760
do we reduce third person to first
 

1829
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,950
do we reduce third person to first
person which is what idealists do or

obviously bom talked about uh an

1836
00:37:44,069 --> 00:37:44,079
obviously bom talked about uh an
 

1837
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,710
obviously bom talked about uh an

1839
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,990
implicate order that was deeper than and
gave rise to the explicate order of both

1840
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:48,000
gave rise to the explicate order of both

um Nagel talks about something like that

1842
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:49,880
um Nagel talks about something like that
 

1843
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,630
um Nagel talks about something like that
I have a slightly different sense of

I have a slightly different sense of
 

1845
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,349
I have a slightly different sense of
that but again I'll just kind of not

1846
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:53,359
that but again I'll just kind of not
 

1847
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,190
that but again I'll just kind of not
argue how that occurs for a moment and

1848
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:55,200
argue how that occurs for a moment and
 

1849
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,510
argue how that occurs for a moment and
say so rather than say does

1850
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:57,520
say so rather than say does

00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,349

co-evolving um do I think that it seems

1866
00:38:18,349 --> 00:38:18,359
co-evolving um do I think that it seems
 

1867
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:20,190
co-evolving um do I think that it seems
relatively likely that more advanced

relatively likely that more advanced

to self-reflexive abstract cognition
 

1879
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,750
to self-reflexive abstract cognition
yeah but I wouldn't say that's the

1880
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:36,760
yeah but I wouldn't say that's the
 

1881
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,190
yeah but I wouldn't say that's the
emergence of Consciousness I would say

1882
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:38,200
emergence of Consciousness I would say
 

1883
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,950
emergence of Consciousness I would say
it's increased complexity within the

it's increased complexity within the

00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,790
it's increased complexity within the
domain of first person corresponding to

domain of first person corresponding to
 

1887
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,630
domain of first person corresponding to
increased complexity and the

so what I say that obviously the Sapien

1896
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:53,599
so what I say that obviously the Sapien
 

1897
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,710
so what I say that obviously the Sapien

group selection to make that brain so

1904
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:03,760
group selection to make that brain so
 

1905
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,589
group selection to make that brain so
the group made it now that brain is

1906
00:39:05,589 --> 00:39:05,599
the group made it now that brain is
 

1907
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,630
the group made it now that brain is
there now if I take that a single person

1908
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:07,640
there now if I take that a single person
 

1909
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,309
there now if I take that a single person
with that brain out of the group and try

1910
00:39:09,309 --> 00:39:09,319
with that brain out of the group and try
 

1911
00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:11,270
with that brain out of the group and try
to raise them in a box they'll still not

00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:11,280
to raise them in a box they'll still not
 

1913
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,870
to raise them in a box they'll still not
be very interesting even with the brain

00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:13,880
be very interesting even with the brain
 

1915
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,150
be very interesting even with the brain
um but the brain does give Hardware

1916
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:16,160
um but the brain does give Hardware

00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,390
um but the brain does give Hardware

for the GPU and all ended up also trying
 

1971
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,950
for the GPU and all ended up also trying
to compute that it takes 10 watts to run

the brain about and then what does that

1974
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:33,280
the brain about and then what does that
 

1975
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,030
the brain about and then what does that
mean in terms of calories per day kilo

1976
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:35,040

1981
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,950
uh human brain that's 250 to 300
calories a day and uh so it ended up

1982
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:45,960
calories a day and uh so it ended up
 

1983
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,349
calories a day and uh so it ended up

mechanism so with cell aoma that's cells
that are born and die born or die and

that are born and die born or die and
 

2169
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,430
that are born and die born or die and
they only know about each other's

they only know about each other's
 

2171
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,390
they only know about each other's
neighbors and they're simple rules that

2172
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:35,400
neighbors and they're simple rules that
 

2173
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,990
neighbors and they're simple rules that
govern that interaction of birth and

00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:37,000
govern that interaction of birth and
 

2175
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,510
govern that interaction of birth and
death and then they create at scale

2176
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:40,520
death and then they create at scale
 

2177
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,670
death and then they create at scale
organisms that look like they take up

that the simple rules on cells is all

that the simple rules on cells is all
that it took to create that

that's it's

that's it's
 

2195
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,430
that's it's
sad in that we can't come up with a

sad in that we can't come up with a

only hope to come up with the thing the

00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:21,720
only hope to come up with the thing the
 

2207
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,910
only hope to come up with the thing the
fundamental physics or the fundamental

00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:23,920
fundamental physics or the fundamental
 

2209
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,750
fundamental physics or the fundamental
rules of that system I suppose it's sad

2210
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:25,760
rules of that system I suppose it's sad
 

2211
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,950
rules of that system I suppose it's sad
that we can't predict everything we know

2212
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:27,960
that we can't predict everything we know
 

2213
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,750
that we can't predict everything we know
about the mathematics of those systems

2214
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:29,760
about the mathematics of those systems
 

2215
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,030
about the mathematics of those systems
it seems like we can't really in a nice

2216
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:32,040
it seems like we can't really in a nice
 

2217
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,190
it seems like we can't really in a nice
way like economics tries to do to

2218
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:34,200
way like economics tries to do to
 

2219
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,990
way like economics tries to do to
predict how this whole thing will unroll

2220
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:37,000
predict how this whole thing will unroll
 

2221
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,349
predict how this whole thing will unroll
but it's beautiful because how simple it

2222
00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:39,359
but it's beautiful because how simple it
 

2223
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,510
but it's beautiful because how simple it
is underneath it

2224
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:41,520
is underneath it
 

2225
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,950
is underneath it
all so what do you make of uh the

2226
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:45,960
all so what do you make of uh the
 

2227
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,870
all so what do you make of uh the
emergence of complexity from Simple

2228
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:47,880
emergence of complexity from Simple
 

2229
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,470

him on your show so a lot of the
 

2315
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,349
him on your show so a lot of the
questions that you like one of Kaufman's

you know more recent books after

2318
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:38,240
you know more recent books after
 

2319
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,589
you know more recent books after
investigations and some of the real

2320
00:47:39,589 --> 00:47:39,599
investigations and some of the real
 

2321
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,150

00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:43,040
the sacred and it had to do with some of
 

2325
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,430
the sacred and it had to do with some of
these exact questions uh in kind of

00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:45,440
these exact questions uh in kind of
 

2327
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,069
these exact questions uh in kind of
non-reductionist approach but that is

2328
00:47:47,069 --> 00:47:47,079
non-reductionist approach but that is
 

2329
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:50,750
non-reductionist approach but that is
not just silly hippie ISM um and he was

2330
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:50,760
not just silly hippie ISM um and he was
 

2331
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,390
not just silly hippie ISM um and he was
very interested in highly non-erotic

very interested in highly non-erotic
 

2333

00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,750
systems where you couldn't take a lot of
behavior over a small period of time and

2336
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:56,760
behavior over a small period of time and
 

2337
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,549
behavior over a small period of time and
predict what the behavior of subsets

2338
00:47:58,549 --> 00:47:58,559
predict what the behavior of subsets
 

2339
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:01,790
predict what the behavior of subsets
over a longer period of time would do um

2340
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:01,800
over a longer period of time would do um
 

2341
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,910
over a longer period of time would do um
and then going further someone who spent

2342
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:03,920
and then going further someone who spent
 

2343
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,309
and then going further someone who spent
some time at Santa Institute and then

2344
00:48:05,309 --> 00:48:05,319
some time at Santa Institute and then
 

2345
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:06,829
some time at Santa Institute and then
kind of made a whole new field that you

2346
00:48:06,829 --> 00:48:06,839
kind of made a whole new field that you
 

2347
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:10,390
kind of made a whole new field that you
should have on Dave Snowden who some

one of the interesting things there is
 

2401
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,789
one of the interesting things there is
that their uniqueness is extremely low

00:50:22,839 --> 00:50:24,549
it more in terms of a numbers game um so
yeah I would say there's probably more

that uh how compelling is this worldview

2486
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:48,040
that uh how compelling is this worldview
 

2487
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:53,349
that uh how compelling is this worldview
to you of gerardi and mimetic theory of

Desire where maybe you can explain it
 

2491
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,829
Desire where maybe you can explain it
from your perspective but it seems like

00:50:58,829 --> 00:50:58,839
from your perspective but it seems like
 

2493
00:50:58,839 --> 00:51:01,190
from your perspective but it seems like
imitating each other is the

2494
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:01,200
imitating each other is the
 

2495
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,510
imitating each other is the
fundamental property of the behavior of

00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:04,520
fundamental property of the behavior of
 

2497
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,630
fundamental property of the behavior of
uh human

2498
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:05,640
uh human
 

2499
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,589

civilization well imitation is not

2500
00:51:07,589 --> 00:51:07,599
civilization well imitation is not
 

2501
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:10,670
civilization well imitation is not
unique to humans right monkeys imitate

2502
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:10,680
unique to humans right monkeys imitate
 

2503
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:14,309
unique to humans right monkeys imitate
um so a certain amount of learning

2504
00:51:14,309 --> 00:51:14,319
um so a certain amount of learning
 

2505
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,990
um so a certain amount of learning
through observing is not unique to

2506
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:17,000
through observing is not unique to
 

2507
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,670
through observing is not unique to
humans humans do more of it uh it's

2508
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:20,680
humans humans do more of it uh it's
 

2509
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,150
humans humans do more of it uh it's
actually kind of worth speaking to this

2510
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:22,160
actually kind of worth speaking to this
 

2511
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,390
actually kind of worth speaking to this
for a moment um monkeys can learn new

2512
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:25,400
for a moment um monkeys can learn new
 

2513
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,789
for a moment um monkeys can learn new
Behavior new we've even seen teaching an

2514
00:51:28,789 --> 00:51:28,799
Behavior new we've even seen teaching an
 

2515
00:51:28,799 --> 00:51:30,390
Behavior new we've even seen teaching an
ape sign language and then the ape

2516
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:30,400
ape sign language and then the ape
 

2517
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,190
ape sign language and then the ape
teaching other Apes sign language um so

2518
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:33,200
teaching other Apes sign language um so
 

2519
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,910
teaching other Apes sign language um so
that's a kind of mimesis right kind of

2520
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:34,920
that's a kind of mimesis right kind of
 

2521
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,950
that's a kind of mimesis right kind of
learning through

2522
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:36,960
learning through
 

2523
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,390
learning through
imitation and that needs to happen if

2524
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:39,400
imitation and that needs to happen if
 

2525
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,789
imitation and that needs to happen if
they need to learn or develop capacities

2526
00:51:41,789 --> 00:51:41,799
they need to learn or develop capacities
 

2527
00:51:41,799 --> 00:51:43,190
they need to learn or develop capacities
that are not just coded by their

2528
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:43,200
that are not just coded by their
 

2529
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,789
that are not just coded by their
genetics right so within the same genome

2530
00:51:45,789 --> 00:51:45,799
genetics right so within the same genome
 

2531
00:51:45,799 --> 00:51:47,870
genetics right so within the same genome
they're learning new things based on the

2532
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:47,880
they're learning new things based on the
 

2533
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,470
they're learning new things based on the
environment and So based on someone else

2534
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:50,480
environment and So based on someone else
 

2535
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,710
environment and So based on someone else
learn something first and so let's pick

2536
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:52,720
learn something first and so let's pick
 

2537
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,710
learn something first and so let's pick
it up uh how much a creature is the

2538
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:56,720
it up uh how much a creature is the
 

2539
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,470
it up uh how much a creature is the
result of just its genetic programming

2540
00:51:58,470 --> 00:51:58,480
result of just its genetic programming
 

2541
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,950
result of just its genetic programming
and how much it's learning is a very

2542
00:51:59,950 --> 00:51:59,960
and how much it's learning is a very
 

2543
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,150
and how much it's learning is a very
interesting

2544
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:01,160
interesting
 

2545
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,150
interesting
question and I think this is a place

2546
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:03,160
question and I think this is a place
 

2547
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,349
question and I think this is a place
where humans really show up radically

2548
00:52:05,349 --> 00:52:05,359
where humans really show up radically
 

2549
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:07,589
where humans really show up radically
different than everything else and you

2550
00:52:07,589 --> 00:52:07,599
different than everything else and you
 

2551
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:10,069
different than everything else and you
can see it in the in the neony how long

2552
00:52:10,069 --> 00:52:10,079
can see it in the in the neony how long
 

2553
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:12,109
can see it in the in the neony how long
we're basically

2554
00:52:12,109 --> 00:52:12,119
we're basically
 

2555
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:16,190
we're basically
fetal um that a the closest ancestors to

2556
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:16,200
fetal um that a the closest ancestors to
 

2557
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,670
fetal um that a the closest ancestors to
us if we look at a chimp a chimp can

2558
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:18,680
us if we look at a chimp a chimp can
 

2559
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,510
us if we look at a chimp a chimp can
hold on to its mother's fur while she

2560
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:20,520
hold on to its mother's fur while she
 

2561
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:23,270
hold on to its mother's fur while she
moves around day one and obviously we

2562
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:23,280
moves around day one and obviously we
 

2563
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,510
moves around day one and obviously we
see horses up and walking within 20

2564
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:25,520
see horses up and walking within 20
 

2565
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,069
see horses up and walking within 20
minutes the fact that it takes a human a

2566
00:52:28,069 --> 00:52:28,079
minutes the fact that it takes a human a
 

2567
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,870
minutes the fact that it takes a human a
year to be walking and it takes a horse

2568
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:29,880
year to be walking and it takes a horse
 

2569
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,990
year to be walking and it takes a horse
20 minutes and you say how many

2570
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:31,000
20 minutes and you say how many
 

2571
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,829
20 minutes and you say how many
multiples of 20 minutes go into a year

2572
00:52:32,829 --> 00:52:32,839
multiples of 20 minutes go into a year
 

2573
00:52:32,839 --> 00:52:34,589
multiples of 20 minutes go into a year
like that's a long period of

2574
00:52:34,589 --> 00:52:34,599
like that's a long period of
 

2575
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:36,670
like that's a long period of
helplessness that wouldn't work for a

2576
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:36,680
helplessness that wouldn't work for a
 

2577
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,069
helplessness that wouldn't work for a
horse right like they or anything else

2578
00:52:40,069 --> 00:52:40,079
horse right like they or anything else
 

2579
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:43,150
horse right like they or anything else
and and not only could we not hold on to

2580
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:43,160
and and not only could we not hold on to
 

2581
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,670
and and not only could we not hold on to
Mom in the first day it's three months

2582
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:45,680
Mom in the first day it's three months
 

2583
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,109
Mom in the first day it's three months
before we can move our head volitionally

2584
00:52:48,109 --> 00:52:48,119
before we can move our head volitionally
 

2585
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:49,990
before we can move our head volitionally
um so it's like what why are we

2586
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:50,000
um so it's like what why are we
 

2587
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,750
um so it's like what why are we
embryonic for so long basically it's

2588
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:53,760
embryonic for so long basically it's
 

2589
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,950
embryonic for so long basically it's
like like it's still still fetal on the

2590
00:52:55,950 --> 00:52:55,960
like like it's still still fetal on the
 

2591
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,510
like like it's still still fetal on the
outside had to be because couldn't keep

2592
00:52:58,510 --> 00:52:58,520
outside had to be because couldn't keep
 

2593
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,549
outside had to be because couldn't keep
growing inside and actually ever get out

2594
00:53:00,549 --> 00:53:00,559
growing inside and actually ever get out
 

2595
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:02,230
growing inside and actually ever get out
with big heads and narrower hips from

2596
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:02,240
with big heads and narrower hips from
 

2597
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,430
with big heads and narrower hips from
going upright

2598
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:04,440
going upright
 

2599
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,789
going upright
um so here's a place where there's a

2600
00:53:06,789 --> 00:53:06,799
um so here's a place where there's a
 

2601
00:53:06,799 --> 00:53:09,470
um so here's a place where there's a
co-evolution of the pattern of humans

2602
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:09,480
co-evolution of the pattern of humans
 

2603
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:12,789
co-evolution of the pattern of humans
specifically here are our neony and what

2604
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:12,799
specifically here are our neony and what
 

2605
00:53:12,799 --> 00:53:14,230
specifically here are our neony and what
that prends to

2606
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:14,240
that prends to
 

2607
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,630
that prends to
learning with our being tool making and

2608
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:17,640
learning with our being tool making and
 

2609
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,549
learning with our being tool making and
environment modifying creatures which is

2610
00:53:20,549 --> 00:53:20,559
environment modifying creatures which is
 

2611
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:22,630
environment modifying creatures which is
because we have the abstraction to make

2612
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:22,640
because we have the abstraction to make
 

2613
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,750
because we have the abstraction to make
tools we change our environments more

2614
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:24,760
tools we change our environments more
 

2615
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:25,950
tools we change our environments more
than other creatures change their

2616
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:25,960
than other creatures change their
 

2617
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,069
than other creatures change their
environments the next most environment

2618
00:53:28,069 --> 00:53:28,079
environments the next most environment
 

2619
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,349
environments the next most environment
modifying creature to us is like a

2620
00:53:30,349 --> 00:53:30,359
modifying creature to us is like a
 

2621
00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:33,309
modifying creature to us is like a
beaver and then you we're in La you fly

2622
00:53:33,309 --> 00:53:33,319
beaver and then you we're in La you fly
 

2623
00:53:33,319 --> 00:53:35,589
beaver and then you we're in La you fly
into LAX and you look at the just

2624
00:53:35,589 --> 00:53:35,599
into LAX and you look at the just
 

2625
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:38,030
into LAX and you look at the just
orthogonal grid going on forever in all

2626
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:38,040
orthogonal grid going on forever in all
 

2627
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,510
orthogonal grid going on forever in all
directions and you know we've recently

2628
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:40,520
directions and you know we've recently
 

2629
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,109
directions and you know we've recently
come into the anthropac where the

2630
00:53:42,109 --> 00:53:42,119
come into the anthropac where the
 

2631
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:43,430
come into the anthropac where the
surface of the Earth is changing more

2632
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:43,440
surface of the Earth is changing more
 

2633
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,150
surface of the Earth is changing more
from human activity than geological

2634
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:45,160
from human activity than geological
 

2635
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,069
from human activity than geological
activity and then beavers and you're

2636
00:53:47,069 --> 00:53:47,079
activity and then beavers and you're
 

2637
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:48,990
activity and then beavers and you're
like okay wow we're really in a class of

2638
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:49,000
like okay wow we're really in a class of
 

2639
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,069
like okay wow we're really in a class of
Our Own in terms of environment

2640
00:53:51,069 --> 00:53:51,079
Our Own in terms of environment
 

2641
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:54,710
Our Own in terms of environment
modifying yeah um so as soon as we

2642
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:54,720
modifying yeah um so as soon as we
 

2643
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,910
modifying yeah um so as soon as we
started

2644
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:55,920
started
 

2645
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:00,230
started
tool making we were able to change our

2646
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:00,240
tool making we were able to change our
 

2647
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,109
tool making we were able to change our
environments much more radically we

2648
00:54:02,109 --> 00:54:02,119
environments much more radically we
 

2649
00:54:02,119 --> 00:54:03,390
environments much more radically we
could put on clothes and go to a cold

2650
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:03,400
could put on clothes and go to a cold
 

2651
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,390
could put on clothes and go to a cold
place right and this is really important

2652
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:06,400
place right and this is really important
 

2653
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,630
place right and this is really important
because we actually went and became apex

2654
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:08,640
because we actually went and became apex
 

2655
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,470
because we actually went and became apex
predators in every environment we

2656
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:10,480
predators in every environment we
 

2657
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,470
predators in every environment we
functioned like apex predators the polar

2658
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:12,480
functioned like apex predators the polar
 

2659
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,549
functioned like apex predators the polar
bear can't leave the Arctic right and

2660
00:54:14,549 --> 00:54:14,559
bear can't leave the Arctic right and
 

2661
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,829
bear can't leave the Arctic right and
the the lion can't leave the Savannah

2662
00:54:16,829 --> 00:54:16,839
the the lion can't leave the Savannah
 

2663
00:54:16,839 --> 00:54:18,190
the the lion can't leave the Savannah
and the Orca can't leave the ocean and

2664
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:18,200
and the Orca can't leave the ocean and
 

2665
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,670
and the Orca can't leave the ocean and
we went and became apex predators in all

2666
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:19,680
we went and became apex predators in all
 

2667
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,990
we went and became apex predators in all
those environments because of our tool

2668
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:21,000
those environments because of our tool
 

2669
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,589
those environments because of our tool
creation capacity we could become better

2670
00:54:22,589 --> 00:54:22,599
creation capacity we could become better
 

2671
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:24,030
creation capacity we could become better
Predators than them adapted to the

2672
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:24,040
Predators than them adapted to the
 

2673
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,750
Predators than them adapted to the
environment or at least with our tools

2674
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:25,760
environment or at least with our tools
 

2675
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,030
environment or at least with our tools
adapted to the environment so in every

2676
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:28,040
adapted to the environment so in every
 

2677
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:31,870
adapted to the environment so in every
aspect towards any organism in any

2678
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:31,880
aspect towards any organism in any
 

2679
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:34,390
aspect towards any organism in any
environment we're incredibly good at

2680
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:34,400
environment we're incredibly good at
 

2681
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,510
environment we're incredibly good at
becoming apex predators yes and nothing

2682
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:37,520
becoming apex predators yes and nothing
 

2683
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,870
becoming apex predators yes and nothing
else can do that kind of thing there

2684
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:39,880
else can do that kind of thing there
 

2685
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,950
else can do that kind of thing there
there is no other apex predator that you

2686
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:42,960
there is no other apex predator that you
 

2687
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,630
there is no other apex predator that you
see the other apex predator is only

2688
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:44,640
see the other apex predator is only
 

2689
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,870
see the other apex predator is only
getting better at being a predator

2690
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:45,880
getting better at being a predator
 

2691
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,309
getting better at being a predator
through evolutionary process that's

2692
00:54:47,309 --> 00:54:47,319
through evolutionary process that's
 

2693
00:54:47,319 --> 00:54:49,309
through evolutionary process that's
super slow and that super slow process

2694
00:54:49,309 --> 00:54:49,319
super slow and that super slow process
 

2695
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:51,510
super slow and that super slow process
creates co- selective process with their

2696
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:51,520
creates co- selective process with their
 

2697
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,150
creates co- selective process with their
environment so as the Predator becomes a

2698
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:53,160
environment so as the Predator becomes a
 

2699
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,390
environment so as the Predator becomes a
tiny bit faster it eats more of the slow

2700
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:55,400
tiny bit faster it eats more of the slow
 

2701
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,349
tiny bit faster it eats more of the slow
prey the genes of the fast prey in breed

2702
00:54:57,349 --> 00:54:57,359
prey the genes of the fast prey in breed
 

2703
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:59,030
prey the genes of the fast prey in breed
and the prey becomes faster and so

2704
00:54:59,030 --> 00:54:59,040
and the prey becomes faster and so
 

2705
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,030
and the prey becomes faster and so
there's this kind of balancing and we in

2706
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:02,040
there's this kind of balancing and we in
 

2707
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,750
there's this kind of balancing and we in
because of our tool making we increased

2708
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:03,760
because of our tool making we increased
 

2709
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,710
because of our tool making we increased
our predatory capacity faster than

2710
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:05,720
our predatory capacity faster than
 

2711
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:06,910
our predatory capacity faster than
anything else could increase its

2712
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:06,920
anything else could increase its
 

2713
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,309
anything else could increase its
resilience to it as a result we start

2714
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:09,319
resilience to it as a result we start
 

2715
00:55:09,319 --> 00:55:10,950
resilience to it as a result we start
outstripping the environment and

2716
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:10,960
outstripping the environment and
 

2717
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,990
outstripping the environment and
extincting species following stone tools

2718
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:14,000
extincting species following stone tools
 

2719
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,270
extincting species following stone tools
and going and becoming apex predator

2720
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:15,280
and going and becoming apex predator
 

2721
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,309
and going and becoming apex predator
everywhere this is why we can't keep

2722
00:55:16,309 --> 00:55:16,319
everywhere this is why we can't keep
 

2723
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:17,710
everywhere this is why we can't keep
applying apex predator theories because

2724
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:17,720
applying apex predator theories because
 

2725
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,190
applying apex predator theories because
we're not an apex predator we're in apex

2726
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:19,200
we're not an apex predator we're in apex
 

2727
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,430
we're not an apex predator we're in apex
predator but we're something much more

2728
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:20,440
predator but we're something much more
 

2729
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:23,990
predator but we're something much more
than that um like just for an example

2730
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:24,000
than that um like just for an example
 

2731
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,029
than that um like just for an example
the top apex predator the world in Orca

2732
00:55:27,029 --> 00:55:27,039
the top apex predator the world in Orca
 

2733
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:29,190
the top apex predator the world in Orca
an orca can eat one big fish at a time

2734
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:29,200
an orca can eat one big fish at a time
 

2735
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,109
an orca can eat one big fish at a time
like one tuna and it'll miss most of the

2736
00:55:31,109 --> 00:55:31,119
like one tuna and it'll miss most of the
 

2737
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,510
like one tuna and it'll miss most of the
time or one

2738
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:32,520
time or one
 

2739
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,190
time or one
seal and we can put a mile long drift

2740
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:35,200

00:55:40,549 --> 00:55:40,559
entire School of them right we can
 

2745
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:42,029
entire School of them right we can
deplete the entire oceans of them that's

2746
00:55:42,029 --> 00:55:42,039
deplete the entire oceans of them that's
 

2747
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:43,430
deplete the entire oceans of them that's
not an orca right like that's not an

2748
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:43,440
not an orca right like that's not an
 

2749
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,190
not an orca right like that's not an
apex predator um and that's not even

2750
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:46,200
apex predator um and that's not even
 

2751
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,670
apex predator um and that's not even
including that we can then genetically

2752
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:47,680
including that we can then genetically
 

2753
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,789
including that we can then genetically
engineer different creatures we can

2754
00:55:49,789 --> 00:55:49,799
engineer different creatures we can
 

2755
00:55:49,799 --> 00:55:52,109
engineer different creatures we can
extinct species we can devastate whole

2756
00:55:52,109 --> 00:55:52,119
extinct species we can devastate whole
 

2757
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:53,870
extinct species we can devastate whole
ecosystems we can make built worlds that

2758
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:53,880
ecosystems we can make built worlds that
 

2759
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,270
ecosystems we can make built worlds that
have no natural things that are just

2760
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:55,280
have no natural things that are just
 

2761
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,870
have no natural things that are just
human built worlds we can build new

2762
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:56,880
human built worlds we can build new
 

2763
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,029
human built worlds we can build new
types of natural creature synthetic life

2764
00:55:59,029 --> 00:55:59,039
types of natural creature synthetic life
 

2765
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:01,069
types of natural creature synthetic life
so we were much more like little Gods

2766
00:56:01,069 --> 00:56:01,079
so we were much more like little Gods
 

2767
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:02,630
so we were much more like little Gods
than we are like apex predators now but

2768
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:02,640
than we are like apex predators now but
 

2769
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,150
than we are like apex predators now but
we're still behaving as apex predators

2770
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:04,160
we're still behaving as apex predators
 

2771
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,589
we're still behaving as apex predators
and little gods that behave as apex

2772
00:56:05,589 --> 00:56:05,599
and little gods that behave as apex
 

2773
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:07,950
and little gods that behave as apex
predators causes a problem kind of core

2774
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:07,960
predators causes a problem kind of core
 

2775
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,309
predators causes a problem kind of core
to my assessment of the world so what

2776
00:56:11,309 --> 00:56:11,319
to my assessment of the world so what
 

2777
00:56:11,319 --> 00:56:13,430
to my assessment of the world so what
does it mean to be a predator so a

2778
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:13,440
does it mean to be a predator so a
 

2779
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:17,270
does it mean to be a predator so a
predator is uh somebody that effectively

2780
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:17,280
predator is uh somebody that effectively
 

2781
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,069
predator is uh somebody that effectively
can mine the resources from a place so

2782
00:56:20,069 --> 00:56:20,079
can mine the resources from a place so
 

2783
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:21,150
can mine the resources from a place so
for their

2784
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:21,160
for their
 

2785
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:25,549
for their
survival or is it also just purely like

2786
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:25,559
survival or is it also just purely like
 

2787
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:28,670
survival or is it also just purely like
higher level objectives of violence and

2788
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:28,680
higher level objectives of violence and
 

2789
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,990
higher level objectives of violence and
what is can Predators be Predators

2790
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:31,000
what is can Predators be Predators
 

2791
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,470
what is can Predators be Predators
towards the same each other towards the

2792
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:33,480
towards the same each other towards the
 

2793
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,549
towards the same each other towards the
same species like how we think are we

2794
00:56:35,549 --> 00:56:35,559
same species like how we think are we
 

2795
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:36,990
same species like how we think are we
using the word Predator sort of

2796
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:37,000
using the word Predator sort of
 

2797
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,109
using the word Predator sort of
generally which then connects to

2798
00:56:39,109 --> 00:56:39,119
generally which then connects to
 

2799
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:41,829
generally which then connects to
conflict and uh military conflict

2800
00:56:41,829 --> 00:56:41,839
conflict and uh military conflict
 

2801
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:44,430
conflict and uh military conflict
violent conflict in in the space of uh

2802
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:44,440
violent conflict in in the space of uh
 

2803
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,950
violent conflict in in the space of uh
human species obviously we can say that

2804
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:46,960
human species obviously we can say that
 

2805
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,630
human species obviously we can say that
plants are mining the resources of their

2806
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:48,640
plants are mining the resources of their
 

2807
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,870
plants are mining the resources of their
environment in a particular way using

2808
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:50,880
environment in a particular way using
 

2809
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,349
environment in a particular way using
photosynthesis to be able to pull

2810
00:56:52,349 --> 00:56:52,359
photosynthesis to be able to pull
 

2811
00:56:52,359 --> 00:56:54,390
photosynthesis to be able to pull
minerals out of the soil and nitrogen

2812
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:54,400
minerals out of the soil and nitrogen
 

2813
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,309
minerals out of the soil and nitrogen
and carbon out of the air and like that

2814
00:56:57,309 --> 00:56:57,319
and carbon out of the air and like that
 

2815
00:56:57,319 --> 00:56:59,750
and carbon out of the air and like that
um and we can say herbivores are being

2816
00:56:59,750 --> 00:56:59,760
um and we can say herbivores are being
 

2817
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,589
um and we can say herbivores are being
able to mine and concentrate that so I

2818
00:57:01,589 --> 00:57:01,599
able to mine and concentrate that so I
 

2819
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:03,029
able to mine and concentrate that so I
wouldn't say mining the environment is

2820
00:57:03,029 --> 00:57:03,039
wouldn't say mining the environment is
 

2821
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:05,829
wouldn't say mining the environment is
unique to predator predator

2822
00:57:05,829 --> 00:57:05,839
unique to predator predator
 

2823
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:10,470
unique to predator predator
is you know

2824
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:10,480
is you know
 

2825
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:15,150
is you know
uh generally being defined as mining

2826
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:15,160
uh generally being defined as mining
 

2827
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:18,069
uh generally being defined as mining
other animals right we don't consider

2828
00:57:18,069 --> 00:57:18,079
other animals right we don't consider
 

2829
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:22,270
other animals right we don't consider
herbivores Predators but um animal which

2830
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:22,280
herbivores Predators but um animal which
 

2831
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,230
herbivores Predators but um animal which
requires some type of violence capacity

2832
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:24,240
requires some type of violence capacity
 

2833
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,870
requires some type of violence capacity
because animals move plants don't move

2834
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:26,880
because animals move plants don't move
 

2835
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,589
because animals move plants don't move
so requires some capacity to uh overtake

2836
00:57:30,589 --> 00:57:30,599
so requires some capacity to uh overtake
 

2837
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:32,430
so requires some capacity to uh overtake
something that can move and try to get

2838
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:32,440
something that can move and try to get
 

2839
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,309
something that can move and try to get
away um we'll go back to the Gerard

2840
00:57:35,309 --> 00:57:35,319
away um we'll go back to the Gerard
 

2841
00:57:35,319 --> 00:57:38,029
away um we'll go back to the Gerard
thing then we'll come back here why are

2842
00:57:38,029 --> 00:57:38,039
thing then we'll come back here why are
 

2843
00:57:38,039 --> 00:57:39,829
thing then we'll come back here why are
we Neo in this why are we embryonic for

2844
00:57:39,829 --> 00:57:39,839
we Neo in this why are we embryonic for
 

2845
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,710
we Neo in this why are we embryonic for
so

2846
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:40,720
so
 

2847
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,789
so
long because are we did we just move

2848
00:57:44,789 --> 00:57:44,799
long because are we did we just move
 

2849
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,510
long because are we did we just move
from the Savannah to the Arctic and we

2850
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:46,520
from the Savannah to the Arctic and we
 

2851
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,470
from the Savannah to the Arctic and we
need to learn new stuff if we came

2852
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:48,480
need to learn new stuff if we came
 

2853
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,230
need to learn new stuff if we came
genetically programmed we would not be

2854
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:50,240
genetically programmed we would not be
 

2855
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:52,870
genetically programmed we would not be
able to do that are we throwing Spears

2856
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:52,880
able to do that are we throwing Spears
 

2857
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,309
able to do that are we throwing Spears
or are we fishing or are we running an

2858
00:57:55,309 --> 00:57:55,319
or are we fishing or are we running an

00:57:55,319 --> 00:57:56,670
or are we fishing or are we running an
industrial supply chain or are we

2860
00:57:56,670 --> 00:57:56,680
industrial supply chain or are we
 

2861
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:59,349
industrial supply chain or are we
texting what is the Adaptive Behavior

2862
00:57:59,349 --> 00:57:59,359
texting what is the Adaptive Behavior
 

2863
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:01,150
texting what is the Adaptive Behavior
horses today in the wild and horses

2864
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:01,160
horses today in the wild and horses
 

2865
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,910
horses today in the wild and horses
10,000 years ago are doing pretty much

2866
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:02,920
10,000 years ago are doing pretty much
 

2867
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:06,150
10,000 years ago are doing pretty much
the same stuff and so since we make

2868
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:06,160
the same stuff and so since we make
 

2869
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,390
the same stuff and so since we make
tools and we evolve our tools and then

2870
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:08,400
tools and we evolve our tools and then
 

2871
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,510
tools and we evolve our tools and then
change our environment so quickly and

2872
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:10,520
change our environment so quickly and
 

2873
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,270
change our environment so quickly and
other animals are largely the result of

2874
00:58:12,270 --> 00:58:12,280
other animals are largely the result of
 

2875
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,990
other animals are largely the result of
their environment but we're environment

2876
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:14,000
their environment but we're environment
 

2877
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,549
their environment but we're environment
modifying so rapidly we need to come

2878
00:58:16,549 --> 00:58:16,559
modifying so rapidly we need to come
 

2879
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,270
modifying so rapidly we need to come
without too much programming so we can

2880
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:18,280
without too much programming so we can
 

2881
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,430
without too much programming so we can
learn the environment we're in learn the

2882
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:20,440
learn the environment we're in learn the
 

2883
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:24,349
learn the environment we're in learn the
language right which is uh going to be

2884
00:58:24,349 --> 00:58:24,359
language right which is uh going to be
 

2885
00:58:24,359 --> 00:58:25,829
language right which is uh going to be
very important learn the tool making

2886
00:58:25,829 --> 00:58:25,839
very important learn the tool making
 

2887
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:28,910
very important learn the tool making
learn the um and so we have a very long

2888
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:28,920
learn the um and so we have a very long
 

2889
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,789
learn the um and so we have a very long
period of relative helpless of

2890
00:58:30,789 --> 00:58:30,799
period of relative helpless of
 

2891
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:32,470
period of relative helpless of
helplessness because we aren't coded how

2892
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:32,480
helplessness because we aren't coded how
 

2893
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,549
helplessness because we aren't coded how
to behave yet because we're imprinting a

2894
00:58:34,549 --> 00:58:34,559
to behave yet because we're imprinting a
 

2895
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:36,349
to behave yet because we're imprinting a
lot of software on how to behave that is

2896
00:58:36,349 --> 00:58:36,359
lot of software on how to behave that is
 

2897
00:58:36,359 --> 00:58:39,190
lot of software on how to behave that is
useful to that particular time so our

2898
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:39,200
useful to that particular time so our
 

2899
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,349
useful to that particular time so our
mimesis is not it's not unique to humans

2900
00:58:41,349 --> 00:58:41,359
mimesis is not it's not unique to humans
 

2901
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:43,430
mimesis is not it's not unique to humans
but the total amount of it is really

2902
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:43,440
but the total amount of it is really
 

2903
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,390
but the total amount of it is really
unique and this is also where the

2904
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:45,400
unique and this is also where the
 

2905
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,390
unique and this is also where the
uniqueness can go up right is because we

2906
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:47,400
uniqueness can go up right is because we
 

2907
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,549
uniqueness can go up right is because we
are less just the result of the genetics

2908
00:58:49,549 --> 00:58:49,559
are less just the result of the genetics
 

2909
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:51,750
are less just the result of the genetics
and that means the kind of learning

2910
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:51,760
and that means the kind of learning
 

2911
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,230
and that means the kind of learning
through history that they got coded in

2912
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:53,240
through history that they got coded in
 

2913
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,390
through history that they got coded in
genetics and more the result of of it's

2914
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:55,400
genetics and more the result of of it's
 

2915
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,750

of doing these think of as a hardware

2920
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:03,000
of doing these think of as a hardware
 

2921
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,950
of doing these think of as a hardware

metaphors for biology but I'll use this

2924
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:06,520
metaphors for biology but I'll use this
 

2925
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:12,109
metaphors for biology but I'll use this
one here um that we have not had

2926
00:59:12,109 --> 00:59:12,119
one here um that we have not had
 

2927
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:14,870

Hardware changes since the beginning of

2928
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:14,880
Hardware changes since the beginning of
 

2929
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,190
Hardware changes since the beginning of
sapiens but our world is really really

2930
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:17,200
sapiens but our world is really really
 

2931
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,630
sapiens but our world is really really
different and that's all changes in the

2932
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:19,640
different and that's all changes in the
 

2933
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:22,349
different and that's all changes in the
software right changes in on the same

2934
00:59:22,349 --> 00:59:22,359
software right changes in on the same
 

2935
00:59:22,359 --> 00:59:25,349
software right changes in on the same
fundamental genetic substrate what we're

2936
00:59:25,349 --> 00:59:25,359
fundamental genetic substrate what we're
 

2937
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:27,390
fundamental genetic substrate what we're
doing with these brains and minds and

2938
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:27,400
doing with these brains and minds and
 

2939
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,589
doing with these brains and minds and
bodies and social groups and like that

2940
00:59:30,589 --> 00:59:30,599
bodies and social groups and like that
 

2941
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:31,309
bodies and social groups and like that
and

2942
00:59:31,309 --> 00:59:31,319
and
 

2943
00:59:31,319 --> 00:59:32,870
and
so

2944
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:32,880
so
 

2945
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,190
so
um now Gerard specifically was looking

2946
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:36,200
um now Gerard specifically was looking
 

2947
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:40,549
um now Gerard specifically was looking
at when we watch other people talking so

2948
00:59:40,549 --> 00:59:40,559
at when we watch other people talking so
 

2949
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:42,230
at when we watch other people talking so
we learn language you and I would have a

2950
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:42,240
we learn language you and I would have a
 

2951
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,789
we learn language you and I would have a
hard time learning Mandarin today or it

2952
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:43,799
hard time learning Mandarin today or it
 

2953
00:59:43,799 --> 00:59:44,829
hard time learning Mandarin today or it
would take a lot of work we'd be

2954
00:59:44,829 --> 00:59:44,839
would take a lot of work we'd be
 

2955
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:46,230
would take a lot of work we'd be
learning how to conjugate verbs and

2956
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:46,240
learning how to conjugate verbs and
 

2957
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,789
learning how to conjugate verbs and
stuff but a baby learns it instantly

2958
00:59:47,789 --> 00:59:47,799
stuff but a baby learns it instantly
 

2959
00:59:47,799 --> 00:59:49,069
stuff but a baby learns it instantly
without anyone even really trying to

2960
00:59:49,069 --> 00:59:49,079
without anyone even really trying to
 

2961
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:50,750
without anyone even really trying to
teach it just through mamisa so it's a

2962
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:50,760
teach it just through mamisa so it's a
 

2963
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,870
teach it just through mamisa so it's a
it's a powerful thing they're obviously

2964
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:52,880
it's a powerful thing they're obviously
 

2965
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,430
it's a powerful thing they're obviously
more neuroplastic than we are when

2966
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:54,440
more neuroplastic than we are when
 

2967
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:55,390
more neuroplastic than we are when
they're doing that and all their

2968
00:59:55,390 --> 00:59:55,400
they're doing that and all their
 

2969
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,349
they're doing that and all their
attentions allocated to that but they're

2970
00:59:57,349 --> 00:59:57,359
attentions allocated to that but they're
 

2971
00:59:57,359 --> 00:59:59,430
attentions allocated to that but they're
also learning how to move their bodies

2972
00:59:59,430 --> 00:59:59,440
also learning how to move their bodies
 

2973
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,470
also learning how to move their bodies
and they're learning all kinds of stuff

2974
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:01,480
and they're learning all kinds of stuff
 

2975
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,109
and they're learning all kinds of stuff
through mimesis one of the things that

2976
01:00:03,109 --> 01:00:03,119
through mimesis one of the things that
 

2977
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:04,670
through mimesis one of the things that
Jord says is they're also learning what

2978
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:04,680
Jord says is they're also learning what
 

2979
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:05,549
Jord says is they're also learning what
to

2980
01:00:05,549 --> 01:00:05,559
to
 

2981
01:00:05,559 --> 01:00:07,870
to
want and they learn what to want they

2982
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:07,880
want and they learn what to want they
 

2983
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,190
want and they learn what to want they
learn Desire by watching what other

2984
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:09,200
learn Desire by watching what other
 

2985
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,710
learn Desire by watching what other
people want and so intrinsic to this

2986
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:11,720
people want and so intrinsic to this
 

2987
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,150
people want and so intrinsic to this
people end up wanting what other people

2988
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:13,160
people end up wanting what other people
 

2989
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:16,870
people end up wanting what other people
want and if we can't have what other

2990
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:16,880
want and if we can't have what other
 

2991
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,750
want and if we can't have what other
people have without taking it away from

2992
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:19,760
people have without taking it away from
 

2993
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,029
people have without taking it away from
them then that becomes a source of

2994
01:00:21,029 --> 01:00:21,039
them then that becomes a source of
 

2995
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:24,150
them then that becomes a source of
conflict so uh the Mimis of Desire is

2996
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:24,160
conflict so uh the Mimis of Desire is
 

2997
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:27,390
conflict so uh the Mimis of Desire is
the fun generator of conflict and that

2998
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:27,400
the fun generator of conflict and that
 

2999
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,430
the fun generator of conflict and that
then the conflict energy within a group

3000
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:30,440
then the conflict energy within a group
 

3001
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:33,430
then the conflict energy within a group
of people will build over time this is a

3002
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:33,440
of people will build over time this is a
 

3003
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,349
of people will build over time this is a
very very crude interpretation of the

3004
01:00:35,349 --> 01:00:35,359
very very crude interpretation of the
 

3005
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:37,789
very very crude interpretation of the
theory can we just pause on that for

3006
01:00:37,789 --> 01:00:37,799
theory can we just pause on that for
 

3007
01:00:37,799 --> 01:00:40,029
theory can we just pause on that for
people who are not familiar and for me

3008
01:00:40,029 --> 01:00:40,039
people who are not familiar and for me
 

3009
01:00:40,039 --> 01:00:42,589
people who are not familiar and for me
who hasn't I'm Loosely familiar but

3010
01:00:42,589 --> 01:00:42,599
who hasn't I'm Loosely familiar but
 

3011
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:44,150
who hasn't I'm Loosely familiar but
Haven to internalize it but every time I

3012
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:44,160
Haven to internalize it but every time I
 

3013
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,510
Haven to internalize it but every time I
think about it it's a very compelling

3014
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:45,520

question about that um and that even
 

3113
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:47,910
question about that um and that even
today if you hang out in a place with

01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,990
clear right like the Behavioral Science
of this pretty clear so uh the whole

people we spend the most time around I
 

3131
01:03:04,359 --> 01:03:06,230
people we spend the most time around I
think the more self-reflective someone

3132

think the more self-reflective someone
 

3133
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,510
think the more self-reflective someone
is the more time they spend by

3134
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:07,520
is the more time they spend by
 

3135
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,029
is the more time they spend by
themselves in self-reflection the less

3136
01:03:09,029 --> 01:03:09,039
themselves in self-reflection the less
 

3137
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:10,990
themselves in self-reflection the less
this is true but it's still true so one

01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:41,390
probably interesting ways to play with
this you could probably put yourself

3172
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:41,400
this you could probably put yourself
 

3173
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,430
this you could probably put yourself
like form connections that have this

3174
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:44,440
like form connections that have this
 

3175
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:47,109
like form connections that have this
perfect tension in all directions to

3176
01:03:47,109 --> 01:03:47,119
perfect tension in all directions to
 

3177
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:48,710
perfect tension in all directions to
where you're actually free to decide

3178
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:48,720
where you're actually free to decide
 

3179
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,670
where you're actually free to decide
whatever the heck you want because the

3180
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:50,680
whatever the heck you want because the
 

3181
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:53,430
whatever the heck you want because the
set of wants within your circle of

01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:53,440
set of wants within your circle of
 

3183
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,630
set of wants within your circle of
interactions is so conflicting that

3184
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:56,640
interactions is so conflicting that
 

3185
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,190
interactions is so conflicting that
you're free to choose whichever one so

3186
01:03:59,190 --> 01:03:59,200
you're free to choose whichever one so
 

3187
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,230
you're free to choose whichever one so
if there's enough tension as opposed to

3188
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:01,240
if there's enough tension as opposed to
 

3189
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:03,670
if there's enough tension as opposed to
everybody align like a flock of birds

3190
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:03,680
everybody align like a flock of birds
 

3191
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,390
everybody align like a flock of birds
yeah you I mean you definitely want that

3192
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:05,400
yeah you I mean you definitely want that
 

3193
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:08,510
yeah you I mean you definitely want that
all of the dialectics would be

3194
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:08,520
all of the dialectics would be
 

3195
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:11,630
all of the dialectics would be
balanced um so if you

3196
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:11,640
balanced um so if you
 

3197
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:14,789
balanced um so if you
have someone who is extremely oriented

3198
01:04:14,789 --> 01:04:14,799
have someone who is extremely oriented
 

3199
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:16,750
have someone who is extremely oriented
to self-empowerment and someone who's

3200
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:16,760
to self-empowerment and someone who's
 

3201
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,589
to self-empowerment and someone who's
extremely oriented to kind of empathy

3202
01:04:18,589 --> 01:04:18,599
extremely oriented to kind of empathy
 

3203
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:20,670
extremely oriented to kind of empathy
and compassion both the dialectic of

3204
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:20,680
and compassion both the dialectic of
 

3205
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:21,910
and compassion both the dialectic of
those is better than either of them on

3206
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:21,920
those is better than either of them on
 

3207
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:25,069
those is better than either of them on
their own um if you both of them

3208
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:25,079
their own um if you both of them
 

3209
01:04:25,079 --> 01:04:27,470
their own um if you both of them
inhabiting being inhabited better than

3210
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:27,480
inhabiting being inhabited better than
 

3211
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:28,910
inhabiting being inhabited better than
you by the same person spending time

3212
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:28,920
you by the same person spending time
 

3213
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,710
you by the same person spending time
around that person will probably do well

3214
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:30,720
around that person will probably do well
 

3215
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:33,510
around that person will probably do well
for you um I think the thing you just

3216
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:33,520
for you um I think the thing you just
 

3217
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,789
for you um I think the thing you just
mentioned is super important when it

3218
01:04:34,789 --> 01:04:34,799
mentioned is super important when it
 

3219
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:38,670
mentioned is super important when it
comes to cognitive schools which

3220
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:38,680
comes to cognitive schools which
 

3221
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:41,109
comes to cognitive schools which
is I think one of the fastest things

3222
01:04:41,109 --> 01:04:41,119
is I think one of the fastest things
 

3223
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:43,430
is I think one of the fastest things
people can do to improve their learning

3224
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:43,440
people can do to improve their learning
 

3225
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,190
people can do to improve their learning
and their not just cognitive learning

3226
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:46,200
and their not just cognitive learning
 

3227
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:49,750
and their not just cognitive learning
but their meaningful problemsolving

3228
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:49,760
but their meaningful problemsolving
 

3229
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,069
but their meaningful problemsolving
communication and Civic capacity

3230
01:04:52,069 --> 01:04:52,079
communication and Civic capacity
 

3231
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:53,710
communication and Civic capacity
capacity to participate as a citizen

3232
01:04:53,710 --> 01:04:53,720
capacity to participate as a citizen
 

3233
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:55,150
capacity to participate as a citizen
with other people and making the world

3234
01:04:55,150 --> 01:04:55,160
with other people and making the world
 

3235
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:58,069
with other people and making the world
better is to be seeking dialectical

3236
01:04:58,069 --> 01:04:58,079
better is to be seeking dialectical
 

3237
01:04:58,079 --> 01:04:59,910
better is to be seeking dialectical
synthesis all the

3238
01:04:59,910 --> 01:04:59,920
synthesis all the
 

3239
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,549
synthesis all the
time and so in the hegelian sense if you

3240
01:05:02,549 --> 01:05:02,559
time and so in the hegelian sense if you
 

3241
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:03,390
time and so in the hegelian sense if you
have a

3242
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:03,400
have a
 

3243
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,670
have a
thesis you have an anti-thesis so maybe

3244
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:06,680
thesis you have an anti-thesis so maybe
 

3245
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,549
thesis you have an anti-thesis so maybe
we have libertarianism on one side and

3246
01:05:08,549 --> 01:05:08,559
we have libertarianism on one side and
 

3247
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:10,349
we have libertarianism on one side and
Marxist kind of Communism on the other

3248
01:05:10,349 --> 01:05:10,359
Marxist kind of Communism on the other
 

3249
01:05:10,359 --> 01:05:14,150
Marxist kind of Communism on the other
side and one is arguing that the

3250
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:14,160
side and one is arguing that the
 

3251
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,950
side and one is arguing that the
individual is the unit of choice and so

3252
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:16,960
individual is the unit of choice and so
 

3253
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,069
individual is the unit of choice and so
we want to uh increase the freedom and

3254
01:05:20,069 --> 01:05:20,079
we want to uh increase the freedom and
 

3255
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:21,870
we want to uh increase the freedom and
support of individual choice because as

3256
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:21,880
support of individual choice because as
 

3257
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,430
support of individual choice because as
they make more agentic choices it'll

3258
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:23,440
they make more agentic choices it'll
 

3259
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,470
they make more agentic choices it'll
produce a better for everybody the other

3260
01:05:25,470 --> 01:05:25,480
produce a better for everybody the other
 

3261
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:26,829
produce a better for everybody the other
side saying well the individuals are

3262
01:05:26,829 --> 01:05:26,839
side saying well the individuals are
 

3263
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:27,950
side saying well the individuals are
conditioned by their environment who

3264
01:05:27,950 --> 01:05:27,960
conditioned by their environment who
 

3265
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,510
conditioned by their environment who
would choose to be born into darur

3266
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:29,520
would choose to be born into darur
 

3267
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:32,829
would choose to be born into darur
rather than Finland um so we actually

3268
01:05:32,829 --> 01:05:32,839
rather than Finland um so we actually
 

3269
01:05:32,839 --> 01:05:35,349
rather than Finland um so we actually
need to collectively make

3270
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:35,359
need to collectively make
 

3271
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:37,750
need to collectively make
environments that are good because that

3272
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:37,760
environments that are good because that
 

3273
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,069
environments that are good because that
the environment conditions the

3274
01:05:39,069 --> 01:05:39,079
the environment conditions the
 

3275
01:05:39,079 --> 01:05:41,269
the environment conditions the
individuals so you have a thesis and an

3276
01:05:41,269 --> 01:05:41,279
individuals so you have a thesis and an
 

3277
01:05:41,279 --> 01:05:43,750
individuals so you have a thesis and an
antithesis and then hegel's idea is you

3278
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:43,760
antithesis and then hegel's idea is you
 

3279
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,109
antithesis and then hegel's idea is you
have a synthesis which is a kind of

3280
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:45,119
have a synthesis which is a kind of
 

3281
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:47,230
have a synthesis which is a kind of
higher order truth that understands how

3282
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:47,240
higher order truth that understands how
 

3283
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,710
higher order truth that understands how
those relate in a way that neither of

3284
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:48,720
those relate in a way that neither of
 

3285
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,990
those relate in a way that neither of
them do and so it is actually at a

3286
01:05:50,990 --> 01:05:51,000
them do and so it is actually at a
 

3287
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,150
them do and so it is actually at a
higher order of complexity so the first

3288
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:53,160
higher order of complexity so the first
 

3289
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,670
higher order of complexity so the first
part would be can I steal steal man each

3290
01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:54,680
part would be can I steal steal man each
 

3291
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,710
part would be can I steal steal man each
of these can I argue each one well

3292
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:56,720
of these can I argue each one well
 

3293
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,029
of these can I argue each one well
enough that the proponents of it are

3294
01:05:58,029 --> 01:05:58,039
enough that the proponents of it are
 

3295
01:05:58,039 --> 01:06:00,589
enough that the proponents of it are
like totally you got that and not just

3296
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:00,599
like totally you got that and not just
 

3297
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:02,390
like totally you got that and not just
argue it rhetorically but can I inhabit

3298
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:02,400
argue it rhetorically but can I inhabit
 

3299
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,829
argue it rhetorically but can I inhabit
it where I can try to see and feel the

3300
01:06:04,829 --> 01:06:04,839
it where I can try to see and feel the
 

3301
01:06:04,839 --> 01:06:06,750
it where I can try to see and feel the
world the way someone seeing and feeling

3302
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:06,760
world the way someone seeing and feeling
 

3303
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:09,630
world the way someone seeing and feeling
the world that way would CU once I do

3304
01:06:09,630 --> 01:06:09,640
the world that way would CU once I do
 

3305
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,309
the world that way would CU once I do
then I don't want to screw those people

3306
01:06:11,309 --> 01:06:11,319
then I don't want to screw those people
 

3307
01:06:11,319 --> 01:06:13,109
then I don't want to screw those people
because there's truth in it right and

3308
01:06:13,109 --> 01:06:13,119
because there's truth in it right and
 

3309
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,269
because there's truth in it right and
I'm not going to go back to war with

3310
01:06:14,269 --> 01:06:14,279
I'm not going to go back to war with
 

3311
01:06:14,279 --> 01:06:15,510
I'm not going to go back to war with
them I'm going to go to finding

3312
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:15,520
them I'm going to go to finding
 

3313
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,069
them I'm going to go to finding
solutions that could actually work at a

3314
01:06:17,069 --> 01:06:17,079
solutions that could actually work at a
 

3315
01:06:17,079 --> 01:06:19,190
solutions that could actually work at a
higher order if I don't go to a higher

3316
01:06:19,190 --> 01:06:19,200
higher order if I don't go to a higher
 

3317
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,510
higher order if I don't go to a higher
order then there's

3318
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:20,520
order then there's
 

3319
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:22,910
order then there's
war and but then the higher order thing

3320
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:22,920
war and but then the higher order thing
 

3321
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,510
war and but then the higher order thing
would be well it seems like the

3322
01:06:24,510 --> 01:06:24,520
would be well it seems like the
 

3323
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:27,710
would be well it seems like the
individual does affect the commons and

3324
01:06:27,710 --> 01:06:27,720
individual does affect the commons and
 

3325
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:29,109
individual does affect the commons and
the collective and other people it also

3326
01:06:29,109 --> 01:06:29,119
the collective and other people it also
 

3327
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:31,269
the collective and other people it also
seems like the collective conditions

3328
01:06:31,269 --> 01:06:31,279
seems like the collective conditions
 

3329
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:33,190
seems like the collective conditions
individuals at least statistically and I

3330
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:33,200
individuals at least statistically and I
 

3331
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,870
individuals at least statistically and I
can cherry pick out the one guy who got

3332
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:34,880
can cherry pick out the one guy who got
 

3333
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:37,349
can cherry pick out the one guy who got
out of the ghetto um and pulled himself

3334
01:06:37,349 --> 01:06:37,359
out of the ghetto um and pulled himself
 

3335
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:39,190
out of the ghetto um and pulled himself
up by his bootstraps but I can also say

3336
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:39,200
up by his bootstraps but I can also say
 

3337
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,870
up by his bootstraps but I can also say
statistically that most people born into

3338
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:40,880
statistically that most people born into
 

3339
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,470
statistically that most people born into
the ghetto show up differently than most

3340
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:42,480
the ghetto show up differently than most
 

3341
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,029
the ghetto show up differently than most
people born into the Hamptons and so

3342
01:06:46,029 --> 01:06:46,039
people born into the Hamptons and so
 

3343
01:06:46,039 --> 01:06:48,029
people born into the Hamptons and so
unless you want to argue that and have

3344
01:06:48,029 --> 01:06:48,039
unless you want to argue that and have
 

3345
01:06:48,039 --> 01:06:49,309
unless you want to argue that and have
you take your child from The Hamptons

3346
01:06:49,309 --> 01:06:49,319
you take your child from The Hamptons
 

3347
01:06:49,319 --> 01:06:51,150
you take your child from The Hamptons
and put him in the ghetto then like come

3348
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:51,160
and put him in the ghetto then like come
 

3349
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:53,630
and put him in the ghetto then like come
on be realistic about this thing so how

3350
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:53,640
on be realistic about this thing so how
 

3351
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:56,230
on be realistic about this thing so how
do we make we don't want social systems

3352
01:06:56,230 --> 01:06:56,240
do we make we don't want social systems
 

3353
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:59,710
do we make we don't want social systems
that make weak dependent individuals

3354

that make weak dependent individuals
 

3355
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,349
that make weak dependent individuals
right the the welfare argument but we

3356
01:07:01,349 --> 01:07:01,359
right the the welfare argument but we
 

3357
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:04,069
right the the welfare argument but we
also don't want no social system that

01:09:23,870 --> 01:09:23,880
other people if they feel that's really
 

3487
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:26,990
other people if they feel that's really
going to mess them up right and so the

3488
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:27,000
going to mess them up right and so the
 

3489
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,430
going to mess them up right and so the
rigorous empathy it's different than

3490
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:28,440
rigorous empathy it's different than
 

3491
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:30,110
rigorous empathy it's different than
just compassion which is I generally

3492
01:09:30,110 --> 01:09:30,120
just compassion which is I generally
 

3493
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,510
just compassion which is I generally
care like I have a generalized care but

3494
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:32,520
care like I have a generalized care but
 

3495
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:34,309
care like I have a generalized care but
I don't know what it's like to be them I

3496
01:09:34,309 --> 01:09:34,319
I don't know what it's like to be them I
 

3497
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:35,789
I don't know what it's like to be them I
can never know what it's like to be them

3498
01:09:35,789 --> 01:09:35,799
can never know what it's like to be them
 

3499
01:09:35,799 --> 01:09:37,390
can never know what it's like to be them
perfectly and that there's a humility

3500
01:09:37,390 --> 01:09:37,400
perfectly and that there's a humility
 

3501
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:40,110
perfectly and that there's a humility
you have to have which is my most

3502
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:40,120
you have to have which is my most
 

3503
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,870
you have to have which is my most
rigorous attempt is still not it my most

3504
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:42,880
rigorous attempt is still not it my most
 

3505
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,030
rigorous attempt is still not it my most
rigorous attempt mine to know what it's

3506
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:45,040
rigorous attempt mine to know what it's
 

3507
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,829
rigorous attempt mine to know what it's
like to be a woman is still not it I

3508
01:09:46,829 --> 01:09:46,839
like to be a woman is still not it I
 

3509
01:09:46,839 --> 01:09:48,070
like to be a woman is still not it I
have no question that if I was actually

3510
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:48,080
have no question that if I was actually
 

3511
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,269
have no question that if I was actually
a woman it would be different than my

3512
01:09:49,269 --> 01:09:49,279
a woman it would be different than my
 

3513
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:51,349
a woman it would be different than my
best guesses I have no question if I was

3514
01:09:51,349 --> 01:09:51,359
best guesses I have no question if I was
 

3515
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:52,990
best guesses I have no question if I was
actually black it be different than my

3516
01:09:52,990 --> 01:09:53,000
actually black it be different than my
 

3517
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,350
actually black it be different than my
best guesses

3518
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:54,360
best guesses
 

3519
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,830
best guesses
so there's a humility in that which

3520
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:55,840
so there's a humility in that which
 

3521
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,630
so there's a humility in that which
keeps me listening because I don't think

3522
01:09:57,630 --> 01:09:57,640
keeps me listening because I don't think
 

3523
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,830
keeps me listening because I don't think
that I know fully but I want to and I'm

3524
01:09:59,830 --> 01:09:59,840
that I know fully but I want to and I'm
 

3525
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,470
that I know fully but I want to and I'm
going to keep trying better to and then

3526
01:10:02,470 --> 01:10:02,480
going to keep trying better to and then
 

3527
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,070
going to keep trying better to and then
I want to across them and then I want to

3528
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:04,080
I want to across them and then I want to
 

3529
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:05,750
I want to across them and then I want to
say is there a way we can forward

3530
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:05,760
say is there a way we can forward
 

3531
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,950
say is there a way we can forward
together and not have to be in war it

3532
01:10:07,950 --> 01:10:07,960
together and not have to be in war it
 

3533
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:09,990
together and not have to be in war it
has to be something that could meet the

3534
01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:10,000
has to be something that could meet the
 

3535
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,830
has to be something that could meet the
values that everyone holds that could

3536
01:10:11,830 --> 01:10:11,840
values that everyone holds that could
 

3537
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,910
values that everyone holds that could
reconcile the partial sense making that

3538
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:13,920
reconcile the partial sense making that
 

3539
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,630
reconcile the partial sense making that
everyone holds and that could offer a

3540
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:15,640
everyone holds and that could offer a
 

3541
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:19,110
everyone holds and that could offer a
way forward that is more agreable than

3542
01:10:19,110 --> 01:10:19,120
way forward that is more agreable than
 

3543
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,550
way forward that is more agreable than
the partial perspectives at war with

3544
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:20,560
the partial perspectives at war with
 

3545
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,590
the partial perspectives at war with
each other but the so the more you

3546
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:22,600
each other but the so the more you
 

3547
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:25,510
each other but the so the more you
succeed at the sympathy with humility

3548
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:25,520
succeed at the sympathy with humility
 

3549
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,390
succeed at the sympathy with humility
the more you're carrying the burden of

3550
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:27,400
the more you're carrying the burden of
 

3551
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:30,950
the more you're carrying the burden of
their of other people's pain essentially

3552
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:30,960
their of other people's pain essentially
 

3553
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,590
their of other people's pain essentially
now this goes back to the question of do

3554
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:32,600
now this goes back to the question of do
 

3555
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:37,790
now this goes back to the question of do
I see us as one being or 7.8 billion

3556
01:10:37,790 --> 01:10:37,800
I see us as one being or 7.8 billion
 

3557
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:41,310
I see us as one being or 7.8 billion
yeah I think

3558
01:10:41,310 --> 01:10:41,320
yeah I think
 

3559
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:44,270
yeah I think
the if I'm overwhelmed with my own pain

3560
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:44,280
the if I'm overwhelmed with my own pain
 

3561
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:46,870
the if I'm overwhelmed with my own pain
I can't empathize that much because I

3562
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:46,880
I can't empathize that much because I
 

3563
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,229
I can't empathize that much because I
don't have the bandwidth I don't have

3564
01:10:48,229 --> 01:10:48,239
don't have the bandwidth I don't have
 

3565
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:50,630
don't have the bandwidth I don't have
the capacity if I don't feel like I can

3566
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:50,640
the capacity if I don't feel like I can
 

3567
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,310
the capacity if I don't feel like I can
do something about a particular problem

3568
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:52,320
do something about a particular problem
 

3569
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,790
do something about a particular problem
in the world it's hard to feel it cuz

3570
01:10:53,790 --> 01:10:53,800
in the world it's hard to feel it cuz
 

3571
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:54,830
in the world it's hard to feel it cuz
it's just too

3572
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:54,840
it's just too
 

3573
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,830
it's just too
devastating and so a lot of people go

3574
01:10:56,830 --> 01:10:56,840
devastating and so a lot of people go
 

3575
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,430
devastating and so a lot of people go
numb and even go nihilistic because they

3576
01:10:59,430 --> 01:10:59,440
numb and even go nihilistic because they
 

3577
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,750
numb and even go nihilistic because they
just don't feel the agency so as I

3578
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:01,760
just don't feel the agency so as I
 

3579
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,149
just don't feel the agency so as I
actually become more empowered as an

3580
01:11:03,149 --> 01:11:03,159
actually become more empowered as an
 

3581
01:11:03,159 --> 01:11:05,630
actually become more empowered as an
individual and have more sense of agency

3582
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:05,640
individual and have more sense of agency
 

3583
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:07,350
individual and have more sense of agency
I also become more empowered to be more

3584
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:07,360
I also become more empowered to be more
 

3585
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,910
I also become more empowered to be more
empathetic for others and be more

3586
01:11:08,910 --> 01:11:08,920
empathetic for others and be more
 

3587
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:11,149
empathetic for others and be more
connected to that shared burden and want

3588
01:11:11,149 --> 01:11:11,159
connected to that shared burden and want
 

3589
01:11:11,159 --> 01:11:13,550
connected to that shared burden and want
to be able to make choices on behalf of

3590
01:11:13,550 --> 01:11:13,560
to be able to make choices on behalf of
 

3591
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:18,990
to be able to make choices on behalf of
and in and in benefit of so this way of

3592
01:11:18,990 --> 01:11:19,000
and in and in benefit of so this way of
 

3593
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,149
and in and in benefit of so this way of
living seems like a way of living that

3594
01:11:22,149 --> 01:11:22,159
living seems like a way of living that
 

3595
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:25,310
living seems like a way of living that
would solve a lot of problems in society

3596
01:11:25,310 --> 01:11:25,320
would solve a lot of problems in society
 

3597
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:27,310
would solve a lot of problems in society
from a cellular aom

3598
01:11:27,310 --> 01:11:27,320
from a cellular aom
 

3599
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,430
from a cellular aom
perspective so if you have a bunch of

3600
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:29,440
perspective so if you have a bunch of
 

3601
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,470
perspective so if you have a bunch of
little like little agents behaving in

3602
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:31,480
little like little agents behaving in
 

3603
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:33,990
little like little agents behaving in
this way my intuition there'll be

3604
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:34,000
this way my intuition there'll be
 

3605
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,750
this way my intuition there'll be
interesting complexities that emerge but

3606
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:35,760
interesting complexities that emerge but
 

3607
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,470
interesting complexities that emerge but
my intuition is it will create a society

3608
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:38,480
my intuition is it will create a society
 

3609
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,510
my intuition is it will create a society
that's very different and

3610
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:40,520
that's very different and
 

3611
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:43,629
that's very different and
recognizably better than the one we have

3612
01:11:43,629 --> 01:11:43,639
recognizably better than the one we have
 

3613
01:11:43,639 --> 01:11:48,110
recognizably better than the one we have
today how much um like oh wait hold that

3614
01:11:48,110 --> 01:11:48,120
today how much um like oh wait hold that
 

3615
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:49,270
today how much um like oh wait hold that
question cuz I want to come back to it

3616
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:49,280
question cuz I want to come back to it
 

3617
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:50,669
question cuz I want to come back to it
but this brings us back to jard which we

3618
01:11:50,669 --> 01:11:50,679
but this brings us back to jard which we
 

3619
01:11:50,679 --> 01:11:52,910
but this brings us back to jard which we
didn't answer the conflict theory yes

3620
01:11:52,910 --> 01:11:52,920
didn't answer the conflict theory yes
 

3621
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,590
didn't answer the conflict theory yes
cuz about how to get past the conflict

3622
01:11:54,590 --> 01:11:54,600
cuz about how to get past the conflict
 

3623
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,070
cuz about how to get past the conflict
theory yes you know the Robert Frost

3624
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:56,080
theory yes you know the Robert Frost
 

3625
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,390
theory yes you know the Robert Frost
poem about the two paths you never have

3626
01:11:58,390 --> 01:11:58,400
poem about the two paths you never have
 

3627
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,990
poem about the two paths you never have
time to turn back to the other we're GNA

3628
01:11:59,990 --> 01:12:00,000
time to turn back to the other we're GNA
 

3629
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,470
time to turn back to the other we're GNA
have to do that quite a lot we're going

3630
01:12:01,470 --> 01:12:01,480
have to do that quite a lot we're going
 

3631
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:05,229
have to do that quite a lot we're going
to be uh living that poem over and over

3632
01:12:05,229 --> 01:12:05,239
to be uh living that poem over and over
 

3633
01:12:05,239 --> 01:12:08,910
to be uh living that poem over and over
again but yes how how to uh let's return

3634
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:08,920
again but yes how how to uh let's return
 

3635
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:10,870
again but yes how how to uh let's return
back okay so the rest of the argument

3636
01:12:10,870 --> 01:12:10,880
back okay so the rest of the argument
 

3637
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,110
back okay so the rest of the argument
goes you learn to want what other people

3638
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:13,120
goes you learn to want what other people
 

3639

conflict by watching and so then the
 

3655
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,470

conflict becomes meic so the and you
 

3657
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:35,830

know we become on the the Palestinian
 

3659
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:36,910

3666
01:12:43,229 --> 01:12:43,239
and until eventually the conflict energy
 

3667
01:12:43,239 --> 01:12:46,110
and until eventually the conflict energy
in the system builds up so much that

about why scapegoating was kind of a
 

3677
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,229
about why scapegoating was kind of a
mechanism to minimize the amount of

they really were but if we all believe
 

3685
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,350
they really were but if we all believe
it then we can all kind of calm down

3686
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:02,360
it then we can all kind of calm down
 

3687
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:03,510
it then we can all kind of calm down
with the conflict

3688
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:03,520
with the conflict

energy it's a really interesting concept

3690
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:05,760
energy it's a really interesting concept
 

3691
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,550
energy it's a really interesting concept
by the way I mean you went you

3692
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:07,560
by the way I mean you went you
 

3693
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:09,390
by the way I mean you went you
beautifully summarized it but the idea

3694
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:09,400
beautifully summarized it but the idea
 

3695
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:11,070
beautifully summarized it but the idea
that there's escape goat that there's a

3696
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:11,080
that there's escape goat that there's a

that there's escape goat that there's a
this kind of thing naturally leads to a

3698
01:13:12,629 --> 01:13:12,639
this kind of thing naturally leads to a
 

3699
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:15,110
this kind of thing naturally leads to a
conflict and then they find the other

3700
01:13:15,110 --> 01:13:15,120
conflict and then they find the other
 

3701
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,270
conflict and then they find the other
some group that's the other that's

3702
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:17,280
some group that's the other that's
 

3703
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,350
some group that's the other that's
either real or artificial as the cause

3704
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:19,360
either real or artificial as the cause
 

3705
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:21,430
either real or artificial as the cause
of the conflict and well it's always

3706
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:21,440
of the conflict and well it's always
 

3707
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,430
of the conflict and well it's always
artificial because the cause of the conf

3708
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:23,440
artificial because the cause of the conf
 

3709
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,110
artificial because the cause of the conf
conflict and Gerard is the mimesis of

3710
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:25,120
conflict and Gerard is the mimesis of
 

3711
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,470
conflict and Gerard is the mimesis of
Desire itself and how do we attack that

3712
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:27,480
Desire itself and how do we attack that
 

3713
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,070
Desire itself and how do we attack that
how do we attack that it's our own

3714
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:29,080
how do we attack that it's our own
 

3715
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,229
how do we attack that it's our own
desire so this now gets to something

3716
01:13:31,229 --> 01:13:31,239
desire so this now gets to something
 

3717
01:13:31,239 --> 01:13:33,030
desire so this now gets to something
more like Buddha said right which was

Gerard and Buddha would kind of agree in
 

3723
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:41,830
Gerard and Buddha would kind of agree in
this way so and so but that's that

3724
01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:41,840
this way so and so but that's that
 

3725
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:44,750
this way so and so but that's that

increasing conflict and then scapegoat
 

3755
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,270

01:14:39,629 --> 01:14:39,639
that's called The Joe Rogan theory of
 

3773
01:14:39,639 --> 01:14:42,669
that's called The Joe Rogan theory of
desire which is uh he's like all all of

human problems have to do with the fact

3776
01:14:44,270 --> 01:14:44,280
human problems have to do with the fact
 

3777
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:45,590
human problems have to do with the fact
that you don't do enough hard [\h__\h] in

01:14:45,590 --> 01:14:45,600
that you don't do enough hard [\h__\h] in
 

3779
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,590
that you don't do enough hard [\h__\h] in
your day uh so maybe maybe could just

01:14:48,590 --> 01:14:48,600
your day uh so maybe maybe could just
 

3781
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:50,310
your day uh so maybe maybe could just

gets all the demons out maybe just danc
 

3787
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,669
gets all the demons out maybe just danc
and gets all the demons out so this is

3788
01:14:55,669 --> 01:14:55,679
and gets all the demons out so this is
 

3789
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:57,189
and gets all the demons out so this is
why I say we have to be careful with

3790
01:14:57,189 --> 01:14:57,199
why I say we have to be careful with
 

3791
01:14:57,199 --> 01:14:59,470
why I say we have to be careful with

yeah I don't think this
 

3907
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:18,350
yeah I don't think this
sucks that so that's a feature not a bug

sucks that so that's a feature not a bug
well that's assuming a designer um I

3910
01:17:21,629 --> 01:17:21,639
well that's assuming a designer um I
 

3911
01:17:21,639 --> 01:17:23,510
well that's assuming a designer um I
would say I don't think it sucks I think

3912
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:23,520
would say I don't think it sucks I think
 

3913
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:26,070
would say I don't think it sucks I think

you're disagree with Jordan Pierson you

3920
01:17:33,550 --> 01:17:33,560
you're disagree with Jordan Pierson you
 

3921
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,629
you're disagree with Jordan Pierson you
should clean up your room you like the

3922
01:17:35,629 --> 01:17:35,639
should clean up your room you like the
 

3923
01:17:35,639 --> 01:17:37,950
should clean up your room you like the
room's messy it's h it's essential for

01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:37,960
room's messy it's h it's essential for
 

3925
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:41,750
room's messy it's h it's essential for
the for beauty it's not it's not that

3926
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:41,760
the for beauty it's not it's not that

okay I take I have no idea if it was

3928
01:17:44,830 --> 01:17:44,840
okay I take I have no idea if it was
 

3929
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:46,629
okay I take I have no idea if it was
intended this way and so I'm just

3930
01:17:46,629 --> 01:17:46,639
intended this way and so I'm just
 

3931
01:17:46,639 --> 01:17:48,910
intended this way and so I'm just
interpreting it a way I like the

3932
01:17:48,910 --> 01:17:48,920
interpreting it a way I like the
 

3933
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:51,390
interpreting it a way I like the

01:17:59,550 --> 01:17:59,560
sacred to me I have a reverence for
 

3941
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:01,910
sacred to me I have a reverence for
reality but I know my best understanding

complete I know my best model of it is a
 

3947
01:18:07,639 --> 01:18:10,750
complete I know my best model of it is a
model where I tried to make some kind of

3948
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:10,760
model where I tried to make some kind of
 

3949
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,910
model where I tried to make some kind of
predictive capacity by reducing the

3950
01:18:12,910 --> 01:18:12,920
predictive capacity by reducing the
 

3951
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:14,830
predictive capacity by reducing the
complexity of it to a set of stuff that

3952
01:18:14,830 --> 01:18:14,840
complexity of it to a set of stuff that
 

3953
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,709
complexity of it to a set of stuff that
I could observe and then a subset of

3954
01:18:16,709 --> 01:18:16,719
I could observe and then a subset of
 

3955
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:18,270
I could observe and then a subset of
that stuff that I thought was the causal

01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:20,110
that stuff that I thought was the causal
Dynamics and then some set of you know

3958
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:20,120
Dynamics and then some set of you know
 

3959
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:22,310
Dynamics and then some set of you know
mechanisms that are involved and what we

01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:22,320
mechanisms that are involved and what we
 

3961
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,550
mechanisms that are involved and what we
find is that

3962
01:18:23,550 --> 01:18:23,560
find is that
 

3963
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:25,430
find is that
it can be super useful like Newtonian

it can be super useful like Newtonian
gravity can help us do ballistic curves

and all kinds of super useful stuff and
 

3969
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,510
and all kinds of super useful stuff and
then we get to the place where it

3970
01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:31,520
then we get to the place where it
 

3971
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,870
then we get to the place where it
doesn't explain what's happening at a

3977
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:42,830

uh we excluded stuff and it also doesn't

uh we excluded stuff and it also doesn't
 

3979

of a circuit board and the circuit board
 

4003
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:07,950
of a circuit board and the circuit board
are the same thing but I would argue

are the same thing but I would argue
 

4005
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:09,229
are the same thing but I would argue
that the model of a cell and the cell

that the model of a cell and the cell

are not the same

are not the same

01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:33,070
be in the unknown unknown set where we
keep finding like oh it's just the

4078
01:20:33,070 --> 01:20:33,080
keep finding like oh it's just the
 

4079
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:34,470
keep finding like oh it's just the
genome oh well now it's the genome and

4080
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:34,480
genome oh well now it's the genome and
 

4081
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,030
genome oh well now it's the genome and
the epigenome and then a recursive

4082
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:36,040
the epigenome and then a recursive
 

4083
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,390
the epigenome and then a recursive
change on the epigenome because of the

4084
01:20:37,390 --> 01:20:37,400
change on the epigenome because of the
 

4085
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:38,790
change on the epigenome because of the
proteome and then there's mitochondrial

4086
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:38,800
proteome and then there's mitochondrial
 

4087
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:41,470
proteome and then there's mitochondrial
DNA and then virus is affected and [\h__\h]

4088
01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:41,480
DNA and then virus is affected and [\h__\h]
 

4089
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:43,870
DNA and then virus is affected and [\h__\h]
right so it's like we get OV excited

4090
01:20:43,870 --> 01:20:43,880
right so it's like we get OV excited
 

4091
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:45,590
right so it's like we get OV excited
when we think we found the

when we think we found the

01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,750
when we think we found the
thing so on Facebook you know how you

4094
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:47,760
thing so on Facebook you know how you
 

4095
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,030

01:20:56,470 --> 01:20:56,480
description you uh self-terminating is a
 

4103
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,070
description you uh self-terminating is a
really interesting idea that you talk

4104
01:20:58,070 --> 01:20:58,080
really interesting idea that you talk
 

4105
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,229
really interesting idea that you talk
about quite a

4106
01:21:00,229 --> 01:21:00,239
about quite a
 

4107
01:21:00,239 --> 01:21:02,110
about quite a
bit first of all what is a

4108
01:21:02,110 --> 01:21:02,120
bit first of all what is a
 

4109
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:05,870
bit first of all what is a
self-terminating system and I think you

4110
01:21:05,870 --> 01:21:05,880
self-terminating system and I think you
 

4111
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:08,550
self-terminating system and I think you
have a sense correct me if I'm wrong

4112
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:08,560
have a sense correct me if I'm wrong
 

4113
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:11,149
have a sense correct me if I'm wrong
that human civilization as it currently

4114
01:21:11,149 --> 01:21:11,159
that human civilization as it currently
 

4115
01:21:11,159 --> 01:21:15,070
that human civilization as it currently
is is a self-terminating

4116
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:15,080

 

4117
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:17,629

system why do you have that intuition

4118
01:21:17,629 --> 01:21:17,639
system why do you have that intuition
 

4119
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:19,030
system why do you have that intuition
combined with the definition of what

4120
01:21:19,030 --> 01:21:19,040
combined with the definition of what
 

4121
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,629
combined with the definition of what
self self-terminating

4122
01:21:21,629 --> 01:21:21,639
self self-terminating
 

4123
01:21:21,639 --> 01:21:25,229
self self-terminating
means okay so if we look

4124
01:21:25,229 --> 01:21:25,239
means okay so if we look
 

4125
01:21:25,239 --> 01:21:30,270
means okay so if we look
at human societies historically human

4126
01:21:30,270 --> 01:21:30,280
at human societies historically human
 

4127
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:33,390
at human societies historically human
civilizations uh it's not that hard to

4128
01:21:33,390 --> 01:21:33,400
civilizations uh it's not that hard to
 

4129
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:35,070
civilizations uh it's not that hard to
realize that most of the major

4130
01:21:35,070 --> 01:21:35,080
realize that most of the major
 

4131
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:36,669
realize that most of the major
civilizations and empires of the past

4132
01:21:36,669 --> 01:21:36,679
civilizations and empires of the past
 

4133
01:21:36,679 --> 01:21:38,470
civilizations and empires of the past
don't exist anymore so they had a life

4134
01:21:38,470 --> 01:21:38,480
don't exist anymore so they had a life
 

4135
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,750
don't exist anymore so they had a life
cycle they died for some reason so we

4136
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:40,760
cycle they died for some reason so we
 

4137
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:43,590
cycle they died for some reason so we
don't still have an the early Egyptian

4138
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:43,600
don't still have an the early Egyptian
 

4139
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,149
don't still have an the early Egyptian
Empire or Inca or Maya or Aztec or any

4140
01:21:46,149 --> 01:21:46,159
Empire or Inca or Maya or Aztec or any
 

4141
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:47,870
Empire or Inca or Maya or Aztec or any
of those right and

4142
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:47,880
of those right and
 

4143
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:50,870
of those right and
so they they terminated sometimes it

4144
01:21:50,870 --> 01:21:50,880
so they they terminated sometimes it
 

4145
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,110
so they they terminated sometimes it
seems like they were terminated from the

4146
01:21:52,110 --> 01:21:52,120
seems like they were terminated from the
 

4147
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:53,709
seems like they were terminated from the
outside and War sometimes it seems like

4148
01:21:53,709 --> 01:21:53,719
outside and War sometimes it seems like
 

4149
01:21:53,719 --> 01:21:54,790
outside and War sometimes it seems like
they self-terminated when we look at

4150
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:54,800
they self-terminated when we look at
 

4151
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:57,390
they self-terminated when we look at
Easter Island it was a self termination

4152
01:21:57,390 --> 01:21:57,400
Easter Island it was a self termination
 

4153
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,750
Easter Island it was a self termination
um so uh let's go ahead and take an

4154
01:21:59,750 --> 01:21:59,760
um so uh let's go ahead and take an
 

4155
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,750
um so uh let's go ahead and take an
island situation if I have an island and

4156
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:01,760
island situation if I have an island and
 

4157
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,430
island situation if I have an island and
we are consuming the resources on that

4158
01:22:03,430 --> 01:22:03,440
we are consuming the resources on that
 

4159
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:05,310
we are consuming the resources on that
island faster than the resources can

4160
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:05,320
island faster than the resources can
 

4161
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:06,470
island faster than the resources can
replicate themselves and there's a

4162
01:22:06,470 --> 01:22:06,480
replicate themselves and there's a
 

4163
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,990
replicate themselves and there's a
finite space there that system is going

4164
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:09,000
finite space there that system is going
 

4165
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,270
finite space there that system is going
to self-terminate it's not going to be

4166
01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:10,280
to self-terminate it's not going to be
 

4167
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:12,110
to self-terminate it's not going to be
able to keep doing that thing because

4168
01:22:12,110 --> 01:22:12,120
able to keep doing that thing because
 

4169
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,669
able to keep doing that thing because
you'll get to a place of there's no

4170
01:22:13,669 --> 01:22:13,679
you'll get to a place of there's no
 

4171
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:17,590
you'll get to a place of there's no
resources left and then you get uh so

4172
01:22:17,590 --> 01:22:17,600
resources left and then you get uh so
 

4173
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,629
resources left and then you get uh so
now if I'm utilizing the resources

4174
01:22:19,629 --> 01:22:19,639
now if I'm utilizing the resources
 

4175
01:22:19,639 --> 01:22:22,189
now if I'm utilizing the resources
faster than they can replicate or faster

4176
01:22:22,189 --> 01:22:22,199
faster than they can replicate or faster
 

4177
01:22:22,199 --> 01:22:24,189
faster than they can replicate or faster
than they can replenish and I'm actually

4178
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:24,199
than they can replenish and I'm actually
 

4179
01:22:24,199 --> 01:22:25,790
than they can replenish and I'm actually
growing our population in the process so

4180
01:22:25,790 --> 01:22:25,800
growing our population in the process so
 

4181
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,430
growing our population in the process so
I'm even increasing the rate of the

4182
01:22:27,430 --> 01:22:27,440
I'm even increasing the rate of the
 

4183
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:28,910
I'm even increasing the rate of the
utilization of

4184
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:28,920
utilization of
 

4185
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:31,189
utilization of
resources I might get an exponential

4186
01:22:31,189 --> 01:22:31,199
resources I might get an exponential
 

4187
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:32,870
resources I might get an exponential
curve and then hit a wall and then just

4188
01:22:32,870 --> 01:22:32,880
curve and then hit a wall and then just
 

4189
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,990
curve and then hit a wall and then just
collapse the exponential curve rather

4190
01:22:34,990 --> 01:22:35,000
collapse the exponential curve rather
 

4191
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,510
collapse the exponential curve rather
than do an S curve or some other kind of

4192
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:37,520
than do an S curve or some other kind of
 

4193
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:41,669
than do an S curve or some other kind of
thing um so self-terminating system is

4194
01:22:41,669 --> 01:22:41,679
thing um so self-terminating system is
 

4195
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:45,470
thing um so self-terminating system is
any system that depends upon a substrate

4196
01:22:45,470 --> 01:22:45,480
any system that depends upon a substrate
 

4197
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:47,550
any system that depends upon a substrate
system that is debasing its own

4198
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:47,560
system that is debasing its own
 

4199
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:49,550
system that is debasing its own
substrate that is debasing what it

4200
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:49,560
substrate that is debasing what it
 

4201
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:53,070
substrate that is debasing what it
depends upon so you're right that uh

4202
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:53,080
depends upon so you're right that uh
 

4203
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:55,510
depends upon so you're right that uh
if you look at Empires they rise and

4204
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:55,520
if you look at Empires they rise and
 

4205
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:58,310
if you look at Empires they rise and
fall throughout human history but but

4206
01:22:58,310 --> 01:22:58,320
fall throughout human history but but
 

4207
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:00,870
fall throughout human history but but
not this time bro

4208
01:23:00,870 --> 01:23:00,880
not this time bro
 

4209
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:03,669
not this time bro
we're this one's going to last forever

4210
01:23:03,669 --> 01:23:03,679
we're this one's going to last forever
 

4211
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:06,990
we're this one's going to last forever
that's I like that idea I think that if

4212
01:23:06,990 --> 01:23:07,000
that's I like that idea I think that if
 

4213
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,550
that's I like that idea I think that if
we don't understand why all the previous

4214
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:08,560
we don't understand why all the previous
 

4215
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,110
we don't understand why all the previous
ones failed we can't ensure that and so

4216
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:11,120
ones failed we can't ensure that and so
 

4217
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,270
ones failed we can't ensure that and so
I think it's very important to

4218
01:23:12,270 --> 01:23:12,280
I think it's very important to
 

4219
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:14,030
I think it's very important to
understand it well so that we can have

4220
01:23:14,030 --> 01:23:14,040
understand it well so that we can have
 

4221
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:17,350
understand it well so that we can have
that be a designed outcome with somewhat

4222
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:17,360
that be a designed outcome with somewhat
 

4223
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:20,390
that be a designed outcome with somewhat
decent probability so where it's sort of

4224
01:23:20,390 --> 01:23:20,400
decent probability so where it's sort of
 

4225
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,070
decent probability so where it's sort of
in terms of consuming the resources on

4226
01:23:22,070 --> 01:23:22,080
in terms of consuming the resources on
 

4227
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,590
in terms of consuming the resources on
the island and we're a clever bunch and

4228
01:23:24,590 --> 01:23:24,600
the island and we're a clever bunch and
 

4229
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:26,430
the island and we're a clever bunch and
we keep coming

4230
01:23:26,430 --> 01:23:26,440
we keep coming
 

4231
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:30,830
we keep coming
up especially when the on the horizon

4232
01:23:30,830 --> 01:23:30,840
up especially when the on the horizon
 

4233
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:34,070
up especially when the on the horizon
there is a a termination point we keep

4234
01:23:34,070 --> 01:23:34,080
there is a a termination point we keep
 

4235
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,350
there is a a termination point we keep
coming up with clever ways of avoiding

4236
01:23:36,350 --> 01:23:36,360
coming up with clever ways of avoiding
 

4237
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:39,550
coming up with clever ways of avoiding
disaster of avoiding collapse of

01:23:39,550 --> 01:23:39,560
disaster of avoiding collapse of

coming up with different ways to improve

4244
01:23:45,510 --> 01:23:45,520
coming up with different ways to improve
 

4245
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,510
coming up with different ways to improve
productivity and the way Society

4246

functions such that we consume less

4248
01:23:49,550 --> 01:23:49,560
functions such that we consume less
 

4249
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,149
functions such that we consume less
resources or get a lot more from the

4250
01:23:51,149 --> 01:23:51,159
resources or get a lot more from the

01:23:51,159 --> 01:23:53,910
resources or get a lot more from the
resources we have

01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:58,229
resources we have
so there's some sense in which there's a

4254
01:23:58,229 --> 01:23:58,239
so there's some sense in which there's a

so there's some sense in which there's a
human Ingenuity is a source for optimism

01:24:01,709 --> 01:24:01,719
human Ingenuity is a source for optimism
 

4257
01:24:01,719 --> 01:24:03,149
human Ingenuity is a source for optimism
about the future of this particular

4258
01:24:03,149 --> 01:24:03,159

technology can't not result in our
 

4345
01:25:46,239 --> 01:25:47,669
technology can't not result in our
self-termination so we have to take it

4346
01:25:47,669 --> 01:25:47,679
self-termination so we have to take it
 

4347
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:51,350
self-termination so we have to take it
out before it gets any further um but

4348
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:51,360
out before it gets any further um but
 

4349
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,030
out before it gets any further um but
also if you read a lot out of the X risk

4350
01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:53,040
also if you read a lot out of the X risk

01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,910
Community you know Bostrom and Friends
uh it's like our total number of

4354
01:25:58,910 --> 01:25:58,920
uh it's like our total number of
 

4355
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:01,030
uh it's like our total number of
existential risks and the total

4356
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:01,040
existential risks and the total
 

4357
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,709
existential risks and the total
probability of them is going

4358
01:26:02,709 --> 01:26:02,719
probability of them is going
 

4359
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:07,310
probability of them is going
up and so I think that there are we have

4360
01:26:07,310 --> 01:26:07,320
up and so I think that there are we have
 

4361
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:11,149
up and so I think that there are we have
to hold together where our positive

4362
01:26:11,149 --> 01:26:11,159
to hold together where our positive
 

4363
01:26:11,159 --> 01:26:13,109
to hold together where our positive
possibilities and our risk possibilities

4364
01:26:13,109 --> 01:26:13,119
possibilities and our risk possibilities
 

4365
01:26:13,119 --> 01:26:15,870
possibilities and our risk possibilities
are both increasing and then say for the

4366
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:15,880
are both increasing and then say for the
 

4367
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:17,990
are both increasing and then say for the
positive possibilities to be realized

4368
01:26:17,990 --> 01:26:18,000
positive possibilities to be realized
 

4369
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,470

longterm all of the catastrophic risks
 

4371
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:22,950
longterm all of the catastrophic risks
have to not happen any of the

4372
01:26:22,950 --> 01:26:22,960
have to not happen any of the
 

4373
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,910
have to not happen any of the
catastrophic risks happening is enough

4374
01:26:24,910 --> 01:26:24,920
catastrophic risks happening is enough
 

4375
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:26,590
catastrophic risks happening is enough
to keep that positive outcome from

4376
01:26:26,590 --> 01:26:26,600
to keep that positive outcome from
 

4377
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,149
to keep that positive outcome from
occurring so how do we ensure that none

4378
01:26:29,149 --> 01:26:29,159
occurring so how do we ensure that none
 

4379
01:26:29,159 --> 01:26:31,270
occurring so how do we ensure that none
of them happen if we want to say let's

4380
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:31,280
of them happen if we want to say let's

4418
01:27:14,070 --> 01:27:14,080
like a 2,000-year old clock right like
 

4419
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:16,990
like a 2,000-year old clock right like
like metal gears

4420
01:27:16,990 --> 01:27:17,000
like metal gears
 

4421
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,229
like metal gears
and does that mean we lost like, 1500

4422
01:27:20,229 --> 01:27:20,239
and does that mean we lost like, 1500
 

4423
01:27:20,239 --> 01:27:23,750
and does that mean we lost like, 1500
years of technological progress um and

4424
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:23,760
years of technological progress um and
 

4425
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:25,590
years of technological progress um and
from a society that was relatively

4426
01:27:25,590 --> 01:27:25,600
from a society that was relatively
 

4427
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:28,350
from a society that was relatively
technologically advanced

4428
01:27:28,350 --> 01:27:28,360
technologically advanced
 

4429
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:31,830
technologically advanced
um so what I'm interested in here is

4430
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:31,840
um so what I'm interested in here is
 

4431
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,510
um so what I'm interested in here is
being able to say okay

4432
01:27:33,510 --> 01:27:33,520
being able to say okay
 

4433
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:36,910
being able to say okay
well why did previous societies

4434
01:27:36,910 --> 01:27:36,920
well why did previous societies
 

4435
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:40,030
well why did previous societies
fail can we understand that abstractly

4436
01:27:40,030 --> 01:27:40,040
fail can we understand that abstractly
 

4437
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:41,590
fail can we understand that abstractly
enough that we

4438
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:41,600
enough that we
 

4439
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,629
enough that we
can make a civilizational model that

4440
01:27:44,629 --> 01:27:44,639
can make a civilizational model that
 

4441
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:46,669
can make a civilizational model that
isn't just trying to solve one type of

4442
01:27:46,669 --> 01:27:46,679
isn't just trying to solve one type of
 

4443
01:27:46,679 --> 01:27:48,830
isn't just trying to solve one type of
failure but solve the underlying things

4444
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:48,840
failure but solve the underlying things
 

4445
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:51,390
failure but solve the underlying things
that generate the failures as a whole

4446
01:27:51,390 --> 01:27:51,400
that generate the failures as a whole
 

4447
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:52,990
that generate the failures as a whole
are there some underlying generator

4448
01:27:52,990 --> 01:27:53,000
are there some underlying generator
 

4449
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,590
are there some underlying generator
functions or patterns that would make a

4450
01:27:55,590 --> 01:27:55,600
functions or patterns that would make a
 

4451
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,910
functions or patterns that would make a
system self-terminating and can we solve

4452
01:27:57,910 --> 01:27:57,920
system self-terminating and can we solve
 

4453
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:59,270
system self-terminating and can we solve
those and have that be the kernel of a

4454
01:27:59,270 --> 01:27:59,280
those and have that be the kernel of a
 

4455
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:00,830
those and have that be the kernel of a
new civilizational model that is not

4456
01:28:00,830 --> 01:28:00,840
new civilizational model that is not
 

4457
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:02,149
new civilizational model that is not
self-terminating

4458
01:28:02,149 --> 01:28:02,159
self-terminating
 

4459
01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:04,910
self-terminating
and can we then be able to actually look

4460
01:28:04,910 --> 01:28:04,920
and can we then be able to actually look
 

4461
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:06,750
and can we then be able to actually look
at the categories of XIs we're aware of

4462
01:28:06,750 --> 01:28:06,760
at the categories of XIs we're aware of
 

4463
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:09,070
at the categories of XIs we're aware of
and see that we actually have resilience

4464
01:28:09,070 --> 01:28:09,080
and see that we actually have resilience
 

4465
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:10,590
and see that we actually have resilience
in the presence of those not just

4466
01:28:10,590 --> 01:28:10,600
in the presence of those not just
 

4467
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:11,870
in the presence of those not just
resilience but anti

4468
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:11,880
resilience but anti
 

4469
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:14,790
resilience but anti
fragility and I would say for the

4470
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:14,800
fragility and I would say for the
 

4471
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:17,430
fragility and I would say for the
optimism to be grounded it has to

4472
01:28:17,430 --> 01:28:17,440
optimism to be grounded it has to
 

4473
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:19,229
optimism to be grounded it has to
actually be able to understand the risk

4474
01:28:19,229 --> 01:28:19,239
actually be able to understand the risk
 

4475
01:28:19,239 --> 01:28:21,350
actually be able to understand the risk
space well and have adequate solutions

4476
01:28:21,350 --> 01:28:21,360
space well and have adequate solutions
 

4477
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:24,669
space well and have adequate solutions
for it so can we try

4478
01:28:24,669 --> 01:28:24,679
for it so can we try
 

4479
01:28:24,679 --> 01:28:27,990
for it so can we try
to dig into some basic intuitions about

4480
01:28:27,990 --> 01:28:28,000
to dig into some basic intuitions about
 

4481
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:31,149
to dig into some basic intuitions about
the underlying sources of uh

4482
01:28:31,149 --> 01:28:31,159
the underlying sources of uh
 

4483
01:28:31,159 --> 01:28:33,350
the underlying sources of uh
catastrophic failures of the system and

4484
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:33,360
catastrophic failures of the system and
 

4485
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:35,870
catastrophic failures of the system and
over consumption that's built in into

4486
01:28:35,870 --> 01:28:35,880
over consumption that's built in into
 

4487
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:37,830
over consumption that's built in into
self-terminating systems so both the

4488
01:28:37,830 --> 01:28:37,840
self-terminating systems so both the
 

4489
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:40,109
self-terminating systems so both the
overc consumption which is like the slow

4490
01:28:40,109 --> 01:28:40,119
overc consumption which is like the slow
 

4491
01:28:40,119 --> 01:28:42,390
overc consumption which is like the slow
death and then then there's the fast

4492
01:28:42,390 --> 01:28:42,400
death and then then there's the fast
 

4493
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,709
death and then then there's the fast
death of nuclear war and all those kinds

4494
01:28:44,709 --> 01:28:44,719
death of nuclear war and all those kinds
 

4495
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:48,189

I would be podcasting all about the

I would be podcasting all about the
 

4517
01:29:11,719 --> 01:29:14,550
I would be podcasting all about the
negative consequences but but when I go

4518
01:29:14,550 --> 01:29:14,560
negative consequences but but when I go
 

4519
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:17,790
negative consequences but but when I go
back home I'd be I just in my heart know

but what's can we start to pull it a

we want to put to it that seems to be

01:29:57,669 --> 01:29:57,679
we want to put to it that seems to be

01:29:57,679 --> 01:29:59,390
we want to put to it that seems to be

01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:06,629
try to figure out how to construct non-
self-terminating systems so what what

4560
01:30:06,629 --> 01:30:06,639
self-terminating systems so what what
 

4561
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:08,629
self-terminating systems so what what
are some underlying sources

4562
01:30:08,629 --> 01:30:08,639
are some underlying sources
 

4563
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:11,830
are some underlying sources
yeah first I have to say um

4564
01:30:11,830 --> 01:30:11,840
yeah first I have to say um
 

4565
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:15,030
yeah first I have to say um
I I actually really respect Drexler for

4566
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:15,040
I I actually really respect Drexler for

01:30:22,149 --> 01:30:22,159
back in the day um to make sure the
 

4571
01:30:22,159 --> 01:30:23,790
back in the day um to make sure the
world was paying adequate attention to

4572
01:30:23,790 --> 01:30:23,800
world was paying adequate attention to
 

4573
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:26,430
world was paying adequate attention to

advantage to those who focus on the

advantage to those who focus on the

opportunities and don't focus on the
 

4585
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:41,149

4638
01:31:37,790 --> 01:31:37,800
risk that will help us kind of
 

4639
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:42,189

um make concrete the the the discussion

4640
01:31:42,189 --> 01:31:42,199
um make concrete the the the discussion
 

4641
01:31:42,199 --> 01:31:43,830
um make concrete the the the discussion
we're having about how to fix this whole

we're having about how to fix this whole
 

4643
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:46,629
we're having about how to fix this whole
thing yeah I think it's worth taking a

4644
01:31:46,629 --> 01:31:46,639
thing yeah I think it's worth taking a
 

4645
01:31:46,639 --> 01:31:48,669
thing yeah I think it's worth taking a
historical perspective briefly to just

historical perspective briefly to just
 

4647

historical perspective briefly to just
kind of Orient everyone to it we don't

4648
01:31:50,270 --> 01:31:50,280
kind of Orient everyone to it we don't
 

4649
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:53,109
kind of Orient everyone to it we don't
have to um go all the way back to the

4650
01:31:53,109 --> 01:31:53,119
have to um go all the way back to the
 

4651
01:31:53,119 --> 01:31:54,910
have to um go all the way back to the
aliens who've seen all of civilization

4652
01:31:54,910 --> 01:31:54,920
aliens who've seen all of civilization
 

4653
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:58,950
aliens who've seen all of civilization
but to just recognize that um for all of

4654
01:31:58,950 --> 01:31:58,960
but to just recognize that um for all of
 

4655
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:01,709
but to just recognize that um for all of
human history as far as we're

4656
01:32:01,709 --> 01:32:01,719
human history as far as we're
 

4657
01:32:01,719 --> 01:32:04,870
human history as far as we're
aware there were existential risks to

4658
01:32:04,870 --> 01:32:04,880
aware there were existential risks to
 

4659
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:07,270
aware there were existential risks to
civilizations and they happened right

4660
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:07,280
civilizations and they happened right
 

4661
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:08,950
civilizations and they happened right
like there were civilizations that were

4662
01:32:08,950 --> 01:32:08,960
like there were civilizations that were
 

4663
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:12,310
like there were civilizations that were
killed in war um that tribes that were

4664
01:32:12,310 --> 01:32:12,320
killed in war um that tribes that were
 

4665
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,550
killed in war um that tribes that were
killed in tribal Warfare whatever so uh

4666
01:32:14,550 --> 01:32:14,560
killed in tribal Warfare whatever so uh
 

4667
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,070
killed in tribal Warfare whatever so uh
people faced existential RIS to the

4668
01:32:16,070 --> 01:32:16,080
people faced existential RIS to the
 

4669
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:18,189
people faced existential RIS to the
group that they identified with it's

01:32:18,189 --> 01:32:18,199
group that they identified with it's
 

4671
01:32:18,199 --> 01:32:20,189
group that they identified with it's
just those were local phenomena right

4672
01:32:20,189 --> 01:32:20,199
just those were local phenomena right
 

4673
01:32:20,199 --> 01:32:21,870
just those were local phenomena right
they it wasn't a fully global phenomen

4674
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:21,880
they it wasn't a fully global phenomen
 

4675
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:24,149
they it wasn't a fully global phenomen
so an Empire could fall and surrounding

01:32:24,149 --> 01:32:24,159
so an Empire could fall and surrounding
 

4677
01:32:24,159 --> 01:32:25,950
so an Empire could fall and surrounding
Empires didn't fall maybe they came in

um the first time that we were able to

01:32:32,830 --> 01:32:32,840
um the first time that we were able to
 

4685
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:35,149
um the first time that we were able to
think about catastrophic risk not from

4686
01:32:35,149 --> 01:32:35,159
think about catastrophic risk not from
 

4687
01:32:35,159 --> 01:32:36,590
think about catastrophic risk not from
like a solar flare or something that we

4688
01:32:36,590 --> 01:32:36,600
like a solar flare or something that we
 

4689
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:38,229
like a solar flare or something that we
couldn't control but from something that

4690
01:32:38,229 --> 01:32:38,239
couldn't control but from something that
 

4691
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:40,189
couldn't control but from something that
humans would actually create at a global

01:32:40,189 --> 01:32:40,199
humans would actually create at a global
 

4693
01:32:40,199 --> 01:32:42,830
humans would actually create at a global
level was World War II and the bomb

4694
01:32:42,830 --> 01:32:42,840
level was World War II and the bomb
 

4695
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:43,990
level was World War II and the bomb
because it was the first time that we

4696
01:32:43,990 --> 01:32:44,000
because it was the first time that we
 

4697
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,030
because it was the first time that we
had Tech big enough that could actually

4698
01:32:47,030 --> 01:32:47,040
had Tech big enough that could actually
 

4699
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:48,750
had Tech big enough that could actually
mess up everything at a global level it

4700
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:48,760
mess up everything at a global level it
 

4701
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:50,229
mess up everything at a global level it
could mess up habitability we just

4702
01:32:50,229 --> 01:32:50,239
could mess up habitability we just
 

4703
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:51,910
could mess up habitability we just
weren't powerful enough to do that

4704
01:32:51,910 --> 01:32:51,920
weren't powerful enough to do that
 

4705
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:54,189
weren't powerful enough to do that
before it's not that we didn't behave in

4706
01:32:54,189 --> 01:32:54,199
before it's not that we didn't behave in
 

4707
01:32:54,199 --> 01:32:56,030
before it's not that we didn't behave in
ways that would have done it we just

4708
01:32:56,030 --> 01:32:56,040
ways that would have done it we just
 

4709
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:57,550
ways that would have done it we just
only behaved in those ways at the scale

4710
01:32:57,550 --> 01:32:57,560
only behaved in those ways at the scale
 

4711
01:32:57,560 --> 01:33:00,790
only behaved in those ways at the scale
we could affect and so it's important to

4712
01:33:00,790 --> 01:33:00,800
we could affect and so it's important to
 

4713
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,629
we could affect and so it's important to
get that there's the entire world before

4714
01:33:02,629 --> 01:33:02,639
get that there's the entire world before
 

4715
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:05,310
get that there's the entire world before
World War II where we don't have the

4716
01:33:05,310 --> 01:33:05,320
World War II where we don't have the
 

4717
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:06,750
World War II where we don't have the
ability to make a non-habitable

4718
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:06,760
ability to make a non-habitable
 

4719
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:09,390
ability to make a non-habitable
biosphere non-habitable for us and then

4720
01:33:09,390 --> 01:33:09,400
biosphere non-habitable for us and then
 

4721
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:11,510
biosphere non-habitable for us and then
there's World War II and the beginning

4722
01:33:11,510 --> 01:33:11,520
there's World War II and the beginning
 

4723
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:14,189
there's World War II and the beginning
of a completely new phase where Global

4724
01:33:14,189 --> 01:33:14,199
of a completely new phase where Global
 

4725
01:33:14,199 --> 01:33:16,830
of a completely new phase where Global
human induced catastrophic risk is now a

4726
01:33:16,830 --> 01:33:16,840
human induced catastrophic risk is now a
 

4727
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:19,709
human induced catastrophic risk is now a
real thing and that was such a big deal

4728
01:33:19,709 --> 01:33:19,719
real thing and that was such a big deal
 

4729
01:33:19,719 --> 01:33:21,709
real thing and that was such a big deal
that it changed the entire world in a

4730
01:33:21,709 --> 01:33:21,719
that it changed the entire world in a
 

4731
01:33:21,719 --> 01:33:25,070
that it changed the entire world in a
really fundamental way which is you know

01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:26,189
and was the idea of globalization since
we could have Global effects we needed

4840
01:35:26,189 --> 01:35:26,199
we could have Global effects we needed
 

4841
01:35:26,199 --> 01:35:27,310
we could have Global effects we needed
to be able to think about things

4842
01:35:27,310 --> 01:35:27,320
to be able to think about things
 

4843
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:29,149
to be able to think about things
globally where we had trade

4844
01:35:29,149 --> 01:35:29,159
globally where we had trade
 

4845
01:35:29,159 --> 01:35:30,550
globally where we had trade
relationships with each other where it

4846
01:35:30,550 --> 01:35:30,560
relationships with each other where it
 

4847
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:33,030
relationships with each other where it
would not be profitable to war with each

4848
01:35:33,030 --> 01:35:33,040
would not be profitable to war with each
 

4849
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:34,550
would not be profitable to war with each
other it' be more profitable to actually

4850
01:35:34,550 --> 01:35:34,560
other it' be more profitable to actually
 

4851
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:36,030
other it' be more profitable to actually
be able to trade with each other so our

4852
01:35:36,030 --> 01:35:36,040
be able to trade with each other so our
 

4853
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:37,950
be able to trade with each other so our
own self-interest was you know going to

4854
01:35:37,950 --> 01:35:37,960
own self-interest was you know going to
 

4855
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:40,070
own self-interest was you know going to
drive our non-war

4856
01:35:40,070 --> 01:35:40,080
drive our non-war
 

4857
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:43,590
drive our non-war
interest um and so this started to look

4858
01:35:43,590 --> 01:35:43,600
interest um and so this started to look
 

4859
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,669
interest um and so this started to look
like and obviously this this couldn't

4860
01:35:45,669 --> 01:35:45,679
like and obviously this this couldn't
 

4861
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:47,590
like and obviously this this couldn't
have happened that much earlier either

4862
01:35:47,590 --> 01:35:47,600
have happened that much earlier either
 

4863
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,149
have happened that much earlier either
because industrialization hadn't gotten

could do that kind of trade and create
 

4893
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:19,750
could do that kind of trade and create
massive GDP growth we could all work

01:36:19,750 --> 01:36:19,760
massive GDP growth we could all work
 

4895
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:21,390

boundaries faster the unrenewable use of
 

4923
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:52,590

Mining and all those types of things
 

4941
01:37:11,719 --> 01:37:13,750
Mining and all those types of things
that's the over consumption side of the

4942
01:37:13,750 --> 01:37:13,760
that's the over consumption side of the
 

4943
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:15,590
that's the over consumption side of the
of the risk that we're talking about and

01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:15,600
of the risk that we're talking about and
 

4945
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:18,950
of the risk that we're talking about and
so the answer of let's do positive GDP

4946
01:37:18,950 --> 01:37:18,960
so the answer of let's do positive GDP
 

4947
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:19,870
so the answer of let's do positive GDP
is the

4948
01:37:19,870 --> 01:37:19,880
is the
 

4949
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:24,030
is the
answer rapid and exponentially obviously

you have to have growth of goods and
 

5005
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:20,310
you have to have growth of goods and

these Supply chains that are so
 

5013
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,270
these Supply chains that are so
interconnected across the world you get

5014
01:38:29,270 --> 01:38:29,280
interconnected across the world you get
 

5015
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:31,390

so we got to see with coid and an issue
 

5025

01:39:05,350 --> 01:39:05,360
they don't produce that is shipped into
 

5049
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:06,870
they don't produce that is shipped into
them and depend upon pesticides they

5050
01:39:06,870 --> 01:39:06,880
them and depend upon pesticides they
 

5051
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,870
them and depend upon pesticides they
don't produce so we got both crop

5052
01:39:08,870 --> 01:39:08,880
don't produce so we got both crop
 

5053
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:10,629
don't produce so we got both crop
failures and crops being eaten by

5054
01:39:10,629 --> 01:39:10,639
failures and crops being eaten by
 

5055
01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:12,750
failures and crops being eaten by
locusts in scale in Northern Africa and

5056
01:39:12,750 --> 01:39:12,760
locusts in scale in Northern Africa and
 

5057
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:14,070
locusts in scale in Northern Africa and
Iran and things like that because they

5058
01:39:14,070 --> 01:39:14,080
Iran and things like that because they
 

5059
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:15,550
Iran and things like that because they
couldn't get the supplies of stuff in so

5060
01:39:15,550 --> 01:39:15,560
couldn't get the supplies of stuff in so
 

5061
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:17,510
couldn't get the supplies of stuff in so
then you get massive starvation or

5062
01:39:17,510 --> 01:39:17,520
then you get massive starvation or
 

5063
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:20,229
then you get massive starvation or
future kind of hunger issues because of

5064
01:39:20,229 --> 01:39:20,239
future kind of hunger issues because of
 

5065
01:39:20,239 --> 01:39:22,629
future kind of hunger issues because of
supply chain shut Downs so you get this

5066
01:39:22,629 --> 01:39:22,639
supply chain shut Downs so you get this
 

5067
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:24,950
supply chain shut Downs so you get this
increased fragility in Cascade Dynamics

5068
01:39:24,950 --> 01:39:24,960
increased fragility in Cascade Dynamics
 

5069
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:26,709
increased fragility in Cascade Dynamics
where a small problem can end up leading

and also we went from two superpowers

5076
01:39:34,109 --> 01:39:34,119
and also we went from two superpowers
 

5077
01:39:34,119 --> 01:39:36,070
and also we went from two superpowers
with one catastrophe

5078
01:39:36,070 --> 01:39:36,080
with one catastrophe
 

5079
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:37,990

now that same catastrophe weapon is
 

5083
01:39:42,159 --> 01:39:44,510
now that same catastrophe weapon is
there's more countries that have it

5084
01:39:44,510 --> 01:39:44,520
there's more countries that have it
 

5085
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:47,070
there's more countries that have it
eight or nine countries that have it and

5086
01:39:47,070 --> 01:39:47,080
eight or nine countries that have it and
 

5087
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:49,229
eight or nine countries that have it and
there's a lot more types of catastrophe

5088
01:39:49,229 --> 01:39:49,239
there's a lot more types of catastrophe
 

5089
01:39:49,239 --> 01:39:51,430
there's a lot more types of catastrophe
weapons we now have cat catastrophe

5090
01:39:51,430 --> 01:39:51,440
weapons we now have cat catastrophe
 

5091
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:53,750
weapons we now have cat catastrophe
weapons with weaponized drones that can

in fact every new type of tech has

5096
01:39:57,830 --> 01:39:57,840
in fact every new type of tech has
 

5097
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:01,390
in fact every new type of tech has
created an arms race so we have not with

5098
01:40:01,390 --> 01:40:01,400
created an arms race so we have not with
 

5099
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:02,750
created an arms race so we have not with
the UN or the other kind of

5100
01:40:02,750 --> 01:40:02,760
the UN or the other kind of
 

5101
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:04,189
the UN or the other kind of
intergovernmental organizations we

5102
01:40:04,189 --> 01:40:04,199
intergovernmental organizations we
 

5103
01:40:04,199 --> 01:40:05,830
intergovernmental organizations we
haven't been able to really do nuclear

5104
01:40:05,830 --> 01:40:05,840
haven't been able to really do nuclear
 

5105
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:08,589
haven't been able to really do nuclear
de proliferation we've actually had more

5106
01:40:08,589 --> 01:40:08,599
de proliferation we've actually had more
 

5107
01:40:08,599 --> 01:40:10,430
de proliferation we've actually had more
countries get nukes and keep getting

5108
01:40:10,430 --> 01:40:10,440
countries get nukes and keep getting
 

5109
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:13,070
countries get nukes and keep getting
faster nukes the race to hypersonics and

5110
01:40:13,070 --> 01:40:13,080
faster nukes the race to hypersonics and
 

5111
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:16,109
faster nukes the race to hypersonics and
things like that um and every new type

5112
01:40:16,109 --> 01:40:16,119
things like that um and every new type
 

5113
01:40:16,119 --> 01:40:17,669
things like that um and every new type
of technology that has emerged has

5114
01:40:17,669 --> 01:40:17,679
of technology that has emerged has
 

5115
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:21,950
of technology that has emerged has
created an arms race and so you can't do

5116
01:40:21,950 --> 01:40:21,960
created an arms race and so you can't do
 

5117
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:23,950
created an arms race and so you can't do
mutually assured destruction with

5118
01:40:23,950 --> 01:40:23,960
mutually assured destruction with
 

5119
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:25,629
mutually assured destruction with
multiple agents the way you can with two

5120
01:40:25,629 --> 01:40:25,639
multiple agents the way you can with two
 

5121
01:40:25,639 --> 01:40:28,669
multiple agents the way you can with two
agents two agents it's a much easier to

5122
01:40:28,669 --> 01:40:28,679
agents two agents it's a much easier to
 

5123
01:40:28,679 --> 01:40:30,629
agents two agents it's a much easier to
create a stable Nash equilibrium that's

5124
01:40:30,629 --> 01:40:30,639
create a stable Nash equilibrium that's
 

5125
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:32,550
create a stable Nash equilibrium that's
forced but the ability to Monitor and

5126
01:40:32,550 --> 01:40:32,560
forced but the ability to Monitor and
 

5127
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:33,870
forced but the ability to Monitor and
say if these guys shoot who do I shoot

5128
01:40:33,870 --> 01:40:33,880
say if these guys shoot who do I shoot
 

5129
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:35,350
say if these guys shoot who do I shoot
do I shoot them do I shoot everybody do

5130
01:40:35,350 --> 01:40:35,360
do I shoot them do I shoot everybody do
 

5131
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:37,550
do I shoot them do I shoot everybody do
I and so you get a three body problem

5132
01:40:37,550 --> 01:40:37,560
I and so you get a three body problem
 

5133
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:39,350
I and so you get a three body problem
you get a very complex type of thing

5134
01:40:39,350 --> 01:40:39,360
you get a very complex type of thing
 

5135
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:40,750
you get a very complex type of thing
when you have multiple agents and

5136
01:40:40,750 --> 01:40:40,760
when you have multiple agents and
 

5137
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:42,430
when you have multiple agents and
multiple different types of catastrophe

5138
01:40:42,430 --> 01:40:42,440
multiple different types of catastrophe
 

5139
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:44,310
multiple different types of catastrophe
weapons including ones that can be much

5140
01:40:44,310 --> 01:40:44,320
weapons including ones that can be much
 

5141
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:46,030
weapons including ones that can be much
more easily produce than nukes nukes are

5142
01:40:46,030 --> 01:40:46,040
more easily produce than nukes nukes are
 

5143
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:47,229
more easily produce than nukes nukes are
really hard to produce there's only

5144
01:40:47,229 --> 01:40:47,239
really hard to produce there's only
 

5145
01:40:47,239 --> 01:40:48,669
really hard to produce there's only
uranium in a few areas uranium

5146
01:40:48,669 --> 01:40:48,679
uranium in a few areas uranium
 

5147
01:40:48,679 --> 01:40:51,669
uranium in a few areas uranium
enrichment is hard icbms are hard

5149
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:54,189

01:40:54,189 --> 01:40:54,199
but weaponized drones hitting smart
 

5151
01:40:54,199 --> 01:40:55,750
but weaponized drones hitting smart
targets is not so hard there's a lot of

5152
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:55,760
targets is not so hard there's a lot of
 

5153
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:57,350
targets is not so hard there's a lot of
other things where basically the scale

5154
01:40:57,350 --> 01:40:57,360
other things where basically the scale
 

5155
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:59,030
other things where basically the scale
at being able to manufacture them is

5156
01:40:59,030 --> 01:40:59,040
at being able to manufacture them is
 

5157
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:00,270
at being able to manufacture them is
going way way down to where even

5158
01:41:00,270 --> 01:41:00,280
going way way down to where even
 

5159
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:03,629
going way way down to where even
non-state actors can have them and so

5160
01:41:03,629 --> 01:41:03,639
non-state actors can have them and so
 

5161
01:41:03,639 --> 01:41:06,589
non-state actors can have them and so
when we talk about exponential Tech and

5162
01:41:06,589 --> 01:41:06,599
when we talk about exponential Tech and
 

5163
01:41:06,599 --> 01:41:09,430
when we talk about exponential Tech and
the decentralization of exponential Tech

5164
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:09,440
the decentralization of exponential Tech
 

5165
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:11,070
the decentralization of exponential Tech
what that means is decentralized

5166
01:41:11,070 --> 01:41:11,080
what that means is decentralized

mutually assured destruction on where
you can't keep doing growth of the

01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:35,480
you can't keep doing growth of the
 

5191
01:41:35,480 --> 01:41:38,709
you can't keep doing growth of the
materials economy um in the same way

5192
01:41:38,709 --> 01:41:38,719
materials economy um in the same way
 

5193
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:40,950

01:41:43,390 --> 01:41:43,400
and where the fragility Dynamics are
 

5197
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:44,750

01:41:47,310 --> 01:41:47,320
catastrophic risk so now we're so like
 

5201
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:48,750

there was all the world until World War
II and World War II is just from a from

trying to create something for our
 

5373
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:24,430
trying to create something for our
people and it requires destroying some

5374
01:45:24,430 --> 01:45:24,440
people and it requires destroying some
 

5375
01:45:24,440 --> 01:45:27,629

um sociopathy is a funny topic because

5378
01:45:30,109 --> 01:45:30,119
um sociopathy is a funny topic because
 

5379
01:45:30,119 --> 01:45:32,070
um sociopathy is a funny topic because
it's possible to have very high falty to

01:45:32,070 --> 01:45:32,080
it's possible to have very high falty to
 

5381
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:34,629
it's possible to have very high falty to
your ingroup and work on perfecting the

01:45:34,629 --> 01:45:34,639
your ingroup and work on perfecting the
 

5383
01:45:34,639 --> 01:45:37,470
your ingroup and work on perfecting the
methods of torture to the outgroup um at

5384
01:45:37,470 --> 01:45:37,480
methods of torture to the outgroup um at
 

5385
01:45:37,480 --> 01:45:39,589
methods of torture to the outgroup um at
the same time because you can dehumanize

5386
01:45:39,589 --> 01:45:39,599
the same time because you can dehumanize
 

5387
01:45:39,599 --> 01:45:43,629
the same time because you can dehumanize
and then remove empathy um

5388
01:45:43,629 --> 01:45:43,639
and then remove empathy um
 

5389
01:45:43,639 --> 01:45:47,390
and then remove empathy um
and I would also say that there are

5390
01:45:47,390 --> 01:45:47,400
and I would also say that there are
 

5391
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:50,830
and I would also say that there are
types so the reason the thing that gives

01:46:04,310 --> 01:46:04,320
what it took to make a nuke a small
 

5405
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:07,030

required having studied for a while and
 

5411
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:14,830
required having studied for a while and
some then building capacity and there's

5412
01:46:14,830 --> 01:46:14,840
some then building capacity and there's
 

5413
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:16,950
some then building capacity and there's
a question of is that psychologically

5414
01:46:16,950 --> 01:46:16,960
a question of is that psychologically
 

5415
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:20,070
a question of is that psychologically

bit I think um no I think a lot I think
 

5423
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:31,990
bit I think um no I think a lot I think
it's actually I mean this is the

01:46:31,990 --> 01:46:32,000
it's actually I mean this is the
 

5425
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,589
it's actually I mean this is the
conversation I had like with I think

5426
01:46:33,589 --> 01:46:33,599
conversation I had like with I think
 

5427
01:46:33,599 --> 01:46:35,070
conversation I had like with I think
offline with Dan

5428

Carlin which is like it's pretty easy to

5430
01:46:38,390 --> 01:46:38,400
Carlin which is like it's pretty easy to
 

5431
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:41,550
Carlin which is like it's pretty easy to
come up with ways that any competent I I

5432
01:46:41,550 --> 01:46:41,560
come up with ways that any competent I I
 

5433
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:43,310
come up with ways that any competent I I
can come up with a lot of ways to hurt a

5434
01:46:43,310 --> 01:46:43,320
can come up with a lot of ways to hurt a
 

5435
01:46:43,320 --> 01:46:46,430
can come up with a lot of ways to hurt a
lot of people and it's pretty easy like

5436
01:46:46,430 --> 01:46:46,440
lot of people and it's pretty easy like
 

5437
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:49,390
lot of people and it's pretty easy like
I alone can do it

5438
01:46:49,390 --> 01:46:49,400
I alone can do it
 

5439
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:53,030
I alone can do it
and like there's a lot of people as

5440
01:46:53,030 --> 01:46:53,040
and like there's a lot of people as
 

5441
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:55,790
and like there's a lot of people as
smart or smarter than me at least in the

5442
01:46:55,790 --> 01:46:55,800
smart or smarter than me at least in the
 

5443
01:46:55,800 --> 01:46:56,990
smart or smarter than me at least in the
creation of

5444
01:46:56,990 --> 01:46:57,000
creation of
 

5445
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,830
creation of
explosives why are we're not seeing

5446
01:46:59,830 --> 01:46:59,840
explosives why are we're not seeing
 

5447
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:03,750
explosives why are we're not seeing
more insane mass murder I I think

5448
01:47:03,750 --> 01:47:03,760
more insane mass murder I I think
 

5449
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:04,589
more insane mass murder I I think
there's

5450
01:47:04,589 --> 01:47:04,599
there's
 

5451
01:47:04,599 --> 01:47:07,470
there's
something fascinating and beautiful

5452
01:47:07,470 --> 01:47:07,480
something fascinating and beautiful
 

5453
01:47:07,480 --> 01:47:10,589
something fascinating and beautiful
about this yes and it does have to do

5454
01:47:10,589 --> 01:47:10,599
about this yes and it does have to do
 

5455
01:47:10,599 --> 01:47:13,030
about this yes and it does have to do
with some deeply pro-social types of

5456
01:47:13,030 --> 01:47:13,040
with some deeply pro-social types of
 

5457
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:16,430
with some deeply pro-social types of
characteristics in humans and

5458
01:47:16,430 --> 01:47:16,440
characteristics in humans and
 

5459
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:19,510
characteristics in humans and
um but when you're dealing with very

5460
01:47:19,510 --> 01:47:19,520
um but when you're dealing with very
 

5461
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:21,870
um but when you're dealing with very
large numbers you don't need a whole lot

5462
01:47:21,870 --> 01:47:21,880
large numbers you don't need a whole lot
 

5463
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:23,990
large numbers you don't need a whole lot
of a phenomena and so then you start to

5464
01:47:23,990 --> 01:47:24,000
of a phenomena and so then you start to
 

5465
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,750
of a phenomena and so then you start to
say well what's the probability that X

5466
01:47:25,750 --> 01:47:25,760
say well what's the probability that X
 

5467
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:27,510
say well what's the probability that X
won't happen this year then won't happen

5468
01:47:27,510 --> 01:47:27,520
won't happen this year then won't happen
 

5469
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:29,109
won't happen this year then won't happen
in the next two years three years four

5470
01:47:29,109 --> 01:47:29,119
in the next two years three years four
 

5471
01:47:29,119 --> 01:47:31,950
in the next two years three years four
years and then how many people are doing

5472
01:47:31,950 --> 01:47:31,960
years and then how many people are doing
 

5473
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:33,950
years and then how many people are doing
destructive things with lower Tech and

5474
01:47:33,950 --> 01:47:33,960
destructive things with lower Tech and
 

5475
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:35,589
destructive things with lower Tech and
then how many of them can get access to

5476
01:47:35,589 --> 01:47:35,599
then how many of them can get access to
 

5477
01:47:35,599 --> 01:47:36,870
then how many of them can get access to
higher Tech that they didn't have to

5478
01:47:36,870 --> 01:47:36,880
higher Tech that they didn't have to
 

5479
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:38,070
higher Tech that they didn't have to
figure out how to

5480
01:47:38,070 --> 01:47:38,080
figure out how to
 

5481
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:42,709
figure out how to
build so uh when I can get commercial

5482
01:47:42,709 --> 01:47:42,719
build so uh when I can get commercial
 

5483
01:47:42,719 --> 01:47:45,830
build so uh when I can get commercial
Tech and maybe I don't understand Tech

5484
01:47:45,830 --> 01:47:45,840
Tech and maybe I don't understand Tech
 

5485
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:47,470
Tech and maybe I don't understand Tech
very well but I understand it well

5486
01:47:47,470 --> 01:47:47,480
very well but I understand it well
 

5487
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:49,470
very well but I understand it well
enough to utilize it not to create it

5488
01:47:49,470 --> 01:47:49,480
enough to utilize it not to create it
 

5489
01:47:49,480 --> 01:47:52,830
enough to utilize it not to create it
and I can repurpose said when we saw

5490
01:47:52,830 --> 01:47:52,840
and I can repurpose said when we saw
 

5491
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:55,270
and I can repurpose said when we saw
that commercial drone with a homemade

5492
01:47:55,270 --> 01:47:55,280
that commercial drone with a homemade
 

5493
01:47:55,280 --> 01:47:57,350
that commercial drone with a homemade
thermite bomb hit the Ukraine Ukrainian

5494
01:47:57,350 --> 01:47:57,360
thermite bomb hit the Ukraine Ukrainian
 

5495
01:47:57,360 --> 01:47:59,470
thermite bomb hit the Ukraine Ukrainian
Munitions Factory and do the equivalent

5496
01:47:59,470 --> 01:47:59,480
Munitions Factory and do the equivalent
 

5497
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:02,470
Munitions Factory and do the equivalent
of an incendiary bomb level of damage

5498
01:48:02,470 --> 01:48:02,480
of an incendiary bomb level of damage
 

5499
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:05,189
of an incendiary bomb level of damage
that's just home Tech that's just simple

5500
01:48:05,189 --> 01:48:05,199
that's just home Tech that's just simple
 

5501
01:48:05,199 --> 01:48:10,629
that's just home Tech that's just simple
kind of thing and so the question is not

5502
01:48:10,629 --> 01:48:10,639
kind of thing and so the question is not
 

5503
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:12,510
kind of thing and so the question is not
what is does it stay being a small

5504
01:48:12,510 --> 01:48:12,520
what is does it stay being a small
 

5505
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:14,070
what is does it stay being a small
percentage of the population the

5506
01:48:14,070 --> 01:48:14,080
percentage of the population the
 

5507
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:16,790
percentage of the population the
question is does can you bind that

5508
01:48:16,790 --> 01:48:16,800
question is does can you bind that
 

5509
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:19,229
question is does can you bind that

and especially now when you as you start
 

5515
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:26,229
and especially now when you as you start
to get into bigger things crisper genan

5516
01:48:26,229 --> 01:48:26,239
to get into bigger things crisper genan

visualize explosions and destruction and
 

5679
01:51:41,239 --> 01:51:43,350
visualize explosions and destruction and
then the sicker thought which is like we

5680
01:51:43,350 --> 01:51:43,360
then the sicker thought which is like we
 

5681
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:45,709
then the sicker thought which is like we
kind of enjoy for some weird reason

5682
01:51:45,709 --> 01:51:45,719
kind of enjoy for some weird reason
 

5683
01:51:45,719 --> 01:51:47,189
kind of enjoy for some weird reason
thinking about that kind of stuff even

5684
01:51:47,189 --> 01:51:47,199
thinking about that kind of stuff even
 

5685
01:51:47,199 --> 01:51:49,669
thinking about that kind of stuff even
though we wouldn't actually act on it

5686
01:51:49,669 --> 01:51:49,679
though we wouldn't actually act on it
 

5687
01:51:49,679 --> 01:51:51,709
though we wouldn't actually act on it
it's it's almost like some weird uh like

5688
01:51:51,709 --> 01:51:51,719
it's it's almost like some weird uh like
 

5689
01:51:51,719 --> 01:51:54,390
it's it's almost like some weird uh like
I love playing shooter games you know uh

5690
01:51:54,390 --> 01:51:54,400
I love playing shooter games you know uh
 

5691
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:56,589
I love playing shooter games you know uh
first person shooters and like

5692
01:51:56,589 --> 01:51:56,599
first person shooters and like
 

5693
01:51:56,599 --> 01:51:58,550
first person shooters and like
especially if it's like murdering zombie

5694
01:51:58,550 --> 01:51:58,560
especially if it's like murdering zombie
 

5695
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:01,709
especially if it's like murdering zombie
and doom you're shooting demons I played

5696
01:52:01,709 --> 01:52:01,719
and doom you're shooting demons I played
 

5697
01:52:01,719 --> 01:52:03,589

one of my favorite games Diablo is like

5698
01:52:03,589 --> 01:52:03,599
one of my favorite games Diablo is like
 

5699
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:05,950
one of my favorite games Diablo is like
slashing through different monsters and

5700
01:52:05,950 --> 01:52:05,960
slashing through different monsters and
 

5701
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:08,390
slashing through different monsters and
the screaming and pain and the Hellfire

5702
01:52:08,390 --> 01:52:08,400
the screaming and pain and the Hellfire
 

5703
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:10,910
the screaming and pain and the Hellfire
and then I go out into the real world uh

5704
01:52:10,910 --> 01:52:10,920
and then I go out into the real world uh
 

5705
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:12,510
and then I go out into the real world uh
to eat my coconut ice cream and I'm All

5706
01:52:12,510 --> 01:52:12,520
to eat my coconut ice cream and I'm All
 

5707
01:52:12,520 --> 01:52:14,390
to eat my coconut ice cream and I'm All
About Love so like

5708
01:52:14,390 --> 01:52:14,400
About Love so like

I can we trust our ability to visualize

01:52:17,560 --> 01:52:20,550
I can we trust our ability to visualize

01:52:23,589 --> 01:52:23,599
rational way of thinking I think it's a
 

5715
01:52:23,599 --> 01:52:25,990
rational way of thinking I think it's a
fair question to say to what degree is

5716
01:52:25,990 --> 01:52:26,000
fair question to say to what degree is
 

5717
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:30,189
fair question to say to what degree is
there just kind of perverse fantasy and

5718
01:52:30,189 --> 01:52:30,199
there just kind of perverse fantasy and
 

5719
01:52:30,199 --> 01:52:32,589
there just kind of perverse fantasy and
um morbid exploration and whatever else

5720
01:52:32,589 --> 01:52:32,599
um morbid exploration and whatever else
 

5721

that happens in our imagination
 

5723
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:37,629
that happens in our imagination
uh but I don't think that's the whole of

uh but I don't think that's the whole of

so when we look at a history of war and
then we look at exponentially more

then we look at exponentially more

01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:52,109
then we look at exponentially more

the cumulative effects there's a lot of

5802
01:54:04,229 --> 01:54:04,239
the cumulative effects there's a lot of
 

5803
01:54:04,239 --> 01:54:05,950
the cumulative effects there's a lot of
ways the whole thing can break like a

5804
01:54:05,950 --> 01:54:05,960
ways the whole thing can break like a
 

5805
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:08,350
ways the whole thing can break like a
lot of different ways and for it to get

5806
01:54:08,350 --> 01:54:08,360
lot of different ways and for it to get
 

5807
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:10,830
lot of different ways and for it to get
ahead it has to have none of those

5808
01:54:10,830 --> 01:54:10,840
ahead it has to have none of those
 

5809
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:13,790
ahead it has to have none of those
happen and so it there's just a

5810
01:54:13,790 --> 01:54:13,800
happen and so it there's just a
 

5811
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:15,750
happen and so it there's just a

01:54:15,750 --> 01:54:15,760
probability space where it's easier to

imagine that thing so what so to say how
 

5815
01:54:18,599 --> 01:54:20,270
imagine that thing so what so to say how
do we have a protopic future we have to

do we have a protopic future we have to
 

5817
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:23,510
do we have a protopic future we have to
say well one criteria must be that it

5818
01:54:23,510 --> 01:54:23,520
say well one criteria must be that it
 

5819
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:25,830
say well one criteria must be that it
avoids all of the catastrophic risks so

01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:27,629
avoids all of the catastrophic risks so
can we understand can we inventory all

01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:40,470
the essence of the social technology
that we're thinking about to be able to

5834
01:54:40,470 --> 01:54:40,480
that we're thinking about to be able to
 

5835
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:42,229
that we're thinking about to be able to
guide bind and direct the new physical

5836
01:54:42,229 --> 01:54:42,239
guide bind and direct the new physical
 

5837
01:54:42,239 --> 01:54:44,270
guide bind and direct the new physical
technology because so far our physical

5838
01:54:44,270 --> 01:54:44,280
technology because so far our physical
 

5839
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:46,270
technology because so far our physical
technology like we were talking about

5840
01:54:46,270 --> 01:54:46,280
technology like we were talking about
 

5841
01:54:46,280 --> 01:54:48,350
technology like we were talking about
the gangas cons and like that that

5842
01:54:48,350 --> 01:54:48,360
the gangas cons and like that that
 

5843
01:54:48,360 --> 01:54:50,589
the gangas cons and like that that
obviously use certain kinds of physical

5844
01:54:50,589 --> 01:54:50,599
obviously use certain kinds of physical
 

5845
01:54:50,599 --> 01:54:52,790
obviously use certain kinds of physical
technology and armaments um and also

5846
01:54:52,790 --> 01:54:52,800
technology and armaments um and also
 

5847
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:54,510
technology and armaments um and also
social technology and unconventional

5848
01:54:54,510 --> 01:54:54,520
social technology and unconventional
 

5849
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:57,830
social technology and unconventional
warfare for a particular set of purposes

5850
01:54:57,830 --> 01:54:57,840
warfare for a particular set of purposes
 

5851
01:54:57,840 --> 01:54:59,270
warfare for a particular set of purposes
but we have things that don't look like

5852
01:54:59,270 --> 01:54:59,280
but we have things that don't look like
 

5853
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:02,870
but we have things that don't look like
Warfare like Rockefeller and standard

5854
01:55:02,870 --> 01:55:02,880
Warfare like Rockefeller and standard
 

5855
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:05,990
Warfare like Rockefeller and standard
oil and it looked like a constructive

5856
01:55:05,990 --> 01:55:06,000
oil and it looked like a constructive
 

5857
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:09,870

5859
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:13,830
mindset to be able to uh bring this new
energy resource to the world and it did

5860
01:55:13,830 --> 01:55:13,840
energy resource to the world and it did
 

5861
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:16,229
energy resource to the world and it did
and the second order effects of that

5862
01:55:16,229 --> 01:55:16,239
and the second order effects of that
 

5863
01:55:16,239 --> 01:55:20,629
and the second order effects of that
are climate change and all of the oil

5864
01:55:20,629 --> 01:55:20,639
are climate change and all of the oil
 

5865
01:55:20,639 --> 01:55:22,310
are climate change and all of the oil
spills that have happened and will

5866
01:55:22,310 --> 01:55:22,320
spills that have happened and will
 

5867
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:25,430
spills that have happened and will
happen and all of the wars in the Middle

5868
01:55:25,430 --> 01:55:25,440
happen and all of the wars in the Middle
 

5869
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:27,830
happen and all of the wars in the Middle
East over the oil that have been there

5870
01:55:27,830 --> 01:55:27,840
East over the oil that have been there
 

5871
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:30,790
East over the oil that have been there
and the massive political cluster [\h__\h]

5872
01:55:30,790 --> 01:55:30,800
and the massive political cluster [\h__\h]
 

5873
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:32,069
and the massive political cluster [\h__\h]
um and human life issues that are

5874
01:55:32,069 --> 01:55:32,079
um and human life issues that are
 

5875
01:55:32,079 --> 01:55:35,390
um and human life issues that are
associated with it and on and on right

5876
01:55:35,390 --> 01:55:35,400
associated with it and on and on right
 

5877
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:38,510
associated with it and on and on right
um and so it's

5878
01:55:38,510 --> 01:55:38,520
um and so it's
 

5879
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:42,069
um and so it's
also not just the orientation to

5880
01:55:42,069 --> 01:55:42,079
also not just the orientation to
 

5881
01:55:42,079 --> 01:55:43,870
also not just the orientation to
construct a thing can have a narrow

01:55:47,069 --> 01:55:47,079
but be affecting a lot of other things
 

5887
01:55:47,079 --> 01:55:48,390
but be affecting a lot of other things
through second and third order effects

01:55:48,390 --> 01:55:48,400
through second and third order effects
 

5889
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:50,470
through second and third order effects
I'm not taking responsibility before and

5890
01:55:50,470 --> 01:55:50,480
I'm not taking responsibility before and
 

5891
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:53,550
I'm not taking responsibility before and
you you you often on another tangent

5892
01:55:53,550 --> 01:55:53,560
you you you often on another tangent
 

5893
01:55:53,560 --> 01:55:56,149
you you you often on another tangent
mention second third and fourth order

5894
01:55:56,149 --> 01:55:56,159
mention second third and fourth order
 

5895
01:55:56,159 --> 01:55:58,629
mention second third and fourth order
effects and

5896
01:55:58,629 --> 01:55:58,639
effects and
 

5897
01:55:58,639 --> 01:56:01,910
effects and
ordering which is really fascinating

5898
01:56:01,910 --> 01:56:01,920
ordering which is really fascinating
 

5899
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:05,589
ordering which is really fascinating
like starting with the third order

5900
01:56:05,589 --> 01:56:05,599
like starting with the third order
 

5901
01:56:05,599 --> 01:56:08,470
like starting with the third order
plus it gets really interesting because

5902
01:56:08,470 --> 01:56:08,480
plus it gets really interesting because
 

5903
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:10,270
plus it gets really interesting because
we we don't we don't even acknowledge

we we don't we don't even acknowledge
 

5905
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:13,109
we we don't we don't even acknowledge
like the second order effects right but

5906
01:56:13,109 --> 01:56:13,119
like the second order effects right but
 

5907
01:56:13,119 --> 01:56:15,390
like the second order effects right but
like thinking cuz those it could M it

5908
01:56:15,390 --> 01:56:15,400
like thinking cuz those it could M it
 

5909
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:16,950
like thinking cuz those it could M it
could get bigger and bigger and bigger

5910
01:56:16,950 --> 01:56:16,960
could get bigger and bigger and bigger
 

5911
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:19,229
could get bigger and bigger and bigger

5965
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:22,950
but the outg group is also working on
growing the tech and if they don't lose

01:57:22,950 --> 01:57:22,960
growing the tech and if they don't lose
 

5967
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:24,830

01:58:43,270 --> 01:58:43,280
that but it was a second order effect
 

6031
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:45,669
that but it was a second order effect
and it's a pretty [\h__\h] powerful

6032
01:58:45,669 --> 01:58:45,679
and it's a pretty [\h__\h] powerful
 

6033
01:58:45,679 --> 01:58:49,350
and it's a pretty [\h__\h] powerful
second order effect um and a pretty f

6034
01:58:49,350 --> 01:58:49,360

fast one because the rate of tech is

6036
01:58:50,870 --> 01:58:50,880
fast one because the rate of tech is
 

6037
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:52,830
fast one because the rate of tech is
obviously able to get distributed to

6038
01:58:52,830 --> 01:58:52,840
obviously able to get distributed to
 

6039
01:58:52,840 --> 01:58:55,470
obviously able to get distributed to
much larger scale much faster and with a

6040
01:58:55,470 --> 01:58:55,480
much larger scale much faster and with a
 

6041
01:58:55,480 --> 01:58:57,990
much larger scale much faster and with a
bigger jump in terms of total vertical

6042
01:58:57,990 --> 01:58:58,000
bigger jump in terms of total vertical
 

6043
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,510
bigger jump in terms of total vertical
capacity then that's what it means to

6044
01:58:59,510 --> 01:58:59,520
capacity then that's what it means to
 

6045
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:00,750
capacity then that's what it means to
get to the verticalized part of an

6046
01:59:00,750 --> 01:59:00,760
get to the verticalized part of an
 

6047
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:01,910
get to the verticalized part of an

exponential
 

6049
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:06,990
exponential
curve so um just like we can see that

6050
01:59:06,990 --> 01:59:07,000
curve so um just like we can see that
 

6051
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:08,669
curve so um just like we can see that
oil had these second order environmental

6052
01:59:08,669 --> 01:59:08,679
oil had these second order environmental
 

6053
01:59:08,679 --> 01:59:10,229
oil had these second order environmental
effects and also social and political

6054
01:59:10,229 --> 01:59:10,239
effects and also social and political
 

6055
01:59:10,239 --> 01:59:14,709
effects and also social and political
effects war and so much of the whole

6056
01:59:14,709 --> 01:59:14,719
effects war and so much of the whole
 

6057
01:59:14,719 --> 01:59:17,910
effects war and so much of the whole
like the total amount of oil used is has

6058
01:59:17,910 --> 01:59:17,920
like the total amount of oil used is has
 

6059
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:21,109
like the total amount of oil used is has
a proportionality to Global GDP and this

6060
01:59:21,109 --> 01:59:21,119
a proportionality to Global GDP and this
 

6061
01:59:21,119 --> 01:59:22,589
a proportionality to Global GDP and this
is why we have this you know the Petro

6062
01:59:22,589 --> 01:59:22,599
is why we have this you know the Petro
 

6063
01:59:22,599 --> 01:59:27,709
is why we have this you know the Petro
dollar and um and so the the oil thing

6064
01:59:27,709 --> 01:59:27,719
dollar and um and so the the oil thing
 

6065
01:59:27,719 --> 01:59:29,870
dollar and um and so the the oil thing
also had the externalities of a major

6066
01:59:29,870 --> 01:59:29,880
also had the externalities of a major
 

6067
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:30,950
also had the externalities of a major
aspect of what happened with

6068
01:59:30,950 --> 01:59:30,960
aspect of what happened with
 

6069
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:32,750
aspect of what happened with
military-industrial complex and things

6070
01:59:32,750 --> 01:59:32,760
military-industrial complex and things
 

6071
01:59:32,760 --> 01:59:35,470
military-industrial complex and things
like that so but we can see the same

6072
01:59:35,470 --> 01:59:35,480
like that so but we can see the same
 

6073
01:59:35,480 --> 01:59:37,270
like that so but we can see the same
thing with with more current

6074
01:59:37,270 --> 01:59:37,280
thing with with more current
 

6075
01:59:37,280 --> 01:59:39,589
thing with with more current
Technologies with Facebook and Google um

6076
01:59:39,589 --> 01:59:39,599
Technologies with Facebook and Google um
 

6077
01:59:39,599 --> 01:59:41,669
Technologies with Facebook and Google um
and and other things

6078
01:59:41,669 --> 01:59:41,679
and and other things
 

6079
01:59:41,679 --> 01:59:45,310
and and other things
so I don't think we can run and the more

6080
01:59:45,310 --> 01:59:45,320
so I don't think we can run and the more
 

6081
01:59:45,320 --> 01:59:48,270
so I don't think we can run and the more
powerful the tech is we build it for

6082
01:59:48,270 --> 01:59:48,280
powerful the tech is we build it for
 

6083
01:59:48,280 --> 01:59:51,629
powerful the tech is we build it for

three things maybe it's one thing right

6086
01:59:53,910 --> 01:59:53,920
three things maybe it's one thing right
 

6087
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:56,390
three things maybe it's one thing right
we we're doing the oil thing because we

6088
01:59:56,390 --> 01:59:56,400
we we're doing the oil thing because we
 

6089
01:59:56,400 --> 01:59:58,470
we we're doing the oil thing because we
want to make cars because it's a better

6090
01:59:58,470 --> 01:59:58,480
want to make cars because it's a better
 

6091

we're building the Facebook thing

6094
02:00:01,030 --> 02:00:01,040
we're building the Facebook thing
 

6095
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:02,229
we're building the Facebook thing
because we're going to connect people

6096
02:00:02,229 --> 02:00:02,239
because we're going to connect people
 

6097
02:00:02,239 --> 02:00:05,629
because we're going to connect people
socially in the personal sphere but it

6098
02:00:05,629 --> 02:00:05,639
socially in the personal sphere but it
 

6099
02:00:05,639 --> 02:00:07,550
socially in the personal sphere but it
it interf effects with it interacts with

6100
02:00:07,550 --> 02:00:07,560
it interf effects with it interacts with
 

6101
02:00:07,560 --> 02:00:10,830
it interf effects with it interacts with
complex systems with ecologies economies

6102
02:00:10,830 --> 02:00:10,840
complex systems with ecologies economies
 

6103
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:13,629
complex systems with ecologies economies
psychologies cultures and so it has

6104
02:00:13,629 --> 02:00:13,639
psychologies cultures and so it has
 

6105
02:00:13,639 --> 02:00:15,430
psychologies cultures and so it has
effects on other than the thing we're

6106
02:00:15,430 --> 02:00:15,440
effects on other than the thing we're
 

6107
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:18,589
effects on other than the thing we're
intending some of those effects can end

6108
02:00:18,589 --> 02:00:18,599
intending some of those effects can end
 

6109
02:00:18,599 --> 02:00:20,229
intending some of those effects can end
up being negative effects but because

6110
02:00:20,229 --> 02:00:20,239
up being negative effects but because
 

6111
02:00:20,239 --> 02:00:22,750
up being negative effects but because
this technology if if we make it to

6112
02:00:22,750 --> 02:00:22,760
this technology if if we make it to
 

6113
02:00:22,760 --> 02:00:25,550
this technology if if we make it to
solve a problem it has to overcome the

6114
02:00:25,550 --> 02:00:25,560
solve a problem it has to overcome the
 

6115
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:26,709
solve a problem it has to overcome the
problem the problem's been around for a

02:00:26,709 --> 02:00:26,719
problem the problem's been around for a
 

6117
02:00:26,719 --> 02:00:27,790
problem the problem's been around for a
while it's going to overcome in a short

6118
02:00:27,790 --> 02:00:27,800
while it's going to overcome in a short
 

6119
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:29,550
while it's going to overcome in a short
period of time so it usually has greater

6120
02:00:29,550 --> 02:00:29,560
period of time so it usually has greater
 

6121
02:00:29,560 --> 02:00:31,629
period of time so it usually has greater
scale greater rate of magnitude in some

6122
02:00:31,629 --> 02:00:31,639
scale greater rate of magnitude in some
 

6123
02:00:31,639 --> 02:00:34,030
scale greater rate of magnitude in some
way that also means that the

6124
02:00:34,030 --> 02:00:34,040
way that also means that the
 

6125
02:00:34,040 --> 02:00:35,709
way that also means that the
externalities that it creates might be

6126
02:00:35,709 --> 02:00:35,719
externalities that it creates might be
 

6127
02:00:35,719 --> 02:00:36,629
externalities that it creates might be
bigger

6128
02:00:36,629 --> 02:00:36,639
bigger
 

6129
02:00:36,639 --> 02:00:39,109
bigger
problems and you can say well but then

6130
02:00:39,109 --> 02:00:39,119
problems and you can say well but then
 

6131
02:00:39,119 --> 02:00:40,310
problems and you can say well but then
that's the new problem and Humanity will

6132
02:00:40,310 --> 02:00:40,320
that's the new problem and Humanity will
 

6133
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:42,270
that's the new problem and Humanity will
innovate its way out of that well I

6134
02:00:42,270 --> 02:00:42,280
innovate its way out of that well I
 

6135
02:00:42,280 --> 02:00:43,510
innovate its way out of that well I
don't think that's paying attention to

6136
02:00:43,510 --> 02:00:43,520
don't think that's paying attention to
 

6137
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:45,069
don't think that's paying attention to
the fact that we can't keep up with

6138
02:00:45,069 --> 02:00:45,079
the fact that we can't keep up with
 

6139
02:00:45,079 --> 02:00:47,870
the fact that we can't keep up with
exponential curves like that nor do

6140
02:00:47,870 --> 02:00:47,880
exponential curves like that nor do
 

6141
02:00:47,880 --> 02:00:49,870
exponential curves like that nor do
finite spaces allow exponential

6142
02:00:49,870 --> 02:00:49,880

forever and this is why a lot of the

02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:24,189
and that's going to take
fruition that that little seed is going

6458
02:07:24,189 --> 02:07:24,199
fruition that that little seed is going
 

6459
02:07:24,199 --> 02:07:26,069
fruition that that little seed is going
to become a tree that then leads to the

6460
02:07:26,069 --> 02:07:26,079
to become a tree that then leads to the
 

6461
02:07:26,079 --> 02:07:29,549
to become a tree that then leads to the
kind of Destruction that that we talk

6462
02:07:29,549 --> 02:07:29,559
kind of Destruction that that we talk
 

6463
02:07:29,559 --> 02:07:32,310
kind of Destruction that that we talk
about uh so but in my sense it's

6464
02:07:32,310 --> 02:07:32,320
about uh so but in my sense it's
 

6465
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:33,950
about uh so but in my sense it's
possible to reduce everything to a

6466
02:07:33,950 --> 02:07:33,960
possible to reduce everything to a
 

6467
02:07:33,960 --> 02:07:35,709
possible to reduce everything to a
measure of how much love does this add

6468
02:07:35,709 --> 02:07:35,719
measure of how much love does this add
 

6469
02:07:35,719 --> 02:07:37,510
measure of how much love does this add
to the

6470
02:07:37,510 --> 02:07:37,520
to the
 

6471
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:40,709
to the
world all that to say uh do you have

6472
02:07:40,709 --> 02:07:40,719
world all that to say uh do you have
 

6473
02:07:40,719 --> 02:07:45,310
world all that to say uh do you have
ideas of how we practically uh build

6474
02:07:45,310 --> 02:07:45,320
ideas of how we practically uh build
 

6475
02:07:45,320 --> 02:07:48,030
ideas of how we practically uh build
systems that that that create uh

6476
02:07:48,030 --> 02:07:48,040
systems that that that create uh
 

6477
02:07:48,040 --> 02:07:49,069
systems that that that create uh
resilience

6478
02:07:49,069 --> 02:07:49,079
resilience
 

6479
02:07:49,079 --> 02:07:51,149
resilience
Society there were a lot of good things

6480
02:07:51,149 --> 02:07:51,159
Society there were a lot of good things
 

6481
02:07:51,159 --> 02:07:54,229
Society there were a lot of good things
that you shared where there's like 15

6482
02:07:54,229 --> 02:07:54,239
that you shared where there's like 15
 

6483
02:07:54,239 --> 02:07:56,030
that you shared where there's like 15
different ways that we could enter this

6484
02:07:56,030 --> 02:07:56,040
different ways that we could enter this
 

6485
02:07:56,040 --> 02:07:57,870
different ways that we could enter this
that are all interesting so I'm trying

6486
02:07:57,870 --> 02:07:57,880
that are all interesting so I'm trying
 

6487
02:07:57,880 --> 02:07:59,430
that are all interesting so I'm trying
to see which one will probably be most

6488
02:07:59,430 --> 02:07:59,440
to see which one will probably be most
 

6489
02:07:59,440 --> 02:08:01,950
to see which one will probably be most
useful pick the uh the one or two things

6490
02:08:01,950 --> 02:08:01,960
useful pick the uh the one or two things
 

6491
02:08:01,960 --> 02:08:04,870
useful pick the uh the one or two things
that are least ridiculous when you were

6492
02:08:04,870 --> 02:08:04,880
that are least ridiculous when you were
 

6493
02:08:04,880 --> 02:08:09,629
that are least ridiculous when you were
mentioning if we could see some of the

6494
02:08:09,629 --> 02:08:09,639
mentioning if we could see some of the
 

6495
02:08:09,639 --> 02:08:11,310
mentioning if we could see some of the
second order effects or externalities

6496
02:08:11,310 --> 02:08:11,320
second order effects or externalities
 

6497
02:08:11,320 --> 02:08:12,310
second order effects or externalities
that we aren't used to seeing

6498
02:08:12,310 --> 02:08:12,320
that we aren't used to seeing
 

6499
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:14,549
that we aren't used to seeing
specifically the one of a kid being

6500
02:08:14,549 --> 02:08:14,559
specifically the one of a kid being
 

6501
02:08:14,559 --> 02:08:16,189
specifically the one of a kid being
radicalized somewhere else which

6502
02:08:16,189 --> 02:08:16,199
radicalized somewhere else which
 

6503
02:08:16,199 --> 02:08:17,950
radicalized somewhere else which
engenders enmity in them towards us

6504
02:08:17,950 --> 02:08:17,960
engenders enmity in them towards us
 

6505
02:08:17,960 --> 02:08:20,149
engenders enmity in them towards us
which decreas is our own future Security

6506
02:08:20,149 --> 02:08:20,159
which decreas is our own future Security
 

6507
02:08:20,159 --> 02:08:21,390
which decreas is our own future Security
even if you don't care about the kid if

6508
02:08:21,390 --> 02:08:21,400
even if you don't care about the kid if
 

6509
02:08:21,400 --> 02:08:22,390
even if you don't care about the kid if
you care about the kid it's a whole

6510
02:08:22,390 --> 02:08:22,400
you care about the kid it's a whole
 

6511
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:27,109
you care about the kid it's a whole
other thing um yeah I mean I think when

6512
02:08:27,109 --> 02:08:27,119
other thing um yeah I mean I think when
 

6513
02:08:27,119 --> 02:08:28,910
other thing um yeah I mean I think when
we saw this when Jane Fonda and others

6514
02:08:28,910 --> 02:08:28,920
we saw this when Jane Fonda and others
 

6515
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:31,589
we saw this when Jane Fonda and others
went to Vietnam and took photos and

6516
02:08:31,589 --> 02:08:31,599
went to Vietnam and took photos and
 

6517
02:08:31,599 --> 02:08:32,870
went to Vietnam and took photos and
videos of what was happening and you got

6518
02:08:32,870 --> 02:08:32,880
videos of what was happening and you got
 

6519
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:34,750
videos of what was happening and you got
to see the pictures of the kids with

6520
02:08:34,750 --> 02:08:34,760
to see the pictures of the kids with
 

6521
02:08:34,760 --> 02:08:39,069
to see the pictures of the kids with
Napal on them uh that like the anti-war

6522
02:08:39,069 --> 02:08:39,079
Napal on them uh that like the anti-war
 

6523
02:08:39,079 --> 02:08:41,950
Napal on them uh that like the anti-war
effort was bolstered by that in a way it

6524
02:08:41,950 --> 02:08:41,960
effort was bolstered by that in a way it
 

6525
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:43,589
effort was bolstered by that in a way it
couldn't have been without that there's

6526
02:08:43,589 --> 02:08:43,599
couldn't have been without that there's
 

6527
02:08:43,599 --> 02:08:44,430
couldn't have been without that there's
there's

6528
02:08:44,430 --> 02:08:44,440
there's
 

6529
02:08:44,440 --> 02:08:46,990
there's
a until we can see the images you can't

6530
02:08:46,990 --> 02:08:47,000
a until we can see the images you can't
 

6531
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,510
a until we can see the images you can't
have a Mir Neuron a effect in the same

6532
02:08:49,510 --> 02:08:49,520
have a Mir Neuron a effect in the same
 

6533
02:08:49,520 --> 02:08:51,669
have a Mir Neuron a effect in the same
way and when you can that starts to have

6534
02:08:51,669 --> 02:08:51,679
way and when you can that starts to have
 

6535
02:08:51,679 --> 02:08:53,709
way and when you can that starts to have
a a powerful effect I think there's a

6536
02:08:53,709 --> 02:08:53,719
a a powerful effect I think there's a
 

6537
02:08:53,719 --> 02:08:56,189
a a powerful effect I think there's a
deep principle that you're sharing there

6538
02:08:56,189 --> 02:08:56,199
deep principle that you're sharing there
 

6539
02:08:56,199 --> 02:08:57,790
deep principle that you're sharing there
which

6540
02:08:57,790 --> 02:08:57,800
which
 

6541
02:08:57,800 --> 02:09:02,790
which
is that if we we can have a rivalrous

6542
02:09:02,790 --> 02:09:02,800
is that if we we can have a rivalrous
 

6543
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:06,229
is that if we we can have a rivalrous
intent where our in group whatever it is

6544
02:09:06,229 --> 02:09:06,239
intent where our in group whatever it is
 

6545
02:09:06,239 --> 02:09:07,629
intent where our in group whatever it is
maybe it's our political party wanting

6546
02:09:07,629 --> 02:09:07,639
maybe it's our political party wanting
 

6547
02:09:07,639 --> 02:09:10,030
maybe it's our political party wanting
to win within the us maybe it's our

6548
02:09:10,030 --> 02:09:10,040
to win within the us maybe it's our
 

6549
02:09:10,040 --> 02:09:12,790
to win within the us maybe it's our
nation state wanting to win in a a war

6550
02:09:12,790 --> 02:09:12,800
nation state wanting to win in a a war
 

6551
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:14,830
nation state wanting to win in a a war
or an economic War over resource or

6552
02:09:14,830 --> 02:09:14,840
or an economic War over resource or
 

6553
02:09:14,840 --> 02:09:17,270
or an economic War over resource or
whatever it is that if we don't

6554
02:09:17,270 --> 02:09:17,280
whatever it is that if we don't
 

6555
02:09:17,280 --> 02:09:19,709
whatever it is that if we don't
obliterate the other people completely

6556
02:09:19,709 --> 02:09:19,719
obliterate the other people completely
 

6557
02:09:19,719 --> 02:09:22,629
obliterate the other people completely
they don't go away they're they're not

6558
02:09:22,629 --> 02:09:22,639
they don't go away they're they're not
 

6559
02:09:22,639 --> 02:09:24,350
they don't go away they're they're not
engendered to like us

6560
02:09:24,350 --> 02:09:24,360
engendered to like us
 

6561
02:09:24,360 --> 02:09:27,030
engendered to like us
more they they didn't become less smart

6562
02:09:27,030 --> 02:09:27,040
more they they didn't become less smart
 

6563
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:28,830
more they they didn't become less smart
so they have more enmity towards us and

6564
02:09:28,830 --> 02:09:28,840
so they have more enmity towards us and
 

6565
02:09:28,840 --> 02:09:30,669
so they have more enmity towards us and
whatever Technologies we employed to be

6566
02:09:30,669 --> 02:09:30,679
whatever Technologies we employed to be
 

6567
02:09:30,679 --> 02:09:32,030
whatever Technologies we employed to be
successful they will now reverse

6568
02:09:32,030 --> 02:09:32,040
successful they will now reverse
 

6569
02:09:32,040 --> 02:09:34,589
successful they will now reverse
engineer make iterations on and come

6570
02:09:34,589 --> 02:09:34,599
engineer make iterations on and come
 

6571
02:09:34,599 --> 02:09:37,350
engineer make iterations on and come
back and so you drive an arms race which

6572
02:09:37,350 --> 02:09:37,360
back and so you drive an arms race which
 

6573
02:09:37,360 --> 02:09:41,109
back and so you drive an arms race which
is why you can see that the wars were

6574
02:09:41,109 --> 02:09:41,119
is why you can see that the wars were
 

6575
02:09:41,119 --> 02:09:43,549
is why you can see that the wars were
over history employing more

6576
02:09:43,549 --> 02:09:43,559
over history employing more
 

6577
02:09:43,559 --> 02:09:47,189
over history employing more
lethal weaponry and not just the kinetic

6578
02:09:47,189 --> 02:09:47,199
lethal weaponry and not just the kinetic
 

6579
02:09:47,199 --> 02:09:50,790
lethal weaponry and not just the kinetic
War um um the information War and the

6580
02:09:50,790 --> 02:09:50,800
War um um the information War and the
 

6581
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:53,510
War um um the information War and the
narrative War and the economic War right

6582
02:09:53,510 --> 02:09:53,520
narrative War and the economic War right
 

6583
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:55,870
narrative War and the economic War right
like it just increased capacity in all

6584
02:09:55,870 --> 02:09:55,880
like it just increased capacity in all
 

6585
02:09:55,880 --> 02:09:56,790
like it just increased capacity in all
of those

6586
02:09:56,790 --> 02:09:56,800
of those
 

6587
02:09:56,800 --> 02:10:00,229
of those
fronts um and so what seems like a win

6588
02:10:00,229 --> 02:10:00,239
fronts um and so what seems like a win
 

6589
02:10:00,239 --> 02:10:03,229
fronts um and so what seems like a win
to us on the short term might actually

6590
02:10:03,229 --> 02:10:03,239
to us on the short term might actually
 

6591
02:10:03,239 --> 02:10:05,270
to us on the short term might actually
really produce losses in the long term

6592
02:10:05,270 --> 02:10:05,280
really produce losses in the long term
 

6593
02:10:05,280 --> 02:10:06,950
really produce losses in the long term
and what's even in our own best interest

6594
02:10:06,950 --> 02:10:06,960
and what's even in our own best interest
 

6595
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:08,270
and what's even in our own best interest
in the long term is probably more

6596
02:10:08,270 --> 02:10:08,280
in the long term is probably more
 

6597
02:10:08,280 --> 02:10:09,390
in the long term is probably more
aligned with everyone else because we

6598
02:10:09,390 --> 02:10:09,400
aligned with everyone else because we
 

6599
02:10:09,400 --> 02:10:11,870
aligned with everyone else because we
intera affect each other and I think the

6600
02:10:11,870 --> 02:10:11,880
intera affect each other and I think the
 

6601
02:10:11,880 --> 02:10:15,189
intera affect each other and I think the
thing about globalism globalization and

6602
02:10:15,189 --> 02:10:15,199
thing about globalism globalization and
 

6603
02:10:15,199 --> 02:10:16,830
thing about globalism globalization and
exponential Tech and the rate at which

6604
02:10:16,830 --> 02:10:16,840
exponential Tech and the rate at which
 

6605
02:10:16,840 --> 02:10:17,950
exponential Tech and the rate at which
we affect each other and the rate at

6606
02:10:17,950 --> 02:10:17,960
we affect each other and the rate at
 

6607
02:10:17,960 --> 02:10:19,229
we affect each other and the rate at
which we affect the biosphere that we're

6608
02:10:19,229 --> 02:10:19,239
which we affect the biosphere that we're
 

6609
02:10:19,239 --> 02:10:23,189
which we affect the biosphere that we're
all affected by is that this this kind

6610
02:10:23,189 --> 02:10:23,199
all affected by is that this this kind
 

6611
02:10:23,199 --> 02:10:27,149
all affected by is that this this kind
of proverbial spiritual idea that we're

culture of that many people um and head

6772
02:13:38,310 --> 02:13:38,320

02:13:40,350 --> 02:13:40,360
traumas and what whatever and nobody
 

6775
02:13:40,360 --> 02:13:43,430
traumas and what whatever and nobody
hurts bugs and then you look at a group

6776
02:13:43,430 --> 02:13:43,440
hurts bugs and then you look at a group
 

6777
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:45,350
hurts bugs and then you look at a group
where the kids grow up as child soldiers

6778
02:13:45,350 --> 02:13:45,360
where the kids grow up as child soldiers
 

6779
02:13:45,360 --> 02:13:48,109
where the kids grow up as child soldiers
in Liberia or darur where to make it to

6780
02:13:48,109 --> 02:13:48,119
in Liberia or darur where to make it to
 

6781
02:13:48,119 --> 02:13:49,669
in Liberia or darur where to make it to
adulthood pretty much everybody's killed

6782
02:13:49,669 --> 02:13:49,679
adulthood pretty much everybody's killed
 

6783
02:13:49,679 --> 02:13:52,149
adulthood pretty much everybody's killed
people hand to hand and killed people

6784
02:13:52,149 --> 02:13:52,159
people hand to hand and killed people
 

6785
02:13:52,159 --> 02:13:54,310
people hand to hand and killed people
who were civilian or innocent type of

6786
02:13:54,310 --> 02:13:54,320
who were civilian or innocent type of
 

6787
02:13:54,320 --> 02:13:57,950
who were civilian or innocent type of
people and you say okay so we were very

6788
02:13:57,950 --> 02:13:57,960
people and you say okay so we were very
 

6789
02:13:57,960 --> 02:13:59,669
people and you say okay so we were very
neous we can be conditioned by our

6790
02:13:59,669 --> 02:13:59,679
neous we can be conditioned by our
 

6791
02:13:59,679 --> 02:14:01,830
neous we can be conditioned by our
environment and humans can be

6792
02:14:01,830 --> 02:14:01,840
environment and humans can be
 

6793
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:04,430
environment and humans can be
conditioned where almost all the humans

6794
02:14:04,430 --> 02:14:04,440
conditioned where almost all the humans
 

6795
02:14:04,440 --> 02:14:05,870
conditioned where almost all the humans
show up in these two different bell

6796
02:14:05,870 --> 02:14:05,880
show up in these two different bell
 

6797
02:14:05,880 --> 02:14:07,350
show up in these two different bell
curves it doesn't mean that the Buddhist

6798
02:14:07,350 --> 02:14:07,360
curves it doesn't mean that the Buddhist
 

6799
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:08,629
curves it doesn't mean that the Buddhist
had no violence it doesn't mean that

6800
02:14:08,629 --> 02:14:08,639
had no violence it doesn't mean that
 

6801
02:14:08,639 --> 02:14:10,549
had no violence it doesn't mean that
these people had no compassion but the

6802
02:14:10,549 --> 02:14:10,559
these people had no compassion but the
 

6803
02:14:10,559 --> 02:14:13,069
these people had no compassion but the
they're very different gaussian

6804
02:14:13,069 --> 02:14:13,079
they're very different gaussian
 

6805
02:14:13,079 --> 02:14:14,709
they're very different gaussian
distributions

6806
02:14:14,709 --> 02:14:14,719
distributions
 

6807
02:14:14,719 --> 02:14:17,149
distributions
and so I think one of the important

6808
02:14:17,149 --> 02:14:17,159
and so I think one of the important
 

6809
02:14:17,159 --> 02:14:19,950
and so I think one of the important
things I like to do is look at the

6810
02:14:19,950 --> 02:14:19,960
things I like to do is look at the
 

6811
02:14:19,960 --> 02:14:22,709
things I like to do is look at the
examples of the populations what

6812
02:14:22,709 --> 02:14:22,719
examples of the populations what
 

6813
02:14:22,719 --> 02:14:25,950
examples of the populations what
Buddhism shows regarding Compassion or

6814
02:14:25,950 --> 02:14:25,960
Buddhism shows regarding Compassion or
 

6815
02:14:25,960 --> 02:14:28,950
Buddhism shows regarding Compassion or
what Judaism shows around education the

6816
02:14:28,950 --> 02:14:28,960
what Judaism shows around education the
 

6817
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:30,549
what Judaism shows around education the
average level of Education that

6818
02:14:30,549 --> 02:14:30,559
average level of Education that
 

6819
02:14:30,559 --> 02:14:31,870
average level of Education that
everybody gets because of a culture that

6820
02:14:31,870 --> 02:14:31,880
everybody gets because of a culture that
 

6821
02:14:31,880 --> 02:14:33,510
everybody gets because of a culture that
is really working on conditioning it or

6822
02:14:33,510 --> 02:14:33,520
is really working on conditioning it or
 

6823
02:14:33,520 --> 02:14:35,910
is really working on conditioning it or
or various cultures what are the

6824
02:14:35,910 --> 02:14:35,920
or various cultures what are the
 

6825
02:14:35,920 --> 02:14:38,870
or various cultures what are the
positive deviants outs of the

6826
02:14:38,870 --> 02:14:38,880
positive deviants outs of the
 

6827
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:41,390
positive deviants outs of the
statistical deviants to see what is

6828
02:14:41,390 --> 02:14:41,400
statistical deviants to see what is
 

6829
02:14:41,400 --> 02:14:44,069
statistical deviants to see what is
actually possible and then say what are

6830
02:14:44,069 --> 02:14:44,079
actually possible and then say what are
 

6831
02:14:44,079 --> 02:14:46,310
actually possible and then say what are
the conditioning factors and can we

6832
02:14:46,310 --> 02:14:46,320
the conditioning factors and can we
 

6833
02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:47,870
the conditioning factors and can we
condition those across a few of them

6834
02:14:47,870 --> 02:14:47,880
condition those across a few of them
 

6835
02:14:47,880 --> 02:14:49,510
condition those across a few of them
simultaneously and could we build a

6836
02:14:49,510 --> 02:14:49,520
simultaneously and could we build a
 

6837
02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:51,990
simultaneously and could we build a
civilization like that becomes a very

6838
02:14:51,990 --> 02:14:52,000
civilization like that becomes a very
 

6839
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,910
civilization like that becomes a very
interesting question so there's this

6840
02:14:53,910 --> 02:14:53,920
interesting question so there's this
 

6841
02:14:53,920 --> 02:14:57,189
interesting question so there's this
kind of real politic idea that humans

6842
02:14:57,189 --> 02:14:57,199
kind of real politic idea that humans
 

6843
02:14:57,199 --> 02:14:59,430
kind of real politic idea that humans
are violent large groups of humans

6844
02:14:59,430 --> 02:14:59,440
are violent large groups of humans
 

6845
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:01,830
are violent large groups of humans
become violent they become irrational

6846
02:15:01,830 --> 02:15:01,840
become violent they become irrational
 

6847
02:15:01,840 --> 02:15:03,310
become violent they become irrational
specifically those two things rivalrous

6848
02:15:03,310 --> 02:15:03,320
specifically those two things rivalrous
 

6849
02:15:03,320 --> 02:15:05,750
specifically those two things rivalrous
and violent and irrational and so in

6850
02:15:05,750 --> 02:15:05,760
and violent and irrational and so in
 

6851
02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:07,430
and violent and irrational and so in
order to minimize the total amount of

6852
02:15:07,430 --> 02:15:07,440
order to minimize the total amount of
 

6853
02:15:07,440 --> 02:15:08,790
order to minimize the total amount of
violence and have some good decisions

6854
02:15:08,790 --> 02:15:08,800
violence and have some good decisions
 

6855
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:11,390
violence and have some good decisions
they need ruled somehow and that not

6856
02:15:11,390 --> 02:15:11,400
they need ruled somehow and that not
 

6857
02:15:11,400 --> 02:15:13,109
they need ruled somehow and that not
getting that is some kind of naive

6858
02:15:13,109 --> 02:15:13,119
getting that is some kind of naive
 

6859
02:15:13,119 --> 02:15:15,390
getting that is some kind of naive
utopianism that doesn't understand human

6860
02:15:15,390 --> 02:15:15,400
utopianism that doesn't understand human
 

6861
02:15:15,400 --> 02:15:16,830
utopianism that doesn't understand human
nature yet this gets back to like

6862
02:15:16,830 --> 02:15:16,840
nature yet this gets back to like
 

6863
02:15:16,840 --> 02:15:20,109
nature yet this gets back to like
mimesis of Desire as an inexorable thing

6864
02:15:20,109 --> 02:15:20,119
mimesis of Desire as an inexorable thing
 

6865
02:15:20,119 --> 02:15:22,270
mimesis of Desire as an inexorable thing
I think the idea of the masses is

6866
02:15:22,270 --> 02:15:22,280
I think the idea of the masses is
 

6867
02:15:22,280 --> 02:15:24,310
I think the idea of the masses is
actually a kind of

6868
02:15:24,310 --> 02:15:24,320
actually a kind of
 

6869
02:15:24,320 --> 02:15:26,669
actually a kind of
propaganda um that is useful for the

6870
02:15:26,669 --> 02:15:26,679
propaganda um that is useful for the
 

6871
02:15:26,679 --> 02:15:28,589
propaganda um that is useful for the
classes that

6872
02:15:28,589 --> 02:15:28,599
classes that
 

6873
02:15:28,599 --> 02:15:32,310
classes that
control um to popularize the idea that

6874
02:15:32,310 --> 02:15:32,320
control um to popularize the idea that
 

6875
02:15:32,320 --> 02:15:36,510
control um to popularize the idea that
most people are too violent lazy um

6876
02:15:36,510 --> 02:15:36,520
most people are too violent lazy um
 

6877
02:15:36,520 --> 02:15:38,430
most people are too violent lazy um
undisciplined and irrational to make

6878
02:15:38,430 --> 02:15:38,440
undisciplined and irrational to make
 

6879
02:15:38,440 --> 02:15:40,870
undisciplined and irrational to make
good choices and therefore their choices

6880
02:15:40,870 --> 02:15:40,880
good choices and therefore their choices
 

6881
02:15:40,880 --> 02:15:43,430
good choices and therefore their choices
should be sublimated in some kind of way

6882
02:15:43,430 --> 02:15:43,440
should be sublimated in some kind of way
 

6883
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:45,069
should be sublimated in some kind of way
I think that if we look back at these

6884
02:15:45,069 --> 02:15:45,079
I think that if we look back at these
 

6885
02:15:45,079 --> 02:15:46,470
I think that if we look back at these
conditioning

6886
02:15:46,470 --> 02:15:46,480
conditioning
 

6887
02:15:46,480 --> 02:15:50,069
conditioning
environments we can can say Okay so the

6888
02:15:50,069 --> 02:15:50,079
environments we can can say Okay so the
 

6889
02:15:50,079 --> 02:15:52,229
environments we can can say Okay so the
kids

6890
02:15:52,229 --> 02:15:52,239
kids
 

6891
02:15:52,239 --> 02:15:56,310
kids
that go to a really fancy school and

6892
02:15:56,310 --> 02:15:56,320
that go to a really fancy school and
 

6893
02:15:56,320 --> 02:15:57,709
that go to a really fancy school and
have a good developmental environment

6894
02:15:57,709 --> 02:15:57,719
have a good developmental environment
 

6895
02:15:57,719 --> 02:15:59,990
have a good developmental environment
like exitor Academy there's still a

6896
02:15:59,990 --> 02:16:00,000
like exitor Academy there's still a
 

6897
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,390
like exitor Academy there's still a
gaussian distribution of how well they

6898
02:16:01,390 --> 02:16:01,400
gaussian distribution of how well they
 

6899
02:16:01,400 --> 02:16:03,750
gaussian distribution of how well they
do on any particular metric but on

6900
02:16:03,750 --> 02:16:03,760
do on any particular metric but on
 

6901
02:16:03,760 --> 02:16:05,189
do on any particular metric but on
average they become

6902
02:16:05,189 --> 02:16:05,199
average they become
 

6903
02:16:05,199 --> 02:16:07,470
average they become
senators and the worst ones become

6904
02:16:07,470 --> 02:16:07,480
senators and the worst ones become
 

6905
02:16:07,480 --> 02:16:09,470
senators and the worst ones become
high-end lawyers or whatever and then I

6906
02:16:09,470 --> 02:16:09,480
high-end lawyers or whatever and then I
 

6907
02:16:09,480 --> 02:16:10,790
high-end lawyers or whatever and then I
look at an inner city school with a

6908
02:16:10,790 --> 02:16:10,800
look at an inner city school with a
 

6909
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:12,149
look at an inner city school with a
totally different set of things and I

6910
02:16:12,149 --> 02:16:12,159
totally different set of things and I
 

6911
02:16:12,159 --> 02:16:14,229
totally different set of things and I
see a very very differently displaced G

6912
02:16:14,229 --> 02:16:14,239
see a very very differently displaced G
 

6913
02:16:14,239 --> 02:16:15,669
see a very very differently displaced G
distribution but a very different set of

6914
02:16:15,669 --> 02:16:15,679
distribution but a very different set of
 

6915
02:16:15,679 --> 02:16:16,910
distribution but a very different set of
conditioning factors so then I say the

6916
02:16:16,910 --> 02:16:16,920
conditioning factors so then I say the
 

6917
02:16:16,920 --> 02:16:19,109
conditioning factors so then I say the
masses well if all those kids who were

6918
02:16:19,109 --> 02:16:19,119
masses well if all those kids who were
 

6919
02:16:19,119 --> 02:16:20,629
masses well if all those kids who were
one of the parts of the masses got to go

6920
02:16:20,629 --> 02:16:20,639
one of the parts of the masses got to go
 

6921
02:16:20,639 --> 02:16:21,990
one of the parts of the masses got to go
to exitor and have that family and

6922
02:16:21,990 --> 02:16:22,000
to exitor and have that family and
 

6923
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,390
to exitor and have that family and
whatever would they still be the masses

6924
02:16:24,390 --> 02:16:24,400
whatever would they still be the masses
 

6925
02:16:24,400 --> 02:16:27,069
whatever would they still be the masses
um could we actually

6926
02:16:27,069 --> 02:16:27,079
um could we actually
 

6927
02:16:27,079 --> 02:16:30,430
um could we actually
condition more social virtue more civic

6928
02:16:30,430 --> 02:16:30,440
condition more social virtue more civic
 

6929
02:16:30,440 --> 02:16:32,150
condition more social virtue more civic
virtue more orientation towards

6930
02:16:32,150 --> 02:16:32,160
virtue more orientation towards
 

6931

dialectical synthesis more empathy more

6932
02:16:34,990 --> 02:16:35,000
dialectical synthesis more empathy more

yes would that lead to better capacity

6936
02:16:42,150 --> 02:16:42,160
yes would that lead to better capacity
 

6937
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:43,910
yes would that lead to better capacity
for something like participatory

6938
02:16:43,910 --> 02:16:43,920
for something like participatory
 

6939
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:45,990
for something like participatory
governance democracy or Republic or some

6940
02:16:45,990 --> 02:16:46,000
governance democracy or Republic or some
 

6941
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,750
governance democracy or Republic or some
kind of participatory governance

6942
02:16:48,750 --> 02:16:48,760
kind of participatory governance
 

6943
02:16:48,760 --> 02:16:52,669
kind of participatory governance
yes is it necessary for it actually

6944
02:16:52,669 --> 02:16:52,679
yes is it necessary for it actually
 

6945
02:16:52,679 --> 02:16:56,910
yes is it necessary for it actually
yes and is it good for class interests

6946
02:16:56,910 --> 02:16:56,920
yes and is it good for class interests
 

6947
02:16:56,920 --> 02:16:59,790
yes and is it good for class interests
not not really uh By the way when you

6948
02:16:59,790 --> 02:16:59,800
not not really uh By the way when you
 

6949
02:16:59,800 --> 02:17:01,870
not not really uh By the way when you
say class interest this is the powerful

6950
02:17:01,870 --> 02:17:01,880
say class interest this is the powerful
 

6951
02:17:01,880 --> 02:17:04,190
say class interest this is the powerful
leading over the the less powerful that

6952
02:17:04,190 --> 02:17:04,200
leading over the the less powerful that
 

6953
02:17:04,200 --> 02:17:05,469
leading over the the less powerful that
kind of

6954
02:17:05,469 --> 02:17:05,479
kind of
 

6955
02:17:05,479 --> 02:17:07,469
kind of
idea anyone that benefits from

6956
02:17:07,469 --> 02:17:07,479
idea anyone that benefits from
 

6957
02:17:07,479 --> 02:17:11,150
idea anyone that benefits from
asymmetries of power doesn't necessarily

6958
02:17:11,150 --> 02:17:11,160
asymmetries of power doesn't necessarily
 

6959
02:17:11,160 --> 02:17:12,910
asymmetries of power doesn't necessarily
benefit from decreasing those

6960
02:17:12,910 --> 02:17:12,920
benefit from decreasing those
 

6961
02:17:12,920 --> 02:17:14,910
benefit from decreasing those
asymmetries of power and kind of

6962
02:17:14,910 --> 02:17:14,920
asymmetries of power and kind of
 

6963
02:17:14,920 --> 02:17:18,910
asymmetries of power and kind of
increasing the capacity of people more

6964
02:17:18,910 --> 02:17:18,920
increasing the capacity of people more
 

6965
02:17:18,920 --> 02:17:20,509
increasing the capacity of people more
widely

6966
02:17:20,509 --> 02:17:20,519
widely
 

6967
02:17:20,519 --> 02:17:23,750
widely
and um so when we talk

6968
02:17:23,750 --> 02:17:23,760
and um so when we talk
 

6969
02:17:23,760 --> 02:17:25,910
and um so when we talk
about power we're talking about

6970
02:17:25,910 --> 02:17:25,920
about power we're talking about
 

6971
02:17:25,920 --> 02:17:28,389
about power we're talking about
asymmetries in agency influence and

6972
02:17:28,389 --> 02:17:28,399
asymmetries in agency influence and
 

6973
02:17:28,399 --> 02:17:30,950
asymmetries in agency influence and
control you think that hunger for power

6974
02:17:30,950 --> 02:17:30,960
control you think that hunger for power
 

6975
02:17:30,960 --> 02:17:33,709
control you think that hunger for power
is fundamental to human nature I think

6976
02:17:33,709 --> 02:17:33,719
is fundamental to human nature I think
 

6977
02:17:33,719 --> 02:17:34,950
is fundamental to human nature I think
we should get that straight before we

6978
02:17:34,950 --> 02:17:34,960
we should get that straight before we
 

6979
02:17:34,960 --> 02:17:37,870
we should get that straight before we
talk about other stuff so like uh this

6980
02:17:37,870 --> 02:17:37,880
talk about other stuff so like uh this
 

6981
02:17:37,880 --> 02:17:40,709
talk about other stuff so like uh this
uh this this pickup line that I use it a

6982
02:17:40,709 --> 02:17:40,719
uh this this pickup line that I use it a
 

6983
02:17:40,719 --> 02:17:43,070
uh this this pickup line that I use it a
bar off which is uh power corrupts and

6984
02:17:43,070 --> 02:17:43,080
bar off which is uh power corrupts and
 

6985
02:17:43,080 --> 02:17:45,589
bar off which is uh power corrupts and
absolute power corrupts absolutely is

6986
02:17:45,589 --> 02:17:45,599
absolute power corrupts absolutely is
 

6987
02:17:45,599 --> 02:17:47,629
absolute power corrupts absolutely is
that true or is that just a fancy thing

6988
02:17:47,629 --> 02:17:47,639
that true or is that just a fancy thing
 

6989
02:17:47,639 --> 02:17:50,429
that true or is that just a fancy thing
going to say in modern society there's

6990
02:17:50,429 --> 02:17:50,439
going to say in modern society there's
 

6991
02:17:50,439 --> 02:17:52,830
going to say in modern society there's
something to be said have we changed as

6992
02:17:52,830 --> 02:17:52,840
something to be said have we changed as
 

6993
02:17:52,840 --> 02:17:55,709
something to be said have we changed as
societies over time in terms of how much

6994
02:17:55,709 --> 02:17:55,719
societies over time in terms of how much
 

6995
02:17:55,719 --> 02:17:56,950
societies over time in terms of how much
We crave

6996
02:17:56,950 --> 02:17:56,960
We crave
 

6997
02:17:56,960 --> 02:18:00,830
We crave
power that there is an Impulse towards

6998
02:18:00,830 --> 02:18:00,840
power that there is an Impulse towards
 

6999
02:18:00,840 --> 02:18:02,549
power that there is an Impulse towards
power that is innate in people and can

7000
02:18:02,549 --> 02:18:02,559
power that is innate in people and can
 

7001
02:18:02,559 --> 02:18:04,509
power that is innate in people and can
be conditioned one way the other yes but

7002
02:18:04,509 --> 02:18:04,519
be conditioned one way the other yes but
 

7003
02:18:04,519 --> 02:18:06,309
be conditioned one way the other yes but
you can see that Buddhist Society does a

7004
02:18:06,309 --> 02:18:06,319
you can see that Buddhist Society does a
 

7005
02:18:06,319 --> 02:18:08,790
you can see that Buddhist Society does a
very different thing with it at scale

7006
02:18:08,790 --> 02:18:08,800
very different thing with it at scale
 

7007
02:18:08,800 --> 02:18:10,230
very different thing with it at scale
that you don't end up seeing the

7008
02:18:10,230 --> 02:18:10,240
that you don't end up seeing the
 

7009
02:18:10,240 --> 02:18:13,709
that you don't end up seeing the
emergence of the same types of

7010
02:18:13,709 --> 02:18:13,719
emergence of the same types of
 

7011
02:18:13,719 --> 02:18:15,030
emergence of the same types of
sociopathic

7012
02:18:15,030 --> 02:18:15,040
sociopathic
 

7013
02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:17,709
sociopathic
behavior and particularly then creating

7014
02:18:17,709 --> 02:18:17,719
behavior and particularly then creating
 

7015
02:18:17,719 --> 02:18:19,070
behavior and particularly then creating
sociopathic

7016
02:18:19,070 --> 02:18:19,080
sociopathic
 

7017
02:18:19,080 --> 02:18:24,629
sociopathic
institutions um and so it's like is

7018
02:18:24,629 --> 02:18:24,639
institutions um and so it's like is
 

7019
02:18:24,639 --> 02:18:27,030
institutions um and so it's like is
eating the foods that were rare in our

7020
02:18:27,030 --> 02:18:27,040
eating the foods that were rare in our
 

7021
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:28,549
eating the foods that were rare in our
evolutionary environment that give us

7022
02:18:28,549 --> 02:18:28,559
evolutionary environment that give us
 

7023
02:18:28,559 --> 02:18:30,070
evolutionary environment that give us
more dopamine hit because they were rare

7024
02:18:30,070 --> 02:18:30,080
more dopamine hit because they were rare
 

7025
02:18:30,080 --> 02:18:32,589
more dopamine hit because they were rare
and they're not anymore Salt Fat sugar

7026
02:18:32,589 --> 02:18:32,599
and they're not anymore Salt Fat sugar
 

7027
02:18:32,599 --> 02:18:34,709
and they're not anymore Salt Fat sugar
um is there something pleasurable about

7028
02:18:34,709 --> 02:18:34,719
um is there something pleasurable about
 

7029
02:18:34,719 --> 02:18:36,549
um is there something pleasurable about
those where humans have an orientation

7030
02:18:36,549 --> 02:18:36,559
those where humans have an orientation
 

7031
02:18:36,559 --> 02:18:39,070
those where humans have an orientation
to overeat if they can well the fact

7032
02:18:39,070 --> 02:18:39,080
to overeat if they can well the fact
 

7033
02:18:39,080 --> 02:18:40,790
to overeat if they can well the fact
that there is that possibility doesn't

7034
02:18:40,790 --> 02:18:40,800
that there is that possibility doesn't
 

7035
02:18:40,800 --> 02:18:42,709
that there is that possibility doesn't
mean everyone will obligately be obese

7036
02:18:42,709 --> 02:18:42,719
mean everyone will obligately be obese
 

7037
02:18:42,719 --> 02:18:44,509
mean everyone will obligately be obese
and die of obesity right like it's

7038
02:18:44,509 --> 02:18:44,519
and die of obesity right like it's
 

7039
02:18:44,519 --> 02:18:47,910
and die of obesity right like it's
possible to have a uh a particular

7040
02:18:47,910 --> 02:18:47,920
possible to have a uh a particular
 

7041
02:18:47,920 --> 02:18:49,549
possible to have a uh a particular
impulse and to be able to understand it

7042
02:18:49,549 --> 02:18:49,559
impulse and to be able to understand it
 

7043
02:18:49,559 --> 02:18:51,429
impulse and to be able to understand it
have other ones and be able to balance

7044
02:18:51,429 --> 02:18:51,439
have other ones and be able to balance
 

7045
02:18:51,439 --> 02:18:56,429
have other ones and be able to balance
them and so to say that um power

7046
02:18:56,429 --> 02:18:56,439
them and so to say that um power
 

7047
02:18:56,439 --> 02:18:59,349
them and so to say that um power
dynamics are are obligate in humans and

7048
02:18:59,349 --> 02:18:59,359
dynamics are are obligate in humans and
 

7049
02:18:59,359 --> 02:19:00,830
dynamics are are obligate in humans and
we can't do anything about it is very

7050
02:19:00,830 --> 02:19:00,840
we can't do anything about it is very
 

7051
02:19:00,840 --> 02:19:04,030
we can't do anything about it is very
similar to me to saying like we everyone

7052
02:19:04,030 --> 02:19:04,040
similar to me to saying like we everyone
 

7053
02:19:04,040 --> 02:19:06,190
similar to me to saying like we everyone
is going to be obligately obese yeah so

7054
02:19:06,190 --> 02:19:06,200
is going to be obligately obese yeah so
 

7055
02:19:06,200 --> 02:19:08,110
is going to be obligately obese yeah so
there's some degree to which those the

7056
02:19:08,110 --> 02:19:08,120
there's some degree to which those the
 

7057
02:19:08,120 --> 02:19:09,990
there's some degree to which those the
control those impulses has to do with

7058
02:19:09,990 --> 02:19:10,000
control those impulses has to do with
 

7059
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,309
control those impulses has to do with
the conditioning early in life yes and

7060
02:19:12,309 --> 02:19:12,319
the conditioning early in life yes and
 

7061
02:19:12,319 --> 02:19:14,910
the conditioning early in life yes and
the culture that creates the environment

7062
02:19:14,910 --> 02:19:14,920
the culture that creates the environment
 

7063
02:19:14,920 --> 02:19:16,469
the culture that creates the environment
to be able to do that and then the

7064
02:19:16,469 --> 02:19:16,479
to be able to do that and then the
 

7065
02:19:16,479 --> 02:19:19,270
to be able to do that and then the
recursion on that okay so what if we

7066
02:19:19,270 --> 02:19:19,280
recursion on that okay so what if we
 

7067
02:19:19,280 --> 02:19:22,389
recursion on that okay so what if we
were to uh bear with me just asking for

7068
02:19:22,389 --> 02:19:22,399
were to uh bear with me just asking for
 

7069
02:19:22,399 --> 02:19:24,030
were to uh bear with me just asking for
a friend if we were to kill all humans

7070
02:19:24,030 --> 02:19:24,040
a friend if we were to kill all humans
 

7071
02:19:24,040 --> 02:19:28,309
a friend if we were to kill all humans
on Earth and then start

7072
02:19:28,309 --> 02:19:28,319

 

7073
02:19:28,319 --> 02:19:31,469

over is there ideas about how to build

7074
02:19:31,469 --> 02:19:31,479
over is there ideas about how to build
 

7075
02:19:31,479 --> 02:19:33,230
over is there ideas about how to build
up okay we don't have to kill let's

7076
02:19:33,230 --> 02:19:33,240
up okay we don't have to kill let's
 

7077
02:19:33,240 --> 02:19:35,190
up okay we don't have to kill let's
leave the humans on Earth they're fine

7078
02:19:35,190 --> 02:19:35,200
leave the humans on Earth they're fine
 

7079
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:37,990
leave the humans on Earth they're fine
and go to Mars and start a new

7080
02:19:37,990 --> 02:19:38,000
and go to Mars and start a new
 

7081
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,549
and go to Mars and start a new
Society is there ways to construct

7082
02:19:40,549 --> 02:19:40,559
Society is there ways to construct
 

7083
02:19:40,559 --> 02:19:42,669
Society is there ways to construct
systems of conditioning

7084
02:19:42,669 --> 02:19:42,679
systems of conditioning
 

7085
02:19:42,679 --> 02:19:46,110
systems of conditioning
education of how we live with each

7086
02:19:46,110 --> 02:19:46,120
education of how we live with each
 

7087
02:19:46,120 --> 02:19:48,950
education of how we live with each
other that would

7088
02:19:48,950 --> 02:19:48,960
other that would
 

7089
02:19:48,960 --> 02:19:52,990
other that would

one piece every 15 minutes as we go

7180
02:21:40,710 --> 02:21:40,720
one piece every 15 minutes as we go
 

7181
02:21:40,720 --> 02:21:45,710
one piece every 15 minutes as we go
thank you um

7182
02:21:45,710 --> 02:21:45,720

 

7183
02:21:45,720 --> 02:21:50,270

so it's easy easier to

7184
02:21:50,270 --> 02:21:50,280

 

7185
02:21:50,280 --> 02:21:52,230

measure there are problems with this

7186
02:21:52,230 --> 02:21:52,240
measure there are problems with this
 

7187
02:21:52,240 --> 02:21:54,150
measure there are problems with this
argument but there's also utility to it

7188
02:21:54,150 --> 02:21:54,160
argument but there's also utility to it
 

7189
02:21:54,160 --> 02:21:58,150
argument but there's also utility to it
so let's take it for the utility it has

7190
02:21:58,150 --> 02:21:58,160
so let's take it for the utility it has
 

7191
02:21:58,160 --> 02:22:00,710
so let's take it for the utility it has

first it's harder to measure happiness
 

7193
02:22:00,720 --> 02:22:03,070
first it's harder to measure happiness
than it is to measure

than it is to measure
 

7195
02:22:03,080 --> 02:22:06,550
than it is to measure
Comfort uh we can measure with

making the car bounce less that the bed
 

7201
02:22:11,040 --> 02:22:14,510
making the car bounce less that the bed
is um softer and you know Material

7202
02:22:14,510 --> 02:22:14,520
is um softer and you know Material
 

7203
02:22:14,520 --> 02:22:16,389
is um softer and you know Material

02:22:57,230 --> 02:22:57,240
to measure Comfort it's pretty Universal
 

7249
02:22:57,240 --> 02:22:58,990
to measure Comfort it's pretty Universal
and I think we can see that the

7250
02:22:58,990 --> 02:22:59,000
and I think we can see that the
 

7251
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,190
and I think we can see that the
Industrial Revolution started to replace

7252
02:23:01,190 --> 02:23:01,200
Industrial Revolution started to replace
 

7253
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:03,870
Industrial Revolution started to replace
happiness with Comfort quite heavily as

7254
02:23:03,870 --> 02:23:03,880
happiness with Comfort quite heavily as
 

7255
02:23:03,880 --> 02:23:05,469
happiness with Comfort quite heavily as
the thing it was optimizing for and we

7256
02:23:05,469 --> 02:23:05,479
the thing it was optimizing for and we
 

7257
02:23:05,479 --> 02:23:07,429
the thing it was optimizing for and we
can see that when increased Comfort is

7258
02:23:07,429 --> 02:23:07,439
can see that when increased Comfort is
 

7259
02:23:07,439 --> 02:23:09,429
can see that when increased Comfort is
given maybe because of the evolutionary

7260
02:23:09,429 --> 02:23:09,439
given maybe because of the evolutionary
 

7261
02:23:09,439 --> 02:23:12,070
given maybe because of the evolutionary
disposition that expending extra

7262
02:23:12,070 --> 02:23:12,080
disposition that expending extra
 

7263
02:23:12,080 --> 02:23:13,750
disposition that expending extra
calories when for the majority of our

7264
02:23:13,750 --> 02:23:13,760
calories when for the majority of our
 

7265
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:15,309
calories when for the majority of our
history we didn't have extra calories

7266
02:23:15,309 --> 02:23:15,319
history we didn't have extra calories
 

7267
02:23:15,319 --> 02:23:19,030
history we didn't have extra calories
was not a safe thing to do who knows why

7268
02:23:19,030 --> 02:23:19,040
was not a safe thing to do who knows why
 

7269
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:21,950
was not a safe thing to do who knows why
um when extra Comfort is given it's very

7270
02:23:21,950 --> 02:23:21,960
um when extra Comfort is given it's very
 

7271
02:23:21,960 --> 02:23:24,710
um when extra Comfort is given it's very
easy to take that path even if it's not

7272
02:23:24,710 --> 02:23:24,720
easy to take that path even if it's not
 

7273
02:23:24,720 --> 02:23:26,830
easy to take that path even if it's not
the path that supports overall

7274
02:23:26,830 --> 02:23:26,840
the path that supports overall
 

7275
02:23:26,840 --> 02:23:27,870
the path that supports overall
well-being

7276
02:23:27,870 --> 02:23:27,880
well-being
 

7277
02:23:27,880 --> 02:23:32,950
well-being
longterm and um so we can see that you

7278
02:23:32,950 --> 02:23:32,960
longterm and um so we can see that you
 

7279
02:23:32,960 --> 02:23:35,670
longterm and um so we can see that you
know when you when you look at the

7280
02:23:35,670 --> 02:23:35,680
know when you when you look at the
 

7281
02:23:35,680 --> 02:23:37,830
know when you when you look at the
Techno Optimist idea that we have better

7282
02:23:37,830 --> 02:23:37,840
Techno Optimist idea that we have better
 

7283
02:23:37,840 --> 02:23:40,269
Techno Optimist idea that we have better
lives than Egyptian pharaohs and kings

7284
02:23:40,269 --> 02:23:40,279
lives than Egyptian pharaohs and kings
 

7285
02:23:40,279 --> 02:23:41,469
lives than Egyptian pharaohs and kings
and whatever what they're largely

7286
02:23:41,469 --> 02:23:41,479
and whatever what they're largely
 

7287
02:23:41,479 --> 02:23:45,309
and whatever what they're largely
looking at is how comfortable our beds

7288
02:23:45,309 --> 02:23:45,319
looking at is how comfortable our beds
 

7289
02:23:45,319 --> 02:23:47,230
looking at is how comfortable our beds
are and how comfortable the transport

7290
02:23:47,230 --> 02:23:47,240
are and how comfortable the transport
 

7291
02:23:47,240 --> 02:23:48,510
are and how comfortable the transport
ation systems are and things like that

7292
02:23:48,510 --> 02:23:48,520
ation systems are and things like that
 

7293
02:23:48,520 --> 02:23:49,710
ation systems are and things like that
in which case there's massive

7294
02:23:49,710 --> 02:23:49,720
in which case there's massive
 

7295
02:23:49,720 --> 02:23:51,230
in which case there's massive
Improvement but we also see that in some

7296
02:23:51,230 --> 02:23:51,240
Improvement but we also see that in some
 

7297
02:23:51,240 --> 02:23:53,309
Improvement but we also see that in some
of the Nations where people have access

7298
02:23:53,309 --> 02:23:53,319
of the Nations where people have access
 

7299
02:23:53,319 --> 02:23:54,950
of the Nations where people have access
to the most Comfort suicide and mental

7300
02:23:54,950 --> 02:23:54,960
to the most Comfort suicide and mental
 

7301
02:23:54,960 --> 02:23:56,230
to the most Comfort suicide and mental
illness of the

7302
02:23:56,230 --> 02:23:56,240
illness of the
 

7303
02:23:56,240 --> 02:23:59,110
illness of the
highest and we also see that some of the

7304
02:23:59,110 --> 02:23:59,120
highest and we also see that some of the
 

7305
02:23:59,120 --> 02:24:00,990
highest and we also see that some of the
happiest cultures are actually some of

7306
02:24:00,990 --> 02:24:01,000
happiest cultures are actually some of
 

7307
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:02,990
happiest cultures are actually some of
the ones that are in materially lame

7308
02:24:02,990 --> 02:24:03,000
the ones that are in materially lame
 

7309
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:04,910
the ones that are in materially lame
environments and so there's a very

7310
02:24:04,910 --> 02:24:04,920
environments and so there's a very
 

7311
02:24:04,920 --> 02:24:07,429
environments and so there's a very
interesting question here and if I

7312
02:24:07,429 --> 02:24:07,439
interesting question here and if I
 

7313
02:24:07,439 --> 02:24:10,070
interesting question here and if I
understand correctly you do cold showers

7314
02:24:10,070 --> 02:24:10,080
understand correctly you do cold showers
 

7315
02:24:10,080 --> 02:24:11,750
understand correctly you do cold showers
and Joe Rogan was talking about how he

7316
02:24:11,750 --> 02:24:11,760
and Joe Rogan was talking about how he
 

7317
02:24:11,760 --> 02:24:14,429
and Joe Rogan was talking about how he
needs to do some fairly intensive kind

7318
02:24:14,429 --> 02:24:14,439
needs to do some fairly intensive kind
 

7319
02:24:14,439 --> 02:24:18,230
needs to do some fairly intensive kind

actually induce being better as a person

7322
02:24:20,429 --> 02:24:20,439
actually induce being better as a person

actually induce being better as a person
this concept of hormesis that it's

7324
02:24:23,790 --> 02:24:23,800
this concept of hormesis that it's
 

7325
02:24:23,800 --> 02:24:26,269
this concept of hormesis that it's
actually stressing an Adaptive system

7326
02:24:26,269 --> 02:24:26,279
actually stressing an Adaptive system
 

7327
02:24:26,279 --> 02:24:28,429
actually stressing an Adaptive system
that increases its adaptive capacity and

7328
02:24:28,429 --> 02:24:28,439
that increases its adaptive capacity and
 

7329
02:24:28,439 --> 02:24:30,990
that increases its adaptive capacity and
that there's something that the

7330

that there's something that the
 

7331

which requires a decent bit of

which requires a decent bit of

which requires a decent bit of

presence of the Comfort solution it's
 

7343
02:24:44,279 --> 02:24:46,269
presence of the Comfort solution it's
very hard to not choose it and then as

7344
02:24:46,269 --> 02:24:46,279
very hard to not choose it and then as
 

7345
02:24:46,279 --> 02:24:48,070
very hard to not choose it and then as
you're choosing it regularly to actually

7346
02:24:48,070 --> 02:24:48,080
you're choosing it regularly to actually
 

7347
02:24:48,080 --> 02:24:50,429
you're choosing it regularly to actually
downregulate your overall adaptive

7348

downregulate your overall adaptive
 

7349

so when we start saying can

7352
02:24:55,750 --> 02:24:55,760
so when we start saying can

02:24:55,760 --> 02:25:00,070
so when we start saying can
we make Tech where we're measuring for

we make Tech where we're measuring for

we make Tech where we're measuring for
the things that it produces Beyond just

business are all the meaningful things
 

7367
02:25:14,720 --> 02:25:16,550
business are all the meaningful things
measurable and what are the right

02:25:16,550 --> 02:25:16,560
measurable and what are the right
 

7369
02:25:16,560 --> 02:25:17,590
measurable and what are the right

7370
02:25:17,590 --> 02:25:17,600
measures
 

7371
02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:19,230
measures
and what are the externalities of

7372
02:25:19,230 --> 02:25:19,240
and what are the externalities of
 

7373
02:25:19,240 --> 02:25:21,309
and what are the externalities of
optimizing for that measurement set what

7374
02:25:21,309 --> 02:25:21,319
optimizing for that measurement set what
 

7375
02:25:21,319 --> 02:25:22,790
optimizing for that measurement set what
meaningful things aren't included in

meaningful things aren't included in
 

7377
02:25:22,800 --> 02:25:24,269
meaningful things aren't included in
that measurement set that might have

7378
02:25:24,269 --> 02:25:24,279
that measurement set that might have
 

7379
02:25:24,279 --> 02:25:26,230
that measurement set that might have
their own externalities these are some

7380
02:25:26,230 --> 02:25:26,240
their own externalities these are some
 

7381
02:25:26,240 --> 02:25:27,269
their own externalities these are some
of the questions we actually have to

7382
02:25:27,269 --> 02:25:27,279
of the questions we actually have to
 

7383
02:25:27,279 --> 02:25:29,110
of the questions we actually have to
take seriously yeah and we I think

7384
02:25:29,110 --> 02:25:29,120
take seriously yeah and we I think
 

7385
02:25:29,120 --> 02:25:31,110
take seriously yeah and we I think
they're answerable questions right

7386
02:25:31,110 --> 02:25:31,120
they're answerable questions right
 

7387
02:25:31,120 --> 02:25:33,389
they're answerable questions right
progressively better not perfect right

7388
02:25:33,389 --> 02:25:33,399
progressively better not perfect right
 

7389
02:25:33,399 --> 02:25:35,750
progressively better not perfect right
so I so first of all let me throw out

7390
02:25:35,750 --> 02:25:35,760
so I so first of all let me throw out
 

7391
02:25:35,760 --> 02:25:36,990
so I so first of all let me throw out
happiness and comfort out of the

7392
02:25:36,990 --> 02:25:37,000
happiness and comfort out of the
 

7393
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,510
happiness and comfort out of the
discussion those seems like useless the

7394
02:25:39,510 --> 02:25:39,520
discussion those seems like useless the
 

7395
02:25:39,520 --> 02:25:41,790
discussion those seems like useless the
distinction so I because I said they're

7396
02:25:41,790 --> 02:25:41,800
distinction so I because I said they're
 

7397
02:25:41,800 --> 02:25:44,550
distinction so I because I said they're
useful well-being is useful but I think

7398
02:25:44,550 --> 02:25:44,560
useful well-being is useful but I think
 

7399
02:25:44,560 --> 02:25:45,870
useful well-being is useful but I think
I I take it

7400
02:25:45,870 --> 02:25:45,880
I I take it
 

7401
02:25:45,880 --> 02:25:49,469
I I take it
back I'm I knew uh I proposed new

7402
02:25:49,469 --> 02:25:49,479
back I'm I knew uh I proposed new
 

7403
02:25:49,479 --> 02:25:52,429
back I'm I knew uh I proposed new
metrics in this uh brainstorm session

7404
02:25:52,429 --> 02:25:52,439
metrics in this uh brainstorm session
 

7405
02:25:52,439 --> 02:25:58,030
metrics in this uh brainstorm session
which is uh so one is like personal

7406
02:25:58,030 --> 02:25:58,040
which is uh so one is like personal
 

7407
02:25:58,040 --> 02:26:01,190
which is uh so one is like personal
growth which is intellectual growth I

7408
02:26:01,190 --> 02:26:01,200
growth which is intellectual growth I
 

7409
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:04,510

think we're able to make that concrete

7410
02:26:04,510 --> 02:26:04,520
think we're able to make that concrete
 

7411
02:26:04,520 --> 02:26:06,910
think we're able to make that concrete
for ourselves like you're a better

7412
02:26:06,910 --> 02:26:06,920
for ourselves like you're a better
 

7413
02:26:06,920 --> 02:26:08,190
for ourselves like you're a better
person than you

7414
02:26:08,190 --> 02:26:08,200
person than you
 

7415
02:26:08,200 --> 02:26:11,269
person than you
were a week ago or a worse person than

7416
02:26:11,269 --> 02:26:11,279
were a week ago or a worse person than
 

7417
02:26:11,279 --> 02:26:13,550
were a week ago or a worse person than
you were a week ago I think we can

7418
02:26:13,550 --> 02:26:13,560
you were a week ago I think we can
 

7419
02:26:13,560 --> 02:26:16,630
you were a week ago I think we can
ourselves report that and and and

7420
02:26:16,630 --> 02:26:16,640
ourselves report that and and and
 

7421
02:26:16,640 --> 02:26:18,150
ourselves report that and and and
understand what that means it's this

7422
02:26:18,150 --> 02:26:18,160
understand what that means it's this
 

7423
02:26:18,160 --> 02:26:20,550
understand what that means it's this
gray area when you try to Define it but

7424
02:26:20,550 --> 02:26:20,560
gray area when you try to Define it but
 

7425
02:26:20,560 --> 02:26:22,150

I think we humans are pretty good at

I think we humans are pretty good at
 

7427
02:26:22,160 --> 02:26:24,030
I think we humans are pretty good at

that because we have a sense an

02:26:24,040 --> 02:26:25,750
that because we have a sense an
idealistic sense of the person we might

7430
02:26:25,750 --> 02:26:25,760
idealistic sense of the person we might
 

7431
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:27,870
idealistic sense of the person we might
be able to become we we all dream of

02:26:27,870 --> 02:26:27,880
be able to become we we all dream of
 

7433
02:26:27,880 --> 02:26:29,510
be able to become we we all dream of
becoming a certain kind of person and I

02:26:29,510 --> 02:26:29,520
becoming a certain kind of person and I
 

7435
02:26:29,520 --> 02:26:32,469
becoming a certain kind of person and I
think we have a sense of getting closer

and not towards that person maybe this
 

7439
02:26:34,359 --> 02:26:36,990
and not towards that person maybe this
is not a great magic fine the other one

02:27:32,840 --> 02:27:34,070
metric we use and why it's not an
adequate metric and because we're

adequate metric and because we're
 

7491
02:27:34,080 --> 02:27:35,830
adequate metric and because we're

harm occurs which is why I would say
 

7553
02:28:38,640 --> 02:28:42,750
harm occurs which is why I would say
that wisdom is something

02:28:57,750 --> 02:28:57,760
offer yeah but another way to say that
 

7565
02:28:57,760 --> 02:29:03,190
offer yeah but another way to say that
is wisdom is uh constantly expanding and

7566
02:29:03,190 --> 02:29:03,200
is wisdom is uh constantly expanding and
 

7567
02:29:03,200 --> 02:29:05,230
is wisdom is uh constantly expanding and
evolving set of

7568
02:29:05,230 --> 02:29:05,240
evolving set of
 

7569
02:29:05,240 --> 02:29:07,190
evolving set of
metrics which means that there is

7570
02:29:07,190 --> 02:29:07,200
metrics which means that there is
 

7571
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:09,030
metrics which means that there is
something in you that is recognizing a

7572
02:29:09,030 --> 02:29:09,040
something in you that is recognizing a
 

7573
02:29:09,040 --> 02:29:10,309
something in you that is recognizing a
new metric that's important that isn't

7574
02:29:10,309 --> 02:29:10,319
new metric that's important that isn't
 

7575
02:29:10,319 --> 02:29:11,870
new metric that's important that isn't
part of that metric set so there's a

7576
02:29:11,870 --> 02:29:11,880
part of that metric set so there's a
 

7577
02:29:11,880 --> 02:29:15,510
part of that metric set so there's a
certain kind of connection discernment

7578
02:29:15,510 --> 02:29:15,520
certain kind of connection discernment
 

7579
02:29:15,520 --> 02:29:18,990
certain kind of connection discernment
awareness and this is Game Theory

7580
02:29:18,990 --> 02:29:19,000
awareness and this is Game Theory
 

7581
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:20,550
awareness and this is Game Theory
there's a girdles incompleteness theem

7582
02:29:20,550 --> 02:29:20,560
there's a girdles incompleteness theem
 

7583
02:29:20,560 --> 02:29:22,269
there's a girdles incompleteness theem
right which is if the system if the set

7584
02:29:22,269 --> 02:29:22,279
right which is if the system if the set
 

7585
02:29:22,279 --> 02:29:23,750
right which is if the system if the set
of things is consistent it won't be

7586
02:29:23,750 --> 02:29:23,760
of things is consistent it won't be
 

7587
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:25,030
of things is consistent it won't be
complete so we're going to keep adding

7588
02:29:25,030 --> 02:29:25,040
complete so we're going to keep adding
 

7589
02:29:25,040 --> 02:29:27,150
complete so we're going to keep adding
to it which is why we were saying

7590
02:29:27,150 --> 02:29:27,160
to it which is why we were saying
 

7591
02:29:27,160 --> 02:29:29,110
to it which is why we were saying
earlier I don't think it's not

7592
02:29:29,110 --> 02:29:29,120
earlier I don't think it's not
 

7593
02:29:29,120 --> 02:29:30,950
earlier I don't think it's not
beautiful and especially if you were

7594
02:29:30,950 --> 02:29:30,960
beautiful and especially if you were
 

7595
02:29:30,960 --> 02:29:32,070
beautiful and especially if you were
just saying one of the metrics you want

7596
02:29:32,070 --> 02:29:32,080
just saying one of the metrics you want
 

7597
02:29:32,080 --> 02:29:33,469
just saying one of the metrics you want
to optimize for at the individual level

7598
02:29:33,469 --> 02:29:33,479
to optimize for at the individual level
 

7599
02:29:33,479 --> 02:29:35,030
to optimize for at the individual level
is becoming right that we're becoming

7600
02:29:35,030 --> 02:29:35,040
is becoming right that we're becoming
 

7601
02:29:35,040 --> 02:29:36,550
is becoming right that we're becoming
more well that's then becomes true for

7602
02:29:36,550 --> 02:29:36,560
more well that's then becomes true for
 

7603
02:29:36,560 --> 02:29:38,269
more well that's then becomes true for
the civilization and our metric sets as

7604
02:29:38,269 --> 02:29:38,279
the civilization and our metric sets as
 

7605
02:29:38,279 --> 02:29:40,990
the civilization and our metric sets as
well yeah and our definition of how to

7606
02:29:40,990 --> 02:29:41,000
well yeah and our definition of how to
 

7607
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:42,469
well yeah and our definition of how to
think about a meaningful life and a

7608
02:29:42,469 --> 02:29:42,479
think about a meaningful life and a
 

7609
02:29:42,479 --> 02:29:44,710
think about a meaningful life and a
meaningful civilization I can tell you

7610
02:29:44,710 --> 02:29:44,720
meaningful civilization I can tell you
 

7611
02:29:44,720 --> 02:29:46,550
meaningful civilization I can tell you
what some of my favorite metrics are

7612
02:29:46,550 --> 02:29:46,560
what some of my favorite metrics are
 

7613
02:29:46,560 --> 02:29:49,590
what some of my favorite metrics are
what's

7614
02:29:49,590 --> 02:29:49,600

 

7615
02:29:49,600 --> 02:29:51,950

that uh well love is obviously not a

7616
02:29:51,950 --> 02:29:51,960
that uh well love is obviously not a
 

7617
02:29:51,960 --> 02:29:54,349
that uh well love is obviously not a
metric it's you can bench yeah it's a

7618
02:29:54,349 --> 02:29:54,359
metric it's you can bench yeah it's a
 

7619
02:29:54,359 --> 02:29:56,150
metric it's you can bench yeah it's a
good metric yeah I want to optimize that

7620
02:29:56,150 --> 02:29:56,160
good metric yeah I want to optimize that
 

7621
02:29:56,160 --> 02:29:57,670
good metric yeah I want to optimize that
across the entire population starting

7622
02:29:57,670 --> 02:29:57,680
across the entire population starting
 

7623
02:29:57,680 --> 02:30:00,349
across the entire population starting
with infants

7624
02:30:00,349 --> 02:30:00,359
with infants
 

7625
02:30:00,359 --> 02:30:02,590
with infants
um

7626
02:30:02,590 --> 02:30:02,600
um
 

7627
02:30:02,600 --> 02:30:04,950
um
so in the same way that love isn't a

7628
02:30:04,950 --> 02:30:04,960
so in the same way that love isn't a
 

7629
02:30:04,960 --> 02:30:06,349
so in the same way that love isn't a
metric but you could make metrics that

7630
02:30:06,349 --> 02:30:06,359
metric but you could make metrics that
 

7631
02:30:06,359 --> 02:30:07,710
metric but you could make metrics that
look at certain parts of it the thing

7632
02:30:07,710 --> 02:30:07,720
look at certain parts of it the thing
 

7633
02:30:07,720 --> 02:30:09,230
look at certain parts of it the thing
I'm about to say isn't a metric but it's

7634
02:30:09,230 --> 02:30:09,240
I'm about to say isn't a metric but it's
 

7635
02:30:09,240 --> 02:30:11,630
I'm about to say isn't a metric but it's
a it's a consideration CU I thought

7636
02:30:11,630 --> 02:30:11,640
a it's a consideration CU I thought
 

7637
02:30:11,640 --> 02:30:13,150
a it's a consideration CU I thought
about this a lot I I don't think there

7638
02:30:13,150 --> 02:30:13,160
about this a lot I I don't think there
 

7639
02:30:13,160 --> 02:30:16,910
about this a lot I I don't think there
is a metric a right one um I think think

7640
02:30:16,910 --> 02:30:16,920
is a metric a right one um I think think
 

7641
02:30:16,920 --> 02:30:18,870
is a metric a right one um I think think
that every metric by itself without this

7642
02:30:18,870 --> 02:30:18,880
that every metric by itself without this
 

7643
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:20,269
that every metric by itself without this
thing we talked about of the continuous

7644
02:30:20,269 --> 02:30:20,279
thing we talked about of the continuous
 

7645
02:30:20,279 --> 02:30:21,670
thing we talked about of the continuous
Improvement becomes a paperclip

7646
02:30:21,670 --> 02:30:21,680
Improvement becomes a paperclip
 

7647
02:30:21,680 --> 02:30:24,750
Improvement becomes a paperclip
maximizer I think that's why what the

7648
02:30:24,750 --> 02:30:24,760
maximizer I think that's why what the
 

7649
02:30:24,760 --> 02:30:27,910
maximizer I think that's why what the
idea of false idol means in terms of the

7650
02:30:27,910 --> 02:30:27,920
idea of false idol means in terms of the
 

7651
02:30:27,920 --> 02:30:29,910
idea of false idol means in terms of the
model of reality not being reality then

7652
02:30:29,910 --> 02:30:29,920
model of reality not being reality then
 

7653
02:30:29,920 --> 02:30:32,030
model of reality not being reality then
my sacred relationship is to reality

7654
02:30:32,030 --> 02:30:32,040
my sacred relationship is to reality
 

7655
02:30:32,040 --> 02:30:33,550
my sacred relationship is to reality
itself which also binds me to the

7656
02:30:33,550 --> 02:30:33,560
itself which also binds me to the
 

7657
02:30:33,560 --> 02:30:35,910
itself which also binds me to the
unknown forever to the known but also to

7658
02:30:35,910 --> 02:30:35,920
unknown forever to the known but also to
 

7659
02:30:35,920 --> 02:30:37,670
unknown forever to the known but also to
the unknown and there's a sense of

7660
02:30:37,670 --> 02:30:37,680
the unknown and there's a sense of
 

7661
02:30:37,680 --> 02:30:39,750
the unknown and there's a sense of
sacredness connected to the unknown that

7662
02:30:39,750 --> 02:30:39,760
sacredness connected to the unknown that
 

7663
02:30:39,760 --> 02:30:41,550
sacredness connected to the unknown that
creates an epistemic humility that is

7664
02:30:41,550 --> 02:30:41,560
creates an epistemic humility that is
 

7665
02:30:41,560 --> 02:30:43,349
creates an epistemic humility that is
always seeking not just to optimize the

7666
02:30:43,349 --> 02:30:43,359
always seeking not just to optimize the
 

7667
02:30:43,359 --> 02:30:45,830
always seeking not just to optimize the
thing I know but to learn new stuff and

7668
02:30:45,830 --> 02:30:45,840
thing I know but to learn new stuff and
 

7669
02:30:45,840 --> 02:30:47,510
thing I know but to learn new stuff and
to be open to perceive reality directly

7670
02:30:47,510 --> 02:30:47,520
to be open to perceive reality directly
 

7671
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:49,030
to be open to perceive reality directly
so my model never becomes sacred my

7672
02:30:49,030 --> 02:30:49,040
so my model never becomes sacred my
 

7673
02:30:49,040 --> 02:30:49,990
so my model never becomes sacred my
model's

7674
02:30:49,990 --> 02:30:50,000
model's
 

7675
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,150
model's
useful my so the model can't be the

7676
02:30:52,150 --> 02:30:52,160
useful my so the model can't be the
 

7677
02:30:52,160 --> 02:30:56,269
useful my so the model can't be the
false idol correct yeah and this is why

7678
02:30:56,269 --> 02:30:56,279
false idol correct yeah and this is why
 

7679
02:30:56,279 --> 02:30:57,990
false idol correct yeah and this is why
the first verse of the TA Ching is the

7680
02:30:57,990 --> 02:30:58,000
the first verse of the TA Ching is the
 

7681
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,510
the first verse of the TA Ching is the
da that is namable is not the Eternal da

7682
02:31:00,510 --> 02:31:00,520
da that is namable is not the Eternal da
 

7683
02:31:00,520 --> 02:31:02,110
da that is namable is not the Eternal da
the naming then can become the source of

7684
02:31:02,110 --> 02:31:02,120
the naming then can become the source of
 

7685
02:31:02,120 --> 02:31:03,830
the naming then can become the source of
the 10,000 things that if you get too

7686
02:31:03,830 --> 02:31:03,840
the 10,000 things that if you get too
 

7687
02:31:03,840 --> 02:31:04,990
the 10,000 things that if you get too
carried away with it can actually

7688
02:31:04,990 --> 02:31:05,000
carried away with it can actually
 

7689
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:06,710
carried away with it can actually
obscure you from paying attention to

7690
02:31:06,710 --> 02:31:06,720
obscure you from paying attention to
 

7691
02:31:06,720 --> 02:31:09,710
obscure you from paying attention to
reality Beyond in the models it sounds a

02:31:39,240 --> 02:31:40,710
you've been okay so far you've been
doing wonderfully so what's your

7720
02:31:40,710 --> 02:31:40,720
doing wonderfully so what's your
 

7721
02:31:40,720 --> 02:31:42,349
doing wonderfully so what's your
favorite metrics that's why I know

7722
02:31:42,349 --> 02:31:42,359
favorite metrics that's why I know
 

7723
02:31:42,359 --> 02:31:45,349
favorite metrics that's why I know
you're not a Rob passing the test so one

7724
02:31:45,349 --> 02:31:45,359
you're not a Rob passing the test so one
 

7725
02:31:45,359 --> 02:31:47,110
you're not a Rob passing the test so one
metric

7726
02:31:47,110 --> 02:31:47,120
metric
 

7727
02:31:47,120 --> 02:31:48,550
metric
and there are problems with this but one

7728
02:31:48,550 --> 02:31:48,560
and there are problems with this but one
 

7729
02:31:48,560 --> 02:31:50,710
and there are problems with this but one
metric that I like to just as a thought

7730
02:31:50,710 --> 02:31:50,720
metric that I like to just as a thought
 

7731
02:31:50,720 --> 02:31:54,429
metric that I like to just as a thought
experiment to consider is because you're

7732
02:31:54,429 --> 02:31:54,439
experiment to consider is because you're
 

7733
02:31:54,439 --> 02:31:56,990
experiment to consider is because you're
actually asking we're I mean I know you

7734
02:31:56,990 --> 02:31:57,000
actually asking we're I mean I know you
 

7735
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,070
actually asking we're I mean I know you
ask your guests about the meaning of

7736
02:31:59,070 --> 02:31:59,080
ask your guests about the meaning of
 

7737
02:31:59,080 --> 02:32:00,309
ask your guests about the meaning of
life because ultimately when you're

7738
02:32:00,309 --> 02:32:00,319
life because ultimately when you're
 

7739
02:32:00,319 --> 02:32:01,590
life because ultimately when you're
design when you're saying what is a

7740
02:32:01,590 --> 02:32:01,600
design when you're saying what is a
 

7741
02:32:01,600 --> 02:32:04,429
design when you're saying what is a
desirable civilization you can't answer

7742
02:32:04,429 --> 02:32:04,439
desirable civilization you can't answer
 

7743
02:32:04,439 --> 02:32:06,110
desirable civilization you can't answer
that without answering what is a

7744
02:32:06,110 --> 02:32:06,120
that without answering what is a
 

7745
02:32:06,120 --> 02:32:09,150
that without answering what is a
meaningful human life and to say what is

7746
02:32:09,150 --> 02:32:09,160
meaningful human life and to say what is
 

7747
02:32:09,160 --> 02:32:10,429
meaningful human life and to say what is
a good civilization because it's going

7748
02:32:10,429 --> 02:32:10,439
a good civilization because it's going
 

7749
02:32:10,439 --> 02:32:15,269
a good civilization because it's going
to be in relationship to that right

7750
02:32:15,269 --> 02:32:15,279
to be in relationship to that right
 

7751
02:32:15,279 --> 02:32:16,950
to be in relationship to that right
um

7752
02:32:16,950 --> 02:32:16,960
um
 

7753
02:32:16,960 --> 02:32:18,750
um
and then you have whatever your answer

7754
02:32:18,750 --> 02:32:18,760
and then you have whatever your answer
 

7755
02:32:18,760 --> 02:32:20,429
and then you have whatever your answer
is how do you know what is the what is

7756
02:32:20,429 --> 02:32:20,439
is how do you know what is the what is
 

7757
02:32:20,439 --> 02:32:23,550
is how do you know what is the what is
the epistemic basis for for postulating

7758
02:32:23,550 --> 02:32:23,560
the epistemic basis for for postulating
 

7759
02:32:23,560 --> 02:32:26,070
the epistemic basis for for postulating
that um there's also a whole another

7760
02:32:26,070 --> 02:32:26,080
that um there's also a whole another
 

7761
02:32:26,080 --> 02:32:28,150
that um there's also a whole another
reason for asking that question I don't

7762
02:32:28,150 --> 02:32:28,160
reason for asking that question I don't
 

7763
02:32:28,160 --> 02:32:30,230
reason for asking that question I don't
I mean that that doesn't even apply to

7764
02:32:30,230 --> 02:32:30,240
I mean that that doesn't even apply to
 

7765
02:32:30,240 --> 02:32:34,070
I mean that that doesn't even apply to
you whatsoever which is it's interesting

7766
02:32:34,070 --> 02:32:34,080
you whatsoever which is it's interesting
 

7767
02:32:34,080 --> 02:32:37,510
you whatsoever which is it's interesting
how few people have been asked

7768
02:32:37,510 --> 02:32:37,520
how few people have been asked
 

7769
02:32:37,520 --> 02:32:39,389
how few people have been asked
questions like

7770
02:32:39,389 --> 02:32:39,399
questions like
 

7771
02:32:39,399 --> 02:32:42,630
questions like
it we we we joke about these questions

7772
02:32:42,630 --> 02:32:42,640
it we we we joke about these questions
 

7773
02:32:42,640 --> 02:32:46,269
it we we we joke about these questions
is silly right it's it's funny to watch

7774
02:32:46,269 --> 02:32:46,279
is silly right it's it's funny to watch
 

7775
02:32:46,279 --> 02:32:48,830
is silly right it's it's funny to watch
watch a person and if I was more of an

7776
02:32:48,830 --> 02:32:48,840
watch a person and if I was more of an
 

7777
02:32:48,840 --> 02:32:51,030
watch a person and if I was more of an
[\h__\h] I would really stick on that

7778
02:32:51,030 --> 02:32:51,040
[\h__\h] I would really stick on that
 

7779
02:32:51,040 --> 02:32:53,429
[\h__\h] I would really stick on that
question right it's it's a silly

7780
02:32:53,429 --> 02:32:53,439
question right it's it's a silly
 

7781
02:32:53,439 --> 02:32:55,750
question right it's it's a silly
question in some sense but like we

7782
02:32:55,750 --> 02:32:55,760
question in some sense but like we
 

7783
02:32:55,760 --> 02:32:58,150
question in some sense but like we
haven't really considered what it means

7784
02:32:58,150 --> 02:32:58,160
haven't really considered what it means
 

7785
02:32:58,160 --> 02:33:00,230
haven't really considered what it means
just a more concrete version of that

7786
02:33:00,230 --> 02:33:00,240
just a more concrete version of that
 

7787
02:33:00,240 --> 02:33:01,950
just a more concrete version of that
question is what is what is a better

7788
02:33:01,950 --> 02:33:01,960
question is what is what is a better
 

7789
02:33:01,960 --> 02:33:03,870
question is what is what is a better
world what is the kind of world we're

7790
02:33:03,870 --> 02:33:03,880
world what is the kind of world we're
 

7791
02:33:03,880 --> 02:33:07,150
world what is the kind of world we're
trying to create really have you really

7792
02:33:07,150 --> 02:33:07,160
trying to create really have you really
 

7793
02:33:07,160 --> 02:33:09,710
trying to create really have you really
thought about I'll give you some kind of

7794
02:33:09,710 --> 02:33:09,720
thought about I'll give you some kind of
 

7795
02:33:09,720 --> 02:33:10,990
thought about I'll give you some kind of
simple answers to that that are

7796
02:33:10,990 --> 02:33:11,000
simple answers to that that are
 

7797
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,429
simple answers to that that are
meaningful to me but let me do the

7798
02:33:13,429 --> 02:33:13,439
meaningful to me but let me do the
 

7799
02:33:13,439 --> 02:33:14,790
meaningful to me but let me do the
societal indices first because they're

7800
02:33:14,790 --> 02:33:14,800
societal indices first because they're
 

7801
02:33:14,800 --> 02:33:17,150
societal indices first because they're
fun yes

7802
02:33:17,150 --> 02:33:17,160
fun yes
 

7803
02:33:17,160 --> 02:33:18,830
fun yes
we should take a note of this meaningful

7804
02:33:18,830 --> 02:33:18,840
we should take a note of this meaningful
 

7805
02:33:18,840 --> 02:33:19,910
we should take a note of this meaningful
thing because it's important to come

7806
02:33:19,910 --> 02:33:19,920
thing because it's important to come
 

7807
02:33:19,920 --> 02:33:22,349
thing because it's important to come
back to are you reminding me to ask you

7808
02:33:22,349 --> 02:33:22,359
back to are you reminding me to ask you
 

7809
02:33:22,359 --> 02:33:25,070
back to are you reminding me to ask you
about the meaning of life

7810
02:33:25,070 --> 02:33:25,080
about the meaning of life
 

7811
02:33:25,080 --> 02:33:29,750
about the meaning of life
noted let me jot that down yeah so um

7812
02:33:29,750 --> 02:33:29,760
noted let me jot that down yeah so um
 

7813
02:33:29,760 --> 02:33:31,269
noted let me jot that down yeah so um
well because I think I stopped tracking

7814
02:33:31,269 --> 02:33:31,279
well because I think I stopped tracking
 

7815
02:33:31,279 --> 02:33:35,349
well because I think I stopped tracking
at like 25 open threads um okay let it

7816
02:33:35,349 --> 02:33:35,359
at like 25 open threads um okay let it
 

7817
02:33:35,359 --> 02:33:39,389
at like 25 open threads um okay let it
all burn one index that I find very

7818
02:33:39,389 --> 02:33:39,399
all burn one index that I find very
 

7819
02:33:39,399 --> 02:33:41,349
all burn one index that I find very
interesting is the inverse correlation

7820
02:33:41,349 --> 02:33:41,359
interesting is the inverse correlation
 

7821
02:33:41,359 --> 02:33:44,150
interesting is the inverse correlation
of addiction within the

7822
02:33:44,150 --> 02:33:44,160
of addiction within the
 

7823
02:33:44,160 --> 02:33:46,910
of addiction within the
society the more a society produces

7824
02:33:46,910 --> 02:33:46,920
society the more a society produces
 

7825
02:33:46,920 --> 02:33:49,630
society the more a society produces
addiction within the people in it the

7826
02:33:49,630 --> 02:33:49,640
addiction within the people in it the
 

7827
02:33:49,640 --> 02:33:52,590
addiction within the people in it the
less healthy I think the society is as a

7828
02:33:52,590 --> 02:33:52,600
less healthy I think the society is as a
 

7829
02:33:52,600 --> 02:33:55,389
less healthy I think the society is as a
pretty fundamental metric and so the

7830
02:33:55,389 --> 02:33:55,399
pretty fundamental metric and so the
 

7831
02:33:55,399 --> 02:33:57,590
pretty fundamental metric and so the
more the individuals feel that there are

7832
02:33:57,590 --> 02:33:57,600
more the individuals feel that there are
 

7833
02:33:57,600 --> 02:34:01,870
more the individuals feel that there are
less compulsive things in com compelling

7834
02:34:01,870 --> 02:34:01,880
less compulsive things in com compelling
 

7835
02:34:01,880 --> 02:34:03,030
less compulsive things in com compelling
them to behave in ways that are

7836
02:34:03,030 --> 02:34:03,040
them to behave in ways that are
 

7837
02:34:03,040 --> 02:34:04,830
them to behave in ways that are
destructive to their own

7838
02:34:04,830 --> 02:34:04,840
destructive to their own
 

7839
02:34:04,840 --> 02:34:07,670
destructive to their own
values uh and in so far as a

7840
02:34:07,670 --> 02:34:07,680
values uh and in so far as a
 

7841
02:34:07,680 --> 02:34:09,230
values uh and in so far as a
civilization is conditioning and

7842
02:34:09,230 --> 02:34:09,240
civilization is conditioning and
 

7843
02:34:09,240 --> 02:34:11,110
civilization is conditioning and
influencing the individuals within

7844
02:34:11,110 --> 02:34:11,120
influencing the individuals within
 

7845
02:34:11,120 --> 02:34:14,950
influencing the individuals within
it the inverse of addiction um broadly

7846
02:34:14,950 --> 02:34:14,960
it the inverse of addiction um broadly
 

7847
02:34:14,960 --> 02:34:17,349
it the inverse of addiction um broadly
defined correct addic

7848
02:34:17,349 --> 02:34:17,359
defined correct addic
 

7849
02:34:17,359 --> 02:34:20,030
defined correct addic
what's it yeah compulsive behavior that

7850
02:34:20,030 --> 02:34:20,040
what's it yeah compulsive behavior that
 

7851
02:34:20,040 --> 02:34:25,990
what's it yeah compulsive behavior that
is destructive towards things that we

7852
02:34:25,990 --> 02:34:26,000

 

7853
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,910

value yeah I think that's a very

7854
02:34:28,910 --> 02:34:28,920
value yeah I think that's a very
 

7855
02:34:28,920 --> 02:34:30,150
value yeah I think that's a very
interesting one to think about that's a

7856
02:34:30,150 --> 02:34:30,160
interesting one to think about that's a
 

7857
02:34:30,160 --> 02:34:31,469
interesting one to think about that's a
really interesting one yeah and this is

7858
02:34:31,469 --> 02:34:31,479
really interesting one yeah and this is
 

7859
02:34:31,479 --> 02:34:33,349
really interesting one yeah and this is
then also where comfort and addiction

7860
02:34:33,349 --> 02:34:33,359
then also where comfort and addiction
 

7861
02:34:33,359 --> 02:34:36,710
then also where comfort and addiction
start to get very close and the ability

7862
02:34:36,710 --> 02:34:36,720
start to get very close and the ability
 

7863
02:34:36,720 --> 02:34:38,429
start to get very close and the ability
to go in the other direction from

7864
02:34:38,429 --> 02:34:38,439
to go in the other direction from
 

7865
02:34:38,439 --> 02:34:40,349
to go in the other direction from
addiction is the ability to be exposed

7866
02:34:40,349 --> 02:34:40,359
addiction is the ability to be exposed
 

7867
02:34:40,359 --> 02:34:42,429
addiction is the ability to be exposed
to hypernormal stimuli and

7868
02:34:42,429 --> 02:34:42,439
to hypernormal stimuli and
 

7869
02:34:42,439 --> 02:34:45,710
to hypernormal stimuli and
not go down the path of desensitizing to

7870
02:34:45,710 --> 02:34:45,720
not go down the path of desensitizing to
 

7871
02:34:45,720 --> 02:34:46,910
not go down the path of desensitizing to
other stimuli and needing that

7872
02:34:46,910 --> 02:34:46,920
other stimuli and needing that
 

7873
02:34:46,920 --> 02:34:49,830
other stimuli and needing that
hypernormal stimuli which does involve a

7874
02:34:49,830 --> 02:34:49,840
hypernormal stimuli which does involve a
 

7875
02:34:49,840 --> 02:34:53,070
hypernormal stimuli which does involve a
kind of hormesis so I do think the

7876
02:34:53,070 --> 02:34:53,080
kind of hormesis so I do think the
 

7877
02:34:53,080 --> 02:34:55,750
kind of hormesis so I do think the
civilization of the future has to

7878
02:34:55,750 --> 02:34:55,760
civilization of the future has to
 

7879
02:34:55,760 --> 02:34:59,469
civilization of the future has to
create something like ritualized

7880

that or not so how do we get the
 

7921
02:35:43,960 --> 02:35:47,389
that or not so how do we get the
benefits of the the stealing of

02:35:50,800 --> 02:35:52,950
whatever that happened from the
difficulty without traumatizing people a

7928
02:35:52,950 --> 02:35:52,960
difficulty without traumatizing people a
 

7929
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:54,429
difficulty without traumatizing people a
certain kind of

7930
02:35:54,429 --> 02:35:54,439
certain kind of
 

7931
02:35:54,439 --> 02:35:56,670
certain kind of
ritualized

7932
02:35:56,670 --> 02:35:56,680
ritualized
 

7933
02:35:56,680 --> 02:36:00,150
ritualized
discomfort that not only has us overcome

7934
02:36:00,150 --> 02:36:00,160
discomfort that not only has us overcome
 

7935
02:36:00,160 --> 02:36:02,309
discomfort that not only has us overcome
something by ourselves but overcome it

7936
02:36:02,309 --> 02:36:02,319
something by ourselves but overcome it
 

7937
02:36:02,319 --> 02:36:03,590
something by ourselves but overcome it
together with each other where nobody

7938
02:36:03,590 --> 02:36:03,600
together with each other where nobody
 

7939
02:36:03,600 --> 02:36:05,030
together with each other where nobody
bailes when it gets hard because the

7940
02:36:05,030 --> 02:36:05,040
bailes when it gets hard because the
 

7941
02:36:05,040 --> 02:36:06,710
bailes when it gets hard because the
other people are there so it's both a

7942
02:36:06,710 --> 02:36:06,720
other people are there so it's both a
 

7943
02:36:06,720 --> 02:36:08,190
other people are there so it's both a
resilience of the individuals and a

7944
02:36:08,190 --> 02:36:08,200
resilience of the individuals and a
 

7945
02:36:08,200 --> 02:36:10,190
resilience of the individuals and a
resilience of the

7946
02:36:10,190 --> 02:36:10,200
resilience of the
 

7947
02:36:10,200 --> 02:36:12,230
resilience of the
bonding so I think we'll keep getting

7948
02:36:12,230 --> 02:36:12,240
bonding so I think we'll keep getting
 

7949
02:36:12,240 --> 02:36:14,230
bonding so I think we'll keep getting
more and more comfortable stuff but we

7950
02:36:14,230 --> 02:36:14,240
more and more comfortable stuff but we
 

7951
02:36:14,240 --> 02:36:16,469
more and more comfortable stuff but we
have to also develop res and the

7952
02:36:16,469 --> 02:36:16,479
have to also develop res and the
 

7953
02:36:16,479 --> 02:36:20,030
have to also develop res and the
presence of that um for the anti-

7954
02:36:20,030 --> 02:36:20,040
presence of that um for the anti-
 

7955
02:36:20,040 --> 02:36:21,910
presence of that um for the anti-
addiction Direction and the fullness of

7956
02:36:21,910 --> 02:36:21,920
addiction Direction and the fullness of
 

7957
02:36:21,920 --> 02:36:24,550
addiction Direction and the fullness of
character um and the trustworthiness to

others so you have to be uh consistently
 

7961
02:36:28,080 --> 02:36:30,070
others so you have to be uh consistently
injecting discomfort into the system

7962
02:36:30,070 --> 02:36:30,080
injecting discomfort into the system
 

7963
02:36:30,080 --> 02:36:32,870
injecting discomfort into the system
ritualize I mean this sounds like uh you

7964
02:36:32,870 --> 02:36:32,880
ritualize I mean this sounds like uh you
 

7965
02:36:32,880 --> 02:36:36,070
ritualize I mean this sounds like uh you
have to imagine Copus happy you have to

7966
02:36:36,070 --> 02:36:36,080
have to imagine Copus happy you have to
 

7967

Rock uh optimally resilient from a

7970
02:36:43,590 --> 02:36:43,600
Rock uh optimally resilient from a
 

7971
02:36:43,600 --> 02:36:46,910
Rock uh optimally resilient from a
metrics perspective in society

7972
02:36:46,910 --> 02:36:46,920
metrics perspective in society
 

7973
02:36:46,920 --> 02:36:49,590
metrics perspective in society
so we we want we want to constantly be

7974
02:36:49,590 --> 02:36:49,600
so we we want we want to constantly be
 

7975
02:36:49,600 --> 02:36:53,070
so we we want we want to constantly be
throwing rocks at ourselves not

7976
02:36:53,070 --> 02:36:53,080
throwing rocks at ourselves not
 

7977
02:36:53,080 --> 02:36:55,870
throwing rocks at ourselves not
constantly uh you didn't have to

7978
02:36:55,870 --> 02:36:55,880
constantly uh you didn't have to
 

7979
02:36:55,880 --> 02:36:58,790
constantly uh you didn't have to
frequently um periodically periodically

7980
02:36:58,790 --> 02:36:58,800
frequently um periodically periodically
 

7981
02:36:58,800 --> 02:37:00,070
frequently um periodically periodically
and there's different levels of

7982
02:37:00,070 --> 02:37:00,080
and there's different levels of
 

7983
02:37:00,080 --> 02:37:01,830
and there's different levels of
intensity different periodicities now I

7984
02:37:01,830 --> 02:37:01,840
intensity different periodicities now I
 

7985
02:37:01,840 --> 02:37:04,510
intensity different periodicities now I
do not think this should be imposed by

7986
02:37:04,510 --> 02:37:04,520
do not think this should be imposed by
 

7987
02:37:04,520 --> 02:37:07,790
do not think this should be imposed by
States uh I think it should emerge from

7988
02:37:07,790 --> 02:37:07,800
States uh I think it should emerge from
 

7989
02:37:07,800 --> 02:37:10,150
States uh I think it should emerge from
cultures and I think the cultures are

7990
02:37:10,150 --> 02:37:10,160
cultures and I think the cultures are
 

7991
02:37:10,160 --> 02:37:11,750
cultures and I think the cultures are
developing people that understand the

7992
02:37:11,750 --> 02:37:11,760
developing people that understand the
 

7993
02:37:11,760 --> 02:37:13,750
developing people that understand the
value of it so the people so there is

7994
02:37:13,750 --> 02:37:13,760
value of it so the people so there is
 

7995
02:37:13,760 --> 02:37:17,349
value of it so the people so there is
both a a cultural cohesion to it but

7996
02:37:17,349 --> 02:37:17,359
both a a cultural cohesion to it but
 

7997
02:37:17,359 --> 02:37:19,230
both a a cultural cohesion to it but
there's also a voluntarism because the

7998
02:37:19,230 --> 02:37:19,240
there's also a voluntarism because the
 

7999
02:37:19,240 --> 02:37:20,990
there's also a voluntarism because the
people value the thing that is being

8000
02:37:20,990 --> 02:37:21,000
people value the thing that is being
 

8001
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:22,550
people value the thing that is being
developed they understand it and that's

8002
02:37:22,550 --> 02:37:22,560
developed they understand it and that's
 

8003
02:37:22,560 --> 02:37:24,510
developed they understand it and that's
what condition so conditioning it's

8004
02:37:24,510 --> 02:37:24,520
what condition so conditioning it's
 

8005
02:37:24,520 --> 02:37:27,110
what condition so conditioning it's
conditioning some of these some of these

8006
02:37:27,110 --> 02:37:27,120
conditioning some of these some of these
 

8007
02:37:27,120 --> 02:37:29,230
conditioning some of these some of these
values and conditioning is a bad word

8008
02:37:29,230 --> 02:37:29,240
values and conditioning is a bad word
 

8009
02:37:29,240 --> 02:37:30,790
values and conditioning is a bad word
because we like our idea of sovereignty

8010
02:37:30,790 --> 02:37:30,800
because we like our idea of sovereignty
 

8011
02:37:30,800 --> 02:37:33,590
because we like our idea of sovereignty
but when we recognize the language that

8012
02:37:33,590 --> 02:37:33,600
but when we recognize the language that
 

8013
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:35,870
but when we recognize the language that
we speak and the words that we think in

8014
02:37:35,870 --> 02:37:35,880
we speak and the words that we think in
 

8015
02:37:35,880 --> 02:37:37,910
we speak and the words that we think in
and the and the patterns of thought

8016
02:37:37,910 --> 02:37:37,920
and the and the patterns of thought
 

8017
02:37:37,920 --> 02:37:39,349
and the and the patterns of thought
built into that language and the

02:37:39,349 --> 02:37:39,359
built into that language and the
 

8019
02:37:39,359 --> 02:37:41,269
built into that language and the
Aesthetics that we like and so much is

8020
02:37:41,269 --> 02:37:41,279
Aesthetics that we like and so much is
 

8021
02:37:41,279 --> 02:37:42,870
Aesthetics that we like and so much is
conditioned in us just based on where

8022
02:37:42,870 --> 02:37:42,880
conditioned in us just based on where
 

8023
02:37:42,880 --> 02:37:44,990
conditioned in us just based on where
we're born you can't not condition

8024
02:37:44,990 --> 02:37:45,000
we're born you can't not condition
 

8025
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:46,469
we're born you can't not condition
people so all you can do is take more

8026
02:37:46,469 --> 02:37:46,479
people so all you can do is take more
 

8027
02:37:46,479 --> 02:37:48,230
people so all you can do is take more
responsibility for what the conditioning

8028
02:37:48,230 --> 02:37:48,240
responsibility for what the conditioning
 

8029
02:37:48,240 --> 02:37:49,630
responsibility for what the conditioning
factors are and then you have to think

8030
02:37:49,630 --> 02:37:49,640
factors are and then you have to think
 

8031
02:37:49,640 --> 02:37:50,670
factors are and then you have to think
about this question of what is a

8032
02:37:50,670 --> 02:37:50,680
about this question of what is a
 

8033
02:37:50,680 --> 02:37:52,870
about this question of what is a

affected by those so then we have to say
 

8047
02:38:02,840 --> 02:38:04,750

the thing I would optimize for now there

8140
02:39:48,630 --> 02:39:48,640
the thing I would optimize for now there
 

8141
02:39:48,640 --> 02:39:51,349

your emotional states are just totally
decoupled and that is like sociopathy I

8146
02:39:57,269 --> 02:39:57,279
decoupled and that is like sociopathy I
 

8147
02:39:57,279 --> 02:39:59,150

02:40:02,389 --> 02:40:02,399
whatever but there's a worst state and
 

8153
02:40:02,399 --> 02:40:03,790
whatever but there's a worst state and
it's extremely common which is where

8154
02:40:03,790 --> 02:40:03,800
it's extremely common which is where
 

8155
02:40:03,800 --> 02:40:05,070
it's extremely common which is where
they're inversely

8156
02:40:05,070 --> 02:40:05,080
they're inversely
 

8157
02:40:05,080 --> 02:40:08,110
they're inversely
coupled where my positive emotions

8158
02:40:08,110 --> 02:40:08,120
coupled where my positive emotions
 

8159
02:40:08,120 --> 02:40:09,750
coupled where my positive emotions
correspond to your negative ones and

correspond to your negative ones and
 

8161
02:40:09,760 --> 02:40:13,550
correspond to your negative ones and
vice versa and that is the I I would

8162
02:40:13,550 --> 02:40:13,560
vice versa and that is the I I would
 

8163
02:40:13,560 --> 02:40:17,070
vice versa and that is the I I would
call it the jealousy sadism axis

8164
02:40:17,070 --> 02:40:17,080
call it the jealousy sadism axis
 

8165
02:40:17,080 --> 02:40:18,870
call it the jealousy sadism axis
the jealousy axis is when you're doing

8166
02:40:18,870 --> 02:40:18,880
the jealousy axis is when you're doing
 

8167
02:40:18,880 --> 02:40:21,469
the jealousy axis is when you're doing
really well I feel something bad I feel

whatever
and that's so

8174
02:40:29,510 --> 02:40:29,520
and that's so
 

8175
02:40:29,520 --> 02:40:32,230
and that's so
common but I think of it is kind of a

8176
02:40:32,230 --> 02:40:32,240
common but I think of it is kind of a
 

8177
02:40:32,240 --> 02:40:35,590
common but I think of it is kind of a

lowgrade Psychopathology that we've just
 

8179
02:40:35,600 --> 02:40:38,349
lowgrade Psychopathology that we've just
normalized the idea that I'm actually

don't seek public attention also but the
that that was that yeah if if there was

8348
02:43:56,150 --> 02:43:56,160
that that was that yeah if if there was
 

8349
02:43:56,160 --> 02:43:57,830
that that was that yeah if if there was
any word that could express what what

8350
02:43:57,830 --> 02:43:57,840
any word that could express what what
 

8351

any word that could express what what
I've learned from Joan white he's been a

8352
02:43:59,950 --> 02:43:59,960
I've learned from Joan white he's been a
 

8353
02:43:59,960 --> 02:44:01,790
I've learned from Joan white he's been a
really inspiring figure is that

8354
02:44:01,790 --> 02:44:01,800
really inspiring figure is that
 

8355
02:44:01,800 --> 02:44:06,510
really inspiring figure is that
compersion and I wish our world was uh

8356
02:44:06,510 --> 02:44:06,520
compersion and I wish our world was uh
 

8357
02:44:06,520 --> 02:44:10,349
compersion and I wish our world was uh
had a lot more of that cuz then

8358
02:44:10,349 --> 02:44:10,359
had a lot more of that cuz then
 

8359
02:44:10,359 --> 02:44:13,950
had a lot more of that cuz then
it I mean my own sorry to go on a small

02:44:13,950 --> 02:44:13,960
it I mean my own sorry to go on a small
 

8361
02:44:13,960 --> 02:44:15,870
it I mean my own sorry to go on a small
tangent but like

8362
02:44:15,870 --> 02:44:15,880
tangent but like
 

8363
02:44:15,880 --> 02:44:18,150
tangent but like
you're speaking how Society should

8364
02:44:18,150 --> 02:44:18,160
you're speaking how Society should

you're speaking how Society should
function but I feel like if you optimize

8366
02:44:21,030 --> 02:44:21,040
function but I feel like if you optimize
 

8367
02:44:21,040 --> 02:44:22,469

for that metric in your own personal

8368
02:44:22,469 --> 02:44:22,479
for that metric in your own personal

right word to use but that's a really

8374
02:44:30,590 --> 02:44:30,600
right word to use but that's a really
 

8375
02:44:30,600 --> 02:44:33,030
right word to use but that's a really
good way to live life you will also

8376
02:44:33,030 --> 02:44:33,040
good way to live life you will also

good way to live life you will also
learn what gets in the way of it right

8378
02:44:36,070 --> 02:44:36,080
learn what gets in the way of it right
 

8379
02:44:36,080 --> 02:44:37,469
learn what gets in the way of it right
and how to work with it that if you

8380
02:44:37,469 --> 02:44:37,479
and how to work with it that if you
 

8381
02:44:37,479 --> 02:44:39,469
and how to work with it that if you
wanted to help try to build systems at

8382
02:44:39,469 --> 02:44:39,479
wanted to help try to build systems at

Technologies to do that you would have

8386
02:44:43,309 --> 02:44:43,319
Technologies to do that you would have
 

8387
02:44:43,319 --> 02:44:45,790
Technologies to do that you would have

cycle between when you get stoked on
 

8397
02:44:52,880 --> 02:44:54,030
cycle between when you get stoked on
other people doing well and then they

8398
02:44:54,030 --> 02:44:54,040
other people doing well and then they
 

8399
02:44:54,040 --> 02:44:55,750
other people doing well and then they
have a similar relationship to you and

8400
02:44:55,750 --> 02:44:55,760
have a similar relationship to you and
 

8401

everyone is in the process of building

02:44:57,040 --> 02:45:00,349
everyone is in the process of building
each other up uh and this is what I

8404
02:45:00,349 --> 02:45:00,359
each other up uh and this is what I
 

8405
02:45:00,359 --> 02:45:02,429
each other up uh and this is what I
would say the healthy version of

8406
02:45:02,429 --> 02:45:02,439
would say the healthy version of
 

8407
02:45:02,439 --> 02:45:04,670
would say the healthy version of
competition is versus the unhealthy

8408
02:45:04,670 --> 02:45:04,680
competition is versus the unhealthy
 

8409
02:45:04,680 --> 02:45:07,389

the root I believe it's a Latin word

8412
02:45:09,790 --> 02:45:09,800
the root I believe it's a Latin word
 

8413
02:45:09,800 --> 02:45:12,550
the root I believe it's a Latin word
that means to strive together and it's

8414
02:45:12,550 --> 02:45:12,560
that means to strive together and it's
 

8415
02:45:12,560 --> 02:45:14,429
that means to strive together and it's
that impulse to of becoming where I want

8416
02:45:14,429 --> 02:45:14,439
that impulse to of becoming where I want
 

8417
02:45:14,439 --> 02:45:16,190
that impulse to of becoming where I want
to become more but I recognize that

8418
02:45:16,190 --> 02:45:16,200
to become more but I recognize that
 

8419
02:45:16,200 --> 02:45:17,950
to become more but I recognize that
there's actually a hormesis there's a

8420
02:45:17,950 --> 02:45:17,960
there's actually a hormesis there's a
 

8421
02:45:17,960 --> 02:45:19,830
there's actually a hormesis there's a
challenge that is needed for me to be

8422
02:45:19,830 --> 02:45:19,840
challenge that is needed for me to be
 

8423
02:45:19,840 --> 02:45:22,790
challenge that is needed for me to be
able to do that but that means that yes

8424
02:45:22,790 --> 02:45:22,800
able to do that but that means that yes
 

8425
02:45:22,800 --> 02:45:24,030
able to do that but that means that yes
there's an Impulse where I'm trying to

8426
02:45:24,030 --> 02:45:24,040
there's an Impulse where I'm trying to
 

8427
02:45:24,040 --> 02:45:25,670
there's an Impulse where I'm trying to
get ahead maybe I'm even trying to win

8428
02:45:25,670 --> 02:45:25,680
get ahead maybe I'm even trying to win
 

8429
02:45:25,680 --> 02:45:27,950
get ahead maybe I'm even trying to win
but I actually want a good opponent and

8430
02:45:27,950 --> 02:45:27,960
but I actually want a good opponent and
 

8431
02:45:27,960 --> 02:45:29,510
but I actually want a good opponent and
I want them to get ahead too because

8432
02:45:29,510 --> 02:45:29,520
I want them to get ahead too because
 

8433
02:45:29,520 --> 02:45:31,150
I want them to get ahead too because
that is where my ongoing becoming

8434
02:45:31,150 --> 02:45:31,160
that is where my ongoing becoming
 

8435
02:45:31,160 --> 02:45:32,630
that is where my ongoing becoming
happens and the win itself will get

8436
02:45:32,630 --> 02:45:32,640
happens and the win itself will get
 

8437
02:45:32,640 --> 02:45:35,670
happens and the win itself will get
boring very quickly the ongoing becoming

8438
02:45:35,670 --> 02:45:35,680
boring very quickly the ongoing becoming
 

8439
02:45:35,680 --> 02:45:37,550
boring very quickly the ongoing becoming
is where there's aliveness and for the

8440
02:45:37,550 --> 02:45:37,560
is where there's aliveness and for the
 

8441
02:45:37,560 --> 02:45:39,309
is where there's aliveness and for the
ongoing becoming they need to have it

8442
02:45:39,309 --> 02:45:39,319
ongoing becoming they need to have it
 

8443
02:45:39,319 --> 02:45:41,070
ongoing becoming they need to have it
too and that's the strive together the

8444
02:45:41,070 --> 02:45:41,080
too and that's the strive together the
 

8445
02:45:41,080 --> 02:45:42,830
too and that's the strive together the
so in the healthy competition I'm stoked

8446
02:45:42,830 --> 02:45:42,840
so in the healthy competition I'm stoked
 

8447
02:45:42,840 --> 02:45:44,630
so in the healthy competition I'm stoked
when they're doing really well cuz my

8448
02:45:44,630 --> 02:45:44,640
when they're doing really well cuz my
 

8449
02:45:44,640 --> 02:45:47,309
when they're doing really well cuz my
becoming is supported by it mhm now this

8450
02:45:47,309 --> 02:45:47,319
becoming is supported by it mhm now this
 

8451
02:45:47,319 --> 02:45:51,150
becoming is supported by it mhm now this
is actually a very nice segue

8452
02:45:51,150 --> 02:45:51,160

 

8453
02:45:51,160 --> 02:45:54,870

into a model I like about what a

8454
02:45:54,870 --> 02:45:54,880
into a model I like about what a
 

8455
02:45:54,880 --> 02:45:57,030
into a model I like about what a
meaningful human life is if you want to

8456
02:45:57,030 --> 02:45:57,040
meaningful human life is if you want to
 

8457
02:45:57,040 --> 02:45:58,870
meaningful human life is if you want to
go

8458
02:45:58,870 --> 02:45:58,880
go
 

8459
02:45:58,880 --> 02:46:01,830
go
there let's go there we can go somewhere

8460
02:46:01,830 --> 02:46:01,840
there let's go there we can go somewhere
 

8461
02:46:01,840 --> 02:46:03,710
there let's go there we can go somewhere
else if you want well I have I have

8462
02:46:03,710 --> 02:46:03,720
else if you want well I have I have
 

8463
02:46:03,720 --> 02:46:05,830
else if you want well I have I have
three things I'm going elsewhere with

8464
02:46:05,830 --> 02:46:05,840
three things I'm going elsewhere with
 

8465
02:46:05,840 --> 02:46:09,030
three things I'm going elsewhere with
but if we were first let us take a short

8466
02:46:09,030 --> 02:46:09,040
but if we were first let us take a short
 

8467
02:46:09,040 --> 02:46:10,550
but if we were first let us take a short
stroll through the park of the meaning

8468
02:46:10,550 --> 02:46:10,560
stroll through the park of the meaning
 

8469
02:46:10,560 --> 02:46:14,389
stroll through the park of the meaning
of life Daniel uh what is a meaningful

8470
02:46:14,389 --> 02:46:14,399
of life Daniel uh what is a meaningful
 

8471
02:46:14,399 --> 02:46:16,269
of life Daniel uh what is a meaningful
life

8472
02:46:16,269 --> 02:46:16,279
life
 

8473
02:46:16,279 --> 02:46:17,510
life
I think

8474
02:46:17,510 --> 02:46:17,520
I think
 

8475
02:46:17,520 --> 02:46:20,190
I think
um the semantics end up mattering

8476
02:46:20,190 --> 02:46:20,200
um the semantics end up mattering
 

8477
02:46:20,200 --> 02:46:21,429
um the semantics end up mattering
because a lot of

8478
02:46:21,429 --> 02:46:21,439
because a lot of
 

8479
02:46:21,439 --> 02:46:24,309
because a lot of
people will take the word meaning and

8480
02:46:24,309 --> 02:46:24,319
people will take the word meaning and
 

8481
02:46:24,319 --> 02:46:26,469
people will take the word meaning and
the word purpose almost

8482
02:46:26,469 --> 02:46:26,479
the word purpose almost
 

8483
02:46:26,479 --> 02:46:28,950
the word purpose almost
interchangeably and they'll talk they'll

8484
02:46:28,950 --> 02:46:28,960
interchangeably and they'll talk they'll
 

8485
02:46:28,960 --> 02:46:30,630
interchangeably and they'll talk they'll
think kind of what is the meaning of my

8486
02:46:30,630 --> 02:46:30,640
think kind of what is the meaning of my
 

8487
02:46:30,640 --> 02:46:31,990
think kind of what is the meaning of my
life what is the meaning of human life

8488
02:46:31,990 --> 02:46:32,000
life what is the meaning of human life
 

8489
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:33,070
life what is the meaning of human life
what is the meaning of life what's the

8490
02:46:33,070 --> 02:46:33,080
what is the meaning of life what's the
 

8491
02:46:33,080 --> 02:46:35,510
what is the meaning of life what's the
meaning of the universe

8492
02:46:35,510 --> 02:46:35,520
meaning of the universe
 

8493
02:46:35,520 --> 02:46:37,590
meaning of the universe
and what is the meaning of existence

8494
02:46:37,590 --> 02:46:37,600
and what is the meaning of existence
 

8495
02:46:37,600 --> 02:46:39,230
and what is the meaning of existence
rather than non-existence so there's a

8496
02:46:39,230 --> 02:46:39,240
rather than non-existence so there's a
 

8497
02:46:39,240 --> 02:46:40,389
rather than non-existence so there's a
lot of kind of existential

8498
02:46:40,389 --> 02:46:40,399
lot of kind of existential
 

8499
02:46:40,399 --> 02:46:42,950
lot of kind of existential
considerations there and I think there's

8500
02:46:42,950 --> 02:46:42,960
considerations there and I think there's
 

8501
02:46:42,960 --> 02:46:44,670
considerations there and I think there's
some cognitive mistakes that are very

8502
02:46:44,670 --> 02:46:44,680
some cognitive mistakes that are very
 

8503
02:46:44,680 --> 02:46:45,950
some cognitive mistakes that are very
easy

8504
02:46:45,950 --> 02:46:45,960
easy
 

8505
02:46:45,960 --> 02:46:49,150
easy
like taking the idea of purpose which is

8506
02:46:49,150 --> 02:46:49,160
like taking the idea of purpose which is
 

8507
02:46:49,160 --> 02:46:51,469
like taking the idea of purpose which is
like a goal which is a utilitarian

8508
02:46:51,469 --> 02:46:51,479
like a goal which is a utilitarian
 

8509
02:46:51,479 --> 02:46:53,190
like a goal which is a utilitarian
concept the purpose of one thing is

8510
02:46:53,190 --> 02:46:53,200
concept the purpose of one thing is
 

8511
02:46:53,200 --> 02:46:54,990
concept the purpose of one thing is
defined in relationship to other things

8512
02:46:54,990 --> 02:46:55,000
defined in relationship to other things
 

8513
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:56,429
defined in relationship to other things
that have assumed

8514
02:46:56,429 --> 02:46:56,439
that have assumed
 

8515
02:46:56,439 --> 02:47:00,030
that have assumed
value um and to say what is the purpose

8516
02:47:00,030 --> 02:47:00,040
value um and to say what is the purpose
 

8517
02:47:00,040 --> 02:47:02,389
value um and to say what is the purpose
of everything well it's a purpose is too

8518
02:47:02,389 --> 02:47:02,399
of everything well it's a purpose is too
 

8519
02:47:02,399 --> 02:47:04,110
of everything well it's a purpose is too
small of a question it's fundamentally a

8520
02:47:04,110 --> 02:47:04,120
small of a question it's fundamentally a
 

8521
02:47:04,120 --> 02:47:05,790
small of a question it's fundamentally a
relative question within everything what

8522
02:47:05,790 --> 02:47:05,800
relative question within everything what
 

8523
02:47:05,800 --> 02:47:07,309
relative question within everything what
is the purpose of one thing relative to

8524
02:47:07,309 --> 02:47:07,319
is the purpose of one thing relative to
 

8525
02:47:07,319 --> 02:47:08,389
is the purpose of one thing relative to
another what is the purpose of

8526
02:47:08,389 --> 02:47:08,399
another what is the purpose of
 

8527
02:47:08,399 --> 02:47:09,710
another what is the purpose of
everything and there's nothing outside

8528
02:47:09,710 --> 02:47:09,720
everything and there's nothing outside
 

8529
02:47:09,720 --> 02:47:11,510
everything and there's nothing outside
of it with which to say it you actually

8530
02:47:11,510 --> 02:47:11,520
of it with which to say it you actually
 

8531
02:47:11,520 --> 02:47:14,190
of it with which to say it you actually
just got to the limits of the utility of

8532
02:47:14,190 --> 02:47:14,200
just got to the limits of the utility of
 

8533
02:47:14,200 --> 02:47:16,510
just got to the limits of the utility of
the concept of purpose it doesn't mean

8534
02:47:16,510 --> 02:47:16,520
the concept of purpose it doesn't mean
 

8535
02:47:16,520 --> 02:47:17,910
the concept of purpose it doesn't mean
it's purposeless in the sense of

8536
02:47:17,910 --> 02:47:17,920
it's purposeless in the sense of
 

8537
02:47:17,920 --> 02:47:19,349
it's purposeless in the sense of
something inside of it being purposeless

8538
02:47:19,349 --> 02:47:19,359
something inside of it being purposeless
 

8539
02:47:19,359 --> 02:47:21,510
something inside of it being purposeless
it means the concept is too small which

8540
02:47:21,510 --> 02:47:21,520
it means the concept is too small which
 

8541
02:47:21,520 --> 02:47:23,230
it means the concept is too small which
is why you end up getting

8542
02:47:23,230 --> 02:47:23,240
is why you end up getting
 

8543
02:47:23,240 --> 02:47:26,469
is why you end up getting
to you know like in dosm talking about

8544
02:47:26,469 --> 02:47:26,479
to you know like in dosm talking about
 

8545
02:47:26,479 --> 02:47:28,950
to you know like in dosm talking about
the nature of it rather the there's a

8546
02:47:28,950 --> 02:47:28,960
the nature of it rather the there's a
 

8547
02:47:28,960 --> 02:47:31,950
the nature of it rather the there's a
fundamental what where the why can't go

8548
02:47:31,950 --> 02:47:31,960
fundamental what where the why can't go
 

8549
02:47:31,960 --> 02:47:36,469
fundamental what where the why can't go
deeper is the nature of it um but uh I'm

8550
02:47:36,469 --> 02:47:36,479
deeper is the nature of it um but uh I'm
 

8551
02:47:36,479 --> 02:47:38,830
deeper is the nature of it um but uh I'm
going to try to speak to a much simpler

8552
02:47:38,830 --> 02:47:38,840
going to try to speak to a much simpler
 

8553
02:47:38,840 --> 02:47:40,429
going to try to speak to a much simpler
part which is when people think about

8554
02:47:40,429 --> 02:47:40,439
part which is when people think about
 

8555
02:47:40,439 --> 02:47:43,110
part which is when people think about
what is a meaningful human life and kind

8556
02:47:43,110 --> 02:47:43,120
what is a meaningful human life and kind
 

8557
02:47:43,120 --> 02:47:44,630
what is a meaningful human life and kind
of if we were to optimize for something

8558
02:47:44,630 --> 02:47:44,640
of if we were to optimize for something
 

8559
02:47:44,640 --> 02:47:47,990
of if we were to optimize for something
at the level of individual life but also

8560
02:47:47,990 --> 02:47:48,000
at the level of individual life but also
 

8561
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:49,389
at the level of individual life but also
how does optimizing for this at the

8562
02:47:49,389 --> 02:47:49,399
how does optimizing for this at the
 

8563
02:47:49,399 --> 02:47:52,790
how does optimizing for this at the
level of the individual life lead to the

8564
02:47:52,790 --> 02:47:52,800
level of the individual life lead to the
 

8565
02:47:52,800 --> 02:47:55,950
level of the individual life lead to the
best Society for in so far as people

8566
02:47:55,950 --> 02:47:55,960
best Society for in so far as people
 

8567
02:47:55,960 --> 02:47:57,670
best Society for in so far as people
living that way affects others and

8568
02:47:57,670 --> 02:47:57,680
living that way affects others and
 

8569
02:47:57,680 --> 02:47:59,990
living that way affects others and
longterm the world as a whole and how

8570
02:47:59,990 --> 02:48:00,000
longterm the world as a whole and how
 

8571
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,349
longterm the world as a whole and how
would we then make a civilization that

8572
02:48:02,349 --> 02:48:02,359
would we then make a civilization that
 

8573
02:48:02,359 --> 02:48:06,150
would we then make a civilization that
was trying to think about these

8574
02:48:06,150 --> 02:48:06,160

 

8575
02:48:06,160 --> 02:48:07,910

things because you can see that there

8576
02:48:07,910 --> 02:48:07,920
things because you can see that there
 

8577
02:48:07,920 --> 02:48:10,670
things because you can see that there
are a lot of dialectics where there's

8578
02:48:10,670 --> 02:48:10,680
are a lot of dialectics where there's
 

8579
02:48:10,680 --> 02:48:13,790
are a lot of dialectics where there's
value on two sides individualism and

8580
02:48:13,790 --> 02:48:13,800
value on two sides individualism and
 

8581
02:48:13,800 --> 02:48:16,670
value on two sides individualism and
collectivism or

8582
02:48:16,670 --> 02:48:16,680
collectivism or
 

8583
02:48:16,680 --> 02:48:19,510
collectivism or
um the ability to accept things and the

8584
02:48:19,510 --> 02:48:19,520
um the ability to accept things and the
 

8585
02:48:19,520 --> 02:48:22,150
um the ability to accept things and the
ability to push harder and whatever and

8586
02:48:22,150 --> 02:48:22,160
ability to push harder and whatever and
 

8587
02:48:22,160 --> 02:48:24,630
ability to push harder and whatever and
there's failure modes on both

8588
02:48:24,630 --> 02:48:24,640
there's failure modes on both
 

8589
02:48:24,640 --> 02:48:26,950
there's failure modes on both
sides and so when you were starting to

8590
02:48:26,950 --> 02:48:26,960
sides and so when you were starting to
 

8591
02:48:26,960 --> 02:48:28,630
sides and so when you were starting to
say okay H individual happiness and

8592
02:48:28,630 --> 02:48:28,640
say okay H individual happiness and
 

8593
02:48:28,640 --> 02:48:30,070
say okay H individual happiness and
you're like wait [\h__\h] sadists can be

8594
02:48:30,070 --> 02:48:30,080
you're like wait [\h__\h] sadists can be
 

8595
02:48:30,080 --> 02:48:31,110
you're like wait [\h__\h] sadists can be
happy while hurting people it's not

8596
02:48:31,110 --> 02:48:31,120
happy while hurting people it's not
 

8597
02:48:31,120 --> 02:48:32,910
happy while hurting people it's not
individual happiness it's love but wait

8598
02:48:32,910 --> 02:48:32,920
individual happiness it's love but wait
 

8599
02:48:32,920 --> 02:48:35,110
individual happiness it's love but wait
some people can self-sacrifice out of

8600
02:48:35,110 --> 02:48:35,120
some people can self-sacrifice out of
 

8601
02:48:35,120 --> 02:48:36,510
some people can self-sacrifice out of
love in a way that actually ends up just

8602
02:48:36,510 --> 02:48:36,520
love in a way that actually ends up just
 

8603
02:48:36,520 --> 02:48:38,990
love in a way that actually ends up just
creating codependency for everybody um

8604
02:48:38,990 --> 02:48:39,000
creating codependency for everybody um
 

8605
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:42,070
creating codependency for everybody um
or okay so so how do we think about all

8606
02:48:42,070 --> 02:48:42,080
or okay so so how do we think about all
 

8607
02:48:42,080 --> 02:48:43,790
or okay so so how do we think about all
those things

8608
02:48:43,790 --> 02:48:43,800
those things
 

8609
02:48:43,800 --> 02:48:46,150
those things
together

8610
02:48:46,150 --> 02:48:46,160
together
 

8611
02:48:46,160 --> 02:48:50,550
together
one like this kind of came to me as a a

8612
02:48:50,550 --> 02:48:50,560
one like this kind of came to me as a a
 

8613
02:48:50,560 --> 02:48:52,750
one like this kind of came to me as a a
simple way that I kind of relate to it

8614
02:48:52,750 --> 02:48:52,760
simple way that I kind of relate to it
 

8615
02:48:52,760 --> 02:48:55,710
simple way that I kind of relate to it
is that a meaningful life involves the

8616
02:48:55,710 --> 02:48:55,720
is that a meaningful life involves the
 

8617
02:48:55,720 --> 02:48:58,469
is that a meaningful life involves the
mode of being the mode of doing and the

8618
02:48:58,469 --> 02:48:58,479
mode of being the mode of doing and the
 

8619
02:48:58,479 --> 02:49:00,750
mode of being the mode of doing and the
mode of becoming and it involves a

8620
02:49:00,750 --> 02:49:00,760
mode of becoming and it involves a
 

8621
02:49:00,760 --> 02:49:03,630
mode of becoming and it involves a
virtuous relationship between those

8622
02:49:03,630 --> 02:49:03,640
virtuous relationship between those
 

8623
02:49:03,640 --> 02:49:05,349
virtuous relationship between those
three

8624
02:49:05,349 --> 02:49:05,359
three
 

8625
02:49:05,359 --> 02:49:09,030
three
and that any of those modes on their own

8626
02:49:09,030 --> 02:49:09,040
and that any of those modes on their own
 

8627
02:49:09,040 --> 02:49:10,550
and that any of those modes on their own
also have failure modes that are not a

8628
02:49:10,550 --> 02:49:10,560
also have failure modes that are not a
 

8629
02:49:10,560 --> 02:49:13,670
also have failure modes that are not a
meaningful life the mode of being the

8630
02:49:13,670 --> 02:49:13,680
meaningful life the mode of being the
 

8631
02:49:13,680 --> 02:49:16,750
meaningful life the mode of being the
way I would describe it

8632
02:49:16,750 --> 02:49:16,760

 

8633
02:49:16,760 --> 02:49:20,110

if if we're talking about um the essence

8634
02:49:20,110 --> 02:49:20,120
if if we're talking about um the essence
 

8635
02:49:20,120 --> 02:49:23,229
if if we're talking about um the essence
of it is about taking in and

8636
02:49:23,229 --> 02:49:23,239
of it is about taking in and
 

8637
02:49:23,239 --> 02:49:24,830
of it is about taking in and
appreciating the beauty of life that is

8638
02:49:24,830 --> 02:49:24,840
appreciating the beauty of life that is
 

8639
02:49:24,840 --> 02:49:28,229
appreciating the beauty of life that is
now it's a mode that is in the moment

8640
02:49:28,229 --> 02:49:28,239
now it's a mode that is in the moment
 

8641
02:49:28,239 --> 02:49:30,550
now it's a mode that is in the moment
and that is largely about being with

8642
02:49:30,550 --> 02:49:30,560
and that is largely about being with
 

8643
02:49:30,560 --> 02:49:31,830
and that is largely about being with
what

8644
02:49:31,830 --> 02:49:31,840
what
 

8645
02:49:31,840 --> 02:49:34,190
what
is it's fundamentally grounded in the

8646
02:49:34,190 --> 02:49:34,200
is it's fundamentally grounded in the
 

8647
02:49:34,200 --> 02:49:35,349
is it's fundamentally grounded in the
nature of experience and the

8648
02:49:35,349 --> 02:49:35,359
nature of experience and the
 

8649
02:49:35,359 --> 02:49:37,750
nature of experience and the
meaningfulness of experience the Prima

8650
02:49:37,750 --> 02:49:37,760
meaningfulness of experience the Prima
 

8651
02:49:37,760 --> 02:49:39,670
meaningfulness of experience the Prima
fascia meaningfulness of when I'm having

8652
02:49:39,670 --> 02:49:39,680
fascia meaningfulness of when I'm having
 

8653
02:49:39,680 --> 02:49:40,830
fascia meaningfulness of when I'm having
this

02:49:40,830 --> 02:49:40,840
this
 

8655
02:49:40,840 --> 02:49:42,870
this
experience I'm not actually asking what

8656
02:49:42,870 --> 02:49:42,880
experience I'm not actually asking what
 

8657

02:49:45,349 --> 02:49:45,359
of
 

8661
02:49:45,359 --> 02:49:47,110
of
I'm full of experiencing it the

8662
02:49:47,110 --> 02:49:47,120
I'm full of experiencing it the
 

8663
02:49:47,120 --> 02:49:49,710
I'm full of experiencing it the
momentary experience the

8664
02:49:49,710 --> 02:49:49,720
momentary experience the
 

8665
02:49:49,720 --> 02:49:52,950
momentary experience the
moment so taking in the beauty of

8666
02:49:52,950 --> 02:49:52,960
moment so taking in the beauty of
 

8667
02:49:52,960 --> 02:49:55,790
moment so taking in the beauty of
life doing is adding to the beauty of

8668
02:49:55,790 --> 02:49:55,800
life doing is adding to the beauty of
 

8669
02:49:55,800 --> 02:49:57,670
life doing is adding to the beauty of
life I'm going to produce some art I'm

8670
02:49:57,670 --> 02:49:57,680
life I'm going to produce some art I'm
 

8671
02:49:57,680 --> 02:49:58,910
life I'm going to produce some art I'm
going to produce some technology that

8672
02:49:58,910 --> 02:49:58,920
going to produce some technology that
 

8673
02:49:58,920 --> 02:50:00,429
going to produce some technology that
will make life easier more beautiful for

8674
02:50:00,429 --> 02:50:00,439
will make life easier more beautiful for
 

8675
02:50:00,439 --> 02:50:02,190
will make life easier more beautiful for
somebody else I'm going

8676
02:50:02,190 --> 02:50:02,200
somebody else I'm going
 

8677
02:50:02,200 --> 02:50:05,710
somebody else I'm going
to uh do some science that will end up

8678
02:50:05,710 --> 02:50:05,720
to uh do some science that will end up
 

8679
02:50:05,720 --> 02:50:07,910
to uh do some science that will end up
leading to better insights or others

8680
02:50:07,910 --> 02:50:07,920
leading to better insights or others
 

8681
02:50:07,920 --> 02:50:09,309
leading to better insights or others
people's ability to appreciate the

8682
02:50:09,309 --> 02:50:09,319
people's ability to appreciate the
 

8683
02:50:09,319 --> 02:50:10,630
people's ability to appreciate the
beauty of life more because they

8684
02:50:10,630 --> 02:50:10,640
beauty of life more because they
 

8685
02:50:10,640 --> 02:50:11,750
beauty of life more because they
understand more about it or whatever it

8686
02:50:11,750 --> 02:50:11,760
understand more about it or whatever it
 

8687
02:50:11,760 --> 02:50:13,510
understand more about it or whatever it
is or protect it right I'm going to

8688
02:50:13,510 --> 02:50:13,520
is or protect it right I'm going to
 

8689
02:50:13,520 --> 02:50:15,550
is or protect it right I'm going to
protect it in some way but that's adding

8690
02:50:15,550 --> 02:50:15,560
protect it in some way but that's adding
 

8691
02:50:15,560 --> 02:50:17,990
protect it in some way but that's adding
to or being in service of the beauty of

8692
02:50:17,990 --> 02:50:18,000
to or being in service of the beauty of
 

8693
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,990
to or being in service of the beauty of
life through our doing and becoming is

8694
02:50:20,990 --> 02:50:21,000
life through our doing and becoming is
 

8695
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:22,990
life through our doing and becoming is
getting better at both of those being

8696
02:50:22,990 --> 02:50:23,000
getting better at both of those being
 

8697
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,190
getting better at both of those being
able to deepen our being which is to be

8698
02:50:25,190 --> 02:50:25,200
able to deepen our being which is to be
 

8699
02:50:25,200 --> 02:50:26,790
able to deepen our being which is to be
able to take in the beauty of life more

8700
02:50:26,790 --> 02:50:26,800
able to take in the beauty of life more
 

8701
02:50:26,800 --> 02:50:29,389
able to take in the beauty of life more
profoundly be more moved by it touched

8702
02:50:29,389 --> 02:50:29,399
profoundly be more moved by it touched
 

8703
02:50:29,399 --> 02:50:32,389
profoundly be more moved by it touched
by it and increasing our capacity with

8704
02:50:32,389 --> 02:50:32,399
by it and increasing our capacity with
 

8705
02:50:32,399 --> 02:50:34,830
by it and increasing our capacity with
doing to add to the beauty of life

8706
02:50:34,830 --> 02:50:34,840
doing to add to the beauty of life
 

8707
02:50:34,840 --> 02:50:36,510
doing to add to the beauty of life
more

8708
02:50:36,510 --> 02:50:36,520
more
 

8709
02:50:36,520 --> 02:50:40,550
more
and so I hold that a meaningful life has

8710
02:50:40,550 --> 02:50:40,560
and so I hold that a meaningful life has
 

8711
02:50:40,560 --> 02:50:43,630
and so I hold that a meaningful life has
to be all three of those and where

8712
02:50:43,630 --> 02:50:43,640
to be all three of those and where
 

8713
02:50:43,640 --> 02:50:45,349
to be all three of those and where
they're not in con conflict with each

8714
02:50:45,349 --> 02:50:45,359
they're not in con conflict with each
 

8715
02:50:45,359 --> 02:50:48,630
they're not in con conflict with each
other ultimately it grounds in being it

8716
02:50:48,630 --> 02:50:48,640
other ultimately it grounds in being it
 

8717
02:50:48,640 --> 02:50:50,389
other ultimately it grounds in being it
grounds in the intrinsic meaningfulness

8718
02:50:50,389 --> 02:50:50,399
grounds in the intrinsic meaningfulness
 

8719
02:50:50,399 --> 02:50:53,309
grounds in the intrinsic meaningfulness
of experience and then my doing is

8720
02:50:53,309 --> 02:50:53,319
of experience and then my doing is
 

8721
02:50:53,319 --> 02:50:55,510
of experience and then my doing is
ultimately something that will be able

8722
02:50:55,510 --> 02:50:55,520
ultimately something that will be able
 

8723
02:50:55,520 --> 02:50:57,590
ultimately something that will be able
to increase the possibility of the

8724
02:50:57,590 --> 02:50:57,600
to increase the possibility of the
 

8725
02:50:57,600 --> 02:50:59,150
to increase the possibility of the
quality of experience for

8726
02:50:59,150 --> 02:50:59,160
quality of experience for
 

8727
02:50:59,160 --> 02:51:02,550
quality of experience for
others and my becoming is a deepening on

8728
02:51:02,550 --> 02:51:02,560
others and my becoming is a deepening on
 

8729
02:51:02,560 --> 02:51:04,790
others and my becoming is a deepening on
those so it grounds an experience and

8730
02:51:04,790 --> 02:51:04,800
those so it grounds an experience and
 

8731
02:51:04,800 --> 02:51:07,830
those so it grounds an experience and
also the evolutionary possibility of

8732
02:51:07,830 --> 02:51:07,840
also the evolutionary possibility of
 

8733
02:51:07,840 --> 02:51:10,910
also the evolutionary possibility of
experience and the point is

8734
02:51:10,910 --> 02:51:10,920
experience and the point is
 

8735
02:51:10,920 --> 02:51:15,070
experience and the point is
to oscillate between these never getting

8736
02:51:15,070 --> 02:51:15,080
to oscillate between these never getting
 

8737
02:51:15,080 --> 02:51:16,229
to oscillate between these never getting
stuck on

8738
02:51:16,229 --> 02:51:16,239
stuck on
 

8739
02:51:16,239 --> 02:51:18,710
stuck on
anyone yeah or I suppose in parallel

8740
02:51:18,710 --> 02:51:18,720
anyone yeah or I suppose in parallel
 

8741
02:51:18,720 --> 02:51:21,030
anyone yeah or I suppose in parallel
well you can't really attention is a

8742
02:51:21,030 --> 02:51:21,040
well you can't really attention is a
 

8743
02:51:21,040 --> 02:51:25,830
well you can't really attention is a
thing you can only allocate

8744
02:51:25,830 --> 02:51:25,840

 

8745
02:51:25,840 --> 02:51:28,070

attention I want

8746
02:51:28,070 --> 02:51:28,080
attention I want
 

8747
02:51:28,080 --> 02:51:30,269
attention I want
moments where I am absorbed in the

8748
02:51:30,269 --> 02:51:30,279
moments where I am absorbed in the
 

8749
02:51:30,279 --> 02:51:31,750
moments where I am absorbed in the
sunset and I'm not thinking about what

8750
02:51:31,750 --> 02:51:31,760
sunset and I'm not thinking about what
 

8751
02:51:31,760 --> 02:51:36,349
sunset and I'm not thinking about what
to do next yeah and then the fullness of

8752
02:51:36,349 --> 02:51:36,359
to do next yeah and then the fullness of
 

8753
02:51:36,359 --> 02:51:38,349
to do next yeah and then the fullness of
that can make it to where my doing

8754
02:51:38,349 --> 02:51:38,359
that can make it to where my doing
 

8755
02:51:38,359 --> 02:51:40,710
that can make it to where my doing
doesn't come from what's in it for me

8756
02:51:40,710 --> 02:51:40,720
doesn't come from what's in it for me
 

8757
02:51:40,720 --> 02:51:43,349
doesn't come from what's in it for me
because I actually feel overwhelmingly

8758
02:51:43,349 --> 02:51:43,359
because I actually feel overwhelmingly
 

8759
02:51:43,359 --> 02:51:45,190
because I actually feel overwhelmingly
full already

8760
02:51:45,190 --> 02:51:45,200
full already
 

8761
02:51:45,200 --> 02:51:48,229
full already
and then it's like how can I how can I

8762
02:51:48,229 --> 02:51:48,239
and then it's like how can I how can I
 

8763
02:51:48,239 --> 02:51:49,710
and then it's like how can I how can I
make life better for other people that

8764
02:51:49,710 --> 02:51:49,720
make life better for other people that
 

8765
02:51:49,720 --> 02:51:51,790
make life better for other people that
don't have as much opportunity as I had

8766
02:51:51,790 --> 02:51:51,800
don't have as much opportunity as I had
 

8767
02:51:51,800 --> 02:51:53,590
don't have as much opportunity as I had
how can I add something wonderful how

8768
02:51:53,590 --> 02:51:53,600
how can I add something wonderful how
 

8769
02:51:53,600 --> 02:51:55,670
how can I add something wonderful how
can I just be in the creative

8770
02:51:55,670 --> 02:51:55,680
can I just be in the creative
 

8771
02:51:55,680 --> 02:51:59,469
can I just be in the creative
process and so I think where the doing

8772
02:51:59,469 --> 02:51:59,479
process and so I think where the doing
 

8773
02:51:59,479 --> 02:52:00,990
process and so I think where the doing
comes from matters and if the doing

8774
02:52:00,990 --> 02:52:01,000
comes from matters and if the doing
 

8775
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,110
comes from matters and if the doing
comes from a fullness of being it's

8776
02:52:03,110 --> 02:52:03,120
comes from a fullness of being it's
 

8777
02:52:03,120 --> 02:52:04,670
comes from a fullness of being it's
inherently going to be paying attention

8778
02:52:04,670 --> 02:52:04,680
inherently going to be paying attention
 

8779
02:52:04,680 --> 02:52:06,229
inherently going to be paying attention
to

8780
02:52:06,229 --> 02:52:06,239
to
 

8781
02:52:06,239 --> 02:52:08,510
to
externalities or it's more oriented to

8782
02:52:08,510 --> 02:52:08,520
externalities or it's more oriented to
 

8783
02:52:08,520 --> 02:52:09,790
externalities or it's more oriented to
do that then if it comes from some

8784
02:52:09,790 --> 02:52:09,800
do that then if it comes from some
 

8785
02:52:09,800 --> 02:52:11,630
do that then if it comes from some
emptiness that is trying to get full in

8786
02:52:11,630 --> 02:52:11,640
emptiness that is trying to get full in
 

8787
02:52:11,640 --> 02:52:12,950
emptiness that is trying to get full in
some way that is willing to cause

8788
02:52:12,950 --> 02:52:12,960
some way that is willing to cause
 

8789
02:52:12,960 --> 02:52:14,710
some way that is willing to cause
sacrifices other places and where chunk

8790
02:52:14,710 --> 02:52:14,720
sacrifices other places and where chunk
 

8791
02:52:14,720 --> 02:52:17,469
sacrifices other places and where chunk
of its attention is internally

8792
02:52:17,469 --> 02:52:17,479
of its attention is internally
 

8793
02:52:17,479 --> 02:52:20,150
of its attention is internally
focused and so when Buddha said desire

8794
02:52:20,150 --> 02:52:20,160
focused and so when Buddha said desire
 

8795
02:52:20,160 --> 02:52:23,070
focused and so when Buddha said desire
is the cause of all suffering then later

8796
02:52:23,070 --> 02:52:23,080
is the cause of all suffering then later
 

8797
02:52:23,080 --> 02:52:25,110
is the cause of all suffering then later
the vow of the bodhisatwa which was to

8798
02:52:25,110 --> 02:52:25,120
the vow of the bodhisatwa which was to
 

8799
02:52:25,120 --> 02:52:26,630
the vow of the bodhisatwa which was to
show up for all sensient beings in

8800
02:52:26,630 --> 02:52:26,640
show up for all sensient beings in
 

8801
02:52:26,640 --> 02:52:29,269
show up for all sensient beings in
Universe forever is a pretty intense

8802
02:52:29,269 --> 02:52:29,279
Universe forever is a pretty intense
 

8803
02:52:29,279 --> 02:52:31,870
Universe forever is a pretty intense
thing like

8804
02:52:31,870 --> 02:52:31,880

 

8805
02:52:31,880 --> 02:52:34,030

desire I would say there is a kind of

8806
02:52:34,030 --> 02:52:34,040
desire I would say there is a kind of
 

8807
02:52:34,040 --> 02:52:35,510
desire I would say there is a kind of
Desire if we think of desire as a basis

8808
02:52:35,510 --> 02:52:35,520
Desire if we think of desire as a basis
 

8809
02:52:35,520 --> 02:52:37,469
Desire if we think of desire as a basis
for movement like a flow or a gradient

8810
02:52:37,469 --> 02:52:37,479
for movement like a flow or a gradient
 

8811
02:52:37,479 --> 02:52:39,070
for movement like a flow or a gradient
there's a kind of Desire that comes from

8812
02:52:39,070 --> 02:52:39,080
there's a kind of Desire that comes from
 

8813
02:52:39,080 --> 02:52:40,870
there's a kind of Desire that comes from
something missing inside seeking

8814
02:52:40,870 --> 02:52:40,880
something missing inside seeking
 

8815
02:52:40,880 --> 02:52:43,070
something missing inside seeking
fulfillment of that in the world that

8816
02:52:43,070 --> 02:52:43,080
fulfillment of that in the world that
 

8817
02:52:43,080 --> 02:52:45,150
fulfillment of that in the world that
ends up being the cause of actions that

8818

03:03:10,910 --> 03:03:10,920
number meaning that for a few hundred
 

9295
03:03:10,920 --> 03:03:12,469
number meaning that for a few hundred
thousand years of human

9296
03:03:12,469 --> 03:03:12,479
thousand years of human
 

9297
03:03:12,479 --> 03:03:15,110
thousand years of human
history all of the groups of humans

9298
03:03:15,110 --> 03:03:15,120
history all of the groups of humans
 

9299
03:03:15,120 --> 03:03:16,910
history all of the groups of humans
mostly stayed under that size and

9300
03:03:16,910 --> 03:03:16,920
mostly stayed under that size and
 

9301
03:03:16,920 --> 03:03:18,150
mostly stayed under that size and
whenever it would get up to that size it

9302
03:03:18,150 --> 03:03:18,160
whenever it would get up to that size it
 

9303
03:03:18,160 --> 03:03:20,190
whenever it would get up to that size it
would end up cleaving and so it seems

9304
03:03:20,190 --> 03:03:20,200
would end up cleaving and so it seems
 

9305
03:03:20,200 --> 03:03:22,309
would end up cleaving and so it seems
like there's a pretty strong and but

9306
03:03:22,309 --> 03:03:22,319
like there's a pretty strong and but
 

9307
03:03:22,319 --> 03:03:23,830
like there's a pretty strong and but
there weren't individual humans out in

9308
03:03:23,830 --> 03:03:23,840
there weren't individual humans out in
 

9309
03:03:23,840 --> 03:03:25,389
there weren't individual humans out in
the wild doing really well right so we

9310
03:03:25,389 --> 03:03:25,399
the wild doing really well right so we
 

9311
03:03:25,399 --> 03:03:27,469
the wild doing really well right so we
were a a group animal but with groups

9312
03:03:27,469 --> 03:03:27,479
were a a group animal but with groups
 

9313
03:03:27,479 --> 03:03:29,990
were a a group animal but with groups
that had a specific size so we could say

9314
03:03:29,990 --> 03:03:30,000
that had a specific size so we could say
 

9315
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:31,870
that had a specific size so we could say
in a way humans were being domesticated

9316
03:03:31,870 --> 03:03:31,880
in a way humans were being domesticated
 

9317
03:03:31,880 --> 03:03:33,389
in a way humans were being domesticated
by those groups they were learning how

9318
03:03:33,389 --> 03:03:33,399
by those groups they were learning how
 

9319
03:03:33,399 --> 03:03:34,910
by those groups they were learning how
to have certain rules to participate

9320
03:03:34,910 --> 03:03:34,920
to have certain rules to participate
 

9321
03:03:34,920 --> 03:03:36,349
to have certain rules to participate
with the group without which you'd get

9322
03:03:36,349 --> 03:03:36,359
with the group without which you'd get
 

9323
03:03:36,359 --> 03:03:38,750
with the group without which you'd get
kicked out but that that's still the

9324
03:03:38,750 --> 03:03:38,760
kicked out but that that's still the
 

9325
03:03:38,760 --> 03:03:41,309
kicked out but that that's still the
wild state of people and and maybe it's

9326
03:03:41,309 --> 03:03:41,319
wild state of people and and maybe it's
 

9327
03:03:41,319 --> 03:03:43,830
wild state of people and and maybe it's
useful to do as a side statement which

9328
03:03:43,830 --> 03:03:43,840
useful to do as a side statement which
 

9329
03:03:43,840 --> 03:03:45,269
useful to do as a side statement which
I've recently looked at a bunch of

9330
03:03:45,269 --> 03:03:45,279
I've recently looked at a bunch of
 

9331
03:03:45,279 --> 03:03:47,950
I've recently looked at a bunch of
papers around donar's number where the

9332
03:03:47,950 --> 03:03:47,960
papers around donar's number where the
 

9333
03:03:47,960 --> 03:03:49,550
papers around donar's number where the
mean is actually 150 if you actually

9334
03:03:49,550 --> 03:03:49,560
mean is actually 150 if you actually
 

9335
03:03:49,560 --> 03:03:51,510
mean is actually 150 if you actually
look at the original paper it's a range

9336
03:03:51,510 --> 03:03:51,520
look at the original paper it's a range
 

9337
03:03:51,520 --> 03:03:54,150
look at the original paper it's a range
it's really a range so it's actually

9338
03:03:54,150 --> 03:03:54,160
it's really a range so it's actually
 

9339
03:03:54,160 --> 03:03:56,309
it's really a range so it's actually
some somewhere under a th so it's a

9340
03:03:56,309 --> 03:03:56,319
some somewhere under a th so it's a
 

9341
03:03:56,319 --> 03:03:58,269
some somewhere under a th so it's a
ranging from like 2 to 500 or whatever

9342
03:03:58,269 --> 03:03:58,279
ranging from like 2 to 500 or whatever
 

9343
03:03:58,279 --> 03:04:01,110
ranging from like 2 to 500 or whatever
it is but like you could argue that the

9344
03:04:01,110 --> 03:04:01,120
it is but like you could argue that the
 

9345
03:04:01,120 --> 03:04:03,510
it is but like you could argue that the
uh I think it actually is exactly two

9346
03:04:03,510 --> 03:04:03,520
uh I think it actually is exactly two
 

9347
03:04:03,520 --> 03:04:07,229
uh I think it actually is exactly two
two the range is 2 to 520 something like

9348
03:04:07,229 --> 03:04:07,239
two the range is 2 to 520 something like
 

9349
03:04:07,239 --> 03:04:10,870
two the range is 2 to 520 something like
that and this is the mean that's taken

9350
03:04:10,870 --> 03:04:10,880
that and this is the mean that's taken
 

9351
03:04:10,880 --> 03:04:14,309
that and this is the mean that's taken
crudely it's not a very good paper the

9352
03:04:14,309 --> 03:04:14,319
crudely it's not a very good paper the
 

9353
03:04:14,319 --> 03:04:16,630
crudely it's not a very good paper the
in terms of the actual numeric

9354
03:04:16,630 --> 03:04:16,640
in terms of the actual numeric
 

9355
03:04:16,640 --> 03:04:19,670
in terms of the actual numeric
numerically speaking but it'd be

9356
03:04:19,670 --> 03:04:19,680
numerically speaking but it'd be
 

9357
03:04:19,680 --> 03:04:22,429
numerically speaking but it'd be
interesting if there's a bunch of dbar

9358
03:04:22,429 --> 03:04:22,439
interesting if there's a bunch of dbar
 

9359
03:04:22,439 --> 03:04:24,710
interesting if there's a bunch of dbar
numbers that could be computed for

9360
03:04:24,710 --> 03:04:24,720
numbers that could be computed for
 

9361
03:04:24,720 --> 03:04:26,150
numbers that could be computed for
particular environments particular

9362
03:04:26,150 --> 03:04:26,160
particular environments particular
 

9363
03:04:26,160 --> 03:04:27,830
particular environments particular
conditions so on it is very true that

9364
03:04:27,830 --> 03:04:27,840
conditions so on it is very true that
 

9365
03:04:27,840 --> 03:04:30,309
conditions so on it is very true that
there are likely to be something small

9366
03:04:30,309 --> 03:04:30,319
there are likely to be something small
 

9367
03:04:30,319 --> 03:04:32,550
there are likely to be something small
you know under a million but it'd be

9368
03:04:32,550 --> 03:04:32,560
you know under a million but it'd be
 

9369
03:04:32,560 --> 03:04:34,550
you know under a million but it'd be
interesting if we can expand that number

9370
03:04:34,550 --> 03:04:34,560
interesting if we can expand that number
 

9371
03:04:34,560 --> 03:04:36,910
interesting if we can expand that number
in interesting ways that will change the

9372
03:04:36,910 --> 03:04:36,920
in interesting ways that will change the
 

9373
03:04:36,920 --> 03:04:38,389
in interesting ways that will change the
fabric of this conversation I just want

9374
03:04:38,389 --> 03:04:38,399
fabric of this conversation I just want
 

9375
03:04:38,399 --> 03:04:39,870
fabric of this conversation I just want
to kind of throw that in there I don't

9376
03:04:39,870 --> 03:04:39,880
to kind of throw that in there I don't
 

9377
03:04:39,880 --> 03:04:42,349
to kind of throw that in there I don't
know the if the 150 is baked in somehow

9378
03:04:42,349 --> 03:04:42,359
know the if the 150 is baked in somehow
 

9379
03:04:42,359 --> 03:04:43,990
know the if the 150 is baked in somehow
in the heart into the heart Ware we can

9380
03:04:43,990 --> 03:04:44,000
in the heart into the heart Ware we can
 

9381
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:45,110
in the heart into the heart Ware we can
talk about some of the things that it

9382
03:04:45,110 --> 03:04:45,120
talk about some of the things that it
 

9383
03:04:45,120 --> 03:04:49,030
talk about some of the things that it
probably has to do with up to a certain

9384
03:04:49,030 --> 03:04:49,040
probably has to do with up to a certain
 

9385
03:04:49,040 --> 03:04:50,790
probably has to do with up to a certain
number of people and this is going to be

9386
03:04:50,790 --> 03:04:50,800
number of people and this is going to be
 

9387
03:04:50,800 --> 03:04:52,349
number of people and this is going to be
variable based on the social

9388
03:04:52,349 --> 03:04:52,359
variable based on the social
 

9389
03:04:52,359 --> 03:04:54,150
variable based on the social
technologies that mediate it to some

9390
03:04:54,150 --> 03:04:54,160
technologies that mediate it to some
 

9391
03:04:54,160 --> 03:04:56,790
technologies that mediate it to some
degree we can talk about that in a

9392
03:04:56,790 --> 03:04:56,800
degree we can talk about that in a
 

9393
03:04:56,800 --> 03:04:58,469
degree we can talk about that in a
minute

9394
03:04:58,469 --> 03:04:58,479
minute
 

9395
03:04:58,479 --> 03:05:01,070
minute
um up to a certain number of people

9396
03:05:01,070 --> 03:05:01,080
um up to a certain number of people
 

9397
03:05:01,080 --> 03:05:03,110
um up to a certain number of people
everybody can know everybody else pretty

9398
03:05:03,110 --> 03:05:03,120
everybody can know everybody else pretty
 

9399
03:05:03,120 --> 03:05:04,910
everybody can know everybody else pretty
intimately so let's go ahead and just

9400
03:05:04,910 --> 03:05:04,920
intimately so let's go ahead and just
 

9401
03:05:04,920 --> 03:05:10,910
intimately so let's go ahead and just
take 150 as a as an average number

9402
03:05:10,910 --> 03:05:10,920

 

9403
03:05:10,920 --> 03:05:12,910

um everybody can know everyone

9404
03:05:12,910 --> 03:05:12,920
um everybody can know everyone
 

9405
03:05:12,920 --> 03:05:17,229
um everybody can know everyone
intimately enough that if your actions

9406
03:05:17,229 --> 03:05:17,239
intimately enough that if your actions
 

9407
03:05:17,239 --> 03:05:18,990
intimately enough that if your actions
made anyone else do poorly it's your

9408
03:05:18,990 --> 03:05:19,000
made anyone else do poorly it's your
 

9409
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:21,229
made anyone else do poorly it's your
extended family and you're stuck living

9410
03:05:21,229 --> 03:05:21,239
extended family and you're stuck living
 

9411
03:05:21,239 --> 03:05:22,710
extended family and you're stuck living
with them and you know who they are and

9412
03:05:22,710 --> 03:05:22,720
with them and you know who they are and
 

9413
03:05:22,720 --> 03:05:24,550
with them and you know who they are and
there's no Anonymous people there's no

9414
03:05:24,550 --> 03:05:24,560
there's no Anonymous people there's no
 

9415
03:05:24,560 --> 03:05:28,510
there's no Anonymous people there's no
just them and over there and that's one

9416
03:05:28,510 --> 03:05:28,520
just them and over there and that's one
 

9417
03:05:28,520 --> 03:05:31,469
just them and over there and that's one
part of what leads to a kind of tribal

9418
03:05:31,469 --> 03:05:31,479
part of what leads to a kind of tribal
 

9419
03:05:31,479 --> 03:05:32,389
part of what leads to a kind of tribal
process where what's good for the

9420
03:05:32,389 --> 03:05:32,399
process where what's good for the
 

9421
03:05:32,399 --> 03:05:33,990
process where what's good for the
individual and good for the whole has a

9422
03:05:33,990 --> 03:05:34,000
individual and good for the whole has a
 

9423
03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:36,950
individual and good for the whole has a
coupling also below that

9424
03:05:36,950 --> 03:05:36,960
coupling also below that
 

9425
03:05:36,960 --> 03:05:39,630
coupling also below that
scale everyone is somewhat aware of what

9426
03:05:39,630 --> 03:05:39,640
scale everyone is somewhat aware of what
 

9427
03:05:39,640 --> 03:05:41,870
scale everyone is somewhat aware of what
everybody else is doing there's not

9428
03:05:41,870 --> 03:05:41,880
everybody else is doing there's not
 

9429
03:05:41,880 --> 03:05:44,269
everybody else is doing there's not
groups that are very siloed

9430
03:05:44,269 --> 03:05:44,279
groups that are very siloed
 

9431
03:05:44,279 --> 03:05:46,030
groups that are very siloed
and as a result it's actually very hard

9432
03:05:46,030 --> 03:05:46,040
and as a result it's actually very hard
 

9433
03:05:46,040 --> 03:05:47,990
and as a result it's actually very hard
to get away with bad behavior there's a

9434
03:05:47,990 --> 03:05:48,000
to get away with bad behavior there's a
 

9435
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:49,590
to get away with bad behavior there's a
force kind of

9436
03:05:49,590 --> 03:05:49,600
force kind of
 

9437
03:05:49,600 --> 03:05:51,670
force kind of
transparency and so you don't need kind

9438
03:05:51,670 --> 03:05:51,680
transparency and so you don't need kind
 

9439
03:05:51,680 --> 03:05:52,750
transparency and so you don't need kind
of like the

9440
03:05:52,750 --> 03:05:52,760
of like the
 

9441
03:05:52,760 --> 03:05:56,229
of like the
state in uh in that way but lying to

9442
03:05:56,229 --> 03:05:56,239
state in uh in that way but lying to
 

9443
03:05:56,239 --> 03:05:57,870
state in uh in that way but lying to
people doesn't actually get you ahead

9444
03:05:57,870 --> 03:05:57,880
people doesn't actually get you ahead
 

9445
03:05:57,880 --> 03:05:59,429
people doesn't actually get you ahead
sociopathic Behavior doesn't get you

9446
03:05:59,429 --> 03:05:59,439
sociopathic Behavior doesn't get you
 

9447
03:05:59,439 --> 03:06:03,429
sociopathic Behavior doesn't get you
ahead because it gets seen and uh so

9448
03:06:03,429 --> 03:06:03,439
ahead because it gets seen and uh so
 

9449
03:06:03,439 --> 03:06:05,070
ahead because it gets seen and uh so
there's a conditioning environment where

9450
03:06:05,070 --> 03:06:05,080
there's a conditioning environment where
 

9451
03:06:05,080 --> 03:06:06,910
there's a conditioning environment where
the individuals behaving in a way that

9452
03:06:06,910 --> 03:06:06,920
the individuals behaving in a way that
 

9453
03:06:06,920 --> 03:06:08,309
the individuals behaving in a way that
is aligned with the interest of the

9454
03:06:08,309 --> 03:06:08,319
is aligned with the interest of the
 

9455
03:06:08,319 --> 03:06:11,469
is aligned with the interest of the
tribe is what gets conditioned when it

9456
03:06:11,469 --> 03:06:11,479
tribe is what gets conditioned when it
 

9457
03:06:11,479 --> 03:06:13,710
tribe is what gets conditioned when it
gets to be a much larger system it

9458
03:06:13,710 --> 03:06:13,720
gets to be a much larger system it
 

9459
03:06:13,720 --> 03:06:16,710
gets to be a much larger system it
becomes easier to hide certain things

9460
03:06:16,710 --> 03:06:16,720
becomes easier to hide certain things
 

9461
03:06:16,720 --> 03:06:18,590
becomes easier to hide certain things
from the group as a whole as well as to

9462
03:06:18,590 --> 03:06:18,600
from the group as a whole as well as to
 

9463
03:06:18,600 --> 03:06:20,389
from the group as a whole as well as to
be less emotionally bound to a bunch of

9464
03:06:20,389 --> 03:06:20,399
be less emotionally bound to a bunch of
 

9465
03:06:20,399 --> 03:06:21,710
be less emotionally bound to a bunch of
anonymous

9466
03:06:21,710 --> 03:06:21,720
anonymous
 

9467
03:06:21,720 --> 03:06:23,830
anonymous
people I would say there's also a

9468
03:06:23,830 --> 03:06:23,840
people I would say there's also a
 

9469
03:06:23,840 --> 03:06:27,510
people I would say there's also a
communication protocol where up to about

9470
03:06:27,510 --> 03:06:27,520
communication protocol where up to about
 

9471
03:06:27,520 --> 03:06:29,990
communication protocol where up to about
that number of people we could all sit

9472
03:06:29,990 --> 03:06:30,000
that number of people we could all sit
 

9473
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:32,309
that number of people we could all sit
around a tribal council and be part of a

9474
03:06:32,309 --> 03:06:32,319
around a tribal council and be part of a
 

9475
03:06:32,319 --> 03:06:33,590
around a tribal council and be part of a
conversation around a really big

9476
03:06:33,590 --> 03:06:33,600
conversation around a really big
 

9477
03:06:33,600 --> 03:06:35,550
conversation around a really big
decision do we migrate do we not migrate

9478
03:06:35,550 --> 03:06:35,560
decision do we migrate do we not migrate
 

9479
03:06:35,560 --> 03:06:37,070
decision do we migrate do we not migrate
do we you know some something like that

9480
03:06:37,070 --> 03:06:37,080
do we you know some something like that
 

9481
03:06:37,080 --> 03:06:40,309
do we you know some something like that
do we get rid of this person and why why

9482
03:06:40,309 --> 03:06:40,319
do we get rid of this person and why why
 

9483
03:06:40,319 --> 03:06:42,190
do we get rid of this person and why why
would I want

9484
03:06:42,190 --> 03:06:42,200
would I want
 

9485
03:06:42,200 --> 03:06:45,950
would I want
to agree to be a part of a larger group

9486
03:06:45,950 --> 03:06:45,960
to agree to be a part of a larger group
 

9487
03:06:45,960 --> 03:06:48,389
to agree to be a part of a larger group
where everyone can't be part of that

9488
03:06:48,389 --> 03:06:48,399
where everyone can't be part of that
 

9489
03:06:48,399 --> 03:06:51,710
where everyone can't be part of that
Council and so I am going to now be

9490
03:06:51,710 --> 03:06:51,720
Council and so I am going to now be
 

9491
03:06:51,720 --> 03:06:53,830
Council and so I am going to now be
subject to law that I have no say in if

9492
03:06:53,830 --> 03:06:53,840
subject to law that I have no say in if
 

9493
03:06:53,840 --> 03:06:55,150
subject to law that I have no say in if
I could be part of a smaller group that

9494
03:06:55,150 --> 03:06:55,160
I could be part of a smaller group that
 

9495
03:06:55,160 --> 03:06:56,710
I could be part of a smaller group that
could still survive and I get a say in

9496
03:06:56,710 --> 03:06:56,720
could still survive and I get a say in
 

9497
03:06:56,720 --> 03:06:58,349
could still survive and I get a say in
the law that I'm subject to so I think

9498
03:06:58,349 --> 03:06:58,359
the law that I'm subject to so I think
 

9499
03:06:58,359 --> 03:07:01,110
the law that I'm subject to so I think
the cleaving and and a way we can look

9500
03:07:01,110 --> 03:07:01,120
the cleaving and and a way we can look
 

9501
03:07:01,120 --> 03:07:02,910
the cleaving and and a way we can look
at it beyond the dunar number two is we

9502
03:07:02,910 --> 03:07:02,920
at it beyond the dunar number two is we
 

9503
03:07:02,920 --> 03:07:05,150
at it beyond the dunar number two is we
can look at that a civilization has

9504
03:07:05,150 --> 03:07:05,160
can look at that a civilization has
 

9505
03:07:05,160 --> 03:07:07,309
can look at that a civilization has
binding energy that is holding them

9506
03:07:07,309 --> 03:07:07,319
binding energy that is holding them
 

9507
03:07:07,319 --> 03:07:08,910
binding energy that is holding them
together and has cleaving energy and if

9508
03:07:08,910 --> 03:07:08,920
together and has cleaving energy and if
 

9509
03:07:08,920 --> 03:07:10,469
together and has cleaving energy and if
the binding energy exceeds the cleaving

9510
03:07:10,469 --> 03:07:10,479
the binding energy exceeds the cleaving
 

9511
03:07:10,479 --> 03:07:12,830
the binding energy exceeds the cleaving
energy that Civilization will last and

9512
03:07:12,830 --> 03:07:12,840
energy that Civilization will last and
 

9513
03:07:12,840 --> 03:07:14,910
energy that Civilization will last and
so are things that we can do to decrease

9514
03:07:14,910 --> 03:07:14,920
so are things that we can do to decrease
 

9515
03:07:14,920 --> 03:07:16,429
so are things that we can do to decrease
the cleaving energy within the society

9516
03:07:16,429 --> 03:07:16,439
the cleaving energy within the society
 

9517
03:07:16,439 --> 03:07:17,710
the cleaving energy within the society
things we can do to increase the binding

9518
03:07:17,710 --> 03:07:17,720
things we can do to increase the binding
 

9519
03:07:17,720 --> 03:07:19,870
things we can do to increase the binding
energy I think naturally we saw that had

9520
03:07:19,870 --> 03:07:19,880
energy I think naturally we saw that had
 

9521
03:07:19,880 --> 03:07:21,550
energy I think naturally we saw that had
certain characteristics up to a certain

9522
03:07:21,550 --> 03:07:21,560
certain characteristics up to a certain
 

9523
03:07:21,560 --> 03:07:23,269
certain characteristics up to a certain
size kind of

9524
03:07:23,269 --> 03:07:23,279
size kind of
 

9525
03:07:23,279 --> 03:07:25,630
size kind of
tribalism that ended with a few things

9526
03:07:25,630 --> 03:07:25,640
tribalism that ended with a few things
 

9527
03:07:25,640 --> 03:07:27,309
tribalism that ended with a few things
it ended with people having migrated

9528
03:07:27,309 --> 03:07:27,319
it ended with people having migrated
 

9529
03:07:27,319 --> 03:07:29,389
it ended with people having migrated
enough that when you started to get

9530
03:07:29,389 --> 03:07:29,399
enough that when you started to get
 

9531
03:07:29,399 --> 03:07:31,830
enough that when you started to get
resource Wars it you couldn't just

9532
03:07:31,830 --> 03:07:31,840
resource Wars it you couldn't just
 

9533
03:07:31,840 --> 03:07:33,790
resource Wars it you couldn't just
migrate away easily and so tribal

9534
03:07:33,790 --> 03:07:33,800
migrate away easily and so tribal
 

9535
03:07:33,800 --> 03:07:35,910
migrate away easily and so tribal
Warfare became more obligate it involved

9536
03:07:35,910 --> 03:07:35,920
Warfare became more obligate it involved
 

9537
03:07:35,920 --> 03:07:38,190
Warfare became more obligate it involved
the plow in the beginning of real

9538
03:07:38,190 --> 03:07:38,200
the plow in the beginning of real
 

9539
03:07:38,200 --> 03:07:39,630
the plow in the beginning of real
economic surplus there were so there

9540
03:07:39,630 --> 03:07:39,640
economic surplus there were so there
 

9541
03:07:39,640 --> 03:07:42,429
economic surplus there were so there
were a few different kind of um forcing

9542
03:07:42,429 --> 03:07:42,439
were a few different kind of um forcing
 

9543
03:07:42,439 --> 03:07:45,469
were a few different kind of um forcing
functions

9544
03:07:45,469 --> 03:07:45,479

 

9545
03:07:45,479 --> 03:07:47,269

but we're talking about what size should

9546
03:07:47,269 --> 03:07:47,279
but we're talking about what size should
 

9547
03:07:47,279 --> 03:07:49,510
but we're talking about what size should
it be right what size should a society

9548
03:07:49,510 --> 03:07:49,520
it be right what size should a society
 

9549
03:07:49,520 --> 03:07:52,750
it be right what size should a society
be and I think the idea like if we think

9550
03:07:52,750 --> 03:07:52,760
be and I think the idea like if we think
 

9551
03:07:52,760 --> 03:07:54,910
be and I think the idea like if we think
about your body for a moment as a

9552
03:07:54,910 --> 03:07:54,920
about your body for a moment as a
 

9553
03:07:54,920 --> 03:07:57,190
about your body for a moment as a
self-organizing complex system that is

9554
03:07:57,190 --> 03:07:57,200
self-organizing complex system that is
 

9555
03:07:57,200 --> 03:07:59,269
self-organizing complex system that is
multiscaled we think about Body Is a

9556
03:07:59,269 --> 03:07:59,279
multiscaled we think about Body Is a
 

9557
03:07:59,279 --> 03:08:03,550
multiscaled we think about Body Is a
Wonderland our Body Is a Wonderland yeah

9558
03:08:03,550 --> 03:08:03,560
Wonderland our Body Is a Wonderland yeah
 

9559
03:08:03,560 --> 03:08:06,630
Wonderland our Body Is a Wonderland yeah
uh you have that's a John Mayor song I

9560
03:08:06,630 --> 03:08:06,640
uh you have that's a John Mayor song I
 

9561
03:08:06,640 --> 03:08:09,349
uh you have that's a John Mayor song I
apologize but yes so uh if you think

9562
03:08:09,349 --> 03:08:09,359
apologize but yes so uh if you think
 

9563
03:08:09,359 --> 03:08:10,990
apologize but yes so uh if you think
about our our body and the billions of

9564
03:08:10,990 --> 03:08:11,000
about our our body and the billions of
 

9565
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:13,670
about our our body and the billions of
cells that are in it well you don't have

9566
03:08:13,670 --> 03:08:13,680
cells that are in it well you don't have
 

9567
03:08:13,680 --> 03:08:15,150
cells that are in it well you don't have
like think about how ridiculous it would

9568
03:08:15,150 --> 03:08:15,160
like think about how ridiculous it would
 

9569
03:08:15,160 --> 03:08:17,469
like think about how ridiculous it would
be to try to have all the tens of

9570
03:08:17,469 --> 03:08:17,479
be to try to have all the tens of
 

9571
03:08:17,479 --> 03:08:19,110
be to try to have all the tens of
trillions of cells in it with no

9572
03:08:19,110 --> 03:08:19,120
trillions of cells in it with no
 

9573
03:08:19,120 --> 03:08:21,670
trillions of cells in it with no
internal organization structure right

9574
03:08:21,670 --> 03:08:21,680
internal organization structure right
 

9575
03:08:21,680 --> 03:08:24,469
internal organization structure right
just like a sea of protoplasm it would

9576
03:08:24,469 --> 03:08:24,479
just like a sea of protoplasm it would
 

9577
03:08:24,479 --> 03:08:28,150
just like a sea of protoplasm it would
pure democracy and so you have cells and

9578
03:08:28,150 --> 03:08:28,160
pure democracy and so you have cells and
 

9579
03:08:28,160 --> 03:08:30,710
pure democracy and so you have cells and
tissues and then you have tissues and

9580
03:08:30,710 --> 03:08:30,720
tissues and then you have tissues and
 

9581
03:08:30,720 --> 03:08:32,670
tissues and then you have tissues and
organs and organs and organ systems and

9582
03:08:32,670 --> 03:08:32,680
organs and organs and organ systems and
 

9583
03:08:32,680 --> 03:08:34,469
organs and organs and organ systems and
so you have these layers of organization

9584
03:08:34,469 --> 03:08:34,479
so you have these layers of organization
 

9585
03:08:34,479 --> 03:08:36,590
so you have these layers of organization
and then obviously the individual in a

9586
03:08:36,590 --> 03:08:36,600
and then obviously the individual in a
 

9587
03:08:36,600 --> 03:08:38,349
and then obviously the individual in a
tribe in a

9588
03:08:38,349 --> 03:08:38,359
tribe in a
 

9589
03:08:38,359 --> 03:08:41,830
tribe in a
ecosystem and each of the higher layers

9590
03:08:41,830 --> 03:08:41,840
ecosystem and each of the higher layers
 

9591
03:08:41,840 --> 03:08:43,510
ecosystem and each of the higher layers
are both based on the lower layers but

9592
03:08:43,510 --> 03:08:43,520
are both based on the lower layers but
 

9593
03:08:43,520 --> 03:08:45,630
are both based on the lower layers but
also influencing them yeah I think the

9594
03:08:45,630 --> 03:08:45,640
also influencing them yeah I think the
 

9595
03:08:45,640 --> 03:08:48,269
also influencing them yeah I think the
future of civilization will be similar

9596
03:08:48,269 --> 03:08:48,279
future of civilization will be similar
 

9597
03:08:48,279 --> 03:08:49,790
future of civilization will be similar
which is there's a level of governance

9598
03:08:49,790 --> 03:08:49,800
which is there's a level of governance
 

9599
03:08:49,800 --> 03:08:50,710
which is there's a level of governance
that happens at the level of the

9600
03:08:50,710 --> 03:08:50,720
that happens at the level of the
 

9601
03:08:50,720 --> 03:08:53,510
that happens at the level of the
individual my own governance of my own

9602
03:08:53,510 --> 03:08:53,520
individual my own governance of my own
 

9603
03:08:53,520 --> 03:08:55,429
individual my own governance of my own
choice I think there's a level that

9604
03:08:55,429 --> 03:08:55,439
choice I think there's a level that
 

9605
03:08:55,439 --> 03:08:57,830
choice I think there's a level that
happens at the level of a family we're

9606
03:08:57,830 --> 03:08:57,840
happens at the level of a family we're
 

9607
03:08:57,840 --> 03:08:59,469
happens at the level of a family we're
making decisions together we're inter

9608
03:08:59,469 --> 03:08:59,479
making decisions together we're inter
 

9609
03:08:59,479 --> 03:09:00,830
making decisions together we're inter
influencing each other and affecting

9610
03:09:00,830 --> 03:09:00,840
influencing each other and affecting
 

9611
03:09:00,840 --> 03:09:03,750
influencing each other and affecting
each other taking responsibility for the

9612
03:09:03,750 --> 03:09:03,760
each other taking responsibility for the
 

9613
03:09:03,760 --> 03:09:05,309
each other taking responsibility for the
idea of an extended family and you can

9614
03:09:05,309 --> 03:09:05,319
idea of an extended family and you can
 

9615
03:09:05,319 --> 03:09:06,790
idea of an extended family and you can
see that like for a lot of human history

9616
03:09:06,790 --> 03:09:06,800
see that like for a lot of human history
 

9617
03:09:06,800 --> 03:09:08,590
see that like for a lot of human history
we had an extended family we had a local

9618
03:09:08,590 --> 03:09:08,600
we had an extended family we had a local
 

9619
03:09:08,600 --> 03:09:10,349
we had an extended family we had a local
community a local church or whatever it

9620
03:09:10,349 --> 03:09:10,359
community a local church or whatever it
 

9621
03:09:10,359 --> 03:09:12,070
community a local church or whatever it
was we have these intermediate

9622
03:09:12,070 --> 03:09:12,080
was we have these intermediate
 

9623
03:09:12,080 --> 03:09:14,349
was we have these intermediate
structures whereas right now there's

9624
03:09:14,349 --> 03:09:14,359
structures whereas right now there's
 

9625
03:09:14,359 --> 03:09:16,190
structures whereas right now there's
kind of like the

9626
03:09:16,190 --> 03:09:16,200
kind of like the
 

9627
03:09:16,200 --> 03:09:18,750
kind of like the
individual producer consumer taxpayer

9628
03:09:18,750 --> 03:09:18,760
individual producer consumer taxpayer
 

9629
03:09:18,760 --> 03:09:21,269
individual producer consumer taxpayer
voter and the massive nation state

9630
03:09:21,269 --> 03:09:21,279
voter and the massive nation state
 

9631
03:09:21,279 --> 03:09:23,590
voter and the massive nation state
Global complex and not that much in the

9632
03:09:23,590 --> 03:09:23,600
Global complex and not that much in the
 

9633
03:09:23,600 --> 03:09:25,150
Global complex and not that much in the
way of intermediate structures that we

9634
03:09:25,150 --> 03:09:25,160
way of intermediate structures that we
 

9635
03:09:25,160 --> 03:09:26,550
way of intermediate structures that we
relate with and not that much in the way

9636
03:09:26,550 --> 03:09:26,560
relate with and not that much in the way
 

9637
03:09:26,560 --> 03:09:28,229
relate with and not that much in the way
of real personal Dynamics all

9638
03:09:28,229 --> 03:09:28,239
of real personal Dynamics all
 

9639
03:09:28,239 --> 03:09:30,110
of real personal Dynamics all
impersonalized made

9640
03:09:30,110 --> 03:09:30,120
impersonalized made
 

9641
03:09:30,120 --> 03:09:34,790
impersonalized made
fungible and so I think that we have to

9642
03:09:34,790 --> 03:09:34,800
fungible and so I think that we have to
 

9643
03:09:34,800 --> 03:09:38,389
fungible and so I think that we have to
have Global governance meaning I think

9644
03:09:38,389 --> 03:09:38,399
have Global governance meaning I think
 

9645
03:09:38,399 --> 03:09:39,990
have Global governance meaning I think
we have to have governance at the scale

9646
03:09:39,990 --> 03:09:40,000
we have to have governance at the scale
 

9647
03:09:40,000 --> 03:09:42,070
we have to have governance at the scale
we affect stuff and if if anybody is

9648
03:09:42,070 --> 03:09:42,080
we affect stuff and if if anybody is
 

9649
03:09:42,080 --> 03:09:43,590
we affect stuff and if if anybody is
messing up the ocean that matters for

9650
03:09:43,590 --> 03:09:43,600
messing up the ocean that matters for
 

9651
03:09:43,600 --> 03:09:45,710
messing up the ocean that matters for
everybody so that that can't only be

9652
03:09:45,710 --> 03:09:45,720
everybody so that that can't only be
 

9653
03:09:45,720 --> 03:09:48,349
everybody so that that can't only be
National or only local everyone is

9654
03:09:48,349 --> 03:09:48,359
National or only local everyone is
 

9655
03:09:48,359 --> 03:09:49,830
National or only local everyone is
scared of the idea of global governance

9656
03:09:49,830 --> 03:09:49,840
scared of the idea of global governance
 

9657
03:09:49,840 --> 03:09:51,469
scared of the idea of global governance
because we think about some top- down

9658
03:09:51,469 --> 03:09:51,479
because we think about some top- down
 

9659
03:09:51,479 --> 03:09:53,469
because we think about some top- down
system of imposition that now has no

9660
03:09:53,469 --> 03:09:53,479
system of imposition that now has no
 

9661
03:09:53,479 --> 03:09:55,349
system of imposition that now has no
checks and balances on power I'm scared

9662
03:09:55,349 --> 03:09:55,359
checks and balances on power I'm scared
 

9663
03:09:55,359 --> 03:09:56,790
checks and balances on power I'm scared
of that same version so I'm not talking

9664
03:09:56,790 --> 03:09:56,800
of that same version so I'm not talking
 

9665
03:09:56,800 --> 03:09:58,710
of that same version so I'm not talking
about that kind of global

9666
03:09:58,710 --> 03:09:58,720
about that kind of global
 

9667
03:09:58,720 --> 03:10:00,790
about that kind of global
governance um it's why I'm even using

9668
03:10:00,790 --> 03:10:00,800
governance um it's why I'm even using
 

9669
03:10:00,800 --> 03:10:02,670
governance um it's why I'm even using
the word governance as a process rather

9670
03:10:02,670 --> 03:10:02,680
the word governance as a process rather
 

9671
03:10:02,680 --> 03:10:04,269
the word governance as a process rather
than government as an

9672
03:10:04,269 --> 03:10:04,279
than government as an
 

9673
03:10:04,279 --> 03:10:06,229
than government as an
imposed uh

9674
03:10:06,229 --> 03:10:06,239
imposed uh
 

9675
03:10:06,239 --> 03:10:08,469
imposed uh
phenomena and so I think we have to have

9676
03:10:08,469 --> 03:10:08,479
phenomena and so I think we have to have
 

9677
03:10:08,479 --> 03:10:10,070
phenomena and so I think we have to have
Global governance but I think we also

9678
03:10:10,070 --> 03:10:10,080
Global governance but I think we also
 

9679
03:10:10,080 --> 03:10:11,630
Global governance but I think we also
have to have local governance and there

9680
03:10:11,630 --> 03:10:11,640
have to have local governance and there
 

9681
03:10:11,640 --> 03:10:13,229
have to have local governance and there
has to be relationships between them

9682
03:10:13,229 --> 03:10:13,239
has to be relationships between them
 

9683
03:10:13,239 --> 03:10:14,349
has to be relationships between them
that

9684
03:10:14,349 --> 03:10:14,359
that
 

9685
03:10:14,359 --> 03:10:16,429
that
each where there are both checks and

9686
03:10:16,429 --> 03:10:16,439
each where there are both checks and
 

9687
03:10:16,439 --> 03:10:18,910
each where there are both checks and
balances and power flows of information

9688
03:10:18,910 --> 03:10:18,920
balances and power flows of information
 

9689
03:10:18,920 --> 03:10:20,990
balances and power flows of information
so I think governance at the level of

9690
03:10:20,990 --> 03:10:21,000
so I think governance at the level of
 

9691
03:10:21,000 --> 03:10:23,550
so I think governance at the level of
cities will be a bigger deal in the

9692
03:10:23,550 --> 03:10:23,560
cities will be a bigger deal in the
 

9693
03:10:23,560 --> 03:10:25,429
cities will be a bigger deal in the
future than governance at the level of

9694
03:10:25,429 --> 03:10:25,439
future than governance at the level of
 

9695
03:10:25,439 --> 03:10:27,309
future than governance at the level of
nation states because I think nation

9696
03:10:27,309 --> 03:10:27,319
nation states because I think nation
 

9697
03:10:27,319 --> 03:10:30,269
nation states because I think nation
states are largely fictitious things

9698
03:10:30,269 --> 03:10:30,279
states are largely fictitious things
 

9699
03:10:30,279 --> 03:10:32,870
states are largely fictitious things
that are defined by Wars and agreements

9700
03:10:32,870 --> 03:10:32,880
that are defined by Wars and agreements
 

9701
03:10:32,880 --> 03:10:34,590
that are defined by Wars and agreements
to stop Wars and like that I think

9702
03:10:34,590 --> 03:10:34,600
to stop Wars and like that I think
 

9703
03:10:34,600 --> 03:10:36,590
to stop Wars and like that I think
cities are based on real things that

9704
03:10:36,590 --> 03:10:36,600
cities are based on real things that
 

9705
03:10:36,600 --> 03:10:38,269
cities are based on real things that
will keep being real where the proximity

9706
03:10:38,269 --> 03:10:38,279
will keep being real where the proximity
 

9707
03:10:38,279 --> 03:10:40,950
will keep being real where the proximity
of certain things together the physical

9708
03:10:40,950 --> 03:10:40,960
of certain things together the physical
 

9709
03:10:40,960 --> 03:10:42,269
of certain things together the physical
proximity of things together gives

9710
03:10:42,269 --> 03:10:42,279
proximity of things together gives
 

9711
03:10:42,279 --> 03:10:44,750
proximity of things together gives
increased value of those things so you

9712
03:10:44,750 --> 03:10:44,760
increased value of those things so you
 

9713
03:10:44,760 --> 03:10:46,670
increased value of those things so you
look at like Jeffrey West's work on

9714
03:10:46,670 --> 03:10:46,680
look at like Jeffrey West's work on
 

9715
03:10:46,680 --> 03:10:49,630
look at like Jeffrey West's work on
scale and finding that companies and

9716
03:10:49,630 --> 03:10:49,640
scale and finding that companies and
 

9717
03:10:49,640 --> 03:10:51,550
scale and finding that companies and
nation states and things that have a a

9718
03:10:51,550 --> 03:10:51,560
nation states and things that have a a
 

9719
03:10:51,560 --> 03:10:53,229
nation states and things that have a a
kind of complicated agreement structure

9720
03:10:53,229 --> 03:10:53,239
kind of complicated agreement structure
 

9721
03:10:53,239 --> 03:10:55,710
kind of complicated agreement structure
get diminishing return of you of

9722
03:10:55,710 --> 03:10:55,720
get diminishing return of you of
 

9723
03:10:55,720 --> 03:10:57,229
get diminishing return of you of
production per capita as the total

9724
03:10:57,229 --> 03:10:57,239
production per capita as the total
 

9725
03:10:57,239 --> 03:10:58,830
production per capita as the total
number of people increases Beyond about

9726
03:10:58,830 --> 03:10:58,840
number of people increases Beyond about
 

9727
03:10:58,840 --> 03:11:00,229
number of people increases Beyond about
the tribal scale but the city actually

9728
03:11:00,229 --> 03:11:00,239
the tribal scale but the city actually
 

9729
03:11:00,239 --> 03:11:02,790
the tribal scale but the city actually
gets increasing productivity per capita

9730
03:11:02,790 --> 03:11:02,800
gets increasing productivity per capita
 

9731
03:11:02,800 --> 03:11:04,510
gets increasing productivity per capita
but it's not designed it's kind of this

9732
03:11:04,510 --> 03:11:04,520
but it's not designed it's kind of this
 

9733
03:11:04,520 --> 03:11:07,190
but it's not designed it's kind of this
organic thing right so there should be

9734
03:11:07,190 --> 03:11:07,200
organic thing right so there should be
 

9735
03:11:07,200 --> 03:11:08,469
organic thing right so there should be
governance at the level of cities

9736
03:11:08,469 --> 03:11:08,479
governance at the level of cities
 

9737
03:11:08,479 --> 03:11:10,269
governance at the level of cities
because people can sense and actually

9738
03:11:10,269 --> 03:11:10,279
because people can sense and actually
 

9739
03:11:10,279 --> 03:11:12,309
because people can sense and actually
have some agency there probably

9740
03:11:12,309 --> 03:11:12,319
have some agency there probably
 

9741
03:11:12,319 --> 03:11:13,910
have some agency there probably
neighborhood and smaller scales within

9742
03:11:13,910 --> 03:11:13,920
neighborhood and smaller scales within
 

9743
03:11:13,920 --> 03:11:15,550
neighborhood and smaller scales within
it and also verticals and some of it

9744
03:11:15,550 --> 03:11:15,560
it and also verticals and some of it
 

9745
03:11:15,560 --> 03:11:17,030
it and also verticals and some of it
won't be Geographic it'll be network

9746
03:11:17,030 --> 03:11:17,040
won't be Geographic it'll be network
 

9747
03:11:17,040 --> 03:11:19,070
won't be Geographic it'll be network
based right networks of affinities so I

9748
03:11:19,070 --> 03:11:19,080
based right networks of affinities so I
 

9749
03:11:19,080 --> 03:11:21,190
based right networks of affinities so I
don't think the future is one type of

9750
03:11:21,190 --> 03:11:21,200
don't think the future is one type of
 

9751
03:11:21,200 --> 03:11:23,790
don't think the future is one type of
governance now what we can say more

9752
03:11:23,790 --> 03:11:23,800
governance now what we can say more
 

9753
03:11:23,800 --> 03:11:25,870
governance now what we can say more
broadly is say when we're talking about

9754
03:11:25,870 --> 03:11:25,880
broadly is say when we're talking about
 

9755
03:11:25,880 --> 03:11:27,269
broadly is say when we're talking about
groups of people that inter affect each

9756
03:11:27,269 --> 03:11:27,279
groups of people that inter affect each
 

9757
03:11:27,279 --> 03:11:29,550
groups of people that inter affect each
other the idea of a civilization is that

03:11:29,550 --> 03:11:29,560
other the idea of a civilization is that

choic making to not be at war with each

03:11:34,080 --> 03:11:36,190
choic making to not be at war with each
other and hopefully increase

9764
03:11:36,190 --> 03:11:36,200
other and hopefully increase
 

9765
03:11:36,200 --> 03:11:38,309
other and hopefully increase
total productive capacity in way that's

9766
03:11:38,309 --> 03:11:38,319
total productive capacity in way that's
 

9767
03:11:38,319 --> 03:11:40,469
total productive capacity in way that's
good for everybody division of labor and

9768
03:11:40,469 --> 03:11:40,479
good for everybody division of labor and
 

9769
03:11:40,479 --> 03:11:43,150
good for everybody division of labor and
Specialty so we all get more better

9770
03:11:43,150 --> 03:11:43,160
Specialty so we all get more better
 

9771
03:11:43,160 --> 03:11:45,910
Specialty so we all get more better
stuff and whatever but it's a it's a

9772
03:11:45,910 --> 03:11:45,920
stuff and whatever but it's a it's a
 

9773
03:11:45,920 --> 03:11:48,790
stuff and whatever but it's a it's a
coordination of our choice

9774
03:11:48,790 --> 03:11:48,800
coordination of our choice
 

9775
03:11:48,800 --> 03:11:50,710
coordination of our choice
making I think we can look at

9776
03:11:50,710 --> 03:11:50,720
making I think we can look at
 

9777
03:11:50,720 --> 03:11:54,150
making I think we can look at
civilizations failing on the side of not

9778
03:11:54,150 --> 03:11:54,160
civilizations failing on the side of not
 

9779
03:11:54,160 --> 03:11:55,590
civilizations failing on the side of not
having enough coordination of choic

9780
03:11:55,590 --> 03:11:55,600
having enough coordination of choic
 

9781
03:11:55,600 --> 03:11:57,309
having enough coordination of choic
making so they fail on the side of chaos

9782
03:11:57,309 --> 03:11:57,319
making so they fail on the side of chaos
 

9783
03:11:57,319 --> 03:11:58,950
making so they fail on the side of chaos
and then they cleave and an internal War

9784
03:11:58,950 --> 03:11:58,960
and then they cleave and an internal War
 

9785
03:11:58,960 --> 03:12:02,349
and then they cleave and an internal War
comes about or whatever or they can't uh

9786
03:12:02,349 --> 03:12:02,359
comes about or whatever or they can't uh
 

9787
03:12:02,359 --> 03:12:04,590
comes about or whatever or they can't uh
make smart decisions and they overuse

9788
03:12:04,590 --> 03:12:04,600
make smart decisions and they overuse
 

9789
03:12:04,600 --> 03:12:08,070
make smart decisions and they overuse
their resources or whatever or it can

9790
03:12:08,070 --> 03:12:08,080
their resources or whatever or it can
 

9791
03:12:08,080 --> 03:12:11,030
their resources or whatever or it can
fail on the side of trying to get

9792
03:12:11,030 --> 03:12:11,040
fail on the side of trying to get
 

9793
03:12:11,040 --> 03:12:14,190
fail on the side of trying to get
order via imposition via force and so it

9794
03:12:14,190 --> 03:12:14,200
order via imposition via force and so it
 

9795
03:12:14,200 --> 03:12:15,630
order via imposition via force and so it
fails on the side of Oppression which

9796
03:12:15,630 --> 03:12:15,640
fails on the side of Oppression which
 

9797
03:12:15,640 --> 03:12:19,670
fails on the side of Oppression which
ends up being for a while functional is

9798
03:12:19,670 --> 03:12:19,680
ends up being for a while functional is
 

9799
03:12:19,680 --> 03:12:21,790
ends up being for a while functional is
for the thing as a whole but miserable

9800
03:12:21,790 --> 03:12:21,800
for the thing as a whole but miserable
 

9801
03:12:21,800 --> 03:12:23,990
for the thing as a whole but miserable
for most people in it until it fails

9802
03:12:23,990 --> 03:12:24,000
for most people in it until it fails
 

9803
03:12:24,000 --> 03:12:25,710
for most people in it until it fails
either because of Revolt or because it

9804
03:12:25,710 --> 03:12:25,720
either because of Revolt or because it
 

9805
03:12:25,720 --> 03:12:27,269
either because of Revolt or because it
can't innovate enough or something like

9806
03:12:27,269 --> 03:12:27,279
can't innovate enough or something like
 

9807
03:12:27,279 --> 03:12:30,070
can't innovate enough or something like
that and so there's this like toggling

9808
03:12:30,070 --> 03:12:30,080
that and so there's this like toggling
 

9809
03:12:30,080 --> 03:12:34,150
that and so there's this like toggling
between order via oppression and chaos

9810
03:12:34,150 --> 03:12:34,160
between order via oppression and chaos
 

9811
03:12:34,160 --> 03:12:37,269
between order via oppression and chaos
and I think the idea of democracy not

9812
03:12:37,269 --> 03:12:37,279
and I think the idea of democracy not
 

9813
03:12:37,279 --> 03:12:38,830
and I think the idea of democracy not
the way we've implemented it but the

9814
03:12:38,830 --> 03:12:38,840
the way we've implemented it but the
 

9815
03:12:38,840 --> 03:12:40,830
the way we've implemented it but the
idea of it whether we're talking about a

9816
03:12:40,830 --> 03:12:40,840
idea of it whether we're talking about a
 

9817
03:12:40,840 --> 03:12:42,670
idea of it whether we're talking about a
representative democracy or a direct

9818
03:12:42,670 --> 03:12:42,680
representative democracy or a direct
 

9819
03:12:42,680 --> 03:12:45,510
representative democracy or a direct
digital democracy liquid democracy uh

9820
03:12:45,510 --> 03:12:45,520

we have order that is emergent rather

9826
03:12:53,469 --> 03:12:53,479
we have order that is emergent rather
 

9827
03:12:53,479 --> 03:12:56,110
we have order that is emergent rather
than imposed so that we aren't stuck

9828
03:12:56,110 --> 03:12:56,120
than imposed so that we aren't stuck
 

9829
03:12:56,120 --> 03:12:59,309
than imposed so that we aren't stuck
with chaos and infighting and inability

9830
03:12:59,309 --> 03:12:59,319
with chaos and infighting and inability
 

9831
03:12:59,319 --> 03:13:01,670
with chaos and infighting and inability
to coordinate and we're also not stuck

9832
03:13:01,670 --> 03:13:01,680
to coordinate and we're also not stuck
 

9833
03:13:01,680 --> 03:13:02,590
to coordinate and we're also not stuck
with

with
 

9835
03:13:02,600 --> 03:13:04,229
with
oppression

9836
03:13:04,229 --> 03:13:04,239
oppression
 

9837
03:13:04,239 --> 03:13:07,429
oppression
and what would it take to have emergent

9838
03:13:07,429 --> 03:13:07,439
and what would it take to have emergent
 

9839
03:13:07,439 --> 03:13:10,070
and what would it take to have emergent
order this is the most kind of central

9840
03:13:10,070 --> 03:13:10,080
order this is the most kind of central
 

9841
03:13:10,080 --> 03:13:14,750
order this is the most kind of central
question for me these days because

9842
03:13:14,750 --> 03:13:14,760

 

9843
03:13:14,760 --> 03:13:16,990

if we look at what different nation

9844
03:13:16,990 --> 03:13:17,000
if we look at what different nation
 

9845
03:13:17,000 --> 03:13:18,510
if we look at what different nation
states are doing around the world and we

9846
03:13:18,510 --> 03:13:18,520
states are doing around the world and we
 

9847
03:13:18,520 --> 03:13:21,990
states are doing around the world and we
see nation states that are more

9848
03:13:21,990 --> 03:13:22,000
see nation states that are more
 

9849
03:13:22,000 --> 03:13:23,870
see nation states that are more
authoritarian that in some ways are

9850
03:13:23,870 --> 03:13:23,880
authoritarian that in some ways are
 

9851
03:13:23,880 --> 03:13:25,429
authoritarian that in some ways are
actually coordinating much more

9852
03:13:25,429 --> 03:13:25,439
actually coordinating much more
 

9853
03:13:25,439 --> 03:13:29,469
actually coordinating much more
effectively so for instance we can see

9854
03:13:29,469 --> 03:13:29,479
effectively so for instance we can see
 

9855
03:13:29,479 --> 03:13:32,190
effectively so for instance we can see
that China has built High-Speed Rail not

9856
03:13:32,190 --> 03:13:32,200
that China has built High-Speed Rail not
 

9857
03:13:32,200 --> 03:13:33,750
that China has built High-Speed Rail not
just through its country but around the

9858
03:13:33,750 --> 03:13:33,760
just through its country but around the
 

9859
03:13:33,760 --> 03:13:35,190
just through its country but around the
world and the US hasn't built any

9860
03:13:35,190 --> 03:13:35,200
world and the US hasn't built any
 

9861
03:13:35,200 --> 03:13:37,469
world and the US hasn't built any
High-Speed Rail yet you can see that it

9862
03:13:37,469 --> 03:13:37,479
High-Speed Rail yet you can see that it
 

9863
03:13:37,479 --> 03:13:38,950
High-Speed Rail yet you can see that it
brought 300 million people out of

9864
03:13:38,950 --> 03:13:38,960
brought 300 million people out of
 

9865
03:13:38,960 --> 03:13:40,910
brought 300 million people out of
poverty in a time where we've had

9866
03:13:40,910 --> 03:13:40,920
poverty in a time where we've had
 

9867
03:13:40,920 --> 03:13:43,790
poverty in a time where we've had
increasing economic inequality happening

9868
03:13:43,790 --> 03:13:43,800
increasing economic inequality happening
 

9869
03:13:43,800 --> 03:13:47,389
increasing economic inequality happening
you can see like that if there was a

9870
03:13:47,389 --> 03:13:47,399
you can see like that if there was a
 

9871
03:13:47,399 --> 03:13:48,630
you can see like that if there was a
single country that could make all of

9872
03:13:48,630 --> 03:13:48,640
single country that could make all of
 

9873
03:13:48,640 --> 03:13:50,030
single country that could make all of
its own stuff if the global Supply

9874
03:13:50,030 --> 03:13:50,040
its own stuff if the global Supply
 

9875
03:13:50,040 --> 03:13:52,349
its own stuff if the global Supply
chains failed China would be the closest

9876
03:13:52,349 --> 03:13:52,359

9877
03:13:52,359 --> 03:13:54,510

one to being able to start to go closed

03:13:54,510 --> 03:13:54,520

9907
03:14:29,880 --> 03:14:31,429
monarchs that's the thing we were trying
to get away from and that there would be

9908

to get away from and that there would be
 

9909

kind of thing but that also has created

so I don't think to try to trace complex

10212
03:20:23,910 --> 03:20:23,920
so I don't think to try to trace complex
 

10213
03:20:23,920 --> 03:20:25,830
so I don't think to try to trace complex
things to one cause is a good idea so I

10214
03:20:25,830 --> 03:20:25,840
things to one cause is a good idea so I
 

10215
03:20:25,840 --> 03:20:27,389
things to one cause is a good idea so I
think this is a reductionist view but it

10216
03:20:27,389 --> 03:20:27,399
think this is a reductionist view but it
 

10217
03:20:27,399 --> 03:20:30,150
think this is a reductionist view but it
has truth in it

has truth in it
 

10219
03:20:30,160 --> 03:20:32,670
has truth in it
and so the idea that technology is

03:20:32,670 --> 03:20:32,680
and so the idea that technology is
 

10221
03:20:32,680 --> 03:20:35,030
and so the idea that technology is
values agnostic is silly technology

10222

10234
03:20:46,550 --> 03:20:46,560
changing the environment radically to to
 

10235
03:20:46,560 --> 03:20:48,590
changing the environment radically to to
clear-cut areas to just make them useful

10236
03:20:48,590 --> 03:20:48,600
clear-cut areas to just make them useful
 

10237
03:20:48,600 --> 03:20:50,150
clear-cut areas to just make them useful
for people which also meant the change

10238
03:20:50,150 --> 03:20:50,160
for people which also meant the change
 

10239
03:20:50,160 --> 03:20:52,429
for people which also meant the change
of the view of where the the web of life

10240
03:20:52,429 --> 03:20:52,439
of the view of where the the web of life
 

10241
03:20:52,439 --> 03:20:54,870
of the view of where the the web of life
we just a part of it Etc so all those

10242
03:20:54,870 --> 03:20:54,880
we just a part of it Etc so all those
 

10243
03:20:54,880 --> 03:20:58,030
we just a part of it Etc so all those
types of things um so that's brilliantly

10244
03:20:58,030 --> 03:20:58,040
types of things um so that's brilliantly
 

10245
03:20:58,040 --> 03:21:01,229
types of things um so that's brilliantly
put but by the way that was just

10246
03:21:01,229 --> 03:21:01,239
put but by the way that was just
 

10247
03:21:01,239 --> 03:21:04,229
put but by the way that was just
brilliant but the question is so it's

10248
03:21:04,229 --> 03:21:04,239
brilliant but the question is so it's
 

10249
03:21:04,239 --> 03:21:07,070
brilliant but the question is so it's
not agnostic but so we have to look at

10250
03:21:07,070 --> 03:21:07,080
not agnostic but so we have to look at
 

10251
03:21:07,080 --> 03:21:08,790
not agnostic but so we have to look at
what the psychological effects of

10252
03:21:08,790 --> 03:21:08,800
what the psychological effects of
 

10253
03:21:08,800 --> 03:21:11,590
what the psychological effects of
specific Tech applied certain ways are

10254
03:21:11,590 --> 03:21:11,600
specific Tech applied certain ways are
 

10255
03:21:11,600 --> 03:21:14,590
specific Tech applied certain ways are
and be able to say it's not just doing

10256
03:21:14,590 --> 03:21:14,600
and be able to say it's not just doing
 

10257
03:21:14,600 --> 03:21:16,590
and be able to say it's not just doing
the first order thing you intended it's

10258
03:21:16,590 --> 03:21:16,600
the first order thing you intended it's
 

10259
03:21:16,600 --> 03:21:19,670
the first order thing you intended it's
doing like the effect on patriarchy and

10260
03:21:19,670 --> 03:21:19,680
doing like the effect on patriarchy and
 

10261
03:21:19,680 --> 03:21:22,670
doing like the effect on patriarchy and
animism and um the end of tribal culture

10262
03:21:22,670 --> 03:21:22,680
animism and um the end of tribal culture
 

10263
03:21:22,680 --> 03:21:24,030
animism and um the end of tribal culture
and the beginning of Empire and the

10264
03:21:24,030 --> 03:21:24,040
and the beginning of Empire and the
 

10265
03:21:24,040 --> 03:21:25,950
and the beginning of Empire and the
class systems that came with that and we

10266
03:21:25,950 --> 03:21:25,960
class systems that came with that and we
 

10267
03:21:25,960 --> 03:21:28,150
class systems that came with that and we
can go on and on about what the plow did

10268
03:21:28,150 --> 03:21:28,160
can go on and on about what the plow did
 

10269
03:21:28,160 --> 03:21:29,950
can go on and on about what the plow did
um the beginning of surplus was

10270
03:21:29,950 --> 03:21:29,960
um the beginning of surplus was
 

10271
03:21:29,960 --> 03:21:31,429
um the beginning of surplus was
inheritance which then became the

10272
03:21:31,429 --> 03:21:31,439
inheritance which then became the
 

10273
03:21:31,439 --> 03:21:33,429
inheritance which then became the
capital model and like lots of

10274
03:21:33,429 --> 03:21:33,439
capital model and like lots of
 

10275
03:21:33,439 --> 03:21:35,710
capital model and like lots of
things so we have to say when we're

10276
03:21:35,710 --> 03:21:35,720
things so we have to say when we're
 

10277
03:21:35,720 --> 03:21:38,429
things so we have to say when we're
looking at the tech how is what are the

10278
03:21:38,429 --> 03:21:38,439
looking at the tech how is what are the
 

10279
03:21:38,439 --> 03:21:40,389
looking at the tech how is what are the
values built into the way the tech is

10280
03:21:40,389 --> 03:21:40,399
values built into the way the tech is
 

10281
03:21:40,399 --> 03:21:42,750
values built into the way the tech is
being built that are not obvious

10282
03:21:42,750 --> 03:21:42,760
being built that are not obvious
 

10283
03:21:42,760 --> 03:21:44,070
being built that are not obvious
right so you always have to consider

10284
03:21:44,070 --> 03:21:44,080
right so you always have to consider
 

10285
03:21:44,080 --> 03:21:45,790
right so you always have to consider
externalities this is no matter what and

10286
03:21:45,790 --> 03:21:45,800
externalities this is no matter what and
 

10287
03:21:45,800 --> 03:21:47,030
externalities this is no matter what and
the externalities are not just physical

10288
03:21:47,030 --> 03:21:47,040
the externalities are not just physical
 

10289
03:21:47,040 --> 03:21:48,429
the externalities are not just physical
to the environment they're also to how

10290
03:21:48,429 --> 03:21:48,439
to the environment they're also to how
 

10291
03:21:48,439 --> 03:21:49,950
to the environment they're also to how
the people are being conditioned and how

10292
03:21:49,950 --> 03:21:49,960
the people are being conditioned and how
 

10293
03:21:49,960 --> 03:21:51,630
the people are being conditioned and how
the relationality between them is being

10294
03:21:51,630 --> 03:21:51,640
the relationality between them is being
 

10295
03:21:51,640 --> 03:21:53,269
the relationality between them is being
condition the question I'm asking you so

10296
03:21:53,269 --> 03:21:53,279
condition the question I'm asking you so
 

10297
03:21:53,279 --> 03:21:55,750
condition the question I'm asking you so
I personally would rather be led by a

10298
03:21:55,750 --> 03:21:55,760
I personally would rather be led by a
 

10299
03:21:55,760 --> 03:21:58,670
I personally would rather be led by a
plow and a tractor than Stalin okay

10300
03:21:58,670 --> 03:21:58,680
plow and a tractor than Stalin okay
 

10301
03:21:58,680 --> 03:22:01,389
plow and a tractor than Stalin okay
that's the question I'm asking you is

10302
03:22:01,389 --> 03:22:01,399
that's the question I'm asking you is
 

10303
03:22:01,399 --> 03:22:05,790
that's the question I'm asking you is
uh in creating an emergent government

10304
03:22:05,790 --> 03:22:05,800
uh in creating an emergent government
 

10305
03:22:05,800 --> 03:22:08,229
uh in creating an emergent government
where people where there's a democracy

10306
03:22:08,229 --> 03:22:08,239
where people where there's a democracy
 

10307
03:22:08,239 --> 03:22:10,550
where people where there's a democracy
that's Dynamic that makes choices that

10308
03:22:10,550 --> 03:22:10,560
that's Dynamic that makes choices that
 

10309
03:22:10,560 --> 03:22:12,389
that's Dynamic that makes choices that
does governance

10310
03:22:12,389 --> 03:22:12,399
does governance
 

10311
03:22:12,399 --> 03:22:18,550
does governance
at at like a very kind of liquid like uh

10312
03:22:18,550 --> 03:22:18,560
at at like a very kind of liquid like uh
 

10313
03:22:18,560 --> 03:22:21,110
at at like a very kind of liquid like uh
there's a bunch of fine resolution

10314
03:22:21,110 --> 03:22:21,120
there's a bunch of fine resolution
 

10315
03:22:21,120 --> 03:22:23,750
there's a bunch of fine resolution
layers of abstraction of governance

10316
03:22:23,750 --> 03:22:23,760
layers of abstraction of governance
 

10317
03:22:23,760 --> 03:22:26,710
layers of abstraction of governance
happening at all scales right and doing

10318
03:22:26,710 --> 03:22:26,720
happening at all scales right and doing
 

10319
03:22:26,720 --> 03:22:29,630
happening at all scales right and doing
so dynamically where no one person has

10320
03:22:29,630 --> 03:22:29,640
so dynamically where no one person has
 

10321
03:22:29,640 --> 03:22:32,030
so dynamically where no one person has
power at any one time that can Dominate

10322
03:22:32,030 --> 03:22:32,040
power at any one time that can Dominate
 

10323
03:22:32,040 --> 03:22:34,950
power at any one time that can Dominate
and impose rule okay that's the Stalin

10324
03:22:34,950 --> 03:22:34,960
and impose rule okay that's the Stalin
 

10325
03:22:34,960 --> 03:22:37,070
and impose rule okay that's the Stalin
version I'm saying

10326
03:22:37,070 --> 03:22:37,080
version I'm saying
 

10327
03:22:37,080 --> 03:22:40,349
version I'm saying
isn't the the uh alter isn't the

10328
03:22:40,349 --> 03:22:40,359
isn't the the uh alter isn't the
 

10329
03:22:40,359 --> 03:22:44,189
isn't the the uh alter isn't the
alternative that's emergent empowered or

10330
03:22:44,189 --> 03:22:44,199
alternative that's emergent empowered or
 

10331
03:22:44,199 --> 03:22:48,269
alternative that's emergent empowered or
made possible by the plow and the

10332
03:22:48,269 --> 03:22:48,279
made possible by the plow and the
 

10333
03:22:48,279 --> 03:22:50,590
made possible by the plow and the
tractor which is the modern version of

10334
03:22:50,590 --> 03:22:50,600
tractor which is the modern version of
 

10335
03:22:50,600 --> 03:22:53,309
tractor which is the modern version of
that is like the internet the the

03:22:53,309 --> 03:22:53,319
that is like the internet the the
 

10337
03:22:53,319 --> 03:22:56,070
that is like the internet the the
digital space where we can the monetary

10338
03:22:56,070 --> 03:22:56,080
digital space where we can the monetary
 

10339
03:22:56,080 --> 03:22:57,910
digital space where we can the monetary
system where you have the cryptocurrency

10340
03:22:57,910 --> 03:22:57,920
system where you have the cryptocurrency
 

10341
03:22:57,920 --> 03:23:00,550
system where you have the cryptocurrency
and so on but you have much more

10342
03:23:00,550 --> 03:23:00,560
and so on but you have much more

had a brilliant rant there the tractor

10354
03:23:14,830 --> 03:23:14,840
had a brilliant rant there the tractor
 

10355
03:23:14,840 --> 03:23:17,189
had a brilliant rant there the tractor
has effects but isn't that the way we

has effects but isn't that the way we
 

10357

so you couldn't have had a Stalin

10378
03:23:44,030 --> 03:23:44,040
so you couldn't have had a Stalin
 

10379
03:23:44,040 --> 03:23:45,830
so you couldn't have had a Stalin
without having certain Technologies

10380

without having certain Technologies
 

10381

emerge he couldn't have ruled such a big

emerge he couldn't have ruled such a big
 

10383
03:23:47,560 --> 03:23:49,389
emerge he couldn't have ruled such a big
area without transportation Technologies

area without transportation Technologies
 

10385

03:23:55,110 --> 03:23:55,120
communication Tech that made it possible
 

10389
03:23:55,120 --> 03:23:57,790
communication Tech that made it possible
so when you say you'd rather have a

10390
03:23:57,790 --> 03:23:57,800
so when you say you'd rather have a
 

10391
03:23:57,800 --> 03:23:59,510
so when you say you'd rather have a
tractor or a plow than a Stalin there's

10392
03:23:59,510 --> 03:23:59,520
tractor or a plow than a Stalin there's
 

10393
03:23:59,520 --> 03:24:01,750
tractor or a plow than a Stalin there's
a relationship between them that is more

10394
03:24:01,750 --> 03:24:01,760
a relationship between them that is more
 

10395
03:24:01,760 --> 03:24:03,750
a relationship between them that is more
recursive which

10396
03:24:03,750 --> 03:24:03,760
recursive which
 

10397
03:24:03,760 --> 03:24:08,070
recursive which
is new physical Technologies allow

03:24:08,070 --> 03:24:08,080
is new physical Technologies allow
 

10399
03:24:08,080 --> 03:24:10,189
is new physical Technologies allow

larger distances ially mhm
 

10403
03:24:14,479 --> 03:24:17,389
larger distances ially mhm
and um but some things are more

03:24:17,389 --> 03:24:17,399
and um but some things are more
 

10405
03:24:17,399 --> 03:24:19,590
and um but some things are more
responsible for that than others like

03:24:19,590 --> 03:24:19,600
responsible for that than others like
 

10407
03:24:19,600 --> 03:24:22,269
responsible for that than others like
Stalin also ate stuff for breakfast but

10408
03:24:22,269 --> 03:24:22,279
Stalin also ate stuff for breakfast but
 

10409
03:24:22,279 --> 03:24:23,950
Stalin also ate stuff for breakfast but
the thing he ate for breakfast is less

10410
03:24:23,950 --> 03:24:23,960
the thing he ate for breakfast is less
 

10411
03:24:23,960 --> 03:24:25,870
the thing he ate for breakfast is less
responsible for the starvation of

10412
03:24:25,870 --> 03:24:25,880
responsible for the starvation of
 

10413
03:24:25,880 --> 03:24:28,429
responsible for the starvation of
millions than than the Train the train

10414
03:24:28,429 --> 03:24:28,439
millions than than the Train the train
 

10415
03:24:28,439 --> 03:24:30,389
millions than than the Train the train
is more responsible for that and then

10416
03:24:30,389 --> 03:24:30,399
is more responsible for that and then
 

10417
03:24:30,399 --> 03:24:32,309
is more responsible for that and then
the weapons of war are more responsible

10418
03:24:32,309 --> 03:24:32,319
the weapons of war are more responsible
 

10419
03:24:32,319 --> 03:24:35,150
the weapons of war are more responsible
so some technology like let's not throw

10420
03:24:35,150 --> 03:24:35,160
so some technology like let's not throw
 

10421
03:24:35,160 --> 03:24:37,110
so some technology like let's not throw
it all in the you're saying like

10422
03:24:37,110 --> 03:24:37,120
it all in the you're saying like
 

10423
03:24:37,120 --> 03:24:39,750
it all in the you're saying like
technology has a responsibility here but

10424
03:24:39,750 --> 03:24:39,760
technology has a responsibility here but
 

10425
03:24:39,760 --> 03:24:43,349
technology has a responsibility here but
some is better than other I'm saying

10426
03:24:43,349 --> 03:24:43,359
some is better than other I'm saying
 

10427
03:24:43,359 --> 03:24:45,389
some is better than other I'm saying
people's use of Technology will change

10428
03:24:45,389 --> 03:24:45,399
people's use of Technology will change
 

10429
03:24:45,399 --> 03:24:47,269
people's use of Technology will change
their behavior so it has behavioral

10430
03:24:47,269 --> 03:24:47,279
their behavior so it has behavioral
 

10431
03:24:47,279 --> 03:24:49,429
their behavior so it has behavioral
dispositions built in the change of the

10432
03:24:49,429 --> 03:24:49,439
dispositions built in the change of the
 

10433
03:24:49,439 --> 03:24:51,510
dispositions built in the change of the
behavior will also change the values in

10434
03:24:51,510 --> 03:24:51,520
behavior will also change the values in
 

10435
03:24:51,520 --> 03:24:53,510
behavior will also change the values in
the society it's very complicated right

10436
03:24:53,510 --> 03:24:53,520
the society it's very complicated right
 

10437
03:24:53,520 --> 03:24:56,189
the society it's very complicated right
it will also as a result both make

10438
03:24:56,189 --> 03:24:56,199
it will also as a result both make
 

10439
03:24:56,199 --> 03:24:57,750
it will also as a result both make
people who have different kinds of

10440
03:24:57,750 --> 03:24:57,760
people who have different kinds of
 

10441
03:24:57,760 --> 03:25:00,229
people who have different kinds of
predispositions with regard to rulership

10442
03:25:00,229 --> 03:25:00,239
predispositions with regard to rulership
 

10443
03:25:00,239 --> 03:25:03,229
predispositions with regard to rulership
and different kinds of new capacities

10444
03:25:03,229 --> 03:25:03,239
and different kinds of new capacities
 

10445
03:25:03,239 --> 03:25:05,229
and different kinds of new capacities
and so we have to think about these

10446
03:25:05,229 --> 03:25:05,239
and so we have to think about these
 

10447
03:25:05,239 --> 03:25:08,389
and so we have to think about these
things it's kind of well understood that

10448
03:25:08,389 --> 03:25:08,399
things it's kind of well understood that
 

10449
03:25:08,399 --> 03:25:10,910
things it's kind of well understood that
the printing press and then in early

10450
03:25:10,910 --> 03:25:10,920
the printing press and then in early

Industrial M ended feudalism and created

10452
03:25:13,830 --> 03:25:13,840
Industrial M ended feudalism and created
 

10453
03:25:13,840 --> 03:25:16,630
Industrial M ended feudalism and created
kind of nation states so one thing I

10454
03:25:16,630 --> 03:25:16,640
kind of nation states so one thing I
 

10455
03:25:16,640 --> 03:25:19,630
kind of nation states so one thing I
would say as a long Trend it that we can

10456
03:25:19,630 --> 03:25:19,640
would say as a long Trend it that we can
 

10457
03:25:19,640 --> 03:25:22,110
would say as a long Trend it that we can
look at is that whenever there is a a a

10458
03:25:22,110 --> 03:25:22,120
look at is that whenever there is a a a
 

10459
03:25:22,120 --> 03:25:24,950
look at is that whenever there is a a a
step function a major leap in technology

10460
03:25:24,950 --> 03:25:24,960
step function a major leap in technology
 

10461
03:25:24,960 --> 03:25:27,229
step function a major leap in technology
physical technology the the underlying

10462
03:25:27,229 --> 03:25:27,239
physical technology the the underlying
 

10463
03:25:27,239 --> 03:25:29,150
physical technology the the underlying
techno-industrial base with which we do

10464
03:25:29,150 --> 03:25:29,160
techno-industrial base with which we do
 

10465
03:25:29,160 --> 03:25:32,389
techno-industrial base with which we do
stuff it ends up coding for it ends up

10466
03:25:32,389 --> 03:25:32,399
stuff it ends up coding for it ends up
 

10467
03:25:32,399 --> 03:25:34,349
stuff it ends up coding for it ends up
predisposing a whole bunch of human

10468
03:25:34,349 --> 03:25:34,359
predisposing a whole bunch of human
 

10469
03:25:34,359 --> 03:25:36,710
predisposing a whole bunch of human
behavioral patterns that the previous

10470
03:25:36,710 --> 03:25:36,720
behavioral patterns that the previous
 

10471
03:25:36,720 --> 03:25:38,710
behavioral patterns that the previous
social system what had not emerged to

10472
03:25:38,710 --> 03:25:38,720
social system what had not emerged to
 

10473
03:25:38,720 --> 03:25:41,630
social system what had not emerged to
try to solve and so it usually ends up

10474
03:25:41,630 --> 03:25:41,640
try to solve and so it usually ends up
 

10475
03:25:41,640 --> 03:25:43,550
try to solve and so it usually ends up
breaking the previous social systems the

10476
03:25:43,550 --> 03:25:43,560
breaking the previous social systems the
 

10477
03:25:43,560 --> 03:25:45,349
breaking the previous social systems the
way the plow broke the tribal system the

10478
03:25:45,349 --> 03:25:45,359
way the plow broke the tribal system the
 

10479
03:25:45,359 --> 03:25:46,670
way the plow broke the tribal system the
way that the Industrial Revolution broke

10480
03:25:46,670 --> 03:25:46,680
way that the Industrial Revolution broke
 

10481
03:25:46,680 --> 03:25:48,990
way that the Industrial Revolution broke
the feudal system and then new social

10482
03:25:48,990 --> 03:25:49,000
the feudal system and then new social
 

10483
03:25:49,000 --> 03:25:50,750
the feudal system and then new social
systems have to emerge that can deal

10484
03:25:50,750 --> 03:25:50,760
systems have to emerge that can deal
 

10485
03:25:50,760 --> 03:25:53,229
systems have to emerge that can deal
with that the new powers the new

10486
03:25:53,229 --> 03:25:53,239
with that the new powers the new
 

10487
03:25:53,239 --> 03:25:55,309
with that the new powers the new
dispositions whatever with that Tech

10488
03:25:55,309 --> 03:25:55,319
dispositions whatever with that Tech
 

10489
03:25:55,319 --> 03:25:57,550
dispositions whatever with that Tech
obviously the nuke broke nation state

10490
03:25:57,550 --> 03:25:57,560
obviously the nuke broke nation state
 

10491
03:25:57,560 --> 03:25:59,870
obviously the nuke broke nation state
governance being adequate and said we

10492
03:25:59,870 --> 03:25:59,880
governance being adequate and said we
 

10493
03:25:59,880 --> 03:26:01,110
governance being adequate and said we
can't ever have that again so then it

10494
03:26:01,110 --> 03:26:01,120
can't ever have that again so then it
 

10495
03:26:01,120 --> 03:26:03,990
can't ever have that again so then it
created this in international governance

10496
03:26:03,990 --> 03:26:04,000
created this in international governance
 

10497
03:26:04,000 --> 03:26:05,710
created this in international governance

10498
03:26:05,710 --> 03:26:05,720

03:26:08,269 --> 03:26:08,279
world
 

10501
03:26:08,279 --> 03:26:14,790
world
so I guess what I'm saying is

10502
03:26:14,790 --> 03:26:14,800

 

10503
03:26:14,800 --> 03:26:19,950

that the solution is not exponential

10504
03:26:19,950 --> 03:26:19,960
that the solution is not exponential
 

10505
03:26:19,960 --> 03:26:22,269
that the solution is not exponential
Tech following the current path of what

10506
03:26:22,269 --> 03:26:22,279
Tech following the current path of what
 

10507
03:26:22,279 --> 03:26:24,389
Tech following the current path of what
the market incentivizes exponential Tech

10508
03:26:24,389 --> 03:26:24,399
the market incentivizes exponential Tech
 

10509
03:26:24,399 --> 03:26:27,150
the market incentivizes exponential Tech
to do Market being a previous social

10510
03:26:27,150 --> 03:26:27,160
to do Market being a previous social
 

10511
03:26:27,160 --> 03:26:31,469
to do Market being a previous social
Tech I would say

10512
03:26:31,469 --> 03:26:31,479

 

10513
03:26:31,479 --> 03:26:34,990

that exponential

10514
03:26:34,990 --> 03:26:35,000
that exponential
 

10515
03:26:35,000 --> 03:26:37,510
that exponential
Tech if we look at different types of

10516
03:26:37,510 --> 03:26:37,520
Tech if we look at different types of
 

10517
03:26:37,520 --> 03:26:40,229
Tech if we look at different types of
social Tech so let's just briefly look

10518
03:26:40,229 --> 03:26:40,239
social Tech so let's just briefly look
 

10519
03:26:40,239 --> 03:26:43,229
social Tech so let's just briefly look
at the democracy tried to do the

10520
03:26:43,229 --> 03:26:43,239
at the democracy tried to do the
 

10521
03:26:43,239 --> 03:26:45,309
at the democracy tried to do the
emergent order

10522
03:26:45,309 --> 03:26:45,319
emergent order
 

10523
03:26:45,319 --> 03:26:47,950
emergent order
thing right at least that's the

10524
03:26:47,950 --> 03:26:47,960
thing right at least that's the
 

10525
03:26:47,960 --> 03:26:50,550
thing right at least that's the
story and which

10526
03:26:50,550 --> 03:26:50,560
story and which
 

10527
03:26:50,560 --> 03:26:53,229
story and which
is and this is why if you

10528
03:26:53,229 --> 03:26:53,239
is and this is why if you
 

10529
03:26:53,239 --> 03:26:56,710
is and this is why if you
look this important um part to build

10530
03:26:56,710 --> 03:26:56,720
look this important um part to build
 

10531
03:26:56,720 --> 03:26:58,510
look this important um part to build
first it's kind of doing it it's just

10532
03:26:58,510 --> 03:26:58,520
first it's kind of doing it it's just
 

10533
03:26:58,520 --> 03:27:01,030
first it's kind of doing it it's just
doing it poorly you're saying I mean

10534
03:27:01,030 --> 03:27:01,040
doing it poorly you're saying I mean
 

10535
03:27:01,040 --> 03:27:02,910
doing it poorly you're saying I mean
that's it is emergent order in some

10536
03:27:02,910 --> 03:27:02,920
that's it is emergent order in some
 

10537
03:27:02,920 --> 03:27:04,030
that's it is emergent order in some
sense I mean that's the hope of

10538
03:27:04,030 --> 03:27:04,040
sense I mean that's the hope of
 

10539
03:27:04,040 --> 03:27:05,750
sense I mean that's the hope of
democracy versus other forms of

10540
03:27:05,750 --> 03:27:05,760
democracy versus other forms of
 

10541
03:27:05,760 --> 03:27:08,030
democracy versus other forms of
government correct I mean I I said at

10542
03:27:08,030 --> 03:27:08,040
government correct I mean I I said at
 

10543
03:27:08,040 --> 03:27:09,870
government correct I mean I I said at
least the story because obviously it

10544
03:27:09,870 --> 03:27:09,880
least the story because obviously it
 

10545
03:27:09,880 --> 03:27:11,590
least the story because obviously it
didn't do it for women and slaves early

10546
03:27:11,590 --> 03:27:11,600
didn't do it for women and slaves early
 

10547
03:27:11,600 --> 03:27:13,110
didn't do it for women and slaves early
on it doesn't do it for all classes

10548
03:27:13,110 --> 03:27:13,120
on it doesn't do it for all classes
 

10549
03:27:13,120 --> 03:27:15,950
on it doesn't do it for all classes
equally Etc but the the idea of

10550
03:27:15,950 --> 03:27:15,960
equally Etc but the the idea of
 

10551
03:27:15,960 --> 03:27:19,510
equally Etc but the the idea of
democracy is that is participatory

10552
03:27:19,510 --> 03:27:19,520
democracy is that is participatory
 

10553
03:27:19,520 --> 03:27:21,630
democracy is that is participatory
governance and so you notice that the

10554
03:27:21,630 --> 03:27:21,640
governance and so you notice that the
 

10555
03:27:21,640 --> 03:27:24,269
governance and so you notice that the
modern democracies emerged out of the

10556
03:27:24,269 --> 03:27:24,279
modern democracies emerged out of the
 

10557
03:27:24,279 --> 03:27:27,750
modern democracies emerged out of the
European Enlightenment and specifically

10558
03:27:27,750 --> 03:27:27,760
European Enlightenment and specifically
 

10559
03:27:27,760 --> 03:27:29,790
European Enlightenment and specifically
because the idea that a lot of people

10560
03:27:29,790 --> 03:27:29,800
because the idea that a lot of people
 

10561
03:27:29,800 --> 03:27:31,309
because the idea that a lot of people
some huge number not a tribal number

10562
03:27:31,309 --> 03:27:31,319
some huge number not a tribal number
 

10563
03:27:31,319 --> 03:27:32,710
some huge number not a tribal number
huge number of anonymous people who

10564
03:27:32,710 --> 03:27:32,720
huge number of anonymous people who
 

10565
03:27:32,720 --> 03:27:34,750
huge number of anonymous people who
don't know each other are not bonded to

10566
03:27:34,750 --> 03:27:34,760
don't know each other are not bonded to
 

10567
03:27:34,760 --> 03:27:36,710
don't know each other are not bonded to
each other who believe different things

10568
03:27:36,710 --> 03:27:36,720
each other who believe different things
 

10569
03:27:36,720 --> 03:27:38,429
each other who believe different things
who grw up in different ways can all

10570
03:27:38,429 --> 03:27:38,439
who grw up in different ways can all
 

10571
03:27:38,439 --> 03:27:39,670
who grw up in different ways can all
work together to make Collective

10572
03:27:39,670 --> 03:27:39,680
work together to make Collective
 

10573
03:27:39,680 --> 03:27:41,910
work together to make Collective
decisions well that affect everybody

10574
03:27:41,910 --> 03:27:41,920
decisions well that affect everybody
 

10575
03:27:41,920 --> 03:27:42,910
decisions well that affect everybody
and where some of them will make

10576
03:27:42,910 --> 03:27:42,920
and where some of them will make
 

10577
03:27:42,920 --> 03:27:44,349
and where some of them will make
compromises in the thing that matters to

10578
03:27:44,349 --> 03:27:44,359
compromises in the thing that matters to
 

10579
03:27:44,359 --> 03:27:46,349
compromises in the thing that matters to
them for what matters to other strangers

10580
03:27:46,349 --> 03:27:46,359
them for what matters to other strangers
 

10581
03:27:46,359 --> 03:27:48,550
them for what matters to other strangers
that's actually wild like it's a wild

10582
03:27:48,550 --> 03:27:48,560
that's actually wild like it's a wild
 

10583
03:27:48,560 --> 03:27:50,710
that's actually wild like it's a wild
idea that that would even be possible

10584
03:27:50,710 --> 03:27:50,720
idea that that would even be possible
 

10585
03:27:50,720 --> 03:27:52,469
idea that that would even be possible
and it was kind of the result of this

10586
03:27:52,469 --> 03:27:52,479
and it was kind of the result of this
 

10587
03:27:52,479 --> 03:27:56,150
and it was kind of the result of this
High enlightenment idea that we could

10588
03:27:56,150 --> 03:27:56,160
High enlightenment idea that we could
 

10589
03:27:56,160 --> 03:27:59,070
High enlightenment idea that we could
all do the philosophy of

10590
03:27:59,070 --> 03:27:59,080
all do the philosophy of
 

10591
03:27:59,080 --> 03:28:01,830
all do the philosophy of
science and we could all do the hegelian

10592
03:28:01,830 --> 03:28:01,840
science and we could all do the hegelian
 

10593
03:28:01,840 --> 03:28:04,269
science and we could all do the hegelian
dialectic those ideas had emerged right

10594
03:28:04,269 --> 03:28:04,279
dialectic those ideas had emerged right
 

10595
03:28:04,279 --> 03:28:06,550
dialectic those ideas had emerged right
and it was

10596
03:28:06,550 --> 03:28:06,560
and it was
 

10597
03:28:06,560 --> 03:28:10,110
and it was
that we we could all so our choic making

10598
03:28:10,110 --> 03:28:10,120
that we we could all so our choic making
 

10599
03:28:10,120 --> 03:28:11,469
that we we could all so our choic making
because we said a society is trying to

03:28:11,469 --> 03:28:11,479
because we said a society is trying to
 

10601
03:28:11,479 --> 03:28:12,950
because we said a society is trying to

whatever do um our choices are based on

thing would be our meaning making is
 

10625
03:28:32,160 --> 03:28:33,750

generation what do we care about that
we're trying to move the world in the

10630
03:28:36,150 --> 03:28:36,160
we're trying to move the world in the
 

10631
03:28:36,160 --> 03:28:38,070
we're trying to move the world in the
direction of if you ultimately are

10632
03:28:38,070 --> 03:28:38,080
direction of if you ultimately are
 

10633
03:28:38,080 --> 03:28:39,950
direction of if you ultimately are
trying to move the world in a direction

10634
03:28:39,950 --> 03:28:39,960
trying to move the world in a direction
 

10635
03:28:39,960 --> 03:28:41,750
trying to move the world in a direction
that is really really different than the

10636
03:28:41,750 --> 03:28:41,760
that is really really different than the
 

10637
03:28:41,760 --> 03:28:43,269
that is really really different than the
direction I'm trying to we have very

10638
03:28:43,269 --> 03:28:43,279
direction I'm trying to we have very
 

10639
03:28:43,279 --> 03:28:44,950
direction I'm trying to we have very
different values we're going to have a

10640
03:28:44,950 --> 03:28:44,960
different values we're going to have a
 

10641
03:28:44,960 --> 03:28:47,150
different values we're going to have a
hard time and if you think the world is

10642
03:28:47,150 --> 03:28:47,160
hard time and if you think the world is
 

10643
03:28:47,160 --> 03:28:49,510
hard time and if you think the world is
a very different world right if you

10644
03:28:49,510 --> 03:28:49,520
a very different world right if you
 

10645
03:28:49,520 --> 03:28:52,750
a very different world right if you
think that systemic racism is rampant

10646
03:28:52,750 --> 03:28:52,760
think that systemic racism is rampant
 

10647
03:28:52,760 --> 03:28:54,070
think that systemic racism is rampant
everywhere and one of the worst problems

10648
03:28:54,070 --> 03:28:54,080
everywhere and one of the worst problems
 

10649
03:28:54,080 --> 03:28:56,349
everywhere and one of the worst problems
and I think it's not even a thing if you

10650
03:28:56,349 --> 03:28:56,359
and I think it's not even a thing if you
 

10651
03:28:56,359 --> 03:28:58,030
and I think it's not even a thing if you
think climate change is almost

10652
03:28:58,030 --> 03:28:58,040
think climate change is almost
 

10653
03:28:58,040 --> 03:28:59,630
think climate change is almost
existential and I think it's not even a

10654
03:28:59,630 --> 03:28:59,640
existential and I think it's not even a
 

10655
03:28:59,640 --> 03:29:00,910
existential and I think it's not even a
thing we're going to have a really hard

10656
03:29:00,910 --> 03:29:00,920
thing we're going to have a really hard
 

10657
03:29:00,920 --> 03:29:03,670
thing we're going to have a really hard
time coordinating and so we have to be

10658
03:29:03,670 --> 03:29:03,680
time coordinating and so we have to be
 

10659
03:29:03,680 --> 03:29:06,070
time coordinating and so we have to be
able to have shared sense making of can

10660
03:29:06,070 --> 03:29:06,080
able to have shared sense making of can
 

10661
03:29:06,080 --> 03:29:08,429
able to have shared sense making of can
we come to understand just what is

10662
03:29:08,429 --> 03:29:08,439
we come to understand just what is
 

10663
03:29:08,439 --> 03:29:11,309
we come to understand just what is
happening together and then can we do

10664
03:29:11,309 --> 03:29:11,319
happening together and then can we do
 

10665
03:29:11,319 --> 03:29:13,110
happening together and then can we do
shared values generation okay maybe I'm

10666
03:29:13,110 --> 03:29:13,120
shared values generation okay maybe I'm
 

10667
03:29:13,120 --> 03:29:14,830
shared values generation okay maybe I'm
emphasizing a particular value more than

10668
03:29:14,830 --> 03:29:14,840
emphasizing a particular value more than
 

10669
03:29:14,840 --> 03:29:16,870
emphasizing a particular value more than
you but I can see how I can take your

10670
03:29:16,870 --> 03:29:16,880
you but I can see how I can take your
 

10671
03:29:16,880 --> 03:29:18,189
you but I can see how I can take your
perspective and I can see how the thing

10672
03:29:18,189 --> 03:29:18,199
perspective and I can see how the thing
 

10673
03:29:18,199 --> 03:29:20,349
perspective and I can see how the thing
that you value is worth valuing and I

10674
03:29:20,349 --> 03:29:20,359
that you value is worth valuing and I
 

10675
03:29:20,359 --> 03:29:22,110
that you value is worth valuing and I
can see how it's affected by this thing

10676
03:29:22,110 --> 03:29:22,120
can see how it's affected by this thing
 

10677
03:29:22,120 --> 03:29:24,189
can see how it's affected by this thing
so can we take all the values and try to

10678
03:29:24,189 --> 03:29:24,199
so can we take all the values and try to
 

10679
03:29:24,199 --> 03:29:25,870
so can we take all the values and try to
come up with a proposition that benefits

10680
03:29:25,870 --> 03:29:25,880
come up with a proposition that benefits
 

10681
03:29:25,880 --> 03:29:27,910
come up with a proposition that benefits
all of them better then the proposition

10682
03:29:27,910 --> 03:29:27,920
all of them better then the proposition
 

10683
03:29:27,920 --> 03:29:29,590
all of them better then the proposition
I created just to benefit these ones it

10684
03:29:29,590 --> 03:29:29,600
I created just to benefit these ones it
 

10685
03:29:29,600 --> 03:29:31,870
I created just to benefit these ones it
harms the ones that you care about which

10686
03:29:31,870 --> 03:29:31,880
harms the ones that you care about which
 

10687
03:29:31,880 --> 03:29:33,670
harms the ones that you care about which
is why you're opposing my proposition

10688
03:29:33,670 --> 03:29:33,680
is why you're opposing my proposition
 

10689
03:29:33,680 --> 03:29:35,910
is why you're opposing my proposition
yeah we don't even try in the process of

10690
03:29:35,910 --> 03:29:35,920
yeah we don't even try in the process of
 

10691
03:29:35,920 --> 03:29:38,950
yeah we don't even try in the process of
crafting a proposition currently to see

10692
03:29:38,950 --> 03:29:38,960
crafting a proposition currently to see
 

10693
03:29:38,960 --> 03:29:40,429
crafting a proposition currently to see
and this is the reason that the

10694
03:29:40,429 --> 03:29:40,439
and this is the reason that the
 

10695
03:29:40,439 --> 03:29:42,030
and this is the reason that the
proposition when we vote on it gets half

10696
03:29:42,030 --> 03:29:42,040
proposition when we vote on it gets half
 

10697
03:29:42,040 --> 03:29:43,750
proposition when we vote on it gets half
the votes almost all the time it almost

10698
03:29:43,750 --> 03:29:43,760
the votes almost all the time it almost
 

10699
03:29:43,760 --> 03:29:46,189
the votes almost all the time it almost
never gets 90% of the votes is because

10700
03:29:46,189 --> 03:29:46,199
never gets 90% of the votes is because
 

10701
03:29:46,199 --> 03:29:47,790
never gets 90% of the votes is because
it benefits some things and harms other

10702
03:29:47,790 --> 03:29:47,800
it benefits some things and harms other
 

10703
03:29:47,800 --> 03:29:48,910
it benefits some things and harms other
things we can say all theory of

10704
03:29:48,910 --> 03:29:48,920
things we can say all theory of
 

10705
03:29:48,920 --> 03:29:51,189
things we can say all theory of
tradeoffs but we didn't even try to say

10706
03:29:51,189 --> 03:29:51,199
tradeoffs but we didn't even try to say
 

10707
03:29:51,199 --> 03:29:53,710
tradeoffs but we didn't even try to say
could we see what everybody cares about

10708
03:29:53,710 --> 03:29:53,720
could we see what everybody cares about
 

10709
03:29:53,720 --> 03:29:55,750
could we see what everybody cares about
and see if there was a better solution

10710
03:29:55,750 --> 03:29:55,760
and see if there was a better solution
 

10711
03:29:55,760 --> 03:29:58,670
and see if there was a better solution
so how do we fix that try I I wonder is

10712
03:29:58,670 --> 03:29:58,680
so how do we fix that try I I wonder is
 

10713
03:29:58,680 --> 03:30:00,349
so how do we fix that try I I wonder is
it is it as simple as the social

10714
03:30:00,349 --> 03:30:00,359
it is it as simple as the social
 

10715
03:30:00,359 --> 03:30:03,229
it is it as simple as the social
technology of Education well no it's

10716
03:30:03,229 --> 03:30:03,239
technology of Education well no it's
 

10717
03:30:03,239 --> 03:30:05,950
technology of Education well no it's
that the proposition crafting and

10718
03:30:05,950 --> 03:30:05,960
that the proposition crafting and
 

10719
03:30:05,960 --> 03:30:08,510
that the proposition crafting and
refinement process has to be key to

10720
03:30:08,510 --> 03:30:08,520
refinement process has to be key to
 

10721
03:30:08,520 --> 03:30:11,229
refinement process has to be key to
democracy or paratory government

10722
03:30:11,229 --> 03:30:11,239
democracy or paratory government
 

10723
03:30:11,239 --> 03:30:13,830
democracy or paratory government
currently but it's the isn't that the

10724
03:30:13,830 --> 03:30:13,840
currently but it's the isn't that the
 

10725
03:30:13,840 --> 03:30:17,229
currently but it's the isn't that the
humans creating that situation so so one

10726
03:30:17,229 --> 03:30:17,239
humans creating that situation so so one
 

10727
03:30:17,239 --> 03:30:19,950
humans creating that situation so so one
ways there's two ways to fix that is the

10728
03:30:19,950 --> 03:30:19,960
ways there's two ways to fix that is the
 

10729
03:30:19,960 --> 03:30:21,670
ways there's two ways to fix that is the
one is to fix the individual humans

10730
03:30:21,670 --> 03:30:21,680
one is to fix the individual humans
 

10731
03:30:21,680 --> 03:30:23,750
one is to fix the individual humans
which is the education early in life and

10732
03:30:23,750 --> 03:30:23,760
which is the education early in life and
 

10733
03:30:23,760 --> 03:30:25,750
which is the education early in life and
the second is to create somehow systems

10734
03:30:25,750 --> 03:30:25,760
the second is to create somehow systems
 

10735
03:30:25,760 --> 03:30:28,830
the second is to create somehow systems
that yeah it's both so I I understand

10736
03:30:28,830 --> 03:30:28,840
that yeah it's both so I I understand
 

10737
03:30:28,840 --> 03:30:31,309
that yeah it's both so I I understand
the education part but creating systems

10738
03:30:31,309 --> 03:30:31,319
the education part but creating systems
 

10739
03:30:31,319 --> 03:30:33,110
the education part but creating systems
that's why that's why I mentioned the

10740
03:30:33,110 --> 03:30:33,120
that's why that's why I mentioned the
 

10741
03:30:33,120 --> 03:30:35,750
that's why that's why I mentioned the
Technologies is creating social networks

10742
03:30:35,750 --> 03:30:35,760
Technologies is creating social networks
 

10743
03:30:35,760 --> 03:30:36,950
Technologies is creating social networks
essentially yes that's actually

10744
03:30:36,950 --> 03:30:36,960
essentially yes that's actually
 

10745
03:30:36,960 --> 03:30:38,830
essentially yes that's actually
necessary okay so let's go to the first

10746
03:30:38,830 --> 03:30:38,840
necessary okay so let's go to the first
 

10747
03:30:38,840 --> 03:30:40,030
necessary okay so let's go to the first
part and then we'll come to the second

10748
03:30:40,030 --> 03:30:40,040
part and then we'll come to the second
 

10749
03:30:40,040 --> 03:30:41,790
part and then we'll come to the second
part

10750
03:30:41,790 --> 03:30:41,800
part
 

10751
03:30:41,800 --> 03:30:44,389
part
so democracy emerged as an Enlightenment

10752
03:30:44,389 --> 03:30:44,399
so democracy emerged as an Enlightenment
 

10753
03:30:44,399 --> 03:30:48,189
so democracy emerged as an Enlightenment
era idea that we could all do a

10754
03:30:48,189 --> 03:30:48,199
era idea that we could all do a
 

10755
03:30:48,199 --> 03:30:49,990
era idea that we could all do a
dialectic and come to understand what

10756
03:30:49,990 --> 03:30:50,000
dialectic and come to understand what
 

10757
03:30:50,000 --> 03:30:52,630
dialectic and come to understand what
other people valued and so that we could

10758
03:30:52,630 --> 03:30:52,640
other people valued and so that we could
 

10759
03:30:52,640 --> 03:30:55,870
other people valued and so that we could
actually come up with a Cooperative

10760
03:30:55,870 --> 03:30:55,880
actually come up with a Cooperative
 

10761
03:30:55,880 --> 03:30:58,269
actually come up with a Cooperative
solution rather than just [\h__\h] you we're

10762
03:30:58,269 --> 03:30:58,279
solution rather than just [\h__\h] you we're
 

10763
03:30:58,279 --> 03:31:00,429
solution rather than just [\h__\h] you we're
going to get our thing in war right and

10764
03:31:00,429 --> 03:31:00,439
going to get our thing in war right and
 

10765
03:31:00,439 --> 03:31:01,590
going to get our thing in war right and
that we could sense make together we

10766
03:31:01,590 --> 03:31:01,600
that we could sense make together we
 

10767
03:31:01,600 --> 03:31:02,750
that we could sense make together we
could all apply the philosophy of

10768
03:31:02,750 --> 03:31:02,760
could all apply the philosophy of
 

10769
03:31:02,760 --> 03:31:04,590
could all apply the philosophy of
science and you weren't going to stick

10770
03:31:04,590 --> 03:31:04,600
science and you weren't going to stick
 

10771
03:31:04,600 --> 03:31:05,950
science and you weren't going to stick
to your guns on what the speed of sound

10772
03:31:05,950 --> 03:31:05,960
to your guns on what the speed of sound
 

10773
03:31:05,960 --> 03:31:07,229
to your guns on what the speed of sound
is if we measured it and we found out

10774
03:31:07,229 --> 03:31:07,239
is if we measured it and we found out
 

10775
03:31:07,239 --> 03:31:09,150
is if we measured it and we found out
what it was and there's a unifying

10776
03:31:09,150 --> 03:31:09,160
what it was and there's a unifying
 

10777
03:31:09,160 --> 03:31:11,870
what it was and there's a unifying
element to the objectivity in that way

10778
03:31:11,870 --> 03:31:11,880
element to the objectivity in that way
 

10779
03:31:11,880 --> 03:31:14,630
element to the objectivity in that way
and so this is why um I believe

10780
03:31:14,630 --> 03:31:14,640
and so this is why um I believe
 

10781
03:31:14,640 --> 03:31:16,229
and so this is why um I believe
Jefferson said if you could give me a

government or in paraphrasing or a
broken government in perfect newspaper I

10788
03:31:20,870 --> 03:31:20,880
broken government in perfect newspaper I
 

10789
03:31:20,880 --> 03:31:21,910
broken government in perfect newspaper I
wouldn't hesitate to take the perfect

10790
03:31:21,910 --> 03:31:21,920
wouldn't hesitate to take the perfect
 

10791
03:31:21,920 --> 03:31:23,349
wouldn't hesitate to take the perfect
newspaper because if the people

all the things that lead to how we

10824
03:31:55,429 --> 03:31:55,439
all the things that lead to how we
 

10825
03:31:55,439 --> 03:31:57,550
all the things that lead to how we
understand human coordination I think

10826
03:31:57,550 --> 03:31:57,560
understand human coordination I think
 

10827
03:31:57,560 --> 03:32:00,469
understand human coordination I think
it's so profound that he didn't say the

10828
03:32:00,469 --> 03:32:00,479
it's so profound that he didn't say the
 

10829
03:32:00,479 --> 03:32:01,990
it's so profound that he didn't say the
number one aim of the federal government

10830
03:32:01,990 --> 03:32:02,000
number one aim of the federal government
 

10831
03:32:02,000 --> 03:32:03,150
number one aim of the federal government
is rule of

10832
03:32:03,150 --> 03:32:03,160
is rule of
 

10833
03:32:03,160 --> 03:32:05,429
is rule of
law and he didn't say it's protecting

10834
03:32:05,429 --> 03:32:05,439
law and he didn't say it's protecting
 

10835
03:32:05,439 --> 03:32:07,990
law and he didn't say it's protecting
the border from enemies because if the

10836
03:32:07,990 --> 03:32:08,000
the border from enemies because if the
 

10837
03:32:08,000 --> 03:32:09,630
the border from enemies because if the
number one aim was to protect the border

10838
03:32:09,630 --> 03:32:09,640
number one aim was to protect the border
 

10839
03:32:09,640 --> 03:32:11,670
number one aim was to protect the border
from enemies it could do that as

10840
03:32:11,670 --> 03:32:11,680
from enemies it could do that as
 

10841
03:32:11,680 --> 03:32:14,349
from enemies it could do that as
military dictatorship quite effectively

10842
03:32:14,349 --> 03:32:14,359
military dictatorship quite effectively
 

10843
03:32:14,359 --> 03:32:16,510
military dictatorship quite effectively
and if the goal was rule of law it could

10844
03:32:16,510 --> 03:32:16,520
and if the goal was rule of law it could
 

10845
03:32:16,520 --> 03:32:19,830
and if the goal was rule of law it could
do it as a dictatorship as a police

10846
03:32:19,830 --> 03:32:19,840
do it as a dictatorship as a police
 

10847
03:32:19,840 --> 03:32:22,750
do it as a dictatorship as a police

discussion but I I don't think we're

11004
03:35:01,510 --> 03:35:01,520
discussion but I I don't think we're
 

11005
03:35:01,520 --> 03:35:04,070
discussion but I I don't think we're
quite quantifying the impact on the

03:35:04,070 --> 03:35:04,080
quite quantifying the impact on the

03:35:15,870 --> 03:35:15,880
um empathy that what could like
 

11015
03:35:15,880 --> 03:35:20,469

approach the every other communication
you engage in even if the system of that

03:36:51,309 --> 03:36:51,319
you engage in even if the system of that
 

11089
03:36:51,319 --> 03:36:53,429
you engage in even if the system of that
communication is very much flawed so I

11090
03:36:53,429 --> 03:36:53,439
communication is very much flawed so I
 

11091
03:36:53,439 --> 03:36:54,910
communication is very much flawed so I
think there's a huge positive effect on

11092

11094
03:36:56,990 --> 03:36:57,000
Wikipedia that's my case for Wikipedia
 

11095
03:36:57,000 --> 03:36:59,469
Wikipedia that's my case for Wikipedia
so you should donate to Wikipedia I I'm

11096
03:36:59,469 --> 03:36:59,479
so you should donate to Wikipedia I I'm
 

11097

so you should donate to Wikipedia I I'm
I'm a huge fan but there's very few

11098
03:37:01,590 --> 03:37:01,600
I'm a huge fan but there's very few
 

11099
03:37:01,600 --> 03:37:04,990
I'm a huge fan but there's very few
systems like it which is sad to me so I

11100
03:37:04,990 --> 03:37:05,000
systems like it which is sad to me so I
 

11101
03:37:05,000 --> 03:37:08,469
systems like it which is sad to me so I
think it's it would be a useful exercise

11102
03:37:08,469 --> 03:37:08,479
think it's it would be a useful exercise

like Triston Harris take and say what
are all of the things that are getting

are all of the things that are getting

03:37:34,479 --> 03:37:37,269
are all of the things that are getting
worse and what and are any of them

worse and what and are any of them
 

11121
03:37:37,279 --> 03:37:38,870
worse and what and are any of them
following an exponential curve and how

11122
03:37:38,870 --> 03:37:38,880
following an exponential curve and how
 

11123
03:37:38,880 --> 03:37:42,469
following an exponential curve and how
much worse how quickly could that be

mitigating it then take the Techno

11128

Optimist perspective and see what things

or diamandis or someone might do and try
 

11135
03:37:55,960 --> 03:37:57,670
or diamandis or someone might do and try
to take that perspective fully and say

11136
03:37:57,670 --> 03:37:57,680
to take that perspective fully and say
 

11137
03:37:57,680 --> 03:37:59,070
to take that perspective fully and say
are some of those things exponential

11138
03:37:59,070 --> 03:37:59,080
are some of those things exponential
 

11139
03:37:59,080 --> 03:38:00,389
are some of those things exponential
what what could that portend and then

11140
03:38:00,389 --> 03:38:00,399
what what could that portend and then
 

11141
03:38:00,399 --> 03:38:02,309
what what could that portend and then
try to hold all that at the same

11142
03:38:02,309 --> 03:38:02,319
try to hold all that at the same
 

11143
03:38:02,319 --> 03:38:07,590
try to hold all that at the same
time and I think there are ways in

11144
03:38:07,590 --> 03:38:07,600
time and I think there are ways in
 

11145
03:38:07,600 --> 03:38:09,750
time and I think there are ways in
which depending upon the metrics we're

11146
03:38:09,750 --> 03:38:09,760
which depending upon the metrics we're
 

11147
03:38:09,760 --> 03:38:12,110
which depending upon the metrics we're
looking at things are getting worse on

11148
03:38:12,110 --> 03:38:12,120
looking at things are getting worse on
 

11149
03:38:12,120 --> 03:38:13,550
looking at things are getting worse on
exponential curves and better on

11150
03:38:13,550 --> 03:38:13,560
exponential curves and better on
 

11151
03:38:13,560 --> 03:38:15,469
exponential curves and better on
exponential curves for different metrics

11152
03:38:15,469 --> 03:38:15,479
exponential curves for different metrics
 

11153
03:38:15,479 --> 03:38:17,349
exponential curves for different metrics
at the same time which which I hold is

11154
03:38:17,349 --> 03:38:17,359
at the same time which which I hold is
 

11155
03:38:17,359 --> 03:38:20,670
at the same time which which I hold is

11431
03:43:35,640 --> 03:43:37,510
profit motive and um and as I'm
interacting with it it has a goal for me

11432
03:43:37,510 --> 03:43:37,520
interacting with it it has a goal for me
 

11433
03:43:37,520 --> 03:43:39,910
interacting with it it has a goal for me
different than my goal for myself and

11434
03:43:39,910 --> 03:43:39,920
different than my goal for myself and
 

11435
03:43:39,920 --> 03:43:41,070
different than my goal for myself and
and I might want to be on for a short

11436
03:43:41,070 --> 03:43:41,080
and I might want to be on for a short
 

11437
03:43:41,080 --> 03:43:42,710
and I might want to be on for a short
period of time its goal is maximize time

11438
03:43:42,710 --> 03:43:42,720
period of time its goal is maximize time
 

11439
03:43:42,720 --> 03:43:45,990

on site and so there is a rivalry that

11440
03:43:45,990 --> 03:43:46,000
on site and so there is a rivalry that
 

11441
03:43:46,000 --> 03:43:48,070
on site and so there is a rivalry that
is take but where there should be a

11442
03:43:48,070 --> 03:43:48,080
is take but where there should be a
 

11443
03:43:48,080 --> 03:43:50,429
is take but where there should be a
fiduciary contract I think that's

11444
03:43:50,429 --> 03:43:50,439
fiduciary contract I think that's
 

11445
03:43:50,439 --> 03:43:53,670
fiduciary contract I think that's
actually a huge deal and I think if we

11446
03:43:53,670 --> 03:43:53,680
actually a huge deal and I think if we
 

11447
03:43:53,680 --> 03:43:57,030
actually a huge deal and I think if we
said could we apply Facebook like

11448
03:43:57,030 --> 03:43:57,040
said could we apply Facebook like
 

11449
03:43:57,040 --> 03:44:01,070
said could we apply Facebook like

03:47:05,640 --> 03:47:07,149
on the supply side Supply started to
recognize that it could manufacture

11624
03:47:07,149 --> 03:47:07,159
recognize that it could manufacture
 

11625
03:47:07,159 --> 03:47:08,990
recognize that it could manufacture
demand it could make people want [\h__\h]

11626
03:47:08,990 --> 03:47:09,000
demand it could make people want [\h__\h]
 

11627
03:47:09,000 --> 03:47:10,189
demand it could make people want [\h__\h]
that they didn't want before that maybe

11628
03:47:10,189 --> 03:47:10,199
that they didn't want before that maybe
 

11629
03:47:10,199 --> 03:47:12,110
that they didn't want before that maybe
wouldn't increase their happiness in a

11630
03:47:12,110 --> 03:47:12,120
wouldn't increase their happiness in a
 

11631
03:47:12,120 --> 03:47:14,030
wouldn't increase their happiness in a
meaningful way might increase addiction

11632
03:47:14,030 --> 03:47:14,040
meaningful way might increase addiction
 

11633
03:47:14,040 --> 03:47:15,110
meaningful way might increase addiction
addiction is a very good way to

11634
03:47:15,110 --> 03:47:15,120
addiction is a very good way to
 

11635
03:47:15,120 --> 03:47:16,269
addiction is a very good way to
manufacture

11636
03:47:16,269 --> 03:47:16,279
manufacture
 

11637
03:47:16,279 --> 03:47:19,670
manufacture
demand and so as soon as manufactured

11638
03:47:19,670 --> 03:47:19,680
demand and so as soon as manufactured
 

11639
03:47:19,680 --> 03:47:23,110
demand and so as soon as manufactured
demand started through this is the cool

11640
03:47:23,110 --> 03:47:23,120
demand started through this is the cool
 

11641
03:47:23,120 --> 03:47:24,510
demand started through this is the cool
thing and you have to have it for status

11642
03:47:24,510 --> 03:47:24,520
thing and you have to have it for status
 

11643
03:47:24,520 --> 03:47:27,110
thing and you have to have it for status
or whatever it is the intelligence of

03:47:27,110 --> 03:47:27,120
or whatever it is the intelligence of
 

11645
03:47:27,120 --> 03:47:29,229
or whatever it is the intelligence of
the market was breaking now it's no

11646
03:47:29,229 --> 03:47:29,239
the market was breaking now it's no
 

11647
03:47:29,239 --> 03:47:30,790
the market was breaking now it's no
longer collective intelligence system

11648
03:47:30,790 --> 03:47:30,800
longer collective intelligence system
 

11649
03:47:30,800 --> 03:47:32,990
longer collective intelligence system
that is upregulating real desire for

11650
03:47:32,990 --> 03:47:33,000
that is upregulating real desire for
 

11651
03:47:33,000 --> 03:47:34,349
that is upregulating real desire for
things that are really meaningful you're

11652
03:47:34,349 --> 03:47:34,359
things that are really meaningful you're
 

11653
03:47:34,359 --> 03:47:36,790
things that are really meaningful you're
able to hijack the lower angels of our

11654
03:47:36,790 --> 03:47:36,800
able to hijack the lower angels of our
 

11655
03:47:36,800 --> 03:47:38,149
able to hijack the lower angels of our
nature rather than the higher ones The

11656
03:47:38,149 --> 03:47:38,159
nature rather than the higher ones The
 

11657
03:47:38,159 --> 03:47:40,630
nature rather than the higher ones The
Addictive patterns Drive those and have

11658
03:47:40,630 --> 03:47:40,640
Addictive patterns Drive those and have
 

11659
03:47:40,640 --> 03:47:41,870
Addictive patterns Drive those and have
people want [\h__\h] that doesn't actually

11660
03:47:41,870 --> 03:47:41,880
people want [\h__\h] that doesn't actually
 

11661
03:47:41,880 --> 03:47:43,189
people want [\h__\h] that doesn't actually
make them happier or make the world

11662
03:47:43,189 --> 03:47:43,199
make them happier or make the world
 

11663
03:47:43,199 --> 03:47:47,189
make them happier or make the world
better and so we really also have to we

11664
03:47:47,189 --> 03:47:47,199
better and so we really also have to we
 

11665
03:47:47,199 --> 03:47:49,030
better and so we really also have to we
have to update our theory of markets

11666
03:47:49,030 --> 03:47:49,040
have to update our theory of markets
 

11667
03:47:49,040 --> 03:47:51,269
have to update our theory of markets
because behavioral econ showed that

11668
03:47:51,269 --> 03:47:51,279
because behavioral econ showed that
 

11669
03:47:51,279 --> 03:47:53,510
because behavioral econ showed that
homoeconomicus the rational actor is not

03:47:53,510 --> 03:47:53,520
homoeconomicus the rational actor is not
 

11671
03:47:53,520 --> 03:47:55,670
homoeconomicus the rational actor is not
really a thing but particularly at

really a thing but particularly at

03:47:55,680 --> 03:47:57,269
really a thing but particularly at
greater and greater scale can't really

greater and greater scale can't really
 

11675
03:47:57,279 --> 03:47:59,269
greater and greater scale can't really
be a thing voluntarism isn't a thing

11676
03:47:59,269 --> 03:47:59,279
be a thing voluntarism isn't a thing
 

11677
03:47:59,279 --> 03:48:00,950
be a thing voluntarism isn't a thing
where if my Corp if my company doesn't

11678
03:48:00,950 --> 03:48:00,960
where if my Corp if my company doesn't
 

11679
03:48:00,960 --> 03:48:02,670
where if my Corp if my company doesn't
want to advertise on Facebook I just

11680
03:48:02,670 --> 03:48:02,680
want to advertise on Facebook I just
 

11681
03:48:02,680 --> 03:48:04,189

will lose to the companies that do

11682
03:48:04,189 --> 03:48:04,199
will lose to the companies that do
 

11683
03:48:04,199 --> 03:48:04,990
will lose to the companies that do
because that's where all the [\h__\h]

11684
03:48:04,990 --> 03:48:05,000
because that's where all the [\h__\h]
 

11685
03:48:05,000 --> 03:48:07,670
because that's where all the [\h__\h]
attention is and so then I can say it's

11686
03:48:07,670 --> 03:48:07,680
attention is and so then I can say it's
 

11687
03:48:07,680 --> 03:48:09,229
attention is and so then I can say it's
voluntary but it's not really if there's

11688
03:48:09,229 --> 03:48:09,239
voluntary but it's not really if there's
 

11689
03:48:09,239 --> 03:48:10,670
voluntary but it's not really if there's
a functional

Monopoly same if I'm going to sell on

11692
03:48:12,910 --> 03:48:12,920
Monopoly same if I'm going to sell on
 

11693
03:48:12,920 --> 03:48:16,550
Monopoly same if I'm going to sell on
Amazon or things like that so um what I

11694
03:48:16,550 --> 03:48:16,560
Amazon or things like that so um what I
 

11695
03:48:16,560 --> 03:48:18,590
Amazon or things like that so um what I
would say is the these corporations are

11696
03:48:18,590 --> 03:48:18,600
would say is the these corporations are
 

11697
03:48:18,600 --> 03:48:21,349
would say is the these corporations are
becoming more powerful than nation

11698
03:48:21,349 --> 03:48:21,359
becoming more powerful than nation
 

11699
03:48:21,359 --> 03:48:22,630
becoming more powerful than nation
states in some

11700
03:48:22,630 --> 03:48:22,640
states in some
 

11701
03:48:22,640 --> 03:48:26,469
states in some
ways

11702
03:48:26,469 --> 03:48:26,479

 

11703
03:48:26,479 --> 03:48:31,429

and they are also debasing the Integrity

11704
03:48:31,429 --> 03:48:31,439
and they are also debasing the Integrity
 

11705
03:48:31,439 --> 03:48:33,750
and they are also debasing the Integrity
of the nation states the open societies

11706
03:48:33,750 --> 03:48:33,760
of the nation states the open societies
 

11707
03:48:33,760 --> 03:48:35,910
of the nation states the open societies
so the democracies are getting weaker as

11708
03:48:35,910 --> 03:48:35,920
so the democracies are getting weaker as
 

11709
03:48:35,920 --> 03:48:38,429
so the democracies are getting weaker as
a result of exponential Tech and the

11710
03:48:38,429 --> 03:48:38,439
a result of exponential Tech and the
 

11711
03:48:38,439 --> 03:48:40,670
a result of exponential Tech and the
kind of new tech companies that are kind

11712
03:48:40,670 --> 03:48:40,680
kind of new tech companies that are kind
 

11713
03:48:40,680 --> 03:48:42,790
kind of new tech companies that are kind
of a new feudalism Tech feudalism

11714
03:48:42,790 --> 03:48:42,800
of a new feudalism Tech feudalism
 

11715
03:48:42,800 --> 03:48:44,469
of a new feudalism Tech feudalism
because it's not a democracy inside of a

11716
03:48:44,469 --> 03:48:44,479
because it's not a democracy inside of a
 

11717
03:48:44,479 --> 03:48:46,750
because it's not a democracy inside of a
tech company or the supply and demand

11718
03:48:46,750 --> 03:48:46,760
tech company or the supply and demand
 

11719
03:48:46,760 --> 03:48:48,349
tech company or the supply and demand
relationship um when you have

11720
03:48:48,349 --> 03:48:48,359
relationship um when you have
 

11721
03:48:48,359 --> 03:48:51,070
relationship um when you have
manufactured demand and kind of Monopoly

11722
03:48:51,070 --> 03:48:51,080
manufactured demand and kind of Monopoly
 

11723
03:48:51,080 --> 03:48:51,990
manufactured demand and kind of Monopoly
type

11724
03:48:51,990 --> 03:48:52,000
type
 

11725
03:48:52,000 --> 03:48:54,149
type
functions and so we have basically a new

11726
03:48:54,149 --> 03:48:54,159
functions and so we have basically a new
 

11727
03:48:54,159 --> 03:48:55,870
functions and so we have basically a new
feudalism controlling exponential Tech

11728
03:48:55,870 --> 03:48:55,880
feudalism controlling exponential Tech
 

11729
03:48:55,880 --> 03:48:57,309
feudalism controlling exponential Tech
and authoritarian nation states

11730
03:48:57,309 --> 03:48:57,319
and authoritarian nation states
 

11731
03:48:57,319 --> 03:48:59,229
and authoritarian nation states
controlling it and those attractors are

11732
03:48:59,229 --> 03:48:59,239
controlling it and those attractors are
 

11733
03:48:59,239 --> 03:48:59,910
controlling it and those attractors are
both

11734
03:48:59,910 --> 03:48:59,920
both
 

11735
03:48:59,920 --> 03:49:02,550
both
shitty and so I'm interested in the

11736
03:49:02,550 --> 03:49:02,560
shitty and so I'm interested in the
 

11737
03:49:02,560 --> 03:49:05,670
shitty and so I'm interested in the
application of exponential Tech to

11738
03:49:05,670 --> 03:49:05,680
application of exponential Tech to
 

11739
03:49:05,680 --> 03:49:07,550
application of exponential Tech to
making better social Tech that makes

11740
03:49:07,550 --> 03:49:07,560
making better social Tech that makes
 

11741
03:49:07,560 --> 03:49:10,070
making better social Tech that makes
emergent order possible

11742
03:49:10,070 --> 03:49:10,080
emergent order possible
 

11743
03:49:10,080 --> 03:49:12,030
emergent order possible
and where then that emergent order can

11744
03:49:12,030 --> 03:49:12,040
and where then that emergent order can
 

11745
03:49:12,040 --> 03:49:15,030
and where then that emergent order can
bind and direct the exponential Tech in

11746
03:49:15,030 --> 03:49:15,040
bind and direct the exponential Tech in
 

11747
03:49:15,040 --> 03:49:17,510
bind and direct the exponential Tech in
fundamentally healthy not X risk

11748
03:49:17,510 --> 03:49:17,520
fundamentally healthy not X risk
 

11749
03:49:17,520 --> 03:49:19,630
fundamentally healthy not X risk
oriented directions I think the

11750
03:49:19,630 --> 03:49:19,640
oriented directions I think the
 

11751
03:49:19,640 --> 03:49:21,630
oriented directions I think the
relationship of social Tech and physical

11752
03:49:21,630 --> 03:49:21,640
relationship of social Tech and physical
 

11753
03:49:21,640 --> 03:49:23,309
relationship of social Tech and physical
Tech can make it I think we can actually

11754
03:49:23,309 --> 03:49:23,319
Tech can make it I think we can actually
 

11755
03:49:23,319 --> 03:49:24,950
Tech can make it I think we can actually
use the physical Tech to make better

11756
03:49:24,950 --> 03:49:24,960
use the physical Tech to make better
 

11757
03:49:24,960 --> 03:49:26,870
use the physical Tech to make better
social Tech but it's not given that we

11758
03:49:26,870 --> 03:49:26,880
social Tech but it's not given that we
 

11759
03:49:26,880 --> 03:49:30,149
social Tech but it's not given that we
do if we don't make better social Tech

11760
03:49:30,149 --> 03:49:30,159
do if we don't make better social Tech
 

11761
03:49:30,159 --> 03:49:31,790
do if we don't make better social Tech
then I think the physical Tech empowers

11762
03:49:31,790 --> 03:49:31,800
then I think the physical Tech empowers
 

11763
03:49:31,800 --> 03:49:33,189
then I think the physical Tech empowers
really shitty social Tech that it's not

11764
03:49:33,189 --> 03:49:33,199
really shitty social Tech that it's not
 

11765
03:49:33,199 --> 03:49:35,510
really shitty social Tech that it's not
a world that we want I don't know if

11766
03:49:35,510 --> 03:49:35,520
a world that we want I don't know if
 

11767
03:49:35,520 --> 03:49:38,149
a world that we want I don't know if
it's a road we want to go down but I

11768
03:49:38,149 --> 03:49:38,159
it's a road we want to go down but I
 

11769
03:49:38,159 --> 03:49:39,630
it's a road we want to go down but I
tend to believe that the market Market

11770
03:49:39,630 --> 03:49:39,640
tend to believe that the market Market
 

11771
03:49:39,640 --> 03:49:41,429
tend to believe that the market Market
will create exactly the thing you're

11772
03:49:41,429 --> 03:49:41,439
will create exactly the thing you're
 

11773
03:49:41,439 --> 03:49:43,070
will create exactly the thing you're
talking about which I feel like there's

11774
03:49:43,070 --> 03:49:43,080
talking about which I feel like there's
 

11775
03:49:43,080 --> 03:49:46,429
talking about which I feel like there's
a lot of money to be made in

11776
03:49:46,429 --> 03:49:46,439
a lot of money to be made in

11818
03:50:43,830 --> 03:50:43,840
and what I guess if not then how do we
 

11819

two or 300,000 years I think social Tech

11828
03:50:56,550 --> 03:50:56,560
two or 300,000 years I think social Tech
 

11829
03:50:56,560 --> 03:50:58,510
two or 300,000 years I think social Tech
has to keep evolving the social

on producing the goods and services so I

11902
03:52:26,229 --> 03:52:26,239
on producing the goods and services so I
 

11903
03:52:26,239 --> 03:52:27,670
on producing the goods and services so I
stop even paying attention to goods and

11904

stop even paying attention to goods and
 

11905
03:52:27,680 --> 03:52:29,590
stop even paying attention to goods and

services and start paying attention to
 

11907
03:52:29,600 --> 03:52:31,510

03:52:31,510 --> 03:52:31,520
making money on money and how do I
 

11909
03:52:31,520 --> 03:52:34,110
making money on money and how do I
utilize Capital to create more capital

utilize Capital to create more capital
 

11911
03:52:34,120 --> 03:52:36,149
utilize Capital to create more capital
and capital gives me more optionality

11912
03:52:36,149 --> 03:52:36,159
and capital gives me more optionality
 

11913
03:52:36,159 --> 03:52:37,389
and capital gives me more optionality
because I can buy anything with it than

03:52:56,600 --> 03:52:58,030
land novel access to Resource mines and
put more technology under my employment

11934
03:52:58,030 --> 03:52:58,040
put more technology under my employment
 

11935
03:52:58,040 --> 03:52:59,750
put more technology under my employment
so it meant increased agency and also

11936
03:52:59,750 --> 03:52:59,760
so it meant increased agency and also
 

11937
03:52:59,760 --> 03:53:01,349
so it meant increased agency and also
increased

11938
03:53:01,349 --> 03:53:01,359
increased
 

11939
03:53:01,359 --> 03:53:06,630
increased
control I think ationalism is even more

11940
03:53:06,630 --> 03:53:06,640

 

11941
03:53:06,640 --> 03:53:11,550

powerful so rather than enslave people

11942
03:53:11,550 --> 03:53:11,560
powerful so rather than enslave people
 

11943
03:53:11,560 --> 03:53:13,189
powerful so rather than enslave people
where the people kind of always want to

11944
03:53:13,189 --> 03:53:13,199
where the people kind of always want to
 

11945
03:53:13,199 --> 03:53:15,389
where the people kind of always want to
get away and put in the least work they

11946
03:53:15,389 --> 03:53:15,399
get away and put in the least work they
 

11947
03:53:15,399 --> 03:53:17,510
get away and put in the least work they
can there's a way in which economic

11948
03:53:17,510 --> 03:53:17,520
can there's a way in which economic
 

11949
03:53:17,520 --> 03:53:19,389
can there's a way in which economic
servitude was just more profitable than

11950
03:53:19,389 --> 03:53:19,399
servitude was just more profitable than
 

11951
03:53:19,399 --> 03:53:22,870
servitude was just more profitable than
slavery right have the people work even

11952
03:53:22,870 --> 03:53:22,880
slavery right have the people work even
 

11953
03:53:22,880 --> 03:53:24,349
slavery right have the people work even
harder voluntarily because they want to

11954
03:53:24,349 --> 03:53:24,359
harder voluntarily because they want to
 

11955
03:53:24,359 --> 03:53:27,389
harder voluntarily because they want to
get ahead and nobody has to be there to

11956
03:53:27,389 --> 03:53:27,399
get ahead and nobody has to be there to
 

11957
03:53:27,399 --> 03:53:29,590
get ahead and nobody has to be there to
whip them or control them or

11958
03:53:29,590 --> 03:53:29,600
whip them or control them or
 

11959
03:53:29,600 --> 03:53:33,309
whip them or control them or
whatever this is a a cynical take but it

11960
03:53:33,309 --> 03:53:33,319
whatever this is a a cynical take but it
 

11961
03:53:33,319 --> 03:53:36,070
whatever this is a a cynical take but it
a meaningful take um

11962
03:53:36,070 --> 03:53:36,080
a meaningful take um
 

11963
03:53:36,080 --> 03:53:37,950
a meaningful take um
so

11964
03:53:37,950 --> 03:53:37,960
so
 

11965
03:53:37,960 --> 03:53:40,710
so
people so Capital ends up being a way to

11966
03:53:40,710 --> 03:53:40,720
people so Capital ends up being a way to
 

11967
03:53:40,720 --> 03:53:44,070
people so Capital ends up being a way to
influence human behavior right and

11968
03:53:44,070 --> 03:53:44,080
influence human behavior right and
 

11969
03:53:44,080 --> 03:53:47,630
influence human behavior right and
yet where people still feel free in some

11970
03:53:47,630 --> 03:53:47,640
yet where people still feel free in some
 

11971
03:53:47,640 --> 03:53:49,830
yet where people still feel free in some
meaningful way they they're not feeling

11972
03:53:49,830 --> 03:53:49,840
meaningful way they they're not feeling
 

11973
03:53:49,840 --> 03:53:51,790
meaningful way they they're not feeling
like uh they're going to be punished by

11974
03:53:51,790 --> 03:53:51,800
like uh they're going to be punished by
 

11975
03:53:51,800 --> 03:53:53,309
like uh they're going to be punished by
the state if they don't do something

11976
03:53:53,309 --> 03:53:53,319
the state if they don't do something
 

11977
03:53:53,319 --> 03:53:54,910
the state if they don't do something
it's like punished by the market via

11978
03:53:54,910 --> 03:53:54,920
it's like punished by the market via
 

11979
03:53:54,920 --> 03:53:56,990
it's like punished by the market via
homelessness or something but the market

11980
03:53:56,990 --> 03:53:57,000
homelessness or something but the market
 

11981
03:53:57,000 --> 03:53:58,590
homelessness or something but the market
is this invisible thing I can't put an

11982
03:53:58,590 --> 03:53:58,600
is this invisible thing I can't put an
 

11983
03:53:58,600 --> 03:54:03,349
is this invisible thing I can't put an
agent on so it feels like free and so

11984
03:54:03,349 --> 03:54:03,359
agent on so it feels like free and so
 

11985
03:54:03,359 --> 03:54:07,110
agent on so it feels like free and so
if if you want to affect people's

11986
03:54:07,110 --> 03:54:07,120
if if you want to affect people's
 

11987
03:54:07,120 --> 03:54:10,229
if if you want to affect people's
behavior and still have them feel free

11988
03:54:10,229 --> 03:54:10,239
behavior and still have them feel free
 

11989
03:54:10,239 --> 03:54:12,389
behavior and still have them feel free
Capital ends up being a way to do that

11990
03:54:12,389 --> 03:54:12,399
Capital ends up being a way to do that
 

11991
03:54:12,399 --> 03:54:14,389
Capital ends up being a way to do that
but I think affecting their attention is

11992
03:54:14,389 --> 03:54:14,399
but I think affecting their attention is
 

11993
03:54:14,399 --> 03:54:16,550
but I think affecting their attention is
even deeper because if I can affect

11994
03:54:16,550 --> 03:54:16,560
even deeper because if I can affect
 

11995
03:54:16,560 --> 03:54:17,389
even deeper because if I can affect
their

11996
03:54:17,389 --> 03:54:17,399
their
 

11997
03:54:17,399 --> 03:54:19,830
their
attention I can both affect what they

11998
03:54:19,830 --> 03:54:19,840
attention I can both affect what they
 

11999
03:54:19,840 --> 03:54:22,229
attention I can both affect what they
want and what they believe and what they

12000
03:54:22,229 --> 03:54:22,239
want and what they believe and what they
 

12001
03:54:22,239 --> 03:54:24,189
want and what they believe and what they
feel and we statistically know this very

12002
03:54:24,189 --> 03:54:24,199
feel and we statistically know this very
 

12003
03:54:24,199 --> 03:54:25,790
feel and we statistically know this very
clearly Facebook has done studies that

12004
03:54:25,790 --> 03:54:25,800
clearly Facebook has done studies that
 

12005
03:54:25,800 --> 03:54:28,389
clearly Facebook has done studies that
based on changing the feed it can change

12006
03:54:28,389 --> 03:54:28,399
based on changing the feed it can change
 

12007
03:54:28,399 --> 03:54:32,030
based on changing the feed it can change
beliefs emotional dispositions Etc and

12008
03:54:32,030 --> 03:54:32,040
beliefs emotional dispositions Etc and
 

12009
03:54:32,040 --> 03:54:33,910
beliefs emotional dispositions Etc and
so I think there's a way that

12010
03:54:33,910 --> 03:54:33,920
so I think there's a way that
 

12011
03:54:33,920 --> 03:54:36,630
so I think there's a way that
the the harvest and directing of

12012
03:54:36,630 --> 03:54:36,640
the the harvest and directing of
 

12013
03:54:36,640 --> 03:54:38,750
the the harvest and directing of
attention is even a more powerful system

12014
03:54:38,750 --> 03:54:38,760
attention is even a more powerful system
 

12015
03:54:38,760 --> 03:54:41,110
attention is even a more powerful system
than than capitalism it is effective in

12016
03:54:41,110 --> 03:54:41,120
than than capitalism it is effective in
 

12017
03:54:41,120 --> 03:54:42,910
than than capitalism it is effective in
capitalism to generate Capital but I

12018
03:54:42,910 --> 03:54:42,920
capitalism to generate Capital but I
 

12019
03:54:42,920 --> 03:54:45,030
capitalism to generate Capital but I
think it also generates influence beyond

12020
03:54:45,030 --> 03:54:45,040
think it also generates influence beyond
 

12021
03:54:45,040 --> 03:54:47,469
think it also generates influence beyond
what capital can do and

12022
03:54:47,469 --> 03:54:47,479
what capital can do and
 

12023
03:54:47,479 --> 03:54:53,910
what capital can do and
so do we want to have some groups D

12024
03:54:53,910 --> 03:54:53,920
so do we want to have some groups D
 

12025
03:54:53,920 --> 03:54:56,349
so do we want to have some groups D
utilizing that type of tech to direct

12026
03:54:56,349 --> 03:54:56,359
utilizing that type of tech to direct
 

12027
03:54:56,359 --> 03:54:58,389
utilizing that type of tech to direct
other people's attention if

12028
03:54:58,389 --> 03:54:58,399
other people's attention if
 

12029
03:54:58,399 --> 03:55:00,510
other people's attention if
so

12030
03:55:00,510 --> 03:55:00,520
so
 

12031
03:55:00,520 --> 03:55:04,149
so
um towards what towards what metrics of

12032
03:55:04,149 --> 03:55:04,159
um towards what towards what metrics of
 

12033
03:55:04,159 --> 03:55:05,950
um towards what towards what metrics of
what a good civilization and good human

12034
03:55:05,950 --> 03:55:05,960
what a good civilization and good human
 

12035
03:55:05,960 --> 03:55:08,110
what a good civilization and good human
life would be what's the oversight

12036
03:55:08,110 --> 03:55:08,120
life would be what's the oversight
 

12037
03:55:08,120 --> 03:55:11,229
life would be what's the oversight
process what is the transparency I can I

12038
03:55:11,229 --> 03:55:11,239
process what is the transparency I can I
 

12039
03:55:11,239 --> 03:55:13,149
process what is the transparency I can I
can can answer all the things you're

12040
03:55:13,149 --> 03:55:13,159
can can answer all the things you're
 

12041
03:55:13,159 --> 03:55:16,110
can can answer all the things you're
mentioning uh I I can build I I

12042
03:55:16,110 --> 03:55:16,120
mentioning uh I I can build I I
 

12043
03:55:16,120 --> 03:55:18,429
mentioning uh I I can build I I
guarantee you if I I'm not such a lazy

12044
03:55:18,429 --> 03:55:18,439
guarantee you if I I'm not such a lazy
 

12045
03:55:18,439 --> 03:55:20,710
guarantee you if I I'm not such a lazy
ass uh I'll be part of the many people

12046
03:55:20,710 --> 03:55:20,720
ass uh I'll be part of the many people
 

12047
03:55:20,720 --> 03:55:24,429
ass uh I'll be part of the many people
doing this is transparency and control

12048
03:55:24,429 --> 03:55:24,439
doing this is transparency and control
 

12049
03:55:24,439 --> 03:55:26,309
doing this is transparency and control
to giving control to individual people

12050
03:55:26,309 --> 03:55:26,319
to giving control to individual people
 

12051
03:55:26,319 --> 03:55:27,950
to giving control to individual people
okay so

12052
03:55:27,950 --> 03:55:27,960
okay so
 

12053
03:55:27,960 --> 03:55:30,710
okay so
maybe the

12054
03:55:30,710 --> 03:55:30,720
maybe the
 

12055
03:55:30,720 --> 03:55:33,790
maybe the
corporation has coordination on its

12056
03:55:33,790 --> 03:55:33,800
corporation has coordination on its
 

12057
03:55:33,800 --> 03:55:36,670
corporation has coordination on its
goals that all of its customers or users

12058
03:55:36,670 --> 03:55:36,680
goals that all of its customers or users
 

12059
03:55:36,680 --> 03:55:38,110
goals that all of its customers or users
together don't have so there's some

12060
03:55:38,110 --> 03:55:38,120
together don't have so there's some
 

12061
03:55:38,120 --> 03:55:39,990
together don't have so there's some
asymmetry where

12062
03:55:39,990 --> 03:55:40,000
asymmetry where
 

12063
03:55:40,000 --> 03:55:42,870
asymmetry where
it's uh a symmetry of its goals but

12064
03:55:42,870 --> 03:55:42,880
it's uh a symmetry of its goals but
 

12065
03:55:42,880 --> 03:55:45,070
it's uh a symmetry of its goals but
maybe I could actually help all of the

12066
03:55:45,070 --> 03:55:45,080
maybe I could actually help all of the
 

12067
03:55:45,080 --> 03:55:47,950
maybe I could actually help all of the
customers to coordinate almost like a

12068
03:55:47,950 --> 03:55:47,960
customers to coordinate almost like a
 

12069
03:55:47,960 --> 03:55:49,670
customers to coordinate almost like a
labor union or whatever by informing and

12070
03:55:49,670 --> 03:55:49,680
labor union or whatever by informing and
 

12071
03:55:49,680 --> 03:55:52,710
labor union or whatever by informing and
educating them adequately about the

12072
03:55:52,710 --> 03:55:52,720
educating them adequately about the
 

12073
03:55:52,720 --> 03:55:54,950
educating them adequately about the
effects the externalities on them this

12074
03:55:54,950 --> 03:55:54,960
effects the externalities on them this
 

12075
03:55:54,960 --> 03:55:57,189
effects the externalities on them this
is not toxic waste going into the ocean

12076
03:55:57,189 --> 03:55:57,199
is not toxic waste going into the ocean
 

12077
03:55:57,199 --> 03:55:59,030
is not toxic waste going into the ocean
of the atmosphere it's their their minds

think the IDE
 

12087
03:56:10,680 --> 03:56:12,670
think the IDE
one way of saying what you're saying I

03:57:35,830 --> 03:57:35,840
well see what you're talking about is
 

12163
03:57:35,840 --> 03:57:38,070
well see what you're talking about is
the application of tech here broadcast

12164
03:57:38,070 --> 03:57:38,080
the application of tech here broadcast
 

12165

education of the people and maybe
 

12277
03:59:41,760 --> 03:59:43,630

the fourth estate that have happened so
 

12283
03:59:47,439 --> 03:59:49,429
the fourth estate that have happened so
that people can start self-organizing to

of my house that I'd walked by a million

12810
04:10:49,630 --> 04:10:49,640
of my house that I'd walked by a million
 

12811
04:10:49,640 --> 04:10:52,229
of my house that I'd walked by a million
times and never looked at like this and

12812
04:10:52,229 --> 04:10:52,239
times and never looked at like this and
 

12813
04:10:52,239 --> 04:10:55,670
times and never looked at like this and
it wasn't the dose of mushrooms where I

12814
04:10:55,670 --> 04:10:55,680
it wasn't the dose of mushrooms where I
 

12815
04:10:55,680 --> 04:10:57,670
it wasn't the dose of mushrooms where I
was hallucinating like where the tree

12816
04:10:57,670 --> 04:10:57,680
was hallucinating like where the tree
 

12817
04:10:57,680 --> 04:10:59,550
was hallucinating like where the tree
was purple yeah like the tree still

12818
04:10:59,550 --> 04:10:59,560
was purple yeah like the tree still
 

12819
04:10:59,560 --> 04:11:01,070
was purple yeah like the tree still
looked like if I had to describe it say

12820
04:11:01,070 --> 04:11:01,080
looked like if I had to describe it say
 

12821
04:11:01,080 --> 04:11:03,229
looked like if I had to describe it say
it's green it has leaves looks like this

12822
04:11:03,229 --> 04:11:03,239
it's green it has leaves looks like this
 

12823
04:11:03,239 --> 04:11:05,750
it's green it has leaves looks like this
but it was way [\h__\h] more beautiful

12824
04:11:05,750 --> 04:11:05,760
but it was way [\h__\h] more beautiful
 

12825
04:11:05,760 --> 04:11:08,550
but it was way [\h__\h] more beautiful
like like capturing than it normally was

12826
04:11:08,550 --> 04:11:08,560
like like capturing than it normally was
 

12827
04:11:08,560 --> 04:11:09,910
like like capturing than it normally was
I'm like why is it so beautiful if I

12828
04:11:09,910 --> 04:11:09,920
I'm like why is it so beautiful if I
 

12829
04:11:09,920 --> 04:11:12,149
I'm like why is it so beautiful if I
would describe it the same way and I

12830
04:11:12,149 --> 04:11:12,159
would describe it the same way and I
 

12831
04:11:12,159 --> 04:11:13,630
would describe it the same way and I
realize I had no thoughts taking me

12832
04:11:13,630 --> 04:11:13,640
realize I had no thoughts taking me
 

12833
04:11:13,640 --> 04:11:16,670
realize I had no thoughts taking me
anywhere else yeah like what it seemed

12834
04:11:16,670 --> 04:11:16,680
anywhere else yeah like what it seemed
 

12835
04:11:16,680 --> 04:11:18,030
anywhere else yeah like what it seemed
like the mushrooms were doing was just

12836
04:11:18,030 --> 04:11:18,040
like the mushrooms were doing was just
 

12837
04:11:18,040 --> 04:11:19,630
like the mushrooms were doing was just
actually shutting the narrative off that

12838
04:11:19,630 --> 04:11:19,640
actually shutting the narrative off that
 

12839
04:11:19,640 --> 04:11:21,030
actually shutting the narrative off that
would have me be distracted so I could

12840
04:11:21,030 --> 04:11:21,040
would have me be distracted so I could
 

12841
04:11:21,040 --> 04:11:23,189
would have me be distracted so I could
really see the tree and then I'm like

12842
04:11:23,189 --> 04:11:23,199
really see the tree and then I'm like
 

12843

really see the tree and then I'm like
[\h__\h] when I get off these mushrooms I'm

12844
04:11:24,469 --> 04:11:24,479
[\h__\h] when I get off these mushrooms I'm
 

12845
04:11:24,479 --> 04:11:26,229
[\h__\h] when I get off these mushrooms I'm
going to practice seeing the tree

12846
04:11:26,229 --> 04:11:26,239
going to practice seeing the tree
 

12847
04:11:26,239 --> 04:11:27,630
