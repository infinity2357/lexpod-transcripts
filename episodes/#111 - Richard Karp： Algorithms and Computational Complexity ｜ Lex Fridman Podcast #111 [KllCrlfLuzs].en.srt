for bad behavior and was wandering
 

259
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,510
for bad behavior and was wandering
through the corridors of his school

260

through the corridors of his school
 

261
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,710
through the corridors of his school
and came upon two older students

262
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
and came upon two older students
 

263
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,909
and came upon two older students
who were studying the problem of finding

the shortest distance between
 

267
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,110

two non-overlapping circles
 

269
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,189
two non-overlapping circles
and michael thought about it and said

270
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:49,199

 

271
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,870

you take the straight line between the

272
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:50,880
you take the straight line between the
 

273
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,469
you take the straight line between the
two centers

274
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:52,479
two centers
 

275
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,550
two centers
and the segment between the two circles

276
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:54,560
and the segment between the two circles
 

277
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,230
and the segment between the two circles
is the shortest

278
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,240
is the shortest
 

279
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,230
is the shortest
because a straight line is the shortest

280
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,240
because a straight line is the shortest
 

281
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,710
because a straight line is the shortest
distance between the two centers

282
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:00,720
distance between the two centers
 

283
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,270
distance between the two centers
and any other line connecting the

00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,280
and any other line connecting the
 

285
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,950
and any other line connecting the
circles would be

286
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:04,960
circles would be
 

287
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,110
circles would be
on a longer line and i thought

288
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,120
on a longer line and i thought
 

289
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,870
on a longer line and i thought
and he thought and i agreed that this

290
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:10,880
and he thought and i agreed that this
 

291
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,310
and he thought and i agreed that this
was just

292
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,320
was just
 

293
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,270
was just
elegant that pure reasoning could come

by taking the radius on each side

316
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:41,520
by taking the radius on each side
 

317
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,510
by taking the radius on each side
you get a segment with a path with three

318
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:45,520
you get a segment with a path with three
 

319
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,350
you get a segment with a path with three
edges which connects the two centers

edges which connects the two centers
 

321
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,590
edges which connects the two centers
and this has to be at least as long as

yeah wow yeah that is that's quite
quite simple so what what is it about

330
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,080
quite simple so what what is it about
 

331
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,309
quite simple so what what is it about
that elegance that

you just find uh compelling well just
that you could

336
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:06,800
that you could
 

337
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,990
that you could
establish a a fact

338
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,000
establish a a fact
 

339
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,469
establish a a fact
about geometry beyond dispute by pure

solving puzzles in plain geometry it was

346
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:23,680
solving puzzles in plain geometry it was
 

347
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,189
solving puzzles in plain geometry it was
much more fun

348
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,199
much more fun
 

349
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,510
much more fun
than the earlier mathematics courses

00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:27,520
than the earlier mathematics courses
 

351
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,590

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,990
which were mostly about
arithmetic operations and manipulating

three-dimensional vision you mean being

370
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:47,919
three-dimensional vision you mean being
 

371
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,350
three-dimensional vision you mean being
able to visualize three-dimensional

372
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
able to visualize three-dimensional
 

373
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:49,749

00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:57,440
surfaces hyperplanes and so on um
 

379
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,710
surfaces hyperplanes and so on um
so so there there i didn't have an

00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,720
so so there there i didn't have an
 

381
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,749
so so there there i didn't have an
intuition

382
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:01,759
intuition
 

383
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,950
intuition
but

384
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:04,960

 

385
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,629

for example the fact that the sum of the

386
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
for example the fact that the sum of the
 

387
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,710
for example the fact that the sum of the
angles of a triangle is 180 degrees

388
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
angles of a triangle is 180 degrees
 

389
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,350
angles of a triangle is 180 degrees
is proved convincingly

390
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360
is proved convincingly
 

391
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,790
is proved convincingly
um and it comes as a surprise that that

392
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:18,800
um and it comes as a surprise that that
 

393
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,670
um and it comes as a surprise that that
can be done

394
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:21,680

 

395
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,189

why is that surprising the the

396
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:25,199
why is that surprising the the
 

397
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,990
why is that surprising the the
well it is a surprising uh is a

398
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,000
well it is a surprising uh is a
 

399
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,350
well it is a surprising uh is a
surprising idea

400
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:29,360
surprising idea
 

401
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,430
surprising idea
i suppose uh why is that proved

402
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:31,440
i suppose uh why is that proved
 

403
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,350
i suppose uh why is that proved
difficult it's not

404
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:33,360
difficult it's not
 

405
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,189
difficult it's not
that's the point it's so easy and yet

406
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:35,199
that's the point it's so easy and yet
 

407
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,670
that's the point it's so easy and yet
it's so convincing

408
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
it's so convincing
 

409
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,510
it's so convincing
do you remember what is the proof that

410
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,520
do you remember what is the proof that
 

411
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,710
do you remember what is the proof that
it's um

412
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:40,720
it's um
 

413
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,150
it's um
as up to 180 uh you you

414
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,160
as up to 180 uh you you
 

415
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,309
as up to 180 uh you you
start at a corner and draw

416
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:48,319
start at a corner and draw
 

417
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,390
start at a corner and draw
a line um

418
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400

 

419
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,230

parallel to the opposite side

420
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:56,240
parallel to the opposite side
 

421
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:02,230
parallel to the opposite side
and that line sort of trisects the angle

422
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,240
and that line sort of trisects the angle
 

423
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,430
and that line sort of trisects the angle
between the other two sides

424
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:05,440
between the other two sides
 

425
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,869
between the other two sides
and uh you you get a

426
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:08,879
and uh you you get a
 

427
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,909
and uh you you get a
uh a half plane which has to add up to

428
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:11,919
uh a half plane which has to add up to
 

429
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,150
uh a half plane which has to add up to
180 degrees

430
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,160
180 degrees
 

431
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,270
180 degrees
and it consists in the angles by

432
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
and it consists in the angles by
 

433
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,710
and it consists in the angles by
by the equality of uh alternate

434
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:20,720
by the equality of uh alternate
 

435
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,070

your work with combinatorial algorithms
 

455
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,709
your work with combinatorial algorithms
has it had some kind of

geometry
 

467
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,509
geometry
particularly i think

468
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:57,519

 

469
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,310

i use tools like linear programming and

470
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,320
i use tools like linear programming and
 

471
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,949
i use tools like linear programming and
integer programming a lot and

472
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:02,959
integer programming a lot and
 

473
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,389
integer programming a lot and
but those require

474
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:06,399
but those require
 

475
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,350
but those require
high dimensional visualization and so i

476
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:09,360
high dimensional visualization and so i
 

477
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,470
high dimensional visualization and so i
tend to go by the

478
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:10,480
tend to go by the
 

479
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,990
tend to go by the
algebraic properties um right the

480
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,000
algebraic properties um right the
 

481
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,070
algebraic properties um right the
you you go by the algebra the linear

482
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,080
you you go by the algebra the linear
 

483
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,070
you you go by the algebra the linear
algebra and not by the

484
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,080
algebra and not by the
 

485
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,829
algebra and not by the
the visualization well the

486
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:19,839
the visualization well the
 

487
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,949
the visualization well the
interpretation in terms of

488
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:22,959
interpretation in terms of
 

489
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,870
interpretation in terms of
for example finding the highest point on

490
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:24,880
for example finding the highest point on
 

491
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,310
for example finding the highest point on
a polyhedron

492
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,320
a polyhedron

495
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,190
as in linear programming
is motivating but again

496
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:33,200
is motivating but again
 

497
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,230
is motivating but again
it i don't have the high dimensional

498
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,240
it i don't have the high dimensional
 

499
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,509
it i don't have the high dimensional
intuition

500
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519

501
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,269

that would particularly inform me so i

502
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:41,279
that would particularly inform me so i
 

503
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,630
that would particularly inform me so i
sort of deep lean on the algebra

504
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
sort of deep lean on the algebra
 

505
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,790
sort of deep lean on the algebra
so to linger on that point what kind of

506
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:46,800
so to linger on that point what kind of
 

507
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,790
so to linger on that point what kind of
visualization

508
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:48,800
visualization
 

509
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,590
visualization
do you like do you do when you're trying

510
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:51,600
do you like do you do when you're trying
 

511
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,190
do you like do you do when you're trying
to think about

512
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,200
to think about
 

513
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,269
to think about
we'll get to combinatorial algorithms

514
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:55,279
we'll get to combinatorial algorithms
 

515
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,190
we'll get to combinatorial algorithms
but just algorithms in general

516
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200
but just algorithms in general
 

517
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,110
but just algorithms in general
yeah what kind of what what's inside

518
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
yeah what kind of what what's inside
 

519
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,790
yeah what kind of what what's inside
your mind when you're thinking about

520
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:00,800
your mind when you're thinking about
 

521
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,990
your mind when you're thinking about
designing algorithms

522
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,000
designing algorithms
 

523
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,150
designing algorithms
or or even just tackling any any

524
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,160
or or even just tackling any any
 

525
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,430
or or even just tackling any any
mathematical problem

526
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:09,440

 

527
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,870

well i think that usually an algorithm

528
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:12,880
well i think that usually an algorithm
 

529
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,350
well i think that usually an algorithm
is uh involves a repetition of some

530
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:17,360
is uh involves a repetition of some
 

531
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,389
is uh involves a repetition of some
inner loop and

532
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399
inner loop and
 

533
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,910
inner loop and
and so i can sort of visualize the um

534
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:23,920
and so i can sort of visualize the um
 

535
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,110
and so i can sort of visualize the um
the distance from the desired solution

536
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,120
the distance from the desired solution
 

537
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,949
the distance from the desired solution
as iteratively reducing until you

538
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:30,959
as iteratively reducing until you
 

539
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,590
as iteratively reducing until you
finally hit the exact solution and try

540
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:33,600
finally hit the exact solution and try
 

541
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,509
finally hit the exact solution and try
to take steps that get you closer to the

542
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:35,519
to take steps that get you closer to the
 

543
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,150
to take steps that get you closer to the
try to

544
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,160
try to
 

545
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,790
try to
take steps that get closer and having

546
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:38,800
take steps that get closer and having
 

547
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,230
take steps that get closer and having
the certainty of

548
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,240
the certainty of
 

549
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,350
the certainty of
converging so it's it's racist

550
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:43,360
converging so it's it's racist
 

551
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,069
converging so it's it's racist
it's basically the mechanics of the

552
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
it's basically the mechanics of the
 

553
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,350
it's basically the mechanics of the
algorithm is often very simple

554
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:49,360
algorithm is often very simple
 

555
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,829
algorithm is often very simple
but especially when you're trying

556
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:51,839
but especially when you're trying
 

557
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,509
but especially when you're trying
something out on the computer so for

558
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:53,519
something out on the computer so for
 

559
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,230
something out on the computer so for
example

560
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,240

 

561
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,590

i did some work on the traveling

562
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,600
i did some work on the traveling
 

563
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,470
i did some work on the traveling
salesman problem and

564
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,480
salesman problem and
 

565
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,550
salesman problem and
i could see there was a particular

566
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:02,560
i could see there was a particular
 

567
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,750
i could see there was a particular
function that had to be

568
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:03,760
function that had to be
 

569
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,949
function that had to be
minimized and it was fascinating to see

570
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:06,959
minimized and it was fascinating to see
 

571
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,110
minimized and it was fascinating to see
the successive approaches to the minimum

572
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,120
the successive approaches to the minimum
 

573
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,910
the successive approaches to the minimum
to the optimum

574
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:11,920
to the optimum
 

575
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,269
to the optimum
you mean so first of all traveling

576
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
you mean so first of all traveling
 

577
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,790
you mean so first of all traveling
salesman problems where you have to

578
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:14,800
salesman problems where you have to
 

579
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,910
salesman problems where you have to
visit

580
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:15,920
visit
 

581
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,150
visit
uh every city without ever

582
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,160
uh every city without ever
 

583
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,710
uh every city without ever
the only ones yeah that's right find the

584
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:22,720
the only ones yeah that's right find the
 

585
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,990
the only ones yeah that's right find the
shortest path through

586
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,000
shortest path through
 

587
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,949
shortest path through
cities yeah uh which is sort of a

588
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:26,959
cities yeah uh which is sort of a
 

589
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,430
cities yeah uh which is sort of a
canonical standard a really nice problem

590
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:29,440
canonical standard a really nice problem
 

591
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,470
canonical standard a really nice problem
that's really hard

592
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:30,480
that's really hard
 

593
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,750
that's really hard
right exactly so can you say again

594
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:33,760
right exactly so can you say again
 

595
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,150
right exactly so can you say again
what was nice about the objective being

596
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,160
what was nice about the objective being
 

597
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,590
what was nice about the objective being
able to think about the objective

598
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:37,600
able to think about the objective
 

599
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,630
able to think about the objective
function there and

600
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:38,640
function there and
 

601
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,069
function there and
maximizing it or minimizing it well just

602
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,079
maximizing it or minimizing it well just
 

603
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,150
maximizing it or minimizing it well just
that the um as the algorithm proceeded

604
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,160
that the um as the algorithm proceeded
 

605
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,150
that the um as the algorithm proceeded
it was you were making progress

606
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,160
it was you were making progress
 

607
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,670
it was you were making progress
continual progress

608
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680
continual progress
 

609
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,629
continual progress
and and eventually getting to the

610
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:52,639
and and eventually getting to the
 

611
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,829
and and eventually getting to the
optimum point

612
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:53,839
optimum point
 

613
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,030
optimum point
so there's two two parts maybe

614
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,040
so there's two two parts maybe
 

615
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,790
so there's two two parts maybe
maybe you can correct me but first is

616
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:58,800
maybe you can correct me but first is
 

617
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,870
maybe you can correct me but first is
like getting an intuition about what the

618
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:00,880
like getting an intuition about what the
 

619
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,790
like getting an intuition about what the
solution would look like

620
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:02,800
solution would look like
 

621
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,949
solution would look like
and or even maybe coming up with a

622
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:04,959
and or even maybe coming up with a
 

623
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,949
and or even maybe coming up with a
solution and two is proving that this

624
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:06,959
solution and two is proving that this
 

625
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:07,990
solution and two is proving that this
thing is

626
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
thing is
 

627
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,269
thing is
actually going to be pretty good uh what

628
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:11,279
actually going to be pretty good uh what
 

629
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,470
actually going to be pretty good uh what
part is harder for you where's the magic

630
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:14,480
part is harder for you where's the magic

so don calls these folks geeks and you

682
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:16,800
so don calls these folks geeks and you
 

683
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,629
so don calls these folks geeks and you
write that you remember the moment you

684
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
write that you remember the moment you
 

685
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,550
write that you remember the moment you
realized you were such a person

you were shown the hungarian algorithm

688
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,040
you were shown the hungarian algorithm
 

689
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,949
you were shown the hungarian algorithm
to solve the assignment problem

690
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:24,959
to solve the assignment problem
 

691
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,670
to solve the assignment problem
right so perhaps you can explain what

692
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:27,680
right so perhaps you can explain what
 

693
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,509
right so perhaps you can explain what
the assignment problem is and what

694
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:29,519
the assignment problem is and what
 

695
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,110
the assignment problem is and what
uh the hungarian algorithm is

696
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:33,120
uh the hungarian algorithm is
 

697
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,269
uh the hungarian algorithm is
so in the assignment problem you have uh

698
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:37,279
so in the assignment problem you have uh
 

699
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,949

you're given a matrix of numbers

710
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:55,600
you're given a matrix of numbers
 

711
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,110
you're given a matrix of numbers
and you want to find the

00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,120
and you want to find the
 

713
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,870

one-to-one matching of the boys with the
 

715
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,230
one-to-one matching of the boys with the
girls

716
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,240

such that the some of the associated
 

719
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,750
such that the some of the associated
costs will be

720
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:07,760
costs will be
 

721
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,110
costs will be
minimized so the the best way

722
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120
minimized so the the best way
 

723
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,069
minimized so the the best way
to match the boys with the girls or men

724
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:14,079
to match the boys with the girls or men
 

725
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,590
to match the boys with the girls or men
with jobs or any

726
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:15,600
with jobs or any
 

727
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,750
with jobs or any
two sets um no any possible matching is

728
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:19,760
two sets um no any possible matching is
 

729
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,470
two sets um no any possible matching is
possible

730
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:20,480
possible
 

731
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,910
possible
or yeah all one-to-one correspondences

732
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:23,920
or yeah all one-to-one correspondences
 

733
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,350
or yeah all one-to-one correspondences
are

734
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:25,360
are
 

735
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,910
are
permissible if there is a connection

736
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:27,920
permissible if there is a connection
 

737
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,350
permissible if there is a connection
that is not allowed

738
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:29,360
that is not allowed
 

739
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,949
that is not allowed
then you can think of it as having an

740
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:30,959
then you can think of it as having an
 

741
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,310
then you can think of it as having an
infinite cost

742
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:34,320

 

743
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,750

so um what you do is

744
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:37,760
so um what you do is
 

745
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,790
so um what you do is
uh to depend on

746
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:40,800
uh to depend on
 

747
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,990
uh to depend on
the observation that

748
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,000
the observation that
 

749
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,389
the observation that
the identity of the optimal

750
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:48,399
the identity of the optimal
 

751
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,829
the identity of the optimal
assignment or as we call it the optimal

752
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:51,839
assignment or as we call it the optimal
 

753
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,910
assignment or as we call it the optimal
permutation

754
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:53,920
permutation
 

755
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:00,230
permutation
um is not changed if you subtract

756
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:00,240

 

757
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,430

a constant from any row or column of the

758
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:03,440
a constant from any row or column of the
 

759
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,790
a constant from any row or column of the
matrix

760
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:04,800
matrix
 

761
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,030
matrix
you can see that the comparison between

762
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,040
you can see that the comparison between
 

763
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,949
you can see that the comparison between
the different assignments is not changed

764
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:08,959
the different assignments is not changed
 

765
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,870
the different assignments is not changed
by that

766
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:10,880
by that
 

767
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,150
by that
um because you're penal if you decrease

768
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,160
um because you're penal if you decrease
 

769
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,430
um because you're penal if you decrease
a particular row

770
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:15,440
a particular row
 

771
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,269
a particular row
all the elements of a row by some

772
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:17,279
all the elements of a row by some
 

773
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,629
all the elements of a row by some
constant

774
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:18,639
constant
 

775
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,189
constant
all solutions decrease by the cost of

776
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:21,199
all solutions decrease by the cost of
 

777
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:21,750
all solutions decrease by the cost of
that

778
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:21,760
that
 

779
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,110
that
by an amount equal to that constant

780
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,120
by an amount equal to that constant
 

781
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,350
by an amount equal to that constant
so the idea of the algorithm is to start

782
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:27,360
so the idea of the algorithm is to start
 

783
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,790
so the idea of the algorithm is to start
with a matrix of

784
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:28,800
with a matrix of
 

785
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,350
with a matrix of
non-negative numbers and

786
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,360
non-negative numbers and
 

787
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,629
non-negative numbers and
keep subtracting from rows or from

788
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:36,639
keep subtracting from rows or from
 

789
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,269
keep subtracting from rows or from
our entire columns um

790
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:41,279
our entire columns um
 

791
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,230
our entire columns um
in such a way that you subtract the same

792
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,240
in such a way that you subtract the same
 

793
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,990
in such a way that you subtract the same
constant from all the elements of that

794
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,000
constant from all the elements of that
 

795
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,910
constant from all the elements of that
row or column

796
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:47,920
row or column
 

797
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,829

uh while maintaining the property that

798
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:52,839
uh while maintaining the property that
 

799
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,710
uh while maintaining the property that
um uh

800
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:54,720
um uh
 

801
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,389
um uh
all the elements are non-negative

802
00:15:58,389 --> 00:15:58,399

 

803
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,509

simple yeah and so and so

804
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:01,519
simple yeah and so and so
 

805
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,710
simple yeah and so and so
um what you have to do

806
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:04,720
um what you have to do
 

807
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,470
um what you have to do
is uh is find

808
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:08,480
is uh is find
 

809
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,030
is uh is find
small moves which will decrease the

810
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,040
small moves which will decrease the
 

811
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,350
small moves which will decrease the
total cost

812
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:13,360
total cost
 

813
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,629
total cost
while subtracting constants from rows

814
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:16,639
while subtracting constants from rows
 

815
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,710
while subtracting constants from rows
or columns and there's a particular way

816
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:18,720
or columns and there's a particular way
 

817
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,189
or columns and there's a particular way
of doing that by computing a kind of

818
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:21,199
of doing that by computing a kind of
 

819
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,949
of doing that by computing a kind of
shortest path through the elements in

820
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:22,959
shortest path through the elements in
 

821
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,430
shortest path through the elements in
the matrix

822
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:25,440
the matrix
 

823
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,749
the matrix
and you just keep going in this way

824
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:29,759
and you just keep going in this way
 

825
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,470
and you just keep going in this way
until you finally get a full permutation

826
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:32,480
until you finally get a full permutation
 

827
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,150
until you finally get a full permutation
of zeros while the matrix is

828
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,160
of zeros while the matrix is
 

829
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,829
of zeros while the matrix is
non-negative and then you know that that

830
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:35,839
non-negative and then you know that that
 

831
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,470
non-negative and then you know that that
has to be the cheapest

832
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:38,480
has to be the cheapest
 

833
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,470
has to be the cheapest
is that as simple as it sounds

834
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,480
is that as simple as it sounds
 

835
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,790
is that as simple as it sounds
so the the shortest path of the matrix

836
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:44,800
so the the shortest path of the matrix
 

837
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,509
so the the shortest path of the matrix
part

838
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:45,519
part
 

839
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,509
part
yeah the simplicity lies in how you find

840
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:49,519
yeah the simplicity lies in how you find
 

841
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,230
yeah the simplicity lies in how you find
the what i oversimplified slightly what

842
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:52,240

843
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,269
the what i oversimplified slightly what
you

844
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:53,279
you
 

845
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,910
you
you you will end up subtracting a

846
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:55,920
you you will end up subtracting a
 

847
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,230
you you will end up subtracting a
constant from some rows

848
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,240
constant from some rows
 

849
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,269
constant from some rows
or columns and adding the same constant

850
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:01,279
or columns and adding the same constant
 

851
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,069
or columns and adding the same constant
back to other rows and columns

852
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:04,079
back to other rows and columns
 

853
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,150
back to other rows and columns
so as not to not to reduce any of the

854
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:08,160
so as not to not to reduce any of the
 

855
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,630
so as not to not to reduce any of the
zero

856
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:08,640
zero
 

857
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,949
zero
elements you leave them unchanged

858
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:12,959

 

859
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,150

but

860
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,160

 

861
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,029

each individual step modifies us

862
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:21,039
each individual step modifies us
 

863
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,949
each individual step modifies us
several rows and columns by the same

864
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:22,959
several rows and columns by the same
 

865
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,309
several rows and columns by the same
amount but

866
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:24,319
amount but
 

867
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,870
amount but
overall decreases the cost so there's

868
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:26,880
overall decreases the cost so there's
 

869
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,630
overall decreases the cost so there's
something about

870
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:28,640

profoundly interesting to people
 

1021
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,190
profoundly interesting to people
about math the the beauty of it

amazing things you can
 

1057
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,390
amazing things you can

you can uh um

1060
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:07,760
you can uh um
 

1061
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,630
you can uh um
you can solve little puzzles about

1062
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:10,640
you can solve little puzzles about
 

1063
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,350
you can solve little puzzles about
cannibals and missionaries

1064

cannibals and missionaries
 

1065
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,630
cannibals and missionaries
and there's a kind of achievement it's

1066
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:16,640
and there's a kind of achievement it's
 

1067
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,270
and there's a kind of achievement it's
it's it's

it's it's
 

1069
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,870
it's it's
puzzle solving and at a higher level the

1070
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:20,880
puzzle solving and at a higher level the
 

1071
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,149
puzzle solving and at a higher level the
fact that you can

1072
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:22,159
fact that you can
 

1073
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,070
fact that you can
you can do this reasoning that you can

1074
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:24,080
you can do this reasoning that you can
 

1075
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,270
you can do this reasoning that you can
prove in an

prove in an
 

1077
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,750
prove in an
absolutely ironclad way that the some of

1078
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:27,760
absolutely ironclad way that the some of
 

1079
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,390
absolutely ironclad way that the some of
the

1080
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:28,400
the
 

1081
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,630
the

1083
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,710
angles of a triangle is 180 degrees
yeah it's a nice escape from the

1084
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:34,720
yeah it's a nice escape from the
 

1085
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,149
yeah it's a nice escape from the
messiness of the real world

1086
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:36,159
messiness of the real world
 

1087
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,350
messiness of the real world
where nothing can be proved so and we'll

1088
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:39,360
where nothing can be proved so and we'll
 

1089
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,230
where nothing can be proved so and we'll
talk about it but

1090
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:40,240
talk about it but
 

1091
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,070
talk about it but
sometimes the ability to map the real

1092
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,080
sometimes the ability to map the real
 

1093
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,990
sometimes the ability to map the real
world into such problems where you can't

1094
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:44,000
world into such problems where you can't
 

1095
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,029
world into such problems where you can't
prove it is this a is a powerful step

1096
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:47,039
prove it is this a is a powerful step
 

1097
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,549
prove it is this a is a powerful step
yeah it's amazing that we can do this

1098
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:48,559
yeah it's amazing that we can do this
 

1099
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,470
yeah it's amazing that we can do this
another attribute of geeks is they

another attribute of geeks is they
 

1101
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,830
another attribute of geeks is they
they're not necessarily uh endowed with

00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:23,679
a 2000
 

1175
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,110
a 2000
univac with 2000 words of storage

1176
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,120
univac with 2000 words of storage
 

1177
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,070
univac with 2000 words of storage
and so you had to work hard to allocate

1178
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:30,080
and so you had to work hard to allocate
 

1179
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,710
and so you had to work hard to allocate
the memory properly to

1180
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:32,720
the memory properly to
 

1181
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,590
the memory properly to
also the excess time from one word to

1182
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:35,600
also the excess time from one word to
 

1183
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:35,990
also the excess time from one word to
another

1184
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,000
another
 

1185
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,510
another
depended on the number of

00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:39,520
depended on the number of
 

1187
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,149
depended on the number of
the particular words and so you there

1188
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:42,159
the particular words and so you there
 

1189
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:42,549
the particular words and so you there
was an

1190
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:42,559
was an
 

1191
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,510
was an
art to sort of arranging the storage

1192
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:45,520
art to sort of arranging the storage
 

1193
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,830

00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,000
were you attracted to this actual
 

1199
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,549
were you attracted to this actual
physical world implementation

1200

physical world implementation
 

1201
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,110
physical world implementation
of mathematics so it's a mathematical

1202
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,120
of mathematics so it's a mathematical
 

1203
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,909
of mathematics so it's a mathematical
machine that's

machine that's
 

1205

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,630
actually doing the math physically
no not at all i think i was a

algorithms
 

1213
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,750
algorithms
so but did you draw any inspiration so

1214
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:13,760
so but did you draw any inspiration so
 

1215
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,470
so but did you draw any inspiration so
could you have imagined like what did

1216
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:16,480
could you have imagined like what did
 

1217
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,630
could you have imagined like what did
you imagine was the future of these

1218
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:18,640
you imagine was the future of these
 

1219
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,029
you imagine was the future of these
giant computers could you imagine that

1220
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:21,039
giant computers could you imagine that
 

1221
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,870
giant computers could you imagine that
60 years later would have billions of

00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:22,880
60 years later would have billions of

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,149
60 years later would have billions of

these computers
 

1225
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,630
these computers
all over the world i couldn't imagine

1226
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:26,640
all over the world i couldn't imagine
 

1227
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,909
all over the world i couldn't imagine
that

1228
00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:27,919
that
 

1229
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,110
that
but there was a sense in the

1230
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:31,120
but there was a sense in the
 

1231
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,549
but there was a sense in the
laboratory that this was the wave of the

1232
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:34,559
laboratory that this was the wave of the
 

1233
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:35,909

in fact my mother influenced me she she

1236
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:39,039
in fact my mother influenced me she she
 

1237
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:39,909
in fact my mother influenced me she she
told me that

1238
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:39,919
told me that
 

1239
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,909
told me that
data processing was going to be really

1240
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:41,919
data processing was going to be really
 

1241
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,990
data processing was going to be really
big and i should get into it

1242
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,000
big and i should get into it
 

1243
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,470
big and i should get into it
she's a smart woman yeah she was a smart

1244
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:48,480
she's a smart woman yeah she was a smart
 

1245
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,029
she's a smart woman yeah she was a smart
woman

1246
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:49,039
woman
 

1247
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,230
woman
and there was just a feeling that

1248
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:52,240
and there was just a feeling that
 

1249
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,390
and there was just a feeling that
this was going to change the world but i

1250
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:54,400
this was going to change the world but i
 

1251
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,149
this was going to change the world but i
i didn't think of it in terms of

1252
00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:56,159
i didn't think of it in terms of
 

1253
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,669
i didn't think of it in terms of
personal computing i hadn't that

1254
00:24:57,669 --> 00:24:57,679
personal computing i hadn't that
 

1255
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,990
personal computing i hadn't that
i had no anticipation that we would be

1256
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,000
i had no anticipation that we would be
 

1257
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,750
i had no anticipation that we would be
walking around with computers in our

1258
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:03,760
walking around with computers in our
 

1259
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,149
walking around with computers in our
pockets or anything like that

1260
00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:06,159
pockets or anything like that
 

1261
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,590
pockets or anything like that
did you see computers as

1262
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:09,600
did you see computers as
 

1263
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,029
did you see computers as
tools as mathematical mechanisms to

1264
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:13,039
tools as mathematical mechanisms to
 

1265
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,789
tools as mathematical mechanisms to
analyze sort of

1266
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:14,799
analyze sort of
 

1267
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,630
analyze sort of
sort of theoretical computer science or

1268
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:16,640
sort of theoretical computer science or
 

1269
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,669
sort of theoretical computer science or
as the ai folks which is an entire

1270
00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:19,679
as the ai folks which is an entire
 

1271
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,870
as the ai folks which is an entire
other community of dreamers yeah that's

1272
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:22,880
other community of dreamers yeah that's
 

1273
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,990
other community of dreamers yeah that's
something that could

1274
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,000
something that could
 

1275
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,710
something that could
one day have human level intelligence

1276
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:26,720
one day have human level intelligence
 

1277
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,990
one day have human level intelligence
well ai wasn't very

1278
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,000
well ai wasn't very
 

1279
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,669
well ai wasn't very
much on my radar i did read uh turing's

1280
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:31,679
much on my radar i did read uh turing's
 

1281
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,950
much on my radar i did read uh turing's
paper about the uh the uh

1282
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:34,960
paper about the uh the uh
 

1283
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,110
paper about the uh the uh
the uh the drawing test computing and

1284
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:37,120
the uh the drawing test computing and
 

1285
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,990
the uh the drawing test computing and
intelligence

1286
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,000
intelligence
 

1287
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,870
intelligence
yeah the turing test um what'd you think

1288
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:40,880
yeah the turing test um what'd you think
 

1289
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,470
yeah the turing test um what'd you think
about that paper was that just like

1290
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:42,480
about that paper was that just like
 

1291
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,630
about that paper was that just like
science fiction

1292
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:44,640
science fiction
 

1293
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,830
science fiction
um i thought that it wasn't a very good

1294
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:47,840
um i thought that it wasn't a very good
 

1295
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,789
um i thought that it wasn't a very good
test because it was too subjective so i

1296
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:50,799
test because it was too subjective so i
 

1297
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,990
test because it was too subjective so i
i didn't

1298
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:52,000
i didn't
 

1299
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,870
i didn't
feel that i didn't feel that the turing

1300
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:54,880
feel that i didn't feel that the turing
 

1301
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,669
feel that i didn't feel that the turing
test was really the right way to

1302
00:25:57,669 --> 00:25:57,679
test was really the right way to
 

1303
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,230
test was really the right way to
calibrate how intelligent an algorithm

1304
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:00,240
calibrate how intelligent an algorithm
 

1305
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:00,950
calibrate how intelligent an algorithm
could be

1306
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:00,960
could be
 

1307
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,110
could be
to linger on that do you think it's pos

1308
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,120
to linger on that do you think it's pos
 

1309
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,470
to linger on that do you think it's pos
because you've come up with some

1310
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:04,480
because you've come up with some
 

1311
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,669
because you've come up with some
incredible

1312
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:05,679
incredible
 

1313
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,110
incredible
tests later on tests on algorithms right

1314
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,120
tests later on tests on algorithms right
 

1315
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,190
tests later on tests on algorithms right
yeah that are

1316
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:11,200
yeah that are
 

1317
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,149
yeah that are
like strong reliable robust across a

1318
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:14,159
like strong reliable robust across a
 

1319
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,470
like strong reliable robust across a
bunch of different classes of algorithms

1320
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:16,480
bunch of different classes of algorithms
 

1321
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,590
bunch of different classes of algorithms
but returning to this emotional

1322
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:19,600
but returning to this emotional
 

1323
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,669
but returning to this emotional
mess that is intelligence do you think

1324
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:21,679
mess that is intelligence do you think
 

1325
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:22,710
mess that is intelligence do you think
it's possible

1326
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:22,720
it's possible
 

1327
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,510
it's possible
to come up with the test that's as

1328
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:25,520
to come up with the test that's as
 

1329
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,269
to come up with the test that's as
iron-clad as

1330
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:27,279
iron-clad as
 

1331
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,669
iron-clad as
some of the computational complexity

1332
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:29,679
some of the computational complexity
 

1333
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,190
some of the computational complexity
work

1334
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:31,200
work
 

1335
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,789
work
well i think the greater question is

1336
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:32,799
well i think the greater question is
 

1337
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,269
well i think the greater question is
whether it's possible to achieve

1338
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:35,279
whether it's possible to achieve
 

1339
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,630
whether it's possible to achieve
human level level intelligence

1340
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:38,640
human level level intelligence
 

1341
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,549
human level level intelligence
right so that's so first of all let me

1342
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:40,559
right so that's so first of all let me
 

1343
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,789
right so that's so first of all let me
at the philosophical level do you think

1344
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:42,799
at the philosophical level do you think
 

1345
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,310
at the philosophical level do you think
it's possible to create algorithms

1346
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:46,320
it's possible to create algorithms
 

1347
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,510
it's possible to create algorithms
that reason and

1348
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:49,520
that reason and
 

1349
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,310
that reason and
would seem to us to have the same kind

1350
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:52,320
would seem to us to have the same kind
 

1351
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,110
would seem to us to have the same kind
of intelligence as human beings

1352
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,120
of intelligence as human beings
 

1353
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,909
of intelligence as human beings
it's an open question um it seems to me

1354
00:26:59,909 --> 00:26:59,919
it's an open question um it seems to me
 

1355
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:07,029
it's an open question um it seems to me
that um most of the achievements have

1356
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:07,039

00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:13,039

1504
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:14,480
the fact that we have this subjective
 

1505
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,789
the fact that we have this subjective
experience right is it possible that

1506
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:16,799
experience right is it possible that
 

1507
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:17,990
experience right is it possible that
this

1508
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,000
this
 

1509
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,830
this
network of uh this circuit of switches

1510
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:21,840
network of uh this circuit of switches
 

1511
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,350
network of uh this circuit of switches
is able to create something like

1512
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:23,360
is able to create something like
 

1513
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,710
is able to create something like
consciousness to know its own identity

1514
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:26,720
consciousness to know its own identity
 

1515
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,029
consciousness to know its own identity
yeah to know to know the algorithm to

1516
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:29,039
yeah to know to know the algorithm to
 

1517
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,149
yeah to know to know the algorithm to
know itself

1518
00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:30,159
know itself
 

1519
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,190
know itself
to know itself i think if you try to

1520
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:33,200
to know itself i think if you try to
 

1521
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,549
to know itself i think if you try to
define that

1522
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:34,559
define that
 

1523
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,470
define that
rigorously you'd have a lot of trouble

1524
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:36,480
rigorously you'd have a lot of trouble
 

1525
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,350
rigorously you'd have a lot of trouble
yeah that's interesting

1526
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:39,360
yeah that's interesting
 

1527
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,549
yeah that's interesting
so i know that there are

1528
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:42,559
so i know that there are
 

1529
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,389
so i know that there are
many who um

1530
00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:46,399
many who um
 

1531
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,430
many who um
believe that general

1532
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:49,440
believe that general
 

1533
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,789
believe that general
intelligence can be achieved and there

1534
00:30:52,789 --> 00:30:52,799
intelligence can be achieved and there
 

1535
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,310
intelligence can be achieved and there
are even some who are

1536
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:54,320
are even some who are
 

1537
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,590
are even some who are
feel certain that uh

1538
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:57,600
feel certain that uh
 

1539
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,149
feel certain that uh
the singularity will come and uh we will

1540
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:00,159
the singularity will come and uh we will
 

1541
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,070
the singularity will come and uh we will
be surpassed by the machines which will

1542
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:02,080
be surpassed by the machines which will
 

1543
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,389
be surpassed by the machines which will
then

1544
00:31:02,389 --> 00:31:02,399
then
 

1545
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,350
then
learn more and more about themselves and

1546
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:05,360
learn more and more about themselves and
 

1547
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,470
learn more and more about themselves and
reduce humans to an inferior breed

1548
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:08,480
reduce humans to an inferior breed
 

1549
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,710
reduce humans to an inferior breed
i am doubtful that this will ever be

1550
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:10,720
i am doubtful that this will ever be
 

1551
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,630
i am doubtful that this will ever be
achieved

1552
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:12,640

doubtful so there are
 

1561
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,750
doubtful so there are
quite a few people that are extremely

that's not quite

that's not quite
 

1575
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,830
that's not quite

what do you think about ideas as a sort

00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,669
what do you think about ideas as a sort
of uh if we look at moore's law

00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:06,720
and exponential improvement uh to allow
 

1599
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,430
and exponential improvement uh to allow
us to

us to
 

1601
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,750
us to
that would surprise us sort of our

1602
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:09,760
that would surprise us sort of our

exponential improvement
 

1607
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,909
exponential improvement
because i mean we're not able to kind of

1608
00:32:15,909 --> 00:32:15,919
because i mean we're not able to kind of
 

1609
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,909
because i mean we're not able to kind of
we kind of think in linear improvement

1610
00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:17,919
we kind of think in linear improvement
 

1611
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,070
we kind of think in linear improvement
yeah we're not able to imagine a world

1612
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:20,080
yeah we're not able to imagine a world
 

1613
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,909
yeah we're not able to imagine a world
that goes from the

1614
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:21,919
that goes from the
 

1615

that goes from the

1617
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,430
mark one computer to a an iphone 10.
yeah so do you think it would be we

1618
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:29,440
yeah so do you think it would be we
 

1619
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,190
yeah so do you think it would be we
could be really surprised

1620
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:31,200
could be really surprised
 

1621
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,389
could be really surprised
by the exponential growth or

1622
00:32:34,389 --> 00:32:34,399
by the exponential growth or
 

1623
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,430
by the exponential growth or
or on the flip side is is it possible

1624
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:37,440
or on the flip side is is it possible
 

1625
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,029
or on the flip side is is it possible
that also intelligence is

1626
00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:39,039
that also intelligence is
 

1627
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,149
that also intelligence is
actually way way way way harder

1628
00:32:42,149 --> 00:32:42,159
actually way way way way harder
 

1629
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,269
actually way way way way harder
even with exponential improvement to be

1630
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:45,279
even with exponential improvement to be
 

1631
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,029
even with exponential improvement to be
able to crack

1632
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:47,039
able to crack
 

1633
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,029
able to crack
i don't think any constant factor

i don't think any constant factor
 

1635
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,230
i don't think any constant factor

of how the of

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,350
of how the of

of what cognition requires it seems to
 

1645
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,710

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,909
a factor of a thousand or a million
uh will not be useful until we really

what are combinatorial algorithms
 

1667
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,190
what are combinatorial algorithms
and what are some major examples of

you might want to find a
 

1837
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,430
you might want to find a
set of so-called gates switches

1838
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:09,440
set of so-called gates switches
 

1839
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,230
set of so-called gates switches
that perform logical functions which can

1840
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:12,240
that perform logical functions which can
 

1841
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,230
that perform logical functions which can
be interconnected to realize some

1842
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:14,240
be interconnected to realize some
 

1843
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,109
be interconnected to realize some
function

1844
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:15,119
function
 

1845
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:20,470
function
so you you might ask um

1846
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:20,480

 

1847
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,109

how many gates do you need in order to

1848
00:37:23,109 --> 00:37:23,119
how many gates do you need in order to
 

1849
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,150
how many gates do you need in order to
um

1850
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:26,160

 

1851
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,550

for for a circuit to

1852
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:30,560
for for a circuit to
 

1853
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,150
for for a circuit to
give a yes output if at least

1854
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:34,160
give a yes output if at least
 

1855
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,750
give a yes output if at least
a given number of its inputs are ones

1856
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:37,760
a given number of its inputs are ones
 

1857
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,109
a given number of its inputs are ones
and no if not a few are

1858
00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:41,119
and no if not a few are
 

1859
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,310
and no if not a few are
are present my favorite is probably

1860
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:44,320
are present my favorite is probably
 

1861
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,550
are present my favorite is probably
all the all the work with network flows

1862
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:46,560
all the all the work with network flows
 

1863
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,790
all the all the work with network flows
so anytime you have

1864
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:48,800
so anytime you have
 

1865
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,630
so anytime you have
uh i don't know why it's so compelling

1866
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:50,640
uh i don't know why it's so compelling
 

1867
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,990
uh i don't know why it's so compelling
but there's something just beautiful

1868
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:52,000
but there's something just beautiful
 

1869
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,430
but there's something just beautiful
about it it seems like there's so many

1870
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:53,440
about it it seems like there's so many
 

1871
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,430
about it it seems like there's so many
applications and communication networks

1872
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:57,440
applications and communication networks
 

1873
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,550
applications and communication networks
in uh traffic right flow

1874
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:00,560
in uh traffic right flow
 

1875
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,870
in uh traffic right flow
that you can map into these and then you

1876
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:02,880
that you can map into these and then you
 

1877
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,990
that you can map into these and then you
can think of pipes

1878
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,000
can think of pipes
 

1879
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,670
can think of pipes
and water going through pipes and you

1880
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:05,680
and water going through pipes and you
 

1881
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,109
and water going through pipes and you
could optimize it in different ways

1882
00:38:07,109 --> 00:38:07,119
could optimize it in different ways
 

1883
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:07,990
could optimize it in different ways
there's something

1884
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:08,000
there's something
 

1885
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,030
there's something
always visually and intellectually

1886
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:11,040
always visually and intellectually
 

1887
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,430
always visually and intellectually
compelling to me about it and of course

1888
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:13,440
compelling to me about it and of course
 

1889
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,510
compelling to me about it and of course
you've done work there

1890
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:15,520
you've done work there
 

1891
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,190
you've done work there
yeah yeah so so there

1892
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:19,200
yeah yeah so so there
 

1893
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,870
yeah yeah so so there

but so there is an algorithm

1978
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:03,440
but so there is an algorithm
 

1979
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,790
but so there is an algorithm
named after you an admins they haven't

what was it like tackling that problem

1984
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:12,480
what was it like tackling that problem
 

1985
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,309
what was it like tackling that problem
and trying to arrive at a polynomial

1986
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:14,319
and trying to arrive at a polynomial
 

1987
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:15,510
and trying to arrive at a polynomial

00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:17,040
and maybe you can describe the algorithm
 

1991
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,390
and maybe you can describe the algorithm
maybe you can describe what's the

1992
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:18,400
maybe you can describe what's the
 

1993
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,750
maybe you can describe what's the
running time complexity

1994
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:19,760
running time complexity
 

1995
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,790
running time complexity
that you showed yeah well

1996
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:22,800
that you showed yeah well
 

1997
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,630
that you showed yeah well
first of all what is a polynomial time

1998
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:24,640
first of all what is a polynomial time
 

1999
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,349
first of all what is a polynomial time
algorithm yeah perhaps we could

2000
00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:27,359

2001
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,910
algorithm yeah perhaps we could
discuss that so yeah let's let's

2002
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:29,920
discuss that so yeah let's let's
 

2003
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,870
discuss that so yeah let's let's
actually just even

00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:30,880
actually just even
 

2005
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,870
actually just even
yeah that's what is algorithmic

2006
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:32,880
yeah that's what is algorithmic
 

2007
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,470

2153
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,109
problem
yeah that's also true because especially

2154
00:43:33,109 --> 00:43:33,119
yeah that's also true because especially
 

2155
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,670
yeah that's also true because especially
as we get very large networks

2156

as we get very large networks
the size can be in the millions and uh

2158
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:38,720
the size can be in the millions and uh
 

2159
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,870
the size can be in the millions and uh
and then anything above uh

2160
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:42,880
and then anything above uh
 

2161
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,910
and then anything above uh
n log n where n is the size would be

2162
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:45,920
n log n where n is the size would be
 

2163
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,910
n log n where n is the size would be
uh too much for a practical solution

2164
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:49,920
uh too much for a practical solution
 

2165
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,589
uh too much for a practical solution
okay so that's polynomial time

2166
00:43:51,589 --> 00:43:51,599
okay so that's polynomial time
 

2167
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,829
okay so that's polynomial time

00:43:53,829 --> 00:43:53,839
algorithms what other classes of
 

2169
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,069
algorithms what other classes of
algorithms are there

2170
00:43:56,069 --> 00:43:56,079
algorithms are there
 

2171
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,510
algorithms are there
what's so that usually they they

2172
00:43:59,510 --> 00:43:59,520
what's so that usually they they
 

2173
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,309
what's so that usually they they
designate polynomials of the letter p

2174
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:02,319
designate polynomials of the letter p
 

2175
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:03,190
designate polynomials of the letter p
yeah there's also

2176
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:03,200
yeah there's also
 

2177
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:07,030
yeah there's also
np np complete and be hard yeah

2178
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:07,040
np np complete and be hard yeah
 

2179
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,030
np np complete and be hard yeah
so can you try to disentangle those and

2180
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:11,040
so can you try to disentangle those and
 

2181
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,390
so can you try to disentangle those and
by trying to define them simply

2182
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:14,400
by trying to define them simply
 

2183
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,030
by trying to define them simply
right so a polynomial time algorithm is

2184
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:17,040
right so a polynomial time algorithm is
 

2185
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,069
right so a polynomial time algorithm is
one which

2186
00:44:18,069 --> 00:44:18,079
one which
 

2187
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,550
one which
was running time is bounded by a

2188
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:20,560
was running time is bounded by a
 

2189
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,510
was running time is bounded by a
polynomial and the size of the input

2190
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:23,520
polynomial and the size of the input
 

2191
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,990
polynomial and the size of the input
uh there's then there's that the class

2192
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:26,000
uh there's then there's that the class
 

2193
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,589
uh there's then there's that the class
of such algorithms is

2194
00:44:27,589 --> 00:44:27,599
of such algorithms is
 

2195
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,550
of such algorithms is
called p in the worst case by the way we

2196
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:30,560
called p in the worst case by the way we
 

2197
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,109
called p in the worst case by the way we
should say

2198
00:44:31,109 --> 00:44:31,119
should say
 

2199
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,190
should say
right yeah for every case of the problem

2200
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:33,200
right yeah for every case of the problem
 

2201
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,270
right yeah for every case of the problem
and that's very important that

2202
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:35,280
and that's very important that
 

2203
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,790
and that's very important that
in this theory when we measure the

2204
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:38,800
in this theory when we measure the
 

2205
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,790
in this theory when we measure the
complexity of an algorithm

2206
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:40,800
complexity of an algorithm
 

2207
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,990
complexity of an algorithm
we really measure the

2208
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:44,000
we really measure the
 

2209
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,069
we really measure the
number of step the growth of the number

2210
00:44:46,069 --> 00:44:46,079
number of step the growth of the number
 

2211
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:47,270
number of step the growth of the number
of steps

2212
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:47,280
of steps
 

2213
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,589
of steps
in the worst case so you may have an

2214
00:44:49,589 --> 00:44:49,599
in the worst case so you may have an
 

2215
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,020
in the worst case so you may have an
algorithm that

2216
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:51,030
algorithm that
 

2217
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:52,230
algorithm that

00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,349
[Music]
runs very rapidly in most cases but if

2220
00:44:55,349 --> 00:44:55,359
runs very rapidly in most cases but if
 

2221
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:55,990
runs very rapidly in most cases but if
there is

2222
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:56,000
there is
 

2223
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,550
there is
any case where it gets into a very long

2224
00:44:58,550 --> 00:44:58,560
any case where it gets into a very long
 

2225
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,990
any case where it gets into a very long
computation

2226
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:00,000
computation
 

2227
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,710
computation
that would increase the computational

2228
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:02,720
that would increase the computational
 

2229
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,349
that would increase the computational
complexity by this measure

2230
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:05,359
complexity by this measure
 

2231
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,349
complexity by this measure
and that's a very important issue

2232
00:45:07,349 --> 00:45:07,359
and that's a very important issue
 

2233
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,030
and that's a very important issue
because there

2234
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:09,040
because there
 

2235
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,790
because there
as we may have discussed later there are

2236
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:10,800
as we may have discussed later there are
 

2237
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,510
as we may have discussed later there are
some very important algorithms which

2238
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:13,520
some very important algorithms which
 

2239
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,870
some very important algorithms which
don't have a good

would it take to verify that a solution

2306
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:40,000
would it take to verify that a solution
 

2307
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,750
would it take to verify that a solution
is optimal so for example

2308
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:43,760
is optimal so for example

00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,069
if if the input was a graph
we might want to find the largest

00:46:52,069 --> 00:46:52,079
we might want to find the largest
 

2313
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:55,030
we might want to find the largest
clique in the graph or a clique is a set

2314
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:55,040
clique in the graph or a clique is a set
 

2315
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,270
clique in the graph or a clique is a set
of vertices

2316
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:57,280
of vertices
 

2317
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,750
of vertices
such that any vertex each vertex in the

2318
00:46:59,750 --> 00:46:59,760
such that any vertex each vertex in the
 

2319
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,150
such that any vertex each vertex in the
set is adjacent

2320
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:02,160
set is adjacent
 

2321
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,270
set is adjacent
to each of the others so the

2322
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:05,280
to each of the others so the
 

2323
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,870
to each of the others so the
clique is a complete subgraph

2324
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:08,880
clique is a complete subgraph
 

2325
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,109
clique is a complete subgraph
yeah so if it's a facebook social

2326
00:47:11,109 --> 00:47:11,119
yeah so if it's a facebook social
 

2327
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,030
yeah so if it's a facebook social
network everybody's friends

2328
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:13,040
network everybody's friends
 

2329
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,430
network everybody's friends
with everybody else it's close click no

2330
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:15,440
with everybody else it's close click no
 

2331
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,870
with everybody else it's close click no
that would be what's called a complete

2332
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:16,880
that would be what's called a complete
 

2333
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,150
that would be what's called a complete
graph it would be

2334
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:18,160
graph it would be
 

2335
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,870
graph it would be
no i mean uh within that click uh within

2336
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:20,880
no i mean uh within that click uh within
 

2337
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,829
no i mean uh within that click uh within
that clique yeah

2338
00:47:22,829 --> 00:47:22,839
that clique yeah
 

2339
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:26,309
that clique yeah
yeah they're all friends so a complete

2340
00:47:26,309 --> 00:47:26,319
yeah they're all friends so a complete
 

2341
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:27,750
yeah they're all friends so a complete
graph is when

2342
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:27,760
graph is when
 

2343
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,510
graph is when
everybody is friendly as everybody is

2344
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:29,520
everybody is friendly as everybody is
 

2345
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,270
everybody is friendly as everybody is
friends with everybody yeah

2346
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:31,280
friends with everybody yeah
 

2347
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,430
friends with everybody yeah
so the problem might be to determine

2348
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:35,440
so the problem might be to determine
 

2349
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,710
so the problem might be to determine
whether in a given graph there exists a

2350
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:38,720
whether in a given graph there exists a
 

2351
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:39,510
whether in a given graph there exists a
clique

2352
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:39,520
clique
 

2353
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,870
clique
of a certain size

2354
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:42,880

 

2355
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,549

well that turns out to be a very hard

2356
00:47:44,549 --> 00:47:44,559
well that turns out to be a very hard
 

2357
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,470
well that turns out to be a very hard
problem but how

2358
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:46,480
problem but how
 

2359
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,510
problem but how
but if somebody hands you a clique and

2360
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:49,520
but if somebody hands you a clique and
 

2361
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,109
but if somebody hands you a clique and
asks you to check

2362
00:47:51,109 --> 00:47:51,119
asks you to check
 

2363
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,470
asks you to check
whether it is a hands you a set of

2364
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:54,480
whether it is a hands you a set of
 

2365
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,390
whether it is a hands you a set of
vertices and ask you to check whether

2366
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:56,400
vertices and ask you to check whether
 

2367
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,870
vertices and ask you to check whether
it's a clique

2368
00:47:58,870 --> 00:47:58,880
it's a clique
 

2369
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,510
it's a clique
you could do that simply by exhaustively

2370
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:01,520
you could do that simply by exhaustively
 

2371
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,349
you could do that simply by exhaustively
looking at all of the edges between the

2372
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:03,359
looking at all of the edges between the
 

2373
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,109
looking at all of the edges between the
vertices and the clique

2374
00:48:05,109 --> 00:48:05,119
vertices and the clique
 

2375
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,150
vertices and the clique
and verifying that they're all there and

2376
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:08,160
and verifying that they're all there and
 

2377
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,309
and verifying that they're all there and
that's a polynomial time

2378
00:48:10,309 --> 00:48:10,319
that's a polynomial time
 

2379
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:13,349
that's a polynomial time
that's a polynomial so the verify there

2380
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:13,359
that's a polynomial so the verify there
 

2381
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:17,589
that's a polynomial so the verify there
the problem of finding the clique

2382
00:48:17,589 --> 00:48:17,599

 

2383
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,510

appears to be extremely hard but the

2384
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:19,520
appears to be extremely hard but the
 

2385
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,870
appears to be extremely hard but the
problem of verifying a clique

2386
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:22,880
problem of verifying a clique
 

2387
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,790
problem of verifying a clique
to see if it reaches the target number

2388
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:24,800
to see if it reaches the target number
 

2389
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,230
to see if it reaches the target number
of vertices

2390
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:28,240
of vertices
 

2391
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,670
of vertices
is easy to solve is easy to verify

2392
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:31,680
is easy to solve is easy to verify
 

2393
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,549
is easy to solve is easy to verify
so finding the clique is hard checking

2394
00:48:34,549 --> 00:48:34,559
so finding the clique is hard checking
 

2395
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,670
so finding the clique is hard checking
it is easy

2396
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:35,680
it is easy
 

2397
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,990
it is easy
problems of that nature are called the

2398
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:39,000
problems of that nature are called the
 

2399
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,190
problems of that nature are called the
non-deterministic polynomial time

getting a yes no a yes or no answer
 

2413
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,390
getting a yes no a yes or no answer
rather than a numerical value so either

the question is whether p is equal to np
 

2501
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,670
the question is whether p is equal to np
if p were equal to np it would be

00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:45,680
if p were equal to np it would be
 

2503
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,750
if p were equal to np it would be
amazing it would mean

amazing it would mean
 

2505
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,870
amazing it would mean
that every

polynomial time we don't really believe
 

2513
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:03,349
polynomial time we don't really believe
that's true

2514
00:51:03,349 --> 00:51:03,359
that's true
 

2515
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:07,030
that's true
if you're scheduling classes at a school

2516
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:07,040
if you're scheduling classes at a school
 

2517
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:10,630
if you're scheduling classes at a school
it's we expect that if somebody hands

2518
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:10,640
it's we expect that if somebody hands
 

2519
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:10,870
it's we expect that if somebody hands
you

2520
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:10,880
you
 

2521
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,910
you
a satisfying schedule you can verify

2522
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:13,920
a satisfying schedule you can verify
 

2523
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,430
a satisfying schedule you can verify
that it works

2524
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:15,440
that it works
 

2525
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,870
that it works
that doesn't mean that you should be

2526
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:16,880
that doesn't mean that you should be
 

2527
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,870
that doesn't mean that you should be
able to find such a schedule

2528
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:18,880
able to find such a schedule
 

2529
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,069
able to find such a schedule
so intuitively np encompasses a lot more

2530
00:51:22,069 --> 00:51:22,079
so intuitively np encompasses a lot more
 

2531
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,430
so intuitively np encompasses a lot more
problems than p so can

2532
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:25,440
problems than p so can
 

2533
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,790
problems than p so can
we take a small tangent and break apart

2534
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:28,800
we take a small tangent and break apart
 

2535
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,309
we take a small tangent and break apart
that intuition

2536
00:51:30,309 --> 00:51:30,319
that intuition
 

2537
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:33,430
that intuition
so do you first of all think that

2538
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:33,440
so do you first of all think that
 

2539
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,349
so do you first of all think that
the biggest sort of open problem in

is whether p equals np do you think

2544
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:40,800
is whether p equals np do you think
 

2545
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,470
is whether p equals np do you think
p equals np or do you think p

2546
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:44,480
p equals np or do you think p
 

2547
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,030
p equals np or do you think p
is not equal to np if you had to bet all

00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:48,480
your money on it
 

2551
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,670

i would bet that p is unequal to np

2552
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:51,680
i would bet that p is unequal to np
 

2553
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,150
i would bet that p is unequal to np
uh simply because there are problems

2554
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:54,160
uh simply because there are problems
 

2555
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,990
uh simply because there are problems
that have been around for centuries and

factoring large numbers so uh

2580
00:52:25,589 --> 00:52:25,599
factoring large numbers so uh
 

2581
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:28,069
factoring large numbers so uh
we know what a number is prime if it

2582
00:52:28,069 --> 00:52:28,079
we know what a number is prime if it
 

2583
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:28,790
we know what a number is prime if it
doesn't

2584
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:28,800
doesn't
 

2585
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,349
doesn't
if it cannot be written as the product

2586
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:31,359
if it cannot be written as the product
 

2587
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:31,990
if it cannot be written as the product
of

2588
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:32,000
of
 

2589
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,990

two or more numbers unequal to one

2590
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:36,000
two or more numbers unequal to one
 

2591
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,510
two or more numbers unequal to one
uh so if we can factor the a number like

2592
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:39,520
uh so if we can factor the a number like
 

2593
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:43,750
uh so if we can factor the a number like
91 that's 7 times 13

2594
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:43,760

 

2595
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,990

but if i give you

2596
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:48,000

 

2597
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,030

20 digit or 30 digit numbers you're

00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:51,040
20 digit or 30 digit numbers you're
 

2599
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,109
20 digit or 30 digit numbers you're
probably going to be at a loss to

00:52:53,109 --> 00:52:53,119
probably going to be at a loss to
 

2601
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,710
probably going to be at a loss to
have any idea whether they can be

smaller numbers you can quickly verify
 

2619
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,829
smaller numbers you can quickly verify
that they are factors of the number

2620
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:19,839
that they are factors of the number
 

2621

00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:28,640
can you explain how that's possible to
 

2677
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,109
can you explain how that's possible to
tie together so many problems

2678
00:54:31,109 --> 00:54:31,119
tie together so many problems
 

2679
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:33,430
tie together so many problems
in a nice bunch that if one is proven to

00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:33,440
in a nice bunch that if one is proven to
 

2681
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,950
in a nice bunch that if one is proven to
be efficient

then all are the first

2684
00:54:38,069 --> 00:54:38,079
then all are the first
 

2685
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,109
then all are the first
and most important stage of progress was

2686
00:54:41,109 --> 00:54:41,119
and most important stage of progress was
 

2687
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:46,789
and most important stage of progress was
a result by stephen cook

2688
00:54:46,789 --> 00:54:46,799

 

2689
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:49,829

who showed that a certain problem called

2690
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:49,839
who showed that a certain problem called
 

2691
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:52,470
who showed that a certain problem called
the satisfiability problem

2692
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:52,480
the satisfiability problem
 

2693
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,829
the satisfiability problem
of propositional logic

2694
00:54:55,829 --> 00:54:55,839
of propositional logic
 

2695
00:54:55,839 --> 00:55:00,150
of propositional logic
is as hard as any problem in the class p

2696
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:00,160
is as hard as any problem in the class p
 

2697
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,190
is as hard as any problem in the class p
so the propositional logic problem

2698
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:03,200
so the propositional logic problem
 

2699
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:07,430
so the propositional logic problem
is expressed in terms of

2700
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:07,440
is expressed in terms of
 

2701
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,750
is expressed in terms of
expressions involving the logical

2702
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:09,760
expressions involving the logical
 

2703
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,030
expressions involving the logical
operations

2704
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:11,040
operations
 

2705
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,150
operations
and or and not offering operating

2706
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:14,160
and or and not offering operating
 

2707
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,109
and or and not offering operating
operating on variables that can be

2708
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:17,119
operating on variables that can be
 

2709
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:19,190
operating on variables that can be
either true or false

2710
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:19,200
either true or false
 

2711
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,510
either true or false
so an instance of the problem would be

2712
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:23,520
so an instance of the problem would be
 

2713
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:28,069
so an instance of the problem would be
some formula involving and or and not

2714
00:55:28,069 --> 00:55:28,079
some formula involving and or and not
 

2715
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,150
some formula involving and or and not
and the question would be whether there

2716
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:30,160
and the question would be whether there
 

2717
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,430
and the question would be whether there
is an assignment of

2718
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:31,440
is an assignment of
 

2719
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,910
is an assignment of
truth values to the variables in the

00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:33,920
truth values to the variables in the
 

2721
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:34,710
truth values to the variables in the
problem

2722
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:34,720
problem
 

2723
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,750
problem
that would make the formula true so for

2724
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:37,760
that would make the formula true so for
 

2725
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,829
that would make the formula true so for
example if i take

four of those

2734
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:52,480
four of those
 

2735
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,910
four of those
so-called expressions you can determine

2736
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:55,920
so-called expressions you can determine
 

2737
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,549
so-called expressions you can determine
that

2738
00:55:56,549 --> 00:55:56,559
that
 

2739
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,349
that
no assignment of truth values to the

2740
00:55:59,349 --> 00:55:59,359
no assignment of truth values to the
 

2741
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:01,750
no assignment of truth values to the
variables a and b

2742
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:01,760
variables a and b
 

2743
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,430
variables a and b
will allow that conjunction of

00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:05,440
will allow that conjunction of
 

2745
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,109
will allow that conjunction of
cl what are called clauses uh to be true

2746
00:56:09,109 --> 00:56:09,119
cl what are called clauses uh to be true
 

2747
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:12,470
cl what are called clauses uh to be true
so that's an example of a formula

2748
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:12,480
so that's an example of a formula
 

2749
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,870
so that's an example of a formula
in propositional logic

2755
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,789
operations and
or and not um that's an example of a

2756
00:56:24,789 --> 00:56:24,799
or and not um that's an example of a
 

2757
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:26,309
or and not um that's an example of a

00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:28,480
satisfiable there is no solution that
 

2761
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,030
satisfiable there is no solution that
satisfies all of those constraints

satisfies all of those constraints
 

2763
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,030
satisfies all of those constraints
and that's like one of the cleanest and

2764
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:33,040
and that's like one of the cleanest and
 

2765
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,190
and that's like one of the cleanest and

01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,190
so the p versus np
can be re-expressed is simply asking

2944

2955
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:30,230

uh i i encountered cook's paper

2956
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:30,240
uh i i encountered cook's paper
 

2957
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,829
uh i i encountered cook's paper
when he published it in a conference in

yeah so when i saw uh cook's paper and

2962
01:00:37,829 --> 01:00:37,839
yeah so when i saw uh cook's paper and
 

2963
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:39,030
yeah so when i saw uh cook's paper and
saw

2964
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:39,040
saw
 

2965
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,390
saw
this uh reduction event of all of each

01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:15,920
seemed to have that universal structure
 

2993
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:20,309
seemed to have that universal structure
and so i began looking for

2994
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:20,319
and so i began looking for
 

2995
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:23,990
and so i began looking for
reductions from the satisfiability

2996
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:24,000
reductions from the satisfiability
 

2997
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:30,470
reductions from the satisfiability
to other problems

2998
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:30,480

 

2999
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,349

one of the other problems would be the

3000
01:01:33,349 --> 01:01:33,359
one of the other problems would be the
 

3001
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:35,589
one of the other problems would be the
so-called integer programming problem

3002
01:01:35,589 --> 01:01:35,599
so-called integer programming problem
 

3003
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:39,510
so-called integer programming problem
of solving a determining whether there's

3004
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:39,520
of solving a determining whether there's
 

3005
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,510
of solving a determining whether there's
a solution to a

3006
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:41,520
a solution to a
 

3007
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:45,030
a solution to a
um a set of linear inequalities

3008
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:45,040
um a set of linear inequalities
 

3009
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:45,750
um a set of linear inequalities
involving

3010
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:45,760
involving
 

3011
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:48,950
involving
integer variables just like linear

3012
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:48,960
integer variables just like linear
 

3013
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,789
integer variables just like linear
programming but there's a constraint

3014
01:01:50,789 --> 01:01:50,799
programming but there's a constraint
 

3015
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:53,589
programming but there's a constraint
that the variables must remain integers

3016
01:01:53,589 --> 01:01:53,599
that the variables must remain integers
 

3017
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:55,910
that the variables must remain integers
integers in fact must be either zero or

3018
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:55,920
integers in fact must be either zero or
 

3019
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:56,309
integers in fact must be either zero or
one

3020
01:01:56,309 --> 01:01:56,319
one
 

3021
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:57,910
one
because they could only take on those

3022
01:01:57,910 --> 01:01:57,920
because they could only take on those
 

3023
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,510
because they could only take on those
values and that makes the problem much

3024
01:01:59,510 --> 01:01:59,520
values and that makes the problem much
 

3025
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:00,789
values and that makes the problem much
harder

3026
01:02:00,789 --> 01:02:00,799
harder
 

3027
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:03,670
harder
yes that makes the problem much harder

3028
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:03,680
yes that makes the problem much harder
 

3029
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:04,630
yes that makes the problem much harder
and

3030
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:04,640
and
 

3031
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:08,069
and
it was not difficult to show that

3032
01:02:08,069 --> 01:02:08,079
it was not difficult to show that
 

3033
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:10,309
it was not difficult to show that
the satisfiability problem can be

3034
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:10,319
the satisfiability problem can be
 

3035
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:11,589
the satisfiability problem can be
restated

3036
01:02:11,589 --> 01:02:11,599
restated
 

3037
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:14,309
restated
as an integer programming problem so can

3038
01:02:14,309 --> 01:02:14,319
as an integer programming problem so can
 

3039
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:15,829
as an integer programming problem so can
you pause on that was that one of the

3040
01:02:15,829 --> 01:02:15,839
you pause on that was that one of the
 

3041
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:16,630
you pause on that was that one of the
first problem

3042
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:16,640
first problem
 

3043
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:19,750
first problem
mappings that you try to do and how hard

3044
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:19,760
mappings that you try to do and how hard
 

3045
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,430
mappings that you try to do and how hard
is that map you said it wasn't hard to

3046
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:21,440
is that map you said it wasn't hard to
 

3047
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,230
is that map you said it wasn't hard to
show but

3048
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:22,240
show but
 

3049
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:26,069
show but
you know that's a that's a big

3050
01:02:26,069 --> 01:02:26,079
you know that's a that's a big
 

3051
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:29,270
you know that's a that's a big
leap it is a big leap yeah

3052
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:29,280
leap it is a big leap yeah
 

3053
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,190
leap it is a big leap yeah
well let me let me give you another

3054
01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:31,200
well let me let me give you another
 

3055
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,870
well let me let me give you another
example um

3056
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:32,880
example um
 

3057
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,109
example um
another problem in np is whether a graph

3058
01:02:37,109 --> 01:02:37,119
another problem in np is whether a graph
 

3059
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:42,870
another problem in np is whether a graph
contains a clique of a given size

3060
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:42,880

 

3061
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:48,710

and now the question is can we reduce

3062
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:48,720
and now the question is can we reduce
 

3063
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,150
and now the question is can we reduce
the propositional

3064
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:50,160

01:02:58,549 --> 01:02:58,559

 

3071
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,309

well if you look at the propositional

3072
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:00,319
well if you look at the propositional
 

3073
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:02,549
well if you look at the propositional
logic problem it can be expressed as a

3074
01:03:02,549 --> 01:03:02,559
logic problem it can be expressed as a
 

3075
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:04,150
logic problem it can be expressed as a

so the pro the question of uh
the in the satisfiability problem

3114
01:04:01,109 --> 01:04:01,119
the in the satisfiability problem
 

3115
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:03,549
the in the satisfiability problem
is whether those clauses can be

3116
01:04:03,549 --> 01:04:03,559
is whether those clauses can be
 

3117
01:04:03,559 --> 01:04:04,950
is whether those clauses can be
simultaneously

3118
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:04,960
simultaneously
 

3119
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:08,390
simultaneously
satisfied now to satisfy all those

3120
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:08,400
satisfied now to satisfy all those
 

3121
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,990
satisfied now to satisfy all those
clauses you have to

3122
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:10,000
clauses you have to
 

3123
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,750
clauses you have to
find one of the terms in each clause

3124
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:13,760
find one of the terms in each clause
 

3125
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:17,029
find one of the terms in each clause
which is going to be given that which is

3126
01:04:17,029 --> 01:04:17,039
which is going to be given that which is
 

3127
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:18,870
which is going to be given that which is
going to be true in your truth

3128
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:18,880
going to be true in your truth
 

3129
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,630
going to be true in your truth
assignment

3130
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:20,640
assignment
 

3131
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,190
assignment
but you can't make the same variable

3132
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:23,200
but you can't make the same variable
 

3133
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,630
but you can't make the same variable
both true and false

3134
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:24,640
both true and false
 

3135
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:27,829
both true and false
so if you have the variable a

3136
01:04:27,829 --> 01:04:27,839
so if you have the variable a
 

3137
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:31,349
so if you have the variable a
in one clause and you want to

3138
01:04:31,349 --> 01:04:31,359
in one clause and you want to
 

3139
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:34,309
in one clause and you want to
satisfy that clause by making a true you

3140
01:04:34,309 --> 01:04:34,319
satisfy that clause by making a true you
 

3141
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:36,630
satisfy that clause by making a true you
can't also make

3142
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:36,640
can't also make
 

3143
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,789
can't also make
the complement of a true in some other

3144
01:04:38,789 --> 01:04:38,799
the complement of a true in some other
 

3145
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:40,870
the complement of a true in some other
clause and so the goal is to make every

3146
01:04:40,870 --> 01:04:40,880
clause and so the goal is to make every
 

3147
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,549
clause and so the goal is to make every
single clause

3148
01:04:42,549 --> 01:04:42,559
single clause
 

3149
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:45,190
single clause
true if it's possible to satisfy this

3150
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:45,200
true if it's possible to satisfy this
 

3151
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:45,750
true if it's possible to satisfy this
and

3152
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:45,760
and
 

3153
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,950
and
the way you make it true is at least one

3154
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:48,960
the way you make it true is at least one
 

3155
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,349
the way you make it true is at least one
term in the clause must be

3156
01:04:51,349 --> 01:04:51,359
term in the clause must be
 

3157
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:54,390
term in the clause must be
it must be true so

3158
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:54,400
it must be true so
 

3159
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,309
it must be true so
so now we uh to convert this problem

3160
01:04:58,309 --> 01:04:58,319
so now we uh to convert this problem
 

3161
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:00,630
so now we uh to convert this problem
to something called the independent set

3162
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:00,640
to something called the independent set
 

3163
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,589
to something called the independent set
problem where you're

3164
01:05:01,589 --> 01:05:01,599
problem where you're
 

3165
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:05,510
problem where you're
just sort of asking for a set of

3166
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:05,520
just sort of asking for a set of
 

3167
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,750
just sort of asking for a set of
vertices in a graph such that no two of

3168
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:07,760
vertices in a graph such that no two of
 

3169
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,670
vertices in a graph such that no two of
them are adjacent sort of the opposite

3170
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:09,680
them are adjacent sort of the opposite
 

3171
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:14,870
them are adjacent sort of the opposite
of the clique problem

3172
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:14,880

 

3173
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:18,630

so we've seen that we can now

3174
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:18,640
so we've seen that we can now
 

3175
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:24,870
so we've seen that we can now
express that as

3176
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:24,880

 

3177
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:29,349

finding a

3178
01:05:29,349 --> 01:05:29,359

 

3179
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:32,789

set of terms one in each clause

3180
01:05:32,789 --> 01:05:32,799
set of terms one in each clause
 

3181
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:36,150
set of terms one in each clause
without picking both the variable

3182
01:05:36,150 --> 01:05:36,160
without picking both the variable
 

3183
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,870
without picking both the variable
and the negation of that variable

3184
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:38,880
and the negation of that variable
 

3185
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,870
and the negation of that variable
because you if the variable is assigned

3186
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:40,880
because you if the variable is assigned
 

3187
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,630
because you if the variable is assigned
the truth value

3188
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:42,640
the truth value
 

3189
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,309
the truth value
the negated variable has to have the

3190
01:05:44,309 --> 01:05:44,319
the negated variable has to have the
 

3191
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:46,230
the negated variable has to have the
opposite truth value

3192
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:46,240
opposite truth value
 

3193
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:50,309
opposite truth value
right and so we can construct the graph

3194
01:05:50,309 --> 01:05:50,319
right and so we can construct the graph
 

3195
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:54,549
right and so we can construct the graph
where the vertices are the

3196
01:05:54,549 --> 01:05:54,559
where the vertices are the
 

3197
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:58,150
where the vertices are the
terms in all of the clauses

3198
01:05:58,150 --> 01:05:58,160
terms in all of the clauses
 

3199
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:02,829
terms in all of the clauses
and you have an edge

3200
01:06:02,829 --> 01:06:02,839
and you have an edge
 

3201
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:07,589
and you have an edge
between two

3202
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:07,599

 

3203
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:11,190

terms if um

3204
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:11,200
terms if um
 

3205
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,230
terms if um
if an edge between

3206
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:14,240
if an edge between
 

3207
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:17,750
if an edge between
two occurrences of terms

3208
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:17,760
two occurrences of terms
 

3209
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,430
two occurrences of terms
if they're both in the same clause

3210
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:19,440
if they're both in the same clause
 

3211
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,510
if they're both in the same clause
because you're only picking one

3212
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:21,520
because you're only picking one
 

3213
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,789
because you're only picking one
element from each clause and also

3214
01:06:24,789 --> 01:06:24,799
element from each clause and also
 

3215
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:27,430
element from each clause and also
an edge between them if they represent

3216
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:27,440
an edge between them if they represent
 

3217
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,829
an edge between them if they represent
opposite values of the same variable

3218
01:06:29,829 --> 01:06:29,839
opposite values of the same variable
 

3219
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:31,670
opposite values of the same variable
because you can't make a variable both

3220
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:31,680
because you can't make a variable both
 

3221
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,190
because you can't make a variable both
true and false

3222
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:33,200
true and false
 

3223
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,589
true and false
and so you get a graph where you have

3224
01:06:35,589 --> 01:06:35,599
and so you get a graph where you have
 

3225
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:36,230
and so you get a graph where you have
all of these

3226
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:36,240
all of these
 

3227
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:39,589
all of these
occurrences of variables you have edges

3228
01:06:39,589 --> 01:06:39,599
occurrences of variables you have edges
 

3229
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:41,430
occurrences of variables you have edges
which which mean that you're not allowed

3230
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:41,440
which which mean that you're not allowed
 

3231
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,510
which which mean that you're not allowed
to choose

3232
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:43,520
to choose
 

3233
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,510
to choose
both ends of the edge either because

3234
01:06:45,510 --> 01:06:45,520
both ends of the edge either because
 

3235
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,829
both ends of the edge either because
they're in the same clause or they're

3236
01:06:47,829 --> 01:06:47,839
they're in the same clause or they're
 

3237
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:50,630
they're in the same clause or they're
con negations of one another all right

3238
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:50,640
con negations of one another all right
 

3239
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,470
con negations of one another all right
and that's uh

3240
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:52,480
and that's uh
 

3241
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,470
and that's uh
first of all sort of to zoom out that's

3242
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:54,480
first of all sort of to zoom out that's
 

3243
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:58,150
first of all sort of to zoom out that's
a really powerful idea that you can take

3244
01:06:58,150 --> 01:06:58,160
a really powerful idea that you can take
 

3245
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:01,349
a really powerful idea that you can take
a graph and connect it to a

3246
01:07:01,349 --> 01:07:01,359
a graph and connect it to a
 

3247
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:04,549
a graph and connect it to a
logic equation right somehow and do that

3248
01:07:04,549 --> 01:07:04,559
logic equation right somehow and do that
 

3249
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:05,349
logic equation right somehow and do that
mapping for

3250
01:07:05,349 --> 01:07:05,359
mapping for
 

3251
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:08,309
mapping for
all possible formulations of a

3252
01:07:08,309 --> 01:07:08,319
all possible formulations of a
 

3253
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:10,150
all possible formulations of a
particular problem on a graph

3254
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:10,160
particular problem on a graph
 

3255
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:13,510
particular problem on a graph
yeah i mean that that

3256
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:13,520
yeah i mean that that
 

3257
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,470
yeah i mean that that
still is hard for me to believe that

3258
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:16,480
still is hard for me to believe that
 

3259
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,750
still is hard for me to believe that
that's possible

3260
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:17,760
that's possible
 

3261
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,750
that's possible
that that they're like what do you make

3262
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:19,760
that that they're like what do you make
 

3263
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:20,789
that that they're like what do you make
of that

3264
01:07:20,789 --> 01:07:20,799
of that
 

3265
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:24,710
of that
that um there's such a union of

3266
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:24,720
that um there's such a union of
 

3267
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,710
that um there's such a union of
there's such a friendship among all

3268
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:26,720
there's such a friendship among all
 

3269
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,710
there's such a friendship among all
these problems across

3270
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:28,720
these problems across
 

3271
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:31,750
these problems across
that somehow are akin to combinatorial

3272
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:31,760
that somehow are akin to combinatorial
 

3273
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:35,029
that somehow are akin to combinatorial
uh algorithms that they're all somehow

3274
01:07:35,029 --> 01:07:35,039
uh algorithms that they're all somehow
 

3275
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:35,670

yeah i i know it can be proven yeah but

3278
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:38,720
yeah i i know it can be proven yeah but
 

3279
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:39,910
yeah i i know it can be proven yeah but
what do you make of it

3280
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:39,920
what do you make of it
 

3281
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:43,029
what do you make of it
that that that's true

3282
01:07:43,029 --> 01:07:43,039
that that that's true
 

3283
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:45,510
that that that's true
well if they just have the same

3284
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:45,520
well if they just have the same
 

3285
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,710
well if they just have the same
expressive power

3286
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:46,720
expressive power
 

3287
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:50,309
expressive power
you can take any one of them and

3288
01:07:50,309 --> 01:07:50,319
you can take any one of them and
 

3289
01:07:50,319 --> 01:07:52,950
you can take any one of them and
translate it into the terms of the other

3290
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:52,960
translate it into the terms of the other
 

3291
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:53,430
translate it into the terms of the other
you know

3292
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:53,440
you know
 

3293
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:54,630
you know
the fact that they have the same

3294
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:54,640
the fact that they have the same
 

3295
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,789
the fact that they have the same
expressive power also somehow

3296
01:07:56,789 --> 01:07:56,799
expressive power also somehow
 

3297
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,950
expressive power also somehow
means that they can be translatable

3298
01:07:58,950 --> 01:07:58,960
means that they can be translatable
 

3299
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,150
means that they can be translatable
right

3300
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:00,160
right
 

3301
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:03,910
right
and what i did in the 1971 paper was to

01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:29,440
expressive proper uh expressive power
 

3323
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,430
expressive proper uh expressive power
so and that was like throwing down the

3324
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:31,440
so and that was like throwing down the
 

3325
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,510
so and that was like throwing down the
gauntlet of saying

3326
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:33,520
gauntlet of saying
 

3327
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,349
gauntlet of saying
there's probably many more problems like

3328
01:08:35,349 --> 01:08:35,359
there's probably many more problems like
 

3329
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:37,829
there's probably many more problems like
this right but that's just saying that

3330
01:08:37,829 --> 01:08:37,839
this right but that's just saying that
 

3331
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:38,630
this right but that's just saying that
look that

3332
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:38,640
look that
 

3333
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,070
look that
they're all the same they're all the

3334
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:40,080
they're all the same they're all the
 

3335
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,950
they're all the same they're all the
same but not exactly

3336
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:42,960
same but not exactly
 

3337
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:44,789
same but not exactly
yeah yeah they're all the same in terms

3338
01:08:44,789 --> 01:08:44,799
yeah yeah they're all the same in terms
 

3339
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:47,590
yeah yeah they're all the same in terms
of whether they are

3340
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:47,600
of whether they are
 

3341
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,870
of whether they are
um rich enough to express any of the

3342
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:50,880
um rich enough to express any of the
 

3343
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,749
um rich enough to express any of the
others

3344
01:08:53,749 --> 01:08:53,759
others
 

3345
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:55,269
others
but that doesn't mean that they have the

3346
01:08:55,269 --> 01:08:55,279
but that doesn't mean that they have the
 

3347
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:57,749
but that doesn't mean that they have the
same computational complexity

3348
01:08:57,749 --> 01:08:57,759
same computational complexity
 

3349
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:00,870
same computational complexity
but what we can say is that either

3350
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:00,880
but what we can say is that either
 

3351
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,870
but what we can say is that either
all of these problems or none of them

3352
01:09:02,870 --> 01:09:02,880
all of these problems or none of them
 

3353
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:05,669
all of these problems or none of them
are solvable in polynomial time

3354
01:09:05,669 --> 01:09:05,679
are solvable in polynomial time
 

3355
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:08,630
are solvable in polynomial time
yeah so where does np completeness and

3356
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:08,640
yeah so where does np completeness and
 

3357
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:09,269
yeah so where does np completeness and
np

3358
01:09:09,269 --> 01:09:09,279
np
 

3359
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:12,309
np
hard classes well that's just a small

3360
01:09:12,309 --> 01:09:12,319
hard classes well that's just a small
 

3361
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,990
hard classes well that's just a small
technicality

3362
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:14,000
technicality
 

3363
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,990
technicality
so when we're talking about decision

3364
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:16,000
so when we're talking about decision
 

3365
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,189
so when we're talking about decision
problems

3366
01:09:17,189 --> 01:09:17,199
problems
 

3367
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:19,669
problems
that means that the answer is just yes

3368
01:09:19,669 --> 01:09:19,679
that means that the answer is just yes
 

3369
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:21,269
that means that the answer is just yes
or no

3370
01:09:21,269 --> 01:09:21,279
or no
 

3371
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,669
or no
there is a clique of size 15 or there's

3372
01:09:23,669 --> 01:09:23,679
there is a clique of size 15 or there's
 

3373
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:26,709
there is a clique of size 15 or there's
not a clique of size 15.

3374
01:09:26,709 --> 01:09:26,719
not a clique of size 15.
 

3375
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:28,309
not a clique of size 15.
on the other hand an optimization

3376
01:09:28,309 --> 01:09:28,319
on the other hand an optimization
 

3377
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:31,110
on the other hand an optimization
problem would be asking

3378
01:09:31,110 --> 01:09:31,120
problem would be asking
 

3379
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,749
problem would be asking
find the largest clique the answer would

3380
01:09:33,749 --> 01:09:33,759
find the largest clique the answer would
 

3381
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:35,669
find the largest clique the answer would
not be yes or no it would be

3382
01:09:35,669 --> 01:09:35,679
not be yes or no it would be
 

3383
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:39,510
not be yes or no it would be
15. so um

3384
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:39,520
15. so um
 

3385
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:42,950
15. so um
so when you're asking for the

3386
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:42,960

 

3387
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:44,709

when you're putting a valuation on the

3388
01:09:44,709 --> 01:09:44,719
when you're putting a valuation on the
 

3389
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:46,550
when you're putting a valuation on the
different solutions

3390
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:46,560
different solutions
 

3391
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:47,990
different solutions
and you're asking for the one with the

3392
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:48,000
and you're asking for the one with the
 

3393
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,229
and you're asking for the one with the
highest valuation that's an optimization

3394
01:09:50,229 --> 01:09:50,239
highest valuation that's an optimization
 

3395
01:09:50,239 --> 01:09:51,269
highest valuation that's an optimization
problem

3396
01:09:51,269 --> 01:09:51,279
problem
 

3397
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:52,870
problem
and there's a very close affinity

3398
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:52,880
and there's a very close affinity
 

3399
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,430
and there's a very close affinity
between the two kinds of problems

3400
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:55,440
between the two kinds of problems
 

3401
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:58,870
between the two kinds of problems
but the counterpart of

3402
01:09:58,870 --> 01:09:58,880
but the counterpart of
 

3403
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:02,149
but the counterpart of
being the hardest decision problem

3404
01:10:02,149 --> 01:10:02,159
being the hardest decision problem
 

3405
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:04,630
being the hardest decision problem
the hardest yes no problem the kind of

3406
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:04,640
the hardest yes no problem the kind of
 

3407
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,550
the hardest yes no problem the kind of
part of that

3408
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:06,560
part of that
 

3409
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:11,669
part of that
uh is is to minimize or maximize

3410
01:10:11,669 --> 01:10:11,679
uh is is to minimize or maximize
 

3411
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:14,470
uh is is to minimize or maximize
an objective function and so a problem

3412
01:10:14,470 --> 01:10:14,480
an objective function and so a problem
 

3413
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:14,870
an objective function and so a problem
that's

3414
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:14,880
that's
 

3415
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:18,229
that's
hardest in the class when viewed in

3416
01:10:18,229 --> 01:10:18,239
hardest in the class when viewed in
 

3417
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:19,830
hardest in the class when viewed in
terms of optimization

3418
01:10:19,830 --> 01:10:19,840
terms of optimization
 

3419
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:23,270
terms of optimization
those are called np-hard rather than

3420
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:23,280
those are called np-hard rather than
 

3421
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,430
those are called np-hard rather than
np-complete and np-complete is for

3422
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:25,440
np-complete and np-complete is for
 

3423
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,430
np-complete and np-complete is for
decision problems and np-complete is for

3424
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:27,440
decision problems and np-complete is for
 

3425
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:31,350
decision problems and np-complete is for
decision problems so

3426
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:31,360
decision problems so
 

3427
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:35,590
decision problems so
if somebody shows that p equals np

3428
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:35,600
if somebody shows that p equals np
 

3429
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,990
if somebody shows that p equals np
what do you think that proof will look

3430
01:10:37,990 --> 01:10:38,000
what do you think that proof will look
 

3431
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,350
what do you think that proof will look
like

3432
01:10:39,350 --> 01:10:39,360
like
 

3433
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,990
like
if you were to put on yourself if it's

3434
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:42,000
if you were to put on yourself if it's
 

3435
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,189
if you were to put on yourself if it's
possible to show that as a proof

3436
01:10:45,189 --> 01:10:45,199
possible to show that as a proof
 

3437
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:48,950
possible to show that as a proof
or to demonstrate an algorithm

3438
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:48,960
or to demonstrate an algorithm
 

3439
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,510
or to demonstrate an algorithm
all i can say is that it will involve

3440
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:51,520
all i can say is that it will involve
 

3441
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,910
all i can say is that it will involve
concepts that we do not now have

3442
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:53,920
concepts that we do not now have
 

3443
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,470
concepts that we do not now have
and approaches that we don't have do you

3444
01:10:56,470 --> 01:10:56,480
and approaches that we don't have do you
 

3445
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:58,550
and approaches that we don't have do you
think those concepts are out there

3446
01:10:58,550 --> 01:10:58,560
think those concepts are out there
 

3447
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,910
think those concepts are out there
in terms of inside complexity theory

01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:01,920
in terms of inside complexity theory

01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,669
inside of computational analysis of
algorithms do you think there's concepts

3452
01:11:05,669 --> 01:11:05,679
algorithms do you think there's concepts
 

3453
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:07,669
algorithms do you think there's concepts
that are totally outside of the box

that are totally outside of the box
 

3455
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:09,430
that are totally outside of the box
that we haven't considered yet i think

01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:09,440
that we haven't considered yet i think
 

3457
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:12,070
that we haven't considered yet i think
that if there is a proof that p

what impact you kind of mentioned a

3474
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:31,840
what impact you kind of mentioned a
 

3475
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:32,790
what impact you kind of mentioned a
little bit but can you

01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:32,800
little bit but can you
 

3477
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,950
little bit but can you
can you linger on it what kind of impact

3478
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:34,960
can you linger on it what kind of impact
 

3479
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,709
can you linger on it what kind of impact
would it have

3480
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:36,719
would it have
 

3481
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:38,390
would it have
on theoretical computer science and

these systems in general well i think it
 

3487
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,510
these systems in general well i think it
would have enormous impact on the

then we know that we're in that for the

there's a little bit of hope in that

there's a little bit of hope in that
 

3511
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,110
there's a little bit of hope in that
it may be that we can solve most

um but but basically it will

01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,990
um but but basically it will
um it will if we find that p is unequal

um it will if we find that p is unequal
 

3527
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,390
um it will if we find that p is unequal
to np it will mean that we can't

3573
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:28,070
problem
yeah imagine that you

3574
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:28,080
yeah imagine that you
 

3575
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:31,510
yeah imagine that you
want to marry off n boys

3576
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:31,520
want to marry off n boys
 

3577
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:37,110
want to marry off n boys
with uh and girls

3578
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:37,120

 

3579
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:40,229

and each boy has an ordered list of his

3580
01:13:40,229 --> 01:13:40,239
and each boy has an ordered list of his
 

3581
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:42,149
and each boy has an ordered list of his
preferences among the girls

3582
01:13:42,149 --> 01:13:42,159
preferences among the girls
 

3583
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:44,630
preferences among the girls
his first choice is second choice

3584
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:44,640
his first choice is second choice
 

3585
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,350
his first choice is second choice
through her nth choice

3586
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:47,360
through her nth choice
 

3587
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:51,910
through her nth choice
and um

3588
01:13:51,910 --> 01:13:51,920

 

3589
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,709

each girl also has a an ordering of the

3590
01:13:54,709 --> 01:13:54,719
each girl also has a an ordering of the
 

3591
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:57,110
each girl also has a an ordering of the
boys first choice second choice and so

3592
01:13:57,110 --> 01:13:57,120
boys first choice second choice and so
 

3593
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,790
boys first choice second choice and so
on

3594
01:13:58,790 --> 01:13:58,800
on
 

3595
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:02,390
on
and we'll say and we will say that a

01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:02,400
and we'll say and we will say that a
 

3597
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,430
and we'll say and we will say that a

01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:08,790
one-to-one matching of the boys with the
girls is stable

3602
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:08,800
girls is stable
 

3603
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,910
girls is stable
if there are

01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:11,920

 

3605
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:15,030

no two couples in the matching

3606
01:14:15,030 --> 01:14:15,040
no two couples in the matching
 

3607
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:18,550
no two couples in the matching
such that the boy in the first couple

3608
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:18,560
such that the boy in the first couple
 

3609
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:21,669
such that the boy in the first couple
prefers the girl in the second couple to

01:14:21,669 --> 01:14:21,679
prefers the girl in the second couple to
 

3611
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:23,189
prefers the girl in the second couple to
her mate

her mate
 

3613
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:26,550
her mate
and she refers the boy to her current

01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:26,560
and she refers the boy to her current
 

3615
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:29,189

3617
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:32,070

01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:32,080
the matching is stable if there is no

01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,110
the matching is stable if there is no

3620
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:33,120

01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:38,630
who want to run away with each other
leaving their partners behind

3624
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:38,640
leaving their partners behind
 

3625
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:42,390
leaving their partners behind
gosh yeah

3626
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:42,400
gosh yeah
 

3627
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:46,790
gosh yeah
uh yeah actually this is relevant to

3628
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:46,800
uh yeah actually this is relevant to
 

3629
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,910
uh yeah actually this is relevant to
matching uh uh residents with hospitals

3630
01:14:49,910 --> 01:14:49,920
matching uh uh residents with hospitals
 

3631
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,149
matching uh uh residents with hospitals
and some other real life problems

3632
01:14:52,149 --> 01:14:52,159
and some other real life problems
 

3633
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:53,430
and some other real life problems
although

3634
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:53,440
although
 

3635
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:56,870
although
not quite in the form that i described

3636
01:14:56,870 --> 01:14:56,880
not quite in the form that i described
 

3637
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,990
not quite in the form that i described
so it turns out that there is that a

3638
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:00,000
so it turns out that there is that a
 

3639
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,550
so it turns out that there is that a
stable for any set of preferences

3640
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:02,560
stable for any set of preferences
 

3641
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,910
stable for any set of preferences
a stable matching exists

3642
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:05,920
a stable matching exists
 

3643
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:11,030
a stable matching exists
and um moreover it can be computed

3644
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:11,040
and um moreover it can be computed
 

3645
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:15,590
and um moreover it can be computed
by a simple algorithm in which

3646
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:15,600
by a simple algorithm in which
 

3647
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,790
by a simple algorithm in which
each boy starts making proposals to

01:15:18,790 --> 01:15:18,800
each boy starts making proposals to
 

3649
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,870
each boy starts making proposals to
girls

3650
01:15:20,870 --> 01:15:20,880
girls
 

3651
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,830
girls
and if the girl receives the proposal

3652
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:23,840
and if the girl receives the proposal
 

3653
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,750
and if the girl receives the proposal
she accepts it tentatively

3654
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:25,760
she accepts it tentatively
 

3655
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:28,870
she accepts it tentatively
but she can

3656
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:28,880

 

3657
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,750

drop it if she can end it she can drop

3658
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:31,760
drop it if she can end it she can drop
 

3659
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:32,149
drop it if she can end it she can drop
it

3660
01:15:32,149 --> 01:15:32,159
it
 

3661
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:34,550
it
later if she gets a better proposal from

3662
01:15:34,550 --> 01:15:34,560
later if she gets a better proposal from
 

3663
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,550
later if she gets a better proposal from
her point of view

3664
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:36,560
her point of view
 

3665
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,470
her point of view
and the boys start going down their

3666
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:38,480
and the boys start going down their
 

3667
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,470
and the boys start going down their
lists proposing to their first second

3668
01:15:40,470 --> 01:15:40,480
lists proposing to their first second
 

3669
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:41,830
lists proposing to their first second
third choices

3670
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:41,840
third choices
 

3671
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:46,950
third choices
until stopping when

3672
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:46,960
until stopping when
 

3673
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:50,310
until stopping when
a proposal is accepted

3674
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:50,320
a proposal is accepted
 

3675
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,630
a proposal is accepted
but the girls meanwhile are watching the

3676
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:52,640
but the girls meanwhile are watching the
 

3677
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:55,189
but the girls meanwhile are watching the
proposals that are coming into them

3678
01:15:55,189 --> 01:15:55,199
proposals that are coming into them
 

3679
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:57,910
proposals that are coming into them
and the girl will drop her current

3680
01:15:57,910 --> 01:15:57,920
and the girl will drop her current
 

3681
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,590
and the girl will drop her current
partner

3682
01:15:59,590 --> 01:15:59,600
partner
 

3683
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:03,430
partner
um if she gets a better proposal

3684
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:03,440
um if she gets a better proposal
 

3685
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:06,149
um if she gets a better proposal
and the boys never go back through they

3686
01:16:06,149 --> 01:16:06,159
and the boys never go back through they
 

3687
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:07,189
and the boys never go back through they
they never go back

3688
01:16:07,189 --> 01:16:07,199
they never go back
 

3689
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:11,510
they never go back
yeah so once they've been denied

3690
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:11,520

 

3691
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,270

they don't try again they don't they

3692
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:13,280
they don't try again they don't they
 

3693
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:15,350
they don't try again they don't they
don't they don't try again because

3694
01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:15,360
don't they don't try again because
 

3695
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:18,550
don't they don't try again because
the girls are always improving their

3696
01:16:18,550 --> 01:16:18,560
the girls are always improving their
 

3697
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:21,270
the girls are always improving their
status as they get more as they receive

3698
01:16:21,270 --> 01:16:21,280
status as they get more as they receive
 

3699
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:23,910
status as they get more as they receive
better and better proposals the boys are

3700
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:23,920
better and better proposals the boys are
 

3701
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,669
better and better proposals the boys are
going down their list starting with

3702
01:16:25,669 --> 01:16:25,679
going down their list starting with
 

3703
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:28,550
going down their list starting with
their top preferences

3704
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:28,560
their top preferences
 

3705
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:31,750
their top preferences
and um

3706
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:31,760
and um
 

3707
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:35,990
and um
one can prove that

3708
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:36,000

 

3709
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,669

that the process will come to an end

3710
01:16:39,669 --> 01:16:39,679
that the process will come to an end
 

3711
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:42,070
that the process will come to an end
where everybody will get matched with

3712
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:42,080
where everybody will get matched with
 

3713
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,350
where everybody will get matched with
somebody

3714
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:43,360
somebody
 

3715
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:46,630
somebody
and you'll you won't have any pair that

3716
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:46,640
and you'll you won't have any pair that
 

3717
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,550
and you'll you won't have any pair that
want to

3718
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:48,560
want to
 

3719
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:50,790
want to
abscond from each other do you find the

3720
01:16:50,790 --> 01:16:50,800
abscond from each other do you find the
 

3721
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,110
abscond from each other do you find the
proof or the algorithm itself

3722
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:53,120
proof or the algorithm itself
 

3723
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:55,430
proof or the algorithm itself
beautiful or is it the fact that with

3724
01:16:55,430 --> 01:16:55,440
beautiful or is it the fact that with
 

3725
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,430
beautiful or is it the fact that with
the the simplicity of just

3726
01:16:57,430 --> 01:16:57,440
the the simplicity of just
 

3727
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:00,470
the the simplicity of just
the two marching i mean the simplicity

3728
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:00,480
the two marching i mean the simplicity
 

3729
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,470
the two marching i mean the simplicity
of the underlying rule of the algorithm

3730
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:02,480
of the underlying rule of the algorithm
 

3731
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:05,430
of the underlying rule of the algorithm
is that the beautiful part both i i

3732
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:05,440
is that the beautiful part both i i
 

3733
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:06,390
is that the beautiful part both i i
would say

3734
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:06,400
would say
 

3735
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:09,030
would say
um and you also have the observation

3736
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:09,040
um and you also have the observation
 

3737
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,229
um and you also have the observation
that

3738
01:17:10,229 --> 01:17:10,239
that
 

3739
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:13,110
that
you might ask who is better off the boys

3740
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:13,120
you might ask who is better off the boys
 

3741
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:13,910
you might ask who is better off the boys
who are doing the

3742
01:17:13,910 --> 01:17:13,920
who are doing the
 

3743
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,149
who are doing the
proposing or the girls who are reacting

3744
01:17:16,149 --> 01:17:16,159
proposing or the girls who are reacting
 

3745
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:17,590
proposing or the girls who are reacting
to proposals

3746
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:17,600
to proposals
 

3747
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,910
to proposals
and it turns out that it's it's the boys

3748
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:19,920
and it turns out that it's it's the boys
 

3749
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:20,630
and it turns out that it's it's the boys
who are doing

3750
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:20,640
who are doing
 

3751
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,830
who are doing
the doing the best that is each boy is

3752
01:17:23,830 --> 01:17:23,840
the doing the best that is each boy is
 

3753
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,750
the doing the best that is each boy is
doing at least as well

3754
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:25,760
doing at least as well
 

3755
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:29,030
doing at least as well
as uh he could do in any other stable

3756
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:29,040
as uh he could do in any other stable
 

3757
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,470
as uh he could do in any other stable
matching

3758
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:30,480
matching
 

3759
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:33,030
matching
so there's a sort of lesson for the boys

3760
01:17:33,030 --> 01:17:33,040
so there's a sort of lesson for the boys
 

3761
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:35,189
so there's a sort of lesson for the boys
that you should go out and be

3762
01:17:35,189 --> 01:17:35,199
that you should go out and be
 

3763
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:38,550
that you should go out and be
proactive and make those proposals

3764
01:17:38,550 --> 01:17:38,560
proactive and make those proposals
 

3765
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,830
proactive and make those proposals
go for broke yeah i don't know if the

3766
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:41,840
go for broke yeah i don't know if the
 

3767
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,430
go for broke yeah i don't know if the
this is directly mappable

3768
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:43,440
this is directly mappable
 

3769
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,590
this is directly mappable
philosophically to our society but uh

3770
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:45,600
philosophically to our society but uh
 

3771
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:46,390
philosophically to our society but uh
certainly

3772
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:46,400
certainly
 

3773
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:49,669
certainly
seems like a compelling notion and

3774
01:17:49,669 --> 01:17:49,679
seems like a compelling notion and
 

3775
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:51,430
seems like a compelling notion and
like you said there's probably a lot of

3776
01:17:51,430 --> 01:17:51,440
like you said there's probably a lot of
 

3777
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:52,950
like you said there's probably a lot of
actual real world problems that this

3778
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:52,960
actual real world problems that this
 

3779
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,550
actual real world problems that this
could be mapped to

3780
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:54,560
could be mapped to
 

3781
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:57,030
could be mapped to
yeah well you get you you get

3782
01:17:57,030 --> 01:17:57,040
yeah well you get you you get
 

3783
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,550
yeah well you get you you get
complications

3784
01:17:58,550 --> 01:17:58,560
complications
 

3785
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,030
complications
for example what happens when a husband

3786
01:18:01,030 --> 01:18:01,040
for example what happens when a husband
 

3787
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:02,870
for example what happens when a husband
and wife want to be assigned to the same

3788
01:18:02,870 --> 01:18:02,880
and wife want to be assigned to the same
 

3789
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:03,669
and wife want to be assigned to the same
hospital

3790
01:18:03,669 --> 01:18:03,679
hospital
 

3791
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:07,430
hospital
so you you have to

3792
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:07,440
so you you have to
 

3793
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:10,550
so you you have to
take those constraints into account and

3794
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:10,560
take those constraints into account and
 

3795
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,070
take those constraints into account and
then the problem becomes

3796
01:18:12,070 --> 01:18:12,080
then the problem becomes
 

3797
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:15,350
then the problem becomes
np hard or

3798
01:18:15,350 --> 01:18:15,360

 

3799
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:17,669

uh why is it a problem for the husband

3800
01:18:17,669 --> 01:18:17,679
uh why is it a problem for the husband
 

3801
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:18,870
uh why is it a problem for the husband
and wife to be assigned to the same

3802
01:18:18,870 --> 01:18:18,880
and wife to be assigned to the same
 

3803
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:19,910
and wife to be assigned to the same
hospital

3804
01:18:19,910 --> 01:18:19,920
hospital
 

3805
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,550
hospital
no it's desirable so desirable or at

3806
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:22,560
no it's desirable so desirable or at
 

3807
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,070
no it's desirable so desirable or at
least go to the same city

3808
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:24,080
least go to the same city
 

3809
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:27,270
least go to the same city
so you can't if you're i think if you're

3810
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:27,280
so you can't if you're i think if you're
 

3811
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:27,990
so you can't if you're i think if you're
assigning

3812
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:28,000
assigning
 

3813

3957
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:20,790

so the

3958
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:20,800
so the
 

3959
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,830
so the
the problem there is

3960
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:23,840
the problem there is
 

3961
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:27,830
the problem there is
to um

3962
01:21:27,830 --> 01:21:27,840

 

3963
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:31,669

is to decide whether uh

3964
01:21:31,669 --> 01:21:31,679
is to decide whether uh
 

3965
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:35,030
is to decide whether uh
a given long string of symbols from some

3966
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:35,040
a given long string of symbols from some
 

3967
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:39,030
a given long string of symbols from some
alphabet contains a given word

3968
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:39,040
alphabet contains a given word
 

3969
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,990
alphabet contains a given word
whether a particular word occurs within

3970
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:42,000
whether a particular word occurs within
 

3971
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,350
whether a particular word occurs within
some very much longer word

3972
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:45,360
some very much longer word
 

3973
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:50,229
some very much longer word
and so the the idea of the

3974
01:21:50,229 --> 01:21:50,239
and so the the idea of the
 

3975
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:53,830
and so the the idea of the
algorithm is to associate

3976
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:53,840
algorithm is to associate
 

3977
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:57,110
algorithm is to associate
with the word that we're looking for

3978
01:21:57,110 --> 01:21:57,120
with the word that we're looking for
 

3979
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:00,709
with the word that we're looking for
a fingerprint some

3980
01:22:00,709 --> 01:22:00,719
a fingerprint some
 

3981
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:03,830
a fingerprint some
some number or some

3982
01:22:03,830 --> 01:22:03,840
some number or some
 

3983
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:07,750
some number or some
combinatorial object that

3984
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:07,760

 

3985
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:11,430

describes that word and then to look for

3986
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:11,440
describes that word and then to look for
 

3987
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,430
describes that word and then to look for
an occurrence of that same fingerprint

3988
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:13,440
an occurrence of that same fingerprint
 

3989
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:18,470
an occurrence of that same fingerprint
as you slide along the longer word

3990
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:18,480

 

3991
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:22,550

and what we do is we

3992
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:22,560
and what we do is we
 

3993
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:26,229
and what we do is we
associate with each word a number

3994
01:22:26,229 --> 01:22:26,239
associate with each word a number
 

3995
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:27,990
associate with each word a number
so we first of all we think of the

3996
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:28,000
so we first of all we think of the
 

3997
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,390
so we first of all we think of the
letters that are kind of occur in a word

3998
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:30,400
letters that are kind of occur in a word
 

3999
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:33,750
letters that are kind of occur in a word
as the digits of let's say decimal or

4000
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:33,760
as the digits of let's say decimal or
 

4001
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:35,910
as the digits of let's say decimal or
whatever

4002
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:35,920
whatever
 

4003
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:40,310
whatever
base your whatever number of different

4004
01:22:40,310 --> 01:22:40,320
base your whatever number of different
 

4005
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:41,030
base your whatever number of different
symbols there

4006
01:22:41,030 --> 01:22:41,040
symbols there
 

4007
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:43,430
symbols there
are that's the base of the of the

4008
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:43,440
are that's the base of the of the
 

4009
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:45,110
are that's the base of the of the
numbers yeah right

4010
01:22:45,110 --> 01:22:45,120
numbers yeah right
 

4011
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,510
numbers yeah right
so every word can then be thought of as

4012
01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:47,520
so every word can then be thought of as
 

4013
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:48,149
so every word can then be thought of as
a number

4014
01:22:48,149 --> 01:22:48,159
a number
 

4015
01:22:48,159 --> 01:22:51,350
a number
with the letters being the digits of

4016
01:22:51,350 --> 01:22:51,360
with the letters being the digits of
 

4017
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,350
with the letters being the digits of
that number

4018
01:22:53,350 --> 01:22:53,360
that number
 

4019
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:56,229
that number
and then we pick a random prime number

4020
01:22:56,229 --> 01:22:56,239
and then we pick a random prime number
 

4021
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:58,550
and then we pick a random prime number
in a certain range

4022
01:22:58,550 --> 01:22:58,560
in a certain range
 

4023
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:03,189
in a certain range
and we take that word viewed as a number

4024
01:23:03,189 --> 01:23:03,199
and we take that word viewed as a number
 

4025
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:06,550
and we take that word viewed as a number
and take the remainder on dividing

4026
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:06,560
and take the remainder on dividing
 

4027
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:09,669
and take the remainder on dividing
the dividing that number

4028
01:23:09,669 --> 01:23:09,679
the dividing that number
 

4029
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:13,590
the dividing that number
by the prime so coming up with a nice

4030
01:23:13,590 --> 01:23:13,600
by the prime so coming up with a nice
 

4031
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:14,709
by the prime so coming up with a nice
hash function

4032
01:23:14,709 --> 01:23:14,719
hash function
 

4033
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:17,590
hash function
it's a it's a kind of hash function yeah

4034
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:17,600
it's a it's a kind of hash function yeah
 

4035
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:17,990
it's a it's a kind of hash function yeah
um

4036
01:23:17,990 --> 01:23:18,000
um
 

4037
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,790
um
it gives you a little little shortcut

4038
01:23:20,790 --> 01:23:20,800
it gives you a little little shortcut
 

4039
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,470
it gives you a little little shortcut
for for that particular word

4040
01:23:22,470 --> 01:23:22,480
for for that particular word
 

4041
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:25,910
for for that particular word
yeah that so that's the that's the

4042
01:23:25,910 --> 01:23:25,920
yeah that so that's the that's the
 

4043
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,390
yeah that so that's the that's the
uh it's very different than the any and

4044
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:28,400
uh it's very different than the any and
 

4045
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:29,910
uh it's very different than the any and
other algorithms

4046
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:29,920
other algorithms
 

4047
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,830
other algorithms
of its kind that we're trying to do

4048
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:31,840
of its kind that we're trying to do
 

4049
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,350
of its kind that we're trying to do
search uh

4050
01:23:33,350 --> 01:23:33,360
search uh
 

4051
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:36,470
search uh
string matching yeah which

4052
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:36,480
string matching yeah which
 

4053
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,629
string matching yeah which
usually are combinatorial and don't

4054
01:23:38,629 --> 01:23:38,639
usually are combinatorial and don't
 

4055
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:39,750
usually are combinatorial and don't
involve

4056
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:39,760
involve
 

4057
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:42,550
involve
the idea of taking a random fingerprint

4058
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:42,560
the idea of taking a random fingerprint
 

4059
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:43,510
the idea of taking a random fingerprint
yes

4060
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:43,520
yes
 

4061
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:46,629
yes
and doing the fingerprinting has

4062
01:23:46,629 --> 01:23:46,639
and doing the fingerprinting has
 

4063
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:49,350
and doing the fingerprinting has
two advantages one is that as we slide

4064
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:49,360
two advantages one is that as we slide
 

4065
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,430
two advantages one is that as we slide
along the long word

4066
01:23:51,430 --> 01:23:51,440
along the long word
 

4067
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:54,950
along the long word
digit by digit we can we we keep

4068
01:23:54,950 --> 01:23:54,960
digit by digit we can we we keep
 

4069
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,910
digit by digit we can we we keep
a window of of a certain size the size

4070
01:23:57,910 --> 01:23:57,920
a window of of a certain size the size
 

4071
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:58,149
a window of of a certain size the size
of

4072
01:23:58,149 --> 01:23:58,159
of
 

4073
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:02,149
of
the word we're looking for and we

4074
01:24:02,149 --> 01:24:02,159
the word we're looking for and we
 

4075
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:05,270
the word we're looking for and we
compute the fingerprint of every

4076
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:05,280
compute the fingerprint of every
 

4077
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:08,310
compute the fingerprint of every
stretch of that length and it turns out

4078
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:08,320
stretch of that length and it turns out
 

4079
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:08,790
stretch of that length and it turns out
that

4080
01:24:08,790 --> 01:24:08,800
that
 

4081
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,189
that
just a couple of arithmetic operations

4082
01:24:11,189 --> 01:24:11,199
just a couple of arithmetic operations
 

4083
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:11,910
just a couple of arithmetic operations
will take you

4084
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:11,920
will take you
 

4085
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:15,270
will take you
from the fingerprint of one part

4086
01:24:15,270 --> 01:24:15,280
from the fingerprint of one part
 

4087
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:17,350
from the fingerprint of one part
to what you get when you slide over by

4088
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:17,360
to what you get when you slide over by
 

4089
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,830
to what you get when you slide over by
one position

4090
01:24:19,830 --> 01:24:19,840
one position
 

4091
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,750
one position
so the computation of all the

4092
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:21,760
so the computation of all the
 

4093
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,030
so the computation of all the
fingerprints

4094
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:23,040
fingerprints
 

4095
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:26,629
fingerprints
is um simple

4096
01:24:26,629 --> 01:24:26,639
is um simple
 

4097
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:30,470
is um simple
and secondly it's unlikely

4098
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:30,480
and secondly it's unlikely
 

4099
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:33,030
and secondly it's unlikely
if the prime is chosen randomly from a

4100
01:24:33,030 --> 01:24:33,040
if the prime is chosen randomly from a
 

4101
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,390
if the prime is chosen randomly from a
certain range

4102
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:34,400
certain range
 

4103
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:37,510
certain range
that you will get two of the segments

4104
01:24:37,510 --> 01:24:37,520
that you will get two of the segments
 

4105
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:40,950
that you will get two of the segments
in question having the same fingerprint

4106
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:40,960
in question having the same fingerprint
 

4107
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,270
in question having the same fingerprint
right and so there's a small probability

4108
01:24:43,270 --> 01:24:43,280
right and so there's a small probability
 

4109
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:45,270
right and so there's a small probability
of error which can be checked after the

4110
01:24:45,270 --> 01:24:45,280
of error which can be checked after the
 

4111
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:46,390
of error which can be checked after the
fact

4112
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:46,400
fact
 

4113
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,830
fact
and also the ease of doing the

4114
01:24:47,830 --> 01:24:47,840
and also the ease of doing the
 

4115
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,590
and also the ease of doing the
computation because you're working with

4116
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:49,600
computation because you're working with
 

4117
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,510
computation because you're working with
these fingerprints

4118
01:24:51,510 --> 01:24:51,520
these fingerprints
 

4119
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,990
these fingerprints
which are remainders modulo some big

4120
01:24:53,990 --> 01:24:54,000
which are remainders modulo some big
 

4121
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,590
which are remainders modulo some big
prime

4122
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:55,600
prime
 

4123
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:56,870
prime
so that's the magical thing about

4124
01:24:56,870 --> 01:24:56,880
so that's the magical thing about
 

4125
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,870
so that's the magical thing about
randomized algorithms is that if you add

4126
01:24:58,870 --> 01:24:58,880
randomized algorithms is that if you add
 

4127
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,550
randomized algorithms is that if you add
a little bit

4128
01:25:00,550 --> 01:25:00,560
a little bit
 

4129
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:03,350
a little bit
of randomness it somehow allows you to

4130
01:25:03,350 --> 01:25:03,360
of randomness it somehow allows you to
 

4131
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,350
of randomness it somehow allows you to
take a pretty naive approach

4132
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:05,360
take a pretty naive approach
 

4133
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,229
take a pretty naive approach
a simple looking approach and allow it

4134
01:25:08,229 --> 01:25:08,239
a simple looking approach and allow it
 

4135
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:09,030
a simple looking approach and allow it
to run

4136
01:25:09,030 --> 01:25:09,040
to run
 

4137
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:12,790
to run
extremely well so can you maybe

4138
01:25:12,790 --> 01:25:12,800
extremely well so can you maybe
 

4139
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,790
extremely well so can you maybe
take a step back and say like what is a

4140
01:25:14,790 --> 01:25:14,800
take a step back and say like what is a
 

4141
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,709
take a step back and say like what is a

well it's um just the ability to draw a

4146
01:25:21,590 --> 01:25:21,600
well it's um just the ability to draw a
 

4147
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,669
well it's um just the ability to draw a
random number from

4148
01:25:23,669 --> 01:25:23,679
random number from
 

4149
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:28,790
random number from
such um from some range or to

4150
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:28,800
such um from some range or to
 

4151
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:31,030
such um from some range or to
to associate a random number with some

4152
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:31,040
to associate a random number with some
 

4153
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,149
to associate a random number with some
object

4154
01:25:32,149 --> 01:25:32,159
object
 

4155
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:35,270
object
or to draw fro at random from some set

4156
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:35,280
or to draw fro at random from some set
 

4157
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:39,030
or to draw fro at random from some set
so another

4158
01:25:39,030 --> 01:25:39,040
so another
 

4159
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:42,790
so another
example is very simple if we're

4160
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:42,800
example is very simple if we're
 

4161
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:46,390
example is very simple if we're
conducting a presidential election

4162
01:25:46,390 --> 01:25:46,400
conducting a presidential election
 

4163
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:52,229
conducting a presidential election
and we would like to pick the winner

4164
01:25:52,229 --> 01:25:52,239

 

4165
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:56,070

in principle we could draw

4166
01:25:56,070 --> 01:25:56,080
in principle we could draw
 

4167
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:58,390
in principle we could draw
a random sample of all of the voters in

4168
01:25:58,390 --> 01:25:58,400
a random sample of all of the voters in
 

4169
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,629
a random sample of all of the voters in
the country

4170
01:26:00,629 --> 01:26:00,639
the country
 

4171
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:03,750
the country
and if it was a side of substantial size

4172
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:03,760
and if it was a side of substantial size
 

4173
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,510
and if it was a side of substantial size
say a few thousand

4174
01:26:05,510 --> 01:26:05,520
say a few thousand
 

4175
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:08,390
say a few thousand
then the most popular candidate in that

4176
01:26:08,390 --> 01:26:08,400
then the most popular candidate in that
 

4177
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:09,510
then the most popular candidate in that
group would be

4178
01:26:09,510 --> 01:26:09,520
group would be
 

4179
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:12,149
group would be
very likely to be the correct choice

4180
01:26:12,149 --> 01:26:12,159
very likely to be the correct choice
 

4181
01:26:12,159 --> 01:26:13,590
very likely to be the correct choice
that would come out of counting all the

4182
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:13,600
that would come out of counting all the
 

4183
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:16,229
that would come out of counting all the
millions of votes

4184
01:26:16,229 --> 01:26:16,239
millions of votes
 

4185
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:17,990
millions of votes
of course we can't do this because first

4186
01:26:17,990 --> 01:26:18,000
of course we can't do this because first
 

4187
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,910
of course we can't do this because first
of all everybody has to feel that his or

4188
01:26:19,910 --> 01:26:19,920
of all everybody has to feel that his or
 

4189
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,750
of all everybody has to feel that his or
her vote counted

4190
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:21,760
her vote counted
 

4191
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,830
her vote counted
and secondly we can't really do a purely

4192
01:26:23,830 --> 01:26:23,840
and secondly we can't really do a purely
 

4193
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,189
and secondly we can't really do a purely
random sample

4194
01:26:25,189 --> 01:26:25,199
random sample
 

4195
01:26:25,199 --> 01:26:28,870
random sample
from that population and i guess thirdly

4196
01:26:28,870 --> 01:26:28,880
from that population and i guess thirdly
 

4197
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:29,990
from that population and i guess thirdly
there could be a tie

4198
01:26:29,990 --> 01:26:30,000
there could be a tie
 

4199
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,870
there could be a tie
in which case we wouldn't have a

4200
01:26:32,870 --> 01:26:32,880
in which case we wouldn't have a
 

4201
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:34,950
in which case we wouldn't have a
significant difference between

4202
01:26:34,950 --> 01:26:34,960
significant difference between
 

4203
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:37,669
significant difference between
two candidates but those things aside if

4204
01:26:37,669 --> 01:26:37,679
two candidates but those things aside if
 

4205
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:39,189
two candidates but those things aside if
you didn't have all that messiness of

4206
01:26:39,189 --> 01:26:39,199
you didn't have all that messiness of
 

4207

01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:42,480
you could prove that that kind of random
 

4211
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:44,070
you could prove that that kind of random
picking would be just that random

01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:05,600
i could pick any number between
 

4233
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:10,550
i could pick any number between
1 and 17 and raise it to the 16th power

4234
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:10,560
1 and 17 and raise it to the 16th power
 

4235
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:13,350
1 and 17 and raise it to the 16th power
modulo 17 and you should get back the

4236
01:27:13,350 --> 01:27:13,360
modulo 17 and you should get back the
 

4237
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:14,870

01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,390
that's a famous formula due to

01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:26,070
little theorem that
if you take any a any number a in the

01:27:26,070 --> 01:27:26,080
if you take any a any number a in the
 

4247
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:29,189
if you take any a any number a in the
range

4248
01:27:29,189 --> 01:27:29,199

 

4249
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:32,550

0 through n minus 1. and raise

4250
01:27:32,550 --> 01:27:32,560
0 through n minus 1. and raise
 

4251
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:36,070
0 through n minus 1. and raise
it to the n minus one paper uh

4252
01:27:36,070 --> 01:27:36,080
it to the n minus one paper uh
 

4253
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:38,950
it to the n minus one paper uh
power modulo n you'll get back the

4254
01:27:38,950 --> 01:27:38,960
power modulo n you'll get back the
 

4255
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:39,350
power modulo n you'll get back the

a if the number is if a is prime
 

4259
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:45,590
a if the number is if a is prime
yeah so if you don't get back the number

4260
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:45,600
yeah so if you don't get back the number
 

4261
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,669
yeah so if you don't get back the number
a that's a proof that a number is not

prime
 

4265
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:53,189
prime
well and

4266
01:27:53,189 --> 01:27:53,199
well and
 

4267
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:56,310
well and
you can show that um

4268
01:27:56,310 --> 01:27:56,320
you can show that um
 

4269
01:27:56,320 --> 01:28:00,149
you can show that um
suitably define the the

4270
01:28:00,149 --> 01:28:00,159
suitably define the the
 

4271
01:28:00,159 --> 01:28:06,790
suitably define the the
the probability that you will get

4272
01:28:06,790 --> 01:28:06,800

 

4273
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:10,790

a value unequal you will get a violation

4274
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:10,800
a value unequal you will get a violation
 

4275
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,149
a value unequal you will get a violation
of fermat's

4276
01:28:12,149 --> 01:28:12,159
of fermat's
 

4277
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:15,030
of fermat's
result is very high and so this gives

4278
01:28:15,030 --> 01:28:15,040
result is very high and so this gives
 

4279
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:17,030
result is very high and so this gives
you a way of

4280
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:17,040
you a way of
 

4281
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:19,350
you a way of
rapidly proving that a number is not

4282
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:19,360
rapidly proving that a number is not
 

4283
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:20,950
rapidly proving that a number is not

4284
01:28:20,950 --> 01:28:20,960
prime
 

4285
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:22,709
prime
it's a little more complicated than that

4286
01:28:22,709 --> 01:28:22,719
it's a little more complicated than that
 

4287
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:25,270
it's a little more complicated than that
because uh there are certain

4288
01:28:25,270 --> 01:28:25,280
because uh there are certain
 

4289
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:27,110
because uh there are certain
values of n where something a little

4290
01:28:27,110 --> 01:28:27,120
values of n where something a little
 

4291
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:28,870
values of n where something a little
more elaborate has to be done but that's

4292
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:28,880
more elaborate has to be done but that's
 

4293
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,790
more elaborate has to be done but that's
the basic idea

4294
01:28:30,790 --> 01:28:30,800
the basic idea
 

4295
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:34,229
the basic idea
using taking an identity that holds for

4296
01:28:34,229 --> 01:28:34,239
using taking an identity that holds for
 

4297
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:36,070
using taking an identity that holds for
primes and therefore

4298
01:28:36,070 --> 01:28:36,080
primes and therefore
 

4299
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:39,350
primes and therefore
if it ever fails on any instance

4300
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:39,360
if it ever fails on any instance
 

4301
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:42,149
if it ever fails on any instance
for a non-prime unit you know that the

4302
01:28:42,149 --> 01:28:42,159
for a non-prime unit you know that the
 

4303
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:43,910
for a non-prime unit you know that the
number is not prime it's a quick

4304
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:43,920
number is not prime it's a quick
 

4305
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:46,550

01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:55,110
some aspect of that algorithm that might

01:29:55,110 --> 01:29:55,120
be
 

4365
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:59,430
be
useful to describe so you you have a

01:29:59,430 --> 01:29:59,440
useful to describe so you you have a
 

4367
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:03,510
useful to describe so you you have a
a collection of

4368
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:03,520
a collection of
 

4369
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:07,669
a collection of
formulas and you want to

4370
01:30:07,669 --> 01:30:07,679
formulas and you want to
 

4371
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:10,950
formulas and you want to
count the number

4372
01:30:10,950 --> 01:30:10,960
count the number
 

4373
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:14,390
count the number
of solutions

4374
01:30:14,390 --> 01:30:14,400
of solutions
 

4375
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:18,830
of solutions
that satisfy at least one of the

4376
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:18,840
that satisfy at least one of the
 

4377
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:20,310
that satisfy at least one of the
formulas

4378
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:20,320
formulas
 

4379
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:22,709
formulas
and you can count the number of

4380
01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:22,719
and you can count the number of
 

4381
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:25,270
and you can count the number of
solutions that satisfy

4382
01:30:25,270 --> 01:30:25,280
solutions that satisfy
 

4383
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:27,350
solutions that satisfy
any particular one of the formulas but

4384
01:30:27,350 --> 01:30:27,360
any particular one of the formulas but
 

4385
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:29,110
any particular one of the formulas but
you have to account

4386
01:30:29,110 --> 01:30:29,120
you have to account
 

4387
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:32,390
you have to account
for the fact that that solution might be

4388
01:30:32,390 --> 01:30:32,400
for the fact that that solution might be
 

4389
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:36,709
for the fact that that solution might be
counted many times if it solves

4390
01:30:36,709 --> 01:30:36,719

 

4391
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:40,709

more than one of the formulas

4392
01:30:40,709 --> 01:30:40,719

 

4393
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:45,110

and so what what you do is you

4394
01:30:45,110 --> 01:30:45,120

 

4395
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,990

sample from the formulas according to

4396
01:30:47,990 --> 01:30:48,000
sample from the formulas according to
 

4397
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,790
sample from the formulas according to
the number of solutions that satisfy

4398
01:30:50,790 --> 01:30:50,800
the number of solutions that satisfy
 

4399
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:54,149
the number of solutions that satisfy
each individual one in that way you draw

4400
01:30:54,149 --> 01:30:54,159
each individual one in that way you draw
 

4401
01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:55,590
each individual one in that way you draw
a random solution

4402
01:30:55,590 --> 01:30:55,600
a random solution
 

4403
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:58,870
a random solution
but then you correct by looking at

4404
01:30:58,870 --> 01:30:58,880
but then you correct by looking at
 

4405
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:01,030
but then you correct by looking at
the number of formulas that satisfy that

4406
01:31:01,030 --> 01:31:01,040
the number of formulas that satisfy that
 

4407
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:04,390
the number of formulas that satisfy that
random solution

4408
01:31:04,390 --> 01:31:04,400

 

4409
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:08,790

and uh and don't double count

4410
01:31:08,790 --> 01:31:08,800
and uh and don't double count
 

4411
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,270
and uh and don't double count
so if if you you can think of it this

4412
01:31:11,270 --> 01:31:11,280
so if if you you can think of it this
 

4413
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:13,270
so if if you you can think of it this
way so you have a

4414
01:31:13,270 --> 01:31:13,280
way so you have a
 

4415
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:16,470
way so you have a
matrix of zeros and ones and you want to

4416
01:31:16,470 --> 01:31:16,480
matrix of zeros and ones and you want to
 

4417
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:17,189
matrix of zeros and ones and you want to
know

4418
01:31:17,189 --> 01:31:17,199
know
 

4419
01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:19,270
know
how many columns of that matrix contain

4420
01:31:19,270 --> 01:31:19,280
how many columns of that matrix contain
 

4421
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:22,310
how many columns of that matrix contain
at least one one

4422
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:22,320

 

4423
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:24,870

and you can count in each row how many

4424
01:31:24,870 --> 01:31:24,880
and you can count in each row how many
 

4425
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,790
and you can count in each row how many
ones there are

4426
01:31:26,790 --> 01:31:26,800
ones there are
 

4427
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:29,350
ones there are
so what you can do is draw from the rows

4428
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:29,360
so what you can do is draw from the rows
 

4429
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:30,550
so what you can do is draw from the rows
according to

4430
01:31:30,550 --> 01:31:30,560
according to
 

4431
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:32,470
according to
the number of ones if a row has more

4432
01:31:32,470 --> 01:31:32,480
the number of ones if a row has more
 

4433
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:33,669
the number of ones if a row has more
ones it gets to run

4434
01:31:33,669 --> 01:31:33,679
ones it gets to run
 

4435
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:37,030
ones it gets to run
more frequently but then

4436
01:31:37,030 --> 01:31:37,040
more frequently but then
 

4437
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:40,550
more frequently but then
if you draw from that row you have to go

4438
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:40,560
if you draw from that row you have to go
 

4439
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:43,270
if you draw from that row you have to go
up the column and looking at where that

4440
01:31:43,270 --> 01:31:43,280
up the column and looking at where that
 

4441
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:44,870
up the column and looking at where that
same one is repeated in

4442
01:31:44,870 --> 01:31:44,880
same one is repeated in
 

4443
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:48,229
same one is repeated in
different rows and only

4444
01:31:48,229 --> 01:31:48,239
different rows and only
 

4445
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:51,669
different rows and only
count it as a success or a hit if it's

4446
01:31:51,669 --> 01:31:51,679
count it as a success or a hit if it's
 

4447
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:52,149
count it as a success or a hit if it's
the

4448
01:31:52,149 --> 01:31:52,159
the
 

4449
01:31:52,159 --> 01:31:55,590
the
earliest row that contains the one right

4450
01:31:55,590 --> 01:31:55,600
earliest row that contains the one right
 

4451
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:58,950
earliest row that contains the one right
and that gives you a robust

4452
01:31:58,950 --> 01:31:58,960
and that gives you a robust
 

4453
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:01,189
and that gives you a robust
statistical estimate of the total number

4454
01:32:01,189 --> 01:32:01,199
statistical estimate of the total number
 

4455
01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:03,189
statistical estimate of the total number
of columns that contain at least one of

4456
01:32:03,189 --> 01:32:03,199
of columns that contain at least one of
 

4457
01:32:03,199 --> 01:32:04,470
of columns that contain at least one of
the ones

4458
01:32:04,470 --> 01:32:04,480
the ones
 

4459
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:07,990
the ones
so that that is an example of

4460
01:32:07,990 --> 01:32:08,000
so that that is an example of
 

4461
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,870
so that that is an example of
the same principle that was used in

4462
01:32:10,870 --> 01:32:10,880
the same principle that was used in
 

4463
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:13,270
the same principle that was used in
studying random sampling

4464
01:32:13,270 --> 01:32:13,280
studying random sampling
 

4465
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:17,510
studying random sampling
another viewpoint is that

4466
01:32:17,510 --> 01:32:17,520
another viewpoint is that
 

4467
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,910
another viewpoint is that
if you have a phenomenon that occurs

4468
01:32:19,910 --> 01:32:19,920
if you have a phenomenon that occurs
 

4469
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:22,470
if you have a phenomenon that occurs
almost all the time

4470
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:22,480
almost all the time
 

4471
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:26,790
almost all the time
then if you sample one of the

4472
01:32:26,790 --> 01:32:26,800
then if you sample one of the
 

4473
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:29,110
then if you sample one of the
occasions where it occurs you're most

occasions where it occurs you're most
 

4475
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:30,470
occasions where it occurs you're most
likely to

01:32:30,470 --> 01:32:30,480
likely to
 

4477
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:32,629
likely to
and you're looking for an occurrence a

4478
01:32:32,629 --> 01:32:32,639
and you're looking for an occurrence a
 

4479
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:34,790
and you're looking for an occurrence a
random occurrence is likely to work

4480
01:32:34,790 --> 01:32:34,800
random occurrence is likely to work
 

4481
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:38,390
random occurrence is likely to work
so that comes up in solving

4482
01:32:38,390 --> 01:32:38,400
so that comes up in solving
 

4483
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:42,550
so that comes up in solving
identities solving algebraic identities

4484
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:42,560
identities solving algebraic identities
 

4485
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:42,870

you

4486
01:32:42,870 --> 01:32:42,880
you
 

4487
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:45,830
you
you get um two formulas that may look

4488
01:32:45,830 --> 01:32:45,840
you get um two formulas that may look
 

4489
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,030
you get um two formulas that may look
very different you want to know if

4490
01:32:47,030 --> 01:32:47,040
very different you want to know if
 

4491
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:48,790
very different you want to know if
they're really identical

4492
01:32:48,790 --> 01:32:48,800
they're really identical
 

4493
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:51,510
they're really identical
what you can what you can do is just

4494
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:51,520
what you can what you can do is just
 

4495
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:53,590
what you can what you can do is just
pick a random value and evaluate the

4496
01:32:53,590 --> 01:32:53,600
pick a random value and evaluate the
 

4497
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,110
pick a random value and evaluate the
formulas at those two

4498
01:32:55,110 --> 01:32:55,120
formulas at those two
 

4499
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,110
formulas at those two
at that value and see if they seeing if

4500
01:32:57,110 --> 01:32:57,120
at that value and see if they seeing if
 

4501
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:58,709
at that value and see if they seeing if
they agree

4502
01:32:58,709 --> 01:32:58,719
they agree
 

4503
01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:01,830
they agree
and you depend on the fact

4504
01:33:01,830 --> 01:33:01,840
and you depend on the fact
 

4505
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:04,390
and you depend on the fact
that if the formulas are distinct then

4506
01:33:04,390 --> 01:33:04,400
that if the formulas are distinct then
 

4507
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,709
that if the formulas are distinct then
they're going to disagree a lot

4508
01:33:06,709 --> 01:33:06,719
they're going to disagree a lot
 

4509
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:08,950
they're going to disagree a lot
and so therefore a random choice will

4510
01:33:08,950 --> 01:33:08,960
and so therefore a random choice will
 

4511
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:12,629
and so therefore a random choice will
exhibit the disagreement

4512
01:33:12,629 --> 01:33:12,639

 

4513
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:14,229

if there are many ways for the two to

4514
01:33:14,229 --> 01:33:14,239
if there are many ways for the two to
 

4515
01:33:14,239 --> 01:33:16,390
if there are many ways for the two to
disagree

4516
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:16,400
disagree
 

4517
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:17,669
disagree
and you only need to find one

4518
01:33:17,669 --> 01:33:17,679
and you only need to find one
 

4519
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:20,629
and you only need to find one
disagreement then random choice is

4520
01:33:20,629 --> 01:33:20,639
disagreement then random choice is
 

4521
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:23,669
disagreement then random choice is
likely to yield it and in general so

4522
01:33:23,669 --> 01:33:23,679
likely to yield it and in general so
 

4523
01:33:23,679 --> 01:33:25,270
likely to yield it and in general so
we've just talked about randomized

4524
01:33:25,270 --> 01:33:25,280
we've just talked about randomized
 

4525
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:26,790
we've just talked about randomized
algorithms but we can look at

4526
01:33:26,790 --> 01:33:26,800
algorithms but we can look at
 

4527
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,590
algorithms but we can look at
the probabilistic analysis of algorithms

4528
01:33:29,590 --> 01:33:29,600
the probabilistic analysis of algorithms
 

4529
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:30,149
the probabilistic analysis of algorithms
and

4530
01:33:30,149 --> 01:33:30,159
and
 

4531
01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:31,669
and
that gives us an opportunity to step

4532
01:33:31,669 --> 01:33:31,679
that gives us an opportunity to step
 

4533
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:34,149
that gives us an opportunity to step
back and as we said

4534
01:33:34,149 --> 01:33:34,159
back and as we said
 

4535
01:33:34,159 --> 01:33:35,669
back and as we said
everything we've been talking about is

4536
01:33:35,669 --> 01:33:35,679
everything we've been talking about is
 

4537
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:37,910
everything we've been talking about is
worst case analysis right

4538
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:37,920
worst case analysis right
 

4539
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:41,669
worst case analysis right
could you maybe comment on

4540
01:33:41,669 --> 01:33:41,679
could you maybe comment on
 

4541
01:33:41,679 --> 01:33:44,470
could you maybe comment on
the usefulness and the power of worst

4542
01:33:44,470 --> 01:33:44,480
the usefulness and the power of worst
 

4543
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:46,229
the usefulness and the power of worst

best case analysis average case

01:33:49,270 --> 01:33:49,280
best case analysis average case
 

4547
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:52,149

probabilistic how do we think about the

4548
01:33:52,149 --> 01:33:52,159
probabilistic how do we think about the
 

4549
01:33:52,159 --> 01:33:54,070
probabilistic how do we think about the
future of theoretical computer science

4550
01:33:54,070 --> 01:33:54,080
future of theoretical computer science
 

4551
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:56,550
future of theoretical computer science
computer science

4552
01:33:56,550 --> 01:33:56,560

4553
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,310
computer science
in the kind of analysis we do of

4554
01:33:58,310 --> 01:33:58,320
in the kind of analysis we do of
 

4555
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:00,470
in the kind of analysis we do of
algorithms does worst case analysis

4556
01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:00,480
algorithms does worst case analysis
 

4557
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:01,510
algorithms does worst case analysis
still have a place

4558
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:01,520
still have a place
 

4559
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:03,750
still have a place
an important place or do we want to try

4560
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:03,760
an important place or do we want to try
 

4561
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:05,270
an important place or do we want to try
to move forward towards kind of

4562
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:05,280
to move forward towards kind of
 

4563
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:07,750
to move forward towards kind of
average case analysis yeah and what what

4564
01:34:07,750 --> 01:34:07,760
average case analysis yeah and what what
 

4565
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:09,270
average case analysis yeah and what what
are the challenges there

4566
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:09,280
are the challenges there
 

4567
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:13,110
are the challenges there
so if worst case analysis shows that

4568
01:34:13,110 --> 01:34:13,120
so if worst case analysis shows that
 

4569
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:17,110
so if worst case analysis shows that
an algorithm is always good that's fine

4570
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:17,120
an algorithm is always good that's fine
 

4571
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:21,750
an algorithm is always good that's fine
if worst case analysis uh

4572
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:21,760

 

4573
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:25,590

is used to show that the problem

4574
01:34:25,590 --> 01:34:25,600
is used to show that the problem
 

4575
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:28,950
is used to show that the problem
that the solution is not always good

4576
01:34:28,950 --> 01:34:28,960
that the solution is not always good
 

4577
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:31,110
that the solution is not always good
then you have to step back and do

4578
01:34:31,110 --> 01:34:31,120
then you have to step back and do
 

4579
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:33,590
then you have to step back and do
something else to ask how often will

4580
01:34:33,590 --> 01:34:33,600
something else to ask how often will
 

4581
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:36,870
something else to ask how often will
you get a good solution just to pause on

4582
01:34:36,870 --> 01:34:36,880
you get a good solution just to pause on
 

4583
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,070
you get a good solution just to pause on
that for a second that

4584
01:34:38,070 --> 01:34:38,080
that for a second that
 

4585
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:40,870
that for a second that
that's so beautifully put because i

4586
01:34:40,870 --> 01:34:40,880
that's so beautifully put because i
 

4587
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:43,189
that's so beautifully put because i
think we tend to judge algorithms

4588
01:34:43,189 --> 01:34:43,199
think we tend to judge algorithms
 

4589
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:45,830
think we tend to judge algorithms
we throw them in the trash the moment

4590
01:34:45,830 --> 01:34:45,840
we throw them in the trash the moment
 

4591
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:46,229
we throw them in the trash the moment
their

4592
01:34:46,229 --> 01:34:46,239
their
 

4593
01:34:46,239 --> 01:34:48,310
their
their worst case is shown to be bad

4594
01:34:48,310 --> 01:34:48,320
their worst case is shown to be bad
 

4595
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:49,430
their worst case is shown to be bad
right and and

4596
01:34:49,430 --> 01:34:49,440
right and and
 

4597
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:54,310
right and and
and that's unfortunate i think we use

4598
01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:54,320

 

4599
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:57,070

a good example is um going back to the

4600
01:34:57,070 --> 01:34:57,080
a good example is um going back to the
 

4601
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:00,070
a good example is um going back to the
satisfiability problem

4602
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:00,080
satisfiability problem
 

4603
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:02,310
satisfiability problem
there are very powerful programs called

4604
01:35:02,310 --> 01:35:02,320
there are very powerful programs called
 

4605
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:04,390
there are very powerful programs called
set solvers

4607
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:08,310
set solvers
which in practice fairly reliably

work so well that the people

01:35:36,229 --> 01:35:36,239
work so well that the people
 

4627
01:35:36,239 --> 01:35:37,830

in that discipline tend to think of

in that discipline tend to think of

01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:41,109
in that discipline tend to think of
satisfiability as an easy problem

satisfiability as an easy problem
 

4631

satisfiability as an easy problem
so in other words just

good so in other words average case

4730
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:45,119

4733
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,390

or you've also mentioned that average

4734
01:37:48,390 --> 01:37:48,400
or you've also mentioned that average

4737
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:50,950

kind of requires you to understand what

the typical cases
 

4741
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:54,310
the typical cases
typical instances and that might be

01:37:54,310 --> 01:37:54,320
typical instances and that might be
 

4743
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:56,470

really difficult that's very difficult

4744

so

4746
01:37:57,189 --> 01:37:57,199
so
 

4747
01:37:57,199 --> 01:38:01,030
so
after i did my original work on

4748
01:38:01,030 --> 01:38:01,040
after i did my original work on
 

4749
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:04,470
after i did my original work on
getting uh showing all these problems to

01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:06,550
getting uh showing all these problems to
be np complete

4752
01:38:06,550 --> 01:38:06,560

4753
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:09,669

i looked around for a way to get some

4754
01:38:09,669 --> 01:38:09,679
i looked around for a way to get some
 

4755
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:11,590

combinatorial algorithms

4758
01:38:13,750 --> 01:38:13,760
combinatorial algorithms
 

4759
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:18,390
combinatorial algorithms
and what i tried to do was to study

4760
01:38:18,390 --> 01:38:18,400

 

4761
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:22,229

problems behavior on the average or

4762
01:38:22,229 --> 01:38:22,239
problems behavior on the average or
 

4763
01:38:22,239 --> 01:38:25,270
problems behavior on the average or
with high probability but i had to make

4764
01:38:25,270 --> 01:38:25,280
with high probability but i had to make
 

4765
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:26,629
with high probability but i had to make
some assumptions about

4766
01:38:26,629 --> 01:38:26,639
some assumptions about
 

4767
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:29,830
some assumptions about
what what's the probability space what's

4768
01:38:29,830 --> 01:38:29,840
what what's the probability space what's
 

4769
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:31,350
what what's the probability space what's
the sample space what do they

4770
01:38:31,350 --> 01:38:31,360
the sample space what do they
 

4771
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:33,669
the sample space what do they
what do we mean by typical problems

4772
01:38:33,669 --> 01:38:33,679
what do we mean by typical problems
 

4773
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:35,270
what do we mean by typical problems
that's very hard to say

4774
01:38:35,270 --> 01:38:35,280
that's very hard to say
 

4775
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:38,229
that's very hard to say
so i took the easy way out and made some

4776
01:38:38,229 --> 01:38:38,239
so i took the easy way out and made some
 

4777
01:38:38,239 --> 01:38:40,470
so i took the easy way out and made some
very simplistic assumptions

4778
01:38:40,470 --> 01:38:40,480
very simplistic assumptions
 

4779
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:42,470
very simplistic assumptions
so i assumed for example that if we were

4780
01:38:42,470 --> 01:38:42,480
so i assumed for example that if we were
 

4781
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:44,310
so i assumed for example that if we were
generating a graph

4782
01:38:44,310 --> 01:38:44,320
generating a graph
 

4783
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:46,149
generating a graph
with a certain number of vertices and

4784
01:38:46,149 --> 01:38:46,159
with a certain number of vertices and
 

4785
01:38:46,159 --> 01:38:47,350
with a certain number of vertices and
edges

4786
01:38:47,350 --> 01:38:47,360
edges
 

4787
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:49,109
edges
then we would generate the graph by

4788
01:38:49,109 --> 01:38:49,119
then we would generate the graph by
 

4789
01:38:49,119 --> 01:38:51,750
then we would generate the graph by
simply choosing one edge at a time

4790
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:51,760
simply choosing one edge at a time
 

4791
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:55,189
simply choosing one edge at a time
at ran at random until we got the right

4792
01:38:55,189 --> 01:38:55,199
at ran at random until we got the right
 

4793
01:38:55,199 --> 01:38:56,709
at ran at random until we got the right
number of edges

4794
01:38:56,709 --> 01:38:56,719
number of edges
 

4795
01:38:56,719 --> 01:38:58,790
number of edges
that's that's a particular model of

4796
01:38:58,790 --> 01:38:58,800
that's that's a particular model of
 

4797
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,629
that's that's a particular model of
random graphs that has been studied

4798
01:39:00,629 --> 01:39:00,639
random graphs that has been studied
 

4799
01:39:00,639 --> 01:39:02,870
random graphs that has been studied
mathematically a lot

4800
01:39:02,870 --> 01:39:02,880
mathematically a lot
 

4801
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:05,910
mathematically a lot
and within that model i i could prove

4802
01:39:05,910 --> 01:39:05,920
and within that model i i could prove
 

4803
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:07,510
and within that model i i could prove
all kinds of wonderful things

4804

all kinds of wonderful things
 

4805
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:10,550

i and others who also worked on this
so we could show that we know

4808
01:39:14,550 --> 01:39:14,560
so we could show that we know
 

4809
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:16,629
so we could show that we know
exactly how many edges there have to be

4810
01:39:16,629 --> 01:39:16,639
exactly how many edges there have to be
 

4811
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:18,629
exactly how many edges there have to be
in order for

in order for
 

4813
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:22,070
in order for
um there be a

4814
01:39:22,070 --> 01:39:22,080
um there be a
 

4815
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:24,950
um there be a
so-called hamiltonian circuit that's a

so-called hamiltonian circuit that's a

cycle that
visits each vertex exactly once

4821
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:34,629

we know that if the number of

4822
01:39:34,629 --> 01:39:34,639
we know that if the number of
 

4823
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:37,430
we know that if the number of
edges is a little bit more than n log n

4824
01:39:37,430 --> 01:39:37,440
edges is a little bit more than n log n
 

4825
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:39,750
edges is a little bit more than n log n
where n is the number of vertices then

4826
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:39,760
where n is the number of vertices then
 

4827
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:42,709
where n is the number of vertices then
where such a cycle is very likely to

01:39:42,709 --> 01:39:42,719
where such a cycle is very likely to
 

4829
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:43,990
where such a cycle is very likely to
exist

exist
 

4831
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,910

and we can give a heuristic that will

4832
01:39:45,910 --> 01:39:45,920
and we can give a heuristic that will
 

4833
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:48,709

find it with her high probability

find it with her high probability
 

4835
01:39:48,719 --> 01:39:53,430
find it with her high probability
and we got a the community

doing it
 

4859
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:21,990
doing it
but after a while i

4860
01:40:21,990 --> 01:40:22,000
but after a while i
 

4861
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:26,310
but after a while i
concluded that um

4862
01:40:26,310 --> 01:40:26,320

 

4863
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:29,189

that it didn't have a lot of bite in

that it didn't have a lot of bite in

yeah that can okay but all right so but
 

4873
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:41,990
yeah that can okay but all right so but
is is there a way to find nice

briefly what you would say in that case

5096
01:45:25,830 --> 01:45:25,840
briefly what you would say in that case
 

5097
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:27,669
briefly what you would say in that case
is that the problem has

is that the problem has
small circuits polynomial size circuits

5101
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:35,350

now we know that if p is equal to np

now we know that if p is equal to np
 

5103
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:35,669
now we know that if p is equal to np
then

5104
01:45:35,669 --> 01:45:35,679
then
 

5105
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:38,310
then
in fact these problems will have small

01:45:38,310 --> 01:45:38,320
in fact these problems will have small

01:47:12,390 --> 01:47:12,400
yeah what we proved is that
 

5187
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:15,590
yeah what we proved is that
if that were possible then something

5188
01:47:15,590 --> 01:47:15,600
if that were possible then something
 

5189
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:17,430
if that were possible then something
strange would happen in complexity

01:47:25,510 --> 01:47:25,520
uh class which i could briefly describe
 

5197
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:26,790
uh class which i could briefly describe
um

5198
01:47:26,790 --> 01:47:26,800
um
 

5199
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:29,990
um
something strange would happen so um

5200
01:47:29,990 --> 01:47:30,000
something strange would happen so um
 

5201
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,750
something strange would happen so um
i'll take a stab at describing what i

5202
01:47:31,750 --> 01:47:31,760
i'll take a stab at describing what i
 

5203
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:33,990
i'll take a stab at describing what i
mean let's go there

5204
01:47:33,990 --> 01:47:34,000
mean let's go there
 

5205
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,590
mean let's go there
so we have to define this hierarchy

5206
01:47:37,590 --> 01:47:37,600
so we have to define this hierarchy
 

5207
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:39,030
so we have to define this hierarchy
in which the first level of the

5208
01:47:39,030 --> 01:47:39,040
in which the first level of the
 

5209
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:41,350
in which the first level of the
hierarchy is p

5210
01:47:41,350 --> 01:47:41,360
hierarchy is p
 

5211
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:44,550
hierarchy is p
and the second level is np and what is

5212
01:47:44,550 --> 01:47:44,560
and the second level is np and what is
 

5213
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:45,270
and the second level is np and what is
np

5214
01:47:45,270 --> 01:47:45,280
np
 

5215
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:48,470
np
np involves statements of the form there

5216
01:47:48,470 --> 01:47:48,480
np involves statements of the form there
 

5217
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:49,270
np involves statements of the form there
exists

5218
01:47:49,270 --> 01:47:49,280
exists
 

5219
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:53,109
exists
a something such that something holds

5220
01:47:53,109 --> 01:47:53,119
a something such that something holds
 

5221
01:47:53,119 --> 01:47:56,390
a something such that something holds
um so for example

5222
01:47:56,390 --> 01:47:56,400
um so for example
 

5223
01:47:56,400 --> 01:48:00,149
um so for example
um um there exists the coloring such

5224
01:48:00,149 --> 01:48:00,159
um um there exists the coloring such
 

5225
01:48:00,159 --> 01:48:02,830
um um there exists the coloring such
that a graph can be colored

5226
01:48:02,830 --> 01:48:02,840
that a graph can be colored
 

5227
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:06,550
that a graph can be colored
with only that number of colors

5228
01:48:06,550 --> 01:48:06,560
with only that number of colors
 

5229
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:09,109
with only that number of colors
or there exists a hamiltonian circuit

5230
01:48:09,109 --> 01:48:09,119
or there exists a hamiltonian circuit
 

5231
01:48:09,119 --> 01:48:10,790
or there exists a hamiltonian circuit
there's a statement about this graph

5232
01:48:10,790 --> 01:48:10,800
there's a statement about this graph
 

5233
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:14,229
there's a statement about this graph
yeah so so the um

5234
01:48:14,229 --> 01:48:14,239
yeah so so the um
 

5235
01:48:14,239 --> 01:48:20,149
yeah so so the um
np um

5236
01:48:20,149 --> 01:48:20,159

 

5237
01:48:20,159 --> 01:48:22,790

nnp deals with statements of that kind

5238
01:48:22,790 --> 01:48:22,800
nnp deals with statements of that kind
 

5239
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:26,229
nnp deals with statements of that kind
that there exists a solution

5240
01:48:26,229 --> 01:48:26,239
that there exists a solution
 

5241
01:48:26,239 --> 01:48:31,270
that there exists a solution
now you could imagine a more complicated

5242
01:48:31,270 --> 01:48:31,280
now you could imagine a more complicated
 

5243
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:35,430
now you could imagine a more complicated
expression which which says um

5244
01:48:35,430 --> 01:48:35,440
expression which which says um
 

5245
01:48:35,440 --> 01:48:38,709
expression which which says um
uh for all x there exists a y

5246
01:48:38,709 --> 01:48:38,719
uh for all x there exists a y
 

5247
01:48:38,719 --> 01:48:43,030
uh for all x there exists a y
such that some uh

5248
01:48:43,030 --> 01:48:43,040
such that some uh
 

5249
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:47,270
such that some uh
proposition holds involving both x and y

5250
01:48:47,270 --> 01:48:47,280
proposition holds involving both x and y
 

5251
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:49,669
proposition holds involving both x and y
so that would say for example in game

5252
01:48:49,669 --> 01:48:49,679
so that would say for example in game
 

5253
01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:53,189
so that would say for example in game
theory for all

5254
01:48:53,189 --> 01:48:53,199

01:48:53,199 --> 01:48:55,189

strategies for the first player there

5256
01:48:55,189 --> 01:48:55,199
strategies for the first player there
 

5257
01:48:55,199 --> 01:48:57,750
strategies for the first player there
exists a strategy for the second player

5258
01:48:57,750 --> 01:48:57,760
exists a strategy for the second player
 

5259
01:48:57,760 --> 01:48:59,669
exists a strategy for the second player
such that the first player wins that

5260
01:48:59,669 --> 01:48:59,679
such that the first player wins that
 

5261
01:48:59,679 --> 01:49:01,830
such that the first player wins that
would be that would be at the second

5262
01:49:01,830 --> 01:49:01,840
would be that would be at the second
 

5263
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:03,270
would be that would be at the second
level of the hierarchy

5264
01:49:03,270 --> 01:49:03,280
level of the hierarchy
 

5265
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:05,830
level of the hierarchy
the third level would be there exists an

5266
01:49:05,830 --> 01:49:05,840
the third level would be there exists an
 

5267
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:08,390
the third level would be there exists an
a such that for all b there exists a c

a such that for all b there exists a c
 

5269
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:09,990
a such that for all b there exists a c
that something holds and you can imagine

5270
01:49:09,990 --> 01:49:10,000
that something holds and you can imagine
 

5271
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,629
that something holds and you can imagine
going higher and higher in the hierarchy

5272
01:49:12,629 --> 01:49:12,639
going higher and higher in the hierarchy
 

5273
01:49:12,639 --> 01:49:15,109
going higher and higher in the hierarchy
and you'd expect that the class the

5274
01:49:15,109 --> 01:49:15,119
and you'd expect that the class the
 

5275
01:49:15,119 --> 01:49:17,510

that correspond to those
 

5279
01:49:21,119 --> 01:49:24,310
that correspond to those
different cases would get

01:49:24,310 --> 01:49:24,320
different cases would get
 

5281
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:32,390
different cases would get
bigger and bigger or they they

01:49:50,719 --> 01:49:53,030
complicating your expressions with three
quantifiers or four quantifiers or any

5300
01:49:53,030 --> 01:49:53,040
quantifiers or four quantifiers or any
 

5301
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:55,430
quantifiers or four quantifiers or any
number

5302
01:49:55,430 --> 01:49:55,440

 

5303
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:56,950

i'm not sure what to make of that

5304
01:49:56,950 --> 01:49:56,960
i'm not sure what to make of that
 

5305
01:49:56,960 --> 01:49:58,790
i'm not sure what to make of that
exactly well i think it would be

5306
01:49:58,790 --> 01:49:58,800
exactly well i think it would be
 

5307
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:00,229
exactly well i think it would be
evidence that

5308
01:50:00,229 --> 01:50:00,239
evidence that
 

5309
01:50:00,239 --> 01:50:02,950
evidence that
and np doesn't have small circuits

5310
01:50:02,950 --> 01:50:02,960
and np doesn't have small circuits
 

5311
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:03,589
and np doesn't have small circuits
because

5312
01:50:03,589 --> 01:50:03,599
because
 

5313
01:50:03,599 --> 01:50:05,910
because
something because something so bizarre

5314
01:50:05,910 --> 01:50:05,920
something because something so bizarre
 

5315
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:07,109
something because something so bizarre
would happen

5316
01:50:07,109 --> 01:50:07,119
would happen
 

5317
01:50:07,119 --> 01:50:09,109
would happen
but again it's only evidence not proof

5318
01:50:09,109 --> 01:50:09,119
but again it's only evidence not proof
 

5319
01:50:09,119 --> 01:50:10,629
but again it's only evidence not proof
well yeah

5320
01:50:10,629 --> 01:50:10,639
well yeah
 

5321
01:50:10,639 --> 01:50:12,629
well yeah
it's not that's not even evidence

5322
01:50:12,629 --> 01:50:12,639
it's not that's not even evidence
 

5323
01:50:12,639 --> 01:50:13,750
it's not that's not even evidence
because

5324
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:13,760
because
 

5325
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:17,109
because
you're saying p is not equal to np

5326
01:50:17,109 --> 01:50:17,119
you're saying p is not equal to np
 

5327
01:50:17,119 --> 01:50:19,589
you're saying p is not equal to np
because something bizarre has to happen

5328
01:50:19,589 --> 01:50:19,599
because something bizarre has to happen
 

5329
01:50:19,599 --> 01:50:20,229
because something bizarre has to happen
i mean

5330
01:50:20,229 --> 01:50:20,239
i mean
 

5331
01:50:20,239 --> 01:50:23,830
i mean
there that's uh that's proved by the

5332
01:50:23,830 --> 01:50:23,840
there that's uh that's proved by the
 

5333
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:25,189
there that's uh that's proved by the
lack of bizarreness

5334
01:50:25,189 --> 01:50:25,199
lack of bizarreness
 

5335
01:50:25,199 --> 01:50:28,870
lack of bizarreness
in in our science but it seems like

5336
01:50:28,870 --> 01:50:28,880
in in our science but it seems like
 

5337
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:31,510
in in our science but it seems like
um it seems like just the very notion of

5338
01:50:31,510 --> 01:50:31,520
um it seems like just the very notion of
 

5339
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:33,910
um it seems like just the very notion of
p equals np would be bizarre so any way

5340
01:50:33,910 --> 01:50:33,920
p equals np would be bizarre so any way
 

5341
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:35,030
p equals np would be bizarre so any way
you arrive at

5342
01:50:35,030 --> 01:50:35,040
you arrive at
 

5343
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:37,109
you arrive at
there's no way you have to fight the

5344
01:50:37,109 --> 01:50:37,119
there's no way you have to fight the
 

5345
01:50:37,119 --> 01:50:38,550
there's no way you have to fight the
dragon at some point

5346
01:50:38,550 --> 01:50:38,560
dragon at some point
 

5347
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:41,589
dragon at some point
yeah okay well anyway for whatever it's

5348
01:50:41,589 --> 01:50:41,599
yeah okay well anyway for whatever it's
 

5349
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:42,310
yeah okay well anyway for whatever it's
worth that's

5350
01:50:42,310 --> 01:50:42,320
worth that's
 

5351
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:45,750
worth that's
what we proved awesome so

5352
01:50:45,750 --> 01:50:45,760
what we proved awesome so
 

5353
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:48,149
what we proved awesome so
so that's a potential space of open

5354
01:50:48,149 --> 01:50:48,159
so that's a potential space of open
 

5355
01:50:48,159 --> 01:50:49,430
so that's a potential space of open
interesting problems

5356

interesting problems
 

5357
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:52,950
interesting problems
yeah let me ask you about the this other

5358
01:50:52,950 --> 01:50:52,960
yeah let me ask you about the this other
 

5359
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:54,229
yeah let me ask you about the this other
world

um but we don't

01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:09,430
have any theoretical understanding of
why that's true

5466
01:53:09,430 --> 01:53:09,440

 

5467
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:12,629

secondly the solutions the the networks

5468
01:53:12,629 --> 01:53:12,639
secondly the solutions the the networks
 

5469
01:53:12,639 --> 01:53:14,470
secondly the solutions the the networks
that you get

5470
01:53:14,470 --> 01:53:14,480
that you get
 

5471
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:16,950
that you get
uh are very hard to understand and so

5472
01:53:16,950 --> 01:53:16,960
uh are very hard to understand and so
 

5473
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:19,990
uh are very hard to understand and so
very little insight comes out

5474
01:53:19,990 --> 01:53:20,000
very little insight comes out
 

5475
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,229
very little insight comes out
so yeah yeah they may seem to work on

5476
01:53:22,229 --> 01:53:22,239
so yeah yeah they may seem to work on
 

5477
01:53:22,239 --> 01:53:23,910
so yeah yeah they may seem to work on
your training set

5478
01:53:23,910 --> 01:53:23,920
your training set
 

5479
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:27,109
your training set
and you may be able to discover

5480
01:53:27,109 --> 01:53:27,119
and you may be able to discover
 

5481
01:53:27,119 --> 01:53:30,629
and you may be able to discover
whether your photos occur in a

5482
01:53:30,629 --> 01:53:30,639
whether your photos occur in a
 

5483
01:53:30,639 --> 01:53:34,870
whether your photos occur in a
different sample of inputs or not

5484
01:53:34,870 --> 01:53:34,880
different sample of inputs or not
 

5485
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:37,189
different sample of inputs or not
um but we don't really know what's going

5486
01:53:37,189 --> 01:53:37,199
um but we don't really know what's going
 

5487
01:53:37,199 --> 01:53:38,550
um but we don't really know what's going
on we don't know the

5488
01:53:38,550 --> 01:53:38,560
on we don't know the
 

5489
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:40,790
on we don't know the
the features that distinguish the

5490
01:53:40,790 --> 01:53:40,800
the features that distinguish the
 

5491
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:43,669
the features that distinguish the
photographs or the objects are

5492
01:53:43,669 --> 01:53:43,679
photographs or the objects are
 

5493
01:53:43,679 --> 01:53:49,430
photographs or the objects are
are um not easy to characterize

5494
01:53:49,430 --> 01:53:49,440

 

5495
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:50,550

well it's interesting because you

5496
01:53:50,550 --> 01:53:50,560
well it's interesting because you
 

5497
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:53,270
well it's interesting because you
mentioned coming up with a small circuit

5498
01:53:53,270 --> 01:53:53,280
mentioned coming up with a small circuit
 

5499
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:56,070
mentioned coming up with a small circuit
yeah to solve a particular size problem

5500
01:53:56,070 --> 01:53:56,080
yeah to solve a particular size problem
 

5501
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:57,669
yeah to solve a particular size problem
yeah it seems that neural networks are

5502
01:53:57,669 --> 01:53:57,679
yeah it seems that neural networks are
 

5503
01:53:57,679 --> 01:53:58,550
yeah it seems that neural networks are
kind of

5504
01:53:58,550 --> 01:53:58,560
kind of
 

5505
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:01,430
kind of
small circuits in a way yeah uh but

5506
01:54:01,430 --> 01:54:01,440
small circuits in a way yeah uh but
 

5507
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:02,709
small circuits in a way yeah uh but
they're not programs

5508
01:54:02,709 --> 01:54:02,719
they're not programs
 

5509
01:54:02,719 --> 01:54:04,470
they're not programs
sort of like the the things you've

5510
01:54:04,470 --> 01:54:04,480
sort of like the the things you've
 

5511
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:06,550
sort of like the the things you've
designed are algorithms programs

5512
01:54:06,550 --> 01:54:06,560
designed are algorithms programs
 

5513
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:09,830
designed are algorithms programs
right algorithms neural networks aren't

5514
01:54:09,830 --> 01:54:09,840
right algorithms neural networks aren't
 

5515
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:10,470
right algorithms neural networks aren't
able to

5516
01:54:10,470 --> 01:54:10,480
able to
 

5517
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:13,990
able to
develop algorithms to solve a problem

5518
01:54:13,990 --> 01:54:14,000
develop algorithms to solve a problem
 

5519
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,750
develop algorithms to solve a problem
is it well they are more of a function

5520
01:54:15,750 --> 01:54:15,760
is it well they are more of a function
 

5521
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:17,350
is it well they are more of a function
they are algorithms it's just

5522
01:54:17,350 --> 01:54:17,360
they are algorithms it's just
 

5523
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:20,790
they are algorithms it's just
that they're uh but

5524
01:54:20,790 --> 01:54:20,800
that they're uh but
 

5525
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:24,149
that they're uh but
sort of uh well yeah it's a it could be

5526
01:54:24,149 --> 01:54:24,159
sort of uh well yeah it's a it could be
 

5527
01:54:24,159 --> 01:54:25,669
sort of uh well yeah it's a it could be
a semantic question but

5528
01:54:25,669 --> 01:54:25,679
a semantic question but
 

5529
01:54:25,679 --> 01:54:29,910
a semantic question but
there's not a algorithmic style

5530
01:54:29,910 --> 01:54:29,920
there's not a algorithmic style
 

5531
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:31,030
there's not a algorithmic style
manipulation

5532
01:54:31,030 --> 01:54:31,040
manipulation
 

5533
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:34,229
manipulation
of the input perhaps you could argue

5534
01:54:34,229 --> 01:54:34,239
of the input perhaps you could argue
 

5535
01:54:34,239 --> 01:54:35,350
of the input perhaps you could argue
there is

5536
01:54:35,350 --> 01:54:35,360
there is
 

5537
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:38,709
there is
yeah well it feels a lot more like a

5538
01:54:38,709 --> 01:54:38,719
yeah well it feels a lot more like a
 

5539
01:54:38,719 --> 01:54:39,430
yeah well it feels a lot more like a
function

5540
01:54:39,430 --> 01:54:39,440
function
 

5541
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:41,669
function
of the input it's a yeah it's a function

5542
01:54:41,669 --> 01:54:41,679
of the input it's a yeah it's a function
 

5543
01:54:41,679 --> 01:54:43,430
of the input it's a yeah it's a function
it's a computable function

5544
01:54:43,430 --> 01:54:43,440
it's a computable function
 

5545
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:46,070
it's a computable function
it's um once you have the network you

5546
01:54:46,070 --> 01:54:46,080
it's um once you have the network you
 

5547
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:47,589
it's um once you have the network you
can

5548
01:54:47,589 --> 01:54:47,599
can
 

5549
01:54:47,599 --> 01:54:49,750
can
simulate it on a given input and figure

5550
01:54:49,750 --> 01:54:49,760
simulate it on a given input and figure
 

5551
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:51,109
simulate it on a given input and figure
out the output

5552
01:54:51,109 --> 01:54:51,119
out the output
 

5553
01:54:51,119 --> 01:54:53,189
out the output
but what you you know if you're if

5554
01:54:53,189 --> 01:54:53,199
but what you you know if you're if
 

5555
01:54:53,199 --> 01:54:55,750
but what you you know if you're if
you're trying to recognize

5556
01:54:55,750 --> 01:54:55,760
you're trying to recognize
 

5557
01:54:55,760 --> 01:55:00,149
you're trying to recognize
images then you don't know what features

5558
01:55:00,149 --> 01:55:00,159
images then you don't know what features
 

5559
01:55:00,159 --> 01:55:02,870
images then you don't know what features
of the image are really

5560
01:55:02,870 --> 01:55:02,880
of the image are really
 

5561
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:06,470
of the image are really
being uh uh

01:55:08,950 --> 01:55:08,960
determinant of of what the circuit is
 

5565
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:11,270
determinant of of what the circuit is
doing the circuit is

5566
01:55:11,270 --> 01:55:11,280
doing the circuit is
 

5567
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:14,629
doing the circuit is
sort of a very intricate and

5568
01:55:14,629 --> 01:55:14,639
sort of a very intricate and
 

5569
01:55:14,639 --> 01:55:17,990
sort of a very intricate and
you know it's not clear that the the

5570
01:55:17,990 --> 01:55:18,000
you know it's not clear that the the
 

5571
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,870
you know it's not clear that the the
you know the the simple characteristics

01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:22,229
you know the the simple characteristics
that you're looking for the

01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:28,550
they may be
they're not emerging from the structure

of the circuit
 

5583
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:31,109
of the circuit
well it's not clear to us humans but

5584
01:55:31,109 --> 01:55:31,119
well it's not clear to us humans but
 

5585
01:55:31,119 --> 01:55:32,950
well it's not clear to us humans but
it's clear to the circuit

5586
01:55:32,950 --> 01:55:32,960
it's clear to the circuit
 

5587
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:37,109
it's clear to the circuit
yeah well right i mean uh

5588
01:55:37,109 --> 01:55:37,119
yeah well right i mean uh
 

5589
01:55:37,119 --> 01:55:41,270
yeah well right i mean uh
it's not clear to sort of the um

5590
01:55:41,270 --> 01:55:41,280
it's not clear to sort of the um
 

5591
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:44,470
it's not clear to sort of the um
the elephant how the human brain works

5592
01:55:44,470 --> 01:55:44,480
the elephant how the human brain works
 

5593
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:47,030
the elephant how the human brain works
but it's clear to us humans we can

5594
01:55:47,030 --> 01:55:47,040
but it's clear to us humans we can
 

5595
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:48,229
but it's clear to us humans we can
explain to each other

5596
01:55:48,229 --> 01:55:48,239
explain to each other
 

5597
01:55:48,239 --> 01:55:49,910
explain to each other
our reasoning and that's why the

5598
01:55:49,910 --> 01:55:49,920
our reasoning and that's why the
 

5599
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:51,510
our reasoning and that's why the
cognitive science the psychology field

5600
01:55:51,510 --> 01:55:51,520
cognitive science the psychology field
 

5601
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:52,629
cognitive science the psychology field
exists

5602
01:55:52,629 --> 01:55:52,639
exists
 

5603
01:55:52,639 --> 01:55:55,030
exists
maybe maybe the whole thing of being

5604
01:55:55,030 --> 01:55:55,040
maybe maybe the whole thing of being
 

5605
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:56,790
maybe maybe the whole thing of being
explainable to humans is a little bit

5606
01:55:56,790 --> 01:55:56,800
explainable to humans is a little bit
 

5607
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:57,589
explainable to humans is a little bit
overrated

5608
01:55:57,589 --> 01:55:57,599
overrated
 

5609
01:55:57,599 --> 01:56:00,709
overrated
well maybe yeah i guess i you know you

5610
01:56:00,709 --> 01:56:00,719
well maybe yeah i guess i you know you
 

5611
01:56:00,719 --> 01:56:02,390
well maybe yeah i guess i you know you
could say the same thing about our brain

5612
01:56:02,390 --> 01:56:02,400
could say the same thing about our brain
 

5613
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:03,109
could say the same thing about our brain
that

5614
01:56:03,109 --> 01:56:03,119
that
 

5615
01:56:03,119 --> 01:56:06,229
that
when we perform acts of cognition we

5616
01:56:06,229 --> 01:56:06,239
when we perform acts of cognition we
 

5617
01:56:06,239 --> 01:56:08,870
when we perform acts of cognition we
have no idea how we do it really

5618
01:56:08,870 --> 01:56:08,880
have no idea how we do it really
 

5619
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:11,990
have no idea how we do it really
we do though i mean we for

5620
01:56:11,990 --> 01:56:12,000
we do though i mean we for
 

5621
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,669
we do though i mean we for
at least for the visual system the

5622
01:56:13,669 --> 01:56:13,679
at least for the visual system the
 

5623
01:56:13,679 --> 01:56:17,030
at least for the visual system the
auditory system and so on we do

5624
01:56:17,030 --> 01:56:17,040
auditory system and so on we do
 

5625
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:19,189
auditory system and so on we do
get some understanding of the principles

5626
01:56:19,189 --> 01:56:19,199
get some understanding of the principles
 

5627
01:56:19,199 --> 01:56:21,589
get some understanding of the principles
that they operate under but

5628
01:56:21,589 --> 01:56:21,599
that they operate under but
 

5629
01:56:21,599 --> 01:56:24,629
that they operate under but
uh for many deeper cognitive tasks we

5630
01:56:24,629 --> 01:56:24,639
uh for many deeper cognitive tasks we
 

5631
01:56:24,639 --> 01:56:25,510
uh for many deeper cognitive tasks we
don't have that

5632
01:56:25,510 --> 01:56:25,520
don't have that
 

5633
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:28,550
don't have that
that's right so let me ask yeah

5634
01:56:28,550 --> 01:56:28,560
that's right so let me ask yeah
 

5635
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:31,189
that's right so let me ask yeah
you've also been doing work on

5636
01:56:31,189 --> 01:56:31,199
you've also been doing work on
 

5637
01:56:31,199 --> 01:56:33,030
you've also been doing work on
bioinformatics

5638
01:56:33,030 --> 01:56:33,040
bioinformatics
 

5639
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:35,589
bioinformatics
does it amaze you that the fundamental

5640
01:56:35,589 --> 01:56:35,599
does it amaze you that the fundamental
 

5641
01:56:35,599 --> 01:56:36,790
does it amaze you that the fundamental
building blocks

5642
01:56:36,790 --> 01:56:36,800
building blocks
 

5643
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:38,629
building blocks
so if we take a step back and look at us

5644
01:56:38,629 --> 01:56:38,639
so if we take a step back and look at us
 

5645
01:56:38,639 --> 01:56:39,910
so if we take a step back and look at us
humans

5646
01:56:39,910 --> 01:56:39,920
humans
 

5647
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:41,830
humans
the building blocks used by evolution to

5648
01:56:41,830 --> 01:56:41,840
the building blocks used by evolution to
 

5649
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:43,510
the building blocks used by evolution to
build us intelligent

5650
01:56:43,510 --> 01:56:43,520
build us intelligent
 

5651
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:46,149
build us intelligent
human beings is all contained there in

5652
01:56:46,149 --> 01:56:46,159
human beings is all contained there in
 

5653
01:56:46,159 --> 01:56:48,310
human beings is all contained there in
our dna

5654
01:56:48,310 --> 01:56:48,320
our dna
 

5655
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:50,310
our dna
it's amazing and and what's really

5656
01:56:50,310 --> 01:56:50,320
it's amazing and and what's really
 

5657
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:51,830
it's amazing and and what's really
amazing

5658
01:56:51,830 --> 01:56:51,840
amazing
 

5659
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:55,030
amazing
is that we have are beginning

5660
01:56:55,030 --> 01:56:55,040
is that we have are beginning
 

5661
01:56:55,040 --> 01:56:59,430
is that we have are beginning
to learn how to edit

5662
01:56:59,430 --> 01:56:59,440
to learn how to edit
 

5663
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:02,790
to learn how to edit
dna which which is very

5664
01:57:02,790 --> 01:57:02,800
dna which which is very
 

5665
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:09,589
dna which which is very
very very fascinating this

5666
01:57:09,589 --> 01:57:09,599

 

5667
01:57:09,599 --> 01:57:13,910

this ability to

5668
01:57:13,910 --> 01:57:13,920

 

5669
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:16,550

take a sequence find it in the genome

5670
01:57:16,550 --> 01:57:16,560
take a sequence find it in the genome
 

5671
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:17,350
take a sequence find it in the genome
and

5672
01:57:17,350 --> 01:57:17,360
and
 

5673
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:19,589
and
do something to it i mean that's really

5674
01:57:19,589 --> 01:57:19,599
do something to it i mean that's really
 

5675
01:57:19,599 --> 01:57:21,510
do something to it i mean that's really
taking our biological systems towards

5676
01:57:21,510 --> 01:57:21,520
taking our biological systems towards
 

5677
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:23,350
taking our biological systems towards
the worlds of algorithm

5678
01:57:23,350 --> 01:57:23,360
the worlds of algorithm
 

5679
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:26,070
the worlds of algorithm
of algorithms yeah but it raises a lot

5680
01:57:26,070 --> 01:57:26,080
of algorithms yeah but it raises a lot
 

5681
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:28,070
of algorithms yeah but it raises a lot
of questions

5682
01:57:28,070 --> 01:57:28,080
of questions
 

5683
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:31,750
of questions
um you have to distinguish between doing

5684
01:57:31,750 --> 01:57:31,760
um you have to distinguish between doing
 

5685
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:33,750
um you have to distinguish between doing
it on an individual

5686
01:57:33,750 --> 01:57:33,760
it on an individual
 

5687
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:35,669
it on an individual
or doing it on somebody's germ line

5688
01:57:35,669 --> 01:57:35,679
or doing it on somebody's germ line
 

5689
01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:37,109
or doing it on somebody's germ line
which means that all of the

5690
01:57:37,109 --> 01:57:37,119
which means that all of the
 

5691
01:57:37,119 --> 01:57:40,229
which means that all of the
descendants will be affected

5692
01:57:40,229 --> 01:57:40,239
descendants will be affected
 

5693
01:57:40,239 --> 01:57:42,709
descendants will be affected
so that's like an ethical yeah so it

5694
01:57:42,709 --> 01:57:42,719
so that's like an ethical yeah so it
 

5695
01:57:42,719 --> 01:57:44,629
so that's like an ethical yeah so it
raises very severe

5696
01:57:44,629 --> 01:57:44,639
raises very severe
 

5697
01:57:44,639 --> 01:57:50,390
raises very severe
ethical questions and um

5698
01:57:50,390 --> 01:57:50,400

 

5699
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:53,669

and even doing it on individuals

5700
01:57:53,669 --> 01:57:53,679
and even doing it on individuals
 

5701
01:57:53,679 --> 01:57:57,589
and even doing it on individuals
um is uh so there's a lot of

5702
01:57:57,589 --> 01:57:57,599
um is uh so there's a lot of
 

5703
01:57:57,599 --> 01:58:02,550
um is uh so there's a lot of
hubris involved that you can assume that

5704
01:58:02,550 --> 01:58:02,560
hubris involved that you can assume that
 

5705
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:04,470
hubris involved that you can assume that
knocking out a particular gene is going

5706
01:58:04,470 --> 01:58:04,480
knocking out a particular gene is going
 

5707
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:05,990
knocking out a particular gene is going
to be beneficial because you don't know

5708
01:58:05,990 --> 01:58:06,000
to be beneficial because you don't know
 

5709
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,950
to be beneficial because you don't know
what the side effects are going to be

5710
01:58:08,950 --> 01:58:08,960
what the side effects are going to be
 

5711
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:12,229
what the side effects are going to be
so we have this

5712
01:58:12,229 --> 01:58:12,239
so we have this
 

5713
01:58:12,239 --> 01:58:16,149
so we have this
wonderful new world

5714
01:58:16,149 --> 01:58:16,159
wonderful new world
 

5715
01:58:16,159 --> 01:58:19,189
wonderful new world
of gene editing

5716
01:58:19,189 --> 01:58:19,199
of gene editing
 

5717
01:58:19,199 --> 01:58:22,550
of gene editing
uh which is you know very very

5718
01:58:22,550 --> 01:58:22,560
uh which is you know very very
 

5719
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:26,310
uh which is you know very very
impressive and it it could be used in

5720
01:58:26,310 --> 01:58:26,320
impressive and it it could be used in
 

5721
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:29,510
impressive and it it could be used in
agriculture it could be used in

5722
01:58:29,510 --> 01:58:29,520
agriculture it could be used in
 

5723
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:32,550
agriculture it could be used in
medicine in various ways um

5724
01:58:32,550 --> 01:58:32,560
medicine in various ways um
 

5725
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:37,430
medicine in various ways um
but very serious ethical problems arise

5726
01:58:37,430 --> 01:58:37,440

 

5727
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:39,350

what are to you the most interesting

5728
01:58:39,350 --> 01:58:39,360
what are to you the most interesting
 

5729
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:42,790
what are to you the most interesting
places where algorithms

5730
01:58:42,790 --> 01:58:42,800
places where algorithms
 

5731
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:44,709
places where algorithms
sort of the ethical side is an

5732
01:58:44,709 --> 01:58:44,719
sort of the ethical side is an
 

5733
01:58:44,719 --> 01:58:46,229
sort of the ethical side is an
exceptionally challenging thing that i

5734
01:58:46,229 --> 01:58:46,239
exceptionally challenging thing that i
 

5735
01:58:46,239 --> 01:58:46,790
exceptionally challenging thing that i
think

5736
01:58:46,790 --> 01:58:46,800
think
 

5737
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:48,790
think
we're going to have to tackle with all

5738
01:58:48,790 --> 01:58:48,800
we're going to have to tackle with all
 

5739
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:49,990
we're going to have to tackle with all
of uh

5740
01:58:49,990 --> 01:58:50,000
of uh
 

5741
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,629
of uh
genetic engineering but on the

5742
01:58:52,629 --> 01:58:52,639
genetic engineering but on the
 

5743
01:58:52,639 --> 01:58:54,149
genetic engineering but on the
algorithmic side there's a lot of

5744
01:58:54,149 --> 01:58:54,159
algorithmic side there's a lot of
 

5745
01:58:54,159 --> 01:58:55,430
algorithmic side there's a lot of
benefit that's possible

5746
01:58:55,430 --> 01:58:55,440
benefit that's possible
 

5747
01:58:55,440 --> 01:58:59,189
benefit that's possible
so is there uh areas where you see

5748
01:58:59,189 --> 01:58:59,199
so is there uh areas where you see
 

5749
01:58:59,199 --> 01:59:01,109
so is there uh areas where you see
exciting possibilities for algorithms to

5750
01:59:01,109 --> 01:59:01,119
exciting possibilities for algorithms to
 

5751
01:59:01,119 --> 01:59:02,629
exciting possibilities for algorithms to
help model

5752
01:59:02,629 --> 01:59:02,639
help model
 

5753
01:59:02,639 --> 01:59:06,709
help model
optimize study biological systems

5754
01:59:06,709 --> 01:59:06,719
optimize study biological systems
 

5755
01:59:06,719 --> 01:59:10,550
optimize study biological systems
yeah i mean we we can certainly

5756
01:59:10,550 --> 01:59:10,560
yeah i mean we we can certainly
 

5757
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:15,350
yeah i mean we we can certainly
analyze genomic data to figure out

5758
01:59:15,350 --> 01:59:15,360

 

5759
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:17,350

which genes are operative in the cell

5760
01:59:17,350 --> 01:59:17,360
which genes are operative in the cell
 

5761
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:19,109
which genes are operative in the cell
and under what conditions and

5762
01:59:19,109 --> 01:59:19,119
and under what conditions and
 

5763
01:59:19,119 --> 01:59:22,070
and under what conditions and
which proteins affect one another uh

5764
01:59:22,070 --> 01:59:22,080
which proteins affect one another uh
 

5765
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:23,030
which proteins affect one another uh
which prote

5766
01:59:23,030 --> 01:59:23,040
which prote
 

5767
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:27,270
which prote
which proteins physically interact um

5768
01:59:27,270 --> 01:59:27,280
which proteins physically interact um
 

5769
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:31,030
which proteins physically interact um
we can sequence proteins and modify them

5770
01:59:31,030 --> 01:59:31,040
we can sequence proteins and modify them
 

5771
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:33,990
we can sequence proteins and modify them
um is there some aspect of that that's a

5772
01:59:33,990 --> 01:59:34,000
um is there some aspect of that that's a
 

5773
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,750
um is there some aspect of that that's a
computer science problem

5774
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:35,760
computer science problem
 

5775
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:38,709
computer science problem
or is that still fundamentally a biology

5776
01:59:38,709 --> 01:59:38,719
or is that still fundamentally a biology
 

5777
01:59:38,719 --> 01:59:39,750

01:59:48,070 --> 01:59:48,080
sure so you know the biological data
 

5785
01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:53,189
sure so you know the biological data
sets are increasing our ability to

just need an ear and now and then

so you have to
 

6019
02:04:59,199 --> 02:05:01,990
so you have to
have to deal with each student as a

have to deal with each student as a

humans are complicated yeah perhaps a

humans are complicated yeah perhaps a
 

6027
02:05:09,599 --> 02:05:11,189
humans are complicated yeah perhaps a
silly question

silly question
 

6029
02:05:11,199 --> 02:05:13,350
silly question
if you could relive a moment in your

if you could relive a moment in your
 

6031
02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:15,270
if you could relive a moment in your
life outside of family

life outside of family
 

6033
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:17,510

because it made you truly happy or
 

6035
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:19,189
because it made you truly happy or
perhaps because it changed the direction

6036
02:05:19,189 --> 02:05:19,199
perhaps because it changed the direction
 

6037
02:05:19,199 --> 02:05:21,910
perhaps because it changed the direction
of your life in a profound way

6038
02:05:21,910 --> 02:05:21,920
of your life in a profound way
 

6039
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:25,189

what moment would you pick i was kind of

6040
02:05:25,189 --> 02:05:25,199
what moment would you pick i was kind of
 

6041
02:05:25,199 --> 02:05:26,709
what moment would you pick i was kind of
a lazy student

a lazy student
 

6043
02:05:26,719 --> 02:05:30,870
a lazy student
as an undergraduate and even in my first

6044
02:05:30,870 --> 02:05:30,880
as an undergraduate and even in my first
 

6045
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:34,069
as an undergraduate and even in my first
year in graduate school and

6046
02:05:34,069 --> 02:05:34,079
year in graduate school and
 

6047
02:05:34,079 --> 02:05:35,589
year in graduate school and
i think it was when i started doing

6048
02:05:35,589 --> 02:05:35,599
i think it was when i started doing
 

6049
02:05:35,599 --> 02:05:37,189
i think it was when i started doing
research

6050
02:05:37,189 --> 02:05:37,199
research
 

6051
02:05:37,199 --> 02:05:39,189
research
i had a couple of summer jobs where i

6052
02:05:39,189 --> 02:05:39,199
i had a couple of summer jobs where i
 

6053
02:05:39,199 --> 02:05:41,510
i had a couple of summer jobs where i
was able to contribute

6054
02:05:41,510 --> 02:05:41,520
was able to contribute
 

6055
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:45,030
was able to contribute
and i had an idea

6056
02:05:45,030 --> 02:05:45,040
and i had an idea
 

6057
02:05:45,040 --> 02:05:47,669
and i had an idea
and then there was one particular course

6058
02:05:47,669 --> 02:05:47,679
and then there was one particular course
 

6059
02:05:47,679 --> 02:05:49,669
and then there was one particular course
on mathematical methods in operations

6060
02:05:49,669 --> 02:05:49,679
on mathematical methods in operations
 

6061

research
 

6063
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:53,669
research
where i just gobbled up the material and

6064
02:05:53,669 --> 02:05:53,679
where i just gobbled up the material and
 

6065
02:05:53,679 --> 02:05:55,750
where i just gobbled up the material and
i scored 20 points higher than

6066
02:05:55,750 --> 02:05:55,760
i scored 20 points higher than
 

6067
02:05:55,760 --> 02:05:58,310
i scored 20 points higher than
anybody else in the class then came to

6068
02:05:58,310 --> 02:05:58,320
anybody else in the class then came to
 

6069
02:05:58,320 --> 02:06:00,629
anybody else in the class then came to
the attention of the faculty

6070
02:06:00,629 --> 02:06:00,639
the attention of the faculty
 

6071
02:06:00,639 --> 02:06:02,950
the attention of the faculty
and it made me realize that i had some

6072
02:06:02,950 --> 02:06:02,960
and it made me realize that i had some
 

6073
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:03,669
and it made me realize that i had some
ability

6074

ability
 

6075
02:06:03,679 --> 02:06:08,790
