even mean by being determined why are we
 

327
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,150
even mean by being determined why are we
alive at the time we are and not at some

328
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,160
alive at the time we are and not at some
 

329
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,300
alive at the time we are and not at some
other time you know and and and you know

330
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:55,310
other time you know and and and you know
 

331
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,850
other time you know and and and you know
when you when you sort of contemplate

332
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:57,860
when you when you sort of contemplate
 

333
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,650
when you when you sort of contemplate
the enormity of those questions I think

334
00:06:59,650 --> 00:06:59,660
the enormity of those questions I think
 

335
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,110
the enormity of those questions I think
you know you could ask well then why why

336
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:02,120
you know you could ask well then why why
 

337
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,270
you know you could ask well then why why
be concerned with anything else all

338
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:04,280
be concerned with anything else all
 

339
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,120
be concerned with anything else all
right why why not spend your whole life

340
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,130
right why why not spend your whole life
 

341
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,190
right why why not spend your whole life
on those questions you know I think I

342
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:09,200
on those questions you know I think I
 

343
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,810
on those questions you know I think I
think in some sense that is the the

344
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:10,820
think in some sense that is the the
 

345
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,540
think in some sense that is the the
right way to phrase the question and you

346
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:13,550
right way to phrase the question and you
 

347
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,480
right way to phrase the question and you
know and and and actually you know what

348
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:16,490
know and and and actually you know what
 

349
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,250
know and and and actually you know what
what we learned you know I mean

350
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:18,260
what we learned you know I mean
 

351
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,170
what we learned you know I mean
throughout history but really starting

352
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:20,180
throughout history but really starting
 

353
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,730
throughout history but really starting
with the Scientific Revolution

354
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:21,740
with the Scientific Revolution
 

355
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,770
with the Scientific Revolution
we've got you know Galileo and so on is

356
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:23,780
we've got you know Galileo and so on is
 

357
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,110
we've got you know Galileo and so on is
that there is a good reason to you know

358
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:26,120
that there is a good reason to you know
 

359
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,410
that there is a good reason to you know
focus on narrower questions you know

360
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:29,420
focus on narrower questions you know
 

361
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,140
focus on narrower questions you know
more technical you know mathematical or

362
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:32,150
more technical you know mathematical or
 

363
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,300
more technical you know mathematical or
empirical questions and that is that you

364
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:34,310
empirical questions and that is that you
 

365
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,370
empirical questions and that is that you
can actually make progress on them right

366
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:36,380
can actually make progress on them right
 

367
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,130
can actually make progress on them right
and you can actually often answer them

368
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:39,140
and you can actually often answer them
 

369
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,140
and you can actually often answer them
and sometimes they actually tell you

370
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:41,150
and sometimes they actually tell you
 

371
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,850
and sometimes they actually tell you
something about the philosophical

372
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:42,860
something about the philosophical
 

373
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,130
something about the philosophical
questions that sort of you know may be

374
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:45,140
questions that sort of you know may be
 

375
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,260
questions that sort of you know may be
motivated your curiosity as a child

376
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:47,270
motivated your curiosity as a child
 

377
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,910
motivated your curiosity as a child
right you know they don't necessarily

378
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:48,920
right you know they don't necessarily
 

379
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,880
right you know they don't necessarily
resolve the philosophical questions but

380
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:51,890
resolve the philosophical questions but
 

381
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,530
resolve the philosophical questions but
sometimes they reframe your whole

382
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:53,540
sometimes they reframe your whole
 

383
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,050
sometimes they reframe your whole
understanding of them right and so for

384
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:56,060
understanding of them right and so for
 

385
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,300
understanding of them right and so for
me philosophy is just the thing that you

386
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:58,310
me philosophy is just the thing that you
 

387
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,890
me philosophy is just the thing that you
have in the background from the very

388
00:07:59,890 --> 00:07:59,900
have in the background from the very
 

389
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,460
have in the background from the very
beginning that you want to you know the

390
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:03,470
beginning that you want to you know the
 

391
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,930
beginning that you want to you know the
you know these are these are sort of the

392
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:04,940
you know these are these are sort of the
 

393
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,700
you know these are these are sort of the
reasons why you went into intellectual

394
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:06,710
reasons why you went into intellectual
 

395
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,290
reasons why you went into intellectual
life in the first place

396
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:08,300
life in the first place
 

397
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,800
life in the first place
at least the reasons why I did right but

398
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:11,810
at least the reasons why I did right but
 

399
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,320
at least the reasons why I did right but
you know math and science are tools that

400
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:14,330
you know math and science are tools that
 

401
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,690
you know math and science are tools that
we have for you know actually making

402
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:16,700
we have for you know actually making
 

403
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,900
we have for you know actually making
progress and you know hopefully even you

404
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:19,910
progress and you know hopefully even you
 

405
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,670
progress and you know hopefully even you
know changing our understanding of these

406
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:21,680
know changing our understanding of these
 

407
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,010
know changing our understanding of these
philosophical questions sometimes even

408
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:24,020
philosophical questions sometimes even
 

409
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,920
philosophical questions sometimes even
more than philosophy itself does what do

410
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:26,930
more than philosophy itself does what do
 

411
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,780
more than philosophy itself does what do
you think computer scientists avoid

412
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:28,790
you think computer scientists avoid
 

413
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,450
you think computer scientists avoid
these questions will run away from them

414
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:31,460
these questions will run away from them
 

415
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,220
these questions will run away from them
a little bit at least in technical

416
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:33,230
a little bit at least in technical
 

417
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,650
a little bit at least in technical
scientific discourse well I'm not I'm

418
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:35,660
scientific discourse well I'm not I'm
 

419

00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:37,670
not sure if they do so more than any
 

421
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:40,300
not sure if they do so more than any
other scientists though I mean I mean I

took a Vidkun Stein's course at
 

437
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,000
took a Vidkun Stein's course at
Cambridge you know argued with him I

438
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,010
Cambridge you know argued with him I
 

439
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,730
Cambridge you know argued with him I
just recently learned that a little bit

440
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:03,740
just recently learned that a little bit
 

441
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,060
just recently learned that a little bit
and it's actually fascinating I I was I

442
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:07,070
and it's actually fascinating I I was I
 

443
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,700
and it's actually fascinating I I was I
was trying to look for resources in

444
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:08,710
was trying to look for resources in
 

445
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,530
was trying to look for resources in
trying to understand where the sources

446
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:11,540
trying to understand where the sources
 

447
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,000
trying to understand where the sources
of disagreement and debates between

448
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,010
of disagreement and debates between
 

449
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,000
of disagreement and debates between
Wittgenstein and touring war that's an

450
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,010
Wittgenstein and touring war that's an
 

451
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,590
Wittgenstein and touring war that's an
interesting that these two minds have

452
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:17,600
interesting that these two minds have
 

453
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,990
interesting that these two minds have
somehow met in the arc of history

454
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,000
somehow met in the arc of history
 

455
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,960
somehow met in the arc of history
yeah well the transcript you know of

456
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:22,970
yeah well the transcript you know of
 

457
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,830
yeah well the transcript you know of
their the course which was in 1939 right

458
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:26,840
their the course which was in 1939 right
 

459
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,990
their the course which was in 1939 right
is one of the more fascinating documents

460
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:29,000
is one of the more fascinating documents
 

461
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,060
is one of the more fascinating documents
that I've ever read because you know a

462
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,070
that I've ever read because you know a
 

463
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,480
that I've ever read because you know a
vit concern is trying to say well all of

464
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:34,490
vit concern is trying to say well all of
 

465
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,410
vit concern is trying to say well all of
these these four

466
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:35,420
these these four
 

467
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:41,080
these these four
systems are just a complete irrelevance

468
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,090
systems are just a complete irrelevance
 

469
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,700
systems are just a complete irrelevance
is right if a formal system is

470
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:42,710
is right if a formal system is
 

471
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,890
is right if a formal system is
irrelevant who cares you know why does

472
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:44,900
irrelevant who cares you know why does
 

473
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,020
irrelevant who cares you know why does
that matter in real life right and

474
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,030
that matter in real life right and
 

475
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,090
that matter in real life right and
touring is saying well look you know if

476
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:49,100
touring is saying well look you know if
 

477
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,280
touring is saying well look you know if
you use an inconsistent formal system to

478
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,290
you use an inconsistent formal system to
 

479
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,230
you use an inconsistent formal system to
design a bridge you know the bridge may

480
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:53,240
design a bridge you know the bridge may
 

481
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,260
design a bridge you know the bridge may
collapse right and you know soso touring

482
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:56,270
collapse right and you know soso touring
 

483
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,120
collapse right and you know soso touring
in some sense is thinking decades ahead

484
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,130
in some sense is thinking decades ahead
 

485
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,330
in some sense is thinking decades ahead
you know I think of where Vidkun Stein

486
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:01,340
you know I think of where Vidkun Stein
 

487
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,890
you know I think of where Vidkun Stein
is the way with formal systems are

488
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:02,900
is the way with formal systems are
 

489
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,960
is the way with formal systems are
actually going to be used you know in

490
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:04,970
actually going to be used you know in
 

491
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,810
actually going to be used you know in
computers right to actually do things in

492
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:07,820
computers right to actually do things in
 

493
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,550
computers right to actually do things in
the world you know and it's interesting

494
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:09,560
the world you know and it's interesting
 

495
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,770
the world you know and it's interesting
that touring actually dropped the course

496
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:11,780
that touring actually dropped the course
 

497
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,290
that touring actually dropped the course
halfway through why because he had to go

498
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:14,300
halfway through why because he had to go
 

499
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,450
halfway through why because he had to go
to Bletchley Park and you know work on

500
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:16,460
to Bletchley Park and you know work on
 

501
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,040
to Bletchley Park and you know work on
something of more immediate importance

502
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,050
something of more immediate importance
 

503
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,510
something of more immediate importance
that's fascinating

504
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:19,520
that's fascinating
 

505
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,430
that's fascinating
if you take a step from philosophy to

506
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:21,440
if you take a step from philosophy to
 

507
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,890
if you take a step from philosophy to
actual like the biggest possible step to

508
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:23,900
actual like the biggest possible step to
 

509
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,870
actual like the biggest possible step to
actual engineering the actual real

510
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:25,880
actual engineering the actual real
 

511
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,910
actual engineering the actual real
impact yeah and I would say more

512
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:27,920
impact yeah and I would say more
 

513
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,850
impact yeah and I would say more
generally right uh you know a lot of

514
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:30,860
generally right uh you know a lot of
 

515
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:34,270
generally right uh you know a lot of
scientists are you know interested in

516
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:34,280
scientists are you know interested in
 

517
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,550
scientists are you know interested in
philosophy but they're also busy right

518
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:36,560
philosophy but they're also busy right
 

519
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,920
philosophy but they're also busy right
and they have you know a lot on their

520
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:38,930
and they have you know a lot on their
 

521
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,750
and they have you know a lot on their
plate and there are a lot of sort of

522
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:40,760
plate and there are a lot of sort of
 

523
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,060
plate and there are a lot of sort of
very concrete questions that are already

524
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:43,070
very concrete questions that are already
 

525
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,940
very concrete questions that are already
you know not answered but you know look

526
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:45,950
you know not answered but you know look
 

527
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,070
you know not answered but you know look
like they might be answerable right and

528
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:48,080
like they might be answerable right and
 

529
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,490
like they might be answerable right and
so then you could say well then why you

530
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:51,500
so then you could say well then why you
 

531
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,530
so then you could say well then why you
know break your brain over these you

532
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:53,540
know break your brain over these you
 

533
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,270
know break your brain over these you
know metaphysically unanswerable

534
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:55,280
know metaphysically unanswerable
 

535
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,740
know metaphysically unanswerable
questions when there were all these

536
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:56,750
questions when there were all these
 

537
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,760
questions when there were all these
answerable ones instead so I think you

538
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:00,770
answerable ones instead so I think you
 

539
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:05,380
answerable ones instead so I think you
know for me I I enjoy talking about

540
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:05,390
know for me I I enjoy talking about
 

541
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,600
know for me I I enjoy talking about
philosophy I even go to philosophy

542
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:07,610
philosophy I even go to philosophy
 

543
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:10,390
philosophy I even go to philosophy
conferences sometimes such as the you

544
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:10,400
conferences sometimes such as the you
 

545
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,820
conferences sometimes such as the you
know fqx I conferences I enjoy

546
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:12,830
know fqx I conferences I enjoy
 

547
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,190
know fqx I conferences I enjoy
interacting with philosophers I would

548
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:15,200
interacting with philosophers I would
 

549
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,390
interacting with philosophers I would
not want to be a professional

550
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:16,400
not want to be a professional
 

551
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,030
not want to be a professional
philosopher because I like being in a

552
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,040
philosopher because I like being in a
 

553
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,840
philosopher because I like being in a
field where I feel like you know uh you

554
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:22,850
field where I feel like you know uh you
 

555
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,840
field where I feel like you know uh you
know if I get too confused about the

556
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:25,850
know if I get too confused about the
 

557
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,430
know if I get too confused about the
sort of eternal questions then I can

558
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:27,440
sort of eternal questions then I can
 

559
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,220
sort of eternal questions then I can
actually make progress on something can

560
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:30,230
actually make progress on something can
 

561
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,660
actually make progress on something can
you maybe a link on that for just a

562
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:31,670
you maybe a link on that for just a
 

563
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,790
you maybe a link on that for just a
little longer yeah what do you think is

564
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:33,800
little longer yeah what do you think is
 

565
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,100
little longer yeah what do you think is
the difference so like the corollary of

566
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:36,110
the difference so like the corollary of
 

567
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,410
the difference so like the corollary of
the criticism that I mentioned

568
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:38,420
the criticism that I mentioned
 

569
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,470
the criticism that I mentioned
previously that why ask the

570
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:41,480
previously that why ask the
 

571
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,640
previously that why ask the
philosophical questions of the

572
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:42,650
philosophical questions of the
 

573
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,340
philosophical questions of the
mathematician is if you want to ask for

574
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:45,350
mathematician is if you want to ask for
 

575
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,900
mathematician is if you want to ask for
softball questions then invite a real

576
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:46,910
softball questions then invite a real
 

577
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,400
softball questions then invite a real
philosopher on and ask that

578
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:48,410
philosopher on and ask that
 

579
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:51,129
philosopher on and ask that
so what's the difference between the way

580
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:51,139
so what's the difference between the way
 

581
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:52,290
so what's the difference between the way
a computer scientist and mathematician

582
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:52,300
a computer scientist and mathematician
 

583
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,879
a computer scientist and mathematician
Ponder's a philosophical question and a

584
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:54,889
Ponder's a philosophical question and a
 

585
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:56,619
Ponder's a philosophical question and a
philosopher Ponder's the falafels

586
00:11:56,619 --> 00:11:56,629
philosopher Ponder's the falafels
 

587
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:58,569
philosopher Ponder's the falafels
question well I mean I mean a lot of it

588
00:11:58,569 --> 00:11:58,579
question well I mean I mean a lot of it
 

589
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:00,610
question well I mean I mean a lot of it
just depends on the individual all right

590
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:00,620
just depends on the individual all right
 

591
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,069
just depends on the individual all right
it's hard to make generalizations about

592
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:03,079
it's hard to make generalizations about
 

593
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:07,210
it's hard to make generalizations about
entire fields but you know I think I

594
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:07,220
entire fields but you know I think I
 

595
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,699
entire fields but you know I think I
think if we if we if we tried to we

596
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:09,709
think if we if we if we tried to we
 

597
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:11,740
think if we if we if we tried to we
tried to stereotype you know we would

598
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:11,750
tried to stereotype you know we would
 

599
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:17,079
tried to stereotype you know we would
say that uh you know as scientists very

600
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:17,089
say that uh you know as scientists very
 

601
00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:20,829
say that uh you know as scientists very
often will be less careful in their use

602
00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:20,839
often will be less careful in their use
 

603
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:22,929
often will be less careful in their use
of words you know I mean philosophers

604
00:12:22,929 --> 00:12:22,939
of words you know I mean philosophers
 

605
00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:25,360
of words you know I mean philosophers
are really experts in sort of you know

606
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:25,370
are really experts in sort of you know
 

607
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,980
are really experts in sort of you know
like when it when it when I talk to them

608
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:26,990
like when it when it when I talk to them
 

609
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,780
like when it when it when I talk to them
and they will just pounce if you know

610
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:28,790
and they will just pounce if you know
 

611
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,610
and they will just pounce if you know
use the wrong phrase for something

612
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:30,620
use the wrong phrase for something
 

613
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,980
use the wrong phrase for something
versus a very nice word you could say

614
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:32,990
versus a very nice word you could say
 

615
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,069
versus a very nice word you could say
cyclers yeah yeah where or you know they

616
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:36,079
cyclers yeah yeah where or you know they
 

617
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,079
cyclers yeah yeah where or you know they
will they will sort of interrogate my

618
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:38,089
will they will sort of interrogate my
 

619
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:40,360
will they will sort of interrogate my
word choices let's say to a much greater

620
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,370
word choices let's say to a much greater
 

621
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,059
word choices let's say to a much greater
extent than scientists would write and

622
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:43,069
extent than scientists would write and
 

623
00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:46,360
extent than scientists would write and
and scientists you know will often if

624
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:46,370
and scientists you know will often if
 

625
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,280
and scientists you know will often if
you ask them about a philosophical

626
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:48,290
you ask them about a philosophical
 

627
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,829
you ask them about a philosophical
problem like the hard problem in in of

628
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:50,839
problem like the hard problem in in of
 

629
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,990
problem like the hard problem in in of
consciousness or free will or whatever

630
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:53,000
consciousness or free will or whatever
 

631
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,540
consciousness or free will or whatever
they will try to relate it back to you

632
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:55,550
they will try to relate it back to you
 

633
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,429
they will try to relate it back to you
know recent research right you know

634
00:12:57,429 --> 00:12:57,439
know recent research right you know
 

635
00:12:57,439 --> 00:13:01,449
know recent research right you know
research about about neurobiology or you

636
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:01,459
research about about neurobiology or you
 

637
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:03,309
research about about neurobiology or you
know but you know the best of all was

638
00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:03,319
know but you know the best of all was
 

639
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:04,840
know but you know the best of all was
research that they personally are

640
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:04,850
research that they personally are
 

641
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,850

will want to talk about that you know
 

647
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,069
will want to talk about that you know
and it is what they will think of you

648

and it is what they will think of you
 

649
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,300
and it is what they will think of you
know and then of course you could have

know and then of course you could have
 

651
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,759
know and then of course you could have
an argument that maybe you know it's all

the question becomes one of how accurate
 

901
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,350
the question becomes one of how accurate
can such a model become can you make a

00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:14,360
can such a model become can you make a
 

903
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,900
can such a model become can you make a
model that will be accurate enough to

904
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:16,910
model that will be accurate enough to
 

905

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,539
really seriously threaten people's sense
of free will you know not just

908
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:21,549
of free will you know not just
 

909
00:18:21,549 --> 00:18:23,770
of free will you know not just
metaphysically but like really I've

910
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:23,780
metaphysically but like really I've
 

911
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,539
metaphysically but like really I've
written in this envelope what you were

912
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:25,549
written in this envelope what you were
 

913
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:28,060
written in this envelope what you were
going to say next is you see the right

914
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,070
going to say next is you see the right
 

915
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,470
going to say next is you see the right
term here so

916
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:29,480
term here so
 

917
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,230
term here so
it's also a level of abstraction has to

918
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,240
it's also a level of abstraction has to
 

919
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,970
it's also a level of abstraction has to
be right so if your yeah if you're

920
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:33,980
be right so if your yeah if you're
 

921
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,419
be right so if your yeah if you're
accurate at the somehow at the quantum

922
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:37,429
accurate at the somehow at the quantum
 

923
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:38,409
accurate at the somehow at the quantum
level hmm

924
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:38,419
level hmm
 

925
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:41,799

that may not be convincing to us at the

00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:41,809
that may not be convincing to us at the
 

927
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:44,710
that may not be convincing to us at the
human level well right but the question

928
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:44,720
human level well right but the question
 

929
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,500
human level well right but the question
is what accuracy at the sort of level of

930
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:47,510
is what accuracy at the sort of level of
 

931
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,899
is what accuracy at the sort of level of
the underlying mechanisms do you need in

932
00:18:49,899 --> 00:18:49,909
the underlying mechanisms do you need in
 

933
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:52,269
the underlying mechanisms do you need in
order to predict the behavior right at

very quickly dismiss that question is

very quickly dismiss that question is
 

949
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,450
very quickly dismiss that question is
irrelevant well to me it's totally

00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:27,639
know that it doesn't trouble me that
much because well you know I've never

966
00:19:27,639 --> 00:19:27,649
much because well you know I've never
 

967
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:30,700
much because well you know I've never
met such a demon hey you know uh you

968
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:30,710
met such a demon hey you know uh you
 

969
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,549
met such a demon hey you know uh you
know and we you know we even have some

00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:33,559
know and we you know we even have some
 

971
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:34,990
know and we you know we even have some
reasons the thing you know maybe it you

972
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:35,000
reasons the thing you know maybe it you
 

973
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,700
reasons the thing you know maybe it you
know it could not exist this part of our

I have this brain scanning machine you

982
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:44,990
I have this brain scanning machine you
 

983
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,049
I have this brain scanning machine you
know you step into it and then you know

984
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:47,059
know you step into it and then you know
 

985
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:49,240
know you step into it and then you know
every paper that you will ever write it

986
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:49,250
every paper that you will ever write it
 

987
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,159
every paper that you will ever write it
will write you know every thought that

00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:51,169
will write you know every thought that
 

989
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:52,840
will write you know every thought that
you will have you know even right now

00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:52,850
you will have you know even right now
 

991
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,180
you will have you know even right now
about the machine itself it will force a

you know a well if you can actually

994
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:57,260
you know a well if you can actually
 

995
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,230
you know a well if you can actually
demonstrate that then I think you know

996
00:19:59,230 --> 00:19:59,240
demonstrate that then I think you know
 

997
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,820
demonstrate that then I think you know
that that you know that that sort of

998
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:00,830
that that you know that that sort of
 

999
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,279
that that you know that that sort of
threatens my internal sense of having

00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:03,289
threatens my internal sense of having
 

1001
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:05,620
threatens my internal sense of having
free will in a much more visceral way

1002
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:05,630
free will in a much more visceral way
 

1003
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,960
free will in a much more visceral way
you know but now you notice that we're

1004
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:07,970
you know but now you notice that we're
 

1005
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,899
you know but now you notice that we're
asking in a much more empirical question

1006
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:10,909
asking in a much more empirical question
 

1007
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,570
asking in a much more empirical question
we're asking is such a machine possible

1008
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:13,580
we're asking is such a machine possible
 

1009
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,820
we're asking is such a machine possible
or isn't it I mean if it's not possible

1010
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:15,830
or isn't it I mean if it's not possible
 

1011
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,820
or isn't it I mean if it's not possible
then what in the woes of physics or what

1012
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:18,830
then what in the woes of physics or what
 

1013
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,370
then what in the woes of physics or what
about the behavior of the brain you know

1014
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:21,380
about the behavior of the brain you know
 

1015
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,860
about the behavior of the brain you know
prevents it from existing so if you

1016
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:23,870
prevents it from existing so if you
 

1017
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,419
prevents it from existing so if you
could philosophize a little bit within

1018
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:25,429
could philosophize a little bit within
 

1019
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:28,450
could philosophize a little bit within
this empirical question at where do you

1020
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:28,460
this empirical question at where do you
 

1021
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,659
this empirical question at where do you
think would enter the the by which

1022
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:31,669
think would enter the the by which
 

1023
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:33,789
think would enter the the by which
mechanism would enter the possibility

1024
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:33,799
mechanism would enter the possibility
 

1025
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,769
mechanism would enter the possibility
that we can't predict the outcome so

1026
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:35,779
that we can't predict the outcome so
 

1027
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:37,840
that we can't predict the outcome so
there would be something they'll be akin

1028
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:37,850
there would be something they'll be akin
 

1029
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,240
there would be something they'll be akin
to a free will yeah well you could say

1030
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:40,250
to a free will yeah well you could say
 

1031
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,340
to a free will yeah well you could say
the the sort of obvious possibility

1032
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:42,350
the the sort of obvious possibility
 

1033
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,270
the the sort of obvious possibility
which was you know

1034
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,280
which was you know
 

1035
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,270

about as soon as quantum mechanics was

1038
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,170
about as soon as quantum mechanics was
 

1039
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:53,410
about as soon as quantum mechanics was
discovered in the 1920s was that if you

00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:53,420
discovered in the 1920s was that if you
 

1041
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,320
discovered in the 1920s was that if you
know let's say a sodium ion channel you

1042
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:56,330
know let's say a sodium ion channel you
 

1043
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:59,620
know let's say a sodium ion channel you
know in the in the in in in the brain

00:20:59,620 --> 00:20:59,630
know in the in the in in in the brain
 

1045
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,720

hot skin equations in neuroscience right

1052
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:10,880
hot skin equations in neuroscience right
 

1053
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,520
hot skin equations in neuroscience right
which are differential equations that

00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:16,160
where does you know and this ultimately
 

1059
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,250
where does you know and this ultimately
governs let's say whether a neuron will

fire or not that's a basic chemical

1062
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:20,840
fire or not that's a basic chemical
 

1063
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,290
fire or not that's a basic chemical
process or electrical process by which

signals are sent in the brain exactly
 

1067
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,270
signals are sent in the brain exactly
exactly and and you know and so you

1068
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:28,280
exactly and and you know and so you
 

1069
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,710
exactly and and you know and so you
could ask well well where does the

1070
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:29,720
could ask well well where does the
 

1071
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,780
could ask well well where does the
randomness in the process you know that

1072
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:31,790
randomness in the process you know that
 

1073
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:35,200
randomness in the process you know that
that neuroscientists you're but what

1074
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,210
that neuroscientists you're but what
 

1075
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,390
that neuroscientists you're but what
neuroscientists would would treat is

1076
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:37,400
neuroscientists would would treat is
 

1077
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,130
neuroscientists would would treat is
randomness where does it come from

1078
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:39,140
randomness where does it come from
 

1079
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,140
randomness where does it come from
you know ultimately it's thermal noise

1080
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:41,150
you know ultimately it's thermal noise
 

1081
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,210
you know ultimately it's thermal noise
right where does thermal noise come from

1082
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:43,220
right where does thermal noise come from
 

1083
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,340
right where does thermal noise come from
but ultimately you know there were some

1084
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:45,350
but ultimately you know there were some
 

1085
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,050
but ultimately you know there were some
quantum mechanical events at the

1086
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:47,060
quantum mechanical events at the
 

1087
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,960
quantum mechanical events at the
molecular level that are getting sort of

1088
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:48,970
molecular level that are getting sort of
 

1089
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:51,400
molecular level that are getting sort of
chaotically amplified but you know a

1090
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:51,410
chaotically amplified but you know a
 

1091
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:55,270
chaotically amplified but you know a
sort of butterfly effect and so you know

1092
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:55,280
sort of butterfly effect and so you know
 

1093
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,690
sort of butterfly effect and so you know
even if you knew the complete quantum

1094
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:58,700
even if you knew the complete quantum
 

1095
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,670
even if you knew the complete quantum
state of someone's brain you know at

1096
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:00,680
state of someone's brain you know at
 

1097
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,620
state of someone's brain you know at
best you could predict the probabilities

1098
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:02,630
best you could predict the probabilities
 

1099
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,210
best you could predict the probabilities
that they would do one thing or do

1100
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:04,220
that they would do one thing or do
 

1101
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,370
that they would do one thing or do
another thing right I think that part is

1102
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:06,380
another thing right I think that part is
 

1103
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,780
another thing right I think that part is
actually relatively uncontroversial

1104
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:07,790
actually relatively uncontroversial
 

1105
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:11,140
actually relatively uncontroversial
right the the controversial question is

1106
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,150
right the the controversial question is
 

1107
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,960
right the the controversial question is
whether any of it matters for the sort

1108
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:13,970
whether any of it matters for the sort
 

1109
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,730
whether any of it matters for the sort
of philosophical questions that we care

1110
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:15,740
of philosophical questions that we care
 

1111
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,830
of philosophical questions that we care
about because you could say if all it's

1112
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:17,840
about because you could say if all it's
 

1113
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,020
about because you could say if all it's
doing is just injecting some randomness

1114
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,030
doing is just injecting some randomness
 

1115
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:22,600
doing is just injecting some randomness
into an otherwise completely mechanistic

1116
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:22,610
into an otherwise completely mechanistic
 

1117
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:25,270
into an otherwise completely mechanistic
process well then who cares right and

1118
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:25,280
process well then who cares right and
 

1119
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,640
process well then who cares right and
more concretely if you could build a

1120
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:27,650
more concretely if you could build a
 

1121
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,710
more concretely if you could build a
machine that you know could just

1122
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:29,720
machine that you know could just
 

1123
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,370
machine that you know could just
calculate the even just up the

1124
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:32,380
calculate the even just up the
 

1125
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,450
calculate the even just up the
probabilities of all of the possible

1126
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:34,460
probabilities of all of the possible
 

1127
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,100
probabilities of all of the possible
things that you would do all right and

1128
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:36,110
things that you would do all right and
 

1129
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:39,400
things that you would do all right and
you know um you know if all the things

1130
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:39,410
you know um you know if all the things
 

1131
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,560
you know um you know if all the things
that said you had a 10% chance of doing

1132
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:41,570
that said you had a 10% chance of doing
 

1133
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,900
that said you had a 10% chance of doing
you did exactly a tenth of them you know

1134
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:43,910
you did exactly a tenth of them you know
 

1135
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,760
you did exactly a tenth of them you know
and and and and and and so on that

1136
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:45,770
and and and and and and so on that
 

1137
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,860
and and and and and and so on that
somehow also takes away the feeling of

1138
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:47,870
somehow also takes away the feeling of
 

1139
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:48,190
somehow also takes away the feeling of
freedom

1140
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:48,200
freedom
 

1141
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,200
freedom
exactly I mean I mean to me it seems

1142
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,210
exactly I mean I mean to me it seems
 

1143
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,780
exactly I mean I mean to me it seems
essentially just as bad as if the

1144
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:52,790
essentially just as bad as if the
 

1145
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,760
essentially just as bad as if the
Machine deterministically predicted you

1146
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:54,770
Machine deterministically predicted you
 

1147
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,800
Machine deterministically predicted you
it seems you know hardly different from

1148
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:56,810
it seems you know hardly different from
 

1149
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:57,070
it seems you know hardly different from
that

1150
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:57,080
that
 

1151
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,330
that
so that so then but a more a more subtle

1152
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:01,340
so that so then but a more a more subtle
 

1153
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,970
so that so then but a more a more subtle
question is could you even learn enough

1154
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:03,980
question is could you even learn enough
 

1155
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,310
question is could you even learn enough
about someone's brain to do that okay

1156
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:06,320
about someone's brain to do that okay
 

1157
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,280
about someone's brain to do that okay
because you know another central fact

1158
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:09,290
because you know another central fact
 

1159
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:13,480
because you know another central fact
about quantum mechanics is that making a

1160
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:13,490
about quantum mechanics is that making a
 

1161
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,340
about quantum mechanics is that making a
measurement on a quantum state is an

1162
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:15,350
measurement on a quantum state is an
 

1163
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:18,540
measurement on a quantum state is an
inherently destructive operation okay so

1164
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:18,550
inherently destructive operation okay so
 

1165
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:21,490
inherently destructive operation okay so
you know if I want to measure the you

1166
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:21,500
you know if I want to measure the you
 

1167
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,800
you know if I want to measure the you
know position of a particle right it was

1168
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:23,810
know position of a particle right it was
 

1169
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,540
know position of a particle right it was
well before I measure it it had a

1170
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:25,550
well before I measure it it had a
 

1171
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:27,490
well before I measure it it had a
superposition over many different

1172
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:27,500
superposition over many different
 

1173
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,290
superposition over many different
positions as soon as I measure I

1174
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:29,300
positions as soon as I measure I
 

1175
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,840
positions as soon as I measure I
localized it right so now I know the

1176
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:31,850
localized it right so now I know the
 

1177
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,670
localized it right so now I know the
position but I've also fundamentally

1178
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:33,680
position but I've also fundamentally
 

1179
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,450
position but I've also fundamentally
changed the state and so so you could

1180
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:37,460
changed the state and so so you could
 

1181
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,030
changed the state and so so you could
say well maybe in trying to build a

1182
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:40,040
say well maybe in trying to build a
 

1183
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,770
say well maybe in trying to build a
model of someone's brain that was

1184
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:41,780
model of someone's brain that was
 

1185
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,600
model of someone's brain that was
accurate enough to actually you know

1186
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:43,610
accurate enough to actually you know
 

1187
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:46,380
accurate enough to actually you know
make let's say even even well calibrated

1188
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:46,390
make let's say even even well calibrated
 

1189
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,580
make let's say even even well calibrated
probabilistic predictions of their

1190
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:48,590
probabilistic predictions of their
 

1191
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,830
probabilistic predictions of their
future behavior maybe you would have to

1192
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:50,840
future behavior maybe you would have to
 

1193
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,480
future behavior maybe you would have to
make measurements that we're just so

1194
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:52,490
make measurements that we're just so
 

1195
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,650
make measurements that we're just so
accurate that you were just

1196
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:53,660
accurate that you were just
 

1197
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,170
accurate that you were just
fundamentally alter their brain okay or

1198
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:56,180
fundamentally alter their brain okay or
 

1199
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,260
fundamentally alter their brain okay or
or or or maybe not maybe you only you

1200
00:23:59,260 --> 00:23:59,270
or or or maybe not maybe you only you
 

1201
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,120
or or or maybe not maybe you only you
know you it would suffice to just make

1202
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,130
know you it would suffice to just make
 

1203
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:03,760
know you it would suffice to just make
some nano robots that just measured some

1204
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:03,770
some nano robots that just measured some
 

1205
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,890
some nano robots that just measured some
sort of much larger scale you know

1206
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:05,900
sort of much larger scale you know
 

1207
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,920
sort of much larger scale you know
macroscopic behavior like you know is

1208
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:08,930
macroscopic behavior like you know is
 

1209
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,660
macroscopic behavior like you know is
that you know what is this neuron doing

1210
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:10,670
that you know what is this neuron doing
 

1211
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,730
that you know what is this neuron doing
what is that neuron doing maybe that

1212
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:12,740
what is that neuron doing maybe that
 

1213
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,010
what is that neuron doing maybe that
would be enough see but now you know III

1214
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:15,020
would be enough see but now you know III
 

1215
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,290
would be enough see but now you know III
but what I claim is that we're now

1216
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:17,300
but what I claim is that we're now
 

1217
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,630
but what I claim is that we're now
asking a question you know in which you

1218
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:19,640
asking a question you know in which you
 

1219
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,970
asking a question you know in which you
know it is it is it is possible to

1220
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:21,980
know it is it is it is possible to
 

1221
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,920
know it is it is it is possible to
envision what progress on it would look

1222
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:23,930
envision what progress on it would look
 

1223
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,080
envision what progress on it would look
like yeah but just as you said that

1224
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,090
like yeah but just as you said that
 

1225
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,960
like yeah but just as you said that
question may be slightly detached from

1226
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:28,970
question may be slightly detached from
 

1227
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,120
question may be slightly detached from
the philosophical question in the sense

1228
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,130
the philosophical question in the sense
 

1229
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,970
the philosophical question in the sense
if consciousness somehow has a role to

1230
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:33,980
if consciousness somehow has a role to
 

1231
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,130
if consciousness somehow has a role to
the experience of free will because

1232
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:36,140
the experience of free will because
 

1233
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,990
the experience of free will because
ultimately what we're talking about free

1234
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:38,000
ultimately what we're talking about free
 

1235
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,110
ultimately what we're talking about free
will we're also talking about not just

1236
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:41,120
will we're also talking about not just
 

1237
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,240
will we're also talking about not just
the predictability of our actions but

1238
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:43,250
the predictability of our actions but
 

1239
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,130
the predictability of our actions but
somehow the experience of them

1240
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:45,140
somehow the experience of them
 

1241
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,800
somehow the experience of them
predictability yeah well I mean a lot of

1242
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:47,810
predictability yeah well I mean a lot of
 

1243
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,530
predictability yeah well I mean a lot of
philosophical questions ultimately like

1244
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:50,540
philosophical questions ultimately like
 

1245
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,330
philosophical questions ultimately like
feed back to the hard problem of

00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:52,340
feed back to the hard problem of
 

1247
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,550
feed back to the hard problem of
consciousness you know and as much as

1248
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:54,560
consciousness you know and as much as
 

1249
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,740
consciousness you know and as much as
you can try to sort of talk around it or

1250
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:56,750
you can try to sort of talk around it or
 

1251
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,660
you can try to sort of talk around it or
not right and you know and then and and

1252
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:58,670
not right and you know and then and and
 

1253
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:01,120
not right and you know and then and and
there is a reason why people try to talk

1254
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:01,130
there is a reason why people try to talk
 

1255
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,330
there is a reason why people try to talk
around it which is that you know

1256
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:03,340
around it which is that you know
 

1257
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,460
around it which is that you know
Democritus talked about the hard problem

1258
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:06,470
Democritus talked about the hard problem
 

1259
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:10,060
Democritus talked about the hard problem
of consciousness you know in 400 BC in

of consciousness you know in 400 BC in

that would be totally recognizable to us

that would be totally recognizable to us
 

1265
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,130
that would be totally recognizable to us
today right and it's really not clear if

today right and it's really not clear if
 

1267

there a Q prime type of sub question

there a Q prime type of sub question

it's something about cars oh well I mean

1276
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,090
it's something about cars oh well I mean
 

1277
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:27,340
it's something about cars oh well I mean
well I mean there is the whole question

1278
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:27,350
well I mean there is the whole question
 

1279
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:30,190
well I mean there is the whole question
of you know of AI right of you know can

1280
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:30,200
of you know of AI right of you know can
 

1281
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,510
of you know of AI right of you know can
you build a human level or superhuman

1282
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:34,520
you build a human level or superhuman
 

1283
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,990
you build a human level or superhuman
level AI and you know can it can it work

1284
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,000
level AI and you know can it can it work
 

1285
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,820
level AI and you know can it can it work
in a completely different substrate from

1286
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:39,830
in a completely different substrate from
 

1287
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,320
in a completely different substrate from
the brain I mean there's you know of

1288
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:41,330
the brain I mean there's you know of
 

1289
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,180
the brain I mean there's you know of
course that was Alan Turing's point and

1290
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:43,190
course that was Alan Turing's point and
 

1291
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,160
course that was Alan Turing's point and
you know and and and even if that was

1292
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,170
you know and and and even if that was
 

1293
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,020
you know and and and even if that was
done it's you know maybe people would

1294
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:47,030
done it's you know maybe people would
 

1295
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,700
done it's you know maybe people would
still argue about the hard problem of

1296
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:48,710
still argue about the hard problem of
 

1297
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:51,280
still argue about the hard problem of
consciousness right and yet you know my

1298
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:51,290
consciousness right and yet you know my
 

1299
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,680
consciousness right and yet you know my
claim is a little different my claim is

1300
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:53,690
claim is a little different my claim is
 

1301
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:56,050
claim is a little different my claim is
that in a world where you know there

1302
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:56,060
that in a world where you know there
 

1303
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:59,350
that in a world where you know there
were you know human-level AI is where we

1304
00:25:59,350 --> 00:25:59,360
were you know human-level AI is where we
 

1305
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,450
were you know human-level AI is where we
had been even overtaken by such a eyes

1306
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:01,460
had been even overtaken by such a eyes
 

1307
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,570
had been even overtaken by such a eyes
the entire discussion of the hard

1308
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:04,580
the entire discussion of the hard
 

1309
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,280
the entire discussion of the hard
problem of consciousness would have a

1310
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:06,290
problem of consciousness would have a
 

1311
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,050
problem of consciousness would have a
different character right it would take

1312
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:08,060
different character right it would take
 

1313
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,970
different character right it would take
place in different terms in such a world

1314
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:09,980
place in different terms in such a world
 

1315
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,190
place in different terms in such a world
even if we hadn't answered the question

1316
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:12,200
even if we hadn't answered the question
 

1317
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,680
even if we hadn't answered the question
and and my claim about free will would

1318
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:14,690
and and my claim about free will would
 

1319
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,720
and and my claim about free will would
be similar right that if there if this

1320
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:16,730
be similar right that if there if this
 

1321
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,820
be similar right that if there if this
prediction machine that I was talking

1322
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:18,830
prediction machine that I was talking
 

1323
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,110
prediction machine that I was talking
about could actually be built

1324
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:20,120
about could actually be built
 

1325
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,300
about could actually be built
well now the entire discussion of the

1326
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:22,310
well now the entire discussion of the
 

1327
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,860
well now the entire discussion of the
you know a free will is sort of

1328
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:23,870
you know a free will is sort of
 

1329
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:26,740
you know a free will is sort of
transformed by that you know even if in

1330
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:26,750
transformed by that you know even if in
 

1331
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,110
transformed by that you know even if in
some sense the the metaphysical question

1332
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,120
some sense the the metaphysical question
 

1333
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,650
some sense the the metaphysical question
hasn't been answered yeah exactly

1334
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:32,660
hasn't been answered yeah exactly
 

1335
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,630
hasn't been answered yeah exactly
transforms it fundamentally because say

1336
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:34,640
transforms it fundamentally because say
 

1337
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,400
transforms it fundamentally because say
that machine does tell you that it can

1338
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:36,410
that machine does tell you that it can
 

1339
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,560
that machine does tell you that it can
predict perfectly and yet there is this

1340
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:38,570
predict perfectly and yet there is this
 

1341
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,300
predict perfectly and yet there is this
deep experience of free will and then

1342
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:40,310
deep experience of free will and then
 

1343
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,070
deep experience of free will and then
that changes the question completely

1344
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,080
that changes the question completely
 

1345
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,700
that changes the question completely
yeah and it starts actually getting to

1346
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:45,710
yeah and it starts actually getting to
 

1347
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:50,140
yeah and it starts actually getting to
the question of the a the a GI the

1348
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:50,150
the question of the a the a GI the
 

1349
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,950
the question of the a the a GI the
touring questions if the demonstration

1350
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:53,960
touring questions if the demonstration
 

1351
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,930
touring questions if the demonstration
of free will the demonstration of

1352
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:55,940
of free will the demonstration of
 

1353
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,310
of free will the demonstration of
intelligence the demonstration of

1354
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:57,320
intelligence the demonstration of
 

1355
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,430
intelligence the demonstration of
consciousness does that equal

1356
00:26:59,430 --> 00:26:59,440
consciousness does that equal
 

1357
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,810
consciousness does that equal
nauseousness intelligence and free will

1358
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:01,820
nauseousness intelligence and free will
 

1359
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,010
nauseousness intelligence and free will
but see elects if every time I was

1360
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:06,020
but see elects if every time I was
 

1361
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,020
but see elects if every time I was
contemplating a decision you know this

1362
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,030
contemplating a decision you know this
 

1363
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,330
contemplating a decision you know this
machine had printed out an envelope you

1364
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:10,340
machine had printed out an envelope you
 

1365
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,830
machine had printed out an envelope you
know where I could open it and see that

1366
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:11,840
know where I could open it and see that
 

1367
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,600
know where I could open it and see that
it knew my decision I think that

1368
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:13,610
it knew my decision I think that
 

1369
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,370
it knew my decision I think that
actually would change my subjective

1370
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:15,380
actually would change my subjective
 

1371
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,070
actually would change my subjective
experience of making decisions you might

1372
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:18,080
experience of making decisions you might
 

1373
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,720
experience of making decisions you might
mean doesn't knowledge change your

1374
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:19,730
mean doesn't knowledge change your
 

1375
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,580
mean doesn't knowledge change your
subjective experience well well you know

1376
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:21,590
subjective experience well well you know
 

1377
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,930
subjective experience well well you know
I mean I mean the knowledge that this

1378
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:22,940
I mean I mean the knowledge that this
 

1379
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,960
I mean I mean the knowledge that this
machine had pretty

1380
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:23,970
machine had pretty
 

1381
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,340
machine had pretty
did everything I would do I mean it

1382
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:25,350
did everything I would do I mean it
 

1383
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,650
did everything I would do I mean it
might drive me completely insane right

1384
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:27,660
might drive me completely insane right
 

1385
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,240
might drive me completely insane right
but at any rate it would change my

1386
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:29,250
but at any rate it would change my
 

1387
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:32,180
but at any rate it would change my
experience to act you know to not just

1388
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:32,190
experience to act you know to not just
 

1389
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,190
experience to act you know to not just
discuss such a machine as a thought

1390
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:34,200
discuss such a machine as a thought
 

1391
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,990
discuss such a machine as a thought
experiment but to actually see it yeah I

1392
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:39,000
experiment but to actually see it yeah I
 

1393
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,760
experiment but to actually see it yeah I
mean I mean you know you could say at

1394
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:40,770
mean I mean you know you could say at
 

1395
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:43,220
mean I mean you know you could say at
that point you know you could say you

1396
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:43,230
that point you know you could say you
 

1397
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,260
that point you know you could say you
know what why not simply call this

1398
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:45,270
know what why not simply call this
 

1399
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,780
know what why not simply call this
machine a second instantiation of me and

1400
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:47,790
machine a second instantiation of me and
 

1401
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,060
machine a second instantiation of me and
be done with it right what we know what

1402
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,070
be done with it right what we know what
 

1403
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:53,720
be done with it right what we know what
why even privilege the original me over

1404
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:53,730
why even privilege the original me over
 

1405
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,210
why even privilege the original me over
this perfect duplicate that that exists

1406
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:56,220
this perfect duplicate that that exists
 

1407
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,100
this perfect duplicate that that exists
in the machine yeah or yeah there could

1408
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:58,110
in the machine yeah or yeah there could
 

1409
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,930
in the machine yeah or yeah there could
be a religious experience with a Jew

1410
00:27:59,930 --> 00:27:59,940
be a religious experience with a Jew
 

1411
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,670
be a religious experience with a Jew
it's kind of what God throughout the

1412
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:01,680
it's kind of what God throughout the
 

1413
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,760
it's kind of what God throughout the
generations is supposed to that God kind

1414
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:04,770
generations is supposed to that God kind
 

1415
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,920
generations is supposed to that God kind
of represents that perfect machine is

1416
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:06,930
of represents that perfect machine is
 

1417
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:11,300
of represents that perfect machine is
able to I guess actually well I I don't

1418
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:11,310
able to I guess actually well I I don't
 

1419
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,800
able to I guess actually well I I don't
even know what a work what are the

1420
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:12,810
even know what a work what are the
 

1421
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:15,740
even know what a work what are the
religious interpretations of freewill

1422
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:15,750
religious interpretations of freewill
 

1423
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,900
religious interpretations of freewill
yeah does so if God knows perfectly

1424
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:19,910
yeah does so if God knows perfectly
 

1425
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:23,270
yeah does so if God knows perfectly
everything in in religion in the various

1426
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:23,280
everything in in religion in the various
 

1427
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,300
everything in in religion in the various
religions were does freewill fit into

1428
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:26,310
religions were does freewill fit into
 

1429
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,160
religions were does freewill fit into
that do you know that has been one of

1430
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,170
that do you know that has been one of
 

1431
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:30,230
that do you know that has been one of
the big things that theologians have

1432
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:30,240
the big things that theologians have
 

1433
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,380
the big things that theologians have
argued about for thousands of years you

1434
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:33,390
argued about for thousands of years you
 

1435
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,630
argued about for thousands of years you
know I am I am NOT a theologian maybe I

1436
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:35,640
know I am I am NOT a theologian maybe I
 

1437
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,220
know I am I am NOT a theologian maybe I
shouldn't go there there's not a clear

1438
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:37,230
shouldn't go there there's not a clear
 

1439
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,530
shouldn't go there there's not a clear
answer in a book like I mean I mean this

1440
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:39,540
answer in a book like I mean I mean this
 

1441
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,660
answer in a book like I mean I mean this
is you know the Calvinists debated this

1442
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:41,670
is you know the Calvinists debated this
 

1443
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,790
is you know the Calvinists debated this
the you know this has been you know I

1444
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:43,800
the you know this has been you know I
 

1445
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,220
the you know this has been you know I
mean different religious movements have

1446
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:46,230
mean different religious movements have
 

1447
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,510
mean different religious movements have
taken different positions on that

1448
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:47,520
taken different positions on that
 

1449
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,460
taken different positions on that
question but that is how they think

1450
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:49,470
question but that is how they think
 

1451
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,560
question but that is how they think
about it you know meanwhile you know a

1452
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:51,570
about it you know meanwhile you know a
 

1453
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:54,440
about it you know meanwhile you know a
large part of sort of what what animates

1454
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:54,450
large part of sort of what what animates
 

1455
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,420
large part of sort of what what animates
you know theoretical computer science

1456
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:56,430
you know theoretical computer science
 

1457
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,860
you know theoretical computer science
you could say is you know we're asking

1458
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:57,870
you could say is you know we're asking
 

1459
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,530
you could say is you know we're asking
sort of what are the ultimate limits of

1460
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:00,540
sort of what are the ultimate limits of
 

1461
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,290
sort of what are the ultimate limits of
you know what you can know or you know

1462
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:03,300
you know what you can know or you know
 

1463
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,990
you know what you can know or you know
calculate or figure out by you know

1464
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:06,000
calculate or figure out by you know
 

1465
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,210
calculate or figure out by you know
entities that you can actually build in

1466
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:08,220
entities that you can actually build in
 

1467
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,820
entities that you can actually build in
the physical world right and if I were

1468
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:10,830
the physical world right and if I were
 

1469
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,500
the physical world right and if I were
trying to explain it to a theologian

1470
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:12,510
trying to explain it to a theologian
 

1471
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,000
trying to explain it to a theologian
maybe I would say you know we are

1472
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,010
maybe I would say you know we are
 

1473
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:16,250
maybe I would say you know we are
studying you know to what extent you

1474
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:16,260
studying you know to what extent you
 

1475
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,290
studying you know to what extent you
know gods can be made manifest in the

1476
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:18,300
know gods can be made manifest in the
 

1477
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,300
know gods can be made manifest in the
physical world I'm not sure my

1478
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:20,310
physical world I'm not sure my
 

1479
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:24,470
physical world I'm not sure my
colleagues would like that so let's talk

1480
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:24,480
colleagues would like that so let's talk
 

1481
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,390
colleagues would like that so let's talk
about quantum computers yeah sure sure

1482
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:26,400
about quantum computers yeah sure sure
 

1483
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,660
about quantum computers yeah sure sure
as you said modern computing at least in

1484
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:29,670
as you said modern computing at least in
 

1485
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:32,480
as you said modern computing at least in
the 1990s was a profound story at the

1486
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:32,490
the 1990s was a profound story at the
 

1487
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:34,070
the 1990s was a profound story at the
intersection of computer science physics

1488
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:34,080
intersection of computer science physics
 

1489
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,050
intersection of computer science physics
engineering math and philosophy

1490
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:36,060
engineering math and philosophy
 

1491
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,730
engineering math and philosophy
so the

1492
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:36,740
so the
 

1493
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,549
so the
there's this broad and deep aspect to

1494
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:39,559
there's this broad and deep aspect to
 

1495
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:41,049
there's this broad and deep aspect to
quantum computing that represents more

1496
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:41,059
quantum computing that represents more
 

1497
00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:43,000
quantum computing that represents more
than just the quantum computer yes but

1498
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,010
than just the quantum computer yes but
 

1499
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:45,960
than just the quantum computer yes but
can we start at the very basics what is

1500
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:45,970
can we start at the very basics what is
 

1501
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:49,060
can we start at the very basics what is
quantum computing yeah so it's a

1502
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:49,070
quantum computing yeah so it's a
 

1503
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:52,899
quantum computing yeah so it's a
proposal for a new type of computation I

1504
00:29:52,899 --> 00:29:52,909
proposal for a new type of computation I
 

1505
00:29:52,909 --> 00:29:55,360
proposal for a new type of computation I
would say a new way to harness nature to

1506
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:55,370
would say a new way to harness nature to
 

1507
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:58,060
would say a new way to harness nature to
do computation that is based on the

1508
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:58,070
do computation that is based on the
 

1509
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,680
do computation that is based on the
principles of quantum mechanics

1510
00:29:59,680 --> 00:29:59,690
principles of quantum mechanics
 

1511
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,720
principles of quantum mechanics
okay now the principles of quantum

1512
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:01,730
okay now the principles of quantum
 

1513
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:05,380
okay now the principles of quantum
mechanics have been in place since 1926

1514
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:05,390
mechanics have been in place since 1926
 

1515
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:08,230
mechanics have been in place since 1926
you know they haven't changed you know

1516
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:08,240
you know they haven't changed you know
 

1517
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,090
you know they haven't changed you know
what's new is you know how we want to

1518
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:10,100
what's new is you know how we want to
 

1519
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,240
what's new is you know how we want to
use them okay so what does quantum

1520
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:13,250
use them okay so what does quantum
 

1521
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,760
use them okay so what does quantum
mechanics say about the world you know

1522
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:15,770
mechanics say about the world you know
 

1523
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,680
mechanics say about the world you know
the the physicists I think over the

1524
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:17,690
the the physicists I think over the
 

1525
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,480
the the physicists I think over the
generations you know convinced people

1526
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:19,490
generations you know convinced people
 

1527
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,580
generations you know convinced people
that that is an unbelievably complicated

1528
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:21,590
that that is an unbelievably complicated
 

1529
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,980
that that is an unbelievably complicated
question and you know just give up on

1530
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:23,990
question and you know just give up on
 

1531
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,529
question and you know just give up on
trying to understand it I can let you in

1532
00:30:26,529 --> 00:30:26,539
trying to understand it I can let you in
 

1533
00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:28,960
trying to understand it I can let you in
not not being a physicist I can let you

1534
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:28,970
not not being a physicist I can let you
 

1535
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,149
not not being a physicist I can let you
in on a secret which is that it becomes

1536
00:30:31,149 --> 00:30:31,159
in on a secret which is that it becomes
 

1537
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:33,519
in on a secret which is that it becomes
a lot simpler if you do what we do in

1538
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:33,529
a lot simpler if you do what we do in
 

1539
00:30:33,529 --> 00:30:36,070
a lot simpler if you do what we do in
quantum information theory and sort of

1540
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:36,080
quantum information theory and sort of
 

1541
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,310
quantum information theory and sort of
take the physics out of it so the way

1542
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:39,320
take the physics out of it so the way
 

1543
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,200
take the physics out of it so the way
that we think about quantum mechanics is

1544
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:41,210
that we think about quantum mechanics is
 

1545
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,659
that we think about quantum mechanics is
sort of as a generalization of the rules

1546
00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:43,669
sort of as a generalization of the rules
 

1547
00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:47,200
sort of as a generalization of the rules
of probability themselves so you know

1548
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:47,210
of probability themselves so you know
 

1549
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,060
of probability themselves so you know
you might say there's a you know there

1550
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:49,070
you might say there's a you know there
 

1551
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:51,399
you might say there's a you know there
was a 30% chance that it was going to

1552
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:51,409
was a 30% chance that it was going to
 

1553
00:30:51,409 --> 00:30:53,409
was a 30% chance that it was going to
snow today or something you would never

1554
00:30:53,409 --> 00:30:53,419
snow today or something you would never
 

1555
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:55,570
snow today or something you would never
say that there was a negative 30% chance

1556
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:55,580
say that there was a negative 30% chance
 

1557
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,299
say that there was a negative 30% chance
right that would be nonsense much less

1558
00:30:58,299 --> 00:30:58,309
right that would be nonsense much less
 

1559
00:30:58,309 --> 00:30:59,590
right that would be nonsense much less
would you say that there was a you know

1560
00:30:59,590 --> 00:30:59,600
would you say that there was a you know
 

1561
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,779
would you say that there was a you know
an I percent chance you know square root

1562
00:31:01,779 --> 00:31:01,789
an I percent chance you know square root
 

1563
00:31:01,789 --> 00:31:05,159
an I percent chance you know square root
of minus 1% chance now the central

1564
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:05,169
of minus 1% chance now the central
 

1565
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:08,610
of minus 1% chance now the central
discovery that sort of quantum mechanics

1566
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:08,620
discovery that sort of quantum mechanics
 

1567
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:13,659
discovery that sort of quantum mechanics
made is that fundamentally the world is

1568
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:13,669
made is that fundamentally the world is
 

1569
00:31:13,669 --> 00:31:17,919
made is that fundamentally the world is
described by you know these are let's

1570
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:17,929
described by you know these are let's
 

1571
00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:20,620
described by you know these are let's
say the possibilities for you know what

1572
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:20,630
say the possibilities for you know what
 

1573
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:23,380
say the possibilities for you know what
a system could be doing are described

1574
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:23,390
a system could be doing are described
 

1575
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:25,810
a system could be doing are described
using numbers called amplitudes okay

1576
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:25,820
using numbers called amplitudes okay
 

1577
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,840
using numbers called amplitudes okay
which are like probabilities in some

1578
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:28,850
which are like probabilities in some
 

1579
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:31,299
which are like probabilities in some
ways but they are not probabilities they

1580
00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:31,309
ways but they are not probabilities they
 

1581
00:31:31,309 --> 00:31:33,039
ways but they are not probabilities they
can be positive for one thing they can

1582
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:33,049
can be positive for one thing they can
 

1583
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:35,560
can be positive for one thing they can
be positive or negative in fact they can

1584
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:35,570
be positive or negative in fact they can
 

1585
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:37,899
be positive or negative in fact they can
even be complex numbers okay and if

1586
00:31:37,899 --> 00:31:37,909
even be complex numbers okay and if
 

1587
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:39,510
even be complex numbers okay and if
you've heard of a quantum superposition

1588
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:39,520
you've heard of a quantum superposition
 

1589
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,299
you've heard of a quantum superposition
this just means the sum state of affairs

1590
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:43,309
this just means the sum state of affairs
 

1591
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:46,029
this just means the sum state of affairs
where you assign an amplitude one of

1592
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:46,039
where you assign an amplitude one of

them in on measuring it so for example

1598
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:54,390
them in on measuring it so for example
 

1599
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:57,860
them in on measuring it so for example
you might say that an electron has some

1600
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:57,870
you might say that an electron has some
 

1601
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,050
you might say that an electron has some

you look to see where it is

1606
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:04,890
you look to see where it is
 

1607
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:07,430
you look to see where it is
you will localize it right you will sort

00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:07,440
you will localize it right you will sort
 

1609
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,830
you will localize it right you will sort
of force the amplitudes to could be

about the weirdness of the quantum world
 

1645
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,040
about the weirdness of the quantum world
you know or assuming that they're not

00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,050
you know or assuming that they're not
 

1647
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,990

lying to you right they are telling you
 

1649
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,720
lying to you right they are telling you
you know and yet another consequence of

1650
00:32:59,720 --> 00:32:59,730
you know and yet another consequence of
 

1651
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:02,210
you know and yet another consequence of
nature being described by these

1652
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:02,220
nature being described by these
 

1653
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,000

amplitudes so most famously what

1654
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,010
amplitudes so most famously what
 

1655
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,650
amplitudes so most famously what
amplitudes can do is that they can

1656
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:06,660
amplitudes can do is that they can
 

1657
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,290
amplitudes can do is that they can
interfere with each other okay so in the

1658
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:09,300
interfere with each other okay so in the
 

1659
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,720
interfere with each other okay so in the
famous double slit experiment what

1660
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:11,730
famous double slit experiment what
 

1661
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,670
famous double slit experiment what
happens is that you shoot a particle

1662
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:13,680
happens is that you shoot a particle
 

1663
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,070
happens is that you shoot a particle
like an electron let's say at a screen

1664
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,080
like an electron let's say at a screen
 

1665
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,740
like an electron let's say at a screen
with two slits in it and you find that

1666
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:18,750
with two slits in it and you find that
 

1667
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,380
with two slits in it and you find that
there you know on a second screen now

1668
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:21,390
there you know on a second screen now
 

1669
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,270
there you know on a second screen now
there are certain places where that

1670
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:23,280
there are certain places where that
 

1671
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,430
there are certain places where that
electron will never end up you know

1672
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:25,440
electron will never end up you know
 

1673
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,510
electron will never end up you know
after it passes through the first screen

1674
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:29,520
after it passes through the first screen
 

1675
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,240
after it passes through the first screen
and yet if I close off one of the slits

1676
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,250
and yet if I close off one of the slits
 

1677
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,400
and yet if I close off one of the slits
then the electron can appear in that

1678
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:34,410
then the electron can appear in that
 

1679
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:37,250
then the electron can appear in that
place okay so by so by decreasing the

1680
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:37,260
place okay so by so by decreasing the
 

1681
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,170
place okay so by so by decreasing the
number of paths that the electron could

1682
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:39,180
number of paths that the electron could
 

1683
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,450
number of paths that the electron could
take to get somewhere you can increase

1684
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:41,460
take to get somewhere you can increase
 

1685
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,490
take to get somewhere you can increase
the chance that it gets there okay now

1686
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:43,500
the chance that it gets there okay now
 

1687
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,260
the chance that it gets there okay now
how is that possible

1688
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:45,270
how is that possible
 

1689
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,240
how is that possible
well it's because we you know as we

1690
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:47,250
well it's because we you know as we
 

1691
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:50,180
well it's because we you know as we
would say now the electron has a

1692
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:50,190
would say now the electron has a
 

1693
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,400
would say now the electron has a
superposition state okay it has some

1694
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:52,410
superposition state okay it has some
 

1695
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:55,250
superposition state okay it has some
amplitude for reaching this point by

1696
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:55,260
amplitude for reaching this point by
 

1697
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:58,310
amplitude for reaching this point by
going through the first slit it has some

1698
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:58,320
going through the first slit it has some
 

1699
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,350
going through the first slit it has some
other amplitude for reaching it by going

1700
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:00,360
other amplitude for reaching it by going
 

1701
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,420
other amplitude for reaching it by going
through the second slit but now if one

1702
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:02,430
through the second slit but now if one
 

1703
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,410
through the second slit but now if one
amplitude is

1704
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:03,420
amplitude is
 

1705
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,090
amplitude is
positive and the other one is negative

1706
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:05,100
positive and the other one is negative
 

1707
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,310
positive and the other one is negative
then note you know I have to add them

1708
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:07,320
then note you know I have to add them
 

1709
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,780
then note you know I have to add them
all up right I have to add the

1710
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:08,790
all up right I have to add the
 

1711
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:11,150
all up right I have to add the
amplitudes for every path that the

1712
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:11,160
amplitudes for every path that the
 

1713
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,070
amplitudes for every path that the
electron could have taken to reach this

1714
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:13,080
electron could have taken to reach this
 

1715
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,040
electron could have taken to reach this
point and those amplitudes if they're

1716
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,050
point and those amplitudes if they're
 

1717
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:18,020
point and those amplitudes if they're
pointing in different directions they

1718
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:18,030
pointing in different directions they
 

1719
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:20,150
pointing in different directions they
can cancel each other out that would

1720
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:20,160
can cancel each other out that would
 

1721
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,460
can cancel each other out that would
mean the total amplitude is zero and the

1722
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:22,470
mean the total amplitude is zero and the
 

1723
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:25,010
mean the total amplitude is zero and the
thing never happens at all I closed off

1724
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:25,020
thing never happens at all I closed off
 

1725
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,750
thing never happens at all I closed off
one of the possibilities then the

1726
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:26,760
one of the possibilities then the
 

1727
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,820
one of the possibilities then the
amplitude is positive or it's negative

1728
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:28,830
amplitude is positive or it's negative
 

1729
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,740
amplitude is positive or it's negative
and now the thing can happen okay so

1730
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:30,750
and now the thing can happen okay so
 

1731
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,169
and now the thing can happen okay so
that is sort of the one trick of quantum

1732
00:34:33,169 --> 00:34:33,179
that is sort of the one trick of quantum
 

1733
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:35,419
that is sort of the one trick of quantum
mechanics and now I can tell you what a

quantum computer is okay a quantum

1736
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:37,590
quantum computer is okay a quantum
 

1737
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:41,810
quantum computer is okay a quantum

00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:48,020
exploit you know these exactly these
phenomena superposition amplitudes and

1747
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,250

00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:55,260
solve them otherwise so is the basic
 

1749
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,990
solve them otherwise so is the basic
building block of a quantum computer is

1750
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:57,000
building block of a quantum computer is
 

1751
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,750
building block of a quantum computer is
what we call a quantum bit or a qubit

1752
00:34:59,750 --> 00:34:59,760
what we call a quantum bit or a qubit
 

1753
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,910
what we call a quantum bit or a qubit
that just means a bit that has some

1754
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:01,920
that just means a bit that has some
 

1755
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,190
that just means a bit that has some
amplitude for being zero and some other

1756
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:04,200
amplitude for being zero and some other
 

1757
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,440
amplitude for being zero and some other
amplitude for being what so it's a

1758
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:06,450
amplitude for being what so it's a
 

1759
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:08,660
amplitude for being what so it's a
superposition of zero in one states

1760
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:08,670
superposition of zero in one states
 

1761
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:11,990
superposition of zero in one states
right but now the key point is that if

1762
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:12,000
right but now the key point is that if
 

1763
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,110
right but now the key point is that if
I've got let's say a thousand cubits the

1764
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:15,120
I've got let's say a thousand cubits the
 

1765
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,610
I've got let's say a thousand cubits the

00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,990
completely unequivocal that I do not
just need one amp but you know I don't

00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:22,830
just need amplitudes for each qubit
 

1773
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:25,340
just need amplitudes for each qubit

okay you know you know that that sounds

1822
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:19,910
okay you know you know that that sounds
 

1823
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:22,690
okay you know you know that that sounds
too good to be true and unfortunately it

1824
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:22,700
too good to be true and unfortunately it
 

1825
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,240
too good to be true and unfortunately it
kind of is too good to be true that the

1826
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:25,250
kind of is too good to be true that the
 

1827
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,579
kind of is too good to be true that the
problem is I could make a superposition

00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:34,779
you know even if there were two to the
one thousand of them right I can I can

00:36:34,779 --> 00:36:34,789
one thousand of them right I can I can
 

1835
00:36:34,789 --> 00:36:37,029
one thousand of them right I can I can
easily do that the trouble is for a

computer to be useful you've got at some
 

1839
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,990
computer to be useful you've got at some
point you've got to look at it and see

00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:41,000
point you've got to look at it and see
 

1841
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,150
point you've got to look at it and see
and see an output right and if I just

1842
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:43,160
and see an output right and if I just
 

1843
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,670
and see an output right and if I just
measure a superposition over every

00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:47,660
possible answer then the rules of
 

1847
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,450
possible answer then the rules of
quantum mechanics tell me that all I'll

1848
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:49,460
quantum mechanics tell me that all I'll
 

1849
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,940
quantum mechanics tell me that all I'll
see will be a random answer you know if

1850
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:51,950
see will be a random answer you know if
 

1851
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,470
see will be a random answer you know if
I just wanted a random answer well I

1852
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:53,480
I just wanted a random answer well I
 

1853
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,120
I just wanted a random answer well I
could have picked one myself with a lot

1854
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:55,130
could have picked one myself with a lot
 

1855
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,059
could have picked one myself with a lot
less trouble right so the entire trick

right I mean the bit is you know the
basic unit of information since you know

1904
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:55,910
basic unit of information since you know
 

1905
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:59,289
basic unit of information since you know
Claude Shannon's paper in 1948 you know

1906
00:37:59,289 --> 00:37:59,299
Claude Shannon's paper in 1948 you know
 

1907
00:37:59,299 --> 00:38:00,549
Claude Shannon's paper in 1948 you know
and you know of course you know people

1908
00:38:00,549 --> 00:38:00,559
and you know of course you know people
 

1909
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:02,410
and you know of course you know people
had the concept even before that you

1910
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:02,420
had the concept even before that you
 

1911
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:05,470
had the concept even before that you
know he popularized the name right but I

1912
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:05,480
know he popularized the name right but I
 

1913
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,990
know he popularized the name right but I
mean but a bit at zero or one that's

1914
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:08,000
mean but a bit at zero or one that's
 

1915
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,970
mean but a bit at zero or one that's
right basically that's right and what we

1916
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:09,980
right basically that's right and what we
 

1917
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,950
right basically that's right and what we
would say is that the basic unit of

1918
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:11,960
would say is that the basic unit of
 

1919
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,950
would say is that the basic unit of
quantum information is the qubit is you

1920
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:14,960
quantum information is the qubit is you
 

1921
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,650
quantum information is the qubit is you
know the object any object that can be

1922
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:17,660
know the object any object that can be
 

1923
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:21,160
know the object any object that can be

1925
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:24,789
maintained tennis manipulated in a
superposition of 0 and 1 States now you

1926
00:38:24,789 --> 00:38:24,799
superposition of 0 and 1 States now you
 

1927
00:38:24,799 --> 00:38:26,890
superposition of 0 and 1 States now you
know sometimes people ask well but but

1928
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:26,900
know sometimes people ask well but but
 

1929
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,050
know sometimes people ask well but but
but what is a qubit physically

1930
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:29,060
but what is a qubit physically
 

1931
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,120
but what is a qubit physically
and there are all these different you

1932
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,130
and there are all these different you
 

1933
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:34,090
and there are all these different you
know proposals that are being pursued in

quantum computing that was in the news

1940
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:40,820
quantum computing that was in the news
 

1941
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,390

recently because of Google's the quantum
 

1943
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,450

supremacy experiment right where you

1944
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:46,460
supremacy experiment right where you
 

1945
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:49,890
supremacy experiment right where you
would have some little coils where a

1946
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:49,900
would have some little coils where a
 

1947
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,690
would have some little coils where a
current can flow through them in two

1948
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:52,700
current can flow through them in two
 

1949
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,240
current can flow through them in two
different energy states one representing

1950
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:55,250
different energy states one representing
 

1951
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,910
different energy states one representing
a 0 another representing the 1 and if

1952
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:57,920
a 0 another representing the 1 and if
 

1953
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,220
a 0 another representing the 1 and if
you cool these coils to just slightly

1954
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:00,230
you cool these coils to just slightly
 

1955
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:03,010
you cool these coils to just slightly
above absolute zero like a hundredth of

1956
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:03,020
above absolute zero like a hundredth of
 

1957
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,590
above absolute zero like a hundredth of
a degree then they super conduct and

1958
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:05,600
a degree then they super conduct and
 

1959
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,540
a degree then they super conduct and
then the current can actually be in a

1960
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:07,550
then the current can actually be in a
 

1961
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,130
then the current can actually be in a
superposition of the two different

superposition of the two different
 

1963
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:12,280
superposition of the two different
states so that's one kind of qubit

1964
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:12,290
states so that's one kind of qubit
 

1965
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:15,100
states so that's one kind of qubit
another kind would be you know just in

00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:36,010
the all the quantum computers we can
build today are very noisy right and so

2035
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:41,470
sort of the the the you know the qubits
are very far from perfect and so the

00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:41,480
are very far from perfect and so the
 

2037
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,620
are very far from perfect and so the

lower level sort of
 

2039
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,480

affect the higher levels and we sort of
 

2041
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:46,130
affect the higher levels and we sort of
have to think about all of them at once

00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:46,140
have to think about all of them at once
 

2043
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:49,099
have to think about all of them at once
okay but eventually where we hope to get

okay but eventually where we hope to get
 

2045
00:40:49,109 --> 00:40:51,289
okay but eventually where we hope to get

00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,950
already Street or sort of prove theorems
about or think about today but in that

2060
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:06,960
about or think about today but in that
 

2061
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,099
about or think about today but in that
future the the logic of it really does

2062
00:41:10,099 --> 00:41:10,109
future the the logic of it really does
 

2063
00:41:10,109 --> 00:41:12,049
future the the logic of it really does
become decoupled from the hardware

2064
00:41:12,049 --> 00:41:12,059
become decoupled from the hardware
 

2065
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:14,660
become decoupled from the hardware
so if noise is currently like the

2066
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:14,670
so if noise is currently like the
 

2067
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:17,359
so if noise is currently like the
biggest problem for quantum computing

2068
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:17,369
biggest problem for quantum computing
 

2069
00:41:17,369 --> 00:41:21,710
biggest problem for quantum computing
and then the dream is error correcting

2070
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:21,720
and then the dream is error correcting
 

2071
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,589
and then the dream is error correcting
modern computers can you just maybe

2072
00:41:24,589 --> 00:41:24,599
modern computers can you just maybe
 

2073
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:27,079
modern computers can you just maybe
describe what does it mean for there to

2074
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:27,089
describe what does it mean for there to
 

2075
00:41:27,089 --> 00:41:28,849
describe what does it mean for there to
be noise in the system

2076
00:41:28,849 --> 00:41:28,859
be noise in the system
 

2077
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:31,279
be noise in the system
absolutely so yeah so the problem is

2078
00:41:31,279 --> 00:41:31,289
absolutely so yeah so the problem is
 

2079
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:32,990
absolutely so yeah so the problem is
even a little more specific than noise

2080
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,000
even a little more specific than noise
 

2081
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,390
even a little more specific than noise
so that the fundamental problem if

2082
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:35,400
so that the fundamental problem if
 

2083
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,370
so that the fundamental problem if
you're trying to actually build a

00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,769
you're trying to actually build a

quantum computer you know of any
 

2087
00:41:39,779 --> 00:41:42,319
quantum computer you know of any
appreciable size is something called

2088
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:42,329
appreciable size is something called
 

2089
00:41:42,329 --> 00:41:45,049
appreciable size is something called
decoherence okay and this was recognized

2090
00:41:45,049 --> 00:41:45,059
decoherence okay and this was recognized
 

2091
00:41:45,059 --> 00:41:46,700
decoherence okay and this was recognized
from the very beginning you know when

2092
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:46,710
from the very beginning you know when
 

2093
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,440
from the very beginning you know when
people first started thinking about this

2094
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:48,450
people first started thinking about this
 

2095
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:52,249
people first started thinking about this
in the 1990s now what decoherence means

2096
00:41:52,249 --> 00:41:52,259
in the 1990s now what decoherence means
 

2097
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:55,039
in the 1990s now what decoherence means
is sort of unwanted interaction between

2098
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:55,049
is sort of unwanted interaction between
 

2099
00:41:55,049 --> 00:41:57,710
is sort of unwanted interaction between
you know your qubits you know the state

2100
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:57,720
you know your qubits you know the state
 

2101
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,599
you know your qubits you know the state
of your quantum computer and the

2102
00:41:59,599 --> 00:41:59,609
of your quantum computer and the
 

2103
00:41:59,609 --> 00:42:01,789
of your quantum computer and the
external environment okay and why is

2104
00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:01,799
external environment okay and why is
 

2105
00:42:01,799 --> 00:42:04,099
external environment okay and why is
that such a problem why I said talked

2106
00:42:04,099 --> 00:42:04,109
that such a problem why I said talked
 

2107
00:42:04,109 --> 00:42:05,599
that such a problem why I said talked
before about how you know when you

2108
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:05,609
before about how you know when you
 

2109
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:08,359
before about how you know when you
measure a quantum system so let's say if

2110
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:08,369
measure a quantum system so let's say if
 

2111
00:42:08,369 --> 00:42:10,430
measure a quantum system so let's say if
I measure a qubit that's in a

2112
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:10,440
I measure a qubit that's in a
 

2113
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,589
I measure a qubit that's in a
superposition of 0 and 1 States to ask

2114
00:42:12,589 --> 00:42:12,599
superposition of 0 and 1 States to ask
 

2115
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:14,420
superposition of 0 and 1 States to ask
it you know are you zero or are you one

2116
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:14,430
it you know are you zero or are you one
 

2117
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:16,430
it you know are you zero or are you one
well now I force it to make up its mind

2118
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:16,440
well now I force it to make up its mind
 

2119
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,130
well now I force it to make up its mind
right and now probabilistically it

2120
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:19,140
right and now probabilistically it
 

2121
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,440
right and now probabilistically it
chooses one or the other and now you

2122
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:21,450
chooses one or the other and now you
 

2123
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:23,059
chooses one or the other and now you
know it's no longer a superposition

2124
00:42:23,059 --> 00:42:23,069
know it's no longer a superposition
 

2125
00:42:23,069 --> 00:42:25,339
know it's no longer a superposition
there's no longer amplitudes there's

2126
00:42:25,339 --> 00:42:25,349
there's no longer amplitudes there's
 

2127
00:42:25,349 --> 00:42:27,019
there's no longer amplitudes there's
just there's some probability that I get

2128
00:42:27,019 --> 00:42:27,029
just there's some probability that I get
 

2129
00:42:27,029 --> 00:42:29,410
just there's some probability that I get
a zero and there's some that I get a one

2130
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:29,420
a zero and there's some that I get a one
 

2131
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:33,890
a zero and there's some that I get a one
and now the the the the the trouble is

2132
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:33,900
and now the the the the the trouble is
 

2133
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,509
and now the the the the the trouble is
that it doesn't have to be me who's

2134
00:42:35,509 --> 00:42:35,519
that it doesn't have to be me who's
 

2135
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,220
that it doesn't have to be me who's
looking guy or in fact it doesn't have

2136
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:37,230
looking guy or in fact it doesn't have
 

2137
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:41,240
looking guy or in fact it doesn't have
to be any conscious entity any kind of

2138
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:41,250
to be any conscious entity any kind of
 

2139
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:44,120
to be any conscious entity any kind of
interaction with the external world that

2140
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:44,130
interaction with the external world that
 

2141
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:47,359
interaction with the external world that
leaks out the information about whether

2142
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:47,369
leaks out the information about whether
 

2143
00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:50,420
leaks out the information about whether
this qubit was a 0 or a 1 sort of that

2144
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:50,430
this qubit was a 0 or a 1 sort of that
 

2145
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:53,509
this qubit was a 0 or a 1 sort of that
causes the zero Ness or the oneness of

2146
00:42:53,509 --> 00:42:53,519
causes the zero Ness or the oneness of
 

2147
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:56,059
causes the zero Ness or the oneness of
the qubit to be recorded

2148
00:42:56,059 --> 00:42:56,069
the qubit to be recorded
 

2149
00:42:56,069 --> 00:42:58,370
the qubit to be recorded
you know the radiation in the room in

2150
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:58,380
you know the radiation in the room in
 

2151
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:02,059
you know the radiation in the room in
the molecules of the air in the wires

2152
00:43:02,059 --> 00:43:02,069
the molecules of the air in the wires
 

2153
00:43:02,069 --> 00:43:04,370
the molecules of the air in the wires
that are connected to my device any of

2154
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:04,380
that are connected to my device any of
 

2155
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:07,430
that are connected to my device any of
that as soon as the information leaks

2156
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:07,440
that as soon as the information leaks
 

2157
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,769
that as soon as the information leaks
out it is as if that qubit has been

2158
00:43:09,769 --> 00:43:09,779
out it is as if that qubit has been
 

2159
00:43:09,779 --> 00:43:12,620
out it is as if that qubit has been
measured okay it is you know the the the

2160
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:12,630
measured okay it is you know the the the
 

2161
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:15,650
measured okay it is you know the the the
state has now collapsed you know another

2162
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:15,660
state has now collapsed you know another
 

2163
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,029
state has now collapsed you know another
way to say it is that it's become

2164
00:43:17,029 --> 00:43:17,039
way to say it is that it's become
 

2165
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:19,670
way to say it is that it's become
entangled with its environment okay but

2166
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:19,680
entangled with its environment okay but
 

2167
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,799
entangled with its environment okay but
you know from the perspective of someone

2168
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:21,809
you know from the perspective of someone
 

2169
00:43:21,809 --> 00:43:24,140
you know from the perspective of someone
who's just looking at this qubit it is

2170
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:24,150
who's just looking at this qubit it is
 

2171
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:26,239
who's just looking at this qubit it is
as though it has lost its quantum state

2172
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:26,249
as though it has lost its quantum state
 

2173
00:43:26,249 --> 00:43:29,180
as though it has lost its quantum state
and so what this means is that if I want

2174
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:29,190
and so what this means is that if I want
 

2175
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:32,299
and so what this means is that if I want
to do a quantum computation I have to

2176
00:43:32,299 --> 00:43:32,309
to do a quantum computation I have to
 

2177
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:35,059
to do a quantum computation I have to
keep the qubits sort of fanatically well

2178
00:43:35,059 --> 00:43:35,069
keep the qubits sort of fanatically well
 

2179
00:43:35,069 --> 00:43:37,819
keep the qubits sort of fanatically well
isolated from their environment but then

2180
00:43:37,819 --> 00:43:37,829
isolated from their environment but then
 

2181
00:43:37,829 --> 00:43:39,650
isolated from their environment but then
at the same time they can't be perfectly

2182
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:39,660
at the same time they can't be perfectly
 

2183
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,479
at the same time they can't be perfectly
isolated because I need to tell them

2184
00:43:41,479 --> 00:43:41,489
isolated because I need to tell them
 

2185
00:43:41,489 --> 00:43:44,089
isolated because I need to tell them
what to do I need to make them interact

2186
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:44,099
what to do I need to make them interact
 

2187
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:46,189
what to do I need to make them interact
with each other for one thing and not

2188
00:43:46,189 --> 00:43:46,199
with each other for one thing and not
 

2189
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:47,930
with each other for one thing and not
only that but in a precisely

2190
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:47,940
only that but in a precisely
 

2191
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,930
only that but in a precisely
choreographed way okay and you know that

2192
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:50,940
choreographed way okay and you know that
 

2193
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,660
choreographed way okay and you know that
is such a staggering problem right how

2194
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:53,670
is such a staggering problem right how
 

2195
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:55,819
is such a staggering problem right how
do i isolate these qubits from the whole

2196
00:43:55,819 --> 00:43:55,829
do i isolate these qubits from the whole
 

2197
00:43:55,829 --> 00:43:57,620
do i isolate these qubits from the whole
universe but then also tell them exactly

2198
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:57,630
universe but then also tell them exactly
 

2199
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:59,599
universe but then also tell them exactly
what to do I mean you know there were

2200
00:43:59,599 --> 00:43:59,609
what to do I mean you know there were
 

2201
00:43:59,609 --> 00:44:02,150
what to do I mean you know there were
distinguished physicists and computer

2202
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:02,160
distinguished physicists and computer
 

2203
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,029

00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:07,249
scientists in the 90s who said this is
fundamentally impossible you know the

00:44:07,249 --> 00:44:07,259
fundamentally impossible you know the
 

2207
00:44:07,259 --> 00:44:09,199
fundamentally impossible you know the

changed the views of most of us was a

2214
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:17,940
changed the views of most of us was a
 

2215
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:21,259
changed the views of most of us was a
profound discovery in the mid to late

2216
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:21,269
profound discovery in the mid to late
 

2217
00:44:21,269 --> 00:44:23,599
profound discovery in the mid to late
90s which was called the theory of

2218
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:23,609
90s which was called the theory of
 

2219
00:44:23,609 --> 00:44:26,029
90s which was called the theory of
quantum error correction and quantum

2220
00:44:26,029 --> 00:44:26,039
quantum error correction and quantum
 

2221
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:28,459
quantum error correction and quantum
fault tolerance okay and the upshot of

2222
00:44:28,459 --> 00:44:28,469
fault tolerance okay and the upshot of
 

2223
00:44:28,469 --> 00:44:31,489
fault tolerance okay and the upshot of
that theory is that if I want to build a

2224
00:44:31,489 --> 00:44:31,499
that theory is that if I want to build a
 

2225
00:44:31,499 --> 00:44:34,430
that theory is that if I want to build a
reliable quantum computer and scale it

2226
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:34,440
reliable quantum computer and scale it
 

2227
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,680
reliable quantum computer and scale it
up to you know an arbitrary number of as

2228
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:36,690
up to you know an arbitrary number of as
 

2229
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:39,199
up to you know an arbitrary number of as
many qubits as I want you know and doing

2230
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:39,209
many qubits as I want you know and doing
 

2231
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:41,749
many qubits as I want you know and doing
as much on them as I want I do not

00:44:41,749 --> 00:44:41,759
as much on them as I want I do not
 

2233
00:44:41,759 --> 00:44:43,549

actually have to get the cube it's

2234
00:44:43,549 --> 00:44:43,559
actually have to get the cube it's
 

2235
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:45,559
actually have to get the cube it's
perfectly isolated from their

00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:45,569
perfectly isolated from their
 

2237
00:44:45,569 --> 00:44:47,269
perfectly isolated from their

2239
00:44:47,279 --> 00:44:49,969

really really really well isolated okay

2240
00:44:49,969 --> 00:44:49,979
really really really well isolated okay
 

2241
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:53,959
really really really well isolated okay
and even if every qubit is sort of

2242
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:53,969
and even if every qubit is sort of
 

2243
00:44:53,969 --> 00:44:56,059
and even if every qubit is sort of
leaking you know it state into the

00:45:04,459 --> 00:45:04,469
encode the information that I care about
 

2251
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:07,309
encode the information that I care about
in very clever ways across the

in very clever ways across the
 

2253
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:09,800

00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:12,210
okay in such a way that even if you know
 

2257
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,360

2263
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,320

from the remaining qubits okay and so

from the remaining qubits okay and so
 

2269
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,970

research from the 1990s until the

research from the 1990s until the
 

2281
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,350
research from the 1990s until the
present okay the goal has been you know

engineer qubits that are not perfectly

00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:48,300
engineer qubits that are not perfectly
 

2285
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,990
engineer qubits that are not perfectly
reliable but reliable enough that you

2286
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:51,000
reliable but reliable enough that you
 

2287
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,090
reliable but reliable enough that you
can then use these error correcting

2288
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:53,100
can then use these error correcting
 

2289
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:56,300
can then use these error correcting
codes to have them simulate qubits that

2290
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:56,310
codes to have them simulate qubits that
 

2291
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:58,250
codes to have them simulate qubits that
are even more reliable than they are

2292
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:58,260
are even more reliable than they are
 

2293
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,440
are even more reliable than they are
regarded the error correction becomes a

2294
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:00,450
regarded the error correction becomes a
 

2295
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:02,810
regarded the error correction becomes a
net win rather than a net loss right and

2296
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:02,820
net win rather than a net loss right and
 

2297
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,520
net win rather than a net loss right and
then once you reach that sort of

2298
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:04,530
then once you reach that sort of
 

2299
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:07,040
then once you reach that sort of
crossover point then you know your

2300
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:07,050
crossover point then you know your
 

2301
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:09,680
crossover point then you know your
simulated qubits could in turn simulate

2302
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:09,690
simulated qubits could in turn simulate
 

2303
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:11,720
simulated qubits could in turn simulate
qubits that are even more reliable and

2304
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:11,730
qubits that are even more reliable and
 

2305
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:13,610
qubits that are even more reliable and
so on until you've just you know

2306
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:13,620
so on until you've just you know
 

2307
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:15,620
so on until you've just you know
effectively you have arbitrarily

effectively you have arbitrarily
 

2309
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:18,350
effectively you have arbitrarily
reliable cubans so long story short we

2310
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:18,360
reliable cubans so long story short we
 

2311
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,450

are not at that break-even point yet

00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:20,460
are not at that break-even point yet
 

2313
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,460
are not at that break-even point yet
we're a hell of a lot closer than we

00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:23,970
were when people started doing this in
 

2317
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:26,210
were when people started doing this in
the 90s like orders of magnitude closer

so so so the way I would say it is that

2334
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:46,350
so so so the way I would say it is that
 

2335
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:48,980
so so so the way I would say it is that

thousands of physical qubits so at that
 

2377
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:34,640
thousands of physical qubits so at that
point you're talking about millions of

point you're talking about millions of
 

2379
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:36,920
point you're talking about millions of
physical qubits and in some sense that

physical qubits and in some sense that
 

2381
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:39,140

a million things well backtrack for a
 

2475
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,099
a million things well backtrack for a
sec yeah sure sure so we're in these

2476
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:28,109
sec yeah sure sure so we're in these
 

2477
00:49:28,109 --> 00:49:30,079
sec yeah sure sure so we're in these
vacuum tube days yeah

vacuum tube days yeah
 

2479
00:49:30,089 --> 00:49:32,839
vacuum tube days yeah
just entering and I'm just entering Wow

just entering and I'm just entering Wow
 

2481
00:49:32,849 --> 00:49:36,380
just entering and I'm just entering Wow
okay so yeah how do we escape the vacuum

2482
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:36,390
okay so yeah how do we escape the vacuum
 

2483
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:37,090
okay so yeah how do we escape the vacuum
so

2484

all of the above yeah I mean my my guess
 

2509
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:12,430
all of the above yeah I mean my my guess
you know I mean I mean you know you

00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:12,440
you know I mean I mean you know you
 

2511
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,840
you know I mean I mean you know you
could say fundamentally it is an

engineering issue right the theory has

2514
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:15,950
engineering issue right the theory has
 

2515
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:18,520
engineering issue right the theory has
been in place since the 90s you know at

2516
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:18,530
been in place since the 90s you know at
 

2517
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:21,310
been in place since the 90s you know at
least you know you know this is what you

2518
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:21,320
least you know you know this is what you
 

2519
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,720
least you know you know this is what you
know error correction what you know

2520
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:22,730
know error correction what you know
 

2521
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:24,460
know error correction what you know
would look like you know we we do not

2522
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:24,470
would look like you know we we do not
 

2523
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:26,290
would look like you know we we do not
have the hardware that is at that level

2524
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:26,300
have the hardware that is at that level
 

2525
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,720
have the hardware that is at that level
but at the same time you know so you

2526
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:28,730
but at the same time you know so you
 

2527
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:31,870
but at the same time you know so you
could just you know try to power through

2528
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:31,880
could just you know try to power through
 

2529
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,480
could just you know try to power through
you know maybe even like you know if

2530
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:34,490
you know maybe even like you know if
 

2531
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:36,940
you know maybe even like you know if
someone spent a trillion dollars on some

right then conceivably they could just

2536
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:42,380
right then conceivably they could just
 

2537
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:45,520
right then conceivably they could just
you know build a an error corrected

2538
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:45,530
you know build a an error corrected
 

2539
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:47,650
you know build a an error corrected

back in the 90s right I think the more

2542
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:50,480
back in the 90s right I think the more
 

2543
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,140
back in the 90s right I think the more
plausible thing to happen is that there

2544
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:53,150
plausible thing to happen is that there
 

2545
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:54,880
plausible thing to happen is that there
will be further theoretical

2546
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:54,890
will be further theoretical
 

2547
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:56,260
will be further theoretical
breakthroughs and there will be further

2548
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:56,270
breakthroughs and there will be further
 

2549
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:59,110
breakthroughs and there will be further
insights that will cut down the cost of

2550
00:50:59,110 --> 00:50:59,120
insights that will cut down the cost of
 

2551
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,150
insights that will cut down the cost of
doing this so let's take good briefs

00:53:51,069 --> 00:53:53,130
the computers that we have today are the
same as the ones in the 50s they're just

2682
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:53,140
same as the ones in the 50s they're just
 

2683
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:55,740
same as the ones in the 50s they're just
millions of times you know faster and

2684
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:55,750
millions of times you know faster and
 

2685
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:57,359
millions of times you know faster and
with millions of times more memory and

2686
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:57,369
with millions of times more memory and
 

2687
00:53:57,369 --> 00:53:59,460
with millions of times more memory and
you know I mean I think there's been an

2688
00:53:59,460 --> 00:53:59,470
you know I mean I think there's been an
 

2689
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:02,370
you know I mean I think there's been an
immense economic pressure to you know

2690
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:02,380
immense economic pressure to you know
 

2691
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:04,680
immense economic pressure to you know
get more and more transistors you know

2692
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:04,690
get more and more transistors you know
 

2693
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:07,380
get more and more transistors you know
get them smaller and smaller get you add

2694
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:07,390
get them smaller and smaller get you add
 

2695
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:10,680
get them smaller and smaller get you add
more and more cores and you know and and

2696
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:10,690
more and more cores and you know and and
 

2697
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:13,830
more and more cores and you know and and
and and in in in some sense like a huge

2698
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:13,840
and and in in in some sense like a huge
 

2699
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,390
and and in in in some sense like a huge
fraction of sort of all of the

2700
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:15,400
fraction of sort of all of the
 

2701
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,790
fraction of sort of all of the
technological progress that there is in

2702
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:17,800
technological progress that there is in
 

2703
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,800
technological progress that there is in
all of civilization has gotten

2704
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:19,810
all of civilization has gotten
 

2705
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:22,680
all of civilization has gotten
concentrated just more narrowly into

2706
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:22,690
concentrated just more narrowly into
 

2707
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:25,350
concentrated just more narrowly into
just those problems right and so you

2708
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:25,360
just those problems right and so you
 

2709
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:28,200
just those problems right and so you
know it has been one of the biggest

2710
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:28,210
know it has been one of the biggest
 

2711
00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:30,270
know it has been one of the biggest
success stories in the history of

2712
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:30,280
success stories in the history of
 

2713
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,250
success stories in the history of
technology right there's you know I mean

2714
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:32,260
technology right there's you know I mean
 

2715
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:35,550
technology right there's you know I mean
it is I am as amazed by it as anyone

2716
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:35,560
it is I am as amazed by it as anyone
 

2717
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,400
it is I am as amazed by it as anyone
elses right but at the same time you

2718
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:38,410
elses right but at the same time you
 

2719
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:41,780
elses right but at the same time you
know we also know that it you know and I

2720
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:41,790
know we also know that it you know and I
 

2721
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:46,140
know we also know that it you know and I
I really do mean we know that it cannot

2722
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:46,150
I really do mean we know that it cannot
 

2723
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:49,470
I really do mean we know that it cannot
continue indefinitely okay because you

2724
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:49,480
continue indefinitely okay because you
 

2725
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,840
continue indefinitely okay because you
will reach you know fundamental limits

2726
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:51,850
will reach you know fundamental limits
 

2727
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:55,200
will reach you know fundamental limits
on you know how small you can possibly

2728
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:55,210
on you know how small you can possibly
 

2729
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:57,570
on you know how small you can possibly
make a processor and you know if you

2730
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:57,580
make a processor and you know if you
 

2731
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:59,370
make a processor and you know if you
want a real proof you know that would

2732
00:54:59,370 --> 00:54:59,380
want a real proof you know that would
 

2733
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,560
want a real proof you know that would
justify my use of the word you know we

2734
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:01,570
justify my use of the word you know we
 

2735
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:03,660
justify my use of the word you know we
know that you know Moore's law has to

2736
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:03,670
know that you know Moore's law has to
 

2737
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:05,940
know that you know Moore's law has to
end I mean ultimately you will reach the

2738
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:05,950
end I mean ultimately you will reach the
 

2739
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:08,430
end I mean ultimately you will reach the
limits imposed by quantum gravity you

2740
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:08,440
limits imposed by quantum gravity you
 

2741
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:11,160
limits imposed by quantum gravity you
know you know if you were doing if you

2742
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:11,170
know you know if you were doing if you
 

2743
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:13,470
know you know if you were doing if you
tried to build a computer that operated

2744
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:13,480
tried to build a computer that operated
 

2745
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,530
tried to build a computer that operated
at 10 to the 43 Hertz so did 10 to the

2746
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:16,540
at 10 to the 43 Hertz so did 10 to the
 

2747
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:19,470
at 10 to the 43 Hertz so did 10 to the
43 operations per second that computer

2748
00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:19,480
43 operations per second that computer
 

2749
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,270
43 operations per second that computer
would use so much energy that it would

2750
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:21,280
would use so much energy that it would
 

2751
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,660
would use so much energy that it would
simply collapse to a black hole okay so

2752
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:24,670
simply collapse to a black hole okay so
 

2753
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:26,370
simply collapse to a black hole okay so
you know that you know we you know in

2754
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:26,380
you know that you know we you know in
 

2755
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:28,620
you know that you know we you know in
reality we're going to reach the limits

2756
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:28,630
reality we're going to reach the limits
 

2757
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:30,660
reality we're going to reach the limits
long before that but you know that is a

2758
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:30,670
long before that but you know that is a
 

2759
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:32,790
long before that but you know that is a
sufficient proof that there's a limit

2760
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:32,800
sufficient proof that there's a limit
 

2761
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:37,020
sufficient proof that there's a limit
yes yes but it would be interesting to

2762
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:37,030
yes yes but it would be interesting to
 

2763
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:39,300
yes yes but it would be interesting to
try to understand the mechanism the

2764
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:39,310
try to understand the mechanism the
 

2765
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:41,400
try to understand the mechanism the
economic pressure these said just like

2766
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:41,410
economic pressure these said just like
 

2767
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:44,280
economic pressure these said just like
the Cold War was a pressure on getting

2768
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:44,290
the Cold War was a pressure on getting
 

2769
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:48,810
the Cold War was a pressure on getting
us getting us cuz I'm both my us is both

2770
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:48,820
us getting us cuz I'm both my us is both
 

2771
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:51,060
us getting us cuz I'm both my us is both
the Soviet Union and the United States

2772
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:51,070
the Soviet Union and the United States
 

2773
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:53,970
the Soviet Union and the United States
yeah getting us the two countries to get

2774
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:53,980
yeah getting us the two countries to get
 

2775
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:56,250
yeah getting us the two countries to get
to hurry up to get the space to the moon

2776
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:56,260
to hurry up to get the space to the moon
 

2777
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:58,230
to hurry up to get the space to the moon
there seems to be that same kind of

2778
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:58,240
there seems to be that same kind of
 

2779
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,750
there seems to be that same kind of
economic pressure that somehow created a

2780
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:00,760
economic pressure that somehow created a
 

2781
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:03,870
economic pressure that somehow created a
chain of engineering breakthroughs there

2782
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:03,880
chain of engineering breakthroughs there
 

2783
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,390
chain of engineering breakthroughs there
resulted in the Moore's law yeah what'd

2784
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:06,400
resulted in the Moore's law yeah what'd
 

2785
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,040
resulted in the Moore's law yeah what'd
be nice to replicate yeah well I mean I

2786
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:08,050
be nice to replicate yeah well I mean I
 

2787
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:10,920
be nice to replicate yeah well I mean I
mean some people are sort of get

2788
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:10,930
mean some people are sort of get
 

2789
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:12,360
mean some people are sort of get
depressed about the fact that

00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:12,130
compromise dude that's right that's
 

2837
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:14,190
compromise dude that's right that's
right and but but the basic idea is

2838
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:14,200
right and but but the basic idea is
 

2839
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,930
right and but but the basic idea is
actually one that goes all the way back

2840
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:15,940
actually one that goes all the way back
 

2841
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:18,210
actually one that goes all the way back
to the beginnings of quantum computing

2842
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:18,220
to the beginnings of quantum computing
 

2843
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,700
to the beginnings of quantum computing
when richard fineman and david deutsch

when richard fineman and david deutsch
 

2845
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:22,410
when richard fineman and david deutsch
people like that we're talking about it

2846
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:22,420
people like that we're talking about it
 

2847
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:25,890
people like that we're talking about it
in the early 80s and-and-and and quantum

2848
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:25,900
in the early 80s and-and-and and quantum

in the early 80s and-and-and and quantum
supremacy just refers to sort of the

2850
00:57:28,049 --> 00:57:28,059
supremacy just refers to sort of the
 

2851
00:57:28,059 --> 00:57:30,720
supremacy just refers to sort of the
point in history when you can first use

2852
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:30,730
point in history when you can first use
 

2853
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:33,120
point in history when you can first use
a quantum computer to do some

2854
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:33,130
a quantum computer to do some
 

2855
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:36,900
a quantum computer to do some
well-defined task much faster than any

2856
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:36,910
well-defined task much faster than any
 

2857
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:39,539
well-defined task much faster than any
known algorithm running on any of the

00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:39,549
known algorithm running on any of the
 

2859
00:57:39,549 --> 00:57:40,980
known algorithm running on any of the
classical computers that are available

classical computers that are available
 

2861
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:43,950
classical computers that are available
okay so you know notice that I did not

2862
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:43,960
okay so you know notice that I did not
 

2863
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,859
okay so you know notice that I did not
say a useful task okay you know it could

2864
00:57:46,859 --> 00:57:46,869
say a useful task okay you know it could
 

2865
00:57:46,869 --> 00:57:49,230
say a useful task okay you know it could
be something completely artificial but

2866
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:49,240
be something completely artificial but
 

2867
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,970
be something completely artificial but
it's important that the task be

2868
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:50,980
it's important that the task be
 

2869
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:53,130
it's important that the task be
well-defined so in other words you know

2870
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:53,140
well-defined so in other words you know
 

2871
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,019
well-defined so in other words you know
there is it is something that has right

2872
00:57:55,019 --> 00:57:55,029
there is it is something that has right
 

2873
00:57:55,029 --> 00:57:57,510
there is it is something that has right
and wrong answers you know and that are

2874
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:57,520
and wrong answers you know and that are
 

2875
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,730
and wrong answers you know and that are
knowable independently of this device

2876
00:57:59,730 --> 00:57:59,740
knowable independently of this device
 

2877
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:01,890
knowable independently of this device
right and we can then you know run the

2878
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:01,900
right and we can then you know run the
 

2879
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,510
right and we can then you know run the
device see if it gets the right answer

2880
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:03,520
device see if it gets the right answer
 

2881
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,150
device see if it gets the right answer
or not can you clarify a small point you

2882
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:06,160
or not can you clarify a small point you
 

2883
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,069
or not can you clarify a small point you
said much faster than a classical

2884
00:58:08,069 --> 00:58:08,079
said much faster than a classical
 

2885
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:12,150
said much faster than a classical
implementation what about sort of what

2886
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:12,160
implementation what about sort of what
 

2887
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,559
implementation what about sort of what
about the space with where the class

2888
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:13,569
about the space with where the class
 

2889
00:58:13,569 --> 00:58:15,690
about the space with where the class
there's no there's not it doesn't even

2890
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:15,700
there's no there's not it doesn't even
 

2891
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,079
there's no there's not it doesn't even
exist a classical algorithm so so so so

2892
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:19,089
exist a classical algorithm so so so so
 

2893
00:58:19,089 --> 00:58:21,420
exist a classical algorithm so so so so
maybe I should clarify everything that a

2894
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:21,430
maybe I should clarify everything that a
 

2895
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:23,730
maybe I should clarify everything that a
quantum computer can do a classical

2896
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:23,740
quantum computer can do a classical
 

2897
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:26,730
quantum computer can do a classical
computer can also eventually do okay and

2898
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:26,740
computer can also eventually do okay and
 

2899
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:28,980
computer can also eventually do okay and
the reason why we know that is

2900
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:28,990
the reason why we know that is
 

2901
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:31,830
the reason why we know that is
that a a classical computer could always

2902
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:31,840
that a a classical computer could always
 

2903
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,710
that a a classical computer could always
you know if it had no limits of time and

2904
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:34,720
you know if it had no limits of time and
 

2905
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,320
you know if it had no limits of time and
memory it could always just store the

2906
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:37,330
memory it could always just store the
 

2907
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:39,990
memory it could always just store the
entire quantum state you know of your

2908
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:40,000
entire quantum state you know of your
 

2909
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,050
entire quantum state you know of your
you know of the quantum store in a list

2910
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:43,060
you know of the quantum store in a list
 

2911
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:45,870
you know of the quantum store in a list
of all the amplitudes you know in the

2912
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:45,880
of all the amplitudes you know in the
 

2913
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,609
of all the amplitudes you know in the
state of the quantum computer and then

2914
00:58:47,609 --> 00:58:47,619
state of the quantum computer and then
 

2915
00:58:47,619 --> 00:58:50,220
state of the quantum computer and then
just you know do some linear algebra to

2916
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:50,230
just you know do some linear algebra to
 

2917
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:53,040
just you know do some linear algebra to
just update that state right and so so

2918
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,050
just update that state right and so so
 

2919
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:55,140
just update that state right and so so
anything that quantum computers can do

2920
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:55,150
anything that quantum computers can do
 

2921
00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:58,260
anything that quantum computers can do
can also be done by classical computers

2922
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:58,270
can also be done by classical computers
 

2923
00:58:58,270 --> 00:59:01,440
can also be done by classical computers
albeit exponentially slower okay so on

2924
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:01,450
albeit exponentially slower okay so on
 

2925
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:03,450
albeit exponentially slower okay so on
and computers don't go into some magical

2926
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:03,460
and computers don't go into some magical
 

2927
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:05,580
and computers don't go into some magical
place outside of Alan Turing's a

00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:05,590
place outside of Alan Turing's a

00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:10,150
do not solve the halting problem they
 

2933
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:11,760
do not solve the halting problem they
cannot solve anything that is

cannot solve anything that is
uncomputable in Alan Turing sense what

00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:14,650
uncomputable in Alan Turing sense what
 

2937
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:16,620
uncomputable in Alan Turing sense what
they what we think they do change is

2938
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:16,630
they what we think they do change is
 

2939
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:19,500
they what we think they do change is
what is efficiently computable okay and

2940
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:19,510
what is efficiently computable okay and
 

2941
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:22,500
what is efficiently computable okay and
you know since the 1960s you know the

2942
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:22,510
you know since the 1960s you know the
 

2943
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:24,480
you know since the 1960s you know the
word efficiently you know as well as

00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:24,490
word efficiently you know as well as
 

2945
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:26,370
word efficiently you know as well as
been a central word in computer science

2946
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:26,380
been a central word in computer science
 

2947
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:28,260
been a central word in computer science
but it's sort of a code word for

2948
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:28,270
but it's sort of a code word for
 

2949
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:31,170
but it's sort of a code word for
something technical which is basically

2950
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:31,180
something technical which is basically
 

2951
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:34,230
something technical which is basically
with polynomial scaling you know that as

2952
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:34,240
with polynomial scaling you know that as
 

2953
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,930
with polynomial scaling you know that as
you get to larger and larger inputs you

2954
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:36,940
you get to larger and larger inputs you
 

2955
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,970
you get to larger and larger inputs you
would like an algorithm that uses an

2956
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:38,980
would like an algorithm that uses an
 

2957
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:41,099
would like an algorithm that uses an
amount of time that scales only like the

2958
00:59:41,099 --> 00:59:41,109
amount of time that scales only like the
 

2959
00:59:41,109 --> 00:59:43,080
amount of time that scales only like the
size of the input raised to some power

2960
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:43,090
size of the input raised to some power
 

2961
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:45,870
size of the input raised to some power
and not exponentially with the size of

2962
00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:45,880
and not exponentially with the size of
 

2963
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:48,840
and not exponentially with the size of
the input right yeah so I I do hope we

2964
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:48,850
the input right yeah so I I do hope we
 

2965
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:51,540
the input right yeah so I I do hope we
get to talk again because one of the

2966
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:51,550
get to talk again because one of the
 

2967
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:53,370
get to talk again because one of the
many topics that there's probably

2968
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:53,380
many topics that there's probably
 

2969
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:54,800
many topics that there's probably
several hours with a competent

2970
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:54,810
several hours with a competent
 

2971
00:59:54,810 --> 00:59:56,910
several hours with a competent
conversation on is complexity which

2972
00:59:56,910 --> 00:59:56,920
conversation on is complexity which
 

2973
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,500
conversation on is complexity which
probably won't even get a chance to

2974
00:59:58,500 --> 00:59:58,510
probably won't even get a chance to
 

2975
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:02,130
probably won't even get a chance to
touch today but you briefly mentioned it

2976
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:02,140
touch today but you briefly mentioned it
 

2977
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:05,490
touch today but you briefly mentioned it
but let's let's maybe try to continue so

2978
01:00:05,490 --> 01:00:05,500
but let's let's maybe try to continue so
 

2979
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,770
but let's let's maybe try to continue so
you said the definition of quano

2980
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:07,780
you said the definition of quano
 

2981
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:10,849
you said the definition of quano
supremacy is basically design is

2982
01:00:10,849 --> 01:00:10,859
supremacy is basically design is
 

2983
01:00:10,859 --> 01:00:13,740
supremacy is basically design is
achieving a place where much faster on a

yes it's not that is or isn't useful
yeah yeah yeah right right and and I

2992
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:22,840
yeah yeah yeah right right and and I
 

2993
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,540
yeah yeah yeah right right and and I
would say that we really want three

2994
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:24,550
would say that we really want three
 

2995
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:27,090
would say that we really want three
things right we want first of all the

2996
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:27,100
things right we want first of all the
 

2997
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,490
things right we want first of all the
quantum computer to be much faster just

2998
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:29,500
quantum computer to be much faster just
 

2999
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,410
quantum computer to be much faster just
in the literal sense so like number of

3000
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:31,420
in the literal sense so like number of
 

3001
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:34,470
in the literal sense so like number of
seconds you know it's a solving this you

3002
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:34,480
seconds you know it's a solving this you
 

3003
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,570
seconds you know it's a solving this you
know well-defined you know problem

3004
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:36,580
know well-defined you know problem
 

3005
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:40,320
know well-defined you know problem
secondly we want it to be sort of a you

3006
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:40,330
secondly we want it to be sort of a you
 

3007
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:42,330
secondly we want it to be sort of a you
know for a problem where we really

3008
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:42,340
know for a problem where we really
 

3009
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:42,960
know for a problem where we really
believe

3010
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:42,970
believe
 

3011
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:44,880
believe
a quantum computer has better scaling

3012
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:44,890
a quantum computer has better scaling
 

3013
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:47,220
a quantum computer has better scaling
behavior right so it's not just an

3014
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:47,230
behavior right so it's not just an
 

3015
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:49,770
behavior right so it's not just an
incidental you know matter of hardware

3016
01:00:49,770 --> 01:00:49,780
incidental you know matter of hardware
 

3017
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:52,080
incidental you know matter of hardware
but it's that you know as you went to

3018
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:52,090
but it's that you know as you went to
 

3019
01:00:52,090 --> 01:00:54,450
but it's that you know as you went to
larger and larger inputs you know the

3020
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:54,460
larger and larger inputs you know the
 

3021
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:56,970
larger and larger inputs you know the
classical scaling would be exponential

3022
01:00:56,970 --> 01:00:56,980
classical scaling would be exponential
 

3023
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:59,250
classical scaling would be exponential
and the scaling for the quantum

3024
01:00:59,250 --> 01:00:59,260
and the scaling for the quantum
 

3025
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:01,320
and the scaling for the quantum
algorithm would only be polynomial and

3026
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:01,330
algorithm would only be polynomial and
 

3027
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:04,290
algorithm would only be polynomial and
then thirdly we want the first thing the

3028
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:04,300
then thirdly we want the first thing the
 

3029
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:07,140
then thirdly we want the first thing the
actual observed speed-up to only be

3030
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:07,150
actual observed speed-up to only be
 

3031
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:09,120
actual observed speed-up to only be
explainable in terms of the scaling

3032
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:09,130
explainable in terms of the scaling
 

3033
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:12,330
explainable in terms of the scaling
behavior right so you know I want I want

3034
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:12,340
behavior right so you know I want I want
 

3035
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:14,430
behavior right so you know I want I want
you know a real world you know a real

3036
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:14,440
you know a real world you know a real
 

3037
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,220
you know a real world you know a real
problem to get solved let's say by a

3038
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:17,230
problem to get solved let's say by a
 

3039
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:20,400
problem to get solved let's say by a
quantum computer with 50 cubits or so

3040
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:20,410
quantum computer with 50 cubits or so
 

3041
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:22,500
quantum computer with 50 cubits or so
and for no one to be able to explain

3042
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:22,510
and for no one to be able to explain
 

3043
01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:25,410
and for no one to be able to explain
that in any way other than well you know

3044
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:25,420
that in any way other than well you know
 

3045
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:29,340
that in any way other than well you know
the to the this this computer involved a

3046
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:29,350
the to the this this computer involved a
 

3047
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:31,800
the to the this this computer involved a
quantum state with 2 to the 50th power

3048
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:31,810
quantum state with 2 to the 50th power
 

3049
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:34,380
quantum state with 2 to the 50th power
amplitudes and you have a classical

3050
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:34,390
amplitudes and you have a classical
 

3051
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:36,270
amplitudes and you have a classical
simulation in at least any that we know

3052
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:36,280
simulation in at least any that we know
 

3053
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,970
simulation in at least any that we know
today would require keeping track of 2

3054
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:38,980
today would require keeping track of 2
 

3055
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:41,130
today would require keeping track of 2
to the 50th numbers and this is the

3056
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:41,140
to the 50th numbers and this is the
 

3057
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:42,840
to the 50th numbers and this is the
reason why it was faster so the

3058
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:42,850
reason why it was faster so the
 

3059
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:44,220
reason why it was faster so the
intuition is that then if you

3060
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:44,230
intuition is that then if you
 

3061
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:47,340
intuition is that then if you
demonstrate on 50 cubits then once you

3062
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:47,350
demonstrate on 50 cubits then once you
 

3063
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:49,080
demonstrate on 50 cubits then once you
get to 100 cubits then it'll be even

3064
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:49,090
get to 100 cubits then it'll be even
 

3065
01:01:49,090 --> 01:01:51,720
get to 100 cubits then it'll be even
much more faster precisely precisely

3066
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:51,730
much more faster precisely precisely
 

3067
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:53,910
much more faster precisely precisely
yeah and and you know and and and

3068
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:53,920
yeah and and you know and and and
 

3069
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,340
yeah and and you know and and and

you just want to prove that a quantum

3124
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:13,660
you just want to prove that a quantum
 

3125
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:15,750
you just want to prove that a quantum
computer is faster you know and not do

01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:15,760
computer is faster you know and not do
 

3127
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,000
computer is faster you know and not do
something useful with it then there are

3128
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:18,010
something useful with it then there are
 

3129
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:20,400
something useful with it then there are
huge advantages to sort of switching

3130
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:20,410
huge advantages to sort of switching
 

3131
01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:22,470
huge advantages to sort of switching

right answer to what we call sampling

3136
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:27,700
right answer to what we call sampling
 

3137
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:30,420
right answer to what we call sampling
problems so these are problems where the

3138
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:30,430
problems so these are problems where the
 

3139
01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:33,240
problems so these are problems where the
goal is just to output a sample from

01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:33,250
goal is just to output a sample from
 

3141
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:35,880
goal is just to output a sample from
some probability distribution let's say

3142
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:35,890
some probability distribution let's say
 

3143
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:38,490
some probability distribution let's say
over strings of 50 bits right so there

3144
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:38,500
over strings of 50 bits right so there
 

3145
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:41,010
over strings of 50 bits right so there
are you know many many many possible

3146
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:41,020
are you know many many many possible
 

3147
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:43,050
are you know many many many possible
valid outputs you know your computer

3148
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:43,060
valid outputs you know your computer
 

3149
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:44,790
valid outputs you know your computer
will probably never even produce the

3150
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:44,800
will probably never even produce the
 

3151
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,110
will probably never even produce the
same output twice

3152
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:46,120
same output twice
 

3153
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:50,490
same output twice
you know if it's running as even you

3154
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:50,500
you know if it's running as even you
 

3155
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,050
you know if it's running as even you
know assuming it's running perfectly

3156
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:52,060
know assuming it's running perfectly
 

3157
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:54,540
know assuming it's running perfectly
okay but but the key is that some

3158
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:54,550
okay but but the key is that some
 

3159
01:03:54,550 --> 01:03:56,460
okay but but the key is that some
outputs are supposed to be like clearer

3160
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:56,470
outputs are supposed to be like clearer
 

3161
01:03:56,470 --> 01:04:01,050
outputs are supposed to be like clearer
than other ones so sorry to clarify is

3162
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:01,060
than other ones so sorry to clarify is
 

3163
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:02,640
than other ones so sorry to clarify is
there a set of outputs that are valid

3164
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:02,650
there a set of outputs that are valid
 

3165
01:04:02,650 --> 01:04:04,980
there a set of outputs that are valid
and said they're not or is it more that

3166
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:04,990
and said they're not or is it more that
 

3167
01:04:04,990 --> 01:04:10,020
and said they're not or is it more that
the distribution of a particular kind of

3168
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:10,030
the distribution of a particular kind of
 

3169
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:12,810
the distribution of a particular kind of
output is more is the specific

3170
01:04:12,810 --> 01:04:12,820
output is more is the specific
 

3171
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:14,370
output is more is the specific
distribution yeah particular there's

3172
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:14,380
distribution yeah particular there's
 

3173
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:16,200
distribution yeah particular there's
there's there's a specific distribution

3174
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:16,210
there's there's a specific distribution
 

3175
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:18,300
there's there's a specific distribution
that you're trying to hit right or you

3176
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:18,310
that you're trying to hit right or you
 

3177
01:04:18,310 --> 01:04:19,680
that you're trying to hit right or you
know that you're trying to sample from

3178
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:19,690
know that you're trying to sample from
 

3179
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:22,200
know that you're trying to sample from
now there are a lot of questions about

3180
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:22,210
now there are a lot of questions about
 

3181
01:04:22,210 --> 01:04:24,420
now there are a lot of questions about
this you know how do you do that right

3182
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:24,430
this you know how do you do that right
 

3183
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:25,050
this you know how do you do that right
now

3184
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:25,060
now
 

3185
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:27,930
now
now how you how you do it you know it

3186
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:27,940
now how you how you do it you know it
 

3187
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:29,790
now how you how you do it you know it
turns out that with a quantum computer

3188
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:29,800
turns out that with a quantum computer
 

3189
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,250
turns out that with a quantum computer
even with the noisy quantum computers

3190
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:32,260
even with the noisy quantum computers
 

3191
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:35,100
even with the noisy quantum computers
that we have now that we have today what

3192
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:35,110
that we have now that we have today what
 

3193
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:36,960
that we have now that we have today what
you can do is basically just apply a

3194
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:36,970
you can do is basically just apply a
 

3195
01:04:36,970 --> 01:04:39,600
you can do is basically just apply a
randomly chosen sequence of operations

3196
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:39,610
randomly chosen sequence of operations
 

3197
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:41,910
randomly chosen sequence of operations
all right so we you know we in sometimes

3198
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:41,920
all right so we you know we in sometimes
 

3199
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,380
all right so we you know we in sometimes
you know we you know that part is almost

3200
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:43,390
you know we you know that part is almost
 

3201
01:04:43,390 --> 01:04:46,140
you know we you know that part is almost
trivial right we just sort of get the

3202
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:46,150
trivial right we just sort of get the
 

3203
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:48,450
trivial right we just sort of get the
qubits to interact in some random way

3204
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:48,460
qubits to interact in some random way
 

3205
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:50,970
qubits to interact in some random way
although a sort of precisely specified

3206
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:50,980
although a sort of precisely specified
 

3207
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:53,460
although a sort of precisely specified
random way so we can repeat the exact

3208
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:53,470
random way so we can repeat the exact
 

3209
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:55,830
random way so we can repeat the exact
same random sequence of interactions

3210
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:55,840
same random sequence of interactions
 

3211
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,990
same random sequence of interactions
again and get another sample from that

3212
01:04:57,990 --> 01:04:58,000
again and get another sample from that
 

3213
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,170
again and get another sample from that
same distribution and what this does is

3214
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:01,180
same distribution and what this does is
 

3215
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:03,330
same distribution and what this does is
it basically well it creates a lot of

3216
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:03,340
it basically well it creates a lot of
 

3217
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:05,400
it basically well it creates a lot of
garbage but you know very specific

3218
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:05,410
garbage but you know very specific
 

3219
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:09,329
garbage but you know very specific
garbage right so you know of all of the

3220
01:05:09,329 --> 01:05:09,339
garbage right so you know of all of the
 

3221
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:11,069
garbage right so you know of all of the
so if we're gonna talk about Google's

3222
01:05:11,069 --> 01:05:11,079
so if we're gonna talk about Google's
 

3223
01:05:11,079 --> 01:05:13,709
so if we're gonna talk about Google's
device there were 53 qubits there okay

3224
01:05:13,709 --> 01:05:13,719
device there were 53 qubits there okay
 

3225
01:05:13,719 --> 01:05:16,410
device there were 53 qubits there okay
and so there are two to the 53 power

3226
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:16,420
and so there are two to the 53 power
 

3227
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:19,079
and so there are two to the 53 power
possible outputs now for some of those

3228
01:05:19,079 --> 01:05:19,089
possible outputs now for some of those
 

3229
01:05:19,089 --> 01:05:21,749
possible outputs now for some of those
outputs you know there are there was a

3230
01:05:21,749 --> 01:05:21,759
outputs you know there are there was a
 

3231
01:05:21,759 --> 01:05:24,180
outputs you know there are there was a
little bit more destructive interference

3232
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:24,190
little bit more destructive interference
 

3233
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:26,069
little bit more destructive interference
in their amplitude okay so their

3234
01:05:26,069 --> 01:05:26,079
in their amplitude okay so their
 

3235
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:27,900
in their amplitude okay so their
amplitudes were a little bit smaller and

3236
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:27,910
amplitudes were a little bit smaller and
 

3237
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:29,519
amplitudes were a little bit smaller and
for others there was a little more

3238
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:29,529
for others there was a little more
 

3239
01:05:29,529 --> 01:05:31,200
for others there was a little more
constructive interference

3240
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:31,210
constructive interference
 

3241
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:32,729
constructive interference
you know the amplitudes were a little

3242
01:05:32,729 --> 01:05:32,739
you know the amplitudes were a little
 

3243
01:05:32,739 --> 01:05:34,799
you know the amplitudes were a little
bit more aligned with each other you

3244
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:34,809
bit more aligned with each other you
 

3245
01:05:34,809 --> 01:05:37,079
bit more aligned with each other you
know that and so those those that were a

3246
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:37,089
know that and so those those that were a
 

3247
01:05:37,089 --> 01:05:39,450
know that and so those those that were a
little bit likelier okay all of the

3248
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:39,460
little bit likelier okay all of the
 

3249
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:42,479
little bit likelier okay all of the
outputs are exponentially unlikely but

3250
01:05:42,479 --> 01:05:42,489
outputs are exponentially unlikely but
 

3251
01:05:42,489 --> 01:05:44,400
outputs are exponentially unlikely but
some are let's say two times or three

3252
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:44,410
some are let's say two times or three
 

3253
01:05:44,410 --> 01:05:46,890
some are let's say two times or three
times you know unlikely er than others

3254
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:46,900
times you know unlikely er than others
 

3255
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:50,759
times you know unlikely er than others
okay and so so you can define you know

3256
01:05:50,759 --> 01:05:50,769
okay and so so you can define you know
 

3257
01:05:50,769 --> 01:05:53,160
okay and so so you can define you know
the sequence of operations that gives

3258
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:53,170
the sequence of operations that gives
 

3259
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:55,009
the sequence of operations that gives
rise to this probability distribution

3260
01:05:55,009 --> 01:05:55,019
rise to this probability distribution
 

3261
01:05:55,019 --> 01:05:59,039
rise to this probability distribution
okay now the next question would be well

3262
01:05:59,039 --> 01:05:59,049
okay now the next question would be well
 

3263
01:05:59,049 --> 01:06:00,329
okay now the next question would be well
how do you you know even if you're

3264
01:06:00,329 --> 01:06:00,339
how do you you know even if you're
 

3265
01:06:00,339 --> 01:06:02,279
how do you you know even if you're
sampling from and how do you verify that

3266
01:06:02,279 --> 01:06:02,289
sampling from and how do you verify that
 

3267
01:06:02,289 --> 01:06:03,599
sampling from and how do you verify that
right how do you exam how do you know

3268
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:03,609
right how do you exam how do you know
 

3269
01:06:03,609 --> 01:06:07,769
right how do you exam how do you know
and so my students and I and also the

3270
01:06:07,769 --> 01:06:07,779
and so my students and I and also the
 

3271
01:06:07,779 --> 01:06:09,930
and so my students and I and also the
people at Google we're doing the

3272
01:06:09,930 --> 01:06:09,940
people at Google we're doing the
 

3273
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:12,180
people at Google we're doing the
experiment came up with statistical

3274
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:12,190
experiment came up with statistical
 

3275
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:15,109
experiment came up with statistical
tests that you can apply to the outputs

3276
01:06:15,109 --> 01:06:15,119
tests that you can apply to the outputs
 

3277
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:20,940
tests that you can apply to the outputs
in order to try to verify you know what

3278
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:20,950
in order to try to verify you know what
 

3279
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:23,130
in order to try to verify you know what
is you know that that at least that some

3280
01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:23,140
is you know that that at least that some
 

3281
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:26,219
is you know that that at least that some
hard problem is being solved the the

3282
01:06:26,219 --> 01:06:26,229
hard problem is being solved the the
 

3283
01:06:26,229 --> 01:06:28,370
hard problem is being solved the the
test that Google ended up using was

3284
01:06:28,370 --> 01:06:28,380
test that Google ended up using was
 

3285
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:30,390
test that Google ended up using was
something that they called the linear

3286
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:30,400
something that they called the linear
 

3287
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,209
something that they called the linear
cross entropy benchmark okay and it's

3288
01:06:33,209 --> 01:06:33,219
cross entropy benchmark okay and it's
 

3289
01:06:33,219 --> 01:06:35,609
cross entropy benchmark okay and it's
basically you know so the the drawback

3290
01:06:35,609 --> 01:06:35,619
basically you know so the the drawback
 

3291
01:06:35,619 --> 01:06:38,400
basically you know so the the drawback
of this test is that it requires like it

3292
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:38,410
of this test is that it requires like it
 

3293
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:42,109
of this test is that it requires like it
requires you to do a two to the 53 time

3294
01:06:42,109 --> 01:06:42,119
requires you to do a two to the 53 time
 

3295
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:44,430
requires you to do a two to the 53 time
calculation with your classical computer

3296
01:06:44,430 --> 01:06:44,440
calculation with your classical computer
 

3297
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:47,309
calculation with your classical computer
okay so it's very expensive to do the

3298
01:06:47,309 --> 01:06:47,319
okay so it's very expensive to do the
 

3299
01:06:47,319 --> 01:06:49,680
okay so it's very expensive to do the
test on a classical computer the good

3300
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:49,690
test on a classical computer the good
 

3301
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:52,380
test on a classical computer the good
news I think of a numbers - it's about 9

3302
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:52,390
news I think of a numbers - it's about 9
 

3303

quadrillion ok doesn't help well well

3304
01:06:55,410 --> 01:06:55,420
quadrillion ok doesn't help well well
 

3305
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:57,900
quadrillion ok doesn't help well well
you know you want to be like scientific

3306
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:57,910
you know you want to be like scientific
 

3307
01:06:57,910 --> 01:07:00,599
you know you want to be like scientific
notation oh no what I mean is yeah it is

3308
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:00,609
notation oh no what I mean is yeah it is
 

3309
01:07:00,609 --> 01:07:03,150

it is it is impossible to run on us yes

3310
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:03,160
it is it is impossible to run on us yes
 

3311
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:05,489
it is it is impossible to run on us yes
so we will come back to that it is just

3312
01:07:05,489 --> 01:07:05,499
so we will come back to that it is just
 

3313
01:07:05,499 --> 01:07:08,099
so we will come back to that it is just
barely possible to run we think on the

3314
01:07:08,099 --> 01:07:08,109
barely possible to run we think on the

01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:30,430
how to verify the results okay so we
 

3331
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:32,490
how to verify the results okay so we
want you know a number of qubits that is

you know that point will be passed and
 

3361
01:08:03,369 --> 01:08:05,819
you know that point will be passed and
and then when you get to larger numbers

3362
01:08:05,819 --> 01:08:05,829
and then when you get to larger numbers
 

3363
01:08:05,829 --> 01:08:08,370
and then when you get to larger numbers
of qubits then you know these these

types of sampling experiments will no

3366
01:08:10,530 --> 01:08:10,540
types of sampling experiments will no
 

3367
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:12,690
types of sampling experiments will no
longer be so interesting because we

3368
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:12,700
longer be so interesting because we
 

3369
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:14,970
longer be so interesting because we
won't even be able to verify the results

3370
01:08:14,970 --> 01:08:14,980
won't even be able to verify the results
 

3371
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:16,860
won't even be able to verify the results
and we'll have to switch to other types

3372
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:16,870
and we'll have to switch to other types
 

3373
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:18,749
and we'll have to switch to other types
of computations so with it with the

3374
01:08:18,749 --> 01:08:18,759
of computations so with it with the
 

3375
01:08:18,759 --> 01:08:20,910
of computations so with it with the
sampling thing you know so so the test

3376
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:20,920
sampling thing you know so so the test
 

3377
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:23,340
sampling thing you know so so the test
that Google applied with this linear

01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:23,350
that Google applied with this linear
 

3379
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:25,110
that Google applied with this linear
cross entropy benchmark would basically

3380
01:08:25,110 --> 01:08:25,120
cross entropy benchmark would basically
 

3381
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,390
cross entropy benchmark would basically
just take the samples that were

3382
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:27,400
just take the samples that were
 

3383
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,849
just take the samples that were
generated which are you know a very

3384
01:08:29,849 --> 01:08:29,859
generated which are you know a very
 

3385
01:08:29,859 --> 01:08:32,309
generated which are you know a very
small subset of all the possible samples

3386
01:08:32,309 --> 01:08:32,319
small subset of all the possible samples
 

3387
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:34,019
small subset of all the possible samples
that there are but for those you

3388
01:08:34,019 --> 01:08:34,029
that there are but for those you
 

3389
01:08:34,029 --> 01:08:36,450
that there are but for those you
calculate with your classical computer

3390
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:36,460
calculate with your classical computer
 

3391
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:38,370
calculate with your classical computer
the probabilities that they should have

3392
01:08:38,370 --> 01:08:38,380
the probabilities that they should have
 

3393
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:40,740
the probabilities that they should have
been output and you see are those

3394
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:40,750
been output and you see are those
 

3395
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:42,749
been output and you see are those
probabilities like larger than the mean

3396
01:08:42,749 --> 01:08:42,759
probabilities like larger than the mean
 

3397
01:08:42,759 --> 01:08:45,269
probabilities like larger than the mean
you know so is the quantum computer bias

3398
01:08:45,269 --> 01:08:45,279
you know so is the quantum computer bias
 

3399
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:47,490
you know so is the quantum computer bias
toward outputting the strings that it's

3400
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:47,500
toward outputting the strings that it's
 

3401
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:49,530
toward outputting the strings that it's
you know that you want it to be biased

3402
01:08:49,530 --> 01:08:49,540
you know that you want it to be biased
 

3403
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:52,559
you know that you want it to be biased
toward okay and then finally we come to

3404
01:08:52,559 --> 01:08:52,569
toward okay and then finally we come to
 

3405
01:08:52,569 --> 01:08:54,690
toward okay and then finally we come to
a very crucial question which is

3406
01:08:54,690 --> 01:08:54,700
a very crucial question which is
 

3407
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:56,700
a very crucial question which is
supposing that it does that well how do

3408
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:56,710
supposing that it does that well how do
 

3409
01:08:56,710 --> 01:08:58,709
supposing that it does that well how do
we know that a classical computer could

3410
01:08:58,709 --> 01:08:58,719
we know that a classical computer could
 

3411
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:00,360
we know that a classical computer could
not have quickly done the same thing

3412
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:00,370
not have quickly done the same thing
 

3413
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:02,640
not have quickly done the same thing
right how do we know that you know this

3414
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:02,650
right how do we know that you know this
 

3415
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:03,930
right how do we know that you know this
couldn't have been spoofed by a

3416
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:03,940
couldn't have been spoofed by a
 

3417
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:07,289
couldn't have been spoofed by a
classical computer right and so well the

3418
01:09:07,289 --> 01:09:07,299
classical computer right and so well the
 

3419
01:09:07,299 --> 01:09:09,180
classical computer right and so well the
first answer is we don't know for sure

3420
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:09,190
first answer is we don't know for sure
 

3421
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:11,459
first answer is we don't know for sure
because you know this takes us into

3422
01:09:11,459 --> 01:09:11,469
because you know this takes us into
 

3423
01:09:11,469 --> 01:09:14,070
because you know this takes us into
questions of complexity theory you know

3424
01:09:14,070 --> 01:09:14,080
questions of complexity theory you know
 

3425
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,530
questions of complexity theory you know
you know the I mean questions on the of

3426
01:09:16,530 --> 01:09:16,540
you know the I mean questions on the of
 

3427
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:18,780
you know the I mean questions on the of
the magnitude of the P versus NP

3428
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:18,790
the magnitude of the P versus NP
 

3429
01:09:18,790 --> 01:09:20,640
the magnitude of the P versus NP
question and think that right we you

3430
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:20,650
question and think that right we you
 

3431
01:09:20,650 --> 01:09:22,099
question and think that right we you
know we don't know how to rule out

3432
01:09:22,099 --> 01:09:22,109
know we don't know how to rule out
 

3433
01:09:22,109 --> 01:09:24,650
know we don't know how to rule out
definitively that there could be fast

3434
01:09:24,650 --> 01:09:24,660
definitively that there could be fast
 

3435
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:27,329
definitively that there could be fast
classical algorithms for you know even

3436
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:27,339
classical algorithms for you know even
 

3437
01:09:27,339 --> 01:09:30,209
classical algorithms for you know even
simulating quantum mechanics and for you

3438
01:09:30,209 --> 01:09:30,219
simulating quantum mechanics and for you
 

3439
01:09:30,219 --> 01:09:31,979
simulating quantum mechanics and for you
know simulating experiments like these

3440
01:09:31,979 --> 01:09:31,989
know simulating experiments like these
 

3441
01:09:31,989 --> 01:09:34,920
know simulating experiments like these
but we can give some evidence against

3442
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:34,930
but we can give some evidence against
 

3443
01:09:34,930 --> 01:09:36,719
but we can give some evidence against
that possibility and

3444
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:36,729
that possibility and
 

3445
01:09:36,729 --> 01:09:38,969
that possibility and
was sort of the you know the main thrust

3446
01:09:38,969 --> 01:09:38,979
was sort of the you know the main thrust
 

3447
01:09:38,979 --> 01:09:40,949
was sort of the you know the main thrust
of a lot of the work that my colleagues

3448
01:09:40,949 --> 01:09:40,959
of a lot of the work that my colleagues
 

3449
01:09:40,959 --> 01:09:43,680
of a lot of the work that my colleagues
and I did you know over the last decade

3450
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:43,690
and I did you know over the last decade
 

3451
01:09:43,690 --> 01:09:46,589
and I did you know over the last decade
which is then sort of in around 2015 or

3452
01:09:46,589 --> 01:09:46,599
which is then sort of in around 2015 or
 

3453
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:48,959
which is then sort of in around 2015 or
so what led to Google deciding to do

3454
01:09:48,959 --> 01:09:48,969
so what led to Google deciding to do
 

3455
01:09:48,969 --> 01:09:51,359
so what led to Google deciding to do
this experiment so is the kind of

3456
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:51,369
this experiment so is the kind of
 

3457
01:09:51,369 --> 01:09:53,969
this experiment so is the kind of
evidence you first of all the hard P

3458
01:09:53,969 --> 01:09:53,979
evidence you first of all the hard P
 

3459
01:09:53,979 --> 01:09:56,069
evidence you first of all the hard P
equals NP problem that you mentioned and

3460
01:09:56,069 --> 01:09:56,079
equals NP problem that you mentioned and
 

3461
01:09:56,079 --> 01:09:59,489
equals NP problem that you mentioned and
the kind of evidence the year were

3462
01:09:59,489 --> 01:09:59,499
the kind of evidence the year were
 

3463
01:09:59,499 --> 01:10:02,370
the kind of evidence the year were
looking at is that something you come to

3464
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:02,380
looking at is that something you come to
 

3465
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:05,219
looking at is that something you come to
on a sheet of paper or is this something

3466
01:10:05,219 --> 01:10:05,229
on a sheet of paper or is this something
 

3467
01:10:05,229 --> 01:10:07,620
on a sheet of paper or is this something
are these empirical experiments it's

3468
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:07,630
are these empirical experiments it's
 

3469
01:10:07,630 --> 01:10:10,080
are these empirical experiments it's
it's math for the most part I mean it

3470
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:10,090
it's math for the most part I mean it
 

3471
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:12,719
it's math for the most part I mean it
you know it's also trot you know you

3472
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:12,729
you know it's also trot you know you
 

3473
01:10:12,729 --> 01:10:16,109
you know it's also trot you know you
know we have a bunch of methods that are

3474
01:10:16,109 --> 01:10:16,119
know we have a bunch of methods that are
 

3475
01:10:16,119 --> 01:10:20,250
know we have a bunch of methods that are
known for simulating quantum circuits or

3476
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:20,260
known for simulating quantum circuits or
 

3477
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:22,109
known for simulating quantum circuits or
you know quantum computations with

3478
01:10:22,109 --> 01:10:22,119
you know quantum computations with
 

3479
01:10:22,119 --> 01:10:24,390
you know quantum computations with
classical computers and so we have to

3480
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:24,400
classical computers and so we have to
 

3481
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,580
classical computers and so we have to
try them all out and make sure that you

3482
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:26,590
try them all out and make sure that you
 

3483
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:28,560
try them all out and make sure that you
know they don't work you know make sure

3484
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:28,570
know they don't work you know make sure
 

3485
01:10:28,570 --> 01:10:31,020
know they don't work you know make sure
that they have exponential scaling on on

3486
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:31,030
that they have exponential scaling on on
 

3487
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:33,239
that they have exponential scaling on on
you know these problems and and not just

3488
01:10:33,239 --> 01:10:33,249
you know these problems and and not just
 

3489
01:10:33,249 --> 01:10:35,459
you know these problems and and not just
theoretically but with the actual range

3490
01:10:35,459 --> 01:10:35,469
theoretically but with the actual range
 

3491
01:10:35,469 --> 01:10:38,120
theoretically but with the actual range
of parameters that are actually you know

3492
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:38,130
of parameters that are actually you know
 

3493
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:40,680
of parameters that are actually you know
arising in Google's experiment okay so

3494
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:40,690
arising in Google's experiment okay so
 

3495
01:10:40,690 --> 01:10:43,020
arising in Google's experiment okay so
so there is an empirical component to it

3496
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:43,030
so there is an empirical component to it
 

3497
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:46,680
so there is an empirical component to it
right but now on on the theoretical side

3498
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:46,690
right but now on on the theoretical side
 

3499
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:48,959
right but now on on the theoretical side
you know what basically what we know how

3500
01:10:48,959 --> 01:10:48,969
you know what basically what we know how
 

3501
01:10:48,969 --> 01:10:51,600
you know what basically what we know how
to do in theoretical computer science

3502
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:51,610
to do in theoretical computer science
 

3503
01:10:51,610 --> 01:10:54,209
to do in theoretical computer science
and computational complexity is you know

3504
01:10:54,209 --> 01:10:54,219
and computational complexity is you know
 

3505
01:10:54,219 --> 01:10:56,729
and computational complexity is you know
we don't know how to prove that most of

3506
01:10:56,729 --> 01:10:56,739
we don't know how to prove that most of
 

3507
01:10:56,739 --> 01:10:59,040
we don't know how to prove that most of
the problems we care about are hard but

3508
01:10:59,040 --> 01:10:59,050
the problems we care about are hard but
 

3509
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:01,080
the problems we care about are hard but
we know how to pass the blame to someone

3510
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:01,090
we know how to pass the blame to someone
 

3511
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,209
we know how to pass the blame to someone
else yeah we know how to say well look

3512
01:11:03,209 --> 01:11:03,219
else yeah we know how to say well look
 

3513
01:11:03,219 --> 01:11:05,580
else yeah we know how to say well look
you know I can't prove that this problem

3514
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:05,590
you know I can't prove that this problem
 

3515
01:11:05,590 --> 01:11:08,100
you know I can't prove that this problem
is hard but if it is easy then all these

3516
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:08,110
is hard but if it is easy then all these
 

3517
01:11:08,110 --> 01:11:10,140
is hard but if it is easy then all these
other things that you know if you know

3518
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:10,150
other things that you know if you know
 

3519
01:11:10,150 --> 01:11:12,509
other things that you know if you know
first you you probably we're much more

3520
01:11:12,509 --> 01:11:12,519
first you you probably we're much more
 

3521
01:11:12,519 --> 01:11:14,549
first you you probably we're much more
confident or we're hard that then those

3522
01:11:14,549 --> 01:11:14,559
confident or we're hard that then those
 

3523
01:11:14,559 --> 01:11:17,759
confident or we're hard that then those
would be easily as well okay so so we

3524
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:17,769
would be easily as well okay so so we
 

3525
01:11:17,769 --> 01:11:19,979
would be easily as well okay so so we
can give what are called reductions this

3526
01:11:19,979 --> 01:11:19,989
can give what are called reductions this
 

3527
01:11:19,989 --> 01:11:22,620
can give what are called reductions this
has been the basic strategy in you know

3528
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:22,630
has been the basic strategy in you know
 

3529
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:25,589
has been the basic strategy in you know
an NP completeness right in all of

3530
01:11:25,589 --> 01:11:25,599
an NP completeness right in all of
 

3531
01:11:25,599 --> 01:11:27,660
an NP completeness right in all of
theoretical computer science and

3532
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:27,670
theoretical computer science and
 

3533
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:30,810
theoretical computer science and
cryptography since the 1970s really and

3534
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:30,820
cryptography since the 1970s really and
 

3535
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:33,359
cryptography since the 1970s really and
so we were able to give some reduction

3536
01:11:33,359 --> 01:11:33,369
so we were able to give some reduction
 

3537
01:11:33,369 --> 01:11:37,080
so we were able to give some reduction
evidence for the hardness of simulating

3538
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:37,090
evidence for the hardness of simulating
 

3539
01:11:37,090 --> 01:11:40,379
evidence for the hardness of simulating
these sampling experiments these

3540
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:40,389
these sampling experiments these
 

3541
01:11:40,389 --> 01:11:42,270
these sampling experiments these
sampling based quantum supremacy

3542
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:42,280
sampling based quantum supremacy
 

3543
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:44,580
sampling based quantum supremacy
experiments the reduction evidence is

3544
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:44,590
experiments the reduction evidence is
 

3545
01:11:44,590 --> 01:11:47,549
experiments the reduction evidence is
not as satisfactory as it should be one

3546
01:11:47,549 --> 01:11:47,559
not as satisfactory as it should be one
 

3547
01:11:47,559 --> 01:11:49,469
not as satisfactory as it should be one
of the biggest open problems in this

3548
01:11:49,469 --> 01:11:49,479
of the biggest open problems in this
 

3549
01:11:49,479 --> 01:11:50,400
of the biggest open problems in this
area is to

3550
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:50,410
area is to
 

3551
01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:52,470
area is to
make it better but you know we can do

3552
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:52,480
make it better but you know we can do
 

3553
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:56,010
make it better but you know we can do
something you know certainly we can you

3554
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:56,020
something you know certainly we can you
 

3555
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:57,870
something you know certainly we can you
say that you know if there is a fast

3556
01:11:57,870 --> 01:11:57,880
say that you know if there is a fast
 

3557
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:00,150
say that you know if there is a fast
classical algorithm to spoof these

3558
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:00,160
classical algorithm to spoof these
 

3559
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:02,520
classical algorithm to spoof these
experiments then it has to be very very

3560
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:02,530
experiments then it has to be very very
 

3561
01:12:02,530 --> 01:12:04,410
experiments then it has to be very very
unlike any of the algorithms that we

3562
01:12:04,410 --> 01:12:04,420
unlike any of the algorithms that we
 

3563
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:09,060
unlike any of the algorithms that we
know which is kind of in the same kind

3564
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:09,070
know which is kind of in the same kind
 

3565
01:12:09,070 --> 01:12:11,250
know which is kind of in the same kind
of space of reasoning that people say P

equal not equals NP yeah it's in the

3568
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:14,590
equal not equals NP yeah it's in the
 

3569
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:17,070

01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:21,300
Peter shor you know 26 years ago that
really started quantum computing you

3612
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:21,310
really started quantum computing you
 

3613
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:24,540
really started quantum computing you
know as an autonomous field was that if

3614
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:24,550
know as an autonomous field was that if
 

3615
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:27,030
know as an autonomous field was that if
you build a full scalable quantum

3616
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:27,040
you build a full scalable quantum
 

3617
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:29,910
you build a full scalable quantum
computer then you could use it to

3618
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:29,920
computer then you could use it to
 

3619
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:33,260
computer then you could use it to
efficiently find the prime factors of

3620
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:33,270
efficiently find the prime factors of
 

3621
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:36,930
efficiently find the prime factors of
huge numbers and calculate discrete

3622
01:13:36,930 --> 01:13:36,940
huge numbers and calculate discrete
 

3623
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:39,510
huge numbers and calculate discrete
logarithms and solve a few other

3624
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:39,520
logarithms and solve a few other
 

3625
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:42,030
logarithms and solve a few other
problems that are very very special and

3626
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:42,040
problems that are very very special and
 

3627
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,160
problems that are very very special and
character right they're not np-complete

3628
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:44,170
character right they're not np-complete
 

3629
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:45,870
character right they're not np-complete
problems we're pretty sure they're not

3630
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:45,880
problems we're pretty sure they're not
 

3631
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:50,490
problems we're pretty sure they're not
okay but it so happens that most of the

3632
01:13:50,490 --> 01:13:50,500
okay but it so happens that most of the
 

3633
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:52,410
okay but it so happens that most of the
public key cryptography that we

3634
01:13:52,410 --> 01:13:52,420
public key cryptography that we
 

3635
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:54,540
public key cryptography that we
currently use to protect the internet is

3636
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:54,550
currently use to protect the internet is
 

3637
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:56,970
currently use to protect the internet is
based on the belief that these problems

3638
01:13:56,970 --> 01:13:56,980
based on the belief that these problems
 

3639
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:58,920
based on the belief that these problems
are hard okay what sure showed is that

3640
01:13:58,920 --> 01:13:58,930
are hard okay what sure showed is that
 

3641
01:13:58,930 --> 01:14:01,290
are hard okay what sure showed is that
once you get scalable quantum computers

3642
01:14:01,290 --> 01:14:01,300
once you get scalable quantum computers
 

3643
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:03,810
once you get scalable quantum computers
then that's no longer true okay but now

3644
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:03,820
then that's no longer true okay but now
 

3645
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:06,930
then that's no longer true okay but now
you know uh you know before people panic

3646
01:14:06,930 --> 01:14:06,940
you know uh you know before people panic
 

3647
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:08,760
you know uh you know before people panic
there are two important points to

3648
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:08,770
there are two important points to
 

3649
01:14:08,770 --> 01:14:11,390
there are two important points to
understand here okay the first is that

3650
01:14:11,390 --> 01:14:11,400
understand here okay the first is that
 

3651
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:14,339
understand here okay the first is that
quantum supremacy the milestone that

3652
01:14:14,339 --> 01:14:14,349
quantum supremacy the milestone that
 

3653
01:14:14,349 --> 01:14:17,069
quantum supremacy the milestone that
Google just achieved is very very far

3654
01:14:17,069 --> 01:14:17,079
Google just achieved is very very far
 

3655
01:14:17,079 --> 01:14:18,990
Google just achieved is very very far
from the kind of scalable quantum

3656
01:14:18,990 --> 01:14:19,000
from the kind of scalable quantum
 

3657
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,790
from the kind of scalable quantum
computer that would be needed to

3658
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:20,800
computer that would be needed to
 

3659
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,500
computer that would be needed to
actually threaten public key

3660
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:22,510
actually threaten public key
 

3661
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:24,540
actually threaten public key
cryptography okay so you know we touched

3662
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:24,550
cryptography okay so you know we touched
 

3663
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:26,669
cryptography okay so you know we touched
on this earlier bright but Google's

3664
01:14:26,669 --> 01:14:26,679
on this earlier bright but Google's
 

3665
01:14:26,679 --> 01:14:30,000
on this earlier bright but Google's
device has 53 physical qubits right you

3666
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:30,010
device has 53 physical qubits right you
 

3667
01:14:30,010 --> 01:14:32,879
device has 53 physical qubits right you
threaten cryptography you're talking you

3668
01:14:32,879 --> 01:14:32,889
threaten cryptography you're talking you
 

3669
01:14:32,889 --> 01:14:34,169
threaten cryptography you're talking you
know with any of the known error

3670
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:34,179
know with any of the known error
 

3671
01:14:34,179 --> 01:14:35,580
know with any of the known error
correction method you're talking

3672
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:35,590
correction method you're talking
 

3673
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:37,680
correction method you're talking
millions of physical qubits because

3674
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:37,690
millions of physical qubits because
 

3675
01:14:37,690 --> 01:14:40,229
millions of physical qubits because
error correction would be required yes

3676
01:14:40,229 --> 01:14:40,239
error correction would be required yes
 

3677
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:45,270
error correction would be required yes
yes yes yeah yes yeah it's a it

3678
01:14:45,270 --> 01:14:45,280
yes yes yeah yes yeah it's a it
 

3679
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:48,450
yes yes yeah yes yeah it's a it
certainly would right and uh you know

3680
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:48,460
certainly would right and uh you know
 

3681
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:51,959
certainly would right and uh you know
how much you know how great will the

3682
01:14:51,959 --> 01:14:51,969
how much you know how great will the
 

3683
01:14:51,969 --> 01:14:53,879
how much you know how great will the
overhead be from the error correction

3684
01:14:53,879 --> 01:14:53,889
overhead be from the error correction
 

3685
01:14:53,889 --> 01:14:56,129
overhead be from the error correction
that we don't know yet but with the

3686
01:14:56,129 --> 01:14:56,139
that we don't know yet but with the
 

3687
01:14:56,139 --> 01:14:59,069
that we don't know yet but with the
known codes you're talking millions of

3688
01:14:59,069 --> 01:14:59,079
known codes you're talking millions of
 

3689
01:14:59,079 --> 01:15:00,959
known codes you're talking millions of
physical qubits and of a much higher

3690
01:15:00,959 --> 01:15:00,969
physical qubits and of a much higher
 

3691
01:15:00,969 --> 01:15:03,240
physical qubits and of a much higher
quality than any that we have now okay

3692
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:03,250
quality than any that we have now okay
 

3693
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:06,359
quality than any that we have now okay
so you know I I don't I don't think that

3694
01:15:06,359 --> 01:15:06,369
so you know I I don't I don't think that
 

3695
01:15:06,369 --> 01:15:09,950
so you know I I don't I don't think that
that is you know coming soon although

3696
01:15:09,950 --> 01:15:09,960
that is you know coming soon although
 

3697
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:12,750
that is you know coming soon although
people who have secrets that you know

3698
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:12,760
people who have secrets that you know
 

3699
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:15,689
people who have secrets that you know
need to stay secret for 20 years you

3700
01:15:15,689 --> 01:15:15,699
need to stay secret for 20 years you
 

3701
01:15:15,699 --> 01:15:17,970
need to stay secret for 20 years you
know are already worried about this you

3702
01:15:17,970 --> 01:15:17,980
know are already worried about this you
 

3703
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:19,979
know are already worried about this you
know for the good reason that you know

3704
01:15:19,979 --> 01:15:19,989
know for the good reason that you know
 

3705
01:15:19,989 --> 01:15:22,260
know for the good reason that you know
we presume that intelligence agencies

3706
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:22,270
we presume that intelligence agencies
 

3707
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:25,439
we presume that intelligence agencies
are already scooping up data you know in

3708
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:25,449
are already scooping up data you know in
 

3709
01:15:25,449 --> 01:15:27,300
are already scooping up data you know in
the hope that eventually they'll be able

3710
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:27,310
the hope that eventually they'll be able
 

3711
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:29,069
the hope that eventually they'll be able
to decode it once quantum computers

3712
01:15:29,069 --> 01:15:29,079
to decode it once quantum computers
 

3713
01:15:29,079 --> 01:15:31,830
to decode it once quantum computers
become available okay so so there is so

3714
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:31,840
become available okay so so there is so
 

3715
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,830
become available okay so so there is so
so so so this brings me to the second

3716
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:33,840
so so so this brings me to the second
 

3717
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,149
so so so this brings me to the second
point I wanted to make which is that

3718
01:15:36,149 --> 01:15:36,159
point I wanted to make which is that
 

3719
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:39,270
point I wanted to make which is that
there are other public key cryptosystems

3720
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:39,280
there are other public key cryptosystems
 

3721
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:42,870
there are other public key cryptosystems
that are known that we don't know how to

3722
01:15:42,870 --> 01:15:42,880
that are known that we don't know how to
 

3723
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:45,240
that are known that we don't know how to
break even with quantum computers okay

3724
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:45,250
break even with quantum computers okay
 

3725
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:46,800
break even with quantum computers okay
and there so there's a whole field

3726
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:46,810
and there so there's a whole field
 

3727
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:49,470
and there so there's a whole field
devoted to this now which is called post

3728
01:15:49,470 --> 01:15:49,480
devoted to this now which is called post
 

3729
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:52,560
devoted to this now which is called post
quantum cryptography okay and so there

3730
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:52,570
quantum cryptography okay and so there
 

3731
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:54,600
quantum cryptography okay and so there
is already so so we have some good

3732
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:54,610
is already so so we have some good
 

3733
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:58,109
is already so so we have some good
candidates now the best-known being what

3734
01:15:58,109 --> 01:15:58,119
candidates now the best-known being what
 

3735
01:15:58,119 --> 01:16:00,240
candidates now the best-known being what
are called lattice based crypto systems

3736
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:00,250
are called lattice based crypto systems
 

3737
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:03,030
are called lattice based crypto systems
and there is already some push to try to

3738
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:03,040
and there is already some push to try to
 

3739
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:06,260
and there is already some push to try to
migrate to these crypto systems so NIST

3740
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:06,270
migrate to these crypto systems so NIST
 

3741
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:10,229
migrate to these crypto systems so NIST
in the u.s. is holding a competition to

3742
01:16:10,229 --> 01:16:10,239
in the u.s. is holding a competition to
 

3743
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:12,689
in the u.s. is holding a competition to
create standards for post quantum

3744
01:16:12,689 --> 01:16:12,699
create standards for post quantum
 

3745
01:16:12,699 --> 01:16:14,910
create standards for post quantum
cryptography which will be the first

3746
01:16:14,910 --> 01:16:14,920
cryptography which will be the first
 

3747
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:17,220
cryptography which will be the first
step in trying to get every

3748
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:17,230
step in trying to get every
 

3749
01:16:17,230 --> 01:16:20,100
step in trying to get every
web browser and every router to upgrade

3750
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:20,110
web browser and every router to upgrade
 

3751
01:16:20,110 --> 01:16:22,920
web browser and every router to upgrade
you know and use a you know some like

3752
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:22,930
you know and use a you know some like
 

3753
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:26,280
you know and use a you know some like
SSL that is would be based on on you

3754
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:26,290
SSL that is would be based on on you
 

3755
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:28,140
SSL that is would be based on on you
know what we think is quantum secure

3756
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:28,150
know what we think is quantum secure
 

3757
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:30,300
know what we think is quantum secure
cryptography but you know this will this

3758
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:30,310
cryptography but you know this will this
 

3759
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:34,080
cryptography but you know this will this
will be a long process but you know it

3760
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:34,090
will be a long process but you know it
 

3761
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,280
will be a long process but you know it
is it is something that people are

3762
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:35,290
is it is something that people are
 

3763
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:38,430
is it is something that people are
already starting to do and so so you

3764
01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:38,440
already starting to do and so so you
 

3765
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,980
already starting to do and so so you
know I'm sure as algorithm is was sort

3766
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:40,990

certainly if no one else knows that they
 

3777
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:56,730
certainly if no one else knows that they
have it right but eventually we think

3778
01:16:56,730 --> 01:16:56,740
have it right but eventually we think
 

3779
01:16:56,740 --> 01:16:58,650
have it right but eventually we think
that we could migrate the internet to

3780
01:16:58,650 --> 01:16:58,660
that we could migrate the internet to
 

3781
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:00,960
that we could migrate the internet to
the post quantum cryptography and we'd

01:17:00,970 --> 01:17:03,150

be more or less back where we started

be more or less back where we started
 

3785
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,980
be more or less back where we started
okay so this is sort of not the

01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:04,990
okay so this is sort of not the
 

3787
01:17:04,990 --> 01:17:07,620
okay so this is sort of not the

do something very yeah right but I think

3864

do something very yeah right but I think
 

3865
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:44,640
do something very yeah right but I think
you know within the next decade the best

over the next decade now I don't know if
they're gonna realize it or not but you

3921
01:19:44,290 --> 01:19:46,439
know it is you know there's there sir
they certainly at least have a shot so

01:19:46,439 --> 01:19:46,449
they certainly at least have a shot so
 

3923
01:19:46,449 --> 01:19:48,030
they certainly at least have a shot so
it's gonna be a very very interesting

3924
01:19:48,030 --> 01:19:48,040
it's gonna be a very very interesting
 

3925
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:50,490
it's gonna be a very very interesting
next decade justify what's your

3926
01:19:50,490 --> 01:19:50,500
next decade justify what's your
 

3927
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:53,189
next decade justify what's your
intuition is if a breakthrough like that

3928
01:19:53,189 --> 01:19:53,199
intuition is if a breakthrough like that
 

3929
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:54,959
intuition is if a breakthrough like that
comes would is it possible for that

3930
01:19:54,959 --> 01:19:54,969
comes would is it possible for that
 

3931
01:19:54,969 --> 01:19:57,780
comes would is it possible for that
breakthrough to beyond 50 to 100 cubits

3932
01:19:57,780 --> 01:19:57,790
breakthrough to beyond 50 to 100 cubits
 

3933
01:19:57,790 --> 01:20:02,160
breakthrough to beyond 50 to 100 cubits
or is scale a fundamental thing like 500

3934
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:02,170
or is scale a fundamental thing like 500
 

3935
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:05,879
or is scale a fundamental thing like 500
1000 of us qubits yeah so I I can tell

3936
01:20:05,879 --> 01:20:05,889
1000 of us qubits yeah so I I can tell
 

3937
01:20:05,889 --> 01:20:08,459
1000 of us qubits yeah so I I can tell
you what the current studies are saying

3938
01:20:08,459 --> 01:20:08,469
you what the current studies are saying
 

3939
01:20:08,469 --> 01:20:11,430
you what the current studies are saying
you know I I think probably better to

3940
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:11,440
you know I I think probably better to
 

3941
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:14,280
you know I I think probably better to
rely on that that my intuition but you

3942
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:14,290
rely on that that my intuition but you
 

3943
01:20:14,290 --> 01:20:16,410
rely on that that my intuition but you
know there there was a group at

3944
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:16,420
know there there was a group at
 

3945
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:19,799
know there there was a group at
Microsoft had a study a few years ago

3946
01:20:19,799 --> 01:20:19,809
Microsoft had a study a few years ago
 

3947
01:20:19,809 --> 01:20:22,830
Microsoft had a study a few years ago
that said even with only about 100

3948
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:22,840
that said even with only about 100
 

3949
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:25,200
that said even with only about 100
cubits you know you could already learn

3950
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:25,210
cubits you know you could already learn
 

3951
01:20:25,210 --> 01:20:28,290
cubits you know you could already learn
something new about this the chemical

3952
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:28,300
something new about this the chemical
 

3953
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:30,089
something new about this the chemical
reaction that makes fertilizer for

3954
01:20:30,089 --> 01:20:30,099
reaction that makes fertilizer for
 

3955
01:20:30,099 --> 01:20:32,250
reaction that makes fertilizer for
example the trouble is they're talking

3956
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:32,260
example the trouble is they're talking
 

3957
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:36,089
example the trouble is they're talking
about a hundred qubits and about a

3958
01:20:36,089 --> 01:20:36,099
about a hundred qubits and about a
 

3959
01:20:36,099 --> 01:20:39,180
about a hundred qubits and about a
million layers of quantum gates okay so

3960
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:39,190
million layers of quantum gates okay so
 

3961
01:20:39,190 --> 01:20:40,620
million layers of quantum gates okay so
there so basically they're talking about

3962
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:40,630
there so basically they're talking about
 

3963
01:20:40,630 --> 01:20:42,990
there so basically they're talking about
a hundred nearly perfect qubits

3964
01:20:42,990 --> 01:20:43,000
a hundred nearly perfect qubits
 

3965
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,730
a hundred nearly perfect qubits
so the logical qubits is you measure

3966
01:20:44,730 --> 01:20:44,740
so the logical qubits is you measure
 

3967
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:48,210
so the logical qubits is you measure
exactly a hundred logical qubits and and

3968
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:48,220
exactly a hundred logical qubits and and
 

3969
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:50,310
exactly a hundred logical qubits and and
now you know the hard part for the next

3970
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:50,320
now you know the hard part for the next
 

3971
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,050
now you know the hard part for the next
decade is going to be well what can we

3972
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:52,060
decade is going to be well what can we
 

3973
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:54,570
decade is going to be well what can we
do with a hundred to two hundred noisy

3974
01:20:54,570 --> 01:20:54,580
do with a hundred to two hundred noisy
 

3975
01:20:54,580 --> 01:20:57,060
do with a hundred to two hundred noisy
qubits yeah yeah

3976
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:57,070
qubits yeah yeah
 

3977
01:20:57,070 --> 01:20:58,320
qubits yeah yeah
is that an error correction

3978
01:20:58,320 --> 01:20:58,330
is that an error correction
 

3979
01:20:58,330 --> 01:20:59,910
is that an error correction
breakthroughs that might come without

3980
01:20:59,910 --> 01:20:59,920
breakthroughs that might come without
 

3981
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:03,330
breakthroughs that might come without
and need to do thousands or millions of

3982
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:03,340
and need to do thousands or millions of
 

3983
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:06,740
and need to do thousands or millions of
yeah yeah so people are gonna be pushing

3984
01:21:06,740 --> 01:21:06,750
yeah yeah so people are gonna be pushing
 

3985
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:08,730
yeah yeah so people are gonna be pushing
simultaneously on a bunch of different

3986
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:08,740
simultaneously on a bunch of different
 

3987
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:11,250
simultaneously on a bunch of different
directions one direction of course is

3988
01:21:11,250 --> 01:21:11,260
directions one direction of course is
 

3989
01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:13,370
directions one direction of course is
just making the cube it's better right

3990
01:21:13,370 --> 01:21:13,380
just making the cube it's better right
 

3991
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:15,570
just making the cube it's better right
and you know there's there there is

3992
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:15,580
and you know there's there there is
 

3993
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:17,340
and you know there's there there is
tremendous progress there I mean you

3994
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:17,350
tremendous progress there I mean you
 

3995
01:21:17,350 --> 01:21:19,790
tremendous progress there I mean you
know the fidelity is like the the the

3996
01:21:19,790 --> 01:21:19,800
know the fidelity is like the the the
 

3997
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,740
know the fidelity is like the the the
accuracy of the qubits isn't improved by

3998
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:22,750
accuracy of the qubits isn't improved by
 

3999
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:24,750
accuracy of the qubits isn't improved by
several orders of magnitude you know in

4000
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:24,760
several orders of magnitude you know in
 

4001
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:27,840
several orders of magnitude you know in
the you know and the last decade or two

4002
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:27,850
the you know and the last decade or two
 

4003
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:30,870
the you know and the last decade or two
okay the second thing is designing

4004
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:30,880
okay the second thing is designing
 

4005
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,270
okay the second thing is designing
better our you know let's say lower

4006
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:33,280
better our you know let's say lower
 

4007
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:36,720
better our you know let's say lower
overhead error correcting codes and even

4008
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:36,730
overhead error correcting codes and even
 

4009
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:39,210
overhead error correcting codes and even
short of doing the full recursive error

4010
01:21:39,210 --> 01:21:39,220
short of doing the full recursive error
 

4011
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:41,010
short of doing the full recursive error
correction you know there were these

4012
01:21:41,010 --> 01:21:41,020
correction you know there were these
 

4013
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:43,830
correction you know there were these
error mitigation strategies that you can

4014
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:43,840
error mitigation strategies that you can
 

4015
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:47,460
error mitigation strategies that you can
use you know that may you know allow you

4016
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:47,470
use you know that may you know allow you
 

4017
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:51,390
use you know that may you know allow you
to eke out a useful speed-up in in the

4018
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:51,400
to eke out a useful speed-up in in the
 

4019
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,820
to eke out a useful speed-up in in the
near term and then the third thing is

4020
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:53,830
near term and then the third thing is
 

4021
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:56,430
near term and then the third thing is
just taking the quantum algorithms for

4022
01:21:56,430 --> 01:21:56,440
just taking the quantum algorithms for
 

4023
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:58,980
just taking the quantum algorithms for
simulating quantum chemistry or

4024
01:21:58,980 --> 01:21:58,990
simulating quantum chemistry or
 

4025
01:21:58,990 --> 01:22:01,530
simulating quantum chemistry or
materials and making them more efficient

4026
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:01,540
materials and making them more efficient
 

4027
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:03,360
materials and making them more efficient
you know and those algorithms are

4028
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:03,370
you know and those algorithms are
 

4029
01:22:03,370 --> 01:22:05,850
you know and those algorithms are
already dramatically more efficient than

4030
01:22:05,850 --> 01:22:05,860
already dramatically more efficient than
 

4031
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:07,710
already dramatically more efficient than
they were let's say five years ago and

4032
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:07,720
they were let's say five years ago and
 

4033
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:09,720
they were let's say five years ago and
so when you know I quoted these

4034
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:09,730
so when you know I quoted these
 

4035
01:22:09,730 --> 01:22:12,600
so when you know I quoted these
estimates like you know circuit depth of

4036
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:12,610
estimates like you know circuit depth of
 

4037
01:22:12,610 --> 01:22:14,610
estimates like you know circuit depth of
1 million and so you know I hope that

4038
01:22:14,610 --> 01:22:14,620
1 million and so you know I hope that
 

4039
01:22:14,620 --> 01:22:16,950
1 million and so you know I hope that
because people will care enough that

4040
01:22:16,950 --> 01:22:16,960
because people will care enough that
 

4041
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:19,050
because people will care enough that
these numbers are going to come down so

4042
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:19,060
these numbers are going to come down so
 

4043
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:22,200
these numbers are going to come down so
you're one of the the world-class

4044
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:22,210
you're one of the the world-class
 

4045

01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:25,150
researchers in this space there's a few
 

4047
01:22:25,150 --> 01:22:26,760
researchers in this space there's a few
groups that we mentioned Google and IBM

when they're taking in news headings

4080
01:23:15,870 --> 01:23:15,880
when they're taking in news headings
 

4081
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:19,459
when they're taking in news headings
that Google achieved quantum supremacy

4082
01:23:19,459 --> 01:23:19,469
that Google achieved quantum supremacy
 

4083
01:23:19,469 --> 01:23:21,930
that Google achieved quantum supremacy
what should we look out for where's the

4084
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:21,940
what should we look out for where's the
 

4085
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:23,820
what should we look out for where's the
Charlatans in the space where's the BS

4086
01:23:23,820 --> 01:23:23,830
Charlatans in the space where's the BS
 

4087
01:23:23,830 --> 01:23:29,040
Charlatans in the space where's the BS
yeah so a good question unfortunately

4088
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:29,050
yeah so a good question unfortunately
 

4089
01:23:29,050 --> 01:23:31,280
yeah so a good question unfortunately
quantum computing is a little bit like

4090
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:31,290
quantum computing is a little bit like
 

4091
01:23:31,290 --> 01:23:32,729
quantum computing is a little bit like
cryptocurrency

4092

cryptocurrency
 

4093
01:23:32,739 --> 01:23:34,709
cryptocurrency
or deep learning and like there is a

4094
01:23:34,709 --> 01:23:34,719
or deep learning and like there is a
 

4095
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:36,530
or deep learning and like there is a
core of something that is genuinely

4096
01:23:36,530 --> 01:23:36,540
core of something that is genuinely
 

4097
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:39,479
core of something that is genuinely
revolutionary and exciting and because

4098
01:23:39,479 --> 01:23:39,489
revolutionary and exciting and because
 

4099
01:23:39,489 --> 01:23:42,060
revolutionary and exciting and because
of that core it attracts this sort of

4100
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:42,070
of that core it attracts this sort of
 

4101
01:23:42,070 --> 01:23:45,060
of that core it attracts this sort of
vast penumbra of you know people making

4102
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:45,070
vast penumbra of you know people making
 

4103
01:23:45,070 --> 01:23:48,330
vast penumbra of you know people making
you know just utterly ridiculous claims

4104
01:23:48,330 --> 01:23:48,340
you know just utterly ridiculous claims
 

4105
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:51,689
you know just utterly ridiculous claims
and so with with quantum computing I

4106
01:23:51,689 --> 01:23:51,699
and so with with quantum computing I
 

4107
01:23:51,699 --> 01:23:55,080
and so with with quantum computing I
mean I would say that the main way that

4108
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:55,090
mean I would say that the main way that
 

4109
01:23:55,090 --> 01:23:57,689
mean I would say that the main way that
people go astray is by you know not

4110
01:23:57,689 --> 01:23:57,699
people go astray is by you know not
 

4111
01:23:57,699 --> 01:24:00,689
people go astray is by you know not
focusing on sort of the question of you

4112
01:24:00,689 --> 01:24:00,699
focusing on sort of the question of you
 

4113
01:24:00,699 --> 01:24:02,580
focusing on sort of the question of you
know are you getting a speed-up over a

4114
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:02,590
know are you getting a speed-up over a
 

4115
01:24:02,590 --> 01:24:05,669
know are you getting a speed-up over a
classical computer or not right and so

4116
01:24:05,669 --> 01:24:05,679
classical computer or not right and so
 

4117
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:09,030
classical computer or not right and so
so you know people have like a dismissed

4118
01:24:09,030 --> 01:24:09,040
so you know people have like a dismissed
 

4119
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:11,130
so you know people have like a dismissed
quantum supremacy because it's not

4120
01:24:11,130 --> 01:24:11,140
quantum supremacy because it's not
 

4121
01:24:11,140 --> 01:24:13,709
quantum supremacy because it's not
useful right or you know it's not itself

4122
01:24:13,709 --> 01:24:13,719
useful right or you know it's not itself
 

4123
01:24:13,719 --> 01:24:15,720
useful right or you know it's not itself
let's say obviously useful for anything

let's say obviously useful for anything
 

4125
01:24:15,730 --> 01:24:18,510
let's say obviously useful for anything
okay but you know ironically these are

speed-up over a classical computer or
 

4161
01:24:57,969 --> 01:25:00,030
speed-up over a classical computer or
not and you know if so how you know how

01:25:00,030 --> 01:25:00,040
not and you know if so how you know how
 

4163
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:02,520
not and you know if so how you know how
how do you know have you really thought

carefully about classical algorithms to
 

4167
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:07,050
carefully about classical algorithms to
do you know to solve the same problem

quantum computers have been things like

4180
01:25:21,690 --> 01:25:21,700
quantum computers have been things like
 

4181
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:27,240

01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:27,250
machine learning AI optimization okay
 

4183
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:29,880
machine learning AI optimization okay
and the problem with that is that since

4184
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:29,890
and the problem with that is that since
 

4185
01:25:29,890 --> 01:25:32,370
and the problem with that is that since
the very beginning you know even if you

4186
01:25:32,370 --> 01:25:32,380
the very beginning you know even if you
 

4187
01:25:32,380 --> 01:25:35,490
the very beginning you know even if you
have a perfect you know fault tolerant

4188
01:25:35,490 --> 01:25:35,500
have a perfect you know fault tolerant
 

4189
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:38,760
have a perfect you know fault tolerant
you know quantum c'mon um computer you

4190
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:38,770
you know quantum c'mon um computer you
 

4191
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:42,660
you know quantum c'mon um computer you
know we have known of only modest speed

4192
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:42,670
know we have known of only modest speed
 

4193
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:44,480
know we have known of only modest speed
ups that you can get for these problems

4194
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:44,490
ups that you can get for these problems
 

4195
01:25:44,490 --> 01:25:48,150
ups that you can get for these problems
okay so so there is a famous quantum

4196
01:25:48,150 --> 01:25:48,160
okay so so there is a famous quantum
 

4197
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,850
okay so so there is a famous quantum
algorithm called Grover's algorithm okay

4198
01:25:50,850 --> 01:25:50,860
algorithm called Grover's algorithm okay
 

4199
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:52,830
algorithm called Grover's algorithm okay
and what it can do is it can solve many

01:25:52,830 --> 01:25:52,840
and what it can do is it can solve many
 

4201
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:55,560
and what it can do is it can solve many
many of the problems that arise in AI

4202
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:55,570
many of the problems that arise in AI
 

4203
01:25:55,570 --> 01:25:58,800
many of the problems that arise in AI
machine learning optimization including

01:25:58,800 --> 01:25:58,810
machine learning optimization including
 

4205
01:25:58,810 --> 01:26:01,110
machine learning optimization including
np-complete problems okay but it can

4206
01:26:01,110 --> 01:26:01,120
np-complete problems okay but it can
 

4207
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:03,330
np-complete problems okay but it can
solve them in about the square root of

4208
01:26:03,330 --> 01:26:03,340
solve them in about the square root of
 

4209
01:26:03,340 --> 01:26:05,460
solve them in about the square root of
the number of steps that a classical

4210
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:05,470
the number of steps that a classical
 

4211
01:26:05,470 --> 01:26:07,170
the number of steps that a classical
computer would need for the same

4212
01:26:07,170 --> 01:26:07,180
computer would need for the same
 

4213
01:26:07,180 --> 01:26:09,720
computer would need for the same
problems okay now a square root speed-up

4214
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:09,730
problems okay now a square root speed-up
 

4215
01:26:09,730 --> 01:26:12,150
problems okay now a square root speed-up
is you know important it's impressive

4216
01:26:12,150 --> 01:26:12,160
is you know important it's impressive
 

4217
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:14,850
is you know important it's impressive
it is not an exponential speed-up okay

4218
01:26:14,850 --> 01:26:14,860
it is not an exponential speed-up okay
 

4219
01:26:14,860 --> 01:26:17,430
it is not an exponential speed-up okay
so it is not the kind of game-changer

4220
01:26:17,430 --> 01:26:17,440
so it is not the kind of game-changer
 

4221
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:19,740
so it is not the kind of game-changer
that lets say Shor's algorithm for

4222
01:26:19,740 --> 01:26:19,750
that lets say Shor's algorithm for
 

4223
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:21,810
that lets say Shor's algorithm for
factoring is or for that matter that

4224
01:26:21,810 --> 01:26:21,820
factoring is or for that matter that
 

4225
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:23,850
factoring is or for that matter that
simulation of quantum mechanics is okay

4226
01:26:23,850 --> 01:26:23,860
simulation of quantum mechanics is okay
 

4227
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:26,610
simulation of quantum mechanics is okay
it is a more modest speed up let's say

4228
01:26:26,610 --> 01:26:26,620
it is a more modest speed up let's say
 

4229
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:28,860
it is a more modest speed up let's say
you know roughly you know in theory it

4230
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:28,870
you know roughly you know in theory it
 

4231
01:26:28,870 --> 01:26:30,510
you know roughly you know in theory it
could roughly double the size of the

4232
01:26:30,510 --> 01:26:30,520
could roughly double the size of the
 

4233
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:32,280
could roughly double the size of the
optimization problems that you could

4234
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:32,290
optimization problems that you could
 

4235
01:26:32,290 --> 01:26:34,890
optimization problems that you could
handle right and and so what you know

4236
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:34,900
handle right and and so what you know
 

4237
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:38,550
handle right and and so what you know
because people found that I guess to to

4238
01:26:38,550 --> 01:26:38,560
because people found that I guess to to
 

4239
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:41,520
because people found that I guess to to
boring or you know to unimpressive you

4240
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:41,530
boring or you know to unimpressive you
 

4241
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:43,860
boring or you know to unimpressive you
know they've gone on to to like invent

4242
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:43,870
know they've gone on to to like invent
 

4243
01:26:43,870 --> 01:26:46,560
know they've gone on to to like invent
all of these heuristic algorithms where

4244
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:46,570
all of these heuristic algorithms where
 

4245
01:26:46,570 --> 01:26:47,820
all of these heuristic algorithms where
you know because no one really

4246
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:47,830
you know because no one really
 

4247
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:50,100
you know because no one really
understands them you can just project

4248
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:50,110
understands them you can just project
 

4249
01:26:50,110 --> 01:26:52,830
understands them you can just project
your hopes on to them right that well

4250
01:26:52,830 --> 01:26:52,840
your hopes on to them right that well
 

4251
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:55,320
your hopes on to them right that well
maybe it gets an exponential speed-up

4252
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:55,330
maybe it gets an exponential speed-up
 

4253
01:26:55,330 --> 01:26:57,570
maybe it gets an exponential speed-up
you can't prove that it doesn't you know

4254
01:26:57,570 --> 01:26:57,580
you can't prove that it doesn't you know
 

4255
01:26:57,580 --> 01:26:59,340
you can't prove that it doesn't you know
and the burden is on you to prove that

4256
01:26:59,340 --> 01:26:59,350
and the burden is on you to prove that
 

4257
01:26:59,350 --> 01:27:01,260
and the burden is on you to prove that
it doesn't get a speed-up right and you

4258
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:01,270
it doesn't get a speed-up right and you
 

4259
01:27:01,270 --> 01:27:02,820
it doesn't get a speed-up right and you
know so they've done an immense amount

4260
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:02,830
know so they've done an immense amount
 

4261
01:27:02,830 --> 01:27:06,000
know so they've done an immense amount
of that kind of thing and a really

4262
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:06,010
of that kind of thing and a really
 

4263
01:27:06,010 --> 01:27:08,400
of that kind of thing and a really
worrying amount of the case for building

4264
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:08,410
worrying amount of the case for building
 

4265
01:27:08,410 --> 01:27:10,860
worrying amount of the case for building
a quantum computer has come to rest on

4266
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:10,870
a quantum computer has come to rest on
 

4267
01:27:10,870 --> 01:27:12,750
a quantum computer has come to rest on
this stuff that those of us in this

4268
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:12,760
this stuff that those of us in this
 

4269
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:15,090
this stuff that those of us in this
field know perfectly well is on

4270
01:27:15,090 --> 01:27:15,100
field know perfectly well is on
 

4271
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:18,630
field know perfectly well is on
extremely shaky foundations so the

4272
01:27:18,630 --> 01:27:18,640
extremely shaky foundations so the
 

4273
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:21,690
extremely shaky foundations so the
fundamental question is yeah show that

4274
01:27:21,690 --> 01:27:21,700
fundamental question is yeah show that
 

4275
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:24,390
fundamental question is yeah show that
there's a speed-up yes Icicle absolutely

4276
01:27:24,390 --> 01:27:24,400
there's a speed-up yes Icicle absolutely
 

4277
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,490
there's a speed-up yes Icicle absolutely
in this space that you're referring to

4278
01:27:26,490 --> 01:27:26,500
in this space that you're referring to
 

4279
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:28,680
in this space that you're referring to
which is actually interesting the area

4280
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:28,690
which is actually interesting the area
 

4281
01:27:28,690 --> 01:27:30,120
which is actually interesting the area
that a lot of people excited about is

4282
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:30,130
that a lot of people excited about is
 

4283
01:27:30,130 --> 01:27:30,990
that a lot of people excited about is
machine learning

4284
01:27:30,990 --> 01:27:31,000
machine learning
 

4285
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,840
machine learning
yeah so your senses do you think it will

4286
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:33,850
yeah so your senses do you think it will
 

4287
01:27:33,850 --> 01:27:36,600
yeah so your senses do you think it will
so I know that there's a lot of smoke

4288
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:36,610
so I know that there's a lot of smoke
 

4289
01:27:36,610 --> 01:27:38,910
so I know that there's a lot of smoke
currently yeah but do you think they're

4290
01:27:38,910 --> 01:27:38,920
currently yeah but do you think they're
 

4291
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,680
currently yeah but do you think they're
actually eventually might be

4292
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:40,690
actually eventually might be
 

4293
01:27:40,690 --> 01:27:42,330
actually eventually might be
breakthroughs where you do get

4294
01:27:42,330 --> 01:27:42,340
breakthroughs where you do get
 

4295
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:45,689
breakthroughs where you do get
exponential speed ups in the machine

4296
01:27:45,689 --> 01:27:45,699
exponential speed ups in the machine
 

4297
01:27:45,699 --> 01:27:47,610
exponential speed ups in the machine
learning space absolutely there might be

4298
01:27:47,610 --> 01:27:47,620
learning space absolutely there might be
 

4299
01:27:47,620 --> 01:27:50,250
learning space absolutely there might be
I mean I think we know of modest speed

4300
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:50,260
I mean I think we know of modest speed
 

4301
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:51,959
I mean I think we know of modest speed
ups that you can get for these problems

4302
01:27:51,959 --> 01:27:51,969
ups that you can get for these problems
 

4303
01:27:51,969 --> 01:27:54,240

I think you know whether you can get

4304
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:54,250
I think you know whether you can get
 

4305
01:27:54,250 --> 01:27:56,640
I think you know whether you can get
bigger speed ups is one of the the

4306
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:56,650
bigger speed ups is one of the the
 

4307
01:27:56,650 --> 01:27:59,820
bigger speed ups is one of the the
biggest questions for quantum computing

thinking about now you know we had

4312
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:05,170
thinking about now you know we had
 

4313
01:28:05,170 --> 01:28:08,450
thinking about now you know we had
actually recently a really you know a

01:28:30,530 --> 01:28:30,540
had an algorithm for sampling
 

4333
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:33,030
had an algorithm for sampling
recommendations that was exponentially

4334
01:28:33,030 --> 01:28:33,040
recommendations that was exponentially
 

4335
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:34,860

01:28:36,959 --> 01:28:36,969
algorithm right and so I you know a lot
 

4339
01:28:36,969 --> 01:28:38,669
algorithm right and so I you know a lot
of people were excited I was excited

4340
01:28:38,669 --> 01:28:38,679
of people were excited I was excited
 

4341
01:28:38,679 --> 01:28:39,870
of people were excited I was excited
about it

4342
01:28:39,870 --> 01:28:39,880
about it
 

4343
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:42,720
about it
I had an eighteen-year-old undergrad by

4344
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:42,730
I had an eighteen-year-old undergrad by
 

4345
01:28:42,730 --> 01:28:45,630
I had an eighteen-year-old undergrad by
the name of Alain Tang and she was you

4346
01:28:45,630 --> 01:28:45,640
the name of Alain Tang and she was you
 

4347
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:47,430
the name of Alain Tang and she was you
know she was obviously brilliant she was

4348
01:28:47,430 --> 01:28:47,440
know she was obviously brilliant she was
 

4349
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,830
know she was obviously brilliant she was
looking for a project I gave her as a

4350
01:28:49,830 --> 01:28:49,840
looking for a project I gave her as a
 

4351
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:51,930
looking for a project I gave her as a
project can you prove that this speed-up

4352
01:28:51,930 --> 01:28:51,940
project can you prove that this speed-up
 

4353
01:28:51,940 --> 01:28:54,360
project can you prove that this speed-up
is real can you prove that you know any

4354
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:54,370
is real can you prove that you know any
 

4355
01:28:54,370 --> 01:28:56,930
is real can you prove that you know any
classical algorithm would need to access

4356
01:28:56,930 --> 01:28:56,940
classical algorithm would need to access
 

4357
01:28:56,940 --> 01:28:59,370
classical algorithm would need to access
exponentially more data right and you

4358
01:28:59,370 --> 01:28:59,380
exponentially more data right and you
 

4359
01:28:59,380 --> 01:29:00,840
exponentially more data right and you
know this this was a case where if that

4360
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:00,850
know this this was a case where if that
 

4361
01:29:00,850 --> 01:29:03,300
know this this was a case where if that
was true this was not like a P versus NP

4362
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:03,310
was true this was not like a P versus NP
 

4363
01:29:03,310 --> 01:29:05,459
was true this was not like a P versus NP
type of question right this this might

4364
01:29:05,459 --> 01:29:05,469
type of question right this this might
 

4365
01:29:05,469 --> 01:29:08,070
type of question right this this might
well have been provable but she worked

4366
01:29:08,070 --> 01:29:08,080
well have been provable but she worked
 

4367
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:09,930
well have been provable but she worked
on it for a year she couldn't do it

4368
01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:09,940
on it for a year she couldn't do it
 

4369
01:29:09,940 --> 01:29:12,780
on it for a year she couldn't do it
eventually she figured out why she

4370
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:12,790
eventually she figured out why she
 

4371
01:29:12,790 --> 01:29:14,100
eventually she figured out why she
couldn't do it and the reason was that

4372
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:14,110
couldn't do it and the reason was that
 

4373
01:29:14,110 --> 01:29:17,340
couldn't do it and the reason was that
that was false there is a classical

4374
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:17,350
that was false there is a classical
 

4375
01:29:17,350 --> 01:29:19,560
that was false there is a classical
algorithm with a similar performance to

algorithm with a similar performance to
 

4377
01:29:19,570 --> 01:29:22,080
algorithm with a similar performance to
the quantum algorithm so even succeeded

4378
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:22,090
the quantum algorithm so even succeeded
 

4379
01:29:22,090 --> 01:29:24,479
the quantum algorithm so even succeeded
in D quantizing that machine learning

4380
01:29:24,479 --> 01:29:24,489
in D quantizing that machine learning
 

4381
01:29:24,489 --> 01:29:27,209
in D quantizing that machine learning
algorithm and then in the last couple of

4382
01:29:27,209 --> 01:29:27,219
algorithm and then in the last couple of
 

4383
01:29:27,219 --> 01:29:30,000

01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:38,250
have now also been D quantized yeah okay
and so I would say again

4392
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:38,260
and so I would say again
 

4393
01:29:38,260 --> 01:29:42,360
and so I would say again
backwards step yes a like a yes or a

4394
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:42,370
backwards step yes a like a yes or a
 

4395
01:29:42,370 --> 01:29:44,070
backwards step yes a like a yes or a
forward step for science but well yeah

4396
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:44,080
forward step for science but well yeah
 

4397
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:47,190
forward step for science but well yeah
step for a machine-learning yeah that

4398
01:29:47,190 --> 01:29:47,200
step for a machine-learning yeah that
 

4399
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:50,790
step for a machine-learning yeah that
that precedes the big next forward step

4400
01:29:50,790 --> 01:29:50,800
that precedes the big next forward step
 

4401
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:52,530
that precedes the big next forward step
right right right now if it's bright now

4402
01:29:52,530 --> 01:29:52,540
right right right now if it's bright now
 

4403
01:29:52,540 --> 01:29:54,690
right right right now if it's bright now
some people will say well you know

4404
01:29:54,690 --> 01:29:54,700
some people will say well you know
 

4405
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:56,850
some people will say well you know
there's a silver lining in this cloud

4406
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:56,860
there's a silver lining in this cloud
 

4407
01:29:56,860 --> 01:29:58,320
there's a silver lining in this cloud
they say well look thinking about

4408
01:29:58,320 --> 01:29:58,330
they say well look thinking about
 

4409
01:29:58,330 --> 01:30:00,030
they say well look thinking about
quantum computing has led to the

4410
01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:00,040
quantum computing has led to the
 

4411
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:02,729
quantum computing has led to the
discovery of potentially useful new

4412
01:30:02,729 --> 01:30:02,739
discovery of potentially useful new

classical algorithm it's true right

4414
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:04,630
classical algorithm it's true right
 

4415
01:30:04,630 --> 01:30:05,850
classical algorithm it's true right
and so you know so you get these

4416
01:30:05,850 --> 01:30:05,860
and so you know so you get these
 

4417
01:30:05,860 --> 01:30:08,430
and so you know so you get these
spin-off applications but if you want a

4418
01:30:08,430 --> 01:30:08,440
spin-off applications but if you want a
 

4419
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:10,290
spin-off applications but if you want a
quantum speed-up you really have to

4420
01:30:10,290 --> 01:30:10,300
quantum speed-up you really have to
 

4421
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:12,300
quantum speed-up you really have to
think carefully about that you know e

4422
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:12,310
think carefully about that you know e
 

4423
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:14,520
think carefully about that you know e

01:30:19,630 --> 01:30:22,170
the challenge you know that you know
that the the field is now open right
