experiment I would say and
so if you have these flaws as

222
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:00,480
so if you have these flaws as
 

223

so if you have these flaws as
institutions one thing to do

00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:02,760
institutions one thing to do
 

225
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,490
institutions one thing to do
as the Communists did at the beginning

226
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:04,500
as the Communists did at the beginning
 

227
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,110
as the Communists did at the beginning
of the 20th century is to burn the thing

228
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:06,120
of the 20th century is to burn the thing
 

229
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,289
of the 20th century is to burn the thing
down and start in you and the other is

230
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:09,299
down and start in you and the other is
 

231
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:13,490
down and start in you and the other is
to fix from within one step one slow

232
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:13,500
to fix from within one step one slow
 

233
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,530
to fix from within one step one slow
step at a time what's what's the case

234
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:15,540
step at a time what's what's the case
 

235
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,870
step at a time what's what's the case
for both from a history perspective sure

236
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:17,880
for both from a history perspective sure
 

237
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,569
for both from a history perspective sure
so historically there has uh always been

238
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:20,579
so historically there has uh always been
 

239
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,189
so historically there has uh always been
an urge to burn down the institutions

240
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:22,199
an urge to burn down the institutions
 

241
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,990
an urge to burn down the institutions

and start again start with a blank slate
 

243
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,790
and start again start with a blank slate
uh the historical record is that almost

244
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:25,800
uh the historical record is that almost
 

245
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,770

you destroy the institutions you gave

248
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:29,220
you destroy the institutions you gave
 

249
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,850
you destroy the institutions you gave
the example of the Bolshevik Revolution

250
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:31,860
the example of the Bolshevik Revolution
 

251
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,490
the example of the Bolshevik Revolution
when you destroy the institutions all

252
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:34,500
when you destroy the institutions all
 

253
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,590
when you destroy the institutions all
you do is in the jungle that's left

254
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:36,600
you do is in the jungle that's left
 

255
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,810
you do is in the jungle that's left
behind you give advantages to those who

256
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:38,820
behind you give advantages to those who
 

257
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,909
behind you give advantages to those who
are the most powerful institutions

258
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:40,919
are the most powerful institutions
 

259
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,670
are the most powerful institutions
always Place certain limits upon the

260
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:43,680
always Place certain limits upon the
 

261
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,230
always Place certain limits upon the
most powerful in the jungle if you go

262
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:45,240
most powerful in the jungle if you go
 

263
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,090
most powerful in the jungle if you go
back to the Jungle the most powerful are

264
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:47,100
back to the Jungle the most powerful are
 

265
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,650
back to the Jungle the most powerful are
actually going to have the most

266
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:48,660
actually going to have the most
 

267
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,749
actually going to have the most
influence and most control so the

268
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:50,759
influence and most control so the
 

269
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,070
influence and most control so the
revolutionaries who are usually the

270
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,080
revolutionaries who are usually the
 

271
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,350
revolutionaries who are usually the
vulnerable turn out to then be the

272
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:54,360
vulnerable turn out to then be the
 

273
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,790
vulnerable turn out to then be the
victims of the Revolution and this is

274
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:55,800
victims of the Revolution and this is
 

275
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,350
victims of the Revolution and this is
exactly what we saw with the French

276
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,360
exactly what we saw with the French
 

277
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,670
exactly what we saw with the French
Revolution with the Russian Revolution

278
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:58,680
Revolution with the Russian Revolution
 

279
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,650
Revolution with the Russian Revolution
so the record for that is not a great

280
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:00,660
so the record for that is not a great
 

281
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,090
so the record for that is not a great
record there still might be times to do

282
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:02,100
record there still might be times to do
 

283
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,010
record there still might be times to do
that but I think we should be very

284
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:04,020
that but I think we should be very
 

285
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,450
that but I think we should be very
cautious about that the record for

286
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:05,460
cautious about that the record for
 

287
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,430
cautious about that the record for
working through institutions is better

288
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
working through institutions is better
 

289
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,590
working through institutions is better
record now what we have to be careful

290
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
record now what we have to be careful
 

291
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,790
record now what we have to be careful
about is as we're working through

292
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:10,800
about is as we're working through
 

293
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,590
about is as we're working through
institutions not to become bought into

294
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:12,600
institutions not to become bought into
 

295
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,990
institutions not to become bought into
them not to become of those institutions

296
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:15,000
them not to become of those institutions
 

297
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,210
them not to become of those institutions
so what I've written about in this book

298
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:17,220
so what I've written about in this book
 

299
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,590
so what I've written about in this book
and in other books my book on Henry

00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:18,600
and in other books my book on Henry
 

301
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,510
and in other books my book on Henry
Kissinger for example is how it's

302
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:20,520
Kissinger for example is how it's
 

303
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,310
Kissinger for example is how it's
important when in an institution to

304
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:22,320
important when in an institution to
 

305
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,950
important when in an institution to
still bring an outsider perspective I

306
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:24,960
still bring an outsider perspective I
 

307
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,890
still bring an outsider perspective I
believe in being an inside Outsider and

308
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:27,900
believe in being an inside Outsider and
 

309

I think most of your listeners are
 

311
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,469
I think most of your listeners are
inside Outsiders they're people who care

inside Outsiders they're people who care
 

313
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,510
inside Outsiders they're people who care
about what's going on inside but they're

314
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:32,520
about what's going on inside but they're
 

315
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,830
about what's going on inside but they're
bringing some new ideas from the outside

316
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
bringing some new ideas from the outside
 

317
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,689
bringing some new ideas from the outside
I think the correct statement to say is

318
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:35,699
I think the correct statement to say is
 

319
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:37,670
I think the correct statement to say is
most of the listeners most people aspire

320
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,680
most of the listeners most people aspire
 

321
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,629
most of the listeners most people aspire
to be inside or Outsiders

322
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639
to be inside or Outsiders
 

323
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,850
to be inside or Outsiders
but we human nature such that we easily

324
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:43,860
but we human nature such that we easily
 

325
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,330
but we human nature such that we easily

this game it's tough It's really tough

394
00:06:59,330 --> 00:06:59,340
this game it's tough It's really tough
 

395
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,070
this game it's tough It's really tough
it takes a special kind of human being

396
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:01,080
it takes a special kind of human being
 

397
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,189
it takes a special kind of human being
as opposed to being a

398
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:03,199
as opposed to being a
 

399
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,150
as opposed to being a
anti-establishment on everything which

400
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:05,160
anti-establishment on everything which
 

401
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,670
anti-establishment on everything which
also gets a lot of uh attention

402
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:07,680
also gets a lot of uh attention
 

403
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,090
also gets a lot of uh attention
but being just enough anti-establishment

404
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:11,100
but being just enough anti-establishment
 

405
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,909
but being just enough anti-establishment
to figure out ideas how to improve the

406
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:13,919
to figure out ideas how to improve the
 

407
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,129
to figure out ideas how to improve the
establishment this is such a tricky

408
00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:16,139
establishment this is such a tricky
 

409
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,770
establishment this is such a tricky
place to operate I agree I I like the

410
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:18,780
place to operate I agree I I like the
 

411
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,110
place to operate I agree I I like the
word iconoclastic I think it's important

412
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
word iconoclastic I think it's important
 

413
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,170
word iconoclastic I think it's important
to be an iconoclast which is to say you

414
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:24,180
to be an iconoclast which is to say you
 

415
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,890
to be an iconoclast which is to say you
love ideas you're serious about ideas

416
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:26,900
love ideas you're serious about ideas
 

417
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,150
love ideas you're serious about ideas
but you're never comfortable with

418
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:29,160
but you're never comfortable with
 

419
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,290
but you're never comfortable with
consensus

420
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:30,300
consensus
 

421
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,270
consensus
and I write about that in this book I've

422
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:32,280
and I write about that in this book I've
 

423
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,469
and I write about that in this book I've
written about that actually a lot in the

424
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:33,479
written about that actually a lot in the
 

425
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:36,110
written about that actually a lot in the
New York Times too I I think consensus

426
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:36,120
New York Times too I I think consensus
 

427
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,550
New York Times too I I think consensus
is overstated

428
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:37,560
is overstated
 

429
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,249
is overstated

just shouting with a megaphone that
 

497
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:45,769
just shouting with a megaphone that

kind of classic role and people don't
 

509
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:56,870
kind of classic role and people don't
like to hear it you know I like to

00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:56,880
like to hear it you know I like to
 

511
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,630
like to hear it you know I like to
believe that people are acting out of

Goodwill which I think they usually are

514
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:01,080
Goodwill which I think they usually are
 

515
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,630
Goodwill which I think they usually are
and that people are open to new ideas

516
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:02,640
and that people are open to new ideas
 

517
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,090
and that people are open to new ideas
but you find very quickly even those who

518
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:05,100
but you find very quickly even those who
 

519
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,650
but you find very quickly even those who
you think are open-minded once they've

520
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:06,660
you think are open-minded once they've
 

521
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,329
you think are open-minded once they've
committed themselves and put their money

522
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:08,339
committed themselves and put their money
 

523
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,970
committed themselves and put their money
and their reputation on the line they

524
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:10,980
and their reputation on the line they
 

525
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,949
and their reputation on the line they
don't want to hear otherwise so in a

don't want to hear otherwise so in a
sense what you say is the bigger than

even being an iconoclast that's being

00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:16,980
even being an iconoclast that's being
 

531
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,470
even being an iconoclast that's being
able to persuade and work with people

532
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:18,480
able to persuade and work with people
 

533
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,050
able to persuade and work with people
who are afraid of your ideas yeah I

534
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:21,060
who are afraid of your ideas yeah I
 

535
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,430
who are afraid of your ideas yeah I
think the the key is like in

536
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:22,440
think the the key is like in
 

537
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,009
think the the key is like in
conversations is to get people out of a

538
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:25,019
conversations is to get people out of a
 

539
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,290
conversations is to get people out of a
defensive position like uh make them

540
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:27,300
defensive position like uh make them
 

541
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,570
defensive position like uh make them
realize we're on the same side we're

542
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:29,580
realize we're on the same side we're
 

543
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,269
realize we're on the same side we're
brothers and sisters and from that place

544
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:32,279
brothers and sisters and from that place
 

545
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,490
brothers and sisters and from that place
I think you just raise the question it's

546
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:34,500
I think you just raise the question it's
 

547
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,949
I think you just raise the question it's
like a little it's a little a little

548
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
like a little it's a little a little
 

549
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,009
like a little it's a little a little
thought that just lands and then I've

550
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:40,019
thought that just lands and then I've
 

551
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:41,990
thought that just lands and then I've
noticed this time and time again

552
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,000
noticed this time and time again
 

553
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,329
noticed this time and time again
just a little subtle thing and then

554
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:44,339
just a little subtle thing and then
 

555
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:47,090
just a little subtle thing and then
months later it percolates somewhere in

556
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:47,100
months later it percolates somewhere in
 

557
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,470
months later it percolates somewhere in
the mind it's like all right well that

558
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:48,480
the mind it's like all right well that
 

559
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,910
the mind it's like all right well that
little doubt

560
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:49,920
little doubt
 

561
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,829
little doubt
um because I also realized in these

562
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:51,839
um because I also realized in these
 

563
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,750
um because I also realized in these
battles when dip when especially

564
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,760
battles when dip when especially
 

565
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,490
battles when dip when especially
political battles

566
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:55,500
political battles
 

567
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,070
political battles
people often don't

568
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,080
people often don't
 

569
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,769
people often don't
have folks on their side

570
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:00,779
have folks on their side
 

571
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:03,949
have folks on their side
like that they can really trust

572
00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:03,959
like that they can really trust
 

573
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,590
like that they can really trust
as a fellow human being to challenge

574
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:06,600
as a fellow human being to challenge
 

575
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,690
as a fellow human being to challenge
them that's a very difficult role to be

576
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:08,700
them that's a very difficult role to be
 

577
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,150
them that's a very difficult role to be
in and because in these battles you kind

578
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:11,160
in and because in these battles you kind
 

579
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,949
in and because in these battles you kind
of have a tribe and you have a set of

580
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:12,959
of have a tribe and you have a set of
 

581
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,329
of have a tribe and you have a set of
ideas and there's another tribe you have

582
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:14,339
ideas and there's another tribe you have
 

583
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:16,310
ideas and there's another tribe you have
a set of ideas and when somebody says

584
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,320
a set of ideas and when somebody says
 

585
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,290
a set of ideas and when somebody says
something Conor to your Viewpoint you

586
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:18,300
something Conor to your Viewpoint you
 

587
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,550
something Conor to your Viewpoint you
almost always want to put them in the

588
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:19,560
almost always want to put them in the
 

589
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,610
almost always want to put them in the
other tribe as opposed to having

590
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:21,620
other tribe as opposed to having
 

591
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,810
other tribe as opposed to having
truly listening to another person that

592
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:23,820
truly listening to another person that
 

593
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,150
truly listening to another person that
takes uh skill But ultimately I think

594
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:26,160
takes uh skill But ultimately I think
 

595
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,550
takes uh skill But ultimately I think
that's the way to bridge these divides

596
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:28,560
that's the way to bridge these divides
 

597
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,490
that's the way to bridge these divides
is having these kinds of conversations

598
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:30,500
is having these kinds of conversations
 

599
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,530
is having these kinds of conversations
that's why I'm actually

600
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:32,540
that's why I'm actually
 

601
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,329
that's why I'm actually

power of social media to do that if if

see different sides of the argument but
 

641

is a Humanity a human desire for freedom
and a human desire to improve oneself

914

the slaves themselves

946
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:55,560
the slaves themselves
 

947
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,769
the slaves themselves
fought for their freedom and they won

00:16:57,769 --> 00:16:57,779
fought for their freedom and they won
 

949
00:16:57,779 --> 00:16:59,449

00:16:59,449 --> 00:16:59,459
their freedom I don't think it's a war
 

951
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:00,829
their freedom I don't think it's a war
about slavery I think it's a war about

00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:02,930
about slavery I think it's a war about
freedom because if you say it's a war

954
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:02,940
freedom because if you say it's a war
 

955
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,909
freedom because if you say it's a war
about slavery then it sounds like it's

956
00:17:04,909 --> 00:17:04,919
about slavery then it sounds like it's
 

957
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:07,370
about slavery then it sounds like it's
an argument between the slave masters

958
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:07,380
an argument between the slave masters
 

959
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,610
an argument between the slave masters
and the other white guys who didn't want

960
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:10,620
and the other white guys who didn't want
 

961
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,049
and the other white guys who didn't want
slavery to exist and of course that

962
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:12,059
slavery to exist and of course that
 

963
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:14,750
slavery to exist and of course that

states how many people
 

1135
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,570
states how many people

uh what's like the the demographics and
the Dynamics of of each side the union

1138

the Dynamics of of each side the union

the Dynamics of of each side the union
side is much much larger right in terms

00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:29,160
side is much much larger right in terms
 

1141
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,770
side is much much larger right in terms
of population I have about 22 million

1142
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:30,780
of population I have about 22 million
 

1143
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,650
of population I have about 22 million
people uh and it is what we would today

1144
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:33,660
people uh and it is what we would today
 

1145
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,930
people uh and it is what we would today
recognize as all the states uh basically

1146
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:35,940
recognize as all the states uh basically
 

1147
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,690
recognize as all the states uh basically
uh north of Virginia the south is the

1148
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:38,700
uh north of Virginia the south is the
 

1149
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,330
uh north of Virginia the south is the
states in the south of the Mason-Dixon

1150
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:41,340
states in the south of the Mason-Dixon
 

1151
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,270
states in the south of the Mason-Dixon
line so Virginia and there on South West

1152
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:44,280
line so Virginia and there on South West
 

1153
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,310
line so Virginia and there on South West
through Tennessee so Texas for example

1154
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:46,320
through Tennessee so Texas for example
 

1155
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,169
through Tennessee so Texas for example
is in the Confederacy Tennessee's in the

1156
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:48,179
is in the Confederacy Tennessee's in the
 

1157
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:50,630
is in the Confederacy Tennessee's in the
Confederacy uh but other states like

1158
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:50,640
Confederacy uh but other states like
 

1159
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,590
Confederacy uh but other states like
Missouri are border border states and

1160
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:54,600
Missouri are border border states and
 

1161
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,990
Missouri are border border states and
um the the Confederacy is a much smaller

1162
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:57,000
um the the Confederacy is a much smaller
 

1163
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,510
um the the Confederacy is a much smaller
entity uh it's made up of about nine

1164
00:20:59,510 --> 00:20:59,520
entity uh it's made up of about nine
 

1165
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,430
entity uh it's made up of about nine
million people plus about 4 million

1166
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:01,440
million people plus about 4 million
 

1167
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,810
million people plus about 4 million
slaves and it is a agricultural economy

1168
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:05,820
slaves and it is a agricultural economy
 

1169
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,549
slaves and it is a agricultural economy
whereas the northern economy is a more

1170
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:07,559
whereas the northern economy is a more
 

1171
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,890
whereas the northern economy is a more
industrializing economy interestingly

1172
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:09,900
industrializing economy interestingly
 

1173
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,570
industrializing economy interestingly
enough the Confederate states are in

1174
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:11,580
enough the Confederate states are in
 

1175
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,570
enough the Confederate states are in
some ways more International than the

1176
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:14,580
some ways more International than the
 

1177
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,730
some ways more International than the
northern states because they are

1178
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:16,740
northern states because they are
 

1179
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,669
northern states because they are
exporters of cotton exporters of tobacco

1180
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:19,679
exporters of cotton exporters of tobacco
 

1181
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,770
exporters of cotton exporters of tobacco
so they actually have very strong

1182
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:21,780
so they actually have very strong
 

1183
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,510
so they actually have very strong
International economic ties very strong

1184
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:23,520
International economic ties very strong
 

1185
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,430
International economic ties very strong
ties to Great Britain the United States

1186
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:25,440
ties to Great Britain the United States
 

1187
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,230
ties to Great Britain the United States
was the largest source of cotton to the

1188
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:27,240
was the largest source of cotton to the
 

1189
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,029
was the largest source of cotton to the
world before the Civil War Egypt

1190
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:29,039
world before the Civil War Egypt
 

1191
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,830
world before the Civil War Egypt
replaces that a little bit during the

1192
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:30,840
replaces that a little bit during the
 

1193
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,710
replaces that a little bit during the
Civil War but all the English textiles

1194
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:33,720
Civil War but all the English textiles
 

1195
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,070
Civil War but all the English textiles
were American cotton from the south and

1196
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:37,080
were American cotton from the south and
 

1197
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,950
were American cotton from the south and
so uh it is the southern half of what we

1198
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:39,960
so uh it is the southern half of what we
 

1199
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,390
so uh it is the southern half of what we
would call the eastern part of the

1200
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:41,400
would call the eastern part of the
 

1201
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,950
would call the eastern part of the
United States today with far fewer

1202
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:42,960
United States today with far fewer
 

1203
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,289
United States today with far fewer
people it's made up the Confederacy is

1204
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:45,299
people it's made up the Confederacy is
 

1205
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:48,350
people it's made up the Confederacy is
of landed families wealth in the

1206
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:48,360
of landed families wealth in the
 

1207
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,649
of landed families wealth in the
Confederacy was land and slaves the

1208
00:21:51,649 --> 00:21:51,659
Confederacy was land and slaves the
 

1209
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:53,270
Confederacy was land and slaves the
northern United States is made up

1210
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:53,280
northern United States is made up
 

1211
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,850
northern United States is made up
predominantly of small business owners

1212
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:55,860
predominantly of small business owners
 

1213
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,490
predominantly of small business owners
and then larger Financial interests such

1214
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:58,500
and then larger Financial interests such
 

1215
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,330
and then larger Financial interests such
as the banks in New York

1216
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:01,340
as the banks in New York
 

1217
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:04,010
as the banks in New York
and what about the military who are the

1218
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:04,020
and what about the military who are the
 

1219
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,110
and what about the military who are the
people that picked out guns what are the

1220
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:06,120
people that picked out guns what are the
 

1221
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,149
people that picked out guns what are the
numbers there so the the union also

1222
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:08,159
numbers there so the the union also
 

1223
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,010
numbers there so the the union also
outnumbered a Confederate by far but

1224
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:10,020
outnumbered a Confederate by far but
 

1225
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,390
outnumbered a Confederate by far but
it's a really interesting question

1226
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:11,400
it's a really interesting question
 

1227
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,950
it's a really interesting question
because there's no conscription in the

1228
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:12,960
because there's no conscription in the
 

1229
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,990
because there's no conscription in the
Constitution uh unlike most other

1230
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:15,000
Constitution uh unlike most other
 

1231
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,690
Constitution uh unlike most other
countries our democracy is formed on the

1232
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:17,700
countries our democracy is formed on the
 

1233
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,430
countries our democracy is formed on the
presumption that human beings should not

1234
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:19,440
presumption that human beings should not
 

1235
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,930
presumption that human beings should not
be forced to go into the military if

1236
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:20,940
be forced to go into the military if
 

1237
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,730
be forced to go into the military if
they don't want to most democracies in

1238
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:22,740
they don't want to most democracies in
 

1239
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,470
they don't want to most democracies in
the world today actually still require

1240
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:24,480
the world today actually still require
 

1241
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,270
the world today actually still require
military service the United States is

1242
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:26,280
military service the United States is
 

1243
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,010
military service the United States is
very rarely in its history done that

1244
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:28,020
very rarely in its history done that
 

1245
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,770
very rarely in its history done that
it's not in our constitution so

1246
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:30,780
it's not in our constitution so
 

1247
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,450
it's not in our constitution so
um during the Civil War in the first

1248
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:32,460
um during the Civil War in the first
 

1249
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,010
um during the Civil War in the first
months and years of the Civil War

1250
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:34,020
months and years of the Civil War
 

1251
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,430
months and years of the Civil War
Abraham Lincoln has to go to

1252
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:37,440
Abraham Lincoln has to go to
 

1253
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,350
Abraham Lincoln has to go to
um the different states to the governors

1254
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:39,360
um the different states to the governors
 

1255
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,810
um the different states to the governors
and ask the governors for volunteers

1256
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:41,820
and ask the governors for volunteers
 

1257
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,390
and ask the governors for volunteers
so the men who take up arms especially

1258
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:44,400
so the men who take up arms especially
 

1259
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,490
so the men who take up arms especially
in the first months of the war are

1260
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:46,500
in the first months of the war are
 

1261
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,010
in the first months of the war are
volunteers in the North in the South

1262
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:49,020
volunteers in the North in the South
 

1263
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,870
volunteers in the North in the South
they're actually conscripted

1264
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:50,880
they're actually conscripted
 

1265
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,630
they're actually conscripted
and then as the war goes on the union

1266
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:53,640
and then as the war goes on the union
 

1267
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,750
and then as the war goes on the union
will pass the conscription acts of 1862

1268
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:56,760
will pass the conscription acts of 1862

1271
00:22:59,039 --> 00:22:59,990
and 1863 which for the first time and
this is really important because it

1272
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:00,000
this is really important because it
 

1273
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,970
this is really important because it
creates new presidential powers for the

1274
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:01,980
creates new presidential powers for the
 

1275
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,770
creates new presidential powers for the
first time Lincoln will have

1276
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:03,780
first time Lincoln will have
 

1277
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,289
first time Lincoln will have
Presidential Power to force men into the

1278
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:06,299
Presidential Power to force men into the
 

1279
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:08,450
Presidential Power to force men into the
army which is what leads to all kinds of

1280
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:08,460
army which is what leads to all kinds of
 

1281
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,909
army which is what leads to all kinds of
draft riots in New York and elsewhere

1282

we're in Texas yeah yes so what's the

1306
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:38,400
we're in Texas yeah yes so what's the
 

1307
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,810
we're in Texas yeah yes so what's the
role of that uh in in this story the

1308
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:41,820
role of that uh in in this story the
 

1309
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,669
role of that uh in in this story the
American population is already armed

1310
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:43,679
American population is already armed
 

1311
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,870
American population is already armed
before the war

1312
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:44,880
before the war
 

1313
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,029
before the war
and so even though the union and the

1314
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:47,039
and so even though the union and the
 

1315
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,130
and so even though the union and the
Confederate armies will manufacture and

1316
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:49,140
Confederate armies will manufacture and
 

1317
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,169
Confederate armies will manufacture and
purchase arms it is already an armed

1318
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:51,179
purchase arms it is already an armed
 

1319
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,390
purchase arms it is already an armed
population so uh the American

1320
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:53,400
population so uh the American
 

1321
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,669
population so uh the American
presumption going into the war is that

1322
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:55,679
presumption going into the war is that
 

1323
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,070
presumption going into the war is that
citizens will not be forced to serve but

1324
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,080
citizens will not be forced to serve but
 

1325
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,630
citizens will not be forced to serve but
they will serve in militias to protect

1326
00:23:59,630 --> 00:23:59,640
they will serve in militias to protect
 

1327
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,370
they will serve in militias to protect
their own property and so the Second

1328
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:01,380
their own property and so the Second
 

1329
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,510
their own property and so the Second
Amendment the key part of the Second

1330
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:02,520
Amendment the key part of the Second
 

1331
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,070
Amendment the key part of the Second
Amendment for me as a historian is the

1332
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:04,080
Amendment for me as a historian is the
 

1333
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,930
Amendment for me as a historian is the
well-regulated militia part the

1334
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:05,940
well-regulated militia part the
 

1335
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,450
well-regulated militia part the
presumption that citizens as part of

1336
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:08,460
presumption that citizens as part of
 

1337
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,610
presumption that citizens as part of
their civic duty do not have a duty to

1338
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:10,620
their civic duty do not have a duty to
 

1339
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:14,210
their civic duty do not have a duty to
join a national Army Prussian style but

1340
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:14,220
join a national Army Prussian style but
 

1341
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,010
join a national Army Prussian style but
are supposed to be involved in defending

1343
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,330
are supposed to be involved in defending
their communities

1344
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:17,340
their communities
 

1345
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,549
their communities
uh and that's that's the reality it's

1346
00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:19,559
uh and that's that's the reality it's
 

1347
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,169
uh and that's that's the reality it's
also a bit of a myth

1348
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:21,179
also a bit of a myth
 

1349
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:23,510
also a bit of a myth
um and so Americans have have throughout

1350

00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,690
ownership has been for the purpose of
community self-defense the question

see like that because it's very
 

1393
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,029
see like that because it's very
difficult for that to get out of hand

1394
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:11,039
difficult for that to get out of hand
 

1395
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,549
difficult for that to get out of hand
right right okay there may be one guy in

in terms of the width of the vehicle
 

1401
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,789
in terms of the width of the vehicle
that you're using to operate

1405
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,690
um anyway that's that's a hilarious
discussion but starting to make the case

1406
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:23,700
discussion but starting to make the case
 

1407
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,090
discussion but starting to make the case
speaking of AK-47s and rifles and back

1408
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:26,100
speaking of AK-47s and rifles and back
 

1409
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,010
speaking of AK-47s and rifles and back
to Ukraine for a second one of the

1410
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:28,020
to Ukraine for a second one of the
 

1411
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,110
to Ukraine for a second one of the
fascinating social experiments that

1412
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:30,120
fascinating social experiments that
 

1413
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,330
fascinating social experiments that
happened in Ukraine at the beginning of

1414
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:32,340
happened in Ukraine at the beginning of
 

1415
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,029

everybody rifles and crime went down
 

1419
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:41,450
everybody rifles and crime went down
which I think is really interesting

1420
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:41,460
which I think is really interesting
 

1421
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,830
which I think is really interesting
yeah

1422
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:42,840

I hope somebody does a kind of

1424
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:45,059
I hope somebody does a kind of
 

1425
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:48,049
I hope somebody does a kind of
psychological data collection analysis

1426
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:48,059
psychological data collection analysis
 

1427
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:49,789
psychological data collection analysis
effort here to try to understand why

1428
00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:49,799
effort here to try to understand why
 

1429
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:53,450
effort here to try to understand why
because it's not obvious to me that in a

1430
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:53,460
because it's not obvious to me that in a
 

1431
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,090
because it's not obvious to me that in a
time of War if you give guns to the

1432
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:56,100
time of War if you give guns to the
 

1433
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,769
time of War if you give guns to the
entire populace anyone who wants a gun

1434
00:25:57,769 --> 00:25:57,779
entire populace anyone who wants a gun
 

1435
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:00,169
entire populace anyone who wants a gun
it's not going to especially in a

1436
00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:00,179
it's not going to especially in a
 

1437
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:01,789
it's not going to especially in a
country who has historically suffered

1438
00:26:01,789 --> 00:26:01,799

what do you think he was throughout his
life was there a deep

1596
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:08,220
life was there a deep
 

1597
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,190
life was there a deep
because that takes quite a vision like

1598
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:10,200
because that takes quite a vision like
 

1599
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,169
because that takes quite a vision like
you look at society today

1600
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:12,179
you look at society today
 

1601
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:15,890
you look at society today
and you it takes quite a man

1602
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:15,900
and you it takes quite a man
 

1603
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,950
and you it takes quite a man
to see that there's something deeply

1604
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:18,960
to see that there's something deeply
 

1605
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,450
to see that there's something deeply
broken where a lot of people take for

1606
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:20,460
broken where a lot of people take for
 

1607
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,669
broken where a lot of people take for
granted I mean in modern day you could

1608
00:29:22,669 --> 00:29:22,679
granted I mean in modern day you could
 

1609
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,230
granted I mean in modern day you could
see factory farming

1610
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:24,240
see factory farming
 

1611
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,029
see factory farming
is one of those things that in a hundred

1612
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:26,039
is one of those things that in a hundred
 

1613
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:28,250
is one of those things that in a hundred
years we might see is like the torture

1614
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:28,260
years we might see is like the torture
 

1615
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,870
years we might see is like the torture
of the mass torture of animals could be

1616
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:29,880
of the mass torture of animals could be
 

1617
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,690
of the mass torture of animals could be
uh could be seen as evil but just to

1618
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:32,700
uh could be seen as evil but just to
 

1619
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,310
uh could be seen as evil but just to
look around and wake up to that

1620
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:34,320
look around and wake up to that
 

1621
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,529
look around and wake up to that
especially in a leadership position uh

1622
00:29:36,529 --> 00:29:36,539
especially in a leadership position uh
 

1623
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:38,630
especially in a leadership position uh
yeah was he able to see that in some

1624
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:38,640
yeah was he able to see that in some
 

1625
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,070
yeah was he able to see that in some
ways yes in some ways no I mean the

1626
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,080
ways yes in some ways no I mean the
 

1627
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,570
ways yes in some ways no I mean the
premise of your question is really

1628
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:41,580
premise of your question is really
 

1629
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,190
premise of your question is really
important that

1630
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:43,200
important that
 

1631
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,409
important that
um to us it's obvious that slavery is is

1632
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:45,419
um to us it's obvious that slavery is is
 

1633
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:47,990
um to us it's obvious that slavery is is
a horror but to those who had grown up

1634
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,000
a horror but to those who had grown up
 

1635
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,630
a horror but to those who had grown up
with it who had grown up seeing that it

1636
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:50,640
with it who had grown up seeing that it
 

1637
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,610
with it who had grown up seeing that it
was hard to imagine a different world so

1638
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:52,620
was hard to imagine a different world so
 

1639
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,130
was hard to imagine a different world so
you're right Lincoln's imagination like

1640
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:55,140
you're right Lincoln's imagination like
 

1641
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,130
you're right Lincoln's imagination like
everyone else's was limited by his time

1642
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:57,140
everyone else's was limited by his time
 

1643
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,630
everyone else's was limited by his time
I don't think Lincoln imagined a world

1644
00:29:59,630 --> 00:29:59,640
I don't think Lincoln imagined a world
 

1645
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,149
I don't think Lincoln imagined a world
of equality between the races but he had

1646
00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:02,159
of equality between the races but he had
 

1647
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,389
of equality between the races but he had
come to see that slavery uh was horrible

1648
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:05,399
come to see that slavery uh was horrible
 

1649
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:07,490
come to see that slavery uh was horrible
and historians have differed in in how

1650
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:07,500
and historians have differed in in how
 

1651
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,870
and historians have differed in in how
he came to this uh part of it is that uh

1652
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:11,880
he came to this uh part of it is that uh
 

1653
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,490
he came to this uh part of it is that uh
he had a father who treated him like a

1654
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:13,500
he had a father who treated him like a
 

1655
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,330
he had a father who treated him like a
slave

1656
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:14,340
slave
 

1657
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,010
slave
and you can see in his early

1658
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:16,020
and you can see in his early
 

1659
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,810
and you can see in his early
correspondence how much he hates that

1660
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:17,820
correspondence how much he hates that
 

1661
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,430
correspondence how much he hates that
his father who is a struggling farmer

1662
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:19,440
his father who is a struggling farmer
 

1663
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,169
his father who is a struggling farmer
was basically trying to control

1664
00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:21,179
was basically trying to control
 

1665
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:22,549
was basically trying to control
Lincoln's life

1666
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:22,559
Lincoln's life
 

1667
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,789
Lincoln's life
and he came to understand personally I

1668
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:25,799
and he came to understand personally I
 

1669
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:27,230
and he came to understand personally I
think how horrible it is to have someone

1670
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:27,240
think how horrible it is to have someone
 

1671
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,549
think how horrible it is to have someone
else tell you what you should do with

your labor not giving you your own your
 

1675
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,830
your labor not giving you your own your
own choices but Lincoln was also a

1676
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:33,840
own choices but Lincoln was also a
 

1677
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,330
own choices but Lincoln was also a
pragmatist this is what made him a great

1678
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:35,340
pragmatist this is what made him a great
 

1679
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,250
pragmatist this is what made him a great
politician he wanted to work through

politician he wanted to work through
 

1681
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,529
politician he wanted to work through
institutions not to burn them down

institutions not to burn them down
 

1683
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:43,549
institutions not to burn them down
and he famously said that uh if he could

and he famously said that uh if he could
 

1685
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:46,250
and he famously said that uh if he could
preserve the union and stop the spread

00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:46,260
preserve the union and stop the spread
 

1687
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,350
preserve the union and stop the spread
of slavery by allowing slavery to stay

1688
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:48,360
of slavery by allowing slavery to stay
 

1689
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,029
of slavery by allowing slavery to stay
in the South he would if he could do it

in the South he would if he could do it
 

1691
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,470
in the South he would if he could do it
by eliminating slavery in the South he

1692
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:51,480
by eliminating slavery in the South he
 

1693
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,730
by eliminating slavery in the South he

1695
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,289
would if he could do it by buying the
slaves and sending them somewhere else

1696
00:30:54,289 --> 00:30:54,299
slaves and sending them somewhere else
 

1697

00:30:57,649 --> 00:30:57,659
he would his main goal what he ran on
 

1699
00:30:57,659 --> 00:30:59,810
he would his main goal what he ran on
was that the new territories west of

1700
00:30:59,810 --> 00:30:59,820
was that the new territories west of
 

1701
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,909
was that the new territories west of
Illinois that they would be areas for

1702
00:31:01,909 --> 00:31:01,919
Illinois that they would be areas for
 

1703
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:07,970
Illinois that they would be areas for
free poor white men like him not slavery

1704
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:07,980

 

1705
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,889

what do you learn about human nature if

1706
00:31:09,889 --> 00:31:09,899
what do you learn about human nature if
 

1707
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:11,210
what do you learn about human nature if
you step back and look at the big

1708
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:11,220
you step back and look at the big
 

1709
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,310
you step back and look at the big
picture of it that slavey has been a

1710
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:13,320
picture of it that slavey has been a
 

1711
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,110
picture of it that slavey has been a
part of human civilization for thousands

1712
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:15,120
part of human civilization for thousands
 

1713
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,590
part of human civilization for thousands
of years that this American slavery is

1714
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:18,600
of years that this American slavery is
 

1715
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,529
of years that this American slavery is
not a new phenomenon

1716
00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:21,539
not a new phenomenon
 

1717
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:23,269
not a new phenomenon
I think history teaches us a very

1718
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:23,279
I think history teaches us a very
 

1719
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,310
I think history teaches us a very
pessimistic and a very optimistic lesson

1720
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:25,320
pessimistic and a very optimistic lesson
 

1721
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,169
pessimistic and a very optimistic lesson
the pessimistic lesson is that human

1722
00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:27,179
the pessimistic lesson is that human
 

1723
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:29,510
the pessimistic lesson is that human
beings are capable of doing enormous

1724
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:29,520
beings are capable of doing enormous
 

1725
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,630
beings are capable of doing enormous
harm and brutality to their fellow man

1726
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:32,640
harm and brutality to their fellow man
 

1727
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,149
harm and brutality to their fellow man
and woman and we see that with genocide

00:31:35,149 --> 00:31:35,159
and woman and we see that with genocide
 

1729
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:36,409
and woman and we see that with genocide
in our world today

00:31:36,409 --> 00:31:36,419
in our world today

in our world today
dead human beings are capable with the

00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:49,020
is in the same category right
 

1739
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,830
is in the same category right
uh the optimistic side

1740
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:51,840
uh the optimistic side
 

1741
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,630
uh the optimistic side
is that human beings are also capable

1742
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:53,640
is that human beings are also capable

of putting those energies into
productive uses for other people but I

productive uses for other people but I
don't think that comes naturally I think

can have from a game theory perspective
 

1807
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,409
can have from a game theory perspective
uh benefits but I don't think that's

so it's like animal farm all animals are

1894
00:34:58,730 --> 00:34:58,740
so it's like animal farm all animals are
 

1895
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,109
so it's like animal farm all animals are
equal but some are more equal than

1896
00:35:00,109 --> 00:35:00,119
equal but some are more equal than
 

1897
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:02,089
equal but some are more equal than
others that's right and I think that's

1898
00:35:02,089 --> 00:35:02,099
others that's right and I think that's
 

1899
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:03,589
others that's right and I think that's
that's still the way people view things

1900
00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:03,599
that's still the way people view things
 

1901
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,650
that's still the way people view things
yeah right I don't know if that's a

1902
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:06,660
yeah right I don't know if that's a
 

1903
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,329
yeah right I don't know if that's a
that's a liberal position or it's just a

1904
00:35:08,329 --> 00:35:08,339
that's a liberal position or it's just a
 

1905
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:10,370
that's a liberal position or it's just a
human position that um

1906
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:10,380
human position that um
 

1907
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,550
human position that um
that all humans have equal value

1908
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:13,560
that all humans have equal value
 

1909
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,069
that all humans have equal value

the last few decades I think is it
 

2669
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,170
the last few decades I think is it
hasn't been clear what the rules are in

00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:34,920
public opinion about that is going to go
 

2701
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,230
public opinion about that is going to go
go wild

2702
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:36,240
go wild
 

2703
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,809
go wild
and uh I think that's okay for the New

2704
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:38,819
and uh I think that's okay for the New
 

2705
00:49:38,819 --> 00:49:40,730
and uh I think that's okay for the New
York Times people can in a collective

2706
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:40,740
York Times people can in a collective
 

2707
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,069
York Times people can in a collective
way figure stuff out like they could say

2708
00:49:43,069 --> 00:49:43,079
way figure stuff out like they could say
 

2709
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:47,210
way figure stuff out like they could say
okay New York Times uh 73 of the time is

2710
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:47,220
okay New York Times uh 73 of the time is
 

2711

okay New York Times uh 73 of the time is
gonna lean left in their head they have

2712
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:49,140
gonna lean left in their head they have
 

2713
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:51,650
gonna lean left in their head they have
like a loose estimation or whatever uh

2714
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:51,660
like a loose estimation or whatever uh
 

2715
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:54,230
like a loose estimation or whatever uh
but for a platform like Twitter it seems

2716
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:54,240
but for a platform like Twitter it seems
 

2717
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,170
but for a platform like Twitter it seems
like they're it's more complicated now

2718
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:57,180
like they're it's more complicated now
 

2719
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:58,370
like they're it's more complicated now
of course there should be rules of the

2720
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:58,380
of course there should be rules of the
 

2721
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:00,530
of course there should be rules of the
game but I think there's um

2722
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:00,540
game but I think there's um
 

2723
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,170
game but I think there's um
maybe I want to say a responsibility to

2724
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:03,180
maybe I want to say a responsibility to
 

2725
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:07,010
maybe I want to say a responsibility to
also create incentives for people to do

2726
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:07,020
also create incentives for people to do
 

2727
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:10,069
also create incentives for people to do
High effort empathetic debate

2728
00:50:10,069 --> 00:50:10,079
High effort empathetic debate
 

2729
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:13,010

versus throwing poop at each other yeah

2730
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:13,020
versus throwing poop at each other yeah
 

2731
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,870
versus throwing poop at each other yeah
I think those are two slightly different

2732
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:14,880
I think those are two slightly different
 

2733
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,370
I think those are two slightly different
things so I agree

2734
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:16,380
things so I agree
 

2735
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,190
things so I agree
I think that my view is that the failure

2736
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:19,200
I think that my view is that the failure
 

2737
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,930
I think that my view is that the failure
of Facebook and Twitter and others and

2738
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:20,940
of Facebook and Twitter and others and
 

2739
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:23,450
of Facebook and Twitter and others and
in recent years has been that they have

2740
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:23,460
in recent years has been that they have
 

2741
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,309
in recent years has been that they have
been completely untransparent about

2742
00:50:25,309 --> 00:50:25,319
been completely untransparent about
 

2743
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:28,190
been completely untransparent about
their rules so what I would think would

2744
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:28,200
their rules so what I would think would
 

2745
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,809
their rules so what I would think would
make would Advance us

2746
00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:29,819
make would Advance us
 

2747
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:32,450
make would Advance us
is if they had a set of rules that were

2748
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:32,460
is if they had a set of rules that were
 

2749
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:34,190
is if they had a set of rules that were
clear that were consistently followed

2750
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:34,200
clear that were consistently followed
 

2751
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,589
clear that were consistently followed
and we understood what they were

2752
00:50:36,589 --> 00:50:36,599
and we understood what they were
 

2753
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:39,470
and we understood what they were
that would also tell us as consumers

2754
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:39,480
that would also tell us as consumers
 

2755
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,349
that would also tell us as consumers
how much what the biases are how to

how much what the biases are how to
 

2757
00:50:42,359 --> 00:50:43,910
how much what the biases are how to
understand what's going on it seems like

I might say that since Elon Musk is

2760
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:45,540
I might say that since Elon Musk is
 

2761
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,089
I might say that since Elon Musk is
taken over Twitter it's been arbitrary

2762
00:50:47,089 --> 00:50:47,099
taken over Twitter it's been arbitrary
 

2763
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:48,410
taken over Twitter it's been arbitrary
and who's thrown off and who's not

00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:48,420
and who's thrown off and who's not
 

2765
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,450
and who's thrown off and who's not
thrown off who's and that's that's a

2766
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:50,460
thrown off who's and that's that's a
 

2767
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,309
thrown off who's and that's that's a
real problem arbitrariness is in some

2768
00:50:52,309 --> 00:50:52,319
real problem arbitrariness is in some
 

2769
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:54,530
real problem arbitrariness is in some
ways the opposite of democracy but

2770
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:54,540
ways the opposite of democracy but
 

2771
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:57,710
ways the opposite of democracy but
there's also a hidden arbitrariness

2772
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:57,720
there's also a hidden arbitrariness
 

2773
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,390
there's also a hidden arbitrariness
in uh

2774
00:50:59,390 --> 00:50:59,400
in uh
 

2775
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,430
in uh
interpretation of the rules so for

2776
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:01,440
interpretation of the rules so for
 

2777
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,450
interpretation of the rules so for
example

2778
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:02,460
example
 

2779
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,510
example
what comment incites violence

2780
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:05,520
what comment incites violence
 

2781
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,250
what comment incites violence
that's really really difficult to figure

2782
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:07,260
that's really really difficult to figure
 

2783
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:08,770
that's really really difficult to figure
out to me like there's a gray area

2784
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:08,780
out to me like there's a gray area
 

2785
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:11,450
out to me like there's a gray area
obviously there's very clear versions of

00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:11,460
obviously there's very clear versions of
 

2787
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:14,030
obviously there's very clear versions of
that but if I know anything about people

2788
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:14,040
that but if I know anything about people
 

2789
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,130
that but if I know anything about people
that try to incite violence they're

2790
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:16,140
that try to incite violence they're
 

2791
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,230

2845
00:52:11,819 --> 00:52:14,329
there's a lot of other stuff where it's
a gray area but we could start

2846
00:52:14,329 --> 00:52:14,339
a gray area but we could start
 

2847
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:16,730
a gray area but we could start
if we're applying these rules

2848
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:16,740
if we're applying these rules
 

2849
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:18,950
if we're applying these rules
yes by getting that material off of

2850
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:18,960
yes by getting that material off of
 

2851
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,410
yes by getting that material off of
these sites so some of that is a problem

2852
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:21,420
these sites so some of that is a problem
 

2853
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:23,630
these sites so some of that is a problem
of scale too but the gray area is still

2854
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:23,640
of scale too but the gray area is still
 

2855
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,450
of scale too but the gray area is still
a forever problem that we may never be

2856
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:26,460
a forever problem that we may never be
 

2857
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:28,730
a forever problem that we may never be
able to solve and maybe the tension

00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:28,740
able to solve and maybe the tension
 

2859
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:31,010
able to solve and maybe the tension
within the gray area is the very process

2860
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:31,020
within the gray area is the very process
 

2861
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:33,230
within the gray area is the very process
of democracy but saying like we need to

2862
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:33,240
of democracy but saying like we need to
 

2863
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,970
of democracy but saying like we need to
take our country back

today in the 21st century is uh one how
 

3521
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:52,609
today in the 21st century is uh one how
much of that is still there and how much

3522
01:04:52,609 --> 01:04:52,619
much of that is still there and how much
 

3523
01:04:52,619 --> 01:04:54,829

through the institutions and I'm making
 

3527
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,130
through the institutions and I'm making
the latter point that it's not there

3528
01:04:58,130 --> 01:04:58,140
the latter point that it's not there
 

3529
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:00,589
the latter point that it's not there
that much now but people remember it

that much now but people remember it
 

3531
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:02,990
that much now but people remember it
well and some people would even say it's

3532
01:05:02,990 --> 01:05:03,000
well and some people would even say it's
 

3533
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,030

uh but if if that's the case then you
 

3539
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:13,490
uh but if if that's the case then you
can also say that if there is not direct

3540
01:05:13,490 --> 01:05:13,500

4094
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:26,340
to that war there's a very distinctive
 

4095
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:28,910
to that war there's a very distinctive
clear end to that war and you also uh

4096
01:15:28,910 --> 01:15:28,920
clear end to that war and you also uh
 

4097
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:31,370
clear end to that war and you also uh
make the case that World War II is not a

4098
01:15:31,370 --> 01:15:31,380
make the case that World War II is not a
 

4099
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:34,610
make the case that World War II is not a
good example not a good model of a war

4100
01:15:34,610 --> 01:15:34,620
good example not a good model of a war
 

4101
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:37,490
good example not a good model of a war
to help us analyze history it's given

4102
01:15:37,490 --> 01:15:37,500
to help us analyze history it's given
 

4103
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,229
to help us analyze history it's given
Americans the wrong idea what war is

4104
01:15:39,229 --> 01:15:39,239
Americans the wrong idea what war is
 

4105
01:15:39,239 --> 01:15:41,270
Americans the wrong idea what war is
because World War II ends as most wars

4106
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:41,280
because World War II ends as most wars
 

4107
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:42,590
because World War II ends as most wars
don't end World War II ends with a

4108
01:15:42,590 --> 01:15:42,600
don't end World War II ends with a
 

4109
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:43,910
don't end World War II ends with a
complete defeat

4110
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:43,920
complete defeat
 

4111
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,950
complete defeat
of the German Army and the German

4112
01:15:45,950 --> 01:15:45,960
of the German Army and the German
 

4113
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:48,169
of the German Army and the German
society and the near complete defeat of

4114
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:48,179
society and the near complete defeat of
 

4115
01:15:48,179 --> 01:15:49,070
society and the near complete defeat of
Japan

4116
01:15:49,070 --> 01:15:49,080
Japan
 

4117
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:51,530
Japan
and where both sides in different ways

4118
01:15:51,530 --> 01:15:51,540
and where both sides in different ways
 

4119
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:53,689
and where both sides in different ways
except defeat

4120
01:15:53,689 --> 01:15:53,699
except defeat
 

4121
01:15:53,699 --> 01:15:55,550
except defeat
what I'm pointing out in the book is

4122
01:15:55,550 --> 01:15:55,560
what I'm pointing out in the book is
 

4123
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:57,110
what I'm pointing out in the book is
that most wars don't accept with one

4124
01:15:57,110 --> 01:15:57,120
that most wars don't accept with one
 

4125
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,910
that most wars don't accept with one
side don't end with one side accepting

4126
01:15:58,910 --> 01:15:58,920
side don't end with one side accepting
 

4127
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:01,550
side don't end with one side accepting
defeat and uh generally the war

4128
01:16:01,550 --> 01:16:01,560
defeat and uh generally the war
 

4129
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,229
defeat and uh generally the war
continues after the battles and this is

4130
01:16:03,229 --> 01:16:03,239
continues after the battles and this is
 

4131
01:16:03,239 --> 01:16:04,370
continues after the battles and this is
something that's hard for Americans to

4132
01:16:04,370 --> 01:16:04,380
something that's hard for Americans to
 

4133
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:05,930
something that's hard for Americans to
understand our system is built with the

4134
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:05,940
understand our system is built with the
 

4135
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:07,430
understand our system is built with the
presumption when War is Over when we

4136
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:07,440
presumption when War is Over when we
 

4137
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,530
presumption when War is Over when we
sign a piece of paper everyone can go

4138
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:09,540
sign a piece of paper everyone can go
 

4139
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:10,610
sign a piece of paper everyone can go
home

4140
01:16:10,610 --> 01:16:10,620
home
 

4141
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:12,890
home
that's not what happens I mean Civil War

4142
01:16:12,890 --> 01:16:12,900
that's not what happens I mean Civil War
 

4143
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:15,950
that's not what happens I mean Civil War
is a special case it's especially a

4144
01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:15,960
is a special case it's especially a
 

4145
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:17,930
is a special case it's especially a
strong case of that because the people

4146
01:16:17,930 --> 01:16:17,940
strong case of that because the people
 

4147
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:19,490
strong case of that because the people
that fought the War is still living in

4148
01:16:19,490 --> 01:16:19,500
that fought the War is still living in
 

4149
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,590
that fought the War is still living in
that land that's exactly right and in

4150
01:16:21,590 --> 01:16:21,600
that land that's exactly right and in
 

4151
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,330
that land that's exactly right and in
this case some of them are leaders also

4152
01:16:23,330 --> 01:16:23,340
this case some of them are leaders also
 

4153
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:25,370
this case some of them are leaders also
many of them become the leaders of the

4154
01:16:25,370 --> 01:16:25,380
many of them become the leaders of the
 

4155
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:26,950
many of them become the leaders of the
very areas that they were leading before

4156
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:26,960
very areas that they were leading before
 

4157
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,330
very areas that they were leading before
uh and I think that's another lesson

4158
01:16:29,330 --> 01:16:29,340
uh and I think that's another lesson
 

4159
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:32,149
uh and I think that's another lesson
here too that we did undertake after

4160
01:16:32,149 --> 01:16:32,159
here too that we did undertake after
 

4161
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:34,070
here too that we did undertake after
World War II though in a flawed way we

4162
01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:34,080
World War II though in a flawed way we
 

4163
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:36,890
World War II though in a flawed way we
had a Nuremberg system we did prohibit

4164
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:36,900
had a Nuremberg system we did prohibit
 

4165
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:38,750
had a Nuremberg system we did prohibit
at least Nazi leaders from coming back

4166
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:38,760
at least Nazi leaders from coming back
 

4167
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,370
at least Nazi leaders from coming back
into power we made an exception for the

4168
01:16:40,370 --> 01:16:40,380
into power we made an exception for the
 

4169
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:42,050
into power we made an exception for the
emperor in Japan but we generally

4170
01:16:42,050 --> 01:16:42,060
emperor in Japan but we generally
 

4171
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:43,669
emperor in Japan but we generally
followed the same rule uh in Japan

4172
01:16:43,669 --> 01:16:43,679
followed the same rule uh in Japan
 

4173
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:45,770
followed the same rule uh in Japan
whereas in the United States

4174
01:16:45,770 --> 01:16:45,780
whereas in the United States
 

4175
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:48,050
whereas in the United States
as I point out many of the leaders of

4176
01:16:48,050 --> 01:16:48,060
as I point out many of the leaders of
 

4177
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:49,370
as I point out many of the leaders of
the Confederacy first of all don't

4178
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:49,380
the Confederacy first of all don't
 

4179
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:52,070
the Confederacy first of all don't
surrender they flee to Mexico

4180
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:52,080
surrender they flee to Mexico
 

4181
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,930
surrender they flee to Mexico
then they come back after they lose in

4182
01:16:53,930 --> 01:16:53,940
then they come back after they lose in
 

4183
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:56,149
then they come back after they lose in
Mexico a second time they come back to

4184
01:16:56,149 --> 01:16:56,159
Mexico a second time they come back to
 

4185
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:57,350
Mexico a second time they come back to
the United States and they get elected

01:17:00,830 --> 01:17:00,840
uh the guy who writes the election laws
 

4191
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:03,410
uh the guy who writes the election laws
in Texas Alexander Watkins Terrell most

4192
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:03,420
in Texas Alexander Watkins Terrell most
 

4193
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:05,390
in Texas Alexander Watkins Terrell most
people don't know this even in Texas he

4194
01:17:05,390 --> 01:17:05,400
people don't know this even in Texas he
 

4195
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,550
people don't know this even in Texas he
was a confederate general fled to Mexico

4196

was a confederate general fled to Mexico
 

4197
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:09,530
was a confederate general fled to Mexico

Army of Maximilian emperor of Mexico who
was put in power by Louis Napoleon after

was put in power by Louis Napoleon after
Max Millions defeated Alexander Watkins

4204
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:16,860
Max Millions defeated Alexander Watkins
 

4205
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:19,130
Max Millions defeated Alexander Watkins
Terrell comes back to Texas runs for the

4206
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:19,140
Terrell comes back to Texas runs for the
 

4207
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:21,350
Terrell comes back to Texas runs for the
state legislature and then writes the

4208
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:21,360
state legislature and then writes the
 

4209
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,870
state legislature and then writes the
election laws it's crazy can you make

4210
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:23,880
election laws it's crazy can you make
 

4211
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:25,850
election laws it's crazy can you make
the case for that that that's a feature

4212
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:25,860
the case for that that that's a feature
 

4213
01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:27,770
the case for that that that's a feature
of the American system not a bug that

4214
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:27,780
of the American system not a bug that
 

4215
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:29,450
of the American system not a bug that
that is an implementation of justice

4216
01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:29,460
that is an implementation of justice
 

4217
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:31,970
that is an implementation of justice
that you forgive that you don't

4218
01:17:31,970 --> 01:17:31,980
that you forgive that you don't
 

4219
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:34,850
that you forgive that you don't
persecute everybody on the other side of

4220
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:34,860
persecute everybody on the other side of
 

4221
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:37,310
persecute everybody on the other side of
the war maybe and I think that's a good

4222
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:37,320
the war maybe and I think that's a good
 

4223
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,470
the war maybe and I think that's a good
feature in terms of lower level

4224
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:39,480
feature in terms of lower level
 

4225
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:41,510
feature in terms of lower level
individuals but I think a bad feature of

4226
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:41,520
individuals but I think a bad feature of
 

4227
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:45,470
individuals but I think a bad feature of
our system is we do allow

4228
01:17:45,470 --> 01:17:45,480
our system is we do allow
 

4229
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:47,270
our system is we do allow
elite figures who have committed

4230
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:47,280
elite figures who have committed
 

4231
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,070
elite figures who have committed
wrongdoing we give them many ways to get

4232
01:17:49,070 --> 01:17:49,080
wrongdoing we give them many ways to get
 

4233
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,229
wrongdoing we give them many ways to get
out of punishment you are more likely to

4234
01:17:51,229 --> 01:17:51,239
out of punishment you are more likely to
 

4235
01:17:51,239 --> 01:17:53,149
out of punishment you are more likely to
be punished in this Society if you do

4236
01:17:53,149 --> 01:17:53,159
be punished in this Society if you do
 

4237
01:17:53,159 --> 01:17:55,310
be punished in this Society if you do
something wrong and you're not an elite

4238
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:55,320
something wrong and you're not an elite
 

4239
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:57,350
something wrong and you're not an elite
figure then if you're on a leader there

4240
01:17:57,350 --> 01:17:57,360
figure then if you're on a leader there
 

4241
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:58,490
figure then if you're on a leader there
should be a proportional like

4242
01:17:58,490 --> 01:17:58,500
should be a proportional like
 

4243
01:17:58,500 --> 01:17:59,810
should be a proportional like
forgiveness should be equally

4244
01:17:59,810 --> 01:17:59,820
forgiveness should be equally
 

4245
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:02,030
forgiveness should be equally
distributed across and it's not yeah and

4246
01:18:02,030 --> 01:18:02,040
distributed across and it's not yeah and
 

4247
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:03,470
distributed across and it's not yeah and
it's not

4248
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:03,480
it's not
 

4249
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:05,930
it's not
but we could change it we could fix that

4250
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:05,940

brother but he's a troll so uh so
there's a feature on the past on

4822
01:28:25,189 --> 01:28:25,199
there's a feature on the past on
 

4823
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:26,930
there's a feature on the past on
whatever password manager I may or may

4824

whatever password manager I may or may
 

4825
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:28,910
whatever password manager I may or may
not use uh and this is there's a bunch

4826
01:28:28,910 --> 01:28:28,920
not use uh and this is there's a bunch
 

4827
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:30,830
not use uh and this is there's a bunch
of services like this it's interesting I

4828
01:28:30,830 --> 01:28:30,840
of services like this it's interesting I
 

4829
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:32,689
of services like this it's interesting I
don't know if you you know about I've

4830
01:28:32,689 --> 01:28:32,699
don't know if you you know about I've
 

4831
01:28:32,699 --> 01:28:36,850
don't know if you you know about I've
learned about all this uh is you can

4832
01:28:36,850 --> 01:28:36,860
learned about all this uh is you can
 

4833
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:40,370
learned about all this uh is you can
have them request access and it's going

4834
01:28:40,370 --> 01:28:40,380
have them request access and it's going
 

4835
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:41,870
have them request access and it's going
to wait 30 days before it gives them

4836
01:28:41,870 --> 01:28:41,880
to wait 30 days before it gives them
 

4837
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:44,990
to wait 30 days before it gives them
access so it's kind of has this um

4838
01:28:44,990 --> 01:28:45,000
access so it's kind of has this um
 

4839
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:49,550
access so it's kind of has this um
built-in trust okay uh trust padding uh

4840
01:28:49,550 --> 01:28:49,560
built-in trust okay uh trust padding uh
 

4841
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:51,050
built-in trust okay uh trust padding uh
but it's interesting I mean to me on

4842
01:28:51,050 --> 01:28:51,060
but it's interesting I mean to me on
 

4843
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:52,970
but it's interesting I mean to me on
that aspect is just to have a plan in

unless you can devise
 

4867
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:17,270
unless you can devise
a technical solution like that you have

4868
01:29:17,270 --> 01:29:17,280
a technical solution like that you have
 

4869
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:19,490
a technical solution like that you have
to give someone power now yeah and

4875
01:29:23,639 --> 01:29:25,010
democracy is a kind of Technology you
kind of have to figure out how to do it

4876
01:29:25,010 --> 01:29:25,020
kind of have to figure out how to do it
 

4877
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:26,810
kind of have to figure out how to do it
correctly how to have how to have that

4878
01:29:26,810 --> 01:29:26,820
correctly how to have how to have that
 

4879
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:28,669
correctly how to have how to have that
power propagate and especially during

4880
01:29:28,669 --> 01:29:28,679
power propagate and especially during
 

4881
01:29:28,679 --> 01:29:31,910
power propagate and especially during
war how you get everybody together into

4882
01:29:31,910 --> 01:29:31,920
war how you get everybody together into
 

4883
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:35,030
war how you get everybody together into
this war-mongering mood or and then how

4884
01:29:35,030 --> 01:29:35,040
this war-mongering mood or and then how
 

4885
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:37,310
this war-mongering mood or and then how
do you how do you like come come down

4886
01:29:37,310 --> 01:29:37,320
do you how do you like come come down
 

4887
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:40,430
do you how do you like come come down
from that and just relax precisely so in

4888
01:29:40,430 --> 01:29:40,440
from that and just relax precisely so in
 

4889
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:42,169
from that and just relax precisely so in
some sense that's

4890
01:29:42,169 --> 01:29:42,179
some sense that's
 

4891
01:29:42,179 --> 01:29:44,030
some sense that's
well there Johnson that was the the

4892
01:29:44,030 --> 01:29:44,040
well there Johnson that was the the
 

4893
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:46,490
well there Johnson that was the the
problem is is the over centralization of

4894
01:29:46,490 --> 01:29:46,500
problem is is the over centralization of
 

4895
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:48,350
problem is is the over centralization of
power it was the over centralization of

4896
01:29:48,350 --> 01:29:48,360
power it was the over centralization of
 

4897
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:51,370
power it was the over centralization of
power but it was also that Lincoln

4898
01:29:51,370 --> 01:29:51,380
power but it was also that Lincoln
 

4899
01:29:51,380 --> 01:29:54,950
power but it was also that Lincoln
had a designated successor who was going

4900
01:29:54,950 --> 01:29:54,960
had a designated successor who was going
 

4901
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,689
had a designated successor who was going
to do and tried to do everything that

4902
01:29:56,689 --> 01:29:56,699
to do and tried to do everything that
 

4903
01:29:56,699 --> 01:29:58,790
to do and tried to do everything that
ran against what Lincoln was doing and

4904
01:29:58,790 --> 01:29:58,800
ran against what Lincoln was doing and
 

4905
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,709
ran against what Lincoln was doing and
it set the country back we went forward

4906
01:30:00,709 --> 01:30:00,719
it set the country back we went forward
 

4907
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:02,390
it set the country back we went forward
at the end of the Civil War and then we

4908
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:02,400
at the end of the Civil War and then we
 

4909
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,709
at the end of the Civil War and then we
went backward

4910
01:30:03,709 --> 01:30:03,719
went backward
 

4911
01:30:03,719 --> 01:30:05,629
went backward
more so than we would have if there had

4912
01:30:05,629 --> 01:30:05,639
more so than we would have if there had
 

4913
01:30:05,639 --> 01:30:07,850
more so than we would have if there had
been a new election because if there had

4914
01:30:07,850 --> 01:30:07,860
been a new election because if there had
 

4915
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:09,290
been a new election because if there had
been a new election there still would be

4916
01:30:09,290 --> 01:30:09,300
been a new election there still would be
 

4917
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:11,209
been a new election there still would be
reason for that person running even if

4918
01:30:11,209 --> 01:30:11,219
reason for that person running even if
 

4919
01:30:11,219 --> 01:30:12,530
reason for that person running even if
they were on the other side to try to

4920
01:30:12,530 --> 01:30:12,540
they were on the other side to try to
 

4921
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:14,689
they were on the other side to try to
find some compromise positions Andrew

4922
01:30:14,689 --> 01:30:14,699
find some compromise positions Andrew
 

4923
01:30:14,699 --> 01:30:16,729
find some compromise positions Andrew
Johnson inherited power

4924
01:30:16,729 --> 01:30:16,739
Johnson inherited power
 

4925
01:30:16,739 --> 01:30:19,129
Johnson inherited power
with very few limitations on how he used

4926
01:30:19,129 --> 01:30:19,139
with very few limitations on how he used
 

4927
01:30:19,139 --> 01:30:20,689
with very few limitations on how he used
that power Congress wasn't even in

4928
01:30:20,689 --> 01:30:20,699
that power Congress wasn't even in
 

4929
01:30:20,699 --> 01:30:21,770
that power Congress wasn't even in
session

4930
01:30:21,770 --> 01:30:21,780
session
 

4931
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:23,689
session
and so this became very directly a

4932
01:30:23,689 --> 01:30:23,699
and so this became very directly a
 

4933
01:30:23,699 --> 01:30:25,370
and so this became very directly a
problem because Andrew Johnson started

4934
01:30:25,370 --> 01:30:25,380
problem because Andrew Johnson started
 

4935
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:26,990
problem because Andrew Johnson started
pardoning Southerners allowing them to

4936
01:30:26,990 --> 01:30:27,000
pardoning Southerners allowing them to
 

4937
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,310
pardoning Southerners allowing them to
come back into power

4938
01:30:28,310 --> 01:30:28,320
come back into power
 

4939
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:30,169
come back into power
so we had like a few months where he

4940
01:30:30,169 --> 01:30:30,179
so we had like a few months where he
 

4941
01:30:30,179 --> 01:30:32,090
so we had like a few months where he
just went wild yeah

4942
01:30:32,090 --> 01:30:32,100
just went wild yeah
 

4943
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:34,310
just went wild yeah
it's it's giving the car keys to someone

4944
01:30:34,310 --> 01:30:34,320
it's it's giving the car keys to someone
 

4945
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:36,229
it's it's giving the car keys to someone
who's not prepared to drive but decided

4946
01:30:36,229 --> 01:30:36,239
who's not prepared to drive but decided
 

4947
01:30:36,239 --> 01:30:37,250
who's not prepared to drive but decided
that they're going to do what they want

4948
01:30:37,250 --> 01:30:37,260
that they're going to do what they want
 

4949
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:39,290
that they're going to do what they want
with the car for a while

4950
01:30:39,290 --> 01:30:39,300
with the car for a while
 

4951
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:41,450
with the car for a while
all right

4952
01:30:41,450 --> 01:30:41,460
all right
 

4953
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:43,610
all right
is there any level to which power

4954
01:30:43,610 --> 01:30:43,620
is there any level to which power
 

4955
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:47,330
is there any level to which power
corrupted Lincoln a war president yes I

4956
01:30:47,330 --> 01:30:47,340
corrupted Lincoln a war president yes I
 

4957
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:48,890
corrupted Lincoln a war president yes I
do think there are some areas and I

4958
01:30:48,890 --> 01:30:48,900
do think there are some areas and I
 

4959
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:51,050
do think there are some areas and I
think that even though he was a great

4960
01:30:51,050 --> 01:30:51,060
think that even though he was a great
 

4961
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:52,370
think that even though he was a great
president if not our greatest president

4962
01:30:52,370 --> 01:30:52,380
president if not our greatest president
 

4963
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:54,830
president if not our greatest president
maybe one of the greatest figures of the

4964
01:30:54,830 --> 01:30:54,840
maybe one of the greatest figures of the
 

4965
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,510
maybe one of the greatest figures of the
of our history

4966
01:30:56,510 --> 01:30:56,520
of our history
 

4967
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:58,669
of our history
um he was flawed uh one is his problem

4968
01:30:58,669 --> 01:30:58,679
um he was flawed uh one is his problem
 

4969
01:30:58,679 --> 01:31:01,070
um he was flawed uh one is his problem
of succession but also

4970
01:31:01,070 --> 01:31:01,080
of succession but also
 

4971
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:04,970
of succession but also
I think Lincoln uh over invested in the

4972
01:31:04,970 --> 01:31:04,980
I think Lincoln uh over invested in the
 

4973
01:31:04,980 --> 01:31:06,470
I think Lincoln uh over invested in the
power of the presidency he came to

4974
01:31:06,470 --> 01:31:06,480
power of the presidency he came to
 

4975
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,270
power of the presidency he came to
believe too much

4976
01:31:08,270 --> 01:31:08,280
believe too much
 

4977
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:10,390
believe too much
in the role of one man

4978
01:31:10,390 --> 01:31:10,400
in the role of one man
 

4979
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:14,810
in the role of one man
and not in creating a more balanced

4980
01:31:14,810 --> 01:31:14,820
and not in creating a more balanced
 

4981
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:16,129
and not in creating a more balanced
approach to governance and that's a

4982
01:31:16,129 --> 01:31:16,139
approach to governance and that's a
 

4983
01:31:16,139 --> 01:31:17,450
approach to governance and that's a
function of War that's where war is

4984
01:31:17,450 --> 01:31:17,460
function of War that's where war is
 

4985
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:19,669
function of War that's where war is
dangerous War has an inherent

4986
01:31:19,669 --> 01:31:19,679
dangerous War has an inherent
 

4987
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:22,790
dangerous War has an inherent
centralizing power in a democracy

4988
01:31:22,790 --> 01:31:22,800
centralizing power in a democracy
 

4989
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:24,649
centralizing power in a democracy
and that is dangerous because even when

4990
01:31:24,649 --> 01:31:24,659
and that is dangerous because even when
 

4991
01:31:24,659 --> 01:31:26,330
and that is dangerous because even when
you have the best of people running a

4992
01:31:26,330 --> 01:31:26,340
you have the best of people running a
 

4993
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:27,350
you have the best of people running a
war

4994
01:31:27,350 --> 01:31:27,360
war
 

4995
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,970
war
that gives them a lot of power to make

4996
01:31:28,970 --> 01:31:28,980
that gives them a lot of power to make
 

4997
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:30,649
that gives them a lot of power to make
decisions yeah how do you come down from

4998
01:31:30,649 --> 01:31:30,659
decisions yeah how do you come down from
 

4999
01:31:30,659 --> 01:31:32,629
decisions yeah how do you come down from
that I see that was the landscape Putin

5000
01:31:32,629 --> 01:31:32,639
that I see that was the landscape Putin
 

5001
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:34,490
that I see that was the landscape Putin
currently yep it's a war how do you come

5002
01:31:34,490 --> 01:31:34,500
currently yep it's a war how do you come
 

5003
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:36,530
currently yep it's a war how do you come
down because uh

5004
01:31:36,530 --> 01:31:36,540
down because uh
 

5005
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:39,229
down because uh
Ukraine and everybody anybody in the war

5006
01:31:39,229 --> 01:31:39,239
Ukraine and everybody anybody in the war
 

5007
01:31:39,239 --> 01:31:40,910
Ukraine and everybody anybody in the war
kind of especially if you're fighting

5008
01:31:40,910 --> 01:31:40,920
kind of especially if you're fighting
 

5009
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:42,830
kind of especially if you're fighting
for the ideal of democracy

5010
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:42,840
for the ideal of democracy
 

5011
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:45,890
for the ideal of democracy
it seems like war is anti-democratic it

5012
01:31:45,890 --> 01:31:45,900
it seems like war is anti-democratic it
 

5013
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:48,169
it seems like war is anti-democratic it
is so how do you come down from that

5014
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:48,179
is so how do you come down from that
 

5015
01:31:48,179 --> 01:31:51,530
is so how do you come down from that
what's the interesting mechanism of I

5016
01:31:51,530 --> 01:31:51,540
what's the interesting mechanism of I
 

5017
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:52,910
what's the interesting mechanism of I
mean some of it is leadership you have

5018
01:31:52,910 --> 01:31:52,920
mean some of it is leadership you have
 

5019
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:54,350
mean some of it is leadership you have
to be like a George Washington type

5020
01:31:54,350 --> 01:31:54,360
to be like a George Washington type
 

5021
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:56,689
to be like a George Washington type
figure be able to walk away from Power I

5022
01:31:56,689 --> 01:31:56,699
figure be able to walk away from Power I
 

5023
01:31:56,699 --> 01:31:58,129
figure be able to walk away from Power I
think you gave the answer right there

5024
01:31:58,129 --> 01:31:58,139
think you gave the answer right there
 

5025
01:31:58,139 --> 01:32:00,410
think you gave the answer right there
yeah you need to walk away from power or

5026
01:32:00,410 --> 01:32:00,420
yeah you need to walk away from power or
 

5027
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:01,790
yeah you need to walk away from power or
you need to be forced to walk away from

5028
01:32:01,790 --> 01:32:01,800
you need to be forced to walk away from
 

5029
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:03,530
you need to be forced to walk away from
Power historically one of the things

5030
01:32:03,530 --> 01:32:03,540
Power historically one of the things
 

5031
01:32:03,540 --> 01:32:06,169
Power historically one of the things
that democracies have tended to do when

5032
01:32:06,169 --> 01:32:06,179
that democracies have tended to do when
 

5033

when he's still in the war it's not
 

5043
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:19,310
when he's still in the war it's not
clear that he would have been elected

clear that he would have been elected
 

5045
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:21,169

what do you think would have happened if

5088
01:33:07,490 --> 01:33:07,500
what do you think would have happened if
 

5089
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:09,290
what do you think would have happened if
Lincoln had lived that's the sort of

5090
01:33:09,290 --> 01:33:09,300
Lincoln had lived that's the sort of

Lincoln had lived that's the sort of
counter factual view of History it's an

01:33:11,450 --> 01:33:11,460
counter factual view of History it's an
 

5093
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:12,890
counter factual view of History it's an
interesting question that probably you

5094
01:33:12,890 --> 01:33:12,900
interesting question that probably you
 

5095
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:14,810
interesting question that probably you
think about a lot this is a lot what

5096
01:33:14,810 --> 01:33:14,820
think about a lot this is a lot what
 

5097
01:33:14,820 --> 01:33:16,070
think about a lot this is a lot what
would have happened if you didn't get

5098
01:33:16,070 --> 01:33:16,080
would have happened if you didn't get
 

5099
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:17,870
would have happened if you didn't get
assassinated it's a reasonable question

5100
01:33:17,870 --> 01:33:17,880
assassinated it's a reasonable question
 

5101
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:19,310
assassinated it's a reasonable question
because it was not inevitable he'd be

5102
01:33:19,310 --> 01:33:19,320
because it was not inevitable he'd be
 

5103
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:20,570
because it was not inevitable he'd be
assassinated right he could have had

5104
01:33:20,570 --> 01:33:20,580
assassinated right he could have had
 

5105
01:33:20,580 --> 01:33:22,189
assassinated right he could have had
more protection that night he had

5106
01:33:22,189 --> 01:33:22,199
more protection that night he had
 

5107
01:33:22,199 --> 01:33:23,750
more protection that night he had
invited Ulysses Grant to go to the

5108
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:23,760
invited Ulysses Grant to go to the
 

5109
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:25,430
invited Ulysses Grant to go to the
theater with him and Grant and his wife

5110
01:33:25,430 --> 01:33:25,440
theater with him and Grant and his wife
 

5111
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:26,870
theater with him and Grant and his wife
didn't go if they had been there there

5112
01:33:26,870 --> 01:33:26,880
didn't go if they had been there there
 

5113
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:27,830
didn't go if they had been there there
would have been more protection for

5114
01:33:27,830 --> 01:33:27,840
would have been more protection for
 

5115
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:29,450
would have been more protection for
Grant so he would have had at least

5116
01:33:29,450 --> 01:33:29,460
Grant so he would have had at least
 

5117
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:31,790
Grant so he would have had at least
double the the security there

5118
01:33:31,790 --> 01:33:31,800
double the the security there
 

5119
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:33,410
double the the security there
um so there are many ways in which he

5120
01:33:33,410 --> 01:33:33,420
um so there are many ways in which he
 

5121
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:35,149
um so there are many ways in which he
might not have died I think it still

5122
01:33:35,149 --> 01:33:35,159
might not have died I think it still
 

5123
01:33:35,159 --> 01:33:37,430
might not have died I think it still
would have been a difficult transition

5124
01:33:37,430 --> 01:33:37,440
would have been a difficult transition
 

5125
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:39,169
would have been a difficult transition
but I think there were a few things that

5126
01:33:39,169 --> 01:33:39,179
but I think there were a few things that
 

5127
01:33:39,179 --> 01:33:40,189
but I think there were a few things that
would have been better first of all

5128
01:33:40,189 --> 01:33:40,199
would have been better first of all
 

5129
01:33:40,199 --> 01:33:41,870
would have been better first of all
Lincoln would not have pardoned all of

5130
01:33:41,870 --> 01:33:41,880
Lincoln would not have pardoned all of
 

5131
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:43,189
Lincoln would not have pardoned all of
these Confederate leaders and allowed

5132
01:33:43,189 --> 01:33:43,199
these Confederate leaders and allowed
 

5133
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:44,990
these Confederate leaders and allowed
them to come back into Power Lincoln

5134
01:33:44,990 --> 01:33:45,000
them to come back into Power Lincoln
 

5135
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,550
them to come back into Power Lincoln
also would have been a better politician

5136
01:33:46,550 --> 01:33:46,560
also would have been a better politician
 

5137
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,110
also would have been a better politician
at holding his Republican Coalition

5138
01:33:48,110 --> 01:33:48,120
at holding his Republican Coalition
 

5139
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:49,370
at holding his Republican Coalition
together

5140
01:33:49,370 --> 01:33:49,380
together
 

5141
01:33:49,380 --> 01:33:52,189
together
and I think Lincoln was more committed

5142
01:33:52,189 --> 01:33:52,199
and I think Lincoln was more committed
 

5143
01:33:52,199 --> 01:33:54,350
and I think Lincoln was more committed
to empowering former slaves and others

5144
01:33:54,350 --> 01:33:54,360
to empowering former slaves and others
 

5145
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:56,030
to empowering former slaves and others
so we still would have had a lot of

5146
01:33:56,030 --> 01:33:56,040
so we still would have had a lot of
 

5147
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:58,189
so we still would have had a lot of
conflicts but I think what would have

5148
01:33:58,189 --> 01:33:58,199
conflicts but I think what would have
 

5149
01:33:58,199 --> 01:34:00,169
conflicts but I think what would have
been a degree of difficulty was doubled

5150
01:34:00,169 --> 01:34:00,179
been a degree of difficulty was doubled
 

5151
01:34:00,179 --> 01:34:02,510
been a degree of difficulty was doubled
or tripled because

5152
01:34:02,510 --> 01:34:02,520
or tripled because
 

5153
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:04,370
or tripled because
um Lincoln was was removed and the

5154
01:34:04,370 --> 01:34:04,380
um Lincoln was was removed and the
 

5155
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:06,050
um Lincoln was was removed and the
opposite came into Power with Andrew

5156
01:34:06,050 --> 01:34:06,060
opposite came into Power with Andrew
 

5157
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:07,970
opposite came into Power with Andrew
Johnson so you don't think there's a

5158
01:34:07,970 --> 01:34:07,980
Johnson so you don't think there's a
 

5159
01:34:07,980 --> 01:34:10,310
Johnson so you don't think there's a
case you made the Andrew Johnson was

5160
01:34:10,310 --> 01:34:10,320
case you made the Andrew Johnson was
 

5161
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:12,830
case you made the Andrew Johnson was
turned out to be

5162
01:34:12,830 --> 01:34:12,840
turned out to be
 

5163
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:14,930
turned out to be
a bad decision but the spirit of the

5164
01:34:14,930 --> 01:34:14,940
a bad decision but the spirit of the
 

5165
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:16,970
a bad decision but the spirit of the
decision is the correct one no I think

5166
01:34:16,970 --> 01:34:16,980
decision is the correct one no I think
 

5167
01:34:16,980 --> 01:34:19,729
decision is the correct one no I think
it was a terrible decision because you

5168
01:34:19,729 --> 01:34:19,739
it was a terrible decision because you
 

5169
01:34:19,739 --> 01:34:21,350
it was a terrible decision because you
should never put someone one step away

5170
01:34:21,350 --> 01:34:21,360
should never put someone one step away
 

5171
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:23,450
should never put someone one step away
from enormous power who's not prepared

5172
01:34:23,450 --> 01:34:23,460
from enormous power who's not prepared
 

5173
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:26,510
from enormous power who's not prepared
oh in that sense yeah so uh in essence I

5174
01:34:26,510 --> 01:34:26,520
oh in that sense yeah so uh in essence I
 

5175
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:28,310
oh in that sense yeah so uh in essence I
got it but but the the other the spirit

5176
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:28,320
got it but but the the other the spirit
 

5177
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:30,169
got it but but the the other the spirit
of the decision meaning you put somebody

5178
01:34:30,169 --> 01:34:30,179
of the decision meaning you put somebody
 

5179
01:34:30,179 --> 01:34:31,970
of the decision meaning you put somebody
who's in a

5180
01:34:31,970 --> 01:34:31,980
who's in a
 

5181
01:34:31,980 --> 01:34:34,370
who's in a

represents a very opposing Viewpoint
than you well I'm for that so long as

that person is on board with some of the

01:34:56,390 --> 01:34:56,400
has to be praised for is in the midst of
 

5203
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:57,350

a war

5204
01:34:57,350 --> 01:34:57,360
a war
 

5205
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:59,209
a war
when at that point he was not doing well

5206
01:34:59,209 --> 01:34:59,219
when at that point he was not doing well
 

5207
01:34:59,219 --> 01:35:01,490
when at that point he was not doing well
the war was not going well he ran for

5208
01:35:01,490 --> 01:35:01,500
the war was not going well he ran for
 

5209
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:03,169
the war was not going well he ran for
re-election he didn't try to postpone

5210
01:35:03,169 --> 01:35:03,179
re-election he didn't try to postpone
 

5211
01:35:03,179 --> 01:35:04,490
re-election he didn't try to postpone
the election he didn't try to do

5212
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:04,500
the election he didn't try to do
 

5213
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:06,530
the election he didn't try to do
anything yeah and and so he needed all

5214
01:35:06,530 --> 01:35:06,540
anything yeah and and so he needed all
 

5215
01:35:06,540 --> 01:35:08,450
anything yeah and and so he needed all
the help he could get when running and

5216
01:35:08,450 --> 01:35:08,460
the help he could get when running and
 

5217
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:09,830
the help he could get when running and
so he wanted to have someone on there

5218
01:35:09,830 --> 01:35:09,840
so he wanted to have someone on there
 

5219
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:11,209
so he wanted to have someone on there
who looked like a Unity candidate who

5221
01:35:11,219 --> 01:35:13,910
who looked like a Unity candidate who
could appeal to some Southerners uh so

5222
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:13,920
could appeal to some Southerners uh so
 

5223
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,590
could appeal to some Southerners uh so
it made sense from a political point of

5224
01:35:15,590 --> 01:35:15,600
it made sense from a political point of
 

5225
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:16,310
it made sense from a political point of
view

5226
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:16,320
view
 

5227
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:18,590
view
uh but it created a really big problem

5228
01:35:18,590 --> 01:35:18,600
uh but it created a really big problem
 

5229
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:20,330
uh but it created a really big problem
and

5230
01:35:20,330 --> 01:35:20,340
and
 

5231
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:22,189
and
um there were people who said he should

5232
01:35:22,189 --> 01:35:22,199
um there were people who said he should
 

5233
01:35:22,199 --> 01:35:23,990
um there were people who said he should
have removed Johnson as soon as he was

5234
01:35:23,990 --> 01:35:24,000
have removed Johnson as soon as he was
 

5235
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,430
have removed Johnson as soon as he was
elected and in retrospect he probably

5236
01:35:25,430 --> 01:35:25,440
elected and in retrospect he probably
 

5237
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:27,709
elected and in retrospect he probably
should have how gangster is that to

5238
01:35:27,709 --> 01:35:27,719
should have how gangster is that to
 

5239
01:35:27,719 --> 01:35:29,810
should have how gangster is that to
during a war still run the election

5240
01:35:29,810 --> 01:35:29,820
during a war still run the election

Lincoln believed in Democratic Values he

5244
01:35:34,610 --> 01:35:34,620
Lincoln believed in Democratic Values he
 

5245
01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:36,169
Lincoln believed in Democratic Values he
also believed he would win but he knew

5246
01:35:36,169 --> 01:35:36,179
also believed he would win but he knew
 

5247
01:35:36,179 --> 01:35:38,209
also believed he would win but he knew
it was not guaranteed yeah and it's

5248
01:35:38,209 --> 01:35:38,219
it was not guaranteed yeah and it's
 

5249
01:35:38,219 --> 01:35:39,530
it was not guaranteed yeah and it's
interesting for for people don't know

5250
01:35:39,530 --> 01:35:39,540
interesting for for people don't know
 

5251
01:35:39,540 --> 01:35:40,610
interesting for for people don't know
this the reason we have mail in

5252
01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:40,620
this the reason we have mail in
 

5253
01:35:40,620 --> 01:35:41,990
this the reason we have mail in
balloting in the US is because of that

5254
01:35:41,990 --> 01:35:42,000
balloting in the US is because of that
 

5255
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,970
balloting in the US is because of that
so

5256
01:35:43,970 --> 01:35:43,980
so
 

5257
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:44,810
so
um

5258
01:35:44,810 --> 01:35:44,820
um
 

5259
01:35:44,820 --> 01:35:48,470
um
almost what uh I think it's almost a

5260
01:35:48,470 --> 01:35:48,480
almost what uh I think it's almost a
 

5261
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,910
almost what uh I think it's almost a
million uh

5262
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:49,920

01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:52,490
million uh
Union voters are away from their homes

5264
01:35:52,490 --> 01:35:52,500
Union voters are away from their homes
 

5265
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:55,070

5266
01:35:55,070 --> 01:35:55,080
and so how do they vote as soldiers as

office delivers their ballots that's why

5270
01:35:59,510 --> 01:35:59,520
office delivers their ballots that's why
 

5271
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,189
office delivers their ballots that's why
we have mail-in balloting

5272
01:36:01,189 --> 01:36:01,199
we have mail-in balloting
 

5273
01:36:01,199 --> 01:36:02,930
we have mail-in balloting
what about the other kind of factual

5274
01:36:02,930 --> 01:36:02,940
what about the other kind of factual
 

5275
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:04,669
what about the other kind of factual
question of what what would have

5276
01:36:04,669 --> 01:36:04,679
question of what what would have
 

5277
01:36:04,679 --> 01:36:06,169
question of what what would have
happened if Confederate States won the

5278
01:36:06,169 --> 01:36:06,179
happened if Confederate States won the
 

5279
01:36:06,179 --> 01:36:07,910
happened if Confederate States won the
war the Confederate States had won the

5280
01:36:07,910 --> 01:36:07,920
war the Confederate States had won the
 

5281
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:09,950
war the Confederate States had won the
war you would have seen I think a

5282
01:36:09,950 --> 01:36:09,960
war you would have seen I think a
 

5283
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:11,510
war you would have seen I think a
separate country

5284
01:36:11,510 --> 01:36:11,520
separate country
 

5285
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,250
separate country
and the South you would have seen two

5286
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:13,260
and the South you would have seen two
 

5287
01:36:13,260 --> 01:36:15,350
and the South you would have seen two
countries and that Confederate country

5288
01:36:15,350 --> 01:36:15,360
countries and that Confederate country
 

5289
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:17,450
countries and that Confederate country
would have been a smaller country but it

5290
01:36:17,450 --> 01:36:17,460
would have been a smaller country but it
 

5291
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:18,590
would have been a smaller country but it
probably would have been able to defend

5292
01:36:18,590 --> 01:36:18,600
probably would have been able to defend
 

5293
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:19,910
probably would have been able to defend
itself because it would have actually

5294
01:36:19,910 --> 01:36:19,920
itself because it would have actually
 

5295
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:21,649
itself because it would have actually
gotten much richer than it was it was

5296
01:36:21,649 --> 01:36:21,659
gotten much richer than it was it was
 

5297
01:36:21,659 --> 01:36:23,570
gotten much richer than it was it was
poor at the time but through its cotton

5298
01:36:23,570 --> 01:36:23,580
poor at the time but through its cotton
 

5299
01:36:23,580 --> 01:36:24,830
poor at the time but through its cotton
trade and other things it would have

5300
01:36:24,830 --> 01:36:24,840
trade and other things it would have
 

5301
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:26,390
trade and other things it would have
been recognized by Great Britain by

5302
01:36:26,390 --> 01:36:26,400
been recognized by Great Britain by
 

5303
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:28,970
been recognized by Great Britain by
France by other societies and you would

5304
01:36:28,970 --> 01:36:28,980
France by other societies and you would
 

5305
01:36:28,980 --> 01:36:30,350
France by other societies and you would
have seen

5306
01:36:30,350 --> 01:36:30,360
have seen
 

5307
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:33,110

would have seen that southern Republic

5310
01:36:34,550 --> 01:36:34,560
would have seen that southern Republic
 

5311
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:37,550
would have seen that southern Republic
dominate the continent the union had the

5312
01:36:37,550 --> 01:36:37,560
dominate the continent the union had the
 

5313
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:40,149

men and people and had the resources
 

5315
01:36:40,159 --> 01:36:43,129
men and people and had the resources
but you would have seen a rival Republic

5316
01:36:43,129 --> 01:36:43,139
but you would have seen a rival Republic
 

5317
01:36:43,139 --> 01:36:45,830

to the United States in the South do you
think they had interest to dominate the

5320
01:36:48,050 --> 01:36:48,060
think they had interest to dominate the
 

5321
01:36:48,060 --> 01:36:49,610
think they had interest to dominate the
continent to take over the the union

expanding into the Caribbean
 

5331
01:36:57,300 --> 01:36:59,570
expanding into the Caribbean
which was actually more feasible they

5332
01:36:59,570 --> 01:36:59,580
which was actually more feasible they
 

5333
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:02,030
which was actually more feasible they
did not have the Personnel to occupy so

5334
01:37:02,030 --> 01:37:02,040
did not have the Personnel to occupy so
 

5335

did not have the Personnel to occupy so
much territory going out west if you

01:37:03,649 --> 01:37:03,659
much territory going out west if you
 

5337
01:37:03,659 --> 01:37:04,910
much territory going out west if you
think about the amount of land that had

5338
01:37:04,910 --> 01:37:04,920
think about the amount of land that had
 

5339
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:07,370
think about the amount of land that had
to be covered but they had the nautical

01:37:07,370 --> 01:37:07,380
to be covered but they had the nautical

um to dominate islands in the Caribbean

5346
01:37:13,430 --> 01:37:13,440
um to dominate islands in the Caribbean
 

5347
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:14,750
um to dominate islands in the Caribbean
and those islands were important for

5348
01:37:14,750 --> 01:37:14,760
and those islands were important for
 

5349
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:16,250
and those islands were important for
their trade so there were many

5350
01:37:16,250 --> 01:37:16,260
their trade so there were many
 

5351
01:37:16,260 --> 01:37:17,390
their trade so there were many
Southerners who wanted to take control

5352
01:37:17,390 --> 01:37:17,400
Southerners who wanted to take control
 

5353
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:20,870
Southerners who wanted to take control
of Cuba wanted to take control of Haiti

5354
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:20,880
of Cuba wanted to take control of Haiti
 

5355
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:23,570
of Cuba wanted to take control of Haiti
and the Dominican Republic and so you

5356
01:37:23,570 --> 01:37:23,580
and the Dominican Republic and so you
 

5357
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:25,310
and the Dominican Republic and so you
probably would have seen Southern

5358
01:37:25,310 --> 01:37:25,320
probably would have seen Southern
 

5359
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:28,250
probably would have seen Southern
Warfare in those areas

5360
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:28,260
Warfare in those areas
 

5361
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:30,830
Warfare in those areas
from a counter factual history

5362
01:37:30,830 --> 01:37:30,840
from a counter factual history
 

5363
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:33,530
from a counter factual history
perspective can you make the case

5364
01:37:33,530 --> 01:37:33,540
perspective can you make the case
 

5365
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:36,830
perspective can you make the case
that secession would have been created a

5366
01:37:36,830 --> 01:37:36,840
that secession would have been created a
 

5367
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:38,629
that secession would have been created a
better world like if we're sitting today

5368
01:37:38,629 --> 01:37:38,639
better world like if we're sitting today
 

5369
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:41,149
better world like if we're sitting today
and do Back to the Future thing that's a

5370
01:37:41,149 --> 01:37:41,159
and do Back to the Future thing that's a
 

5371
01:37:41,159 --> 01:37:43,669
and do Back to the Future thing that's a
session in this context if we put aside

5372
01:37:43,669 --> 01:37:43,679
session in this context if we put aside
 

5373
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:47,330
session in this context if we put aside
the the suffering and the loss of life

5374
01:37:47,330 --> 01:37:47,340
the the suffering and the loss of life
 

5375
01:37:47,340 --> 01:37:50,149
the the suffering and the loss of life
in the war that we would be in a better

5376
01:37:50,149 --> 01:37:50,159
in the war that we would be in a better
 

5377
01:37:50,159 --> 01:37:52,310
in the war that we would be in a better
world today just look into a political

5378
01:37:52,310 --> 01:37:52,320
world today just look into a political
 

5379
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:54,050
world today just look into a political
climate or and can you also make the

5380
01:37:54,050 --> 01:37:54,060
climate or and can you also make the
 

5381
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:56,510
climate or and can you also make the
case that actually this outcome of the

5382
01:37:56,510 --> 01:37:56,520
case that actually this outcome of the
 

5383
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:58,850
case that actually this outcome of the
Union winning the war is the better one

5384
01:37:58,850 --> 01:37:58,860
Union winning the war is the better one
 

5385
01:37:58,860 --> 01:38:01,250
Union winning the war is the better one
I think the union union victory is by

5386
01:38:01,250 --> 01:38:01,260
I think the union union victory is by
 

5387
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:03,169
I think the union union victory is by
far the better outcome because I think

5388
01:38:03,169 --> 01:38:03,179
far the better outcome because I think
 

5389
01:38:03,179 --> 01:38:04,729
far the better outcome because I think
what you would have had otherwise is you

5390
01:38:04,729 --> 01:38:04,739
what you would have had otherwise is you
 

5391
01:38:04,739 --> 01:38:07,370
what you would have had otherwise is you
would have had a slave Republic in in

5392
01:38:07,370 --> 01:38:07,380
would have had a slave Republic in in
 

5393
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:09,110
would have had a slave Republic in in
the South that would have encouraged

5394
01:38:09,110 --> 01:38:09,120
the South that would have encouraged
 

5395
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:11,149
the South that would have encouraged
slavery in other parts of the world

5396
01:38:11,149 --> 01:38:11,159
slavery in other parts of the world
 

5397
01:38:11,159 --> 01:38:14,390
slavery in other parts of the world
would have exported slavery and would

5398
01:38:14,390 --> 01:38:14,400
would have exported slavery and would
 

5399
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:18,110
would have exported slavery and would
have necessarily been hostile to many of

5400
01:38:18,110 --> 01:38:18,120
have necessarily been hostile to many of
 

5401
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:19,790
have necessarily been hostile to many of
the positive changes that occur in the

5402
01:38:19,790 --> 01:38:19,800
the positive changes that occur in the
 

5403
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:21,830
the positive changes that occur in the
union the movement toward Progressive

5404
01:38:21,830 --> 01:38:21,840
union the movement toward Progressive
 

5405
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:23,629
union the movement toward Progressive
reforms creating cities with health

5406
01:38:23,629 --> 01:38:23,639
reforms creating cities with health
 

5407
01:38:23,639 --> 01:38:25,550
reforms creating cities with health
codes and public education and many of

5408
01:38:25,550 --> 01:38:25,560
codes and public education and many of
 

5409
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:26,810
codes and public education and many of
those things public education really

5410
01:38:26,810 --> 01:38:26,820
those things public education really
 

5411
01:38:26,820 --> 01:38:28,850
those things public education really
develops in the north as a way of

5412
01:38:28,850 --> 01:38:28,860
develops in the north as a way of
 

5413
01:38:28,860 --> 01:38:31,129
develops in the north as a way of
training workers who are being paid to

5414
01:38:31,129 --> 01:38:31,139
training workers who are being paid to
 

5415
01:38:31,139 --> 01:38:33,050
training workers who are being paid to
be better workers in a factory there's a

5416
01:38:33,050 --> 01:38:33,060
be better workers in a factory there's a
 

5417
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:34,310
be better workers in a factory there's a
reason you don't educate slaves because

5418
01:38:34,310 --> 01:38:34,320
reason you don't educate slaves because
 

5419
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,410
reason you don't educate slaves because
if you educate slaves they'll Rebel yeah

5420
01:38:36,410 --> 01:38:36,420
if you educate slaves they'll Rebel yeah
 

5421
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:39,290
if you educate slaves they'll Rebel yeah
so don't you think there'll be a huge uh

5422
01:38:39,290 --> 01:38:39,300
so don't you think there'll be a huge uh
 

5423
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:42,229
so don't you think there'll be a huge uh
pressure from the north to about slavery

5424
01:38:42,229 --> 01:38:42,239
pressure from the north to about slavery
 

5425
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:44,330
pressure from the north to about slavery
anyway it would but I think the South

5426
01:38:44,330 --> 01:38:44,340
anyway it would but I think the South
 

5427
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:46,250
anyway it would but I think the South
could have survived without another War

5428
01:38:46,250 --> 01:38:46,260
could have survived without another War
 

5429
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:48,470
could have survived without another War
I mean I think the way that slavery

5430
01:38:48,470 --> 01:38:48,480
I mean I think the way that slavery
 

5431
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:51,830
I mean I think the way that slavery
would have would have ended in the South

5432
01:38:51,830 --> 01:38:51,840
would have would have ended in the South
 

5433
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:53,750
would have would have ended in the South
if it didn't end with the Civil War it

5434
01:38:53,750 --> 01:38:53,760
if it didn't end with the Civil War it
 

5435
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:55,370
if it didn't end with the Civil War it
would have been with another War

5436
01:38:55,370 --> 01:38:55,380
would have been with another War
 

5437
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:58,010
would have been with another War
I guess the deeper question is is it

5438
01:38:58,010 --> 01:38:58,020
I guess the deeper question is is it
 

5439
01:38:58,020 --> 01:39:00,169
I guess the deeper question is is it
better to work through your problems

5440
01:39:00,169 --> 01:39:00,179
better to work through your problems
 

5441
01:39:00,179 --> 01:39:02,090
better to work through your problems
together or is it better to get a

5442
01:39:02,090 --> 01:39:02,100
together or is it better to get a
 

5443
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:03,290
together or is it better to get a
divorce

5444
01:39:03,290 --> 01:39:03,300
divorce
 

5445
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:05,149
divorce
I think in this case it was better to

5446
01:39:05,149 --> 01:39:05,159
I think in this case it was better to
 

5447
01:39:05,159 --> 01:39:06,770
I think in this case it was better to
work through the problems not even

5448
01:39:06,770 --> 01:39:06,780
work through the problems not even
 

5449
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:07,610
work through the problems not even
working through them together it's

5450
01:39:07,610 --> 01:39:07,620
working through them together it's
 

5451
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:08,810
working through them together it's
better to work through the problems

5452
01:39:08,810 --> 01:39:08,820
better to work through the problems
 

5453
01:39:08,820 --> 01:39:12,110
better to work through the problems
where one side has the resources to

5454
01:39:12,110 --> 01:39:12,120
where one side has the resources to
 

5455
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:13,669
where one side has the resources to
incentivize you to work through the

5456
01:39:13,669 --> 01:39:13,679
incentivize you to work through the
 

5457
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:15,830
incentivize you to work through the
problems rather than leaving you on your

5458
01:39:15,830 --> 01:39:15,840
problems rather than leaving you on your
 

5459
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,450
problems rather than leaving you on your
own to go your own to go your own

5460
01:39:17,450 --> 01:39:17,460
own to go your own to go your own
 

5461
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:19,729
own to go your own to go your own
Direction I think the argument against

5462
01:39:19,729 --> 01:39:19,739
Direction I think the argument against
 

5463
01:39:19,739 --> 01:39:22,310
Direction I think the argument against
the union winning would be the argument

5464
01:39:22,310 --> 01:39:22,320
the union winning would be the argument
 

5465
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:24,169
the union winning would be the argument
that would be made by those who believe

5466
01:39:24,169 --> 01:39:24,179
that would be made by those who believe
 

5467
01:39:24,179 --> 01:39:26,209
that would be made by those who believe
they suffered from Union power later on

5468
01:39:26,209 --> 01:39:26,219
they suffered from Union power later on
 

5469
01:39:26,219 --> 01:39:29,390
they suffered from Union power later on
so you could argue if you're a historian

5470
01:39:29,390 --> 01:39:29,400
so you could argue if you're a historian
 

5471
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:31,070
so you could argue if you're a historian
of Native Americans

5472
01:39:31,070 --> 01:39:31,080
of Native Americans
 

5473
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:32,870
of Native Americans
uh if you're historian of the

5474
01:39:32,870 --> 01:39:32,880
uh if you're historian of the
 

5475
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:34,910
uh if you're historian of the
Philippines You could argue some of the

5476
01:39:34,910 --> 01:39:34,920
Philippines You could argue some of the
 

5477
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:37,550
Philippines You could argue some of the
areas where this newly United Nation

5478
01:39:37,550 --> 01:39:37,560
areas where this newly United Nation
 

5479
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:39,530
areas where this newly United Nation
coming out of the Civil War was able to

5480
01:39:39,530 --> 01:39:39,540
coming out of the Civil War was able to
 

5481
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:41,870
coming out of the Civil War was able to
use its power to spread its influence it

5482
01:39:41,870 --> 01:39:41,880
use its power to spread its influence it
 

5483
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:43,370
use its power to spread its influence it
would have been harder for the union to

5484
01:39:43,370 --> 01:39:43,380
would have been harder for the union to
 

5485
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:45,890
would have been harder for the union to
do that uh if the union had to deal with

5486
01:39:45,890 --> 01:39:45,900
do that uh if the union had to deal with
 

5487
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:47,689
do that uh if the union had to deal with
a rival to the South

5488
01:39:47,689 --> 01:39:47,699
a rival to the South
 

5489
01:39:47,699 --> 01:39:51,290
a rival to the South
so as a historian the union won

5490
01:39:51,290 --> 01:39:51,300
so as a historian the union won
 

5491
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:54,830
so as a historian the union won
to which degree are the people from the

5492
01:39:54,830 --> 01:39:54,840
to which degree are the people from the
 

5493
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:56,930
to which degree are the people from the
union there is now the United States the

5494
01:39:56,930 --> 01:39:56,940
union there is now the United States the
 

5495
01:39:56,940 --> 01:39:58,610
union there is now the United States the
writers of the history

5496
01:39:58,610 --> 01:39:58,620
writers of the history
 

5497
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:01,370
writers of the history
that that color the perspective of who's

5498
01:40:01,370 --> 01:40:01,380
that that color the perspective of who's
 

5499
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:03,649
that that color the perspective of who's
the good guys and the bad guys so this

5500
01:40:03,649 --> 01:40:03,659
the good guys and the bad guys so this
 

5501
01:40:03,659 --> 01:40:05,629
the good guys and the bad guys so this
is such an interesting question because

5502
01:40:05,629 --> 01:40:05,639
is such an interesting question because
 

5503
01:40:05,639 --> 01:40:07,729
is such an interesting question because
I like how you take every question I ask

5504
01:40:07,729 --> 01:40:07,739
I like how you take every question I ask
 

5505
01:40:07,739 --> 01:40:09,310
I like how you take every question I ask
and make it into a better question

5506
01:40:09,310 --> 01:40:09,320
and make it into a better question
 

5507
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:11,689
and make it into a better question
that's a deep I deeply appreciate it

5508
01:40:11,689 --> 01:40:11,699
that's a deep I deeply appreciate it
 

5509
01:40:11,699 --> 01:40:13,669
that's a deep I deeply appreciate it
I'll ask every time I ask some

5510
01:40:13,669 --> 01:40:13,679
I'll ask every time I ask some
 

5511
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:15,290
I'll ask every time I ask some
ridiculous question and you go that's

5512
01:40:15,290 --> 01:40:15,300
ridiculous question and you go that's
 

5513
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:17,270
ridiculous question and you go that's
really interesting because they're

5514
01:40:17,270 --> 01:40:17,280
really interesting because they're
 

5515
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,470
really interesting because they're
really good questions they're thoughtful

5516
01:40:18,470 --> 01:40:18,480
really good questions they're thoughtful
 

5517
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:19,729
really good questions they're thoughtful
questions you know actually the best

5518
01:40:19,729 --> 01:40:19,739
questions you know actually the best
 

5519
01:40:19,739 --> 01:40:21,890
questions you know actually the best
questions are not the simple ones right

5520
01:40:21,890 --> 01:40:21,900
questions are not the simple ones right
 

5521
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:24,470
questions are not the simple ones right
so um

5522
01:40:24,470 --> 01:40:24,480
so um
 

5523
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:25,550
so um
foreign

5524
01:40:25,550 --> 01:40:25,560
foreign
 

5525
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:28,430
foreign
the Axiom is that the winners write

5526
01:40:28,430 --> 01:40:28,440
the Axiom is that the winners write
 

5527
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:30,169
the Axiom is that the winners write
history yeah and that's usually the case

5528
01:40:30,169 --> 01:40:30,179
history yeah and that's usually the case
 

5529
01:40:30,179 --> 01:40:32,510
history yeah and that's usually the case
right most of the history I learned

5530
01:40:32,510 --> 01:40:32,520
right most of the history I learned
 

5531
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:34,430
right most of the history I learned
about Ukraine when I was growing up was

5532
01:40:34,430 --> 01:40:34,440
about Ukraine when I was growing up was
 

5533
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:36,229
about Ukraine when I was growing up was
written by Russians it was Russian

5534
01:40:36,229 --> 01:40:36,239
written by Russians it was Russian
 

5535
01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:38,750
written by Russians it was Russian
history of Ukraine uh most of the

5536
01:40:38,750 --> 01:40:38,760
history of Ukraine uh most of the
 

5537
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:40,010
history of Ukraine uh most of the
history of Europe has been written by

5538
01:40:40,010 --> 01:40:40,020
history of Europe has been written by
 

5539
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:41,810
history of Europe has been written by
Germans and French and and British

5540
01:40:41,810 --> 01:40:41,820
Germans and French and and British
 

5541
01:40:41,820 --> 01:40:43,910
Germans and French and and British
citizens right I mean so usually it's

5542
01:40:43,910 --> 01:40:43,920
citizens right I mean so usually it's
 

5543
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:45,649
citizens right I mean so usually it's
that way and for the most part our

5544
01:40:45,649 --> 01:40:45,659
that way and for the most part our
 

5545
01:40:45,659 --> 01:40:47,390
that way and for the most part our
history has been written from a sort of

5546
01:40:47,390 --> 01:40:47,400
history has been written from a sort of
 

5547
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:49,430
history has been written from a sort of
Northeastern point of view but it's very

5548
01:40:49,430 --> 01:40:49,440
Northeastern point of view but it's very
 

5549
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:51,169
Northeastern point of view but it's very
interesting the history of the years

5550
01:40:51,169 --> 01:40:51,179
interesting the history of the years
 

5551

interesting the history of the years
after the Civil War that I focus on in

you know uh the Soviet unions are the

5648
01:42:37,490 --> 01:42:37,500
you know uh the Soviet unions are the
 

5649
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:39,109
you know uh the Soviet unions are the
ones that suffered and often actually

5650
01:42:39,109 --> 01:42:39,119
ones that suffered and often actually
 

5651
01:42:39,119 --> 01:42:41,090
ones that suffered and often actually
don't emphasize the suffering they

5652
01:42:41,090 --> 01:42:41,100
don't emphasize the suffering they
 

5653
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:43,250
don't emphasize the suffering they
emphasize the glory that they defeated

5654
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:43,260
emphasize the glory that they defeated
 

5655
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:45,050
emphasize the glory that they defeated
this huge evil but then you listen to

5656
01:42:45,050 --> 01:42:45,060
this huge evil but then you listen to
 

5657
01:42:45,060 --> 01:42:46,850
this huge evil but then you listen to
the United States perspective on this

5658
01:42:46,850 --> 01:42:46,860
the United States perspective on this
 

5659
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:50,990
the United States perspective on this
and it's almost like the the I mean

5660
01:42:50,990 --> 01:42:51,000
and it's almost like the the I mean
 

5661
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,669
and it's almost like the the I mean
there's several ways of phrasing it but

5662
01:42:52,669 --> 01:42:52,679
there's several ways of phrasing it but
 

5663
01:42:52,679 --> 01:42:54,169
there's several ways of phrasing it but
basically the United States won the war

5664
01:42:54,169 --> 01:42:54,179
basically the United States won the war
 

5665
01:42:54,179 --> 01:42:55,850
basically the United States won the war
without the United States it would be

5666
01:42:55,850 --> 01:42:55,860
without the United States it would be
 

5667
01:42:55,860 --> 01:42:57,350
without the United States it would be
impossible to win the war there were the

5668
01:42:57,350 --> 01:42:57,360
impossible to win the war there were the
 

5669
01:42:57,360 --> 01:42:59,629
impossible to win the war there were the
turning point there were the the last

5670
01:42:59,629 --> 01:42:59,639
turning point there were the the last
 

5671
01:42:59,639 --> 01:43:02,149
turning point there were the the last
there were uh one of my last my

5672
01:43:02,149 --> 01:43:02,159
there were uh one of my last my
 

5673
01:43:02,159 --> 01:43:04,850
there were uh one of my last my
everything that that song uh um my first

5674
01:43:04,850 --> 01:43:04,860
everything that that song uh um my first
 

5675
01:43:04,860 --> 01:43:07,729
everything that that song uh um my first
my last my everything so so that and I'm

5676
01:43:07,729 --> 01:43:07,739
my last my everything so so that and I'm
 

5677
01:43:07,739 --> 01:43:10,629
my last my everything so so that and I'm
sure I wonder what what growing up

5678
01:43:10,629 --> 01:43:10,639
sure I wonder what what growing up
 

5679
01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:14,870
sure I wonder what what growing up
in uh maybe after war in in Britain I

5680
01:43:14,870 --> 01:43:14,880
in uh maybe after war in in Britain I
 

5681
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:16,129
in uh maybe after war in in Britain I
wonder if there's history books written

5682
01:43:16,129 --> 01:43:16,139
wonder if there's history books written
 

5683
01:43:16,139 --> 01:43:17,510
wonder if there's history books written
there that basically saying they could

5684
01:43:17,510 --> 01:43:17,520
there that basically saying they could
 

5685
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:19,250
there that basically saying they could
also make a pretty strong case that

5686
01:43:19,250 --> 01:43:19,260
also make a pretty strong case that
 

5687
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:22,310
also make a pretty strong case that
Britain was Central to the turning point

5688
01:43:22,310 --> 01:43:22,320
Britain was Central to the turning point
 

5689
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,470
Britain was Central to the turning point
you could really make a strong case that

5690
01:43:24,470 --> 01:43:24,480
you could really make a strong case that
 

5691
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:27,410
you could really make a strong case that
like Churchill and Britain uh were like

5692
01:43:27,410 --> 01:43:27,420
like Churchill and Britain uh were like
 

5693
01:43:27,420 --> 01:43:29,090
like Churchill and Britain uh were like
the turning point of the war that the

5694
01:43:29,090 --> 01:43:29,100
the turning point of the war that the
 

5695
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:30,709
the turning point of the war that the
that they're responsible for some of the

5696
01:43:30,709 --> 01:43:30,719
that they're responsible for some of the
 

5697
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:32,810
that they're responsible for some of the
first failures major failures of Hitler

5698
01:43:32,810 --> 01:43:32,820
first failures major failures of Hitler
 

5699
01:43:32,820 --> 01:43:35,149
first failures major failures of Hitler
from a military strategy perspective but

5700
01:43:35,149 --> 01:43:35,159
from a military strategy perspective but
 

5701
01:43:35,159 --> 01:43:37,609
from a military strategy perspective but
uh that's interesting to look at that

5702
01:43:37,609 --> 01:43:37,619
uh that's interesting to look at that
 

5703
01:43:37,619 --> 01:43:39,530
uh that's interesting to look at that
very recent history from very different

5704
01:43:39,530 --> 01:43:39,540
very recent history from very different
 

5705
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:41,030
very recent history from very different
perspectives and it's the same problem

5706
01:43:41,030 --> 01:43:41,040
perspectives and it's the same problem
 

5707
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:42,410
perspectives and it's the same problem
with the Civil War we want to tell the

5708
01:43:42,410 --> 01:43:42,420
with the Civil War we want to tell the
 

5709

then everything is good yeah and it's
 

5713
01:43:46,619 --> 01:43:48,950
then everything is good yeah and it's
not the way it's not the way it worked

5714
01:43:48,950 --> 01:43:48,960
not the way it's not the way it worked
 

5715
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:51,950
not the way it's not the way it worked
um what I'm really trying to get at is

5716
01:43:51,950 --> 01:43:51,960
um what I'm really trying to get at is
 

5717

uh when you love your country you have
 

5719
01:43:54,179 --> 01:43:56,570
uh when you love your country you have
to study the failures because by

01:43:56,570 --> 01:43:56,580
to study the failures because by
 

5721
01:43:56,580 --> 01:43:58,430
to study the failures because by
studying the failures that's how you

5722
01:43:58,430 --> 01:43:58,440
studying the failures that's how you
 

5723

studying the failures that's how you
improve yourself and that's where you

5724
01:43:59,629 --> 01:43:59,639
improve yourself and that's where you
 

5725
01:43:59,639 --> 01:44:02,030
improve yourself and that's where you
see where where real courage is it's

5726
01:44:02,030 --> 01:44:02,040
see where where real courage is it's
 

5727
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:04,430
see where where real courage is it's
actually that Lincoln failed for so long

in the 19th century
 

6331
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:11,450
in the 19th century
um this notion that there is one

6332
01:55:11,450 --> 01:55:11,460
um this notion that there is one

01:55:16,189 --> 01:55:16,199
of it that's actually really a 20th
 

6337
01:55:16,199 --> 01:55:18,470
of it that's actually really a 20th
century creation it precedes the

6338
01:55:18,470 --> 01:55:18,480
century creation it precedes the
 

6339
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:20,510
century creation it precedes the
Evangelical movement but it's been made

6340
01:55:20,510 --> 01:55:20,520
Evangelical movement but it's been made
 

6341
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:22,790
Evangelical movement but it's been made
even more popular but it would not make

6342
01:55:22,790 --> 01:55:22,800
even more popular but it would not make
 

6343
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:24,890
even more popular but it would not make
sense to a Confederate to say we're a

6344
01:55:24,890 --> 01:55:24,900
sense to a Confederate to say we're a
 

6345
01:55:24,900 --> 01:55:26,629
sense to a Confederate to say we're a
right white Christian Nation it would

6346
01:55:26,629 --> 01:55:26,639
right white Christian Nation it would
 

6347
01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:28,209
right white Christian Nation it would
make sense to say we're a white

6348
01:55:28,209 --> 01:55:28,219
make sense to say we're a white
 

6349
01:55:28,219 --> 01:55:30,709
make sense to say we're a white
Protestant Nation because they didn't

6350
01:55:30,709 --> 01:55:30,719

consider Catholics good Christians or a

6352
01:55:32,570 --> 01:55:32,580
consider Catholics good Christians or a
 

6353
01:55:32,580 --> 01:55:35,149
consider Catholics good Christians or a
white Presbyterian Nation

6354
01:55:35,149 --> 01:55:35,159
white Presbyterian Nation
 

6355
01:55:35,159 --> 01:55:37,970
white Presbyterian Nation
um and so that's that's something new

6356
01:55:37,970 --> 01:55:37,980
um and so that's that's something new
 

6357
01:55:37,980 --> 01:55:40,370
um and so that's that's something new
and I think with particularly dangerous

6598
01:59:59,330 --> 01:59:59,340
votes if he loses those States the
 

6599
01:59:59,340 --> 02:00:01,370
votes if he loses those States the
electors in those States all of which go

6600
02:00:01,370 --> 02:00:01,380
electors in those States all of which go
 

6601
02:00:01,380 --> 02:00:03,050
electors in those States all of which go
to the winner of the state would

6602
02:00:03,050 --> 02:00:03,060
to the winner of the state would
 

6603
02:00:03,060 --> 02:00:04,910
to the winner of the state would
actually make Rutherford B Hayes the

6604
02:00:04,910 --> 02:00:04,920
actually make Rutherford B Hayes the
 

6605
02:00:04,920 --> 02:00:06,950
actually make Rutherford B Hayes the
Republican candidate president in all

6606
02:00:06,950 --> 02:00:06,960
Republican candidate president in all
 

6607
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:08,209
Republican candidate president in all
three of those States you also have

6608
02:00:08,209 --> 02:00:08,219
three of those States you also have
 

6609
02:00:08,219 --> 02:00:10,129
three of those States you also have
Republican Governors who have just lost

6610
02:00:10,129 --> 02:00:10,139
Republican Governors who have just lost
 

6611
02:00:10,139 --> 02:00:11,689
Republican Governors who have just lost
but are still the people who have to

6612
02:00:11,689 --> 02:00:11,699
but are still the people who have to
 

6613
02:00:11,699 --> 02:00:13,430
but are still the people who have to
certify the election

6614
02:00:13,430 --> 02:00:13,440
certify the election
 

6615
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:15,709
certify the election
all three states say that hey is one

6616
02:00:15,709 --> 02:00:15,719
all three states say that hey is one
 

6617
02:00:15,719 --> 02:00:17,750
all three states say that hey is one
even though it's very close and disputed

6618
02:00:17,750 --> 02:00:17,760
even though it's very close and disputed
 

6619
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:21,169
even though it's very close and disputed
so Hayes has one more electoral vote

6620
02:00:21,169 --> 02:00:21,179
so Hayes has one more electoral vote
 

6621
02:00:21,179 --> 02:00:22,370
so Hayes has one more electoral vote
of course the Democrats won't accept

6622
02:00:22,370 --> 02:00:22,380
of course the Democrats won't accept
 

6623
02:00:22,380 --> 02:00:25,910
of course the Democrats won't accept
that and so we go into February that the

6624
02:00:25,910 --> 02:00:25,920
that and so we go into February that the
 

6625
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:27,410
that and so we go into February that the
inauguration was done in March not in

6626
02:00:27,410 --> 02:00:27,420
inauguration was done in March not in
 

6627
02:00:27,420 --> 02:00:29,149
inauguration was done in March not in
January we go from November to February

6628
02:00:29,149 --> 02:00:29,159
January we go from November to February
 

6629
02:00:29,159 --> 02:00:31,310
January we go from November to February
without clear agreement on who the

6630
02:00:31,310 --> 02:00:31,320
without clear agreement on who the
 

6631
02:00:31,320 --> 02:00:33,470
without clear agreement on who the
president is in the end there's an

6632
02:00:33,470 --> 02:00:33,480
president is in the end there's an
 

6633
02:00:33,480 --> 02:00:36,109
president is in the end there's an
agreement that they come to a deal which

6634
02:00:36,109 --> 02:00:36,119
agreement that they come to a deal which
 

6635
02:00:36,119 --> 02:00:37,970
agreement that they come to a deal which
is where the Democrats will accept Hayes

6636
02:00:37,970 --> 02:00:37,980
is where the Democrats will accept Hayes
 

6637
02:00:37,980 --> 02:00:39,890
is where the Democrats will accept Hayes
as president in return for Hayes doing

6638
02:00:39,890 --> 02:00:39,900
as president in return for Hayes doing
 

6639
02:00:39,900 --> 02:00:41,629
as president in return for Hayes doing
all the things the Democrats want in the

6640
02:00:41,629 --> 02:00:41,639
all the things the Democrats want in the
 

6641
02:00:41,639 --> 02:00:42,649
all the things the Democrats want in the
south

6642
02:00:42,649 --> 02:00:42,659
south
 

6643
02:00:42,659 --> 02:00:45,790
south
and so in essence you have a deal made

6644
02:00:45,790 --> 02:00:45,800
and so in essence you have a deal made
 

6645
02:00:45,800 --> 02:00:49,010
and so in essence you have a deal made
that one side will get all its all it

6646
02:00:49,010 --> 02:00:49,020
that one side will get all its all it
 

6647
02:00:49,020 --> 02:00:51,229
that one side will get all its all it
wants while allowing the other side to

6648
02:00:51,229 --> 02:00:51,239
wants while allowing the other side to
 

6649
02:00:51,239 --> 02:00:52,609
wants while allowing the other side to
have the figurehead

6650
02:00:52,609 --> 02:00:52,619
have the figurehead
 

6651
02:00:52,619 --> 02:00:55,490
have the figurehead
and so in a certain way this marks a

6652
02:00:55,490 --> 02:00:55,500
and so in a certain way this marks a
 

6653
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:58,189
and so in a certain way this marks a
moment when the Confederacy wins

6654
02:00:58,189 --> 02:00:58,199
moment when the Confederacy wins
 

6655
02:00:58,199 --> 02:01:00,470
moment when the Confederacy wins
for example Hayes has to agree to pull

6656
02:01:00,470 --> 02:01:00,480
for example Hayes has to agree to pull
 

6657
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:02,270
for example Hayes has to agree to pull
out all federal force from the south

6658
02:01:02,270 --> 02:01:02,280
out all federal force from the south
 

6659
02:01:02,280 --> 02:01:04,609
out all federal force from the south
which means there's no protection for

6660
02:01:04,609 --> 02:01:04,619
which means there's no protection for
 

6661
02:01:04,619 --> 02:01:06,530
which means there's no protection for
fair elections going forward and you'll

6662
02:01:06,530 --> 02:01:06,540
fair elections going forward and you'll
 

6663
02:01:06,540 --> 02:01:09,109
fair elections going forward and you'll
see in States like Mississippi uh the

6664
02:01:09,109 --> 02:01:09,119
see in States like Mississippi uh the
 

6665
02:01:09,119 --> 02:01:11,169
see in States like Mississippi uh the
number of African-American voters will

6666
02:01:11,169 --> 02:01:11,179
number of African-American voters will
 

6667
02:01:11,179 --> 02:01:13,910
number of African-American voters will
Decline and not recover again until the

6668
02:01:13,910 --> 02:01:13,920
Decline and not recover again until the
 

6669
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:16,790
Decline and not recover again until the
late 20th century so that's what that

6670
02:01:16,790 --> 02:01:16,800
late 20th century so that's what that
 

6671
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:19,490
late 20th century so that's what that
election does and from 1876 until 1896

6672
02:01:19,490 --> 02:01:19,500
election does and from 1876 until 1896
 

6673
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:20,930
election does and from 1876 until 1896
we have a series of Elections that are

6674
02:01:20,930 --> 02:01:20,940
we have a series of Elections that are
 

6675
02:01:20,940 --> 02:01:22,810
we have a series of Elections that are
very close it happens also

6676
02:01:22,810 --> 02:01:22,820
very close it happens also
 

6677
02:01:22,820 --> 02:01:26,990
very close it happens also
in 1888 that the person with the most

6678
02:01:26,990 --> 02:01:27,000
in 1888 that the person with the most
 

6679
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:28,609
in 1888 that the person with the most
popular vote loses that's Grover

6680
02:01:28,609 --> 02:01:28,619
popular vote loses that's Grover
 

6681
02:01:28,619 --> 02:01:31,729
popular vote loses that's Grover
Cleveland who loses to Benjamin Harrison

6682
02:01:31,729 --> 02:01:31,739
Cleveland who loses to Benjamin Harrison
 

6683
02:01:31,739 --> 02:01:33,649
Cleveland who loses to Benjamin Harrison
um and again we'll have the same issue

6684
02:01:33,649 --> 02:01:33,659
um and again we'll have the same issue
 

6685
02:01:33,659 --> 02:01:36,169
um and again we'll have the same issue
where there's a dispute and so what that

6686
02:01:36,169 --> 02:01:36,179
where there's a dispute and so what that
 

6687
02:01:36,179 --> 02:01:40,129
where there's a dispute and so what that
election shows us 1876 1888 is that our

6688
02:01:40,129 --> 02:01:40,139
election shows us 1876 1888 is that our
 

6689
02:01:40,139 --> 02:01:41,390
election shows us 1876 1888 is that our
election system and the problem of

6690
02:01:41,390 --> 02:01:41,400
election system and the problem of
 

6691
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:42,770
election system and the problem of
having an electoral college really

6692
02:01:42,770 --> 02:01:42,780
having an electoral college really
 

6693
02:01:42,780 --> 02:01:44,390
having an electoral college really
complicates things and makes it harder

6694
02:01:44,390 --> 02:01:44,400
complicates things and makes it harder
 

6695
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:46,609
complicates things and makes it harder
for us to come to any kind of consensus

6696
02:01:46,609 --> 02:01:46,619
for us to come to any kind of consensus
 

6697
02:01:46,619 --> 02:01:48,770
for us to come to any kind of consensus
any kind of agreement on who's won an

6698
02:01:48,770 --> 02:01:48,780
any kind of agreement on who's won an
 

6699
02:01:48,780 --> 02:01:50,510
any kind of agreement on who's won an
election super important for today

6700
02:01:50,510 --> 02:01:50,520
election super important for today
 

6701
02:01:50,520 --> 02:01:53,030
election super important for today
because most of the 20th century we

6702
02:01:53,030 --> 02:01:53,040
because most of the 20th century we
 

6703
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:54,290
because most of the 20th century we
don't have close elections so it doesn't

6704
02:01:54,290 --> 02:01:54,300
don't have close elections so it doesn't
 

6705
02:01:54,300 --> 02:01:56,270
don't have close elections so it doesn't
matter when we come to a world today

6706
02:01:56,270 --> 02:01:56,280
matter when we come to a world today
 

6707
02:01:56,280 --> 02:01:58,010
matter when we come to a world today
where our elections are very close our

6708
02:01:58,010 --> 02:01:58,020
where our elections are very close our
 

6709
02:01:58,020 --> 02:02:00,290
where our elections are very close our
system is not well designed to deal with

6710
02:02:00,290 --> 02:02:00,300
system is not well designed to deal with
 

6711
02:02:00,300 --> 02:02:02,930
system is not well designed to deal with
those issues do you draw any parallels

6712
02:02:02,930 --> 02:02:02,940
those issues do you draw any parallels
 

6713
02:02:02,940 --> 02:02:05,570
those issues do you draw any parallels
uh with our time and what are some key

6714
02:02:05,570 --> 02:02:05,580
uh with our time and what are some key
 

6715
02:02:05,580 --> 02:02:07,129
uh with our time and what are some key
differences there's been contested

6716
02:02:07,129 --> 02:02:07,139
differences there's been contested
 

6717
02:02:07,139 --> 02:02:10,490
differences there's been contested
elections uh Florida Florida

6718
02:02:10,490 --> 02:02:10,500
elections uh Florida Florida
 

6719
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:12,830
elections uh Florida Florida
with Al Gore and there's been just

6720
02:02:12,830 --> 02:02:12,840
with Al Gore and there's been just
 

6721
02:02:12,840 --> 02:02:14,810
with Al Gore and there's been just
contest election after contested

6722
02:02:14,810 --> 02:02:14,820
contest election after contested
 

6723
02:02:14,820 --> 02:02:16,729
contest election after contested
election and of course most famously

6724
02:02:16,729 --> 02:02:16,739
election and of course most famously
 

6725
02:02:16,739 --> 02:02:17,890
election and of course most famously
recently

6726
02:02:17,890 --> 02:02:17,900
recently
 

6727
02:02:17,900 --> 02:02:20,750
recently
uh with the the contested election that

6728
02:02:20,750 --> 02:02:20,760
uh with the the contested election that
 

6729
02:02:20,760 --> 02:02:24,649
uh with the the contested election that
led to uh January 6th so I think uh a

6730
02:02:24,649 --> 02:02:24,659
led to uh January 6th so I think uh a
 

6731
02:02:24,659 --> 02:02:25,850
led to uh January 6th so I think uh a
couple of parallels and a couple of

6732
02:02:25,850 --> 02:02:25,860
couple of parallels and a couple of
 

6733
02:02:25,860 --> 02:02:27,470
couple of parallels and a couple of
differences one parallel is that when

6734
02:02:27,470 --> 02:02:27,480
differences one parallel is that when
 

6735
02:02:27,480 --> 02:02:30,410
differences one parallel is that when
you have close elections uh the losing

6736
02:02:30,410 --> 02:02:30,420
you have close elections uh the losing
 

6737
02:02:30,420 --> 02:02:31,850
you have close elections uh the losing
side is never happy

6738
02:02:31,850 --> 02:02:31,860
side is never happy
 

6739
02:02:31,860 --> 02:02:33,530
side is never happy
it's a myth

6740
02:02:33,530 --> 02:02:33,540
it's a myth
 

6741
02:02:33,540 --> 02:02:35,209
it's a myth
that when you have a close election the

6742
02:02:35,209 --> 02:02:35,219
that when you have a close election the
 

6743
02:02:35,219 --> 02:02:37,129
that when you have a close election the
other side just accepts it and it's not

6744
02:02:37,129 --> 02:02:37,139
other side just accepts it and it's not
 

6745
02:02:37,139 --> 02:02:39,109
other side just accepts it and it's not
that doesn't happen and we need to be

6746
02:02:39,109 --> 02:02:39,119
that doesn't happen and we need to be
 

6747
02:02:39,119 --> 02:02:40,430
that doesn't happen and we need to be
attentive to that and ready for that

6748
02:02:40,430 --> 02:02:40,440
attentive to that and ready for that
 

6749
02:02:40,440 --> 02:02:42,830
attentive to that and ready for that
January 6th actually should surprise us

6750
02:02:42,830 --> 02:02:42,840
January 6th actually should surprise us
 

6751
02:02:42,840 --> 02:02:45,169
January 6th actually should surprise us
not because it happened but because it

6752
02:02:45,169 --> 02:02:45,179
not because it happened but because it
 

6753
02:02:45,179 --> 02:02:47,330
not because it happened but because it

the park and that's why most countries

6780
02:03:12,649 --> 02:03:12,659
the park and that's why most countries
 

6781
02:03:12,659 --> 02:03:15,649
the park and that's why most countries
have a centralized system to manage

02:03:19,850 --> 02:03:19,860
people uh we need to think about that a
 

6787
02:03:19,860 --> 02:03:21,290
people uh we need to think about that a
lot of people don't vote because they're

to anger someone or that they're going
to be seen as politicizing an issue

6798
02:03:28,510 --> 02:03:28,520
to be seen as politicizing an issue

02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:31,729
to be seen as politicizing an issue
differences uh in 1876 there was fraud

6800
02:03:31,729 --> 02:03:31,739
differences uh in 1876 there was fraud

black people from voting and that it
helped white people go to multiple

voting booths
 

6813
02:03:42,540 --> 02:03:44,450
voting booths
uh and this was quite common in the

1880s if you went to vote uh here's how
 

6817
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:48,470
1880s if you went to vote uh here's how
it would happen in a place like Chicago

6818
02:03:48,470 --> 02:03:48,480
it would happen in a place like Chicago
 

6819
02:03:48,480 --> 02:03:51,589
it would happen in a place like Chicago
or New York the union boss from your

6820
02:03:51,589 --> 02:03:51,599
or New York the union boss from your
 

6821
02:03:51,599 --> 02:03:53,149
or New York the union boss from your
factory would come and get you at the

6822
02:03:53,149 --> 02:03:53,159
factory would come and get you at the
 

6823

factory would come and get you at the
factory

02:03:53,990 --> 02:03:54,000
factory
 

6825
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,629
factory
give you lunch get you drunk and then

6826
02:03:56,629 --> 02:03:56,639
give you lunch get you drunk and then
 

6827
02:03:56,639 --> 02:03:58,370
give you lunch get you drunk and then
drive you from one voting booth to

6828
02:03:58,370 --> 02:03:58,380
drive you from one voting booth to
 

6829
02:03:58,380 --> 02:03:59,930
drive you from one voting booth to
another and give you a ballot that you

6830
02:03:59,930 --> 02:03:59,940
another and give you a ballot that you
 

6831
02:03:59,940 --> 02:04:01,129
another and give you a ballot that you
would bring in and just and he would

6832
02:04:01,129 --> 02:04:01,139
would bring in and just and he would
 

6833
02:04:01,139 --> 02:04:03,290

sounds pretty nice not gonna lie I take

6836
02:04:06,290 --> 02:04:06,300
sounds pretty nice not gonna lie I take
 

6837
02:04:06,300 --> 02:04:08,209
sounds pretty nice not gonna lie I take
that right so that's a difference that

6838
02:04:08,209 --> 02:04:08,219
that right so that's a difference that
 

6839
02:04:08,219 --> 02:04:10,070
that right so that's a difference that
that is not how our elections work now

6840
02:04:10,070 --> 02:04:10,080
that is not how our elections work now
 

6841
02:04:10,080 --> 02:04:11,870
that is not how our elections work now
one of our Great accomplishments has

6842
02:04:11,870 --> 02:04:11,880
one of our Great accomplishments has
 

6843
02:04:11,880 --> 02:04:13,910
one of our Great accomplishments has
been to eliminate virtually all the

6844
02:04:13,910 --> 02:04:13,920
been to eliminate virtually all the
 

6845
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:15,530
been to eliminate virtually all the
fraud in our elections how have we done

6846
02:04:15,530 --> 02:04:15,540
fraud in our elections how have we done
 

6847
02:04:15,540 --> 02:04:18,410
fraud in our elections how have we done
that by creating safeguards

6848
02:04:18,410 --> 02:04:18,420
that by creating safeguards
 

6849
02:04:18,420 --> 02:04:21,649
that by creating safeguards
um it is very difficult all the evidence

6850
02:04:21,649 --> 02:04:21,659
um it is very difficult all the evidence
 

6851
02:04:21,659 --> 02:04:23,689
um it is very difficult all the evidence
we have is that the minimal fraud that's

6852
02:04:23,689 --> 02:04:23,699
we have is that the minimal fraud that's
 

6853
02:04:23,699 --> 02:04:25,189
we have is that the minimal fraud that's
occurred in elections or onesies and

6854
02:04:25,189 --> 02:04:25,199
occurred in elections or onesies and
 

6855
02:04:25,199 --> 02:04:27,830
occurred in elections or onesies and
twosies and it's never in the last 20

6856
02:04:27,830 --> 02:04:27,840
twosies and it's never in the last 20
 

6857
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:29,570
twosies and it's never in the last 20
years had any big difference in the

6858
02:04:29,570 --> 02:04:29,580
years had any big difference in the
 

6859
02:04:29,580 --> 02:04:31,250
years had any big difference in the
outcome of Elections so that's a that's

6860
02:04:31,250 --> 02:04:31,260
outcome of Elections so that's a that's
 

6861
02:04:31,260 --> 02:04:33,050
outcome of Elections so that's a that's
a big difference and then another big

6862
02:04:33,050 --> 02:04:33,060
a big difference and then another big
 

6863
02:04:33,060 --> 02:04:36,290
a big difference and then another big
difference I think is that um in that

6864
02:04:36,290 --> 02:04:36,300
difference I think is that um in that
 

6865
02:04:36,300 --> 02:04:38,330
difference I think is that um in that
time the Democrats and Republicans are

6866
02:04:38,330 --> 02:04:38,340
time the Democrats and Republicans are
 

6867
02:04:38,340 --> 02:04:39,770
time the Democrats and Republicans are
on the opposite sides of where they are

6868
02:04:39,770 --> 02:04:39,780
on the opposite sides of where they are
 

6869
02:04:39,780 --> 02:04:41,330
on the opposite sides of where they are
now and that that changes everything

6870
02:04:41,330 --> 02:04:41,340
now and that that changes everything
 

6871
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:42,770
now and that that changes everything
right so the Democrats then are the

6872
02:04:42,770 --> 02:04:42,780
right so the Democrats then are the
 

6873
02:04:42,780 --> 02:04:45,169
right so the Democrats then are the
party of the Confederacy the Democrats

6874
02:04:45,169 --> 02:04:45,179
party of the Confederacy the Democrats
 

6875
02:04:45,179 --> 02:04:46,550
party of the Confederacy the Democrats
are the party of exclusion the

6876
02:04:46,550 --> 02:04:46,560
are the party of exclusion the
 

6877
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:47,870
are the party of exclusion the
Republicans are more the party of

6878
02:04:47,870 --> 02:04:47,880
Republicans are more the party of
 

6879
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:49,609
Republicans are more the party of
economic expansion

6880
02:04:49,609 --> 02:04:49,619
economic expansion
 

6881
02:04:49,619 --> 02:04:52,129
economic expansion
uh and the Republicans are the Big Ten

6882
02:04:52,129 --> 02:04:52,139
uh and the Republicans are the Big Ten
 

6883
02:04:52,139 --> 02:04:54,770
uh and the Republicans are the Big Ten
party were reversed today do you think

6884
02:04:54,770 --> 02:04:54,780
party were reversed today do you think
 

6885
02:04:54,780 --> 02:04:57,530
party were reversed today do you think
uh because there's much less election

6886
02:04:57,530 --> 02:04:57,540
uh because there's much less election
 

6887
02:04:57,540 --> 02:04:59,089
uh because there's much less election
fraud

6888
02:04:59,089 --> 02:04:59,099
fraud
 

6889
02:04:59,099 --> 02:05:01,490
fraud
now like you described

6890
02:05:01,490 --> 02:05:01,500
now like you described
 

6891
02:05:01,500 --> 02:05:03,890
now like you described
uh one of the lessons we want to maybe

6892
02:05:03,890 --> 02:05:03,900
uh one of the lessons we want to maybe
 

6893
02:05:03,900 --> 02:05:05,990
uh one of the lessons we want to maybe
learn from that is that doesn't actually

6894
02:05:05,990 --> 02:05:06,000
learn from that is that doesn't actually
 

6895
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,209
learn from that is that doesn't actually
have to be election fraud for either

6896
02:05:08,209 --> 02:05:08,219
have to be election fraud for either
 

6897
02:05:08,219 --> 02:05:10,490
have to be election fraud for either
side to claim this election fraud it

6898
02:05:10,490 --> 02:05:10,500
side to claim this election fraud it
 

6899
02:05:10,500 --> 02:05:13,070
side to claim this election fraud it
seems like it's more and more common and

6900
02:05:13,070 --> 02:05:13,080
seems like it's more and more common and
 

6901
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:16,129
seems like it's more and more common and
it seems to me that in 2024 election in

6902
02:05:16,129 --> 02:05:16,139
it seems to me that in 2024 election in
 

6903
02:05:16,139 --> 02:05:18,890
it seems to me that in 2024 election in
the United States if a republican wins

6904
02:05:18,890 --> 02:05:18,900
the United States if a republican wins
 

6905
02:05:18,900 --> 02:05:22,990
the United States if a republican wins
that would also be uh

6906
02:05:22,990 --> 02:05:23,000
that would also be uh
 

6907
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:27,229
that would also be uh
just maybe just as likely as as uh

6908
02:05:27,229 --> 02:05:27,239
just maybe just as likely as as uh
 

6909
02:05:27,239 --> 02:05:30,050
just maybe just as likely as as uh
um if uh if a Democrat wins that there

6910
02:05:30,050 --> 02:05:30,060

there's all kinds of improvements that
 

7033
02:07:32,460 --> 02:07:34,129
there's all kinds of improvements that
are seems our system is dragging their

kind of stuff let's make this clear we
 

7039
02:07:39,060 --> 02:07:40,729
kind of stuff let's make this clear we

landlines but one could create a system
 

7143
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:32,870
landlines but one could create a system

will disagree with me this part is part

7230
02:11:06,169 --> 02:11:06,179
will disagree with me this part is part
 

7231
02:11:06,179 --> 02:11:07,729
will disagree with me this part is part
of my own ignorance of cryptocurrency

7232
02:11:07,729 --> 02:11:07,739
of my own ignorance of cryptocurrency
 

7233
02:11:07,739 --> 02:11:10,430
of my own ignorance of cryptocurrency
but I'm conservative lowercase C and the

but I'm conservative lowercase C and the
 

7235
02:11:10,440 --> 02:11:12,109
but I'm conservative lowercase C and the
way I think about fiscal issues I worry

7236
02:11:12,109 --> 02:11:12,119
way I think about fiscal issues I worry
 

7237
02:11:12,119 --> 02:11:13,310
way I think about fiscal issues I worry
about that

7238
02:11:13,310 --> 02:11:13,320
about that
 

7239
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:15,830
about that
I am a believer that there are certain

7240
02:11:15,830 --> 02:11:15,840
I am a believer that there are certain
 

7241

I am a believer that there are certain
areas where the federal government

7242
02:11:16,970 --> 02:11:16,980
areas where the federal government
 

7243
02:11:16,980 --> 02:11:18,709
areas where the federal government
should play more of a role

7244
02:11:18,709 --> 02:11:18,719
should play more of a role
 

7245
02:11:18,719 --> 02:11:20,330
should play more of a role
and there are other areas where things

7246
02:11:20,330 --> 02:11:20,340
and there are other areas where things
 

7247
02:11:20,340 --> 02:11:22,189
and there are other areas where things
should be left to the localities and so

7248
02:11:22,189 --> 02:11:22,199
should be left to the localities and so
 

7249
02:11:22,199 --> 02:11:24,050
should be left to the localities and so
sometimes that can code me one way or

7250
02:11:24,050 --> 02:11:24,060
sometimes that can code me one way or
 

7251
02:11:24,060 --> 02:11:26,209
sometimes that can code me one way or
another but I think I sound sometimes a

and I guess the question I want to ask
 

7279
02:11:54,300 --> 02:11:57,410
and I guess the question I want to ask
is you as a historian does that color

7280
02:11:57,410 --> 02:11:57,420
is you as a historian does that color
 

7281
02:11:57,420 --> 02:11:59,570
is you as a historian does that color
your perspective of History

can you do you ever catch yourself where
 

7285
02:12:03,480 --> 02:12:06,910
can you do you ever catch yourself where
maybe your uh criticism of Donald Trump

7286
02:12:06,910 --> 02:12:06,920
maybe your uh criticism of Donald Trump
 

7287
02:12:06,920 --> 02:12:09,589
maybe your uh criticism of Donald Trump
might affect how you see the Civil War

7288
02:12:09,589 --> 02:12:09,599
might affect how you see the Civil War
 

7289
02:12:09,599 --> 02:12:12,410
might affect how you see the Civil War
like as you were completely diving in

7290
02:12:12,410 --> 02:12:12,420
like as you were completely diving in
 

7291
02:12:12,420 --> 02:12:14,930
like as you were completely diving in
and looking at the Civil War are you

7292
02:12:14,930 --> 02:12:14,940
and looking at the Civil War are you
 

7293
02:12:14,940 --> 02:12:18,470
and looking at the Civil War are you
able to put aside your uh sort of the

7294
02:12:18,470 --> 02:12:18,480
able to put aside your uh sort of the
 

7295
02:12:18,480 --> 02:12:21,229
able to put aside your uh sort of the
current day political viewpoints no I'm

7296
02:12:21,229 --> 02:12:21,239
current day political viewpoints no I'm
 

7297
02:12:21,239 --> 02:12:22,729
current day political viewpoints no I'm
not I think we have to be honest that

7298
02:12:22,729 --> 02:12:22,739
not I think we have to be honest that
 

7299
02:12:22,739 --> 02:12:25,550
not I think we have to be honest that
none of us are objective we strive to be

7300
02:12:25,550 --> 02:12:25,560
none of us are objective we strive to be
 

7301
02:12:25,560 --> 02:12:26,990
none of us are objective we strive to be
nonpartisan I really liked when you said

7302
02:12:26,990 --> 02:12:27,000
nonpartisan I really liked when you said
 

7303
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,050
nonpartisan I really liked when you said
that because I think it's an aspiration

7304
02:12:29,050 --> 02:12:29,060
that because I think it's an aspiration
 

7305
02:12:29,060 --> 02:12:32,450
that because I think it's an aspiration
no one is objective we all have our

7306
02:12:32,450 --> 02:12:32,460
no one is objective we all have our
 

7307
02:12:32,460 --> 02:12:34,250
no one is objective we all have our
biases you know some people like

7308
02:12:34,250 --> 02:12:34,260
biases you know some people like
 

7309
02:12:34,260 --> 02:12:36,589
biases you know some people like
chocolate some like vanilla and it's

7310
02:12:36,589 --> 02:12:36,599
chocolate some like vanilla and it's
 

7311
02:12:36,599 --> 02:12:39,290
chocolate some like vanilla and it's
just that's just the reality right and

7312
02:12:39,290 --> 02:12:39,300
just that's just the reality right and
 

7313
02:12:39,300 --> 02:12:40,729
just that's just the reality right and
um as far as I know there's really hard

7314
02:12:40,729 --> 02:12:40,739
um as far as I know there's really hard
 

7315
02:12:40,739 --> 02:12:42,410
um as far as I know there's really hard
it's very hard even to biologically

7316
02:12:42,410 --> 02:12:42,420
it's very hard even to biologically
 

7317
02:12:42,420 --> 02:12:45,169
it's very hard even to biologically
explain that and so

7318
02:12:45,169 --> 02:12:45,179
explain that and so
 

7319
02:12:45,179 --> 02:12:46,790
explain that and so
um my view

7320
02:12:46,790 --> 02:12:46,800
um my view
 

7321
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:48,709
um my view
is that what a good historian what a

7322
02:12:48,709 --> 02:12:48,719
is that what a good historian what a
 

7323
02:12:48,719 --> 02:12:49,910
is that what a good historian what a
good scholar does I don't care what the

7324
02:12:49,910 --> 02:12:49,920
good scholar does I don't care what the
 

7325
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:52,310
good scholar does I don't care what the
field is is you're self-conscious of

7326
02:12:52,310 --> 02:12:52,320
field is is you're self-conscious of
 

7327
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:53,830
field is is you're self-conscious of
your biases

7328
02:12:53,830 --> 02:12:53,840
your biases
 

7329
02:12:53,840 --> 02:12:58,010
your biases
and you try to recognize them as you're

7330
02:12:58,010 --> 02:12:58,020
and you try to recognize them as you're
 

7331
02:12:58,020 --> 02:12:59,569
and you try to recognize them as you're
doing your research

7332
02:12:59,569 --> 02:12:59,579
doing your research
 

7333
02:12:59,579 --> 02:13:02,330
doing your research
and you make doubly certain that where

7334
02:13:02,330 --> 02:13:02,340
and you make doubly certain that where
 

7335
02:13:02,340 --> 02:13:03,950
and you make doubly certain that where
your research seems to reinforce your

7336
02:13:03,950 --> 02:13:03,960
your research seems to reinforce your
 

7337
02:13:03,960 --> 02:13:05,750
your research seems to reinforce your
biases that you actually have the

7338
02:13:05,750 --> 02:13:05,760
biases that you actually have the
 

7339
02:13:05,760 --> 02:13:07,729
biases that you actually have the
evidence to make that argument

7340
02:13:07,729 --> 02:13:07,739
evidence to make that argument
 

7341
02:13:07,739 --> 02:13:10,370
evidence to make that argument
but I still believe even doing that that

7342
02:13:10,370 --> 02:13:10,380
but I still believe even doing that that
 

7343
02:13:10,380 --> 02:13:11,569
but I still believe even doing that that
someone with a slightly different

7344
02:13:11,569 --> 02:13:11,579
someone with a slightly different
 

7345
02:13:11,579 --> 02:13:13,370
someone with a slightly different
perspective might read the same evidence

7346
02:13:13,370 --> 02:13:13,380
perspective might read the same evidence
 

7347
02:13:13,380 --> 02:13:15,229
perspective might read the same evidence
in different ways that's what makes

7348
02:13:15,229 --> 02:13:15,239
in different ways that's what makes
 

7349
02:13:15,239 --> 02:13:16,609
in different ways that's what makes
history vibrant

7350
02:13:16,609 --> 02:13:16,619
history vibrant
 

7351
02:13:16,619 --> 02:13:19,129
history vibrant
so I I wrote this book in part as I say

7352
02:13:19,129 --> 02:13:19,139
so I I wrote this book in part as I say
 

7353
02:13:19,139 --> 02:13:21,770
so I I wrote this book in part as I say
in the introduction because I was

7354
02:13:21,770 --> 02:13:21,780
in the introduction because I was
 

7355
02:13:21,780 --> 02:13:23,750
in the introduction because I was
self-critical watching Trump and the

7356
02:13:23,750 --> 02:13:23,760
self-critical watching Trump and the
 

7357
02:13:23,760 --> 02:13:26,270
self-critical watching Trump and the
things I quite frankly find deeply

7358
02:13:26,270 --> 02:13:26,280
things I quite frankly find deeply
 

7359
02:13:26,280 --> 02:13:28,189
things I quite frankly find deeply
dangerous about Donald Trump and about

7360
02:13:28,189 --> 02:13:28,199
dangerous about Donald Trump and about
 

7361
02:13:28,199 --> 02:13:30,470
dangerous about Donald Trump and about
what happened on January 6th and I found

7362
02:13:30,470 --> 02:13:30,480
what happened on January 6th and I found
 

7363
02:13:30,480 --> 02:13:33,050
what happened on January 6th and I found
I had not thought deeply enough about

7364
02:13:33,050 --> 02:13:33,060
I had not thought deeply enough about
 

7365
02:13:33,060 --> 02:13:35,270
I had not thought deeply enough about
the roots of that in our society

7366
02:13:35,270 --> 02:13:35,280
the roots of that in our society
 

7367
02:13:35,280 --> 02:13:37,129
the roots of that in our society
because I don't believe Trump or any one

7368
02:13:37,129 --> 02:13:37,139
because I don't believe Trump or any one
 

7369
02:13:37,139 --> 02:13:38,990
because I don't believe Trump or any one
figure creates these kinds of movements

7370
02:13:38,990 --> 02:13:39,000
figure creates these kinds of movements
 

7371
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:40,970
figure creates these kinds of movements
that come out of a deeper history uh

7372
02:13:40,970 --> 02:13:40,980
that come out of a deeper history uh
 

7373
02:13:40,980 --> 02:13:43,729
that come out of a deeper history uh
just a small side tangent I do believe

7374
02:13:43,729 --> 02:13:43,739
just a small side tangent I do believe
 

7375
02:13:43,739 --> 02:13:47,330
just a small side tangent I do believe
your work is non-partisan but it's also

7376
02:13:47,330 --> 02:13:47,340
your work is non-partisan but it's also
 

7377
02:13:47,340 --> 02:13:48,589
your work is non-partisan but it's also
funny

7378
02:13:48,589 --> 02:13:48,599
funny
 

7379
02:13:48,599 --> 02:13:50,390
funny
that there are a lot of people on the

7380
02:13:50,390 --> 02:13:50,400

wish I had known before
 

7435
02:14:48,900 --> 02:14:51,290
wish I had known before
um but there are moments when I use

7436
02:14:51,290 --> 02:14:51,300
um but there are moments when I use
 

7437
02:14:51,300 --> 02:14:52,550
um but there are moments when I use
words that I know are controversial

7438
02:14:52,550 --> 02:14:52,560
words that I know are controversial
 

7439
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:53,990
words that I know are controversial
because I'm trying to show there's a

7440
02:14:53,990 --> 02:14:54,000
because I'm trying to show there's a
 

7441
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:57,290
because I'm trying to show there's a
fact base behind them so white supremacy

7442
02:14:57,290 --> 02:14:57,300
fact base behind them so white supremacy
 

7443
02:14:57,300 --> 02:14:59,030
fact base behind them so white supremacy
does exist I've had people say I don't

7444
02:14:59,030 --> 02:14:59,040
does exist I've had people say I don't
 

7445
02:14:59,040 --> 02:15:00,589
does exist I've had people say I don't
think that's I think that's a

7446
02:15:00,589 --> 02:15:00,599
think that's I think that's a
 

7447
02:15:00,599 --> 02:15:02,450
think that's I think that's a
politically correct term or it's a woke

7448
02:15:02,450 --> 02:15:02,460
politically correct term or it's a woke
 

7449
02:15:02,460 --> 02:15:05,089
politically correct term or it's a woke
term it can be used in the wrong ways

7450
02:15:05,089 --> 02:15:05,099
term it can be used in the wrong ways
 

7451
02:15:05,099 --> 02:15:06,589
term it can be used in the wrong ways
one should not go around calling

7452
02:15:06,589 --> 02:15:06,599
one should not go around calling
 

7453
02:15:06,599 --> 02:15:09,589
one should not go around calling
everything one doesn't like that uh but

7454
02:15:09,589 --> 02:15:09,599
everything one doesn't like that uh but
 

7455
02:15:09,599 --> 02:15:11,689
everything one doesn't like that uh but
the Confederates were white supremacists

7456
02:15:11,689 --> 02:15:11,699
the Confederates were white supremacists
 

7457
02:15:11,699 --> 02:15:14,149
the Confederates were white supremacists
and I use that word because I think it's

7458
02:15:14,149 --> 02:15:14,159
and I use that word because I think it's
 

7459
02:15:14,159 --> 02:15:16,069
and I use that word because I think it's
an accurate descriptor and we need to

7460
02:15:16,069 --> 02:15:16,079
an accurate descriptor and we need to
 

7461
02:15:16,079 --> 02:15:18,649
an accurate descriptor and we need to
recognize that that is a part of our

7462
02:15:18,649 --> 02:15:18,659
recognize that that is a part of our
 

7463
02:15:18,659 --> 02:15:20,149
recognize that that is a part of our
history but that does trigger some

7464
02:15:20,149 --> 02:15:20,159
history but that does trigger some
 

7465
02:15:20,159 --> 02:15:23,209
history but that does trigger some
people and because that that language is

7466
02:15:23,209 --> 02:15:23,219
people and because that that language is
 

7467
02:15:23,219 --> 02:15:25,669
people and because that that language is
used to mean other things currently so

7468
02:15:25,669 --> 02:15:25,679
used to mean other things currently so
 

7469
02:15:25,679 --> 02:15:27,649
used to mean other things currently so
the the Press will take on certain terms

7470
02:15:27,649 --> 02:15:27,659
the the Press will take on certain terms
 

7471
02:15:27,659 --> 02:15:29,030
the the Press will take on certain terms
like white supremacists then label

7472
02:15:29,030 --> 02:15:29,040
like white supremacists then label
 

7473
02:15:29,040 --> 02:15:32,089
like white supremacists then label
everybody white supremacist uh like a

7474
02:15:32,089 --> 02:15:32,099
everybody white supremacist uh like a
 

7475
02:15:32,099 --> 02:15:33,470
everybody white supremacist uh like a
lot of people that basically are in the

7476
02:15:33,470 --> 02:15:33,480
lot of people that basically are in the
 

7477
02:15:33,480 --> 02:15:34,729
lot of people that basically are in the
right or something like that they use

7478
02:15:34,729 --> 02:15:34,739
right or something like that they use
 

7479
02:15:34,739 --> 02:15:37,669
right or something like that they use
this outraged language and that actually

7480
02:15:37,669 --> 02:15:37,679
this outraged language and that actually
 

7481
02:15:37,679 --> 02:15:39,350
this outraged language and that actually
ruins the ability to use the language

7482
02:15:39,350 --> 02:15:39,360
ruins the ability to use the language
 

7483
02:15:39,360 --> 02:15:42,649
ruins the ability to use the language
precisely exactly for historical that's

7484
02:15:42,649 --> 02:15:42,659
precisely exactly for historical that's
 

7485
02:15:42,659 --> 02:15:44,450
precisely exactly for historical that's
exactly right that's exactly but you do

7486
02:15:44,450 --> 02:15:44,460
exactly right that's exactly but you do
 

7487
02:15:44,460 --> 02:15:46,850
exactly right that's exactly but you do
have to unfortunately we do have to no

7488
02:15:46,850 --> 02:15:46,860
have to unfortunately we do have to no
 

7489
02:15:46,860 --> 02:15:48,169
have to unfortunately we do have to no
actually people disagree you might

7490
02:15:48,169 --> 02:15:48,179
actually people disagree you might
 

7491
02:15:48,179 --> 02:15:51,169
actually people disagree you might
disagree with this but I I tend to try

7492
02:15:51,169 --> 02:15:51,179
disagree with this but I I tend to try
 

7493
02:15:51,179 --> 02:15:53,089
disagree with this but I I tend to try
to avoid like take on the responsibility

7494
02:15:53,089 --> 02:15:53,099
to avoid like take on the responsibility
 

7495
02:15:53,099 --> 02:15:55,370
to avoid like take on the responsibility
avoiding that language

7496
02:15:55,370 --> 02:15:55,380
avoiding that language
 

7497
02:15:55,380 --> 02:15:57,050
avoiding that language
um like if the Press is using a certain

7498
02:15:57,050 --> 02:15:57,060
um like if the Press is using a certain
 

7499
02:15:57,060 --> 02:15:58,850
um like if the Press is using a certain
kind of language I try to avoid it yeah

7500
02:15:58,850 --> 02:15:58,860
kind of language I try to avoid it yeah
 

7501
02:15:58,860 --> 02:16:00,830
kind of language I try to avoid it yeah
what might what I try to do is sometimes

7502
02:16:00,830 --> 02:16:00,840
what might what I try to do is sometimes
 

7503
02:16:00,840 --> 02:16:02,089
what might what I try to do is sometimes
avoid it but where I think the language

7504
02:16:02,089 --> 02:16:02,099
avoid it but where I think the language
 

7505
02:16:02,099 --> 02:16:04,729
avoid it but where I think the language
is necessary yeah to be precise but also

7506
02:16:04,729 --> 02:16:04,739
is necessary yeah to be precise but also
 

7507
02:16:04,739 --> 02:16:06,589
is necessary yeah to be precise but also
to contextualize

7508
02:16:06,589 --> 02:16:06,599
to contextualize
 

7509
02:16:06,599 --> 02:16:09,709
to contextualize
so I don't call the confeder all

7510
02:16:09,709 --> 02:16:09,719
so I don't call the confeder all
 

7511
02:16:09,719 --> 02:16:11,750
so I don't call the confeder all
Confederates white supremacists but I

7512
02:16:11,750 --> 02:16:11,760
Confederates white supremacists but I
 

7513
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:14,689
Confederates white supremacists but I
point out where white supremacist ideas

7514
02:16:14,689 --> 02:16:14,699
point out where white supremacist ideas
 

7515
02:16:14,699 --> 02:16:16,370
point out where white supremacist ideas
have influenced them

7516
02:16:16,370 --> 02:16:16,380
have influenced them
 

7517
02:16:16,380 --> 02:16:18,050
have influenced them
right and I point out where certain

7518
02:16:18,050 --> 02:16:18,060
right and I point out where certain
 

7519
02:16:18,060 --> 02:16:19,370
right and I point out where certain
individuals are doing things that

7520
02:16:19,370 --> 02:16:19,380
individuals are doing things that
 

7521
02:16:19,380 --> 02:16:21,589
individuals are doing things that
resonate with that but I'm against these

7522
02:16:21,589 --> 02:16:21,599
resonate with that but I'm against these
 

7523
02:16:21,599 --> 02:16:24,169
resonate with that but I'm against these
kind of blanket labels and categories

7524
02:16:24,169 --> 02:16:24,179
kind of blanket labels and categories
 

7525
02:16:24,179 --> 02:16:27,430
kind of blanket labels and categories
and you also have to speak about Vice

7526
02:16:27,430 --> 02:16:27,440
and you also have to speak about Vice
 

7527
02:16:27,440 --> 02:16:30,470
and you also have to speak about Vice
supremacism in that context in a nuanced

7528
02:16:30,470 --> 02:16:30,480
supremacism in that context in a nuanced
 

7529
02:16:30,480 --> 02:16:32,450
supremacism in that context in a nuanced
way so people use white supremacist

7530
02:16:32,450 --> 02:16:32,460
way so people use white supremacist
 

7531
02:16:32,460 --> 02:16:33,889
way so people use white supremacist
without thinking what that means and

7532
02:16:33,889 --> 02:16:33,899
without thinking what that means and
 

7533
02:16:33,899 --> 02:16:35,810
without thinking what that means and
they just use it as a slower word like

7534
02:16:35,810 --> 02:16:35,820
they just use it as a slower word like
 

7535
02:16:35,820 --> 02:16:38,509
they just use it as a slower word like
this evil person but white supremacist

7536
02:16:38,509 --> 02:16:38,519

02:18:50,690 --> 02:18:50,700
trying to do it but I like the fact that
 

7659
02:18:50,700 --> 02:18:52,070
trying to do it but I like the fact that
he thinks it can be better his whole

7660

he thinks it can be better his whole
 

7661
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:53,990
he thinks it can be better his whole
argument for himself is that he can make

argument for himself is that he can make
 

7663
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,089

like the second half of that sentence
 

7669
02:18:58,920 --> 02:19:00,230
like the second half of that sentence
when he says I can make things better

7670
02:19:00,230 --> 02:19:00,240
when he says I can make things better
 

7671
02:19:00,240 --> 02:19:02,450
when he says I can make things better
take the eye out I like that can be

7672
02:19:02,450 --> 02:19:02,460
take the eye out I like that can be
 

7673
02:19:02,460 --> 02:19:03,650
take the eye out I like that can be
better because there are too many people

7674
02:19:03,650 --> 02:19:03,660
better because there are too many people
 

7675
02:19:03,660 --> 02:19:05,750
better because there are too many people
on the left and the right

accept them as they are or they're

that stands out for several reasons one
 

7843
02:22:03,600 --> 02:22:06,410
that stands out for several reasons one
in a time because we've been facing so

in a time because we've been facing so
 

7845

8091
02:26:36,840 --> 02:26:38,690
just the people because I I think about
them and I I tend to think that most

8092
02:26:38,690 --> 02:26:38,700
them and I I tend to think that most
 

8093
02:26:38,700 --> 02:26:41,270
them and I I tend to think that most
people are amazing human beings and that

8094
02:26:41,270 --> 02:26:41,280
people are amazing human beings and that
 

8095
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:43,070

world and so I just think

world and so I just think
 

8099
02:26:45,899 --> 02:26:47,510
world and so I just think
that's not a productive way of being

8100
02:26:47,510 --> 02:26:47,520
that's not a productive way of being
 

8101
02:26:47,520 --> 02:26:49,610
that's not a productive way of being
like psychologically for anything

8102
02:26:49,610 --> 02:26:49,620
like psychologically for anything
 

8103
02:26:49,620 --> 02:26:52,010
like psychologically for anything
whatsoever everybody has quirks that you

8104
02:26:52,010 --> 02:26:52,020
whatsoever everybody has quirks that you
 

8105
02:26:52,020 --> 02:26:53,929
whatsoever everybody has quirks that you
can hate but you just focus on the

8106
02:26:53,929 --> 02:26:53,939
can hate but you just focus on the
 

8107
02:26:53,939 --> 02:26:55,610
can hate but you just focus on the
really positive stuff and you celebrate

8108
02:26:55,610 --> 02:26:55,620
really positive stuff and you celebrate
 

8109
02:26:55,620 --> 02:26:57,230
really positive stuff and you celebrate
that stuff and that feels good that has

8110
02:26:57,230 --> 02:26:57,240
that stuff and that feels good that has
 

8111
02:26:57,240 --> 02:27:00,290
that stuff and that feels good that has
a momentum to it I guess the hate has a

8112
02:27:00,290 --> 02:27:00,300
a momentum to it I guess the hate has a
 

8113
02:27:00,300 --> 02:27:01,910
a momentum to it I guess the hate has a
momentum to it too and that's what I'm

8114
02:27:01,910 --> 02:27:01,920
momentum to it too and that's what I'm
 

8115
02:27:01,920 --> 02:27:03,710
momentum to it too and that's what I'm
trying to highlight if you follow the

trying to highlight if you follow the
 

8117
02:27:03,720 --> 02:27:06,170
trying to highlight if you follow the
momentum of hate that's going to maybe

8118
02:27:06,170 --> 02:27:06,180
momentum of hate that's going to maybe
 

8119
02:27:06,180 --> 02:27:08,450
momentum of hate that's going to maybe
feel good in the short term but it's not

8120
02:27:08,450 --> 02:27:08,460
feel good in the short term but it's not
 

8121
02:27:08,460 --> 02:27:10,370
feel good in the short term but it's not
it's gonna [\h__\h] you over more and more

8122
02:27:10,370 --> 02:27:10,380
it's gonna [\h__\h] you over more and more
 

8123
02:27:10,380 --> 02:27:12,230

in your life and that's you have to be
 

8125
02:27:12,240 --> 02:27:13,790
in your life and that's you have to be
cognizant of that as you interact with

cognizant of that as you interact with
 

8127
02:27:13,800 --> 02:27:15,050

02:27:18,720 --> 02:27:21,290
said but I think people who do things
that are influential and serious there

8132
02:27:21,290 --> 02:27:21,300
that are influential and serious there
 

8133
02:27:21,300 --> 02:27:23,030
that are influential and serious there
always are some people who hate them

8310
02:30:27,290 --> 02:30:27,300
it if you actually truly have a
 

8311
02:30:27,300 --> 02:30:28,550
it if you actually truly have a
conversation within the human being you

8312
02:30:28,550 --> 02:30:28,560
conversation within the human being you
 

8313
02:30:28,560 --> 02:30:31,730
conversation within the human being you
empathize it's very difficult uh because

8314
02:30:31,730 --> 02:30:31,740
empathize it's very difficult uh because
 

8315
02:30:31,740 --> 02:30:33,590
empathize it's very difficult uh because
they have a story they have a vision of

8316
02:30:33,590 --> 02:30:33,600
they have a story they have a vision of
 

8317
02:30:33,600 --> 02:30:35,630
they have a story they have a vision of
themselves that that they're the good

8318
02:30:35,630 --> 02:30:35,640
themselves that that they're the good
 

8319
02:30:35,640 --> 02:30:39,050
themselves that that they're the good
person and to call somebody a liar while

8320
02:30:39,050 --> 02:30:39,060
person and to call somebody a liar while
 

8321
02:30:39,060 --> 02:30:41,270
person and to call somebody a liar while
having empathy basically imply that

8322
02:30:41,270 --> 02:30:41,280
having empathy basically imply that
 

8323
02:30:41,280 --> 02:30:43,969
having empathy basically imply that
they're a liar that's damn damn hard uh

8324
02:30:43,969 --> 02:30:43,979
they're a liar that's damn damn hard uh
 

8325
02:30:43,979 --> 02:30:47,510
they're a liar that's damn damn hard uh
so anyway but I'm I'm well set I agree

8326
02:30:47,510 --> 02:30:47,520
so anyway but I'm I'm well set I agree
 

8327
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:49,610
so anyway but I'm I'm well set I agree
trying to figure this thing out can you

8328
02:30:49,610 --> 02:30:49,620
trying to figure this thing out can you
 

8329
02:30:49,620 --> 02:30:51,110
trying to figure this thing out can you
make the case that the January 6th

8330
02:30:51,110 --> 02:30:51,120
make the case that the January 6th
 

8331
02:30:51,120 --> 02:30:53,630
make the case that the January 6th
storming of the US capital is the big

8332
02:30:53,630 --> 02:30:53,640
storming of the US capital is the big
 

8333
02:30:53,640 --> 02:30:55,610
storming of the US capital is the big
deal and can you make the case that it

8334
02:30:55,610 --> 02:30:55,620
deal and can you make the case that it
 

8335
02:30:55,620 --> 02:30:56,990
deal and can you make the case that it
is not a big deal

8336
02:30:56,990 --> 02:30:57,000
is not a big deal
 

8337
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,570
is not a big deal
I think the case is overwhelming that it

8338
02:30:59,570 --> 02:30:59,580
I think the case is overwhelming that it
 

8339
02:30:59,580 --> 02:31:01,370
I think the case is overwhelming that it
was a big deal and I opened the book

8340
02:31:01,370 --> 02:31:01,380
was a big deal and I opened the book
 

8341
02:31:01,380 --> 02:31:03,530
was a big deal and I opened the book
with this before going back to the end

8342
02:31:03,530 --> 02:31:03,540
with this before going back to the end
 

8343
02:31:03,540 --> 02:31:04,730
with this before going back to the end
of the Civil War because I think it

8344
02:31:04,730 --> 02:31:04,740
of the Civil War because I think it
 

8345
02:31:04,740 --> 02:31:06,469
of the Civil War because I think it
echoes that moment

8346
02:31:06,469 --> 02:31:06,479
echoes that moment
 

8347
02:31:06,479 --> 02:31:09,290
echoes that moment
um you had a group of people who

8348
02:31:09,290 --> 02:31:09,300
um you had a group of people who
 

8349
02:31:09,300 --> 02:31:12,230
um you had a group of people who
um literally tried to stop

8350
02:31:12,230 --> 02:31:12,240
um literally tried to stop
 

8351
02:31:12,240 --> 02:31:14,570
um literally tried to stop
the peaceful transfer of power

8352
02:31:14,570 --> 02:31:14,580
the peaceful transfer of power
 

8353
02:31:14,580 --> 02:31:17,929
the peaceful transfer of power
and were intending and his overwhelming

8354
02:31:17,929 --> 02:31:17,939
and were intending and his overwhelming
 

8355
02:31:17,939 --> 02:31:20,510
and were intending and his overwhelming
evidence of this if they had caught the

8356
02:31:20,510 --> 02:31:20,520
evidence of this if they had caught the
 

8357
02:31:20,520 --> 02:31:23,090
evidence of this if they had caught the
vice president or the Speaker of the

8358
02:31:23,090 --> 02:31:23,100
vice president or the Speaker of the
 

8359

definition of a coup d'etat when you try

8366
02:31:31,010 --> 02:31:31,020
definition of a coup d'etat when you try
 

8367
02:31:31,020 --> 02:31:33,530
definition of a coup d'etat when you try
to capture and prevent elected officials

8368
02:31:33,530 --> 02:31:33,540
to capture and prevent elected officials
 

8369
02:31:33,540 --> 02:31:35,570
to capture and prevent elected officials
from doing their job that's a huge deal

8370
02:31:35,570 --> 02:31:35,580
from doing their job that's a huge deal
 

8371
02:31:35,580 --> 02:31:37,370
from doing their job that's a huge deal
that had happened before in our country

8372
02:31:37,370 --> 02:31:37,380
that had happened before in our country
 

8373
02:31:37,380 --> 02:31:40,250
that had happened before in our country
in States I talk about this in Louisiana

8374
02:31:40,250 --> 02:31:40,260
in States I talk about this in Louisiana
 

8375
02:31:40,260 --> 02:31:42,290
in States I talk about this in Louisiana
in Tennessee and places like that after

8376
02:31:42,290 --> 02:31:42,300
in Tennessee and places like that after
 

8377
02:31:42,300 --> 02:31:44,210
in Tennessee and places like that after
the Civil War but it never happened in

8378
02:31:44,210 --> 02:31:44,220
the Civil War but it never happened in
 

8379
02:31:44,220 --> 02:31:46,250
the Civil War but it never happened in
the capital that's a huge deal that is

8380
02:31:46,250 --> 02:31:46,260
the capital that's a huge deal that is
 

8381
02:31:46,260 --> 02:31:48,230
the capital that's a huge deal that is
if I might say that's like third what we

8382
02:31:48,230 --> 02:31:48,240
if I might say that's like third what we
 

8383
02:31:48,240 --> 02:31:49,730
if I might say that's like third what we
would think of as third world behavior

8384
02:31:49,730 --> 02:31:49,740
would think of as third world behavior
 

8385
02:31:49,740 --> 02:31:52,070
would think of as third world behavior
in our society and no offense to those

8386
02:31:52,070 --> 02:31:52,080
in our society and no offense to those
 

8387
02:31:52,080 --> 02:31:53,330
in our society and no offense to those
from other parts of the world I'm just

8388
02:31:53,330 --> 02:31:53,340
from other parts of the world I'm just
 

8389
02:31:53,340 --> 02:31:54,590
from other parts of the world I'm just
trying to make a point is how we see

8390
02:31:54,590 --> 02:31:54,600
trying to make a point is how we see
 

8391
02:31:54,600 --> 02:31:56,090
trying to make a point is how we see
that as happening somewhere else not

8392
02:31:56,090 --> 02:31:56,100
that as happening somewhere else not
 

8393
02:31:56,100 --> 02:31:58,730
that as happening somewhere else not
here that's a big [\h__\h] deal

8394
02:31:58,730 --> 02:31:58,740
here that's a big [\h__\h] deal
 

8395
02:31:58,740 --> 02:32:01,429
here that's a big [\h__\h] deal
uh the case that is not a big deal

8396
02:32:01,429 --> 02:32:01,439
uh the case that is not a big deal
 

8397
02:32:01,439 --> 02:32:03,349
uh the case that is not a big deal
I guess the case to make there is that

8398
02:32:03,349 --> 02:32:03,359
I guess the case to make there is that
 

8399
02:32:03,359 --> 02:32:04,610
I guess the case to make there is that
they didn't succeed

8400
02:32:04,610 --> 02:32:04,620
they didn't succeed
 

8401
02:32:04,620 --> 02:32:06,469
they didn't succeed
the case that is not a big deal is not

8402
02:32:06,469 --> 02:32:06,479
the case that is not a big deal is not
 

8403
02:32:06,479 --> 02:32:08,330
the case that is not a big deal is not
that their intentions were not bad I I

8404
02:32:08,330 --> 02:32:08,340
that their intentions were not bad I I
 

8405
02:32:08,340 --> 02:32:10,130
that their intentions were not bad I I
don't see how you can Define defend

8406
02:32:10,130 --> 02:32:10,140
don't see how you can Define defend
 

8407
02:32:10,140 --> 02:32:12,650
don't see how you can Define defend
their intentions the cases uh that the

8408
02:32:12,650 --> 02:32:12,660
their intentions the cases uh that the
 

8409
02:32:12,660 --> 02:32:13,790
their intentions the cases uh that the
case there's not a big deal so they're a

8410
02:32:13,790 --> 02:32:13,800
case there's not a big deal so they're a
 

8411
02:32:13,800 --> 02:32:15,349
case there's not a big deal so they're a
bunch of clowns

8412
02:32:15,349 --> 02:32:15,359
bunch of clowns
 

8413
02:32:15,359 --> 02:32:19,010
bunch of clowns
and uh yeah they broke in uh but in the

8414
02:32:19,010 --> 02:32:19,020
and uh yeah they broke in uh but in the
 

8415
02:32:19,020 --> 02:32:19,969
and uh yeah they broke in uh but in the
end once they got in there they didn't

8416
02:32:19,969 --> 02:32:19,979
end once they got in there they didn't
 

8417
02:32:19,979 --> 02:32:21,710
end once they got in there they didn't
know what to do which is true

8418
02:32:21,710 --> 02:32:21,720
know what to do which is true
 

8419
02:32:21,720 --> 02:32:24,889
know what to do which is true
and so you know I think a professional

8420
02:32:24,889 --> 02:32:24,899
and so you know I think a professional
 

8421
02:32:24,899 --> 02:32:26,990
and so you know I think a professional
couplotter would say these were the

8422
02:32:26,990 --> 02:32:27,000
couplotter would say these were the
 

8423
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:28,070
couplotter would say these were the
amateurs

8424
02:32:28,070 --> 02:32:28,080
amateurs
 

8425
02:32:28,080 --> 02:32:29,990
amateurs
and that they had no real chance of

8426
02:32:29,990 --> 02:32:30,000
and that they had no real chance of
 

8427
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,630
and that they had no real chance of
succeeding because once they got into

8428
02:32:32,630 --> 02:32:32,640
succeeding because once they got into
 

8429
02:32:32,640 --> 02:32:34,190
succeeding because once they got into
the capital they had no plan what to do

8430
02:32:34,190 --> 02:32:34,200
the capital they had no plan what to do
 

8431
02:32:34,200 --> 02:32:35,450
the capital they had no plan what to do
next what were they going to do you know

8432
02:32:35,450 --> 02:32:35,460
next what were they going to do you know
 

8433
02:32:35,460 --> 02:32:38,630
next what were they going to do you know
steal stapler from Nancy Pelosi's office

8434
02:32:38,630 --> 02:32:38,640
steal stapler from Nancy Pelosi's office
 

8435
02:32:38,640 --> 02:32:40,670
steal stapler from Nancy Pelosi's office
they didn't seem to have a plan and what

8436
02:32:40,670 --> 02:32:40,680
they didn't seem to have a plan and what
 

8437
02:32:40,680 --> 02:32:42,710
they didn't seem to have a plan and what
ended up happening they they left the

8438
02:32:42,710 --> 02:32:42,720
ended up happening they they left the
 

8439
02:32:42,720 --> 02:32:44,690
ended up happening they they left the
building would that that would be the

8440
02:32:44,690 --> 02:32:44,700
building would that that would be the
 

8441
02:32:44,700 --> 02:32:47,690
building would that that would be the
case that's not a big deal because their

8442
02:32:47,690 --> 02:32:47,700
case that's not a big deal because their
 

8443
02:32:47,700 --> 02:32:50,570
case that's not a big deal because their
intention was not to overthrow their

8444
02:32:50,570 --> 02:32:50,580
intention was not to overthrow their
 

8445
02:32:50,580 --> 02:32:53,270
intention was not to overthrow their
intention was to protest because if the

8446
02:32:53,270 --> 02:32:53,280
intention was to protest because if the
 

8447
02:32:53,280 --> 02:32:54,710
intention was to protest because if the
intention was to overthrow would be much

8448
02:32:54,710 --> 02:32:54,720
intention was to overthrow would be much
 

8449
02:32:54,720 --> 02:32:56,210
intention was to overthrow would be much
more organized I think the evidence is

8450
02:32:56,210 --> 02:32:56,220
more organized I think the evidence is
 

8451
02:32:56,220 --> 02:32:57,650
more organized I think the evidence is
pretty overwhelming that they intended

8452
02:32:57,650 --> 02:32:57,660
pretty overwhelming that they intended
 

8453
02:32:57,660 --> 02:32:59,870
pretty overwhelming that they intended
to to stop they were there to stop the

8454
02:32:59,870 --> 02:32:59,880
to to stop they were there to stop the
 

8455
02:32:59,880 --> 02:33:01,309
to to stop they were there to stop the
certification of the election they were

02:33:08,630 --> 02:33:08,640
Cops
 

8465
02:33:08,640 --> 02:33:11,210
Cops
so you're saying there is some POS like

8466
02:33:11,210 --> 02:33:11,220
so you're saying there is some POS like
 

8467
02:33:11,220 --> 02:33:13,550
so you're saying there is some POS like
statistically some possibility that this

8468
02:33:13,550 --> 02:33:13,560
statistically some possibility that this
 

8469
02:33:13,560 --> 02:33:14,690
statistically some possibility that this
would have

8470
02:33:14,690 --> 02:33:14,700
would have
 

8471
02:33:14,700 --> 02:33:17,030
would have
succeeded at halting the basic process

8472
02:33:17,030 --> 02:33:17,040
succeeded at halting the basic process
 

8473
02:33:17,040 --> 02:33:18,710
succeeded at halting the basic process
of democracy you could imagine a

8474
02:33:18,710 --> 02:33:18,720
of democracy you could imagine a
 

8475
02:33:18,720 --> 02:33:19,849
of democracy you could imagine a
scenario where it might have if they had

8476
02:33:19,849 --> 02:33:19,859
scenario where it might have if they had
 

8477
02:33:19,859 --> 02:33:21,830
scenario where it might have if they had
gotten lucky sure if they had if they

8478
02:33:21,830 --> 02:33:21,840
gotten lucky sure if they had if they
 

8479
02:33:21,840 --> 02:33:23,330
gotten lucky sure if they had if they
had caught the vice president

8480
02:33:23,330 --> 02:33:23,340
had caught the vice president
 

8481
02:33:23,340 --> 02:33:25,250
had caught the vice president
but what could have if they caught the

8482
02:33:25,250 --> 02:33:25,260
but what could have if they caught the
 

8483
02:33:25,260 --> 02:33:26,630
but what could have if they caught the
vice president they couldn't go on and

8484
02:33:26,630 --> 02:33:26,640
vice president they couldn't go on and
 

8485
02:33:26,640 --> 02:33:28,490
vice president they couldn't go on and
certify then he has to be there yeah but

8486
02:33:28,490 --> 02:33:28,500
certify then he has to be there yeah but
 

8487
02:33:28,500 --> 02:33:29,690
certify then he has to be there yeah but
don't you think that would resolve

8488
02:33:29,690 --> 02:33:29,700
don't you think that would resolve
 

8489
02:33:29,700 --> 02:33:31,610
don't you think that would resolve
itself through police action and so on

8490
02:33:31,610 --> 02:33:31,620
itself through police action and so on
 

8491
02:33:31,620 --> 02:33:34,610
itself through police action and so on
my question is how much how much is this

8492
02:33:34,610 --> 02:33:34,620
my question is how much how much is this
 

8493
02:33:34,620 --> 02:33:36,410
my question is how much how much is this
individual Hooligans

8494
02:33:36,410 --> 02:33:36,420
individual Hooligans
 

8495
02:33:36,420 --> 02:33:38,330
individual Hooligans
and how much of this is a gigantic

8496
02:33:38,330 --> 02:33:38,340
and how much of this is a gigantic
 

8497
02:33:38,340 --> 02:33:40,730
and how much of this is a gigantic
movement that's challenging the very

8498
02:33:40,730 --> 02:33:40,740
movement that's challenging the very
 

8499
02:33:40,740 --> 02:33:42,889
movement that's challenging the very
fabric well it's not a gigantic movement

8500
02:33:42,889 --> 02:33:42,899
fabric well it's not a gigantic movement
 

8501
02:33:42,899 --> 02:33:45,590
fabric well it's not a gigantic movement
but it was a small coup d'etat that

8502
02:33:45,590 --> 02:33:45,600
but it was a small coup d'etat that
 

8503
02:33:45,600 --> 02:33:47,270
but it was a small coup d'etat that
could have actually made the transition

8504
02:33:47,270 --> 02:33:47,280
could have actually made the transition
 

8505
02:33:47,280 --> 02:33:48,710
could have actually made the transition
much more difficult was there a scenario

8506
02:33:48,710 --> 02:33:48,720
much more difficult was there a scenario
 

8507
02:33:48,720 --> 02:33:49,910
much more difficult was there a scenario
where Donald Trump stayed in office

8508
02:33:49,910 --> 02:33:49,920
where Donald Trump stayed in office
 

8509
02:33:49,920 --> 02:33:52,610
where Donald Trump stayed in office
legitimately no but was there a scenario

8510
02:33:52,610 --> 02:33:52,620
legitimately no but was there a scenario
 

8511
02:33:52,620 --> 02:33:54,889
legitimately no but was there a scenario
where they created a great deal of chaos

8512
02:33:54,889 --> 02:33:54,899
where they created a great deal of chaos
 

8513
02:33:54,899 --> 02:33:56,750
where they created a great deal of chaos
that further undermine our democracy

8514
02:33:56,750 --> 02:33:56,760
that further undermine our democracy
 

8515
02:33:56,760 --> 02:33:58,190
that further undermine our democracy
actually yes here's how it would happen

8516
02:33:58,190 --> 02:33:58,200
actually yes here's how it would happen
 

8517
02:33:58,200 --> 02:34:01,130
actually yes here's how it would happen
right they capture Pence right they

8518
02:34:01,130 --> 02:34:01,140
right they capture Pence right they
 

8519
02:34:01,140 --> 02:34:03,889
right they capture Pence right they
either kidnap him and try to Ransom him

8520
02:34:03,889 --> 02:34:03,899
either kidnap him and try to Ransom him
 

8521
02:34:03,899 --> 02:34:05,870
either kidnap him and try to Ransom him
or they which is what they were trying

8522
02:34:05,870 --> 02:34:05,880
or they which is what they were trying
 

8523
02:34:05,880 --> 02:34:06,889
or they which is what they were trying
to do with the Michigan governor

8524
02:34:06,889 --> 02:34:06,899
to do with the Michigan governor
 

8525
02:34:06,899 --> 02:34:09,950
to do with the Michigan governor
governor Whitmer or they kill him and

8526
02:34:09,950 --> 02:34:09,960
governor Whitmer or they kill him and
 

8527
02:34:09,960 --> 02:34:11,690
governor Whitmer or they kill him and
then Donald Trump says okay well there's

8528
02:34:11,690 --> 02:34:11,700
then Donald Trump says okay well there's
 

8529
02:34:11,700 --> 02:34:13,429
then Donald Trump says okay well there's
no vice president so you can't certify

8530
02:34:13,429 --> 02:34:13,439
no vice president so you can't certify
 

8531
02:34:13,439 --> 02:34:15,590
no vice president so you can't certify
the Senate would choose someone else to

8532
02:34:15,590 --> 02:34:15,600
the Senate would choose someone else to
 

8533
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:17,150
the Senate would choose someone else to
be vice president but Donald Trump says

8534
02:34:17,150 --> 02:34:17,160
be vice president but Donald Trump says
 

8535
02:34:17,160 --> 02:34:18,410
be vice president but Donald Trump says
no that's not legitimate I think it's

8536
02:34:18,410 --> 02:34:18,420
no that's not legitimate I think it's
 

8537
02:34:18,420 --> 02:34:19,910
no that's not legitimate I think it's
possible Donald Trump would say

8538
02:34:19,910 --> 02:34:19,920
possible Donald Trump would say
 

8539
02:34:19,920 --> 02:34:21,889
possible Donald Trump would say
something like that absolutely

8540
02:34:21,889 --> 02:34:21,899
something like that absolutely
 

8541
02:34:21,899 --> 02:34:24,889
something like that absolutely
I disagree with you he said that morning

8542
02:34:24,889 --> 02:34:24,899
I disagree with you he said that morning
 

8543
02:34:24,899 --> 02:34:27,290
I disagree with you he said that morning
that Penn should not certify he said

8544
02:34:27,290 --> 02:34:27,300
that Penn should not certify he said
 

8545
02:34:27,300 --> 02:34:28,610
that Penn should not certify he said
that morning but there's a difference

8546
02:34:28,610 --> 02:34:28,620
that morning but there's a difference
 

8547
02:34:28,620 --> 02:34:30,950
that morning but there's a difference
between sort of Twitter rhetoric no no

8548
02:34:30,950 --> 02:34:30,960
between sort of Twitter rhetoric no no
 

8549
02:34:30,960 --> 02:34:33,410
between sort of Twitter rhetoric no no
he said it at a rally sure rally

8550
02:34:33,410 --> 02:34:33,420
he said it at a rally sure rally
 

8551
02:34:33,420 --> 02:34:36,410
he said it at a rally sure rally
rhetoric and there is a threshold it

8552
02:34:36,410 --> 02:34:36,420
rhetoric and there is a threshold it
 

8553
02:34:36,420 --> 02:34:38,330
rhetoric and there is a threshold it
feels like a big leap he asked people

8554
02:34:38,330 --> 02:34:38,340
feels like a big leap he asked people
 

8555
02:34:38,340 --> 02:34:40,730
feels like a big leap he asked people
around him in the Oval Office how he

8556
02:34:40,730 --> 02:34:40,740
around him in the Oval Office how he
 

8557
02:34:40,740 --> 02:34:42,710
around him in the Oval Office how he
could make that happen he tried to get a

8558
02:34:42,710 --> 02:34:42,720
could make that happen he tried to get a
 

8559
02:34:42,720 --> 02:34:44,389
could make that happen he tried to get a
new person appointed attorney general

8560
02:34:44,389 --> 02:34:44,399
new person appointed attorney general
 

8561
02:34:44,399 --> 02:34:46,849
new person appointed attorney general
who would do that he tried to find legal

8562
02:34:46,849 --> 02:34:46,859
who would do that he tried to find legal
 

8563
02:34:46,859 --> 02:34:49,610
who would do that he tried to find legal
justification for it I I think the

8564
02:34:49,610 --> 02:34:49,620
justification for it I I think the
 

8565
02:34:49,620 --> 02:34:52,550
justification for it I I think the
evidence is overwhelming that Trump was

8566
02:34:52,550 --> 02:34:52,560
evidence is overwhelming that Trump was
 

8567
02:34:52,560 --> 02:34:55,490
evidence is overwhelming that Trump was
supportive of efforts after the election

8568
02:34:55,490 --> 02:34:55,500
supportive of efforts after the election
 

8569
02:34:55,500 --> 02:34:57,830
supportive of efforts after the election
didn't go the way he wanted to keep him

8570
02:34:57,830 --> 02:34:57,840
didn't go the way he wanted to keep him
 

8571
02:34:57,840 --> 02:34:59,090
didn't go the way he wanted to keep him
in office

8572
02:34:59,090 --> 02:34:59,100
in office
 

8573
02:34:59,100 --> 02:35:01,550
in office
and and whether that's legally

8574
02:35:01,550 --> 02:35:01,560
and and whether that's legally
 

8575
02:35:01,560 --> 02:35:03,950
and and whether that's legally
actionable and whether one thinks that

8576
02:35:03,950 --> 02:35:03,960
actionable and whether one thinks that
 

8577
02:35:03,960 --> 02:35:06,110
actionable and whether one thinks that
means he's a bad president or not isn't

8578
02:35:06,110 --> 02:35:06,120
means he's a bad president or not isn't
 

8579
02:35:06,120 --> 02:35:09,710
means he's a bad president or not isn't
a matter of opinion but facts are facts

8580
02:35:09,710 --> 02:35:09,720
a matter of opinion but facts are facts
 

8581
02:35:09,720 --> 02:35:11,809
a matter of opinion but facts are facts
yeah I just wonder if it's possible for

8582
02:35:11,809 --> 02:35:11,819
yeah I just wonder if it's possible for
 

8583
02:35:11,819 --> 02:35:13,730
yeah I just wonder if it's possible for
him to have stayed president in this in

8584
02:35:13,730 --> 02:35:13,740
him to have stayed president in this in
 

8585
02:35:13,740 --> 02:35:15,230
him to have stayed president in this in
this kind of context you know he seems

8586
02:35:15,230 --> 02:35:15,240
this kind of context you know he seems
 

8587
02:35:15,240 --> 02:35:16,370
this kind of context you know he seems
like a heated just like you said

either but I think the criticism that he
didn't protect the employees is one

8764
02:38:38,210 --> 02:38:38,220
didn't protect the employees is one
 

8765
02:38:38,220 --> 02:38:40,250
didn't protect the employees is one
thing but the employees in this case are

8766
02:38:40,250 --> 02:38:40,260
thing but the employees in this case are
 

8767
02:38:40,260 --> 02:38:42,469
thing but the employees in this case are
the ones carrying out democracy so it's

02:38:42,469 --> 02:38:42,479
the ones carrying out democracy so it's

I think you're right but I think that's

9228
02:47:04,370 --> 02:47:04,380
I think you're right but I think that's
 

9229
02:47:04,380 --> 02:47:07,130
I think you're right but I think that's
more talk than action in my experience

9230
02:47:07,130 --> 02:47:07,140
more talk than action in my experience
 

9231
02:47:07,140 --> 02:47:09,530
more talk than action in my experience
there is especially among young men

9232
02:47:09,530 --> 02:47:09,540
there is especially among young men
 

9233
02:47:09,540 --> 02:47:11,929
there is especially among young men
you're absolutely right there is a

9234
02:47:11,929 --> 02:47:11,939
you're absolutely right there is a
 

9235
02:47:11,939 --> 02:47:14,330
you're absolutely right there is a
valorization of the tough guy

9236
02:47:14,330 --> 02:47:14,340
valorization of the tough guy
 

9237
02:47:14,340 --> 02:47:17,929
valorization of the tough guy
because most men 18 and 19 are still not

9238
02:47:17,929 --> 02:47:17,939
because most men 18 and 19 are still not
 

9239
02:47:17,939 --> 02:47:19,490
because most men 18 and 19 are still not
fully comfortable in their masculinity

9240
02:47:19,490 --> 02:47:19,500
fully comfortable in their masculinity
 

9241
02:47:19,500 --> 02:47:21,889
fully comfortable in their masculinity
however they're going to Define it and

9242
02:47:21,889 --> 02:47:21,899
however they're going to Define it and
 

9243
02:47:21,899 --> 02:47:25,490
however they're going to Define it and
so a way of of Performing that is being

9244
02:47:25,490 --> 02:47:25,500
so a way of of Performing that is being
 

9245
02:47:25,500 --> 02:47:27,530
so a way of of Performing that is being
extreme in one way or another and and

9246
02:47:27,530 --> 02:47:27,540
extreme in one way or another and and
 

9247
02:47:27,540 --> 02:47:29,809
extreme in one way or another and and
I've definitely seen that but I think

9248
02:47:29,809 --> 02:47:29,819
I've definitely seen that but I think
 

9249
02:47:29,819 --> 02:47:32,690
I've definitely seen that but I think
it's it's more often than not rhetoric

9250
02:47:32,690 --> 02:47:32,700
it's it's more often than not rhetoric
 

9251
02:47:32,700 --> 02:47:34,190
it's it's more often than not rhetoric
and actually

9252
02:47:34,190 --> 02:47:34,200
and actually
 

9253
02:47:34,200 --> 02:47:37,010
and actually
there's a very strong power of peer

9254
02:47:37,010 --> 02:47:37,020
there's a very strong power of peer
 

9255
02:47:37,020 --> 02:47:38,450
there's a very strong power of peer
pressure and Conformity that works on

9256
02:47:38,450 --> 02:47:38,460
pressure and Conformity that works on
 

9257
02:47:38,460 --> 02:47:40,670
pressure and Conformity that works on
young people and the positive side of

9258
02:47:40,670 --> 02:47:40,680
young people and the positive side of
 

9259
02:47:40,680 --> 02:47:43,670
young people and the positive side of
that now is the peer pressure among them

9260
02:47:43,670 --> 02:47:43,680
that now is the peer pressure among them
 

9261
02:47:43,680 --> 02:47:45,650
that now is the peer pressure among them
is not to join one party or the other

9262
02:47:45,650 --> 02:47:45,660
is not to join one party or the other
 

9263
02:47:45,660 --> 02:47:47,330
is not to join one party or the other
it's to say this is this is terrible

9264
02:47:47,330 --> 02:47:47,340
it's to say this is this is terrible
 

9265
02:47:47,340 --> 02:47:49,250
it's to say this is this is terrible
look at how our parents are screwing

9266
02:47:49,250 --> 02:47:49,260
look at how our parents are screwing
 

9267
02:47:49,260 --> 02:47:52,429
look at how our parents are screwing
things up and they're right and I think

9268
02:47:52,429 --> 02:47:52,439
things up and they're right and I think
 

9269
02:47:52,439 --> 02:47:54,710
things up and they're right and I think
we can lean into that and get a lot of

9270
02:47:54,710 --> 02:47:54,720
we can lean into that and get a lot of
 

9271
02:47:54,720 --> 02:47:57,770
we can lean into that and get a lot of
positive creative action uh out of that

9272
02:47:57,770 --> 02:47:57,780
positive creative action uh out of that
 

9273
02:47:57,780 --> 02:47:59,690
positive creative action uh out of that
on universities you brought this up a

9274
02:47:59,690 --> 02:47:59,700
on universities you brought this up a
 

9275
02:47:59,700 --> 02:48:01,610
on universities you brought this up a
few times and and I think we have to be

9276
02:48:01,610 --> 02:48:01,620
few times and and I think we have to be
 

9277
02:48:01,620 --> 02:48:03,530
few times and and I think we have to be
careful I think you and I agree on this

9278
02:48:03,530 --> 02:48:03,540
careful I think you and I agree on this
 

9279
02:48:03,540 --> 02:48:04,670
careful I think you and I agree on this
um it's not that universities are free

9280
02:48:04,670 --> 02:48:04,680
um it's not that universities are free
 

9281
02:48:04,680 --> 02:48:06,889
um it's not that universities are free
of bias the universities especially

9282
02:48:06,889 --> 02:48:06,899
of bias the universities especially
 

9283
02:48:06,899 --> 02:48:09,230
of bias the universities especially
large universities whether it's UT MIT

9284
02:48:09,230 --> 02:48:09,240
large universities whether it's UT MIT
 

9285
02:48:09,240 --> 02:48:11,510
large universities whether it's UT MIT
Yale whatever we're talking about right

9286
02:48:11,510 --> 02:48:11,520
Yale whatever we're talking about right
 

9287
02:48:11,520 --> 02:48:14,530
Yale whatever we're talking about right
uh they're large complex Empires

9288
02:48:14,530 --> 02:48:14,540
uh they're large complex Empires
 

9289
02:48:14,540 --> 02:48:17,809
uh they're large complex Empires
and most universities people in the Arts

9290
02:48:17,809 --> 02:48:17,819
and most universities people in the Arts
 

9291
02:48:17,819 --> 02:48:19,670
and most universities people in the Arts
tend to be a little left of center at

9292
02:48:19,670 --> 02:48:19,680
tend to be a little left of center at
 

9293
02:48:19,680 --> 02:48:20,809
tend to be a little left of center at
self-selection

9294
02:48:20,809 --> 02:48:20,819
self-selection
 

9295
02:48:20,819 --> 02:48:22,730
self-selection
those in engineering tend to be pretty

9296
02:48:22,730 --> 02:48:22,740
those in engineering tend to be pretty
 

9297
02:48:22,740 --> 02:48:24,770
those in engineering tend to be pretty
much in the middle and those at Business

9298
02:48:24,770 --> 02:48:24,780
much in the middle and those at Business
 

9299
02:48:24,780 --> 02:48:26,929
much in the middle and those at Business
Schools tend to be right of Center

9300
02:48:26,929 --> 02:48:26,939
Schools tend to be right of Center
 

9301
02:48:26,939 --> 02:48:28,910
Schools tend to be right of Center
and so I think we need to be careful not

9302
02:48:28,910 --> 02:48:28,920
and so I think we need to be careful not
 

9303
02:48:28,920 --> 02:48:31,070
and so I think we need to be careful not
to to generalize

9304
02:48:31,070 --> 02:48:31,080
to to generalize
 

9305
02:48:31,080 --> 02:48:32,330
to to generalize
um you know at the University of Texas

9306
02:48:32,330 --> 02:48:32,340
um you know at the University of Texas
 

9307
02:48:32,340 --> 02:48:34,429
um you know at the University of Texas
there's as much influence from the

9308
02:48:34,429 --> 02:48:34,439
there's as much influence from the
 

9309
02:48:34,439 --> 02:48:35,630
there's as much influence from the
business school and the athletic

9310
02:48:35,630 --> 02:48:35,640
business school and the athletic
 

9311
02:48:35,640 --> 02:48:37,490
business school and the athletic
department as there is from the

9312
02:48:37,490 --> 02:48:37,500
department as there is from the
 

9313
02:48:37,500 --> 02:48:40,910
department as there is from the
humanities uh so it's not a left-leaning

9314
02:48:40,910 --> 02:48:40,920
humanities uh so it's not a left-leaning
 

9315
02:48:40,920 --> 02:48:43,250
humanities uh so it's not a left-leaning
campus and that's also true at at Yale

9316
02:48:43,250 --> 02:48:43,260
campus and that's also true at at Yale
 

9317
02:48:43,260 --> 02:48:44,570
campus and that's also true at at Yale
you have the School of Management and

9318
02:48:44,570 --> 02:48:44,580
you have the School of Management and
 

9319
02:48:44,580 --> 02:48:46,730
you have the School of Management and
you know you have a huge uh medical

9320
02:48:46,730 --> 02:48:46,740
you know you have a huge uh medical
 

9321
02:48:46,740 --> 02:48:48,650
you know you have a huge uh medical
school right people who are very

9322
02:48:48,650 --> 02:48:48,660
school right people who are very
 

9323
02:48:48,660 --> 02:48:51,110
school right people who are very
professional uh and less political on a

9324
02:48:51,110 --> 02:48:51,120
professional uh and less political on a
 

9325
02:48:51,120 --> 02:48:52,910
professional uh and less political on a
lot of these issues so so I think we

9326
02:48:52,910 --> 02:48:52,920
lot of these issues so so I think we
 

9327
02:48:52,920 --> 02:48:53,750
lot of these issues so so I think we
have to be careful I think there's

9328
02:48:53,750 --> 02:48:53,760
have to be careful I think there's
 

9329
02:48:53,760 --> 02:48:55,610
have to be careful I think there's
certain pockets of things

9330
02:48:55,610 --> 02:48:55,620
certain pockets of things
 

9331
02:48:55,620 --> 02:48:57,290
certain pockets of things
but some of that you're never going to

9332
02:48:57,290 --> 02:48:57,300
but some of that you're never going to
 

9333
02:48:57,300 --> 02:48:59,389
but some of that you're never going to
avoid right Engineers are always going

9334
02:48:59,389 --> 02:48:59,399
avoid right Engineers are always going
 

9335
02:48:59,399 --> 02:49:02,929
avoid right Engineers are always going
to be the people who hey now what do you

9336
02:49:02,929 --> 02:49:02,939
to be the people who hey now what do you
 

9337
02:49:02,939 --> 02:49:05,570
to be the people who hey now what do you
I'm sure who who who want to generally

9338
02:49:05,570 --> 02:49:05,580
I'm sure who who who want to generally
 

9339
02:49:05,580 --> 02:49:08,090
I'm sure who who who want to generally
find some objective measure and avoid

9340
02:49:08,090 --> 02:49:08,100
find some objective measure and avoid
 

9341
02:49:08,100 --> 02:49:09,650
find some objective measure and avoid
political interpretation right they want

9342
02:49:09,650 --> 02:49:09,660
political interpretation right they want
 

9343
02:49:09,660 --> 02:49:11,450
political interpretation right they want
to find their objective measure I'm

9344
02:49:11,450 --> 02:49:11,460
to find their objective measure I'm
 

9345
02:49:11,460 --> 02:49:13,309
to find their objective measure I'm
surprised of how most people in like

9346
02:49:13,309 --> 02:49:13,319
surprised of how most people in like
 

9347
02:49:13,319 --> 02:49:14,929
surprised of how most people in like
robotics don't seem to they're afraid of

9348
02:49:14,929 --> 02:49:14,939
robotics don't seem to they're afraid of
 

9349
02:49:14,939 --> 02:49:16,630
robotics don't seem to they're afraid of
humans they run away from you precisely

humans they run away from you precisely
 

9351
02:49:16,640 --> 02:49:19,429
humans they run away from you precisely
precisely and and the Arts people are

9352
02:49:19,429 --> 02:49:19,439
precisely and and the Arts people are
 

9353
02:49:19,439 --> 02:49:21,110
precisely and and the Arts people are
always going to be more touchy-feely and

9354
02:49:21,110 --> 02:49:21,120
always going to be more touchy-feely and
 

9355
02:49:21,120 --> 02:49:22,070
always going to be more touchy-feely and
the business people are always going to

02:49:22,070 --> 02:49:22,080
the business people are always going to
 

9357
02:49:22,080 --> 02:49:24,290
the business people are always going to
like markets I mean my own personal

9358
02:49:24,290 --> 02:49:24,300
like markets I mean my own personal
 

9359
02:49:24,300 --> 02:49:27,650
like markets I mean my own personal
opinion on this is uh this is just me

9360
02:49:27,650 --> 02:49:27,660
opinion on this is uh this is just me
 

9361
02:49:27,660 --> 02:49:28,550

talking
 

9363
02:49:28,560 --> 02:49:30,530
talking
yeah and it's I don't know if it's

9364
02:49:30,530 --> 02:49:30,540
yeah and it's I don't know if it's
 

9365
02:49:30,540 --> 02:49:32,450
yeah and it's I don't know if it's
grounded in data but just my own

9366
02:49:32,450 --> 02:49:32,460
grounded in data but just my own
 

9367
02:49:32,460 --> 02:49:35,210
grounded in data but just my own
experiences it seems a lot of the things

9368
02:49:35,210 --> 02:49:35,220
experiences it seems a lot of the things
 

9369
02:49:35,220 --> 02:49:36,830
experiences it seems a lot of the things
that people criticize about universities

9370
02:49:36,830 --> 02:49:36,840
that people criticize about universities
 

9371
02:49:36,840 --> 02:49:38,690
that people criticize about universities
comes from administrations from the

9372
02:49:38,690 --> 02:49:38,700
comes from administrations from the
 

9373
02:49:38,700 --> 02:49:40,550
comes from administrations from the
bureaucracies the faculty and the

9374
02:49:40,550 --> 02:49:40,560
bureaucracies the faculty and the
 

9375
02:49:40,560 --> 02:49:44,150
bureaucracies the faculty and the
students are even with biases are really

9376
02:49:44,150 --> 02:49:44,160
students are even with biases are really
 

9377
02:49:44,160 --> 02:49:46,070
students are even with biases are really
interesting people and all of their

9378
02:49:46,070 --> 02:49:46,080
interesting people and all of their
 

9379
02:49:46,080 --> 02:49:47,690
interesting people and all of their
different I wouldn't call them biases

9380
02:49:47,690 --> 02:49:47,700
different I wouldn't call them biases
 

9381
02:49:47,700 --> 02:49:49,969
different I wouldn't call them biases
but different perspectives add to the

9382
02:49:49,969 --> 02:49:49,979
but different perspectives add to the
 

9383
02:49:49,979 --> 02:49:52,550
but different perspectives add to the
conversation it's the administrator too

9384
02:49:52,550 --> 02:49:52,560
conversation it's the administrator too
 

9385
02:49:52,560 --> 02:49:54,050
conversation it's the administrator too
much of course you need just like with

9386
02:49:54,050 --> 02:49:54,060
much of course you need just like with
 

9387
02:49:54,060 --> 02:49:56,630
much of course you need just like with
institutions you need some but too much

9388
02:49:56,630 --> 02:49:56,640
institutions you need some but too much
 

9389
02:49:56,640 --> 02:49:59,570
institutions you need some but too much
it becomes too heavy-handed and

9390
02:49:59,570 --> 02:49:59,580
it becomes too heavy-handed and
 

9391
02:49:59,580 --> 02:50:02,330
it becomes too heavy-handed and
um somehow that has been getting a

9392
02:50:02,330 --> 02:50:02,340
um somehow that has been getting a
 

9393
02:50:02,340 --> 02:50:03,889
um somehow that has been getting a
little bit out of hand at a bunch of

9394
02:50:03,889 --> 02:50:03,899
little bit out of hand at a bunch of
 

9395
02:50:03,899 --> 02:50:05,330
little bit out of hand at a bunch of
universities just too much too much

9396
02:50:05,330 --> 02:50:05,340
universities just too much too much
 

9397
02:50:05,340 --> 02:50:07,130
universities just too much too much
Administration and I don't know what the

9398
02:50:07,130 --> 02:50:07,140
Administration and I don't know what the
 

9399
02:50:07,140 --> 02:50:09,050
Administration and I don't know what the
mechanism is to let to make it more

more than 20 000 people who are part of

is still in the present and I think
that's a recurring theme in our in our

about woes to the world it's actually
 

9497
02:51:53,340 --> 02:51:55,309
about woes to the world it's actually
about taking issues we take a topic each

9498
02:51:55,309 --> 02:51:55,319
about taking issues we take a topic each
 

9499
02:51:55,319 --> 02:51:57,050
about taking issues we take a topic each
week that's in the news we go back to

9501
02:51:57,060 --> 02:51:59,090
week that's in the news we go back to
understand the history and we then use

9502
02:51:59,090 --> 02:51:59,100
understand the history and we then use
 

9503
02:51:59,100 --> 02:52:00,769
understand the history and we then use
that history to make better policy to

9504
02:52:00,769 --> 02:52:00,779
that history to make better policy to
 

9505
02:52:00,779 --> 02:52:02,269
that history to make better policy to
