1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,410
- The following is a
conversation with Eric Weinstein.

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,340
He's a mathematician, economist,

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,760
physicist and the managing
director of Thiel Capital.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,960
He coined the term and you could say,

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,410
is the founder of the
Intellectual Dark Web,

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,370
which is a loosely assembled
group of public intellectuals

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,980
that includes Sam Harris,
Jordan Peterson, Steven Pinker,

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,990
Joe Rogan, Michael
Shermer and a few others.

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,240
This conversation is part of
the artificial intelligence

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,270
podcast at MIT and Beyond.

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,420
spelled F-R-I-D.

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,463
And now, here's my conversation
with Eric Weinstein.

15
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,360
- Are you nervous about this?

16
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,260
- Scared shitless.

17
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,470
- Okay, (speaking foreign language).

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,550
- You mention Kung Fu Panda as
one of your favorite movies.

19
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,040
It has the usual profound
master student dynamic going on,

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,240
so who has been a teacher
that significantly influenced

21
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,930
the direction of your
thinking and life's work?

22
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,700
So, if you're the Kung Fu
Panda, who was your Shifu?

23
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,533
- Oh, well that's interesting,

24
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:12,160
because I didn't see Shifu
as being the teacher.

25
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,830
- Who was the teacher?

26
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,070
- Oogway, Master Oogway, the turtle.

27
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,170
- Oh, the turtle, right.

28
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,840
- They only meet twice in the entire film

29
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,003
and the first conversation
sort of doesn't count.

30
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,410
So, they magic of the
film, in fact, it's point

31
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,110
is that the teaching that
really matters is transferred

32
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,090
during a single conversation
and it's very brief.

33
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,700
And so, who played that role in my life?

34
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,700
I would say either my
grandfather, Harry Rubin

35
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:54,053
and his wife Sophie Rubin,
my grandmother or Tom Lehrer.

36
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,283
- Tom Lehrer?
- Yeah.

37
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,163
- In which way?

38
00:01:58,163 --> 00:02:01,430
- If you give a child Tom Lehrer records,

39
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,250
what you do is you destroy their ability

40
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,253
to be taken over by later malware,

41
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:13,090
and it's so irreverent, so
witty, so clever, so obscene,

42
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,780
that it destroys the ability

43
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,360
to lead a normal life for many people.

44
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,360
So if I meet somebody who's
usually really shifted

45
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,160
from any kind of neuro
typical presentation,

46
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,710
I'll often ask them,
are you a Tom Lehrer fan

47
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:34,160
and the odds that they will
respond are quite high.

48
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,590
- Now Tom Lehrer is Poisoning
Pigeons in the Park,

49
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,210
Tom Lehrer?
- That's very interesting.

50
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,440
There are a small number
of Tom Lehrer songs

51
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,840
that broke into the general population.

52
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,260
Poisoning Pigeons in the Park,

53
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,683
the Element Song and
perhaps the Vatican Rag.

54
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,500
So, when you meet somebody
who knows those songs,

55
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,610
but doesn't know--

56
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,680
- Oh, you're judging me
right now, aren't you?

57
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,060
- Harshly.
- Okay.

58
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,470
- No, but you're Russian, so.
- Yes.

59
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,330
- Undoubtedly you know
Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky.

60
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,960
That song.
- Yes, yeah, yup.

61
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,840
- So that was a song about plagiarism

62
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,560
that was in fact plagiarized,

63
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,860
which most people don't
know, from Danny Kaye.

64
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,680
Where Danny Kaye did a song called

65
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,000
Stanislavsky of the musky arts.

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,300
And, so Tom Lehrer did this brilliant job

67
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,970
of plagiarizing a song and
making it about plagiarism,

68
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,540
and then making it about
this mathematician,

69
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,830
who worked in Non-Euclidean geometry.

70
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,570
That was like giving heroin to a child.

71
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,770
It was extremely addictive and eventually

72
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,570
led me to a lot of different places.

73
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,570
One of which may have
been PhD in mathematics.

74
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,610
- And he was also at least
a lecturer in mathematics,

75
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,720
I believe at Harvard, something like that?

76
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,750
- Yeah, I just had
dinner with him, in fact.

77
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,480
When my son turned 13, we didn't tell him,

78
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,770
but his Bar mitzvah present was dinner

79
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,370
with his hero, Tom Lehrer,

80
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,810
and Tom Lehrer was 88
years old, sharp as a tack,

81
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:03,350
irreverent and funny as
hell and just, you know,

82
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,610
there are very few people in this world

83
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,700
that you have to meet
while they're still here

84
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,290
and that was definitely
one for our family.

85
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:14,290
- So that wit is a
reflection of intelligence

86
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,800
in some kind of deep way.

87
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,770
Like where that would be a good test

88
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,230
of intelligence whether
you're a Tom Lehrer fan.

89
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,760
So, what do you think that is about wit?

90
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,220
About that kind of humor,

91
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,120
ability to see the absurdity in existence?

92
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,640
Do you think that's connected
to intelligence or are we just

93
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,720
two Jews on a mic that
appreciate that kind of humor.

94
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,690
- No, I think that it's absolutely

95
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:37,970
connected to intelligence.

96
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,890
You can see it, there's a
place where Tom Lehrer decides

97
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:45,840
that he's going to lampoon
Gilbert of Gilbert and Sullivan

98
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,870
and he's going to out
due Gilbert with clever,

99
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,940
meaningless wordplay and he has,

100
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,030
I forget the, well let's see.

101
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,980
He's doing Clementine as if
Gilbert and Sullivan wrote it

102
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,410
and he says that I missed her,

103
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,720
depressed her young sister named Esther.

104
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,160
This mister to pester she'd tried.

105
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,700
A pestering sister's a festering blister

106
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,510
you're best to resist her, say I!

107
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,040
The sister persisted, the mister resisted,

108
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,253
I kissed her, all loyalty slipped.

109
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:08,440
When she said I could have
her her sister's cadaver

110
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,600
must surely have turned in its crypt.

111
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,870
That's so dense.

112
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,810
It's so insane.
- Yeah.

113
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,530
- That that's clearly intelligence because

114
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,540
it's hard to construct
something like that.

115
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:24,540
If I look at my favorite
Tom Lehrer lyric, you know,

116
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,930
there's a perfectly absurd one which is,

117
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,820
once all the German's
were warlike and mean,

118
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,240
but that couldn't happen again.

119
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,040
We taught them a lesson in 1918

120
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,150
and they've hardly bothered us since then.

121
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,440
- Right.
- That is a different

122
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,870
kind of intelligence.

123
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,810
You know, you're taking
something that is so horrific

124
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,210
and you're sort of making
it palatable and funny,

125
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:48,120
and demonstrating also just your humanity.

126
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,850
I mean, I think the thing that
came through as Tom Lehrer

127
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,240
wrote all of these
terrible, horrible lines,

128
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,060
was just what a sensitive
and beautiful soul he was,

129
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,883
who was channeling pain through
humor and through grace.

130
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,960
- I've seen throughout
Europe, throughout Russia,

131
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,200
the same kind of humor emerged

132
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,240
from the generation of World War II.

133
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,240
It seemed like that humor
is required to somehow deal

134
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,010
with the pain and the suffering
of that that war created.

135
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,940
- Well, you do need the environment

136
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,750
to create the broad Slavic soul.

137
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:24,530
I don't think that many
Americans really appreciate

138
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,900
Russian humor, how you had
to joke during the time

139
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,870
of let's say, Article 58 under Stalin.

140
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,660
You had to be very, very careful.

141
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,540
You know, the concept of a
Russian satirical magazine,

142
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,410
like Krokodil, doesn't make sense.

143
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:45,770
So you have this cross
cultural problem that there

144
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,140
are certain areas of human
experience that it would

145
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,470
be better to know nothing
about and quite unfortunately,

146
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,670
eastern Europe knows a
great deal about them,

147
00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:00,033
which makes the songs of
Vladimir Voevodsky so potent.

148
00:07:01,606 --> 00:07:04,290
You know, the prose of
Pushkin, whatever it is.

149
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:08,100
You have to appreciate the
depth of the Eastern European

150
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,740
experience and I would think
that perhaps Americans knew

151
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,590
something like this around
the time of the Civil War

152
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:19,700
or maybe under slavery and Jim Crow

153
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,700
or even the harsh tyranny of the coal

154
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:28,293
and steel employers during the labor wars.

155
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:33,040
But in general I would say,
it's hard for us to understand

156
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,080
and imagine the collective culture,

157
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,470
unless we have the system
of selective pressures,

158
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,563
that for example, Russians
were subjected to.

159
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,750
- Yeah, so if there's one good
thing that comes outta war,

160
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:51,750
it's literature, art and humor and music.

161
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,380
- Oh, I don't think so. I
think almost everything is good

162
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,040
about war except for
death and destruction.

163
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,873
- Right.

164
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,690
Without the death it would
bring the romance of it,

165
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,523
the whole thing is nice but--

166
00:08:03,523 --> 00:08:05,057
- Well, this is why we're
always caught up in war.

167
00:08:05,057 --> 00:08:08,350
We have this very ambiguous
relationship to it,

168
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:12,800
is that it makes life real
and pressing and meaningful,

169
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,870
and at an unacceptable price

170
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,780
and the price has never been higher.

171
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:22,253
- So to jump into AI a little bit,

172
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,860
in one of the conversations
you had or one of the videos,

173
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,980
you described that one of the
things AI systems can't do

174
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,930
and biological systems
can is self replicate

175
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:34,960
in the physical world.

176
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,960
- [Eric] Oh, no, no.

177
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,040
- In the physical world.

178
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,410
- Well, yes.

179
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:43,029
The physical robots can't self replicate,

180
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:46,900
but there's a very tricky point,

181
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,570
which is that the only
thing that we've been able

182
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,720
to create that's really
complex that has an analog

183
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,340
of our reproductive system is software.

184
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:01,880
- But, nevertheless,
software replicates itself,

185
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,090
if we're speaking strictly
for the replication

186
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,110
is this kinda digital space.

187
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,690
So let me, just to begin,
let me ask a question.

188
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,410
Do you see a protective barrier or a gap

189
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,260
between the physical world
and the digital world?

190
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,440
- Let's not call it digital.

191
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,753
Let's call it the logical world
versus the physical world.

192
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,840
- Why logical?

193
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,170
- Well, because even though we had,

194
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,423
let's say Einstein's brain preserved,

195
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,850
it was meaningless to
us as a physical object

196
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,150
because we couldn't do anything with

197
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,580
what was stored in it at a logical level.

198
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,450
And so, the idea that something
may be stored logically

199
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:43,450
and that it may be stored
physically, are not necessarily,

200
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,740
we don't always benefit from synonymizing.

201
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,150
I'm not suggesting that
there isn't a material basis

202
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:52,320
to the logical world,
but that it does warrant

203
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,080
identification with a separate layer that

204
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,080
need not invoke logic
gates and zeros and ones.

205
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,420
- And, so connecting those two worlds,

206
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,770
the logical world and the
physical world or maybe

207
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:08,650
just connecting to the logical
world inside our brain,

208
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,650
Einstein's brain, you mention
the idea of outtelligence.

209
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,500
- [Eric] Artificial outtelligence.

210
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,690
- Artificial outtelligence.
- Yes, this is the only essay

211
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,800
that John Brockman every
invited me to write

212
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,045
that he refused to publish in Edge.

213
00:10:24,045 --> 00:10:25,560
(Lex chuckling)

214
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,790
- Why?

215
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:30,440
- Well, maybe it wasn't well
written, but I don't know.

216
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,500
- The idea is quite compelling.

217
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,230
It's quite unique and new, at
least from my stance point.

218
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,310
Maybe you can explain it?

219
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,520
- Sure.

220
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,620
What I was thinking about is
why it is that we're waiting

221
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:47,300
to be terrified by artificial
general intelligence.

222
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:52,300
When in fact, artificial
life is terrifying

223
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,530
in and of itself and it's already here.

224
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,820
So, in order to have a system
of selective pressures,

225
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,210
you need three distinct elements.

226
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:04,350
You need variation within a population,

227
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,473
you need heritability, and
you need differential success.

228
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,000
So, what's really unique
and I've made this point,

229
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I think elsewhere, about software,

230
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,970
is that if you think about what humans

231
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,320
know how to build that's impressive.

232
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,960
So, I always take a car
and I say does it have

233
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,520
an analog of each of the
physiological systems?

234
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,880
Does it have a skeletal
structure, that's its frame.

235
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,160
Does it have a neurological structure,

236
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,590
it has an onboard computer.

237
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,773
It has a digestive system.

238
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,420
The one thing it doesn't have
is a reproductive system.

239
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:42,950
But if you can call spawn on a process,

240
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,250
effectively you do have
a reproductive system.

241
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,720
And that means that you
can create something

242
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,380
with variation, heritability
and differential success.

243
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,780
Now, the next step in
the chain of thinking

244
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,780
was where do we see inanimate
non intelligent life

245
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,373
outwitting intelligent life?

246
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,150
And I have two favorite
systems and I try to stay

247
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,370
on them so that we don't get distracted.

248
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:16,370
One of which is the Ophrys
orchid sub species or sub clave,

249
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,853
I don't what to call it.

250
00:12:17,853 --> 00:12:20,290
- Is that a type of flower?
- Yeah, it's a type of flower

251
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:23,480
that mimics the female
of a pollinator species

252
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,580
in order to dupe the males
into engaging in what

253
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,610
is called pseudocopulation,
with the fake female,

254
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,730
which is usually represented
by the lowest pedal,

255
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,450
and there's also a pheromone
component to fool the males

256
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,990
into thinking they have
a mating opportunity.

257
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,090
But the flower doesn't have
to give up energy in the form

258
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:44,093
of nectar as a lure, because
it's tricking the males.

259
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:50,300
The other system is a
particular species of muscle,

260
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,600
lampsilis in the clear streams
of Missouri and it fools bass

261
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,900
into biting a fleshy lip that
contain its young and when

262
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,070
the bass see this fleshy
lip, which looks exactly like

263
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,880
a species of fish that
the bass like to eat,

264
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,410
the young explode and clamp
onto the gills and parasitize

265
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,620
the bass and also use
the bass to redistribute

266
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,343
them as they eventually release.

267
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:24,450
Both of these systems, you
have a highly intelligent dupe,

268
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,143
being fooled by a lower life form.

269
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:34,530
And what is sculpting
these convincing lures?

270
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:37,160
It's the intelligence of previously

271
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,470
duped targets for these strategies.

272
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,803
So when the target is smart
enough to avoid the strategy,

273
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,680
those weaker mimics fall off,
they have terminal lines,

274
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,730
and only the better ones survive.

275
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:56,610
So it's an arms race
between the target species

276
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:00,910
that is being parasitized,
getting smarter,

277
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,220
and this other less intelligent

278
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,063
or non intelligent object
getting as if smarter.

279
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,250
And so, what you see is,
is that artificial general

280
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,130
intelligence is not
needed to parasitize us.

281
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:22,060
It's simply sufficient for
us to outwit ourselves,

282
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,230
so you could have a program, let's say,

283
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:28,230
one of these Nigerian
scams that writes letters

284
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:33,230
and uses whoever sends it
Bitcoin to figure out which

285
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,800
aspects of the program should be kept,

286
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,740
which should be varied and thrown away,

287
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,280
and you don't need it to
be in anyway intelligent

288
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,740
in order to have a really
nightmare scenario being

289
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,650
parasitized by something that
has no idea what it's doing.

290
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,330
- So you phrased a few
concepts really eloquently,

291
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:53,110
so let me try to, there's
a few directions this goes.

292
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:56,910
So one, first of all, in the
way we write software today,

293
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:01,160
it's not common that we
allow it to self modify.

294
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,850
- But we do have that ability now.

295
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,261
- We have the ability.
- It's just not common.

296
00:15:05,261 --> 00:15:07,045
- I just isn't common.

297
00:15:07,045 --> 00:15:11,260
So your thought is that that is

298
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,147
a serious worry if there becomes--

299
00:15:15,295 --> 00:15:18,450
- But self modifying
code is available now.

300
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,070
- So there's different types
of self modification right?

301
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:24,990
There's personalization,
you know your email app,

302
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:29,990
your Gmail is self modifying
to you after you login

303
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,320
or whatever, you can think of that way.

304
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,240
But ultimately it's central,
all the information is

305
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,000
centralized, but you're
thinking of ideas where you're,

306
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,110
this is a unique entity operating under

307
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,910
selective pressures and it changes--

308
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,810
- Well, you just, if you
think about the fact that our

309
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:53,640
immune systems don't know
what's coming at them next,

310
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,750
but they have a small set
of spanning components,

311
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:02,710
and if it's a sufficiently
expressive system in that any

312
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:07,710
shape or binding region can
be approximated with the Lego

313
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,670
that is present, then
you can have confidence

314
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,850
that you don't need to
know what's coming at you

315
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:20,010
because the combinatorics are sufficient

316
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,303
to reach any configuration needed.

317
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,880
- So that's a beautiful, well
terrifying thing to worry

318
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,830
about because it's so within our reach.

319
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,550
- Whenever I suggest
these things I do always

320
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,670
have a concern as to whether
or not I will bring them

321
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,930
into being by talking about them.

322
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:41,930
- So there's this thing
from OpenAI next week,

323
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,010
to talk to the founder of OpenAI,

324
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,023
this idea that their text generation,

325
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:52,140
the new stuff they have
for generating text is,

326
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,400
they didn't wanna bring it,
they didn't wanna release

327
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,520
it because they're about the--

328
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,910
- I'm delighted to hear that,

329
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,670
but they're going to end up releasing.

330
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:04,180
- Yes, that's the thing is
I think talking about it,

331
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,270
well at least from my end,

332
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:09,643
I'm more a proponent of
technology preventing,

333
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,050
so further innovation preventing

334
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,460
the detrimental effects of innovation.

335
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,680
- Well we're in a, we're
sort of tumbling down

336
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,230
a hill at accelerating speed.

337
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,525
So, whether or not we're proponents or--

338
00:17:24,525 --> 00:17:26,820
- It doesn't really matter.
- It may not matter.

339
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,300
- But I.
- Well, may not.

340
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,910
- Well, I do feel that there are people

341
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:32,920
who have held things back and you know,

342
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,350
died poorer than they
might have otherwise been.

343
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,450
We don't even know their names.

344
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:41,110
I don't think that we should
discount the idea that having

345
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:45,270
the smartest people showing
off how smart they are by what

346
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,930
they've developed may
be a terminal process.

347
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:55,420
I'm very mindful in particular
of a beautiful letter that

348
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,350
Edward Teller of all
people wrote to Leo Szilard

349
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,360
where Szilard was trying to
figure out how to control the

350
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:05,360
use of atomic weaponry at the
end of World War II and Teller

351
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:09,083
rather strangely, because many
of us view him as a monster,

352
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:14,280
showed some very advanced
moral thinking talking about

353
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,420
the slim chance we have for survival

354
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,520
and that the only hope is
to make war unthinkable.

355
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,140
I do think that not enough
of us feel in our gut,

356
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,570
what it is we are playing
with when we are working on

357
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:28,500
technical problems, and I
would recommend to anyone who

358
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,180
hasn't seen it, a movie called
A Bridge on the River Kwai,

359
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,710
about I believe captured British POWs

360
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,000
who just in a desire to do a bridge well,

361
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,110
end up over collaborating
with their Japanese captors.

362
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,660
- Well, now you're making me question

363
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:50,273
the unrestricted open
discussion of ideas and AI.

364
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,600
- I'm not saying I know the answer,

365
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,870
I'm just saying that I
could make a decent case

366
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,860
for either our need to talk about this and

367
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,700
to become technologically
focused on containing it

368
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:05,347
or need to stop talking about
this and try to hope that

369
00:19:05,347 --> 00:19:08,610
the relatively small number
of highly adept individuals

370
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,120
who are looking at these
problems is small enough that

371
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,010
we should in fact be talking
about how to contain it.

372
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,540
- Well, the way ideas, the
way innovation happens,

373
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:20,320
what new ideas develop,
Newton with calculus.

374
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,320
Whether if he was silent, the
idea would emerge elsewhere,

375
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,750
well in case of Newton, of course,

376
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,880
but you know, in case of
AI, how small is this set of

377
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,803
individuals out of which
such ideas would arise?

378
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,970
Is it in question--
- Well, the ideas of

379
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,710
the researchers we know and
those that we don't know.

380
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:44,620
Who may live in countries
that don't wish us to know

381
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,200
what level they're currently
at and are very disciplined

382
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,520
in keeping these things to themselves.

383
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,910
Of course, I will point out that there

384
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:56,910
is a religious school in
Kerala that developed something

385
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,510
very close to the calculus,
certainly in terms of infinite

386
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:05,510
series in, I guess religious prayer

387
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,360
and rhyme and prose.

388
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,790
So, you know, it's not
that Newton had any ability

389
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,460
to hold that back and
I don't really believe

390
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,670
that we have an ability to hold back.

391
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,980
I do think that we could change
the proportion of the time

392
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,380
we spend worrying about
the effects of what

393
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,840
if we are successful, rather
than simply trying to succeed

394
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,300
and hope that we'll be able
to contain things later.

395
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,190
- Beautifully put.

396
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:32,593
So, on the idea of
outtelligence, what form,

397
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,550
treading cautiously 'cause we've agreed

398
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,590
as we tumbled down the hill.

399
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,090
What form--
- Can't stop ourselves can we?

400
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:40,923
- We cannot.

401
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,500
What form do you see it taking?

402
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,500
So one example, Facebook,
Google, do want to,

403
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,240
I don't know a better
word, you want to influence

404
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,820
users to behave a certain way.

405
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,630
And so that's one kind of
example of outtelligence,

406
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,520
is systems perhaps modifying the behavior

407
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,070
of these intelligent human beings in order

408
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,660
to sell more product of different kind.

409
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,910
But do you see other examples
of this actually emerging in?

410
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,830
- Just take any parasitic
system, you know?

411
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:18,820
Make sure that there's some
way in which that there's

412
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,630
differential success,
heritability and variation,

413
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:27,450
and those are the magic ingredients.

414
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,300
And if you really wanted to
build a nightmare machine,

415
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,050
make sure that the system
that expresses the variability

416
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:39,030
has a spanning set, so that it
can learn to arbitrary levels

417
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,800
by making it sufficiently expressive.

418
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,170
That's your nightmare.

419
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,300
- So, it's your nightmare,
but it could also be,

420
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:50,240
it's a really powerful
mechanism by which to create,

421
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,290
well, powerful systems.

422
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:57,130
So, are you more worried
about the negative direction

423
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:59,040
that might go versus the positive?

424
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,760
So, you said parasitic, but
that doesn't necessarily

425
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,110
need to be what the
system converges towards.

426
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,639
It could be, what is it, symbiotic--

427
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:10,640
- Well, parasitism, the
dividing line between parasitism

428
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,630
and symbiosis is not so clear.

429
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,120
- [Lex] That's what they
tell me about marriage.

430
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,360
I'm still single, so I don't know.

431
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,813
- Well, yeah I do.

432
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:23,870
Would could go into that
too, but um. (Lex laughing)

433
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,960
No, I think we have to
appreciate, you know,

434
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,540
are you infected by your own mitochondria?

435
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,373
- Right.

436
00:22:35,507 --> 00:22:36,990
Yeah.
- Right, so in marriage

437
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,930
you fear the loss of independence,

438
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:42,680
but even though the American
therapeutic community

439
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,170
may be very concerned about co-dependence,

440
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:48,110
what's to say that co-dependence
isn't what's necessary

441
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:52,170
to have a stable relationship
in which to raise children

442
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,850
who are maximally K-selected and require

443
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,040
incredible amounts of care,

444
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,640
because you have to wait 13 years before

445
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,450
there's any reproductive
payout and most of us

446
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,790
don't want our 13 year olds having kids.

447
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,590
That's a very tricky situation to analyze.

448
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:09,590
I would say that predators
and parasites drive much

449
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,010
of our evolution and I don't know whether

450
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,950
to be angry at them or thank them.

451
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:17,620
- Well, ultimately, I mean,
nobody knows the meaning of life

452
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:21,250
or what even happiness is,
but there is some metrics--

453
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:24,270
- Oh, they didn't tell you?
- They didn't, they didn't.

454
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,620
That's why all the poetry
and books are bought.

455
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,710
You know, there are
some metrics under which

456
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:32,290
you can kinda measure how good it is that

457
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,940
these AI systems are roaming about.

458
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:39,940
So, you're more nervous
about software than you

459
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:44,990
are optimistic about ideas
of self replicating larceny?

460
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,563
- I don't think we've
really felt where we are.

461
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,380
You know, occasionally we get a wake up.

462
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:58,080
9/11 was so anomalous
compared to everything else

463
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,290
we've experienced on American
soil, that it came to us

464
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,980
as a complete shock that
that was even a possibility.

465
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,220
What it really was, was a
highly creative and determined

466
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:13,220
RND team deep in the bowels
of Afghanistan showing

467
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:17,410
us that we had certain
exploits that we were open to,

468
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,430
that nobody had chosen to express.

469
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,820
I can think of several of
these things that I don't talk

470
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,610
about publicly, that
just seem to have to do

471
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:29,610
with how relatively unimaginative
those who wish to cause

472
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,020
havoc and destruction
have been up until now.

473
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,363
The great mystery of our time,

474
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:40,160
of this particular little era,

475
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:45,160
is how remarkably stable
we've been since 1945 when we

476
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:50,250
demonstrated the ability to
use nuclear weapons in anger.

477
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:55,250
And, we don't know why things like

478
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,320
that haven't happened since then.

479
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,830
We've had several close
calls, we've had mistakes,

480
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:05,170
we've had brinkmanship and
what's now happened is that

481
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:10,170
we've settled into a sense that
oh, it'll always be nothing.

482
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:15,500
It's been so long since
something was at that level

483
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:20,790
of danger, that we've got
a wrong idea in our head

484
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:23,040
and that's why when I went
on the Ben Shapiro Show,

485
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,470
I talked about the need to
resume above ground testing

486
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:29,300
of nuclear devices because
we have people whose

487
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,920
developmental experience
suggests that when,

488
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:37,240
let's say Donald Trump and
North Korea engage on Twitter,

489
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,980
oh it's nothing, it's just
posturing, everybody's just

490
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,560
in it for money, there's
a sense that people are in

491
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:48,560
a video game mode, which has
been the right call since 1945.

492
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,330
We've been mostly in video game mode.

493
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:52,500
It's amazing.

494
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,200
- So you're worried about a generation

495
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,040
which has not seen any existential--

496
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,750
- We've lived under it.

497
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,300
See, you're younger.

498
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:04,140
I don't know if, and again,
you came from Moscow.

499
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,800
- [Lex] From, yeah.

500
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,610
- There was a TV show called
The Day After that had

501
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:14,610
a huge effect on a generation
growing up in the US,

502
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,540
and it talked about what life would be

503
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,433
like after a nuclear exchange.

504
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:24,530
We have not gone through
an embodied experience

505
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:27,450
collectively where we've
thought about this,

506
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,690
and I think it's one of
the most irresponsible

507
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,740
things that the elders among us have done,

508
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:36,340
which is to provide this beautiful garden

509
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:42,300
in which the thorns are
cut off of the rosebushes

510
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:47,760
and all of the edges
are rounded and sanded,

511
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,910
and so people have developed
this totally unreal idea

512
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,940
which is everything is
going to be just fine.

513
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,190
And do I think that my
leading concern is AGI

514
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:01,890
or my leading concern is
thermonuclear exchange

515
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,110
or gene drives or any one of these things?

516
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,660
I don't know.

517
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:10,660
But I know that our time here
in this very long experiment

518
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,400
here is finite, because
the toys that we've built

519
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,730
are so impressive and
the wisdom to accompany

520
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:19,000
them has not materialized.

521
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And I think we actually got
a wisdom uptick since 1945.

522
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:27,710
We had a lot of dangerous,
skilled players on the world

523
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:31,640
stage who nevertheless, no
matter how bad they were,

524
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:36,083
managed to not embroil us in something

525
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:38,210
that we couldn't come back from.

526
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:40,310
- The Cold War.
- Yeah, and the distance

527
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:45,163
from the Cold War, you
know, I'm very mindful of,

528
00:27:46,689 --> 00:27:49,130
there was a Russian tradition, actually,

529
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:53,380
of on your wedding day going to visit

530
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,760
a memorial to those who gave their lives.

531
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,340
Can you imagine this?

532
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,260
Where on the happiest day of your life,

533
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:04,400
you go and you pay homage
to the people who fought

534
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,563
and died in the Battle of Stalingrad?

535
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,810
I'm not a huge fan of
communism, I gotta say,

536
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:15,120
but there were a couple of
things that the Russians did

537
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,800
that were really positive
in the Soviet era,

538
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,350
and I think trying to let people know

539
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:25,180
how serious life actually
is, is the Russian model

540
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:28,420
of seriousness is better
than the American model.

541
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,650
- And maybe, like you mentioned,

542
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:34,546
there was a small echo
of that after 9/11, but--

543
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,140
- We wouldn't let it form.

544
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,040
We talk about 9/11, but it's 9/12

545
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,630
that really moved the needle.

546
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:44,773
When we were all just there
and nobody wanted to speak.

547
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,310
We witnessed something super serious

548
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:53,310
and we didn't want to run to our computers

549
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:57,933
and blast out our deep
thoughts and our feelings.

550
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:03,470
And it was profound because
we woke up, briefly,

551
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:07,370
and I talk about the gated
institutional narrative

552
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,060
that sort of programs our lives,

553
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,930
I've seen it break three times in my life.

554
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:15,020
One of which was the
election of Donald Trump,

555
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,700
another time was the
fall of Lehman Brothers,

556
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,950
when everybody who knew that
Bear Stearns wasn't that

557
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:26,950
important, knew that Lehman
Brothers met AIG was next,

558
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,330
and the other one was 9/11.

559
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:33,560
And so, if I'm 53 years old
and I only remember three times

560
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,310
that the global narrative
was really interrupted,

561
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,950
that tells you how much we've been

562
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:43,217
on top of developing events, you know?

563
00:29:43,217 --> 00:29:45,710
We had the Murrah Federal
Building explosion,

564
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,680
but it didn't cause
the narrative to break,

565
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,980
it wasn't profound enough.

566
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:53,963
Around 9/12, we started to
wake up out of our slumber,

567
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,960
and the powers that be, did
not want a coming together.

568
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,663
You know, the admonition was go shopping.

569
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,580
- The powers that be,
so what is that force?

570
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,840
As opposed to blaming individuals--

571
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,140
- We don't know.
- So whatever that--

572
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,270
- Whatever that force is.

573
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,417
- In silence.
- There's a component of it

574
00:30:12,417 --> 00:30:14,230
that's emergent and there's a component

575
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,100
of it that's deliberate.

576
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,700
So, give yourself a portfolio
with two components.

577
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,980
Some amount of it is
emergent, but some amount of

578
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:25,300
it is also an understanding
that if people come together,

579
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,640
they become an incredible force.

580
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,500
And what you're seeing
right now, I think is,

581
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,740
there are forces that are
trying to come together

582
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,823
and there are forces that are
trying to push things apart,

583
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,890
and you know, one of them
is the globalist narrative

584
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,330
versus the national narrative.

585
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:47,430
Where to the globalist perspective,

586
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:50,130
the nations are bad things in essence.

587
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,930
That they're temporary,
they're nationalistic,

588
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:55,500
they're jingoistic, it's all negative,

589
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,810
to people more in the national
idiom, they're saying look,

590
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:00,640
this is where I pay my taxes,

591
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,590
this is where I do my army service,

592
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,290
this is where I have a vote,

593
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:05,820
this is where I have a passport.

594
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,940
Who the hell are you to tell
me that because you've moved

595
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,770
into some place that you
can make money globally,

596
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,130
that you've chosen to abandon other people

597
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,720
to whom you have a
special and elevated duty.

598
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,970
And I think that these
competing narratives have been

599
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:24,170
pushing towards the global
perspective from the elite

600
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:26,650
and a larger and larger
number of disenfranchised

601
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:30,420
people are saying, hey, I
actually live in a place

602
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:33,370
and I have laws and I speak
a language, I have a culture,

603
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:36,680
and who are you to tell me
that because you can profit

604
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:41,020
in some far away land, that
my obligations to my fellow

605
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,250
countrymen are so much diminished.

606
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,370
- So these tensions
between nations and so on,

607
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,640
ultimately you see being proud
of your country and so on,

608
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,440
which creates potentially the kind

609
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,660
of things that led to wars and so on.

610
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:57,370
They ultimately, it is human
nature and it is good for us,

611
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:59,085
for wake up calls of different kinds.

612
00:31:59,085 --> 00:32:01,170
- Well, I think that these are tensions.

613
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:04,090
And my point isn't, I mean nationalism run

614
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,580
amuck is a nightmare.

615
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,740
And internationalism run
amuck is a nightmare.

616
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:14,740
And the problem is we're
trying to push these pendulums

617
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,210
to some place where
they're somewhat balanced.

618
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:23,210
Where we have a higher duty
of care to those who share our

619
00:32:23,731 --> 00:32:26,810
laws and our citizenship,
but we don't forget

620
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:29,253
our duties of care to the global system.

621
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,760
I would think this is elementary,

622
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:37,760
but the problem that we're
facing concerns the ability for

623
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:43,050
some to profit by abandoning
their obligations to others

624
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,580
within their system and that's
what we've had for decades.

625
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,240
- You mention nuclear weapons.

626
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,310
I was hoping to get answers
from you since one of the many

627
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,930
things you've done as economics,

628
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,650
maybe you can understand human behavior

629
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:01,070
of why the heck we haven't
blown each other up yet.

630
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,660
But okay, so we'll get--

631
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,213
- I don't know the answer.
- Yeah.

632
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,720
It's really important to say
that we really don't know--

633
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,580
- [Eric] A mild uptick in wisdom.

634
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:13,510
- A mild uptick in wisdom,
Steven Pinker who I've talked

635
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:17,940
with has a lot of really good
ideas about why, but he--

636
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,876
- I don't trust his optimism.

637
00:33:19,876 --> 00:33:22,220
(Lex chuckling)

638
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,150
- Listen, I'm Russian,
so I never trust a guy

639
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:24,983
who's that optimistic--

640
00:33:24,983 --> 00:33:27,430
- No, no, no, it's just
that you're talking about

641
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:31,710
a guy who's looking at a
system in which more and more

642
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:35,790
of the kinetic energy, like
war, has been turned into

643
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,370
potential energy like
unused nuclear weapons.

644
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:40,720
- Wow, beautifully put.
- And you know now I'm looking

645
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,350
at that system and I'm saying, okay,

646
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,240
well if you don't have
a potential energy trim,

647
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,980
then everything's just
getting better and better.

648
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:49,150
- Yeah, yeah, wow, that's beautifully put.

649
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:51,380
Only a physicist could, okay.

650
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,161
- [Eric] I'm not a physicist.

651
00:33:53,161 --> 00:33:55,350
- Well, is that a dirty word?

652
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,830
- [Eric] No, no, I wish
I were a physicist.

653
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,310
- Me too, my dad's a physicist.

654
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,700
I'm trying to live up to that probably

655
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,900
for the rest of my life.

656
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:05,090
He's probably gonna
listen to this too, so.

657
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:07,340
- Hey dad.
- Yeah, (chuckling).

658
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,430
So, your friend, Sam Harris,

659
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:12,033
worries a lot about the
existential threat of AI.

660
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:16,940
Not in the way that you've
described, but in the more.

661
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,090
- Well, he hangs out with Elon.

662
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:18,990
I don't know Elon.

663
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,843
- So, are you worried about that kind of,

664
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:28,850
you know, about the, about
either robotics systems

665
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:34,100
or traditionally defined
AI systems essentially

666
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,380
becoming super intelligent,
much more intelligent

667
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,650
than human beings and getting--

668
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:41,203
- Well, they already are, and they're not.

669
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,470
- When seen as a collective, you mean?

670
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:48,260
- I can mean all sorts of things,

671
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,280
but certainly, many of
the things that we thought

672
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,830
were peculiar to general intelligence

673
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,360
do not require general intelligence.

674
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,960
So that's been one of the big
awakenings that you can write

675
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,683
a pretty convincing sports
story from stats alone.

676
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:09,393
Without needing to have watched the game.

677
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,840
So, you know, is it
possible to write lively

678
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,240
prose about politics?

679
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,323
Yeah, no, not yet.

680
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:20,390
So, we're sort of all over the map.

681
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,750
One of the things about chess,

682
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,420
there's a question I once asked on Quora

683
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,940
that didn't get a lot of response,

684
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,100
which was, what is the greatest
brilliancy ever produced

685
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,450
by a computer in a chess game?

686
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:32,760
Which was different than the question

687
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,510
of what is the greatest game ever played.

688
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,960
So if you think about brilliancies,

689
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,660
is what really animates many of us

690
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,313
to think of chess as an art form.

691
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,060
Those are those moves and combinations

692
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:49,060
that just show such
flair, panache and soul.

693
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,520
Computers weren't really great at that.

694
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,330
They were great positional monsters.

695
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:56,930
And recently we've started
seeing brilliancies.

696
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:00,130
- [Lex] Yeah, a few
grandmasters have identified

697
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:02,890
with AlphaZero that things
were quite brilliant.

698
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:06,280
- Yeah, so that's an example of something.

699
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,230
We don't that that's AGI,
but in a very restricted set

700
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:12,700
of rules like chess,
you're starting to see

701
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,483
poetry of a high order.

702
00:36:17,299 --> 00:36:20,840
And so I don't like the idea
that we're waiting for AGI.

703
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:25,840
AGI is sort of slowly infiltrating
our lives in the same way

704
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:29,700
that I don't think a worm should be,

705
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,840
you know C. Elegans shouldn't
be treated as non conscious

706
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,550
because it only has 300 neurons.

707
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:37,820
Maybe it just has a very
low level of consciousness.

708
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,790
Because we don't understand what

709
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,790
these things mean as they scale up.

710
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:43,640
So, am I worried about
this general phenomena?

711
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,330
Sure, but I think that one of the things

712
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,390
that's happening is that
a lot of us are fretting

713
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:52,453
about this in part because of human needs.

714
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:57,300
We've always been worried
about the Golem, right?

715
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,760
- [Lex] Well, the Golem is
the artificially created--

716
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,730
- Life, you know?

717
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:01,750
- [Lex] It's like Frankenstein
type of character--

718
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,823
- Yeah, sure, it's a Jewish version.

719
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,780
Frankenberg, Franken--

720
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,290
- Yeah, that makes sense.

721
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:14,470
- Sorry, so the, but we've
always been worried about

722
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:17,720
creating something like
this and it's getting closer

723
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,903
and closer and there are ways
in which we have to realize

724
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:26,440
that the whole thing, the whole thing that

725
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,303
we've experienced are
the context of our lives,

726
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,370
is almost certainly coming to an end.

727
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:34,660
And I don't mean to suggest

728
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:38,970
that we won't survive, I don't know.

729
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:40,970
And I don't mean to suggest
that it's coming tomorrow.

730
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:45,850
It could be 300, 500
years, but there's no plan

731
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:48,470
that I'm aware of, if
we have three rocks that

732
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:53,470
we could possibly inhabit that
are sensible within current

733
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,900
technological dreams; the
Earth, the Moon and Mars,

734
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:02,060
and we have a very
competitive civilization

735
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:05,100
that is still forced
into violence to sort out

736
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,450
disputes that cannot be arbitrated.

737
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:10,870
It is not clear to me that we
have a long term future until

738
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:14,320
we get to the next stage,
which is to figure out whether

739
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,810
or not the Einsteinian
speed limit can be broken,

740
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:19,863
and that requires our source code.

741
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,650
- Our source code, the stuff
in our brains to figure out?

742
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:26,450
What do you mean by our source code?

743
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:27,890
- The source code of the context.

744
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:30,050
Whatever it is that produces the quarks,

745
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,550
the electrons, the neutrinos.

746
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:35,130
- Oh, our source code,
I got it, so this is--

747
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:37,100
- You're talking about
the stuff that's written

748
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,190
in a higher level language.

749
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,371
- Yeah, yeah, that's right.

750
00:38:39,371 --> 00:38:41,617
You're talking about the low
level, the bits or even lower--

751
00:38:41,617 --> 00:38:46,560
- Right, that's what is
currently keeping us here.

752
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,560
We can't even imagine, you
know, we have hair brain schemes

753
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:54,363
for staying within the
Einsteinian speed limit.

754
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,340
You know, maybe if we
could just drug ourselves

755
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,130
and go into a suspended state or we could

756
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,410
have multiple generations of that.

757
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:02,810
I think all that stuff is pretty silly.

758
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:06,170
But, I think it's also pretty
silly to imagine that our

759
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:08,330
wisdom is going to
increase to the point that

760
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:11,810
we can have the toys we have and we're

761
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:14,050
not going to use them for 500 years.

762
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:17,440
- Speaking of Einstein, I had
a profound breakthrough when

763
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,360
I realized you're just one
letter away from the guy.

764
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,960
- Yeah, but I'm also one
letter away from Feinstein.

765
00:39:24,107 --> 00:39:25,307
- Well, you get to pick.

766
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,540
Okay, so, unified theory.

767
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:32,690
You know, you've worked, you
enjoy the beauty of geometry.

768
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:34,370
Well, I don't actually
know if you enjoy it.

769
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,783
You certainly are quite good at it--

770
00:39:35,783 --> 00:39:37,983
- I tremble before it.
- Tremble before it.

771
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,180
If you're religious that is one of the--

772
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,140
- I don't have to be religious.

773
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:45,050
It's just so beautiful,
you will tremble anyway.

774
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:50,050
- I just read Einstein's
biography and one of the ways,

775
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,610
one of the things you've
done is try to explore

776
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:58,530
a unified theory talking about
a 14 dimensional observerse

777
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:02,033
that has the 4D space time
continuum embedded in it.

778
00:40:03,217 --> 00:40:05,990
I'm just curious how you think,

779
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:08,180
philosophically at a high level,

780
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,773
about something more than four dimensions.

781
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:15,547
How do you try to, what does
it make you feel talking

782
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,280
in the mathematical world about dimensions

783
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,193
that are greater than
the ones we can perceive?

784
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,130
Is there something that you take away

785
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:27,050
that's more than just the math?

786
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,483
- Well, first of all, stick
out your tongue at me.

787
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:34,790
Okay, now.
(Lex chuckling)

788
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:37,070
On the front of that tongue.
- Yeah?

789
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,520
- There was a sweet receptor.

790
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:44,490
And next to that were salt
receptors on two different sides.

791
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:46,670
A little bit farther back
there were sour receptors,

792
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,690
and you wouldn't show me the back

793
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:50,090
of your tongue where
your bitter receptor was.

794
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:51,300
- [Lex] I show the good side always.

795
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:56,300
- Okay, but that was four
dimensions of taste receptors.

796
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,890
But you also had pain
receptors on that tongue

797
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:01,180
and probably heat
receptors on that tongue.

798
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,200
So let's assume that you have one of each.

799
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,330
That would be six dimensions.

800
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:07,880
So when you eat something,
you eat a slice of pizza

801
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:14,360
and it's got some hot pepper
on it, maybe some jalapeno.

802
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,680
You're having a six
dimensional experience, dude.

803
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,120
- Do you think we over
emphasize the value of time

804
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:24,370
as one of the dimensions or space?

805
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:26,450
Well, we certainly over
emphasize the value of time

806
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,200
'cause we things to start and end,

807
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,490
or we really don't like things
to end, but they seem to.

808
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:33,430
- Well, what if you flipped
one of the spacial dimensions

809
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:35,030
into being a temporal dimension?

810
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,690
And you and I were to meet
in New York City and say,

811
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:42,110
well where and when should we meet?

812
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:46,550
And I say, how about I'll
meet you on 36th and Lexington

813
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:51,263
at 2:00 in the afternoon and
11 o'clock in the morning?

814
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,690
That would be very confusing.

815
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,970
- Well, it's so convenient for us

816
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:59,310
to think about time, you mean?

817
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:02,070
- We happen to be in a
delicious situation in which

818
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:04,320
we have three dimensions
of space and one of time,

819
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,500
and they're woven together in
this sort of strange fabric

820
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,430
where we can trade off a
little space for a little time.

821
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,310
But we still only have one dimension

822
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:13,410
that is picked out relative
to the other three.

823
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:15,600
It's very much Gladys Knight and the Pips.

824
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,757
- So, which one developed for who?

825
00:42:17,757 --> 00:42:19,680
Did we develop for these dimensions?

826
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,500
Or did the dimensions, or were they always

827
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,660
there and it doesn't--

828
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,520
- Well, do you imagine
that there isn't a place

829
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,210
where there are four temporal dimensions?

830
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:28,810
Or two and two of space and time?

831
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:30,700
Or three of time and one of space?

832
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:33,870
And then would time not be
playing the role of space?

833
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,410
Why do you imagine that the sector

834
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:37,620
that you're in is all that there is?

835
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,900
- I certainly do not, but
I can't imagine otherwise.

836
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:44,640
I mean, I haven't done
ayahuasca or any of those drugs.

837
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,110
I hope to one day, but--

838
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,060
- Instead of doing ayahuasca,

839
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,550
you could just head over to Building Two.

840
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:50,810
- That's where the mathematicians are?

841
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:52,090
- [Eric] Yeah, that's where they hang.

842
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:53,430
- [Lex] Just to look at some geometry?

843
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:55,530
- Well just ask about
pseudo-Riemannian geometry,

844
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:56,982
that's what you're interested in.

845
00:42:56,982 --> 00:42:58,550
(Lex chuckling)
- [Lex] Okay.

846
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:01,440
- Or you can talk to a
shaman and end up in Peru.

847
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,080
- And then some extra
money for that trip--

848
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,920
- Yeah, but you won't be
able to do any calculations

849
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,460
if that's how you choose to go about it.

850
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,310
- Well, a different kind of calculation--

851
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:09,810
- So to speak.
- Yeah.

852
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:11,650
One of my favorite people, Edward Franco,

853
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:13,890
Berkeley professor,
author of Love and Math,

854
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:18,530
great title for a book,
said that you were quite a

855
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:21,100
remarkable intellect to
come up with such beautiful,

856
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:25,070
original ideas in terms of
unified theory and so on.

857
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:28,120
But you were working outside academia.

858
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:31,193
So, one question in developing ideas

859
00:43:31,193 --> 00:43:33,530
that are truly original,
truly interesting,

860
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:36,680
what's the difference between
inside academia and outside

861
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,560
academia when it comes
to developing such ideas?

862
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,170
- Oh, it's a terrible
choice, a terrible choice.

863
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:46,880
So, if you do it inside of academics,

864
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,660
you are forced to constantly...

865
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:56,770
show great loyalty to the consensus

866
00:43:56,770 --> 00:44:00,340
and you distinguish yourself with small,

867
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,970
almost microscopic heresies

868
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:05,043
to make your reputation in general.

869
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:10,477
And you have very competent
people and brilliant people who

870
00:44:10,477 --> 00:44:15,477
are working together who formed
very deep social networks,

871
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:21,150
and have a very high level of behavior,

872
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:24,130
at least within mathematics
and at least technically

873
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:26,203
within physics, theoretical physics.

874
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:31,393
When you go outside, you meet
lunatics and crazy people.

875
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:38,340
Madmen and these are people
who do not usually subscribe

876
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:42,353
to the consensus position and
almost always lose their way.

877
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:48,810
And the key question is will
progress likely come from

878
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:54,200
someone who is miraculously
managed to stay within

879
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,700
the system and is able to
take on a larger amount

880
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:00,363
of heresy, that is sort of unthinkable?

881
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:04,550
In which case, that will be fascinating.

882
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:08,400
Or, is it more likely that
somebody will maintain a level

883
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,400
of discipline from outside of
academics and be able to make

884
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:18,600
use of the freedom that comes
from not having to constantly

885
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,720
affirm your loyalty to the
consensus of your field.

886
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:25,070
- So you've characterized
in ways that academia,

887
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:28,150
in this particular sense is declining.

888
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:32,590
You posted the plot, the older population

889
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:34,420
of the faculty is getting larger.

890
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:37,080
The younger is getting smaller and so on.

891
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,670
So, which direction of the two
are you more hopeful about?

892
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:43,280
- Well, the Baby Boomers
can't hang on forever.

893
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,630
- Which is first of all in general true,

894
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:46,470
and second of all in academia--

895
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:49,470
- But that's really what
this time is about--

896
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:52,360
- Is the Baby Boomers control.
- Is we didn't, we're used to

897
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,610
like financial bubbles
that last a few years

898
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:57,000
in length and then pop.

899
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,970
- Yes.
- The Baby Boomer bubble

900
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:03,940
is this really long lived
thing and all of the ideology,

901
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:07,220
all of the behavior patterns,
the norms, you know,

902
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:08,950
for example string theory is an almost

903
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:11,620
entirely Baby Boomer phenomena.

904
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:14,260
It was something that Baby
Boomers were able to do because

905
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:18,463
it required a very high level
of mathematical ability.

906
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:24,890
- You don't think of string
theory as an original idea?

907
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:26,627
- Oh, I mean it was original to Veneziano

908
00:46:26,627 --> 00:46:29,700
who probably is older
than the Baby Boomers

909
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,170
and there are people who are younger than

910
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:33,350
the Baby Boomers who are
still doing string theory.

911
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:36,140
And I'm not saying that
nothing discovered within

912
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:38,480
the large string theoretic
complex is wrong.

913
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,470
Quite the contrary.

914
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:43,070
A lot of brilliant mathematics
and a lot of the structure

915
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:45,673
of physics was elucidated
by string theorists.

916
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:49,260
What do I think of the deliverable nature

917
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:52,480
of this product that will not
ship called string theory?

918
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,340
I think that is largely an
affirmative action program

919
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:58,400
for highly mathematically
and geometrically

920
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,620
talented Baby Boomer
physicists so that they

921
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:06,560
can say that they're
working on something within

922
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,460
the constraints of what they
will say is quantum gravity.

923
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,230
Now there are other schemes.

924
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:14,580
You know, there's like asymptotic safety.

925
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:17,140
There are other things that
you could imagine doing.

926
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:20,800
I don't think much of any
of the major programs,

927
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:25,800
but to have inflicted this
level of loyalty through

928
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:29,560
a shibboleth, well surely
you don't question x.

929
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,830
Well, I question almost
everything in the string program,

930
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:34,260
and that's why I got out of physics.

931
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:37,350
When you called me
physicist, was a great honor,

932
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:39,180
but the reason I didn't become a physicist

933
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,300
wasn't that I fell in
love with mathematics.

934
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:46,300
As I said, wow, in 1984, 1983,
I saw the field going mad,

935
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:51,120
and I saw that mathematics,
which has all sorts of problems,

936
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,940
was not going insane.

937
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:55,530
And so instead of studying
things within physics,

938
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:57,120
I thought it was much safer to study

939
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,270
the same objects within mathematics.

940
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:01,190
And there's a huge price to pay for that.

941
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:03,460
You lose physical intuition.

942
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,560
But the point is, is that it wasn't

943
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,220
a North Korean reeducation camp, either.

944
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:11,240
- Are you hopeful about cracking open

945
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,590
the Einstein Unified
Theory in a way that has,

946
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:19,273
in really understanding
whether uniting everything

947
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,980
together with quantum theory and so on?

948
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:25,220
- I mean, I'm trying to
play this role myself.

949
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:30,020
To do it to the extent of
handing it over to the more

950
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:33,823
responsible, more professional,
more competent community.

951
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:37,760
So, I think that they're
wrong about a great number

952
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,280
of their belief structures,
but I do believe,

953
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:45,160
I mean I have a really
profound love hate relationship

954
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,058
with this group of people.

955
00:48:47,058 --> 00:48:48,710
- On the physics side?
- Oh yeah.

956
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:50,360
- 'Cause the mathematicians actually seem

957
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,200
to be much more open minded and--

958
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,100
- Well, they are and they aren't.

959
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,610
They're open minded about anything

960
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:57,430
that looks like great math.

961
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:58,450
- Right.
- Right, they'll study

962
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:00,220
something that isn't
very important physics,

963
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:03,283
but if it's beautiful
mathematics then they'll have,

964
00:49:03,283 --> 00:49:06,140
they have great intuition
about these things.

965
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:07,930
As good as the mathematicians are,

966
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:09,560
and I might even intellectually

967
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,770
at some horsepower level
give them the edge.

968
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:16,640
The theoretical physics
community is bar none,

969
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,900
the most profound intellectual community

970
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,950
that we have ever created.

971
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:25,010
It is the number one, there
is nobody in second place

972
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:25,843
as far as I'm concerned.

973
00:49:25,843 --> 00:49:29,280
Like, in their spare time,
in the spare time they

974
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,110
invented molecular biology.

975
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:33,150
- What was the origin
of molecular biology?

976
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:34,021
You're saying physicists--

977
00:49:34,021 --> 00:49:35,110
- Well somebody like Francis Crick.

978
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:38,650
A lot of the early molecular biologists--

979
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:40,870
- Were physicists?
- Yeah, I mean you know,

980
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:42,027
Schrodinger wrote What is Life

981
00:49:42,027 --> 00:49:44,470
and that was highly inspirational.

982
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:49,470
I mean, you have to appreciate
that there is no community

983
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:54,720
like the basic research
community in theoretical physics.

984
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:59,440
And it's not something, I'm
highly critical of these guys.

985
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:04,440
I think that they would just
wasted the decades of time with

986
00:50:06,752 --> 00:50:11,060
and your religious devotion
to their misconceptualization

987
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,290
of where the problems were in physics.

988
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:15,270
But this has been the
greatest intellectual

989
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:18,803
collapse ever witnessed within academics.

990
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:22,790
- You see it as a collapse or just a lull?

991
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:25,970
- Oh, I'm terrified that we're
about to lose the vitality.

992
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:27,963
We can't afford to pay these people.

993
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:31,910
We can't afford to give them
an accelerator just to play

994
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:35,230
with in case they find something
at the next energy level.

995
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:37,253
These people created our economy.

996
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,840
They gave us the RAD Lab and radar.

997
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:45,570
They gave us two atomic
devices to end World War II.

998
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:48,460
They created the semi-conductor
and the transistor

999
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:51,240
to power our economy through Moore's law.

1000
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,750
As a positive externality
of particle accelerators,

1001
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,420
they created the World Wide Web

1002
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:00,100
and we have the insolence to say,

1003
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,450
why should we fund you
with our taxpayer dollars?

1004
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:06,253
No, the question is, are you
enjoying your physics dollars?

1005
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,970
Right, these guys signed the world's

1006
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:11,900
worst licensing agreement.

1007
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:15,540
- Right.
- And, if they simply charged

1008
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:20,260
for every time you used a
transistor or a URL or enjoyed

1009
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:24,060
the peace that they have
provided during this period

1010
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:26,910
of time through the terrible
weapons that they developed,

1011
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:29,680
or your communications devices.

1012
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,360
All of the things that power our economy,

1013
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,950
I really think came out of physics,

1014
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:35,780
even to the extent that
chemistry came out of physics,

1015
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:37,970
and molecular biology came out of physics.

1016
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:40,030
So, first of all you have to know

1017
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:42,530
that I'm very critical of this community.

1018
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:45,140
Second of all, it is our
most important community.

1019
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:47,630
We have neglected it, we've abused it,

1020
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:51,300
we don't take it seriously,
we don't even care to get

1021
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:55,380
them to rehab after a couple
of generations of failure.

1022
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:58,060
Right, no one, I mean I
think the youngest person

1023
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,080
to have really contributed
to the standard model

1024
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:05,710
at a theoretical level
was born in 1951, right?

1025
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:06,543
Frank Wilczek.

1026
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:12,660
And almost nothing has happened
that in theoretical physics

1027
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:17,080
after 1973, '74, that
sent somebody to Stockholm

1028
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:21,690
for theoretical development
that predicted experiment.

1029
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:23,290
So, we have to understand

1030
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:24,820
that we are doing this to ourselves.

1031
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:28,510
Now, with that said, these
guys have behaved abysmally,

1032
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:32,040
in my opinion, because
they haven't owned up

1033
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,450
to where they actually are,

1034
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:34,990
what problems they're really facing,

1035
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:37,360
how definite they can actually be.

1036
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,490
They haven't shared some of their

1037
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:40,930
most brilliant discoveries,
which are desperately needed

1038
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:43,220
in other fields like gauge theory,

1039
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:45,650
which at least the
mathematicians can share,

1040
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:47,480
which is an upgrade of
the differential calculus

1041
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,050
of Newton and Leibniz,

1042
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:50,650
and they haven't shared the importance

1043
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:53,640
of renormalization theory,
even though this should

1044
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,860
be standard operating
procedure for people across

1045
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:59,510
the sciences dealing with different layers

1046
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,080
and different levels of phenomena, so--

1047
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,500
- And by shared you mean
communicated in such a way

1048
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,860
that it disseminates throughout
the different sciences?

1049
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:09,760
- These guys are sitting,
both theoretical physicists

1050
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,900
and mathematicians are sitting on top

1051
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:16,133
of a giant stockpile of
intellectual gold, right?

1052
00:53:16,133 --> 00:53:17,850
They have so many things that

1053
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:19,780
have not been manifested anywhere.

1054
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:23,000
I was just on Twitter I think

1055
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,780
I mentioned the Hoberman switch pitch

1056
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,010
that shows the self
duality of the tetrahedron

1057
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:29,690
realizes that it linkage mechanism.

1058
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:33,040
Now this is like a triviality and it makes

1059
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,710
an amazing toy that's,

1060
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:36,510
you know, built a market.
- Yeah.

1061
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:38,560
- Hopefully a fortune for Chuck Hoberman.

1062
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:41,330
Well, you have no idea
how much great stuff

1063
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:43,493
that these priests have
in their monastery.

1064
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:48,130
- So, it's a truly a love and
hate relationship for you?

1065
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:49,490
It sounds like it's
more on the love side--

1066
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:50,950
- [Eric] This building
that we're in right here.

1067
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:52,010
- Yes.

1068
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:54,870
- Is the building in which
I really put together

1069
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:57,690
the conspiracy between the
National Academy of Sciences

1070
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:00,250
and the National Science
Foundation through

1071
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:03,220
the Government University
Industry Research round table

1072
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:05,490
to destroy the bargaining
power of American

1073
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:08,523
academics using foreign labor.

1074
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,110
On microfiche in the base.
- Post docs and so on?

1075
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:13,280
- Oh yeah, that was done
here in this building.

1076
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,400
Isn't that weird?

1077
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,216
- I'm truly speaking with a
revolutionary and a radical--

1078
00:54:18,216 --> 00:54:20,140
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1079
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:25,140
At an intellectual level, I
am absolutely garden variety.

1080
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:27,610
I'm just straight down the middle.

1081
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:30,000
The system that we are in.

1082
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,680
This University is functionally insane.

1083
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:34,740
- [Lex] Yeah.

1084
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:37,470
- Harvard is functionally
insane and we don't

1085
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:41,210
understand that when we
get these things wrong,

1086
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:43,610
the financial crisis made this very clear.

1087
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:46,170
There was a long period
where every grownup,

1088
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:51,170
everybody with a tie who
spoke in baritone tones

1089
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,480
with a right degree at
the end of their name.

1090
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,600
- Yeah.
- Were talking about how

1091
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,773
we banished volatility, we
were in the great moderation.

1092
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:04,070
Okay, they were all crazy.

1093
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:05,250
And who was right?

1094
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:06,810
It was like Nassim Taleb.

1095
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:08,430
- Right.
- Nouriel Roubini.

1096
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,170
Now, what happens is is that they

1097
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:13,010
claimed the market went crazy.

1098
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:14,660
But the market didn't go crazy.

1099
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:16,920
The market had been crazy
and what happened is

1100
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,090
is that it suddenly went sane.

1101
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:21,160
Well that's where we are with academics.

1102
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,910
Academics right now is mad as a hatter

1103
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:25,570
and it's absolutely evident.

1104
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:27,080
I can show you graph after graph.

1105
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,590
I can show you the internal discussions.

1106
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:30,590
I can show you the conspiracies.

1107
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:33,510
Harvard's dealing with one
right now over its admissions

1108
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:38,230
policies for people of color
who happen to come from Asia.

1109
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:41,930
All of this madness is necessary
to keep the game going.

1110
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:44,569
What we're talking about,
just while we're on

1111
00:55:44,569 --> 00:55:47,147
the topic of revolutionaries,
is we're talking about

1112
00:55:47,147 --> 00:55:49,853
the danger of an outbreak of sanity.

1113
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:53,060
- Yeah, you're the guy pointing out

1114
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:55,380
the elephant in the room here and--

1115
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:56,880
- The elephant has no clothes.

1116
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,620
- Is that how that goes?

1117
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:04,620
I was gonna talk a little
bit to Joe Rogan about this,

1118
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:09,493
ran out of time, but
I think you have some,

1119
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:13,040
just listening to you, you
can probably speak really

1120
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,520
eloquently to academia on the difference

1121
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,550
between the different fields.

1122
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:19,890
So, do you think there's a
difference between science,

1123
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:22,490
engineering and then the
humanities in academia,

1124
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:25,860
in terms of tolerance, that
they're willing to tolerate?

1125
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:30,790
So, from my perspective I
thought computer science

1126
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:34,750
and maybe engineering is more
tolerant to radical ideas,

1127
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:36,507
but that's perhaps innocent of me.

1128
00:56:36,507 --> 00:56:39,320
'Cause I always, you know
all the battles going

1129
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,450
on now are a little bit
more of the humanities side

1130
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:43,210
and gender studies and so on.

1131
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:46,590
- Have you seen the American
Mathematical Society's

1132
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:49,490
publication of an essay
called Get out the Way.

1133
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:53,390
- I have not, what's the--
- The idea is that white men

1134
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:58,070
who hold positions within
Universities in mathematics

1135
00:56:58,070 --> 00:57:01,730
should vacate their positions
so that young black women

1136
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:03,850
can take over or something like this.

1137
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:04,900
- That's in terms of diversity,

1138
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,140
which I also wanted to ask you about,

1139
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:10,190
but in terms of diversity
of strictly ideas.

1140
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:12,420
- Oh, sure.
- Do you think,

1141
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:15,030
'cause you're basically
saying physics as a community,

1142
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:17,780
has become a little bit
intolerant to some degree,

1143
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:21,517
to new radical ideas or
at least you said that--

1144
00:57:21,517 --> 00:57:24,210
- But it's changed a little bit recently.

1145
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:28,150
Which is that even string
theory is now admitting,

1146
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:32,140
okay, this doesn't look very
promising in the short term.

1147
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:36,023
Right, so the question is what compiles,

1148
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:39,640
if you wanna take the
computer science metaphor.

1149
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,950
What will get you into a journal?

1150
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:44,300
Will you spend your life
trying to push some paper

1151
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:47,490
into a journal or will
it be accepted easily?

1152
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:50,390
What do we know about the
characteristics of the submitter

1153
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:55,473
and what gets taken up and what does not?

1154
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:59,240
All of these fields are
experiencing pressure because

1155
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:04,240
no field is performing so
brilliantly well that it's

1156
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:09,850
revolutionizing our way
of speaking and thinking,

1157
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:12,840
in the ways in which we
have become accustomed.

1158
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:15,913
- But don't you think, even
in theoretical physics,

1159
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:19,910
a lot of times, even with
theories like string theory,

1160
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:22,900
you could speak to this,
it does eventually lead to

1161
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,550
what are the ways that this
theory would be testable?

1162
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:28,800
- Yeah, ultimately, although look,

1163
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,640
there's this thing about Popper

1164
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,830
and the scientific method that's a cancer

1165
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:36,300
and a disease in the minds
of very smart people.

1166
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:39,830
That's not really how most
of the stuff gets worked out,

1167
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:41,213
it's how it gets checked.

1168
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,440
- Right, so--
- And there is a dialog

1169
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,550
between theory and experiment.

1170
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:49,970
But, everybody should
read Paul Dirac's 1963

1171
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:56,670
Scientific American article where he,

1172
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:57,790
you know, it's very interesting.

1173
00:58:57,790 --> 00:58:59,560
He talks about it as if it was about

1174
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:01,760
the Schrodinger equation
and Schrodinger's failure

1175
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,760
to advance his own work
because of his failure

1176
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,300
to account for some phenomena.

1177
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,760
The key point is that if your
theory is a slight bit off,

1178
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,200
it won't agree with experiment,

1179
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,530
but it doesn't mean that the
theory is actually wrong.

1180
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:16,310
But Dirac could as easily have
been talking about his own

1181
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:18,790
equation in which he predicted

1182
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:22,080
that the electrons should
have an anti-particle.

1183
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:24,890
And since the only positively
charged particle that was

1184
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:27,790
known at the time was the
proton, Heisenberg pointed out,

1185
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:30,190
well shouldn't your
anti-particle, the proton,

1186
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:31,660
have the same mass as the electron

1187
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:33,600
and doesn't that invalidate your theory?

1188
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,630
So, I think that Dirac was actually being,

1189
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:39,400
potentially quite sneaky
in talking about the fact

1190
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,340
that he had been pushed
off of his own theory,

1191
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:42,933
to some extent, by Heisenberg.

1192
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:47,990
But look, we fetishize
the scientific method

1193
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:52,250
and Popper and falsification
because it protects

1194
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:55,510
us from crazy ideas entering the field.

1195
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:57,920
So, you know, it's a question
of balancing type one and type

1196
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:01,490
two error and we were pretty
maxed out in one direction.

1197
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:02,700
- The opposite of that.

1198
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,180
Let me say what comforts me.

1199
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:09,180
Sort of biology or engineering
at the end of the day,

1200
01:00:09,330 --> 01:00:11,550
does the thing work?
- Yeah.

1201
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:15,490
- You can test the crazies away.

1202
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:17,987
Well see now, you're saying
but some ideas are truly crazy

1203
01:00:17,987 --> 01:00:21,360
and some are actually correct, so.

1204
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:24,350
- Well there's pre-correct
currently crazy.

1205
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:25,340
- Yeah.
- Right?

1206
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:27,210
And so you don't wanna
get rid of everybody

1207
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:29,713
who's pre-correct and currently crazy.

1208
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:35,240
The problem is is that we don't
have standards in general,

1209
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:38,110
for trying to determine who has to be put

1210
01:00:38,110 --> 01:00:40,450
to the sword in terms of their career

1211
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:44,660
and who has to be protected
as some sort of giant time

1212
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:47,900
suck pain in the ass who
may change everything.

1213
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,260
- Do you think that's possible?

1214
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:51,370
Creating a mechanism of those selective--

1215
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:53,310
- Well, you're not gonna like
the answer, but here it comes.

1216
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:55,180
- [Lex] Oh, boy.

1217
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:59,400
- It has to do with very human elements.

1218
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,810
We're trying to do this
at the level of like rules

1219
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:03,553
and fairness, it's not gonna work.

1220
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:07,943
'Cause the only thing that
really understands this,

1221
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:12,280
you ever read The Double Helix?

1222
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,113
- It's a book?

1223
01:01:13,113 --> 01:01:14,669
- Oh, you have to read this book--

1224
01:01:14,669 --> 01:01:17,510
- Oh, boy.
- Not only did Jim Watson

1225
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:22,000
half discover this three
dimensional structure of DNA,

1226
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,973
he was also one hell of a
writer before he became an ass.

1227
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:28,090
No, he's tried
- Yes, like he is.

1228
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:29,740
- To destroy his own reputation--

1229
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:32,950
- I knew about the ass, I didn't
know about the good writer.

1230
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:35,810
- Jim Watson is one of the most
important people now living,

1231
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:40,550
and as I've said before,
Jim Watson is too important

1232
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:42,863
a legacy to be left to Jim Watson.

1233
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:49,290
That book tells you more about
what actually moves the dial.

1234
01:01:49,290 --> 01:01:51,760
I mean, there's another
story about him which

1235
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,410
I don't agree with, which is that he stole

1236
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:54,860
everything from Rosalind Franklin.

1237
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:57,360
I mean, the problems that he
had with Rosalind Franklin

1238
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:01,340
are real, but we should
actually honor that tension

1239
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:03,100
in our history by delving into it,

1240
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:05,190
rather than having a simple solution.

1241
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:09,300
Jim Watson talks about Francis
Crick being a pain in the ass

1242
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:11,750
that everybody secretly
knew was super brilliant.

1243
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:17,670
And there's an encounter between
Chargaff who came up with

1244
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:20,910
the equimolar relations
between the nucleotides,

1245
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:22,290
who should've gotten the structure

1246
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:24,670
of DNA and Watson and Crick,

1247
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:28,960
and you know, he talks
about missing a shiver

1248
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,640
in the heartbeat of biology
and this stuff is so gorgeous,

1249
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:34,453
it just makes you tremble
even thinking about it.

1250
01:02:36,310 --> 01:02:41,310
Look, we know very often
who is to be feared,

1251
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:44,033
and we need to fund the
people that we fear.

1252
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,320
The people who are wasting our time need

1253
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,700
to be excluded from the conversation.

1254
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:53,010
You see, and you know,
maybe we'll make some errors

1255
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:58,010
in both directions, but we
have known our own people.

1256
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:01,050
We know the pains in the
asses that might work out,

1257
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:03,430
and we know the people who
are really just blowhards who

1258
01:03:03,430 --> 01:03:07,380
really have very little to
contribute most of the time.

1259
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:10,490
It's not 100%, but you're not
gonna get there with rules.

1260
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:12,670
- Right, it's using some kind of instinct.

1261
01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:16,080
I mean, to be honest, I'm
gonna make you roll your eyes

1262
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:19,827
for a second, but in the
first time I heard that there

1263
01:03:19,827 --> 01:03:22,827
was large community of people
who believe the earth is flat,

1264
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:26,450
actually made me pause and
ask myself the question--

1265
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:28,030
- Why would there be such a community?

1266
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:30,230
- Yeah, is it possible the earth is flat?

1267
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:32,023
So I had to like, wait a minute.

1268
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,180
I mean, then you go
through a thinking process

1269
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:37,530
that I think is really healthy.

1270
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:40,233
It ultimately ends up being
a geometry thing I think.

1271
01:03:41,782 --> 01:03:44,160
It's an interesting thought
experiment at the very least.

1272
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,610
- Well, see I don't, I do
a different version of it.

1273
01:03:46,610 --> 01:03:48,700
I say, why is this community stable?

1274
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:51,560
- Yeah, that's a good way to analyze it.

1275
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,260
- Interesting that whatever we've done

1276
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:54,963
has not erased the community.

1277
01:03:55,970 --> 01:03:57,880
So, you know, they're
taking a long shot bet

1278
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:59,333
that won't pan out, you know?

1279
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:01,880
Maybe we just haven't thought enough about

1280
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,530
the rationality of the square root of two

1281
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:05,230
and somebody brilliant will figure it out.

1282
01:04:05,230 --> 01:04:07,130
Maybe we will eventually land one day

1283
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:09,180
on the surface of Jupiter and explore it.

1284
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:14,080
Right, these are crazy things
that will never happen.

1285
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:17,307
- So, much of social media
operates by AI algorithms,

1286
01:04:17,307 --> 01:04:19,580
we talked this a little bit,

1287
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:21,750
recommending the content you see.

1288
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:26,620
So, on this idea of radical
thought, how much should AI show

1289
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:29,883
you things you disagree
with on Twitter and so on?

1290
01:04:30,930 --> 01:04:32,810
In the Twitterverse in the--

1291
01:04:32,810 --> 01:04:34,560
- I hate this question.

1292
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:35,443
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1293
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:37,340
- 'Cause you don't know the answer?

1294
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,960
- No, no, no, no.

1295
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:42,140
Look, they've pushed
out this cognitive Lego

1296
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:45,820
to us that will just lead to madness.

1297
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:47,983
It's good to be challenged with things

1298
01:04:47,983 --> 01:04:49,187
that you disagree with.

1299
01:04:49,187 --> 01:04:50,550
You answer is, no.

1300
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:53,240
It's gonna to be challenged
with interesting things with

1301
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:57,150
which you currently disagree,
but that might be true.

1302
01:04:57,150 --> 01:04:59,110
I don't really care about
whether or not I disagree

1303
01:04:59,110 --> 01:05:01,390
with something or don't
disagree, I need to know why

1304
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:05,400
that particular disagreeable
thing is being pushed out.

1305
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,080
Is it because it's likely to be true?

1306
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:09,760
Is it because, is there some reason?

1307
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:13,880
Because I write a computer
generator to come up

1308
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,940
with an infinite number
of disagreeable statements

1309
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:17,680
that nobody needs to look at.

1310
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,700
So, please before you push things at me

1311
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:22,810
that are disagreeable, tell me why.

1312
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:25,260
- There is an aspect in which
that question is quite dumb,

1313
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:28,900
especially because it's
being used to almost

1314
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:33,810
very generically by these
different networks to say,

1315
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:35,490
well we're trying to work this out,

1316
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:39,670
but you know, basically how much,

1317
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:43,600
do you see the value of
seeing things you don't like?

1318
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:46,170
Not you disagree with, because
it's very difficult to know

1319
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:50,540
exactly what you articulated,
which is the stuff that's

1320
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:53,380
important for you to consider
that you disagree with.

1321
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:55,000
That's really hard to figure out.

1322
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,180
The bottom line is the
stuff you don't like.

1323
01:05:57,180 --> 01:06:00,823
If you're a Hillary Clinton supporter,

1324
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:03,840
it might not make you feel good

1325
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:05,870
to see anything about Donald Trump.

1326
01:06:05,870 --> 01:06:06,980
That's the only thing algorithms

1327
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:08,970
can really optimize for currently.

1328
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:10,963
They really can't--
- No, they can do better.

1329
01:06:11,847 --> 01:06:14,280
- You think so?
- No, we're engaged in some

1330
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:19,280
moronic back and forth where
I have no idea why people who

1331
01:06:21,790 --> 01:06:24,620
are capable of building Google, Facebook,

1332
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:27,020
Twitter are having us in these

1333
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:28,930
incredibly low level discussions.

1334
01:06:28,930 --> 01:06:31,240
Do they not know any smart people?

1335
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:32,820
Do they not have the phone numbers

1336
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:35,020
of people who can elevate
these discussions?

1337
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:39,065
- They do, but this--

1338
01:06:39,065 --> 01:06:39,898
- Please, no, no, no.
- They're optimizing for

1339
01:06:39,898 --> 01:06:41,170
a different thing and they are pushing

1340
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:42,443
those people out of those rooms.

1341
01:06:42,443 --> 01:06:46,113
- No, they're optimizing
for things we can't see,

1342
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,620
and yes, profit is there.

1343
01:06:48,620 --> 01:06:50,280
Nobody's questioning that.

1344
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:54,820
But they're also optimizing
for things like political

1345
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:56,670
control or the fact that
they're doing business

1346
01:06:56,670 --> 01:06:59,230
in Pakistan and so they don't
wanna talk about all the

1347
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:03,320
things that they're going
to bending to in Pakistan.

1348
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:07,420
So, we're involved in a fake discussion.

1349
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:09,160
- You think so, you
think these conversations

1350
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:11,270
at that depth are happening inside Google?

1351
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:12,540
You don't think they have some

1352
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:15,750
basic metrics under user engagements?

1353
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:18,260
- You're having a fake
conversation with us, guys.

1354
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:19,940
We know you're having a fake conversation.

1355
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:22,490
I do not wish to be part
of your fake conversation.

1356
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:26,740
You know how to cool these units.

1357
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:29,380
You know high availability
like nobody's business.

1358
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:33,200
My Gmail never goes down, almost.

1359
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:36,400
- So you think just because
they can do incredible work on

1360
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,330
the software side with infrastructure,

1361
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:43,330
they can also deal with some
of these difficult questions

1362
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:46,330
about human behavior, human understanding,

1363
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:47,699
you're not, (chuckling).

1364
01:07:47,699 --> 01:07:50,950
- I mean, I've seen
the developer's screens

1365
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:54,270
that people take shots
of inside of Google.

1366
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:55,340
- [Lex] Yeah.

1367
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:58,470
- And I've heard stories
inside of Facebook and Apple.

1368
01:07:58,470 --> 01:08:01,450
We're not, we're engaged, they're engaging

1369
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:04,100
us in the wrong conversations.

1370
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:06,120
We are not at this low level.

1371
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,240
Here's one of my favorite questions.

1372
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:10,070
- Yeah.
- Why is every piece

1373
01:08:10,070 --> 01:08:13,610
of hardware that I purchase in text base

1374
01:08:13,610 --> 01:08:15,603
equipped as a listening device?

1375
01:08:16,990 --> 01:08:19,780
Where's my physical
shutter to cover my lens?

1376
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:22,670
We had this in the 1970s.

1377
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:25,130
They had cameras that
had lens caps, you know?

1378
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:27,940
How much would it cost
to have a security model?

1379
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:29,830
Pay five extra bucks.

1380
01:08:29,830 --> 01:08:33,090
Why is my indicator light
software controlled?

1381
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:35,930
Why when my camera is on, do
I not see that the light is

1382
01:08:35,930 --> 01:08:39,730
on by putting it as something
that cannot be bypassed?

1383
01:08:39,730 --> 01:08:43,030
Why have you setup all of my devices,

1384
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:44,990
at some difficulty to yourselves,

1385
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:47,750
as listening devices and we
don't even talk about this.

1386
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:51,550
This thing is total fucking bullshit.

1387
01:08:51,550 --> 01:08:53,100
- Well, I hope, so.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1388
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:55,430
- These discussions are
happening about privacy,

1389
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:57,100
'cause they're more difficult
than you give 'em credit for--

1390
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:59,070
- It's not just privacy.
- Yeah?

1391
01:08:59,070 --> 01:09:01,120
- It's about social control.

1392
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,600
We're talking about social control.

1393
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:07,160
Why do I not have controls
over my own levers?

1394
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:09,980
Just have a really cute
UI, where I can switch,

1395
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,540
I can dial things or I can at least

1396
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:13,410
see what the algorithms are.

1397
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:15,080
- You think that there are some

1398
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:17,410
deliberate choices being made here--

1399
01:09:17,410 --> 01:09:21,610
- There's emergence
and there is intention.

1400
01:09:21,610 --> 01:09:22,970
There are two dimensions.

1401
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:26,360
The vector does not
collapse onto either axis.

1402
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:29,130
But the idea that anybody who suggests

1403
01:09:29,130 --> 01:09:34,130
that intention is completely
absent is a child.

1404
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:37,470
- That's really beautifully
put and like many things

1405
01:09:37,470 --> 01:09:38,901
you've said is gonna make me--

1406
01:09:38,901 --> 01:09:40,850
- Can I turn this around slightly though?

1407
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:42,407
- Yeah.
- I sit down with you

1408
01:09:42,407 --> 01:09:44,960
and you say that you're
obsessed with my feed.

1409
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,410
- Uh huh.
- I don't even know what

1410
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:49,780
my feed is, what are
you seeing that I'm not?

1411
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:53,620
- I was obsessively looking
through your feed on Twitter,

1412
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:55,440
'cause it was really
enjoyable because there's

1413
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:58,280
the Tom Lehrer element,
there's the humor in it.

1414
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:01,730
- By the way that feed is
ericrweinstein on Twitter.

1415
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:03,043
- That's great.
- @ericrweinstein.

1416
01:10:04,124 --> 01:10:06,650
- Yeah.
- No, but seriously, why?

1417
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:10,220
- Why did I find it enjoyable
or what was I seeing?

1418
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:11,400
- What are you looking for?

1419
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:12,960
Why are we doing this?

1420
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,850
What is this podcast about?

1421
01:10:14,850 --> 01:10:16,520
I know you got all these
interesting people.

1422
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:18,970
I'm just some guy who is
sort of a podcast guest.

1423
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:22,410
- Sort of a podcast, you're
not even wearing a tie.

1424
01:10:22,410 --> 01:10:23,282
I mean,
- I'm not even wearing a tie.

1425
01:10:23,282 --> 01:10:25,082
- It's not even a serious interview.

1426
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:30,610
I was searching for
meaning, for happiness,

1427
01:10:30,610 --> 01:10:34,470
for a dopamine rush, so
short term and long term.

1428
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:36,720
- And how are you finding your way to me?

1429
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:41,260
What is, I don't honestly know
what I'm doing to reach you.

1430
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:45,870
- The representing ideas
which field common sense

1431
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:47,920
to me and not many people are speaking.

1432
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:52,453
So it's kinda like, the
Intellectual Dark Web folks, right?

1433
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:57,590
These folks, from Sam
Harris to Jordan Peterson,

1434
01:10:57,590 --> 01:11:00,400
to yourself, are saying
things where it's like,

1435
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,160
you're like saying,
look there's an elephant

1436
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:07,160
and he's not wearing any
clothes and I say, yeah, yeah,

1437
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,460
let's have more of that conversation.

1438
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:11,010
That's how I'm finding you.

1439
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:13,360
- I'm desperate to try to change

1440
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,750
the conversation we're having.

1441
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:17,460
I'm very worried we've
got an election in 2020.

1442
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:20,600
I don't think we can
afford four more years of

1443
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:25,360
a misinterpreted message,
which is what Donald Trump was,

1444
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:28,410
and I don't want the
destruction of our institutions.

1445
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:30,630
They all seem hellbent
on destroying themselves.

1446
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:33,220
So, I'm trying to save
theoretical physics,

1447
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:34,780
trying to save the New York Times,

1448
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:39,340
trying to save our various
processes and I think it feels

1449
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:44,170
delusional to me that this
is falling to a tiny group

1450
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:47,870
of people who are willing
to speak out without getting

1451
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:49,720
so freaked out that everything they say

1452
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:51,490
will be misinterpreted
and that their lives

1453
01:11:51,490 --> 01:11:53,138
will be ruined through the process.

1454
01:11:53,138 --> 01:11:56,040
I mean, I think we're in an
absolutely bananas period

1455
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:58,300
of time and I don't believe
it should fall to such

1456
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:01,173
a tiny number of shoulders
to shoulder this weight.

1457
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:05,880
- So, I have to ask you
on a capitalism side,

1458
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:08,220
you mentioned that technology
is killing capitalism

1459
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:12,930
or has effects that are,
well not unintended,

1460
01:12:12,930 --> 01:12:16,050
but not what economists would predict

1461
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:18,830
or speak of capitalism creating.

1462
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:21,300
I just wanna talk to you about in general,

1463
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:23,680
the effect of even then,
artificial intelligence

1464
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:27,790
or technology automation taking
away jobs and these kinds

1465
01:12:27,790 --> 01:12:31,540
of things and what you think
is the way to alleviate that.

1466
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:33,910
Whether the Andrew Ang
presidential candidate with

1467
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:38,700
universal basic income, UBI,
what are your thoughts there?

1468
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:40,840
How do we fight off the negative effects

1469
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:42,552
of technology that--

1470
01:12:42,552 --> 01:12:43,810
- All right, you're a software guy, right?

1471
01:12:43,810 --> 01:12:44,643
- Yep.

1472
01:12:44,643 --> 01:12:48,840
- A human being is a
worker, is an old idea.

1473
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,580
- Yes.
- A human being has a worker

1474
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:53,990
is a different object, right?
- Yes.

1475
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:55,770
- So if you think about
object oriented programming

1476
01:12:55,770 --> 01:12:59,660
as a paradigm, a human being has a worker

1477
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:01,870
and a human being has a soul.

1478
01:13:01,870 --> 01:13:04,420
We're talking about the fact
that for a period of time,

1479
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:06,773
the worker that a human being has,

1480
01:13:07,610 --> 01:13:11,373
was in a position to feed the
soul that a human being has.

1481
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:15,070
However, we have two separate claims

1482
01:13:15,070 --> 01:13:17,063
on the value in society.

1483
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:20,750
One is as a worker and
the other is as a soul,

1484
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:23,490
and the soul needs
sustenance, it needs dignity,

1485
01:13:23,490 --> 01:13:25,363
it needs meaning, it needs purpose.

1486
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:32,420
As long as you're means of
support is not highly repetitive,

1487
01:13:33,650 --> 01:13:34,850
I think you have a while to go

1488
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:36,960
before you need to start worrying.

1489
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,790
But if what you do is highly repetitive

1490
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:42,640
and it's not terrible generative,
you are in the crosshairs

1491
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:46,300
of for loops and while loops and that's

1492
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:50,050
what computers accel at;
repetitive behavior and when I say

1493
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:53,440
repetitive I may mean things
that have never happened

1494
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:54,860
through combinatorial possibilities,

1495
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:57,240
but as long as it has a
looped characteristic to it,

1496
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,140
you're in trouble.

1497
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:03,000
We are seeing a massive
push towards socialism

1498
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,230
because capitalists are slow to address

1499
01:14:07,230 --> 01:14:10,920
the fact that a worker may
not be able to make claims.

1500
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:15,710
A relatively undistinguished
median member of our society

1501
01:14:15,710 --> 01:14:19,387
still has needs to
reproduce, needs to dignity

1502
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:25,570
and when capitalism abandons
the median individual

1503
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:29,703
or the bottom tenth or
whatever it's going to do,

1504
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:34,250
it's flirting with revolution
and what concerns me

1505
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:36,330
is that the capitalists
aren't sufficiently

1506
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:38,113
capitalistic to understand this.

1507
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:43,080
You really want to court
authoritarian control

1508
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:46,010
in our society because you
can't see that people may not

1509
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:48,200
be able to defend themselves
in the marketplace

1510
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:51,090
because the marginal
product of their labor

1511
01:14:51,090 --> 01:14:55,080
is too low to feed
their dignity as a soul?

1512
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:58,480
So, my great concern is
that our free society

1513
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:02,370
has to do with the fact
that we are self organized.

1514
01:15:02,370 --> 01:15:05,020
I remember looking down
from my office in Manhattan

1515
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:07,950
when Lehman Brothers
collapsed and thinking,

1516
01:15:07,950 --> 01:15:09,970
who's gonna tell all these
people that they need

1517
01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:14,150
to show up at work when they
don't have a financial system

1518
01:15:14,150 --> 01:15:16,493
to incentivize them to show up at work?

1519
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:20,920
So, my complaint is first of
all, not with the socialists,

1520
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,040
but with the capitalists,

1521
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:24,570
which is you guys are being idiots.

1522
01:15:24,570 --> 01:15:28,900
You're courting revolution by
continuing to harp on the same

1523
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:33,090
old ideas that well, try
harder, bootstrap yourself.

1524
01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:35,513
Yeah, to an extent that
works, to an extent.

1525
01:15:36,350 --> 01:15:38,700
But we are clearly headed in
a place that there's nothing

1526
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:43,700
that ties together our need
to contribute and our need

1527
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:47,630
to consume and that may not
be provided by capitalism,

1528
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:49,490
because it may have been
a temporary phenomena.

1529
01:15:49,490 --> 01:15:52,840
So, check out my article
on anthropic capitalism

1530
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,070
and the new gimmick economy.

1531
01:15:55,070 --> 01:15:58,050
I think people are late
getting the wake up call,

1532
01:15:58,050 --> 01:16:01,130
and we would be doing a
better job saving capitalism

1533
01:16:01,130 --> 01:16:04,200
from itself because I don't want this done

1534
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:07,630
under authoritarian control,
and the more we insist that

1535
01:16:07,630 --> 01:16:10,530
everybody who's not thriving
in our society during their

1536
01:16:10,530 --> 01:16:13,070
reproductive years in
order to have a family,

1537
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:15,333
is failing at a personal level.

1538
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:18,410
I mean, what a disgusting
thing that we're saying.

1539
01:16:18,410 --> 01:16:19,960
What a horrible message.

1540
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:22,710
Who the hell have we
become that we've so bought

1541
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:26,630
in to the Chicago model that
we can't see the humanity

1542
01:16:26,630 --> 01:16:28,170
that we're destroying in that process

1543
01:16:28,170 --> 01:16:32,120
and I hate the thought of
communism, I really do.

1544
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:34,590
My family has flirted
with it decades past,

1545
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:38,260
it's a wrong, bad idea, but
we are going to need to figure

1546
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:41,892
out how to make sure that
those souls are nourished

1547
01:16:41,892 --> 01:16:45,100
and respected and capitalism
better have an answer.

1548
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:47,260
And I'm betting on capitalism,
but I gotta tell ya,

1549
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:49,110
I'm pretty disappointed with my team.

1550
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:52,210
- So you're still on the capitalism team,

1551
01:16:52,210 --> 01:16:54,212
just there's a theme here--

1552
01:16:54,212 --> 01:16:55,812
- [Eric] Well, radical capitalism.

1553
01:16:55,812 --> 01:16:56,820
- Right, hyper capitalism, yeah.

1554
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:59,970
- Look, I want, I think
hyper capitalism is gonna

1555
01:16:59,970 --> 01:17:02,030
have to be coupled to hyper socialism.

1556
01:17:02,030 --> 01:17:04,300
You need to allow the
most productive people

1557
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:08,270
to create wonders and you
gotta stop bogging them down

1558
01:17:08,270 --> 01:17:10,990
with all of these extra nice requirements.

1559
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:12,920
You know, nice is dead.

1560
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,510
Good has a future.

1561
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:19,043
Nice doesn't have a future
because nice ends up with gulags.

1562
01:17:19,890 --> 01:17:21,160
- Damn, that's a good line.

1563
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:22,730
Okay, last question.

1564
01:17:22,730 --> 01:17:27,170
You Tweeted today, a simple,
quite insightful equation

1565
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:33,027
saying "Imagine that every
unit f of fame you picked up,

1566
01:17:33,027 --> 01:17:35,690
"s stalkers and h haters".

1567
01:17:35,690 --> 01:17:37,590
So, I imagine s and h are dependent

1568
01:17:37,590 --> 01:17:39,520
on your path to fame,
perhaps a little bit--

1569
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:40,700
- Well, it's not a simple.

1570
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:42,490
I mean, people always take
these things literally

1571
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:45,190
when you have like 280
characters to explain yourself.

1572
01:17:47,470 --> 01:17:49,520
- So you mean that's not a mathematical--

1573
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,560
- No, there's no law.
- Oh, okay, all right.

1574
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:54,040
- I just, I put the word
imagine because I still

1575
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:56,310
have a mathematicians
desire for precision.

1576
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:57,860
- Yes.
- Imagine that this were true.

1577
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:00,130
- But there was a beautiful way to imagine

1578
01:18:00,130 --> 01:18:02,585
that there is a law that
has those variables in it--

1579
01:18:02,585 --> 01:18:03,418
- [Eric] Yeah, yeah.

1580
01:18:03,418 --> 01:18:06,740
- And you've become
quite famous these days,

1581
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:10,660
so how do you yourself
optimize that equation with the

1582
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:13,800
peculiar kind of fame that
you've gathered along the way?

1583
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:14,780
- I wanna be kinder.

1584
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:17,420
I wanna be kinder to myself,
I wanna kinder to others,

1585
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:19,253
I wanna be able to have heart,

1586
01:18:22,150 --> 01:18:24,500
compassion and these things
are really important,

1587
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:29,010
and I have a pretty spectrumy
kind of approach to analysis.

1588
01:18:29,010 --> 01:18:30,510
I'm quite literal.

1589
01:18:30,510 --> 01:18:33,160
I can go full Rain Man on
you at any given moment.

1590
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:34,750
No, I can, I can.

1591
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:36,500
It's facultative autism, if you like,

1592
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:37,440
and people are gonna get angry

1593
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,740
because they want autism
to be respected, but.

1594
01:18:41,090 --> 01:18:44,323
When you see me coding or
you see me doing mathematics,

1595
01:18:46,031 --> 01:18:48,431
you know, I speak with
speech apnea, (stutters),

1596
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:50,480
be right down for dinner, you know?

1597
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:51,313
- [Lex] Yeah.

1598
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,240
- We have to try to integrate ourselves

1599
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:57,410
in those tensions between, you know,

1600
01:18:57,410 --> 01:19:00,700
it's sort of back to us as
a worker and us as a soul.

1601
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:05,600
Many of us are optimizing one
at the expense of the other.

1602
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:09,280
And I struggle with social
media and I struggle with people

1603
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:12,580
making threats against our
families and I struggle

1604
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:15,870
with just how much pain people are in.

1605
01:19:15,870 --> 01:19:18,863
And if there's one message I
would like to push out there,

1606
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:22,380
you're responsible, everybody, all of us,

1607
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:25,860
myself included, with struggling.

1608
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:28,100
Struggle mightily because it's nobody

1609
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:30,820
else's job to do your struggle for you.

1610
01:19:30,820 --> 01:19:33,500
Now with that said, if you're
struggling and you're trying,

1611
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,570
and you're trying to figure
out how to better yourself

1612
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:38,150
and where you've failed, where
you've let down your family,

1613
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:40,873
your friends, your workers,
all this kind of stuff,

1614
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:44,043
give yourself a break, you know?

1615
01:19:45,004 --> 01:19:48,320
If it's not working out, I
have a lifelong relationship

1616
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,330
with failure and success.

1617
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:53,320
There's been no period
of my life where both

1618
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:55,940
haven't been present
in one form or another.

1619
01:19:55,940 --> 01:19:58,780
And, I do wish to say that a lot

1620
01:19:58,780 --> 01:20:01,230
of the times people
think this is glamorous.

1621
01:20:01,230 --> 01:20:03,203
I'm about to go, you know,
do a show with Sam Harris.

1622
01:20:03,203 --> 01:20:05,150
- Yeah.
- People are gonna listen

1623
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:07,310
in on two guys having a
conversation on stage.

1624
01:20:07,310 --> 01:20:09,390
It's completely crazy when I'm
always trying to figure out

1625
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:12,330
how to make sure that those
people get maximum value

1626
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:15,100
and that's why I'm doing this podcast,

1627
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:18,203
you know, just give yourself a break.

1628
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:20,530
You owe us your struggle.

1629
01:20:20,530 --> 01:20:22,920
You don't owe your
family or your coworkers

1630
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:25,843
or your lovers or your
family members success.

1631
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:29,710
As long as you're in there and
you're picking yourself up,

1632
01:20:29,710 --> 01:20:33,660
recognize that this new
situation with the economy

1633
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:37,100
that doesn't have the juice
to sustain our institutions,

1634
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:39,730
has caused the people
who've risen to the top

1635
01:20:39,730 --> 01:20:43,420
of those institutions to
get quite brutal and cruel.

1636
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:45,130
Everybody is lying at the moment.

1637
01:20:45,130 --> 01:20:46,823
Nobody is really truth teller.

1638
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:50,120
Try to keep your humanity about you.

1639
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:52,840
Try to recognize that if you're failing,

1640
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:55,380
if things aren't where you
want them to be and you're

1641
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:56,670
struggling and you're trying to figure out

1642
01:20:56,670 --> 01:20:58,460
what you're doing wrong,
what you could do,

1643
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:01,320
it's not necessarily all your fault.

1644
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:03,000
We are in a global situation.

1645
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,090
I have not met the people who are honest,

1646
01:21:06,090 --> 01:21:08,270
kind, good, successful.

1647
01:21:08,270 --> 01:21:12,770
Nobody that I've met is
checking all the boxes.

1648
01:21:12,770 --> 01:21:14,470
Nobody's getting all 10s.

1649
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:17,370
So, I just think that's
an important message

1650
01:21:17,370 --> 01:21:18,790
that doesn't get pushed out enough.

1651
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:21,810
Either people wanna
hold society responsible

1652
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:24,020
for their failures,
which is not reasonable.

1653
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:26,160
You have to struggle, you have to try.

1654
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:28,950
Or they wanna say you're 100%
responsible for your failures,

1655
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:30,393
which is total nonsense.

1656
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:32,930
- Beautifully put.

1657
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:34,400
Eric, thank you so much for talking today.

1658
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:35,783
- Thanks for having me, buddy.
