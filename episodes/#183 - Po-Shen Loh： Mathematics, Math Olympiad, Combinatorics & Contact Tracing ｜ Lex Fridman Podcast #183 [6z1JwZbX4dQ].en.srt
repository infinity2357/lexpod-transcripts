accomplish this
 

171
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,030
accomplish this
so i do especially when there's

172
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,040
so i do especially when there's
 

173
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,470
so i do especially when there's
turbulence

174
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,480
turbulence
 

175
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,550
turbulence
which is you know like on the way here

176
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:54,560
which is you know like on the way here
 

177
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,550
which is you know like on the way here
yeah there was turbulence and

178
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,560
yeah there was turbulence and
 

179
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,470
yeah there was turbulence and
the the plane jiggled even the flight

180
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:58,480
the the plane jiggled even the flight
 

181
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,149
the the plane jiggled even the flight
attendant had to hold on to the side

182
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:00,159
attendant had to hold on to the side
 

183
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,509
attendant had to hold on to the side
and i was just thinking to myself it's

184
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:01,519
and i was just thinking to myself it's
 

185
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,110
and i was just thinking to myself it's
amazing that this happens all the time

186
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,120
amazing that this happens all the time
 

187
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,550
amazing that this happens all the time
and the wings don't fall off you know

188
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:04,560
and the wings don't fall off you know
 

189
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:04,949
and the wings don't fall off you know
like

190
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959
like
 

191
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,630
like
given how many planes are flying but

192
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:06,640
given how many planes are flying but
 

193
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,470
given how many planes are flying but
then i often think about it and i'm like

194
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:08,480
then i often think about it and i'm like
 

195
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,229
then i often think about it and i'm like
you know a long time ago i think people

196
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
you know a long time ago i think people
 

197
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,830
you know a long time ago i think people
didn't trust elevators

198
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
didn't trust elevators
 

199
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,589

yeah in a 40-story building in new york

200
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
yeah in a 40-story building in new york
 

201
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,110
yeah in a 40-story building in new york
city and

202
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120
city and
 

203
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,550
city and
now we just take it completely for

204
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:16,560
now we just take it completely for
 

205
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,910
now we just take it completely for
granted that you can step into this

206
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:17,920
granted that you can step into this
 

207
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,550

shaft

208
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
shaft
 

209
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,910

which is 40 floors up and down and it

210
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:21,920
which is 40 floors up and down and it
 

211
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,710
which is 40 floors up and down and it
will just not

212
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:22,720
will just not
 

213
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,229
will just not
fail yeah again i'm the same way with

214
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:26,239
fail yeah again i'm the same way with
 

215
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,990
fail yeah again i'm the same way with
elevators but also buildings

216
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,000
elevators but also buildings
 

217
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,550
elevators but also buildings
when i'll stand on the 40th floor and

218
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560
when i'll stand on the 40th floor and
 

219
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,670
when i'll stand on the 40th floor and
wonder

220
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:31,680
wonder
 

221
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,630
wonder
how the heck are we not falling right

222
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:34,640
how the heck are we not falling right
 

223
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,270
how the heck are we not falling right
now

224
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,280
now
 

225
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,149
now
like how how amazing it is with the high

226
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159
like how how amazing it is with the high
 

227
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,110
like how how amazing it is with the high
winds

228

like structurally just the earthquakes
and the vibrations i mean

232
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
and the vibrations i mean
 

233
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,710
and the vibrations i mean
natural vibrations in the ground like

234
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,720
natural vibrations in the ground like
 

235
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,309
natural vibrations in the ground like
how is this how are

236
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:46,319
how is this how are
 

237
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,070
how is this how are
all of these you go like new york city

i mean to me one of the most beautiful

242
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:51,519
i mean to me one of the most beautiful
 

243
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,750
i mean to me one of the most beautiful
things actually mathematically too is uh

what's the hardest part about
programming those games

348
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120
programming those games
 

349
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,510
programming those games
and maybe can you tell the story about

350
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
and maybe can you tell the story about
 

351
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,110
and maybe can you tell the story about
about building those games

352
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,120
about building those games
 

353
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,590
about building those games
sure i actually tried to do those in

354
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:43,600
sure i actually tried to do those in
 

355
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,350
sure i actually tried to do those in
high school because i was just curious

356
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
high school because i was just curious
 

357

ideas but i actually also like
 

377
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,070
ideas but i actually also like
seeing execution of an idea all the way

378
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,080
seeing execution of an idea all the way
 

379
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,510
seeing execution of an idea all the way
from beginning to end in something that

380
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:05,520
from beginning to end in something that
 

381
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,990
from beginning to end in something that
works so for example in high school i

382
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,000
works so for example in high school i
 

383

was lucky enough to grow up
 

385
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,309
was lucky enough to grow up
in the late 90s when even

in the late 90s when even
 

387
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,990
in the late 90s when even
a high school student could hope to make

388
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,000
a high school student could hope to make
 

389
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,469
a high school student could hope to make
something sort of comparable to the

390
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
something sort of comparable to the
 

391
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,309
something sort of comparable to the
shareware games that were out there

392
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:18,319
shareware games that were out there
 

393
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,150
shareware games that were out there
not i say the word sort of like still

394
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
not i say the word sort of like still

quite far away but at least i didn't
 

397
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,350
quite far away but at least i didn't
need to hire a 3d

cg artist there weren't enough pixels to

400
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
cg artist there weren't enough pixels to
 

401
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,110

draw anybody

402
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,120
draw anybody
 

403
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,150

even i can draw right bad art of course
 

405
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,469
even i can draw right bad art of course
but

406
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:30,479
but
 

407
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,909
but
the point is i wanted to know is it

the point is i wanted to know is it
 

409
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,590
the point is i wanted to know is it
possible for me to try to do those

410
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:33,600
possible for me to try to do those
 

411
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,550
possible for me to try to do those
things

412
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:34,560
things
 

413
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,189
things
where back in those days you didn't even

414
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:37,199
where back in those days you didn't even
 

415
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:37,670
where back in those days you didn't even
have an

416
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:37,680
have an
 

417
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,070
have an
easy way to draw letters on the screen

418
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080
easy way to draw letters on the screen
 

419
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,270
easy way to draw letters on the screen
in a particular font

420
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
in a particular font
 

421
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,870
in a particular font
you couldn't just say import a font it

422
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:42,880
you couldn't just say import a font it
 

423
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,469
you couldn't just say import a font it
wasn't like python so

424
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:44,479
wasn't like python so
 

425
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,070
wasn't like python so
for example back then if you play those

426
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080
for example back then if you play those
 

427
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,749
for example back then if you play those
games in the in the web browser which is

428
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:47,759
games in the in the web browser which is
 

429
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,790
games in the in the web browser which is
emulating

430
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:48,800
emulating
 

431
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,830

00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:51,840
um the the old school computer
 

433
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,830
um the the old school computer
those even the letters you see those are

434
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:53,840
those even the letters you see those are
 

435
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,070
those even the letters you see those are
made by individual calls to draw pixels

436
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,080
made by individual calls to draw pixels
 

437
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,510
made by individual calls to draw pixels
on the screen so you built that from

438
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,520
on the screen so you built that from
 

439
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,430
on the screen so you built that from
scratch almost building a computer

440

yes the primitive that i got to use was

444
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,120
yes the primitive that i got to use was
 

445
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,790
yes the primitive that i got to use was
some code i copied off of a book

446
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
some code i copied off of a book
 

447
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,710
some code i copied off of a book
in assembly of how to put a pixel on the

and the programming programming language

452
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,400
and the programming programming language
 

453
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,670
and the programming programming language
was pascal

454
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:11,680
was pascal
 

455
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,469
was pascal
ah yeah the first one was in pascal but

456
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:14,479
ah yeah the first one was in pascal but
 

457
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,350
ah yeah the first one was in pascal but
then the

458
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360
then the
 

459
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,350
then the
other ones were in c plus plus after

460
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:17,360
other ones were in c plus plus after
 

461
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,589
other ones were in c plus plus after
that how's the emulation in the browser

462
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:19,599
that how's the emulation in the browser
 

463
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,029
that how's the emulation in the browser
work by the way is that is that true

464
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:21,039
work by the way is that is that true
 

465
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:21,510
work by the way is that is that true
real

466
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,520
real
 

467
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,950
real
because it's pretty cool you get to play

468
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:22,960
because it's pretty cool you get to play
 

469
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,629
because it's pretty cool you get to play
these games that have a very much

470
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:24,639
these games that have a very much
 

471
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,670
these games that have a very much
90s feeling to them ah so it's literally

472
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
90s feeling to them ah so it's literally
 

473
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,589
90s feeling to them ah so it's literally
making an ms-dos environment which is

474
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:29,599
making an ms-dos environment which is
 

475
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:30,070

476
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,080
literally
 

477
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,189
literally
running the old exe file wow

478
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:35,199

 

479
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,870

that could be more amazing than the

480
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:36,880
that could be more amazing than the
 

481
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,350
that could be more amazing than the
airplane so it wasn't so much about the

482
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360
airplane so it wasn't so much about the
 

483
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,589
airplane so it wasn't so much about the
video games it was more about can you

484
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:41,599
video games it was more about can you
 

485
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:42,469
video games it was more about can you
build something

486
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
build something
 

487
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,869
build something
really cool from scratch yes and

488
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:46,879
really cool from scratch yes and
 

489
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,390
really cool from scratch yes and
you did a bunch of programming

490
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,400
you did a bunch of programming
 

491
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,550
you did a bunch of programming
competitions

492
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:50,560
competitions
 

493
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,029
competitions
what was your interest your love for

494
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:53,039
what was your interest your love for
 

495
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,869
what was your interest your love for
programming

496
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
programming
 

497
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,790
programming
what did you learn to that experience

498
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:56,800
what did you learn to that experience
 

499

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,470
realize that
it's not so hard to build something that

670
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,480
it's not so hard to build something that
 

671
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,430
it's not so hard to build something that
works

672
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,440
works
 

673
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,750
works
to have a system that uh successfully

674
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:39,760
to have a system that uh successfully
 

675
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,590
to have a system that uh successfully
takes in inputs and produces outputs and

676
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:41,600
takes in inputs and produces outputs and
 

677
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,269
takes in inputs and produces outputs and
solves a difficult problem

678
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:43,279
solves a difficult problem
 

679
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,750
solves a difficult problem
and that directly transfers to building

680
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:45,760
and that directly transfers to building
 

681
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,069
and that directly transfers to building
a startup essentially that can help

682
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:48,079
a startup essentially that can help
 

683
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,389
a startup essentially that can help
some aspect of this world as long as

684
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:50,399
some aspect of this world as long as
 

685
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,990
some aspect of this world as long as
it's mostly be

686
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,000
it's mostly be
 

687
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,230
it's mostly be
based on software engineering things get

688
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,240
based on software engineering things get
 

689
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,350
based on software engineering things get
really tricky when you have to

690
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:55,360
really tricky when you have to
 

691
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,389
really tricky when you have to
manufacture stuff

692
00:10:58,389 --> 00:10:58,399
manufacture stuff
 

693
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,230
manufacture stuff
that's why people like elon musk are so

694
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
that's why people like elon musk are so
 

695
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,829
that's why people like elon musk are so
impressive that they it's not just

00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:01,839
impressive that they it's not just

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,230
tesla autopilot is just not just
software it's it's like you have to

702
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,240
software it's it's like you have to
 

703
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,710
software it's it's like you have to
actually

704
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720
actually
 

705
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,430
actually
like have factories that build uh cars

706
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:09,440
like have factories that build uh cars
 

707
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,350
like have factories that build uh cars
and there's like a million components

708
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:11,360
and there's like a million components
 

709
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,550
and there's like a million components
involved in in the machinery required to

710

involved in in the machinery required to
 

711
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,389
involved in in the machinery required to
assemble those cards and so on but in

00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:16,399
assemble those cards and so on but in
 

713
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,910
assemble those cards and so on but in
software one person

714
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:17,920
software one person
 

715
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,630
software one person
can change the world which is uh uh

716
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:20,640
can change the world which is uh uh
 

717
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,350
can change the world which is uh uh
incredible

718
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,360
incredible
 

719
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,069
incredible
but on the mathematics side what uh if

720
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:24,079
but on the mathematics side what uh if
 

721
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:24,550
but on the mathematics side what uh if
you

722
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:24,560
you
 

723
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,110
you
look back or maybe today what made you

724
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,120
look back or maybe today what made you
 

725
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,590
look back or maybe today what made you
fall in love with mathematics

726
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:29,600
fall in love with mathematics
 

727
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,470
fall in love with mathematics
for me i think i've always been very

728
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,480
for me i think i've always been very
 

729
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,190
for me i think i've always been very
attracted

730
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,200
attracted
 

731
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,829
attracted
to challenge as i already indicated with

732
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:35,839
to challenge as i already indicated with
 

733
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,269
to challenge as i already indicated with
the writing the program

734
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:37,279
the writing the program
 

735
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,310
the writing the program
i guess if i see something that's hard

736
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,320
i guess if i see something that's hard
 

737
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,590
i guess if i see something that's hard
or supposed to be impossible it

738
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:43,600
or supposed to be impossible it
 

739
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,350
or supposed to be impossible it
certain sometimes i say maybe maybe i

740
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:45,360
certain sometimes i say maybe maybe i
 

741
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,030
certain sometimes i say maybe maybe i
want to see if i can pull that off

742
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
want to see if i can pull that off
 

743
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,110
want to see if i can pull that off
and with the mathematics the math

744
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,120
and with the mathematics the math
 

745
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,350
and with the mathematics the math
competitions presented problems

746
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,360
competitions presented problems
 

747
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,310
competitions presented problems
that were hard that i didn't know how to

748
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,320
that were hard that i didn't know how to
 

749
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,949
that were hard that i didn't know how to
start

750
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:54,959
start
 

751
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,190
start
but for which i could conceivably try to

752
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,200
but for which i could conceivably try to
 

753
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,949
but for which i could conceivably try to
learn how to solve them

754
00:11:58,949 --> 00:11:58,959
learn how to solve them
 

755
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,069
learn how to solve them
so i mean there are other things that

756
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:00,079
so i mean there are other things that
 

757
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,670
so i mean there are other things that
are hard called like get something to

758
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:01,680
are hard called like get something to
 

759
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,350
are hard called like get something to
mars get people to mars

760
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360
mars get people to mars
 

761
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,910
mars get people to mars
and i didn't i still don't think that

762
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:05,920
and i didn't i still don't think that
 

763
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,550
and i didn't i still don't think that
i'm

764
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:06,560
i'm
 

765
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,470
i'm
able to solve that problem on the other

766
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:08,480
able to solve that problem on the other
 

767
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,069
able to solve that problem on the other
hand the math problems struck me as

768
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:10,079
hand the math problems struck me as
 

769
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:10,949
hand the math problems struck me as
things which are

770
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:10,959
things which are
 

771
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,629
things which are
hard and with significant amount of

772
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:12,639
hard and with significant amount of
 

773
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,629
hard and with significant amount of
extra work i could figure it out

774
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:14,639
extra work i could figure it out
 

775
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,910
extra work i could figure it out
and maybe they would actually even be

776
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:15,920
and maybe they would actually even be
 

777
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,150
and maybe they would actually even be
useful like that mathematical skill is

778
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,160
useful like that mathematical skill is
 

779
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,870
useful like that mathematical skill is
the core

780
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:18,880
the core
 

781
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,550
the core
of lots of other things

782
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:22,560

 

783
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,069

that's really interesting maybe you

784
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:24,079
that's really interesting maybe you
 

785
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,150
that's really interesting maybe you
could speak to that because

786
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,160
could speak to that because
 

787
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,350
could speak to that because
a lot of people say that math is hard

788
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:29,360
a lot of people say that math is hard
 

789
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,790
a lot of people say that math is hard
as a kind of negative statement

790
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:32,800
as a kind of negative statement
 

791
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,030
as a kind of negative statement
it always seemed to me a little bit like

792
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,040
it always seemed to me a little bit like
 

793
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,350
it always seemed to me a little bit like
that's kind of a positive statement

794
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,360
that's kind of a positive statement
 

795
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,750
that's kind of a positive statement
that all things that are worth having in

796
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:39,760
that all things that are worth having in
 

797
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,350
that all things that are worth having in
this world are hard

798
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,360
this world are hard
 

799
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,350
this world are hard
i mean everything that people think

800
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:43,360
i mean everything that people think
 

801
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,389
i mean everything that people think
about

802
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:44,399
about
 

803
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,870
about
that they would love to do whether it's

804
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:46,880
that they would love to do whether it's
 

805
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,670
that they would love to do whether it's
sports

806
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:47,680
sports
 

807
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,870
sports
whether it's art music

808
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:50,880
whether it's art music
 

809
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,670
whether it's art music
and all the sciences they're going to be

810
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:53,680
and all the sciences they're going to be
 

811
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,550
and all the sciences they're going to be
hard if you want to do something special

812
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:56,560
hard if you want to do something special
 

813
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,230
hard if you want to do something special
so is there something you could say to

814
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:58,240
so is there something you could say to
 

815
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,069
so is there something you could say to
that idea that math is hard

816
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:00,079
that idea that math is hard
 

817
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,269
that idea that math is hard
should it be made easy or should it be

818
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:03,279
should it be made easy or should it be
 

819
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,150
should it be made easy or should it be
hard

820
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,160
hard
 

821
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,710
hard
ah so i think maybe i want to dig in a

822
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
ah so i think maybe i want to dig in a
 

823
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,269
ah so i think maybe i want to dig in a
little bit onto this hard part and say

824
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:09,279
little bit onto this hard part and say
 

825
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,190
little bit onto this hard part and say
uh i think the interesting thing about

826
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,200
uh i think the interesting thing about
 

827
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,430
uh i think the interesting thing about
the math is that

828
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:13,440
the math is that
 

829
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,350
the math is that
you can see a question that you didn't

830
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:15,360
you can see a question that you didn't
 

831
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,550
you can see a question that you didn't
know how to

832
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:16,560
know how to
 

833
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,190
know how to
start doing it before and over a course

834
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,200
start doing it before and over a course
 

835
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,670
start doing it before and over a course
of

836
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:19,680
of
 

837
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,230
of
thinking about it you can come up with a

838
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:22,240
thinking about it you can come up with a
 

839
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,030
thinking about it you can come up with a
way

840
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,040
way
 

841
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,509
way
to to solve it and so you can move from

842
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:25,519
to to solve it and so you can move from
 

843
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,230
to to solve it and so you can move from
a state of

844
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:26,240
a state of
 

845
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,310
a state of
not being able to do something to a

846
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:28,320
not being able to do something to a
 

847
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,310
not being able to do something to a
state of being able to do something

848
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,320
state of being able to do something
 

849
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,710
state of being able to do something
where you help to take yourself through

850
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:32,720
where you help to take yourself through
 

851
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,710
where you help to take yourself through
that instead of somebody else

852
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:34,720
that instead of somebody else
 

853
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,670
that instead of somebody else
spoon feeding you yes that technique so

854
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:37,680
spoon feeding you yes that technique so
 

855
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,430
spoon feeding you yes that technique so
actually here i'm already digging into

856
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:39,440
actually here i'm already digging into
 

857
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,430
actually here i'm already digging into
maybe part of my teaching philosophy

858
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:41,440
maybe part of my teaching philosophy
 

859
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,870
maybe part of my teaching philosophy
also which is that

860
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:42,880
also which is that
 

861
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,069
also which is that
i actually don't want to ever just tell

862
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:46,079
i actually don't want to ever just tell
 

863
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:46,710
i actually don't want to ever just tell
somebody

864
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:46,720
somebody
 

865
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,269
somebody
here's how you do something i actually

866
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:49,279
here's how you do something i actually
 

867
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,790
here's how you do something i actually
prefer to say here's an interesting

868
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:50,800
prefer to say here's an interesting
 

869
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,069
prefer to say here's an interesting
question

870
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:52,079
question
 

871
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,069
question
i know you don't quite know how to do it

872
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:54,079
i know you don't quite know how to do it
 

873
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,509
i know you don't quite know how to do it
do you have any ideas

874
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:55,519
do you have any ideas
 

875
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,670
do you have any ideas
this is i'm actually coming up with i'm

876
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:57,680
this is i'm actually coming up with i'm
 

877
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,110
this is i'm actually coming up with i'm
actually explaining another way that you

878
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,120
actually explaining another way that you
 

879
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,389
actually explaining another way that you
could try to do teaching

880
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:00,399
could try to do teaching
 

881
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,949
could try to do teaching
and i'm contrasting this to a method of

882
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:02,959
and i'm contrasting this to a method of
 

883
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,069
and i'm contrasting this to a method of
watch me do this

884
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:04,079
watch me do this
 

885
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,710
watch me do this
now practice it 20 times i'm trying to

886
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:06,720
now practice it 20 times i'm trying to
 

887
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,750
now practice it 20 times i'm trying to
say a lot of people

888
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:07,760
say a lot of people
 

889
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,509
say a lot of people
consider math to be hard because maybe

890
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:09,519
consider math to be hard because maybe
 

891
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,790
consider math to be hard because maybe
they can't remember

892
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:10,800
they can't remember
 

893
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,030
they can't remember
all of the methods that were taught but

894
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,040
all of the methods that were taught but
 

895
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,910
all of the methods that were taught but
for me

896
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:13,920
for me
 

897
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,990
for me
i look at the hardness and i don't think

898
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,000
i look at the hardness and i don't think
 

899
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,509
i look at the hardness and i don't think
of it as a memory hardness

900
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:17,519
of it as a memory hardness
 

901
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,389
of it as a memory hardness
i think of it as a can you invent

902
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:20,399
i think of it as a can you invent
 

903
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:20,870
i think of it as a can you invent
something

904
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:20,880
something
 

905
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,030
something
hardness and i think that if we can

906
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,040
hardness and i think that if we can
 

907
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,310
hardness and i think that if we can
teach more people

908
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,320
teach more people
 

909
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,430
teach more people
how to do that art of invention

910
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:27,440
how to do that art of invention
 

911
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,350
how to do that art of invention
in a pure cognitive way not as hard as

912
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:29,360
in a pure cognitive way not as hard as
 

913
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,590
in a pure cognitive way not as hard as
the actual hardware stuff right but like

914
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:31,600
the actual hardware stuff right but like
 

915
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,710
the actual hardware stuff right but like
in terms of the concepts and the

916
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:32,720
in terms of the concepts and the
 

917
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,230
in terms of the concepts and the
thoughts and the mathematics teaching

918
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,240
thoughts and the mathematics teaching
 

919
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,030
thoughts and the mathematics teaching
people how to

920
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,040
people how to
 

921
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,910
people how to
invent then suddenly actually they might

922
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:37,920
invent then suddenly actually they might
 

923
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,710
invent then suddenly actually they might
not even find math to be that

924
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:40,720
not even find math to be that
 

925
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,389
not even find math to be that
tiresomeness hard anymore but that

926
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:43,399
tiresomeness hard anymore but that
 

927
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:44,790
tiresomeness hard anymore but that
rewardingness hard

928
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:44,800
rewardingness hard
 

929
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,990
rewardingness hard
of i have the capability of looking at

930
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,000
of i have the capability of looking at
 

931
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,829
of i have the capability of looking at
something which i don't know what to do

932
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:49,839
something which i don't know what to do
 

933
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,430
something which i don't know what to do
and coming up with how to do it i

934
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,440
and coming up with how to do it i
 

935
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,710
and coming up with how to do it i
actually think we should be doing that

936
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:52,720
actually think we should be doing that
 

937
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,949
actually think we should be doing that
giving giving people that capability

938
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:54,959
giving giving people that capability
 

939
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,350
giving giving people that capability
so hard in the same way that invention

940
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,360
so hard in the same way that invention
 

941
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,069
so hard in the same way that invention
is hard

942
00:14:58,069 --> 00:14:58,079
is hard
 

943
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,870
is hard
that is ultimately rewarding so maybe

944
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:00,880
that is ultimately rewarding so maybe
 

945
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,829
that is ultimately rewarding so maybe
you can dig in

946
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:01,839
you can dig in
 

947
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,790
you can dig in
that a little bit longer which is um

948
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:06,800

 

949
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,150

do you see basically the way to teach

950
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,160
do you see basically the way to teach
 

951
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,269
do you see basically the way to teach
math is to present a problem

952
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:13,279
math is to present a problem
 

953
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,509
math is to present a problem
and to give a person a chance to try to

954
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:15,519
and to give a person a chance to try to
 

955
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,590
and to give a person a chance to try to
invent a solution

956
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:17,600
invent a solution
 

957
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,350
invent a solution
without with minimal amount of

958
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:19,360
without with minimal amount of
 

959
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,030
without with minimal amount of
information first

960
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,040
information first
 

961
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,110
information first
is that is that basically how do you

962
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,120
is that is that basically how do you
 

963
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,110
is that is that basically how do you
build that muscle of invention

964
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,120
build that muscle of invention
 

965
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,310
build that muscle of invention
in a student yes so the way that i i

966
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,320
in a student yes so the way that i i
 

967
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,949
in a student yes so the way that i i
guess i have

968
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:28,959
guess i have
 

969
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,470
guess i have
two different sort of ways that i try to

970
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:30,480
two different sort of ways that i try to
 

971
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,990
two different sort of ways that i try to
teach actually one of them is

972
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,000
teach actually one of them is
 

973
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,430
teach actually one of them is
in fact this semester because all my

974
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:33,440
in fact this semester because all my
 

975
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,670
in fact this semester because all my
classes were remotely delivered i even

976
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:35,680
classes were remotely delivered i even
 

977
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,110
classes were remotely delivered i even
threw them all onto my youtube channel

978
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,120
threw them all onto my youtube channel
 

979
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,150
threw them all onto my youtube channel
so you can see

980
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:38,160
so you can see
 

981
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,350
so you can see
you can see how i teach at carnegie

982
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:39,360
you can see how i teach at carnegie
 

983
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,189
you can see how i teach at carnegie
mellon but i'd often say

984
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:41,199
mellon but i'd often say
 

985
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,509
mellon but i'd often say
hey everyone let's try to do this any

986
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:43,519
hey everyone let's try to do this any
 

987
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,550
hey everyone let's try to do this any
ideas

988
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:44,560
ideas
 

989
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,870
ideas
and that actually changes my role as a

990
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:46,880
and that actually changes my role as a
 

991
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,670
and that actually changes my role as a
professor

992
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:47,680
professor
 

993
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,910
professor
from a person who shows up for class

994
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:49,920
from a person who shows up for class
 

995
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,749
from a person who shows up for class
with a script of what i want to talk

996
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:51,759
with a script of what i want to talk
 

997
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:52,310
with a script of what i want to talk
through

998
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:52,320
through
 

999
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,150
through
i actually i don't have a script the way

1000

there's something that we want to learn

1004
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,040
there's something that we want to learn
 

1005
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,949
there's something that we want to learn
how to do and we're going to do it by

1006
00:15:58,949 --> 00:15:58,959
how to do and we're going to do it by
 

1007
00:15:58,959 --> 00:15:59,990
how to do and we're going to do it by
improv

1008

improv
 

1009
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,749
improv
i'm talking about the same method as

1010
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:01,759
i'm talking about the same method as
 

1011
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,749
i'm talking about the same method as
improv comedy which is where

1012
00:16:03,749 --> 00:16:03,759
improv comedy which is where
 

1013
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,990
improv comedy which is where
you tell me some ideas and i'll try to

1014
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,000
you tell me some ideas and i'll try to
 

1015
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,389
you tell me some ideas and i'll try to
yes and them

1016
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
yes and them
 

1017
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,310
yes and them
you know what i mean and then together

00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,320
you know what i mean and then together
 

1019
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,749
you know what i mean and then together
we're gonna come up with a proof

1020
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:11,759
we're gonna come up with a proof
 

1021
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,150
we're gonna come up with a proof
of this concept where you were deeply

1022
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,160
of this concept where you were deeply
 

1023
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,949
of this concept where you were deeply
involved

1024
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:14,959
involved
 

1025
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,870
involved
in creating the proof actually every

1026
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:16,880
in creating the proof actually every
 

1027
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,790
in creating the proof actually every
time i teach the class we do every proof

1028
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:18,800
time i teach the class we do every proof
 

1029
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,550
time i teach the class we do every proof
slightly differently because it's based

1030
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:20,560
slightly differently because it's based
 

1031
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,990
slightly differently because it's based
on how the students came

1032
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,000
on how the students came
 

1033
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,710
on how the students came
up with it and that's how i do it when

1034
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:24,720
up with it and that's how i do it when
 

1035
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,670
up with it and that's how i do it when
i'm in person

1036
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:25,680
i'm in person
 

1037
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,350
i'm in person
i also have another line of courses that

1038
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:27,360
i also have another line of courses that
 

1039
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,110
i also have another line of courses that
we make that is delivered online

1040
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,120
we make that is delivered online
 

1041
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,949
we make that is delivered online
those things are where i can't do it

1042
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:30,959
those things are where i can't do it
 

1043
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,470
those things are where i can't do it
live but

1044
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:32,480
live but
 

1045
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,470

it was just here's an interesting

1048
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:36,240
it was just here's an interesting

question
 

1051
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,470
question
i know it's out of reach why don't you

1052
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:38,480
i know it's out of reach why don't you
 

1053
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,470
i know it's out of reach why don't you
think about it and then automatic hints

1054
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:40,480
think about it and then automatic hints
 

1055
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,829
think about it and then automatic hints
we feed automatically hints

try to invent so that's like a more
 

1063
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,069
try to invent so that's like a more
rigorous prodding of invention

1064
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:52,079
rigorous prodding of invention
 

1065
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,430
rigorous prodding of invention
but you did mention disease and

interesting stuff from a mathematical
 

1071
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,829
interesting stuff from a mathematical
but also software engineering angle

i happen to be the one speaking but
 

1095
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,190
i happen to be the one speaking but
there's no way this would exist without

00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:29,200
there's no way this would exist without
 

1097
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,110
there's no way this would exist without
an incredible team of people who inspire

me every day to
 

1101
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,070
me every day to
work on this but i'll speak on behalf of

1102
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,080
work on this but i'll speak on behalf of
 

1103
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,070
work on this but i'll speak on behalf of
them so

1104
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,080
them so
 

1105
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,190
them so
the idea was indeed that we stepped

1106
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:39,200
the idea was indeed that we stepped
 

1107
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,070
the idea was indeed that we stepped
forward

1108
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
forward
 

1109
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,470
forward
in march of last year when the world

1110

in march of last year when the world
 

1111
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,070
in march of last year when the world
started to become our part of the world

1112
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:44,080
started to become our part of the world
 

1113
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,510
started to become our part of the world
started to become our part meaning the

00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:45,520
started to become our part meaning the
 

1115
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,310
started to become our part meaning the

united states
 

1117
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,950
united states
started to become paralyzed by coven the

1118
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:48,960
started to become paralyzed by coven the
 

1119
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,710
started to become paralyzed by coven the
shutdown started to happen

1120
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:50,720
shutdown started to happen
 

1121
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,590
shutdown started to happen
and at that time it started as a figment

1122
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:53,600
and at that time it started as a figment
 

1123
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,909
and at that time it started as a figment
of an idea which was

1124
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:55,919
of an idea which was
 

1125
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,390
of an idea which was
network theory which is the area of math

1126
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:58,400
network theory which is the area of math
 

1127
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,430
network theory which is the area of math
that i work in

could potentially be combined with
 

1131
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,590

health information anonymized exactly
how

1136
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:06,960
how
 

1137
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,230
how
we didn't know yet we tried to

1138
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:08,240
we didn't know yet we tried to
 

1139
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,950
we didn't know yet we tried to
crystallize it and many months into this

1140
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:10,960
crystallize it and many months into this
 

1141
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,350
crystallize it and many months into this
work

1142
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:11,360
work
 

1143
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,470
work
we ended up accidentally discovering

1144
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:14,480
we ended up accidentally discovering
 

1145
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,590
we ended up accidentally discovering
a new way to control diseases which

1146
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:17,600
a new way to control diseases which
 

1147
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,150
a new way to control diseases which
is now what is the main impetus of all

1148
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,160
is now what is the main impetus of all
 

1149
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,390
is now what is the main impetus of all
of this work is to take this idea

1150
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:22,400
of this work is to take this idea
 

1151
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,390
of this work is to take this idea
and polish it and hopefully have it be

1152
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:24,400
and polish it and hopefully have it be
 

1153
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,830
and polish it and hopefully have it be
useful not only now

1154
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:25,840
useful not only now
 

1155
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,750
useful not only now
but for future pandemics the idea is

1156
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:27,760
but for future pandemics the idea is
 

1157
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,190
but for future pandemics the idea is
really simple to describe

1158
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:29,200
really simple to describe
 

1159
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,029
really simple to describe
um actually my main thing in the world

1160
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:31,039
um actually my main thing in the world
 

1161
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,230
um actually my main thing in the world
is i come up with obvious

1162
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,240
is i come up with obvious
 

1163
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,630
is i come up with obvious
observations that's that's i'll explain

1164
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:34,640
observations that's that's i'll explain
 

1165
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,789
observations that's that's i'll explain
it now einstein did the same thing

1166
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:36,799
it now einstein did the same thing
 

1167
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,830
it now einstein did the same thing
and he wrote a few short papers

1168
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:39,840
and he wrote a few short papers
 

1169
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,390
and he wrote a few short papers
but but so the idea is like this if we

1170
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:42,400
but but so the idea is like this if we
 

1171
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,029
but but so the idea is like this if we
describe

1172
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:43,039
describe
 

1173
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,390
describe
how usually people control disease

1174
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:46,400
how usually people control disease
 

1175
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,190
how usually people control disease
for a lot of history it was that you'd

1176
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:49,200
for a lot of history it was that you'd
 

1177
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,830
for a lot of history it was that you'd
find out

1178
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:49,840
find out
 

1179
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,909
find out
who was sick you'd find out who they've

1180
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:51,919
who was sick you'd find out who they've
 

1181
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,190
who was sick you'd find out who they've
been around

1182
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,200
been around
 

1183
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,710
been around
and you try to remove all of those

1184
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:54,720
and you try to remove all of those
 

1185
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,110
and you try to remove all of those
people from society against their will

1186
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,120
people from society against their will
 

1187
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,430
people from society against their will
yes now that's the problem the against

1188
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,440
yes now that's the problem the against
 

1189
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,870
yes now that's the problem the against
the will part

1190
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:00,880
the will part
 

1191
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,029
the will part
gives you the wrong kind of a feedback

1192
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:03,039
gives you the wrong kind of a feedback
 

1193
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,950
gives you the wrong kind of a feedback
loop which makes it hard to control the

1194
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:04,960
loop which makes it hard to control the
 

1195
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,390
loop which makes it hard to control the
disease because then the people you're

1196
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:06,400
disease because then the people you're
 

1197
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,510
disease because then the people you're
trying to control keep getting other

1198
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:07,520
trying to control keep getting other
 

1199
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,630
trying to control keep getting other
people sick

1200
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:08,640
people sick
 

1201
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,150
people sick
you can see already how i'm thinking and

1202
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:10,160
you can see already how i'm thinking and
 

1203
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,990
you can see already how i'm thinking and
talking about this feedback loops this

1204
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,000
talking about this feedback loops this
 

1205
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,350
talking about this feedback loops this
is actually related to something you

1206
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:13,360
is actually related to something you
 

1207
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,150
is actually related to something you
said earlier

1208
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:14,160
said earlier
 

1209
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,070
said earlier
about even like how skyscrapers stay in

1210
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,080
about even like how skyscrapers stay in
 

1211
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,549
about even like how skyscrapers stay in
the air uh the whole point is

1212
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:18,559
the air uh the whole point is
 

1213
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,270
the air uh the whole point is
control theory you actually want to or

1214
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,280
control theory you actually want to or
 

1215
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,630
control theory you actually want to or
even how an airplane stays

1216
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:22,640
even how an airplane stays
 

1217
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,270
even how an airplane stays
you need to have control loops which are

1218
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:25,280
you need to have control loops which are
 

1219
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,029
you need to have control loops which are
feedbacking in the right way

1220
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:27,039
feedbacking in the right way
 

1221
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,630
feedbacking in the right way
and what we observed was that the

1222
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:28,640
and what we observed was that the
 

1223
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,310
and what we observed was that the
feedback control loop for

1224
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:30,320
feedback control loop for
 

1225
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,230
feedback control loop for
controlling disease by asking people to

1226
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:32,240
controlling disease by asking people to
 

1227
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,830
controlling disease by asking people to
be removed from society against their

1228
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:33,840
be removed from society against their
 

1229
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,390
be removed from society against their
will

1230
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:34,400
will
 

1231
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,630
will
was not working it was running against

1232
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:36,640
was not working it was running against
 

1233
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,310
was not working it was running against
human incentives and you suddenly are

1234
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:38,320
human incentives and you suddenly are
 

1235
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,669
human incentives and you suddenly are
trying to control seven

1236
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:39,679
trying to control seven
 

1237
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,750
trying to control seven
billion eight billion people in ways

1238
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:41,760
billion eight billion people in ways
 

1239
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,590

that they don't individually want

1240
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:43,600
that they don't individually want
 

1241
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,950
that they don't individually want
to necessarily do so here's the idea

1242
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:46,960
to necessarily do so here's the idea
 

1243
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,549
to necessarily do so here's the idea
and this is inspired by the fact that at

1244
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:48,559
and this is inspired by the fact that at
 

1245
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,150
and this is inspired by the fact that at
the core of our team were user

1246
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,160
the core of our team were user
 

1247
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,190
the core of our team were user
experience designers

1248
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,200
experience designers
 

1249
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,870
experience designers
that's actually the in fact the first

1250
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:52,880
that's actually the in fact the first
 

1251
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,470
that's actually the in fact the first
thing i knew we needed when we started

1252
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:54,480
thing i knew we needed when we started
 

1253
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,070
thing i knew we needed when we started
was to bring user experience

1254
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,080
was to bring user experience
 

1255
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,230
was to bring user experience
at the core okay but so um

1256
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,240
at the core okay but so um
 

1257
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,149
at the core okay but so um
the idea was suppose there was a penta

1258
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:02,159
the idea was suppose there was a penta
 

1259
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,830
the idea was suppose there was a penta
suppose hypothetically there was a

1260
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:03,840
suppose hypothetically there was a
 

1261
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,270
suppose hypothetically there was a
pandemic

1262
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:05,280
pandemic
 

1263
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,710
pandemic
what would you want you would want a way

1264
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:08,720
what would you want you would want a way
 

1265
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,789
what would you want you would want a way
to be able to live your life as much as

1266
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:10,799
to be able to live your life as much as
 

1267
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:11,830
to be able to live your life as much as
possible

1268
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:11,840
possible
 

1269
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,310
possible
and avoid getting sick can we make an

1270
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:14,320
and avoid getting sick can we make an
 

1271
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,190
and avoid getting sick can we make an
app to help

1272
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:15,200
app to help
 

1273
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,909
app to help
you avoid getting sick notice how i've

1274
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:17,919
you avoid getting sick notice how i've
 

1275
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,590
you avoid getting sick notice how i've
just articulated the problem

1276
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:19,600
just articulated the problem
 

1277
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,310
just articulated the problem
it is not can we make an app so that

1278
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:22,320
it is not can we make an app so that
 

1279
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,710
it is not can we make an app so that
after you are around somebody who's sick

1280
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:24,720
after you are around somebody who's sick
 

1281
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,350
after you are around somebody who's sick
you can be removed from society it's can

1282
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:27,360
you can be removed from society it's can
 

1283
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:27,909
you can be removed from society it's can
we make an

1284
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:27,919
we make an
 

1285
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,549
we make an
app so that you can avoid getting sick

1286
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:30,559
app so that you can avoid getting sick
 

1287
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,270
app so that you can avoid getting sick
that would

1288
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:31,280
that would
 

1289
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,750
that would
run a positive feed however i don't know

1290
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:33,760
run a positive feed however i don't know
 

1291
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,789
run a positive feed however i don't know
if i want to call it positive or

1292
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:34,799
if i want to call it positive or
 

1293
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:35,990
if i want to call it positive or
negative but they would run a good

1294
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,000
negative but they would run a good
 

1295
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,870
negative but they would run a good
feedback loop yes

1296
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:36,880
feedback loop yes
 

1297
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,870
feedback loop yes
okay so then how would you do this the

1298
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:38,880
okay so then how would you do this the
 

1299
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,070
okay so then how would you do this the
only problem is that

1300
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,080
only problem is that
 

1301
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,470
only problem is that
you don't know who's sick because

1302
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:42,480
you don't know who's sick because
 

1303
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,070
you don't know who's sick because
especially with this disease

1304
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,080
especially with this disease
 

1305
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,669
especially with this disease
if i see somebody who looks perfectly

1306
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:45,679
if i see somebody who looks perfectly
 

1307
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,310
if i see somebody who looks perfectly
healthy the disease spreads two days

1308
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:48,320
healthy the disease spreads two days
 

1309
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,990
healthy the disease spreads two days
before you have any symptoms

1310
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:50,000
before you have any symptoms
 

1311
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,470
before you have any symptoms
and so it's actually not possible that's

1312
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:52,480
and so it's actually not possible that's
 

1313
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,710
and so it's actually not possible that's
where the network theory comes in

1314
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:54,720
where the network theory comes in
 

1315
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,750
where the network theory comes in
you caught it from someone what if

1316
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:57,760
you caught it from someone what if
 

1317
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,149
you caught it from someone what if
we changed the paradigm and we said

1318
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:00,159
we changed the paradigm and we said
 

1319
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,390
we changed the paradigm and we said
whenever there's a sickness

1320
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,400

everyone that's a very strong statement
but a very large number of people

00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,120
but a very large number of people
 

1401
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,190
but a very large number of people
that's fascinating framing like the the

00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:25,200
that's fascinating framing like the the
 

1403
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,190
that's fascinating framing like the the
more deadly and transmissible the

good
 

1415
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,110
good
feedback loop sense that's a really good

1416
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:37,120
feedback loop sense that's a really good
 

1417
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,710
feedback loop sense that's a really good
example it's a really good way to frame

1418
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:38,720
example it's a really good way to frame
 

1419
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,350
example it's a really good way to frame
it because

1420
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:39,360
it because
 

1421
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,630
it because
with covet it was not as deadly

1422
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:42,640
with covet it was not as deadly
 

1423
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,110
with covet it was not as deadly
as uh as potential pandemics could have

1424
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,120
as uh as potential pandemics could have
 

1425
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,789
as uh as potential pandemics could have
been viruses could have been so

1426
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:46,799
been viruses could have been so
 

1427
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,710
been viruses could have been so
it's sometimes muddled with how we think

1428
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:48,720
it's sometimes muddled with how we think
 

1429
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,390
it's sometimes muddled with how we think
about it but yeah this is a really good

1430
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:50,400
about it but yeah this is a really good
 

1431
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,230
about it but yeah this is a really good
framing if the virus was a lot more

1432
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,240
framing if the virus was a lot more
 

1433
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,669

00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:55,360
you want to create a system that has a
 

1437
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,510
you want to create a system that has a

everybody is using it
and is contributing in a positive way to

00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:10,320
talked to who pointed out that
 

1455
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,230
talked to who pointed out that
it's very interesting that this feedback

1456
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:12,240
it's very interesting that this feedback
 

1457
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,549
it's very interesting that this feedback
loop is even more effective

1458
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:14,559
loop is even more effective
 

1459
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,350
loop is even more effective
when the disease is worse and that's

1460
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:17,360
when the disease is worse and that's
 

1461
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,070
when the disease is worse and that's
actually

1462
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,080
actually
 

1463
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,909
actually
not a bad characteristic to have in your

not a bad characteristic to have in your
 

1465
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,070
not a bad characteristic to have in your

00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:24,799
civilization keep running yeah it's a
 

1469
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:25,430
civilization keep running yeah it's a

00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:25,440
really
 

1471
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,470
really
it's in this dynamic like people

1472
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:28,480
it's in this dynamic like people
 

1473
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,390
it's in this dynamic like people
figure out they dynamically figure out

figure out they dynamically figure out
 

1475
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,830

how bad the disease is
the more it spreads and the deadlier it

1478
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:34,880
the more it spreads and the deadlier it
 

1479
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,070
the more it spreads and the deadlier it
is as the people observe

1480
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,080
is as the people observe
 

1481
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,669
is as the people observe
it as long as the spread of information

1482
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:39,679
it as long as the spread of information
 

1483
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,070
it as long as the spread of information

we that's we might maybe we'll chat

1494
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:50,480
we that's we might maybe we'll chat
 

1495
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,149
we that's we might maybe we'll chat
about that how we sort of

about that how we sort of
 

1497
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,669
about that how we sort of
make sure there's not misinformation

1498
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:53,679
make sure there's not misinformation
 

1499
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,510
make sure there's not misinformation
while there's accurate information but

while there's accurate information but
 

1501
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,990
while there's accurate information but
that aside okay so this is a really nice

00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:58,000
that aside okay so this is a really nice
 

1503
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,870

right and and just going on on that

1506
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:00,799
right and and just going on on that
 

1507
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,230
right and and just going on on that
actually just talking more about what

1508
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:02,240
actually just talking more about what
 

1509
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,750
actually just talking more about what
that could do and why we're so excited

1510
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:03,760
that could do and why we're so excited
 

1511
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,070
that could do and why we're so excited
about

about
 

1513
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,470
about
it it's that not only would people want

1514
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:06,480
it it's that not only would people want
 

1515
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,630
it it's that not only would people want

to install it
 

1517
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,710

what would they do if you start to see

1518
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:10,720
what would they do if you start to see
 

1519
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,630
what would they do if you start to see
that this disease is getting closer and

1520
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:12,640
that this disease is getting closer and
 

1521
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,630
that this disease is getting closer and
closer we we surveyed informally

1522
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:14,640
closer we we surveyed informally
 

1523
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,630
closer we we surveyed informally
people but they said as we saw getting

1524
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:16,640
people but they said as we saw getting
 

1525
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,149
people but they said as we saw getting
closer we would

1526
00:24:18,149 --> 00:24:18,159
closer we would
 

1527
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,669
closer we would
hide we would try to not have contacts

00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:21,679
hide we would try to not have contacts
 

1529
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,269
hide we would try to not have contacts
but now you notice what this has just

1530
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:23,279
but now you notice what this has just
 

1531
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,870
but now you notice what this has just
achieved the whole goal

1532
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:24,880
achieved the whole goal
 

1533
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,590

to separate set a from set b
 

1559
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,430
to separate set a from set b
you can also let the people at set b at

you can also let the people at set b at
 

1561

to let you know as the virus travels
 

1647
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,029
to let you know as the virus travels
through this network how close is it

1648
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:25,039
through this network how close is it
 

1649
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,149
through this network how close is it
getting to you

1650
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:26,159
getting to you
 

1651
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,070
getting to you
and the number of hops away it is on

1652
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,080
and the number of hops away it is on
 

1653

that network
 

1655
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,430
that network
is really powerful information that

1656
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:31,440
is really powerful information that
 

1657
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,909
is really powerful information that
creates a positive uh feedback loop

1658
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:33,919
creates a positive uh feedback loop
 

1659
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,830
creates a positive uh feedback loop
where you can act essentially

1660
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:36,840
where you can act essentially
 

1661

1667
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,950
nobody's telling you what to do which is
really important is decentralized

00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:46,960
really important is decentralized
 

1669
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,310
really important is decentralized

00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:50,320
and uh and not yeah whatever the
 

1671
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,149

opposite of authoritarian is

1672
00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:52,159
opposite of authoritarian is
 

1673
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,549
opposite of authoritarian is
but you get to sort of the american way

1674
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:54,559
but you get to sort of the american way
 

1675
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,390
but you get to sort of the american way
you get to choose to do it yourself you

1676
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:56,400
you get to choose to do it yourself you
 

1677
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,909
you get to choose to do it yourself you
have the freedom to do it

1678
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:57,919
have the freedom to do it
 

1679
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,590
have the freedom to do it
yourself and you're incentivized to do

1680
00:26:59,590 --> 00:26:59,600
yourself and you're incentivized to do
 

1681
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,830
yourself and you're incentivized to do
it and you're most likely going to do it

1682
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:01,840
it and you're most likely going to do it
 

1683
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,950
it and you're most likely going to do it
to to uh

1684
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:02,960
to to uh
 

1685
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,630
to to uh
to protect yourself against um

1686
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:06,640
to protect yourself against um
 

1687
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,789
to protect yourself against um
against you getting the disease as the

1688
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:08,799
against you getting the disease as the
 

1689
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,470
against you getting the disease as the
the closer it gets to you based on the

1690
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:10,480
the closer it gets to you based on the
 

1691
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,990
the closer it gets to you based on the
information that you have

1692
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:12,000
information that you have
 

1693
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,029
information that you have
but uh can you maybe elaborate uh first

1694
00:27:15,029 --> 00:27:15,039
but uh can you maybe elaborate uh first
 

1695
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,430
but uh can you maybe elaborate uh first
of all brilliant

1696
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:17,440
of all brilliant
 

1697
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,269
of all brilliant
uh whenever i saw the thing you're

1698
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:19,279
uh whenever i saw the thing you're
 

1699
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,590
uh whenever i saw the thing you're
working on so forget for covid

1700
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:21,600
working on so forget for covid
 

1701
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,230
working on so forget for covid
this is of course really relevant for

1702
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:24,240
this is of course really relevant for
 

1703
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,029
this is of course really relevant for
covid

1704
00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:25,039
covid
 

1705
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,950
covid
but it's also probably relevant for

1706
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:26,960
but it's also probably relevant for
 

1707
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,549
but it's also probably relevant for
future diseases as well so this

1708
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:28,559
future diseases as well so this
 

1709
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,470
future diseases as well so this
uh that was the thing i'm nervous about

1710
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:30,480
uh that was the thing i'm nervous about
 

1711
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,669
uh that was the thing i'm nervous about
like if this whole

1712
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:31,679
like if this whole
 

1713
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,750
like if this whole
if our society shut down because of

1714
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:33,760
if our society shut down because of
 

1715
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,710
if our society shut down because of
covid

1716
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:34,720
covid
 

1717
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,909
covid
like what the heck is gonna happen

1718
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:37,919
like what the heck is gonna happen
 

1719
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,389
like what the heck is gonna happen
when there's a much deadlier disease

1720
00:27:40,389 --> 00:27:40,399
when there's a much deadlier disease
 

1721
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:40,950
when there's a much deadlier disease
like this

1722
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:40,960
like this
 

1723
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,510
like this
this is disappointing the whole time

1724
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:43,520
this is disappointing the whole time
 

1725
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,350
this is disappointing the whole time
2020 the whole time i'm just sitting

1726
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:45,360
2020 the whole time i'm just sitting
 

1727
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:45,909
2020 the whole time i'm just sitting
like this

1728
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:45,919
like this
 

1729
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,029
like this
like is the incompetence of

1730
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:49,039
like is the incompetence of
 

1731
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,430
like is the incompetence of
everybody except the people developing

1732
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:51,440
everybody except the people developing
 

1733
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,549
everybody except the people developing
vaccines

1734
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:52,559
vaccines
 

1735
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,389
vaccines
uh the biologists are the only ones that

1736
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:54,399
uh the biologists are the only ones that
 

1737
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:55,909
uh the biologists are the only ones that
got their stuff together

1738
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:55,919
got their stuff together
 

1739
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,510
got their stuff together
but in terms of institutions and all

1740
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:57,520
but in terms of institutions and all
 

1741
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,190
but in terms of institutions and all
that kind of stuff oh it's just been

1742
00:27:59,190 --> 00:27:59,200
that kind of stuff oh it's just been
 

1743
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,710
that kind of stuff oh it's just been
it's just been terrible

1744
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:00,720
it's just been terrible
 

1745
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,789
it's just been terrible
but this is exactly the power of

1746
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:02,799
but this is exactly the power of
 

1747
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:03,990
but this is exactly the power of
information

1748
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:04,000
information
 

1749
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,070
information
and the power of information that

1750
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:06,080
and the power of information that
 

1751
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,909
and the power of information that
doesn't limit personal freedom

1752
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:07,919
doesn't limit personal freedom
 

1753
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,310
doesn't limit personal freedom
so your idea is brilliant okay

1754
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:10,320
so your idea is brilliant okay
 

1755
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,630
so your idea is brilliant okay
mathematically can you maybe elaborate

1756
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:12,640
mathematically can you maybe elaborate
 

1757
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,630
mathematically can you maybe elaborate
what are we talking about like how do

1758
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:14,640
what are we talking about like how do
 

1759
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,389
what are we talking about like how do
you actually make that work

1760
00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:16,399
you actually make that work
 

1761
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,630
you actually make that work
what's involved sure first i'm going to

1762
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:18,640
what's involved sure first i'm going to
 

1763
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,549
what's involved sure first i'm going to
reply to something you said about

1764
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:20,559
reply to something you said about
 

1765
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,430
reply to something you said about
the freedom inside this because actually

1766
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:23,440
the freedom inside this because actually
 

1767
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,029
the freedom inside this because actually
that was the idea the idea

1768
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:25,039
that was the idea the idea
 

1769
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,430
that was the idea the idea
is this is game theory right and

1770
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:27,440
is this is game theory right and
 

1771
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,630
is this is game theory right and
effectively what we did is analogous to

1772
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:30,640
effectively what we did is analogous to
 

1773
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,430
effectively what we did is analogous to
free market economy as opposed to

1774
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:33,440
free market economy as opposed to
 

1775
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,389
free market economy as opposed to
central planning

1776
00:28:34,389 --> 00:28:34,399
central planning
 

1777
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,549
central planning
yeah if you just line up the set of

1778
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:36,559
yeah if you just line up the set of
 

1779
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,070
yeah if you just line up the set of
incentives correctly

1780
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,080
incentives correctly
 

1781
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,669
incentives correctly
so that people have in their purely

1782
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:41,679
so that people have in their purely
 

1783
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,190
so that people have in their purely
selfish behavior

1784
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:43,200
selfish behavior
 

1785
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,590
selfish behavior
are contributing to the optimization of

1786
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:45,600
are contributing to the optimization of
 

1787
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,710
are contributing to the optimization of
the global function

1788
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:46,720
the global function
 

1789
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,870
the global function
yes that's it and the the point of what

1790
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:48,880
yes that's it and the the point of what
 

1791
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,870
yes that's it and the the point of what
we do i guess in mathematics is we try

1792
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:50,880
we do i guess in mathematics is we try
 

1793
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,630
we do i guess in mathematics is we try
to explore the search space

1794
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:52,640
to explore the search space
 

1795
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,389
to explore the search space
to go and find out as many possibilities

1796
00:28:54,389 --> 00:28:54,399
to go and find out as many possibilities
 

1797
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,909
to go and find out as many possibilities
as there are and in this case it's an

00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:55,919
as there are and in this case it's an
 

1799

apply
 

1801
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,669
apply
in this case it's an applied search

1802
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:57,679
in this case it's an applied search
 

1803
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,990
in this case it's an applied search
space that's why the inputs from design

1804
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:00,000
space that's why the inputs from design
 

1805
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,750
space that's why the inputs from design
user experience design and actual people

1806
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:01,760
user experience design and actual people
 

1807
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,549
user experience design and actual people
are important

1808
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:02,559
are important
 

1809
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,389
are important
but you asked about um i guess that the

1810
00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:04,399
but you asked about um i guess that the
 

1811
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,310
but you asked about um i guess that the
tech the mathematical or the technical

1812
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:06,320
tech the mathematical or the technical
 

1813
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:06,630
tech the mathematical or the technical
things

1814
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:06,640
things
 

1815
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,630
things
underpinning it so i think the first

1816
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:08,640
underpinning it so i think the first
 

1817
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,750
underpinning it so i think the first
thing i'll say is

1818
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:09,760
thing i'll say is
 

1819
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,190
thing i'll say is
we wanted to make this thing not require

1820
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:13,200
we wanted to make this thing not require
 

1821
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,710
we wanted to make this thing not require
your personal information

1822
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:14,720
your personal information
 

1823
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,870
your personal information
and so in order to do that what gave me

1824
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:16,880
and so in order to do that what gave me
 

1825
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,750
and so in order to do that what gave me
the confidence

1826
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:17,760
the confidence
 

1827
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,750
the confidence
to i guess lead our team to run at the

1828
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:19,760
to i guess lead our team to run at the
 

1829
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,510
to i guess lead our team to run at the
beginning is we saw that this could be

1830
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:21,520
beginning is we saw that this could be
 

1831
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,950
beginning is we saw that this could be
done without using gps information

1832
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:24,960
done without using gps information
 

1833
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,350
done without using gps information
so technically what's going on is if two

1834
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:27,360
so technically what's going on is if two
 

1835
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,070
so technically what's going on is if two
smartphones

1836
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:28,080
smartphones
 

1837
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,750
smartphones
it's a smartphone app if two smartphones

1838
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:29,760
it's a smartphone app if two smartphones
 

1839
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,430
it's a smartphone app if two smartphones
have this thing installed

1840
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:31,440
have this thing installed
 

1841
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,909
have this thing installed
they just communicate with each other by

1842
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:33,919
they just communicate with each other by
 

1843
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,269
they just communicate with each other by
bluetooth

1844
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:35,279
bluetooth
 

1845
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,230
bluetooth
to go and find out how far they can they

1846
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:38,240
to go and find out how far they can they
 

1847
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,149
to go and find out how far they can they
can detect nearby things by bluetooth

1848
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:40,159
can detect nearby things by bluetooth
 

1849
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,430
can detect nearby things by bluetooth
and then they can find out that these

1850
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:41,440
and then they can find out that these
 

1851
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,350
and then they can find out that these
two phones were approximately such and

1852
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:43,360
two phones were approximately such and
 

1853
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,789
two phones were approximately such and
such distance apart

1854
00:29:44,789 --> 00:29:44,799
such distance apart
 

1855
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,789
such distance apart
and that kind of relative proximity

1856
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:46,799
and that kind of relative proximity
 

1857
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,870
and that kind of relative proximity
information is enough to construct this

1858
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:48,880
information is enough to construct this
 

1859
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,549
information is enough to construct this
big network

1860
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:50,559
big network
 

1861
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,549
big network
okay so the physical network is

1862
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:52,559
okay so the physical network is
 

1863
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,389
okay so the physical network is
constructed based on proximity

1864
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:54,399
constructed based on proximity
 

1865
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,389
constructed based on proximity
that's through bluetooth and you don't

1866
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:56,399
that's through bluetooth and you don't
 

1867
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,909
that's through bluetooth and you don't
have to specify

1868
00:29:57,909 --> 00:29:57,919
have to specify
 

1869
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,029
have to specify
your exact location it's the proximity

1870
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:01,039
your exact location it's the proximity
 

1871
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,549
your exact location it's the proximity
i'm not using the pythagorean theorem

1872
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:02,559
i'm not using the pythagorean theorem
 

1873
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,950
i'm not using the pythagorean theorem
basically i mean if i just knew the gps

1874
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:04,960
basically i mean if i just knew the gps
 

1875
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,630
basically i mean if i just knew the gps
coordinates we could use the pythagorean

1876
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:06,640
coordinates we could use the pythagorean
 

1877
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,149
coordinates we could use the pythagorean
theorem too sorry that's just how i call

1878
00:30:08,149 --> 00:30:08,159
theorem too sorry that's just how i call
 

1879
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:08,389
theorem too sorry that's just how i call
it

1880
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:08,399
it
 

1881
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,590
it
distance formula whatever you want to

1882
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:09,600
distance formula whatever you want to
 

1883
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:09,930
distance formula whatever you want to
call it

1884
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:09,940
call it
 

1885
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:13,029
call it
[Laughter]

1886
00:30:13,029 --> 00:30:13,039
[Laughter]
 

1887
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,110
[Laughter]
uh yeah so we're not doing the old

1888
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:15,120
uh yeah so we're not doing the old
 

1889
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,710
uh yeah so we're not doing the old
pythagorean

1890
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:16,720
pythagorean
 

1891
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,670
pythagorean
based violation of privacy okay

1892
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:18,680
based violation of privacy okay
 

1893
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,190
based violation of privacy okay
[Laughter]

1894
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:21,200
[Laughter]
 

1895
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,389
[Laughter]
but so is that

1896
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:24,399
but so is that
 

1897
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,669
but so is that
is that enough to form to give you

1898
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:27,679
is that enough to form to give you
 

1899
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:27,990
is that enough to form to give you
enough

1900
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:28,000
enough
 

1901
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,190
enough
information about physical connection to

1902
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:31,200
information about physical connection to
 

1903
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,789
information about physical connection to
another human being

1904
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:32,799
another human being
 

1905
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,510
another human being
is there a time element there is there

1906
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:35,520
is there a time element there is there
 

1907
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,070
is there a time element there is there
so

1908
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:36,080
so
 

1909
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,830
so
okay that sounds like a really strong

1910
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:39,840
okay that sounds like a really strong
 

1911
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,070
okay that sounds like a really strong
like low hanging fruit like if you have

1912
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,080
like low hanging fruit like if you have
 

1913
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,669
like low hanging fruit like if you have
that you could probably go really really

1914
00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:43,679
that you could probably go really really
 

1915
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:44,789
that you could probably go really really
far

1916
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:44,799
far
 

1917
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,669
far
my natural question is is there extra

1918
00:30:47,669 --> 00:30:47,679
my natural question is is there extra
 

1919
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,669
my natural question is is there extra
information you can add on top of that

1920
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:49,679
information you can add on top of that
 

1921
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:49,990
information you can add on top of that
like

1922
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:50,000
like
 

1923
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,190
like
the duration of the physical proximity

1924
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:53,200
the duration of the physical proximity
 

1925
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,190
the duration of the physical proximity
uh so first of all we actually do

1926
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:55,200
uh so first of all we actually do
 

1927
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,549
uh so first of all we actually do
estimate the duration

1928
00:30:56,549 --> 00:30:56,559
estimate the duration
 

1929
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,470
estimate the duration
but the way we estimate the duration is

1930
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:58,480
but the way we estimate the duration is
 

1931
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,310
but the way we estimate the duration is
like how a movie is filmed

1932
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:00,320
like how a movie is filmed
 

1933
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,310
like how a movie is filmed
in the sense that every so often every

1934
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:02,320
in the sense that every so often every
 

1935
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,430
in the sense that every so often every
few minutes we

1936
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:03,440
few minutes we
 

1937
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,590
few minutes we
check what's nearby it's it's like how a

1938
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:05,600
check what's nearby it's it's like how a
 

1939
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,710
check what's nearby it's it's like how a
movie is filmed you take lots of

1940
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:06,720
movie is filmed you take lots of
 

1941
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,430
movie is filmed you take lots of
snapshots

1942
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:07,440
snapshots
 

1943
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,149
snapshots
yes so there's no way in a battery

1944
00:31:10,149 --> 00:31:10,159
yes so there's no way in a battery
 

1945
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,190
yes so there's no way in a battery
efficient way

1946
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:11,200
efficient way
 

1947
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,549
efficient way
to really keep track of that proximity

1948
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:14,559
to really keep track of that proximity
 

1949
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,149
to really keep track of that proximity
however fortunately we're using

00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:16,159
however fortunately we're using
 

1951
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,470
however fortunately we're using
probability the fact is

00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:18,480
probability the fact is
 

1953
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,470
probability the fact is
the paradigm that we're using is it's

the paradigm that we're using is it's
 

1955
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,909
the paradigm that we're using is it's
not super important

1956
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:21,919
not super important
 

1957
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,669
not super important
if you run into that person only for 10

1958
00:31:23,669 --> 00:31:23,679
if you run into that person only for 10
 

1959
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,509
if you run into that person only for 10
minutes at the grocery store

1960
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:25,519
minutes at the grocery store
 

1961
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,029
minutes at the grocery store
if that's a stranger that you run into

1962
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:27,039
if that's a stranger that you run into
 

1963
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,789
if that's a stranger that you run into
10 minutes in this grocery store

1964
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:28,799
10 minutes in this grocery store
 

1965
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,310
10 minutes in this grocery store
that's not going to be relevant for our

1966
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:30,320
that's not going to be relevant for our
 

1967
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,389
that's not going to be relevant for our
paradigm because our paradigm is not

that's going to come out in the problem
 

2003
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,430
that's going to come out in the problem
like statistically speaking it's going

2004
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:03,440
like statistically speaking it's going
 

2005
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,430
like statistically speaking it's going
to come out as a strong relationship and

in the grocery store is going to wash
 

2011
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,149
in the grocery store is going to wash
out that's not an important physical

i mean this is brilliant what uh

2016
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:14,320
i mean this is brilliant what uh
 

2017
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,070
i mean this is brilliant what uh
how difficult is it to make work so you

2018
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,080
how difficult is it to make work so you

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,830
how difficult is it to make work so you
said one there's a mathematical

2020
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:17,840
said one there's a mathematical
 

2021
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,870
said one there's a mathematical
component

2022
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:18,880
component
 

2023
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,269
component
that we just kind of talked about and

2024
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:21,279
that we just kind of talked about and
 

2025
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,789
that we just kind of talked about and
then there's the user experience

2026
00:32:22,789 --> 00:32:22,799
then there's the user experience
 

2027
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:23,990
then there's the user experience
component

2028
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:24,000
component
 

2029
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,310
component
so how difficult is it to go just like

2030
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:26,320
so how difficult is it to go just like
 

2031
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,590
so how difficult is it to go just like
you built the video game

2032
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:27,600

to completion what's involved how

2036
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:33,919
to completion what's involved how
 

2037
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:34,789
to completion what's involved how
difficult is it

2038
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:34,799
difficult is it
 

2039
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,789
difficult is it
so i'm going to answer that question in

2040
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:36,799
so i'm going to answer that question in
 

2041
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,190
so i'm going to answer that question in
terms of building the product

2042
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:39,200
terms of building the product
 

2043
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,789
terms of building the product
but then i'm also going to acknowledge

2044
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:40,799
but then i'm also going to acknowledge
 

2045
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,389
but then i'm also going to acknowledge
that just having an

2046
00:32:42,389 --> 00:32:42,399
that just having an
 

2047
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,590
that just having an
app doesn't make it useful because the

2048
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:45,600
app doesn't make it useful because the
 

2049
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,470
app doesn't make it useful because the
the that's actually maybe the easy part

2050
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:48,480
the that's actually maybe the easy part
 

2051
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,750
the that's actually maybe the easy part
if you know what i mean there's like all

2052
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:49,760
if you know what i mean there's like all
 

2053
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,350
if you know what i mean there's like all
of this stuff about rollout adoption and

2054
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:51,360
of this stuff about rollout adoption and
 

2055
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:51,909
of this stuff about rollout adoption and
awareness

2056
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:51,919
awareness
 

2057
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,750
awareness
but let's focus on the app part first so

2058
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:53,760
but let's focus on the app part first so
 

2059
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,110
but let's focus on the app part first so
that's again why i said

2060
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:55,120
that's again why i said
 

2061
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,110
that's again why i said
the team is incredible so we have a

the team is incredible so we have a
 

2063
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,149
the team is incredible so we have a
bunch of people

2064
00:32:58,149 --> 00:32:58,159
bunch of people
 

2065
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,350
bunch of people
who let's just say that the technology

2066
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:01,360
who let's just say that the technology
 

2067
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,630
who let's just say that the technology
that we use to make it

2068
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:02,640
that we use to make it
 

2069
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,870
that we use to make it
is not the standard way you make an app

2070
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:04,880
is not the standard way you make an app
 

2071
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,549
is not the standard way you make an app
if you think about a standard

2072
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:06,559
if you think about a standard

interface
that contacts a web server and sends

2078
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:12,320
that contacts a web server and sends
 

2079
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,909
that contacts a web server and sends
some information back and forth

2080
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:13,919
some information back and forth
 

2081
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,909
some information back and forth
we're doing some stuff that has to hook

2082
00:33:15,909 --> 00:33:15,919
we're doing some stuff that has to hook
 

2083
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,029
we're doing some stuff that has to hook
into the operating system

2084
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:17,039
into the operating system
 

2085
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,870
into the operating system
of saying let's go use bluetooth for

2086
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:18,880
of saying let's go use bluetooth for
 

2087
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,190
of saying let's go use bluetooth for
something it wasn't really meant for

2088
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:21,200
something it wasn't really meant for
 

2089
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,029
something it wasn't really meant for
right so there's that part and by the

2090
00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:23,039
right so there's that part and by the
 

2091
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,389
right so there's that part and by the
way what is the app called

2092
00:33:24,389 --> 00:33:24,399
way what is the app called
 

2093
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:28,630
way what is the app called
oh it's called novid covered with an ad

2094
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:28,640
oh it's called novid covered with an ad
 

2095
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,149
oh it's called novid covered with an ad
very nice so you have to hook into

2096
00:33:30,149 --> 00:33:30,159
very nice so you have to hook into

00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:43,360
permissions i just want to say that's
 

2111
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,350
permissions i just want to say that's
not what you usually do with bluetooth

2112
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:45,360
not what you usually do with bluetooth
 

2113
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:45,830
not what you usually do with bluetooth
gotcha

2114
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:45,840
gotcha
 

2115
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,070
gotcha
usually with bluetooth you say do i have

2116
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:48,080
usually with bluetooth you say do i have
 

2117
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,029
usually with bluetooth you say do i have
headphones nearby

2118
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:49,039
headphones nearby
 

2119
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,350
headphones nearby
yes okay i'm done you don't go and say

2120
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:51,360
yes okay i'm done you don't go and say
 

2121
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,269
yes okay i'm done you don't go and say
do i have headphones nearby

2122
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:53,279
do i have headphones nearby
 

2123
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,789
do i have headphones nearby
or do i have another phone nearby which

2124
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:54,799
or do i have another phone nearby which
 

2125
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,070
or do i have another phone nearby which
is doing something and then keep asking

2126
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:56,080
is doing something and then keep asking
 

2127
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,710
is doing something and then keep asking
that system keep

2128
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:56,720
that system keep
 

2129
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,350
that system keep
asking the question right so so this is

2130
00:33:59,350 --> 00:33:59,360
asking the question right so so this is
 

2131
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,710
asking the question right so so this is
actually not easy and

2132
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:00,720
actually not easy and
 

2133
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,789
actually not easy and
i mean there were some parts of it which

2134
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:02,799
i mean there were some parts of it which
 

2135
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,230
i mean there were some parts of it which
actually a lot of people had tried

2136
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:04,240
actually a lot of people had tried
 

2137
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,750
actually a lot of people had tried
unsuccessfully

2138
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:05,760
unsuccessfully
 

2139
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,990
unsuccessfully
actually it's known that for example the

2140
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,000
actually it's known that for example the
 

2141
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,790
actually it's known that for example the
uk was trying to do something

2142
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:10,800
uk was trying to do something
 

2143
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,950
uk was trying to do something
similar and the problem they ran into

2144
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:12,960
similar and the problem they ran into
 

2145
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,230
similar and the problem they ran into
was when you program things on ios

2146
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:16,240
was when you program things on ios
 

2147
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,510
was when you program things on ios
ios is very good at making it hard to do

2148
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:19,520
ios is very good at making it hard to do
 

2149
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,589
ios is very good at making it hard to do
things in the background

2150
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:21,599
things in the background
 

2151
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,190
things in the background
and so there was quite a lot of effort

2152
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:23,200
and so there was quite a lot of effort
 

2153
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,270
and so there was quite a lot of effort
required to go and make this thing work

2154
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:25,280
required to go and make this thing work
 

2155
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,190
required to go and make this thing work
so the whole point this thing would run

2156
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:27,200
so the whole point this thing would run
 

2157
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,790
so the whole point this thing would run
in the background and

2158
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:28,800
in the background and
 

2159
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,230
in the background and
ios i mean most

2160
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:32,240
ios i mean most
 

2161
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,069
ios i mean most
android probably as well right but yeah

2162
00:34:34,069 --> 00:34:34,079
android probably as well right but yeah
 

2163
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,589
android probably as well right but yeah
iowa certainly makes it difficult for

2164
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:35,599
iowa certainly makes it difficult for
 

2165
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:36,869
iowa certainly makes it difficult for
something to run in the background

2166
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:36,879
something to run in the background
 

2167
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,710
something to run in the background
especially when it's to eating up your

2168
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:38,720
especially when it's to eating up your
 

2169
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,069
especially when it's to eating up your
battery right

2170
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:40,079
battery right
 

2171
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,430
battery right
ah well we wanted to make sure we didn't

2172
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:41,440
ah well we wanted to make sure we didn't
 

2173
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,589
ah well we wanted to make sure we didn't
eat up the battery so that one we can we

2174
00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:43,599
eat up the battery so that one we can we
 

2175
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,950
eat up the battery so that one we can we
actually are very proud of the fact that

2176
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:44,960
actually are very proud of the fact that
 

2177
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,790
actually are very proud of the fact that
ours uses very little battery

2178
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:46,800
ours uses very little battery
 

2179
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,990
ours uses very little battery
uh actually even if compared to apple's

2180
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:50,000
uh actually even if compared to apple's
 

2181
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,030
uh actually even if compared to apple's
own system

2182
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:51,040
own system
 

2183
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,030
own system
so beautiful so what else is required to

2184
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:53,040
so beautiful so what else is required to
 

2185
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,470
so beautiful so what else is required to
make this thing work

2186
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:54,480
make this thing work
 

2187
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,470
make this thing work
right so the the key was that you had to

2188
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:56,480
right so the the key was that you had to
 

2189
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,310
right so the the key was that you had to
do significant amount of work on the

2190
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:58,320
do significant amount of work on the
 

2191
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,069
do significant amount of work on the
actual mobile app development

2192
00:35:00,069 --> 00:35:00,079
actual mobile app development
 

2193
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,670
actual mobile app development
which fortunately the team that we

2194
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:01,680
which fortunately the team that we
 

2195
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,270
which fortunately the team that we
brought was this kind of general

2196
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:03,280
brought was this kind of general
 

2197
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:03,990
brought was this kind of general
thinkers

2198
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:04,000
thinkers
 

2199
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,310
thinkers
where we would dig in deep into the

2200
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:06,320
where we would dig in deep into the
 

2201
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,990
where we would dig in deep into the
operating system documentation and the

2202
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:08,000
operating system documentation and the
 

2203
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,270
operating system documentation and the
api libraries

2204
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:09,280
api libraries
 

2205
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,790
api libraries
so we got that working but there's

2206
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:10,800
so we got that working but there's
 

2207
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,790
so we got that working but there's
another angle which is you also need the

2208
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:12,800
another angle which is you also need the
 

2209
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,230
another angle which is you also need the
servers to be able to compute fast

2210
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:14,240
servers to be able to compute fast
 

2211
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,870
servers to be able to compute fast
enough

2212
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:14,880
enough
 

2213
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,190
enough
which is tying back to this old school

2214
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:17,200
which is tying back to this old school
 

2215
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,790
which is tying back to this old school
computer programming competitions and

2216
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:18,800
computer programming competitions and
 

2217
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,990
computer programming competitions and
math olympiads

2218
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:20,000
math olympiads
 

2219
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,310
math olympiads
in fact our team that was working on the

2220
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:22,320
in fact our team that was working on the
 

2221
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,310
in fact our team that was working on the
algorithm and back-end side

2222
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:24,320
algorithm and back-end side
 

2223
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,870
algorithm and back-end side
included several people who had been in

2224
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:26,880
included several people who had been in
 

2225
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,589
included several people who had been in
these

2226
00:35:27,589 --> 00:35:27,599
these
 

2227
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,910
these
competitions from before which i happen

2228
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:29,920
competitions from before which i happen
 

2229
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,950
competitions from before which i happen
to know because i

2230
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:30,960
to know because i
 

2231
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,430
to know because i
i do coach the team for the math yes and

2232
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:33,440
i do coach the team for the math yes and
 

2233
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,950
i do coach the team for the math yes and
so we were able to bring people

2234
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:34,960
so we were able to bring people
 

2235
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,670
so we were able to bring people
in to build servers a server

2236
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:37,680
in to build servers a server
 

2237
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,550
in to build servers a server
infrastructure in

2238
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:38,560
infrastructure in
 

2239
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,349
infrastructure in
c plus actually so that we could support

2240
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:41,359
c plus actually so that we could support
 

2241
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,030
c plus actually so that we could support
significant numbers of people

2242
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,040
significant numbers of people
 

2243
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,670
significant numbers of people
without needing tons of servers is there

2244
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:45,680
without needing tons of servers is there
 

2245
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,190
without needing tons of servers is there
some distributed algorithms

2246
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:47,200
some distributed algorithms
 

2247
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,030
some distributed algorithms
working here or you basically have to

2248
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:49,040
working here or you basically have to
 

2249
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,310
working here or you basically have to
keep

2250
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:50,320
keep
 

2251
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,190
keep
in in the same place the entire graph as

2252
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:53,200
in in the same place the entire graph as
 

2253
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,630
in in the same place the entire graph as
it builds because

2254
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:54,640
it builds because
 

2255
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,069
it builds because
especially the more and more people use

2256
00:35:56,069 --> 00:35:56,079
especially the more and more people use
 

2257
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,150
especially the more and more people use
it the bigger the bigger the graph gets

2258
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:58,160
it the bigger the bigger the graph gets
 

2259
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,190
it the bigger the bigger the graph gets
i mean this is very difficult uh scaling

2260
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:01,200
i mean this is very difficult uh scaling
 

2261
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,230
i mean this is very difficult uh scaling
problem right

2262
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:02,240
problem right
 

2263
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,390
problem right
ah so that's actually why uh this

2264
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:04,400
ah so that's actually why uh this
 

2265
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,470
ah so that's actually why uh this
computer algorithm competition stuff was

2266
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:06,480
computer algorithm competition stuff was
 

2267
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,109
computer algorithm competition stuff was
handy

2268
00:36:07,109 --> 00:36:07,119
handy
 

2269
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,150
handy
it's because there are only about

2270
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:10,160
it's because there are only about
 

2271
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,870
it's because there are only about
seven to eight giga people in the world

2272
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:12,880
seven to eight giga people in the world
 

2273
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,910
seven to eight giga people in the world
yeah

2274
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:13,920
yeah
 

2275
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,750
yeah
that's not that many so if you can make

2276
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:15,760
that's not that many so if you can make
 

2277
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,990
that's not that many so if you can make
your algorithms linear time or almost

2278
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:18,000
your algorithms linear time or almost
 

2279
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,910
your algorithms linear time or almost
linear time

2280
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:19,920
linear time
 

2281
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,390
linear time
a computer operates in gigahertz yeah i

2282
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:22,400
a computer operates in gigahertz yeah i
 

2283
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,750
a computer operates in gigahertz yeah i
only need to do one run

2284
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:23,760
only need to do one run
 

2285
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,990
only need to do one run
one one recalculation every hour in

2286
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:26,000
one one recalculation every hour in
 

2287
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,750
one one recalculation every hour in
terms of telling people how far away

2288
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:27,760
terms of telling people how far away
 

2289
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,950
terms of telling people how far away
these dangers are

2290
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:28,960
these dangers are
 

2291
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,430
these dangers are
yes so i suddenly have 3600 seconds

2292
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:33,440
yes so i suddenly have 3600 seconds
 

2293
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,270
yes so i suddenly have 3600 seconds
and my cpu cores are running in

2294
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:35,280
and my cpu cores are running in
 

2295
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,870
and my cpu cores are running in
gigahertz and

2296
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:36,880
gigahertz and
 

2297
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,829
gigahertz and
at most they're eight giga people well

2298
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:39,839
at most they're eight giga people well
 

2299
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,990
at most they're eight giga people well
you're skipping over the fact that uh

2300
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:42,000
you're skipping over the fact that uh
 

2301
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,950
you're skipping over the fact that uh
there's n squared potential connections

2302
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:44,960
there's n squared potential connections
 

2303
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,790
there's n squared potential connections
between people

2304
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:46,800
between people
 

2305
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,550
between people
so how do you get around the fact that

2306
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:48,560
so how do you get around the fact that
 

2307
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,910
so how do you get around the fact that
uh

2308
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:49,920
uh
 

2309
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,430
uh
you know that we you know the potential

2310
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:53,440
you know that we you know the potential
 

2311
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,109
you know that we you know the potential
set of relationship any one of us could

2312
00:36:55,109 --> 00:36:55,119
set of relationship any one of us could
 

2313
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:55,510

have

2314
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:55,520
have
 

2315
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,150
have
8 billion so it's 8 billion times uh

2316
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:58,160
8 billion so it's 8 billion times uh
 

2317
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,109
8 billion so it's 8 billion times uh
squared

2318
00:36:59,109 --> 00:36:59,119
squared
 

2319
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,109
squared
that's you that's potential amount of

2320
00:37:01,109 --> 00:37:01,119
that's you that's potential amount of
 

2321
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,630
that's you that's potential amount of
data you have to be storing

updating so the way we dealt with that

2326
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:06,640
updating so the way we dealt with that
 

2327
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,990
updating so the way we dealt with that
is we actually expect

2328
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:08,000
is we actually expect
 

2329
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,710
is we actually expect
that the typical network is very sparse

2330
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:10,720
that the typical network is very sparse
 

2331
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,270
that the typical network is very sparse

the
 

2333
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,109
the
the technical term sparse would mean

2334
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:13,119
the technical term sparse would mean
 

2335
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,349
the technical term sparse would mean
that the average degree or the average

2339
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,630
number of connections that a person has
is going to be at most like 100 strong

2340
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:20,640
is going to be at most like 100 strong

2343
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,829

if you if you think of it almost in

2344
00:37:23,829 --> 00:37:23,839
if you if you think of it almost in
 

2345
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,990
if you if you think of it almost in

2346
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:26,000
terms of the heavy hitters actually
 

2347
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,349
terms of the heavy hitters actually
in most people's lives 100 if we just

2348
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:29,359
in most people's lives 100 if we just
 

2349
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,190
in most people's lives 100 if we just
kept track of their top 100

2350
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:31,200
kept track of their top 100
 

2351
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,349
kept track of their top 100
interactions that's probably most of the

00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:39,119
yeah yeah i i i'm saddened to think
 

2357
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,870
yeah yeah i i i'm saddened to think
that i might not be even in a double

2358
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:40,880
that i might not be even in a double
 

2359
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,310
that i might not be even in a double
digits but oh

2360
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:42,320
digits but oh
 

2361
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,310
digits but oh
i i was intentionally giving a crazy

2362
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:44,320
i i was intentionally giving a crazy
 

2363
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,910
i i was intentionally giving a crazy
number to account for college students

2364
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:47,920

 

2365
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,109

you call oh those are the who you're

2366
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:49,119
you call oh those are the who you're
 

2367
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,390
you call oh those are the who you're
calling the heavy hitters the people who

2368
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:50,400
calling the heavy hitters the people who
 

2369
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,990
calling the heavy hitters the people who
are like the social butterflies

2370
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:52,000
are like the social butterflies
 

2371
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,109
are like the social butterflies
yeah yeah yeah i need to uh um i'd love

2372
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:55,119
yeah yeah yeah i need to uh um i'd love
 

2373
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,950
yeah yeah yeah i need to uh um i'd love
to know that information about myself by

2374
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:56,960
to know that information about myself by
 

2375
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,790
to know that information about myself by
the way the

00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:58,800
the way the
 

2377
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,829
the way the
that i do do you uh expose the graph

2378
00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:01,839
that i do do you uh expose the graph
 

2379
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,550
that i do do you uh expose the graph
like how many like about yourself how

2380
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:04,560
like how many like about yourself how
 

2381
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,990
like how many like about yourself how
many connections you have

2382
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:06,000
many connections you have
 

2383
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,230
many connections you have
we do expose to each person how many

2384
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:08,240
we do expose to each person how many
 

2385
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,750
we do expose to each person how many
direct connections they have that's

2386
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:09,760
direct connections they have that's
 

2387
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,510
direct connections they have that's
great but for privacy purposes

2388
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:11,520
great but for privacy purposes
 

2389
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,349
great but for privacy purposes
we don't tell anybody who their

2390
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:13,359
we don't tell anybody who their
 

2391
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,030
we don't tell anybody who their
connections like how their connections

2392
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:15,040
connections like how their connections
 

2393
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,790
connections like how their connections
are interconnected yes gotcha

2394
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:16,800
are interconnected yes gotcha
 

2395
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,710
are interconnected yes gotcha
but at the same time we do expose also

2396
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:18,720
but at the same time we do expose also
 

2397
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,310
but at the same time we do expose also
to everyone an interesting chart that

2398
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:20,320
to everyone an interesting chart that
 

2399
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:20,870
to everyone an interesting chart that
says

2400
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:20,880
says
 

2401
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,790
says
here's how many people you have that

2402
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:22,800
here's how many people you have that
 

2403
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,310
here's how many people you have that
you're connected to directly

2404
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:24,320
you're connected to directly
 

2405
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,870
you're connected to directly
here's how many at distance two meaning

2406
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:26,880
here's how many at distance two meaning
 

2407
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,349
here's how many at distance two meaning
via

2408
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:27,359
via
 

2409
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:28,630
via
people and then here's how many at

2410
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:28,640
people and then here's how many at
 

2411
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,790
people and then here's how many at
distance three and the reason we do that

2412
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:30,800
distance three and the reason we do that
 

2413
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,790
distance three and the reason we do that
is that actually ends up being a dynamic

2414
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:32,800
is that actually ends up being a dynamic
 

2415
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,710
is that actually ends up being a dynamic
that also boosts adoption it drives

2416
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:34,720
that also boosts adoption it drives
 

2417
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,150
that also boosts adoption it drives
another feedback loop

2418
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:36,160
another feedback loop
 

2419
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,910
another feedback loop
the reason is because we saw actually

2420
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:37,920
the reason is because we saw actually
 

2421
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,349
the reason is because we saw actually
when we deployed this in some

2422
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:39,359
when we deployed this in some
 

2423
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,390
when we deployed this in some
universities

2424
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:40,400
universities
 

2425
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,870
universities
that when people see on their app that

2426
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:42,880
that when people see on their app that
 

2427
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,750
that when people see on their app that
they are

2428
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:43,760
they are
 

2429
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,069
they are
indirectly connected to hundreds or

2430
00:38:46,069 --> 00:38:46,079
indirectly connected to hundreds or
 

2431
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,349
indirectly connected to hundreds or
thousands of other people

2432
00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:47,359
thousands of other people
 

2433
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,710
thousands of other people
they get excited and they tell other

2434
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:48,720
they get excited and they tell other
 

2435
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,550
they get excited and they tell other
people hey let's download this app yeah

2436
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:50,560
people hey let's download this app yeah
 

2437
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,990
people hey let's download this app yeah
but you know we also saw in those

2438
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:52,000
but you know we also saw in those
 

2439
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,750
but you know we also saw in those
examples especially looking at the

2440
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:53,760
examples especially looking at the
 

2441
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,430
examples especially looking at the
screenshots people gave

2442
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:55,440
screenshots people gave
 

2443
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,750
screenshots people gave
that is hit as soon as the typical

because that means that our app has

2452
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:04,560
because that means that our app has
 

2453
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,750
because that means that our app has
reached a virality

are not of two to three the key is we

2456
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:08,160
are not of two to three the key is we
 

2457
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,790
are not of two to three the key is we
were making a viral app to fight a virus

2458
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:10,800
were making a viral app to fight a virus
 

2459
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,710
were making a viral app to fight a virus
spreading on the same network that the

2460
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:12,720
spreading on the same network that the
 

2461
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,710
spreading on the same network that the
virus spreads out

2462
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:14,720
virus spreads out
 

2463
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,950
virus spreads out
so you're trying to out virus the virus

2464
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:16,960
so you're trying to out virus the virus
 

2465
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,630
so you're trying to out virus the virus
that's right

2466
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:18,640
that's right
 

2467
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,510
that's right
that's exactly right okay great what

2468
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:21,520
that's exactly right okay great what
 

2469
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,310
that's exactly right okay great what
have you learned

2470
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:22,320
have you learned
 

2471
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,390
have you learned
from this whole experience in terms of

2472
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:24,400
from this whole experience in terms of

um
let's say for covid but for future

let's say for covid but for future
 

2477
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,829
let's say for covid but for future
pandemics as well

2478
00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:29,839
pandemics as well

00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:32,720
is it possible to use the power

or do you still have to have most like

2494
00:39:49,109 --> 00:39:49,119
or do you still have to have most like

in this overarching policy of everybody
 

2497
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,990
in this overarching policy of everybody
should stay at home

2498
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:52,000
should stay at home
 

2499
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,150
should stay at home
all that kind of thing we are trying to

2500
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:54,160
all that kind of thing we are trying to
 

2501
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,349
all that kind of thing we are trying to
answer that question right now

2502
00:39:55,349 --> 00:39:55,359
answer that question right now
 

2503
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,589
answer that question right now
so the answer is we don't know yet but

2504
00:39:57,589 --> 00:39:57,599
so the answer is we don't know yet but
 

2505
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,190
so the answer is we don't know yet but
that's actually why we're very happy

2506
00:39:59,190 --> 00:39:59,200
that's actually why we're very happy
 

2507
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,270
that's actually why we're very happy
that now the idea has started to become

2508
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:01,280
that now the idea has started to become
 

2509
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,630
that now the idea has started to become
become more widely known

2510
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:02,640
become more widely known
 

2511
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,829
become more widely known
and we're already starting to

2512
00:40:03,829 --> 00:40:03,839
and we're already starting to
 

2513
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,390
and we're already starting to
collaborate with epidemiologists

2514
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:06,400
collaborate with epidemiologists
 

2515
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,109
collaborate with epidemiologists
again i'm just a mathematician right and

2516
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:09,119
again i'm just a mathematician right and
 

2517
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,870
again i'm just a mathematician right and
a mathematician should not be the person

2518
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:10,880
a mathematician should not be the person
 

2519
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,230
a mathematician should not be the person
who is telling everybody

2520
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:12,240
who is telling everybody
 

2521
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,470
who is telling everybody
this will definitely work but because of

2522
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:14,480
this will definitely work but because of
 

2523
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,230
this will definitely work but because of
the potential power

2524
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:16,240
the potential power
 

2525
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,230
the potential power
of this approach especially the

of real researchers and we're now
 

2535
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,589
of real researchers and we're now
working together

2536
00:40:27,589 --> 00:40:27,599
working together
 

2537
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,349
working together
to try to actually understand the answer

2538
00:40:29,349 --> 00:40:29,359
to try to actually understand the answer
 

2539
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:30,870
to try to actually understand the answer
to that question because you see

2540
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:30,880
to that question because you see
 

2541
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,870
to that question because you see
there's a theory so what i can share is

2542
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:32,880
there's a theory so what i can share is
 

2543
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,990
there's a theory so what i can share is
the mathematics of

2544
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:34,000
the mathematics of
 

2545
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,670
the mathematics of
here's why there's some hope that this

2546
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:35,680
here's why there's some hope that this
 

2547
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,990
here's why there's some hope that this
would work yeah and that's because

2548
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:38,000
would work yeah and that's because
 

2549
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,750
would work yeah and that's because
i'm talking about end game now end game

means you have very few cases

2552
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:41,520
means you have very few cases
 

2553
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,430
means you have very few cases
but everywhere we're always thinking

2554
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:43,440
but everywhere we're always thinking
 

2555
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,870
but everywhere we're always thinking
once there's few cases then does that

2556
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:44,880
once there's few cases then does that
 

2557
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,390
once there's few cases then does that
mean we now open up

2558
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:46,400
mean we now open up
 

2559
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,230
mean we now open up
once you open up in the past then the

2560
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:48,240
once you open up in the past then the
 

2561
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,510
once you open up in the past then the
cases go up again

2562
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:49,520
cases go up again
 

2563
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,349
cases go up again
until you have to lock down again yeah

2564
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:51,359
until you have to lock down again yeah
 

2565
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,109
until you have to lock down again yeah
and now when we talk about the dynamic

2566
00:40:53,109 --> 00:40:53,119
and now when we talk about the dynamic
 

2567
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,069
and now when we talk about the dynamic
process that makes

2568

it's guaranteeing you always have cases

2570
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:55,839
it's guaranteeing you always have cases
 

2571
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,270
it's guaranteeing you always have cases
until you have the great vaccines which

2572
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:57,280
until you have the great vaccines which
 

2573
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:57,510
until you have the great vaccines which
is

2574
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:57,520
is
 

2575
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,510
is
you know we both got vaccinated this is

2576
00:40:59,510 --> 00:40:59,520
you know we both got vaccinated this is
 

2577
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,670
you know we both got vaccinated this is
this is good but at the same time why

2578
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:01,680
this is good but at the same time why
 

2579
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,589
this is good but at the same time why
i'm thinking this is still important is

2580
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:03,599
i'm thinking this is still important is
 

2581
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:04,630
i'm thinking this is still important is
because we know that

2582
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:04,640
because we know that
 

2583
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,630
because we know that
many vaccine makers have said they're

2584
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:06,640
many vaccine makers have said they're
 

2585
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,670
many vaccine makers have said they're
preparing for the next dose next year

2586
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:09,680
preparing for the next dose next year
 

2587
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,750
preparing for the next dose next year
and if we have a perpetual thing where

2588
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:11,760
and if we have a perpetual thing where
 

2589
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,750
and if we have a perpetual thing where
you just always need a new vaccine every

2590
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:13,760
you just always need a new vaccine every
 

2591
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,390
you just always need a new vaccine every
year

2592
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:14,400
year
 

2593
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,990
year
it could actually be beneficial to make

2594
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:16,000
it could actually be beneficial to make
 

2595
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,990
it could actually be beneficial to make
sure we have as many other techniques as

2596
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:18,000
sure we have as many other techniques as
 

2597
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,710
sure we have as many other techniques as
possible

2598
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:18,720
possible
 

2599
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,790
possible
for parts of the world that can't afford

2600
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:20,800
for parts of the world that can't afford
 

2601
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,990
for parts of the world that can't afford
for example

2602
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:22,000
for example
 

2603
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,510
for example
that kind of distribution yeah so

2604
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:23,520
that kind of distribution yeah so
 

2605
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,349
that kind of distribution yeah so
actually no matter no matter how deadly

2606
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:25,359
actually no matter no matter how deadly
 

2607
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:26,230
actually no matter no matter how deadly
the virus is

2608
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:26,240
the virus is
 

2609
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,990
the virus is
no matter how many things whether you

2610
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:28,000
no matter how many things whether you
 

2611
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,589
no matter how many things whether you
have a vaccine or not

2612
00:41:29,589 --> 00:41:29,599
have a vaccine or not
 

2613
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,270
have a vaccine or not
it's still useful to be having this

2614
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:31,280
it's still useful to be having this
 

2615
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,710
it's still useful to be having this
information yes because

2616
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:32,720
information yes because
 

2617
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,630
information yes because
to stay home or not depending on how

2618
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:34,640
to stay home or not depending on how
 

2619
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,750
to stay home or not depending on how
risky like

2620
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:35,760
risky like
 

2621
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,750
risky like
i'm a big fan just like you said of uh

2622
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:37,760
i'm a big fan just like you said of uh
 

2623
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,030
i'm a big fan just like you said of uh
having the freedom

2624
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:39,040
having the freedom
 

2625
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,190
having the freedom
for you to decide how risk-averse you

2626
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:41,200
for you to decide how risk-averse you
 

2627
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,630
for you to decide how risk-averse you
want to be right

2628
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:42,640
want to be right
 

2629
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,470
want to be right
and depending on your own conditions but

2630
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:44,480
and depending on your own conditions but
 

2631
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,190
and depending on your own conditions but
also on the state of like what you

2632
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:47,200
also on the state of like what you
 

2633
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,230
also on the state of like what you
just how dangerously you like to live so

2634
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:50,240
just how dangerously you like to live so
 

2635
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,510
just how dangerously you like to live so
i think that actually makes a lot of

2636
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:51,520
i think that actually makes a lot of
 

2637
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,349
i think that actually makes a lot of
sense and i also think that

2638
00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:53,359
sense and i also think that
 

2639
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,670
sense and i also think that
um since we're when we when you think of

2640
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:55,680
um since we're when we when you think of
 

2641
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,870
um since we're when we when you think of
disease spreading

2642
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:56,880
disease spreading
 

2643
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,349
disease spreading
it spreads in aggregate in the sense

2644
00:41:59,349 --> 00:41:59,359
it spreads in aggregate in the sense
 

2645
00:41:59,359 --> 00:41:59,910
it spreads in aggregate in the sense
that

2646
00:41:59,910 --> 00:41:59,920
that
 

2647
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,390
that
uh if there are some people who maybe

2648
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:02,400
uh if there are some people who maybe
 

2649
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,750
uh if there are some people who maybe
are more

2650
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:03,760
are more
 

2651
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,510
are more
risk tolerant because of other things in

2652
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:05,520
risk tolerant because of other things in
 

2653
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,510
risk tolerant because of other things in
their life well there might also be

2654
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:07,520
their life well there might also be
 

2655
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,390
their life well there might also be
other people who are

2656
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:08,400
other people who are
 

2657
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,309
other people who are
less risk tolerance and then those

2658
00:42:10,309 --> 00:42:10,319
less risk tolerance and then those
 

2659
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,910
less risk tolerance and then those
people decide to

2660
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:11,920
people decide to
 

2661
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,829
people decide to
isolate but what matters is in the

2662
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:13,839
isolate but what matters is in the
 

2663
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:15,670
isolate but what matters is in the
aggregate that this are naught of the

2664
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:15,680
aggregate that this are naught of the
 

2665
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,630
aggregate that this are naught of the
infection

2666
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:16,640
infection
 

2667
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,270
infection
uh spreading drops below one and so the

2668
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:19,280
uh spreading drops below one and so the
 

2669
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,109
uh spreading drops below one and so the
key is if you if you can empower people

2670
00:42:21,109 --> 00:42:21,119
key is if you if you can empower people
 

2671
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,349
key is if you if you can empower people
with that power to make that decision

2672
00:42:23,349 --> 00:42:23,359
with that power to make that decision
 

2673
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,710
with that power to make that decision
you might actually still be able to

2674
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:24,720
you might actually still be able to
 

2675
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,589
you might actually still be able to
drive that are not down below one

2676
00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:27,599
drive that are not down below one
 

2677
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,870
drive that are not down below one
yeah and also this is me talking i

2678
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:30,880
yeah and also this is me talking i
 

2679
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,950
yeah and also this is me talking i
yes people get a little bit nervous i

2680
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:32,960
yes people get a little bit nervous i
 

2681
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,950
yes people get a little bit nervous i
think

2682
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:34,960
think
 

2683
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,190
think
with uh information somehow mapping to

2684
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:37,200
with uh information somehow mapping to
 

2685
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,950
with uh information somehow mapping to
privacy violation but

2686
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:38,960
privacy violation but
 

2687
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,950
privacy violation but
i i first of all in the approach you're

2688
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:40,960
i i first of all in the approach you're
 

2689
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,230
i i first of all in the approach you're
describing

2690
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:42,240
describing
 

2691
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,309
describing
that's respecting anonymity

2692
00:42:46,309 --> 00:42:46,319
that's respecting anonymity
 

2693
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:49,190
that's respecting anonymity
but i would love to have information

2694
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:49,200
but i would love to have information
 

2695
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,230
but i would love to have information
from the very beginning

2696
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:50,240
from the very beginning
 

2697
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,990
from the very beginning
from march and april of last year

2698
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:54,000
from march and april of last year
 

2699
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,230
from march and april of last year
almost like a map of like where

2700
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:58,240
almost like a map of like where
 

2701
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,510
almost like a map of like where
it's risky and where it's not to go

2702
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:01,520
it's risky and where it's not to go
 

2703
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,309
it's risky and where it's not to go
and not map based on sort of the exact

2704
00:43:04,309 --> 00:43:04,319
and not map based on sort of the exact
 

2705
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,750
and not map based on sort of the exact
location of people but where people

2706
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:05,760
location of people but where people
 

2707
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,510
location of people but where people
usually hang out kind of thing

2708
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:07,520
usually hang out kind of thing
 

2709
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,990

blind and then what you had
 

2731
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,390
blind and then what you had
is a very imperfect signal which is like

2732

is a very imperfect signal which is like
 

2733
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,150
is a very imperfect signal which is like
basically politicians

is as much an art as a science you're
 

2755

which nobody can do

2758
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:57,920
which nobody can do
 

2759
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,589
which nobody can do
and then you're trying to speak with

2760
00:43:59,589 --> 00:43:59,599
and then you're trying to speak with
 

2761
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,109
and then you're trying to speak with
some level of authority

2762
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:01,119
some level of authority
 

2763
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,870
some level of authority
i mean if i were to criticize scientists

2764
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:02,880
i mean if i were to criticize scientists
 

2765
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,390
i mean if i were to criticize scientists
they spoke with too much authority

2766
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:04,400
they spoke with too much authority
 

2767
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,430
they spoke with too much authority
it's okay to say i'm not sure but then

2768
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:07,440
it's okay to say i'm not sure but then
 

2769
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,550
it's okay to say i'm not sure but then
they think like if i say i'm not sure

2770
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:10,560
they think like if i say i'm not sure
 

2771
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,470
they think like if i say i'm not sure
then there's going to be a distrust what

2772
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:12,480
then there's going to be a distrust what
 

2773
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,069
then there's going to be a distrust what
they realize is when you're wrong and

2774
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:14,079
they realize is when you're wrong and
 

2775
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,030
they realize is when you're wrong and
you say i'm sure

2776

you say i'm sure
 

2777
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,870
you say i'm sure
it's going to lead to more distrust so

2778
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:16,880
it's going to lead to more distrust so
 

2779
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,550
it's going to lead to more distrust so
there's this imperfect like

2780
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:18,560
there's this imperfect like
 

2781
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,150
there's this imperfect like
just chaotic messy system of people

2782
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:22,160
just chaotic messy system of people
 

2783
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,390
just chaotic messy system of people
trying to figure out with very little

2784
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:24,400
trying to figure out with very little
 

2785
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,349
trying to figure out with very little
information

2786
00:44:25,349 --> 00:44:25,359
information
 

2787
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:27,430
information
and what you're proposing is just a huge

2788
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:27,440
and what you're proposing is just a huge
 

2789
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,710
and what you're proposing is just a huge
amount of information

00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:28,720
amount of information
 

2791
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,470
amount of information
and information is power is there um

2792
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:32,480
and information is power is there um
 

2793
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,950
and information is power is there um
challenges with adoption that you see in

2794
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:34,960
challenges with adoption that you see in
 

2795
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,670
challenges with adoption that you see in
the future

2796
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:35,680
the future
 

2797
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,589
the future
here so there's uh maybe we could speak

2798
00:44:37,589 --> 00:44:37,599
here so there's uh maybe we could speak
 

2799
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,829
here so there's uh maybe we could speak
to there's approaches i guess from

2800
00:44:39,829 --> 00:44:39,839
to there's approaches i guess from
 

2801
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:40,390
to there's approaches i guess from
google

2803
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,790

there's different people that have tried

2804
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:42,800
there's different people that have tried
 

2805
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,790
there's different people that have tried
similar kind of ideas

2806
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:44,800
similar kind of ideas
 

2807
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,710
similar kind of ideas
not in you have a quite a novel idea

contact tracing
 

2815
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,829
contact tracing
is is there is there something you can

00:44:57,829 --> 00:44:57,839
is is there is there something you can
 

2817
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:58,870
is is there is there something you can
comment about

2818

comment about
 

2819
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,710
comment about
why their approaches haven't been fully

2820
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:00,720
why their approaches haven't been fully
 

2821
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,910
why their approaches haven't been fully
adopted

2822
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:01,920
adopted
 

2823
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,990
adopted
is there challenges there is there is

2824
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:04,000
is there challenges there is there is
 

2825
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,670
is there challenges there is there is
there reasons why novid might be a

2826
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:05,680
there reasons why novid might be a
 

2827
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,349
there reasons why novid might be a
better idea moving forward

2828
00:45:07,349 --> 00:45:07,359
better idea moving forward
 

2829
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,750
better idea moving forward
in general just about adoption yeah so

2830
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:09,760
in general just about adoption yeah so
 

2831
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,030
in general just about adoption yeah so
first of all i want to say i always have

2832
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:11,040
first of all i want to say i always have
 

2833
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:11,910
first of all i want to say i always have
respect for the

2834
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:11,920
respect for the
 

2835
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,589
respect for the
methods that other people use and so

2836
00:45:13,589 --> 00:45:13,599
methods that other people use and so
 

2837
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,030
methods that other people use and so
it's good to see that other people have

2838
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:15,040
it's good to see that other people have
 

2839
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:15,990
it's good to see that other people have
been trying

2840
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:16,000
been trying
 

2841
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,550
been trying
but what we have noticed is that the

2842
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:18,560
but what we have noticed is that the
 

2843
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,550
but what we have noticed is that the
difference between our

2844
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:20,560
difference between our
 

2845
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,550
difference between our
value proposition to the user and the

2846
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:22,560
value proposition to the user and the
 

2847
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,230
value proposition to the user and the
value proposition to the user delivered

2848
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:24,240
value proposition to the user delivered
 

2849
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,390
value proposition to the user delivered
by everything that was made before

2850
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:26,400
by everything that was made before
 

2851
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,670
by everything that was made before
is that unfortunately the action of

2852
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:29,680
is that unfortunately the action of
 

2853
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,390
is that unfortunately the action of
installing

2854
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:30,400
installing
 

2855
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,670
installing
a standard contact tracing app will then

2856
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:33,680
a standard contact tracing app will then
 

2857
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,470
a standard contact tracing app will then
tell you

2858
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:34,480
tell you
 

2859
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,470
tell you
after you have already been exposed to

2860
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:36,480
after you have already been exposed to
 

2861
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,670
after you have already been exposed to
the disease

2862
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:37,680
the disease
 

2863
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,510
the disease
so that you can protect other people

2864
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:39,520
so that you can protect other people
 

2865
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,069
so that you can protect other people
from you and what that does to your

2866
00:45:42,069 --> 00:45:42,079
from you and what that does to your
 

2867
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:44,550
from you and what that does to your
own direct probability of getting sick

2868
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:44,560
own direct probability of getting sick
 

2869
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,589
own direct probability of getting sick
if you think about it

2870
00:45:45,589 --> 00:45:45,599
if you think about it
 

2871
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,109
if you think about it
suppose you were making the decision

2872
00:45:47,109 --> 00:45:47,119
suppose you were making the decision
 

2873
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,790
suppose you were making the decision
should i or should i not install one of

2874
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:48,800
should i or should i not install one of
 

2875
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,510
should i or should i not install one of
those apps

2876
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:49,520
those apps
 

2877
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,589
those apps
yeah what does that do to your own

2878
00:45:51,589 --> 00:45:51,599
yeah what does that do to your own
 

2879
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,790
yeah what does that do to your own
probability of getting sick

2880
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:54,800
probability of getting sick
 

2881
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,349
probability of getting sick
it's close to zero this is uh the sad

2882
00:45:57,349 --> 00:45:57,359
it's close to zero this is uh the sad
 

2883
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:57,990
it's close to zero this is uh the sad
thing you're

2884
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:58,000
thing you're
 

2885
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,109
thing you're
um you're speaking to not sad i suppose

2886
00:46:01,109 --> 00:46:01,119
um you're speaking to not sad i suppose
 

2887
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:03,190
um you're speaking to not sad i suppose
it's the way the world is

2888
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:03,200
it's the way the world is
 

2889
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,430
it's the way the world is
the only incentive there is to just help

2890
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:05,440
the only incentive there is to just help
 

2891
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,829
the only incentive there is to just help
other people i suppose but

2892
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:07,839
other people i suppose but
 

2893
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:11,190
other people i suppose but
a much stronger incentive is is anything

2894
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:11,200
a much stronger incentive is is anything
 

2895
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:11,510
a much stronger incentive is is anything
that

2896
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:11,520
that
 

2897
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,750
that
allows you to help yourself yes so what

2898
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:13,760
allows you to help yourself yes so what
 

2899
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,870
allows you to help yourself yes so what
i'm saying is that

2900
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:14,880
i'm saying is that
 

2901
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,030
i'm saying is that
uh let's just say free market capitalism

2902
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:17,040
uh let's just say free market capitalism
 

2903
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,150
uh let's just say free market capitalism
was not

2904
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:18,160
was not
 

2905
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,589
was not
based on altruism i think it's based on

2906
00:46:21,589 --> 00:46:21,599
based on altruism i think it's based on
 

2907
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,349
based on altruism i think it's based on
if you make a system of incentives so

2908
00:46:23,349 --> 00:46:23,359
if you make a system of incentives so
 

2909
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:25,430
if you make a system of incentives so
that everybody trying to maximize their

2910
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:25,440
that everybody trying to maximize their
 

2911
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,870
that everybody trying to maximize their
own situation

2912
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:26,880
own situation
 

2913
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,870
own situation
somehow contributes to the whole that's

2914
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:28,880
somehow contributes to the whole that's
 

2915
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,790
somehow contributes to the whole that's
a game's theoretic solution to a very

2916
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:30,800
a game's theoretic solution to a very
 

2917
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,670
a game's theoretic solution to a very
hard problem

2918
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:31,680
hard problem
 

2919
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,950
hard problem
and so this is actually basically

2920
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:32,960
and so this is actually basically
 

2921
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,109
and so this is actually basically
mechanism design we've basically come up

2922
00:46:35,109 --> 00:46:35,119
mechanism design we've basically come up
 

2923
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,550
mechanism design we've basically come up
with a different mechanism

2924
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:36,560
with a different mechanism
 

2925
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,430
with a different mechanism
different set of incentives which

2926
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:39,440
different set of incentives which
 

2927
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,109
different set of incentives which
incentivizes the adoption because

2928
00:46:41,109 --> 00:46:41,119
incentivizes the adoption because
 

2929
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,470
incentivizes the adoption because
actually whenever we've been rolling it

2930
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:42,480
actually whenever we've been rolling it
 

2931
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,030
actually whenever we've been rolling it
out

2932
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:43,040
out
 

2933
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,109
out
usually the first question we ask people

2934
00:46:45,109 --> 00:46:45,119
usually the first question we ask people
 

2935
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:46,630
usually the first question we ask people
like say in the university is

2936
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:46,640
like say in the university is
 

2937
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,790
like say in the university is
do you know what nova does and most of

2938
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:48,800
do you know what nova does and most of
 

2939
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,550
do you know what nova does and most of
them have read about the other apps and

2940
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:50,560
them have read about the other apps and
 

2941
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,990
them have read about the other apps and
they say oh no of it will tell you after

2942
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:52,000
they say oh no of it will tell you after
 

2943
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,270
they say oh no of it will tell you after
you've been around someone so you can

2944
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:53,280
you've been around someone so you can
 

2945
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:53,910
you've been around someone so you can
quarantine

2946
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:53,920
quarantine
 

2947
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,589
quarantine
and we have to explain to them actually

2948
00:46:55,589 --> 00:46:55,599
and we have to explain to them actually
 

2949
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,270
and we have to explain to them actually
novad never wants to ask you to

2950
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:57,280
novad never wants to ask you to
 

2951
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,069
novad never wants to ask you to
quarantine

2952
00:46:58,069 --> 00:46:58,079
quarantine
 

2953
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:59,270
quarantine
yeah that's not the principle our

2954
00:46:59,270 --> 00:46:59,280
yeah that's not the principle our
 

2955
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,109
yeah that's not the principle our
principle isn't based on that at all

2956
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:01,119
principle isn't based on that at all
 

2957
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,630
principle isn't based on that at all
we just want to let you know if

2958
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:02,640
we just want to let you know if
 

2959
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,390
we just want to let you know if
something is coming close

2960
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:04,400
something is coming close
 

2961
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,510
something is coming close
so that you can protect yourself if you

2962
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:07,520
so that you can protect yourself if you
 

2963
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,190
so that you can protect yourself if you
want yeah if you want if you want

2964
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:09,200
want yeah if you want if you want
 

2965
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,190
want yeah if you want if you want
and then the the quarantine is like yes

2966
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:11,200
and then the the quarantine is like yes
 

2967
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,349
and then the the quarantine is like yes
in that case if you're quarantining

2968
00:47:13,349 --> 00:47:13,359
in that case if you're quarantining
 

2969
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,190
in that case if you're quarantining
it's because you're shutting the door

2970
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:15,200
it's because you're shutting the door
 

2971
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,109
it's because you're shutting the door
from the inside if that's exciting yes

2972
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:17,119
from the inside if that's exciting yes
 

2973
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,829
from the inside if that's exciting yes
exactly exactly i mean this is brilliant

2974
00:47:19,829 --> 00:47:19,839
exactly exactly i mean this is brilliant
 

2975
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:20,390
exactly exactly i mean this is brilliant
but so

2976
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:20,400
but so
 

2977
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,030
but so
what um do you think the future looks

2978
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:23,040
what um do you think the future looks
 

2979
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,950
what um do you think the future looks
like for future pandemics what's your

2980
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:24,960
like for future pandemics what's your
 

2981
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:25,750
like for future pandemics what's your
plan

2982
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:25,760
plan
 

2983
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,430
plan
with novid what's your plan with these

2984
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:27,440
with novid what's your plan with these
 

2985
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,950
with novid what's your plan with these
set of ideas i

2986
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:28,960
set of ideas i
 

2987
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,549
set of ideas i
am actually still an academic and a

2988
00:47:30,549 --> 00:47:30,559
am actually still an academic and a
 

2989
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,230
am actually still an academic and a
researcher so the biggest work i'm

2990
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:32,240
researcher so the biggest work i'm
 

2991
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,349
researcher so the biggest work i'm
working on right now

2992
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:33,359
working on right now
 

2993
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:34,710
working on right now
is to try to build as many

2994
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:34,720
is to try to build as many
 

2995
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,710
is to try to build as many
collaborations with other public health

2996
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:36,720
collaborations with other public health
 

2997
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,589
collaborations with other public health
researchers

2998
00:47:37,589 --> 00:47:37,599
researchers
 

2999
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:40,230
researchers
at other universities to actually work

3000
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:40,240
at other universities to actually work
 

3001
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:40,630
at other universities to actually work
on

3002
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:40,640
on
 

3003
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,630
on
pilot deployments together in various

3004
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:42,640
pilot deployments together in various
 

3005
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,990
pilot deployments together in various
places that's the goal

3006
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:44,000
places that's the goal
 

3007
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,910
places that's the goal
that's actually ongoing work right now

3008
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:45,920
that's actually ongoing work right now
 

3009
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,510
that's actually ongoing work right now
and so for example if anyone's watching

3010
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:47,520
and so for example if anyone's watching
 

3011
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,710
and so for example if anyone's watching
this and you happen to be a public

3012
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:48,720
this and you happen to be a public
 

3013
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:49,670
this and you happen to be a public
health researcher

3014
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:49,680
health researcher
 

3015
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,510
health researcher
and you want to be involved in something

3016
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:51,520
and you want to be involved in something
 

3017
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,190
and you want to be involved in something
like this i'm just going to say i'm

3018
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:53,200
like this i'm just going to say i'm
 

3019
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,190
like this i'm just going to say i'm
still incentive thinking

3020
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:55,200
still incentive thinking
 

3021
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,309
still incentive thinking
there's something in it for the

3022
00:47:56,309 --> 00:47:56,319
there's something in it for the
 

3023
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,470
there's something in it for the
researchers too this could open up an

3024
00:47:58,470 --> 00:47:58,480
researchers too this could open up an
 

3025
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,309
researchers too this could open up an
entire new way of controlling disease

3026
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:00,319
entire new way of controlling disease
 

3027
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:01,829
entire new way of controlling disease
that's my hope

3028
00:48:01,829 --> 00:48:01,839
that's my hope
 

3029
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:04,230
that's my hope
i mean it might actually be true and

3030
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:04,240
i mean it might actually be true and
 

3031
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,510
i mean it might actually be true and
people who are involved

3032
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:05,520
people who are involved
 

3033
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,910
people who are involved
in figuring out how to make this work

3034
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:07,920
in figuring out how to make this work
 

3035
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,190
in figuring out how to make this work
well it could actually be good for their

3036
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:09,200
well it could actually be good for their
 

3037
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:09,910
well it could actually be good for their
careers too

3038
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:09,920
careers too
 

3039
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,270
careers too
i i always have to think like if a

3040
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:11,280
i i always have to think like if a
 

3041
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,870
i i always have to think like if a
researcher was getting involved what are

3042
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:12,880
researcher was getting involved what are
 

3043
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,150
researcher was getting involved what are
they getting out of it

3044
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:14,160
they getting out of it
 

3045
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,910
they getting out of it
oh so you mean like uh from a research

3046
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:15,920
oh so you mean like uh from a research
 

3047
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,750
oh so you mean like uh from a research
perspective you can um

3048
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:17,760
perspective you can um
 

3049
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,030
perspective you can um
like publications and sets of ideas

3050
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:21,040
like publications and sets of ideas
 

3051
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,549
like publications and sets of ideas
about how to from a sort of uh

3052
00:48:24,549 --> 00:48:24,559
about how to from a sort of uh
 

3053
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:27,670
about how to from a sort of uh
uh network theory perspective understand

3054
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:27,680
uh network theory perspective understand
 

3055
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,069
uh network theory perspective understand
how we control the spread of a pandemic

3056
00:48:30,069 --> 00:48:30,079
how we control the spread of a pandemic
 

3057
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:30,710
how we control the spread of a pandemic
yes and

3058
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:30,720
yes and
 

3059
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,069
yes and
what i'm doing right now is this is

3060
00:48:32,069 --> 00:48:32,079
what i'm doing right now is this is
 

3061
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,670
what i'm doing right now is this is
basically interdisciplinary research

3062
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:33,680
basically interdisciplinary research
 

3063
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,349
basically interdisciplinary research
where maybe our side is bringing the

3064
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:35,359
where maybe our side is bringing the
 

3065
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:37,030
where maybe our side is bringing the
technology and the network theory

3066
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:37,040
technology and the network theory
 

3067
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,190
technology and the network theory
and the missing parts are epidemiology

3068
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:39,200
and the missing parts are epidemiology
 

3069
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,870
and the missing parts are epidemiology
and public health expertise

3070
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:40,880
and public health expertise
 

3071
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,109
and public health expertise
and if the two things start to join also

3072
00:48:43,109 --> 00:48:43,119
and if the two things start to join also
 

3073
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,270
and if the two things start to join also
because everywhere that you deploy

3074
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:45,280
because everywhere that you deploy
 

3075
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,390
because everywhere that you deploy
let's just say that the world is

3076
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:46,400
let's just say that the world is
 

3077
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,230
let's just say that the world is
different in the philippines as it is in

3078
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:48,240
different in the philippines as it is in
 

3079
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,349
different in the philippines as it is in
the united states

3080
00:48:49,349 --> 00:48:49,359
the united states
 

3081
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,190
the united states
and just the natures of the of the

3082
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:51,200
and just the natures of the of the
 

3083
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,950
and just the natures of the of the
locality would mean that

3084
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:52,960
locality would mean that
 

3085
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,309
locality would mean that
someone like me should not be trying to

3086
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:54,319
someone like me should not be trying to
 

3087
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:55,750
someone like me should not be trying to
figure out how to do that but if we can

3088
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:55,760
figure out how to do that but if we can
 

3089
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,270
figure out how to do that but if we can
work with the researchers who are based

3090
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:57,280
work with the researchers who are based
 

3091
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:57,750
work with the researchers who are based
there

3092
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:57,760
there
 

3093
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,270
there
now suddenly we might come up with a

3094
00:48:59,270 --> 00:48:59,280
now suddenly we might come up with a
 

3095
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,190
now suddenly we might come up with a
solution that will help scale in parts

3096
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:01,200
solution that will help scale in parts
 

3097
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,790
solution that will help scale in parts
of the world where they aren't all

3098
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:02,800
of the world where they aren't all
 

3099
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,630
of the world where they aren't all
getting the modern and fizer vaccines

3100
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:04,640
getting the modern and fizer vaccines
 

3101
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,510
getting the modern and fizer vaccines
which cost

3102
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:05,520
which cost
 

3103

out form
 

3117
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,030
out form
and actually we are i mean again this is

3118
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:19,040
and actually we are i mean again this is
 

3119
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,950
and actually we are i mean again this is
the dna of being a researcher

3120
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:20,960
the dna of being a researcher
 

3121
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,270
the dna of being a researcher
i am actually very excited by the idea

3122
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:23,280
i am actually very excited by the idea
 

3123
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,230
i am actually very excited by the idea
that this could

3124
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:24,240
that this could
 

3125
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,950
that this could
contribute knowledge that will outlast

3126
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:26,960
contribute knowledge that will outlast
 

3127
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,470
contribute knowledge that will outlast
all of our generations like

3128
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:28,480
all of our generations like
 

3129
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,870
all of our generations like
all of our lifetimes there you go reach

3130
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:30,880
all of our lifetimes there you go reach
 

3131
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:31,670
all of our lifetimes there you go reach

people
 

3137
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,430
people
should they install the app and try it

3138
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:37,440
should they install the app and try it
 

3139
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,270
should they install the app and try it
out or is this really geographically

00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:41,680
oh yeah i didn't come on here to tell
 

3145
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,109
oh yeah i didn't come on here to tell
everyone to install the app i did not

because it works best

3150
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:46,400
because it works best
 

3151
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,390
because it works best
if your local health authority is

3152
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:48,400
if your local health authority is
 

3153
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,630
if your local health authority is
working with us gotcha there's a reason

3154
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:50,640
working with us gotcha there's a reason
 

3155
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,870
working with us gotcha there's a reason
it's because this is back to the game

3156
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:52,880
it's because this is back to the game
 

3157
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,630
it's because this is back to the game
theory

3158
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:54,640
theory
 

3159
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,309
theory
if anyone could just say i'm positive

3160
00:49:58,309 --> 00:49:58,319
if anyone could just say i'm positive
 

3161
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:01,190
if anyone could just say i'm positive
the high school senior prank would be to

3162
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:01,200
the high school senior prank would be to
 

3163
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:01,750
the high school senior prank would be to
say that

3164
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:01,760
say that
 

3165
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,270
say that
we have a massive outbreak on finals

3166
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:03,280
we have a massive outbreak on finals
 

3167
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,109
we have a massive outbreak on finals
week let's not have final exams

3168
00:50:05,109 --> 00:50:05,119
week let's not have final exams
 

3169
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:06,710
week let's not have final exams
so the way that our system works it

3170
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:06,720
so the way that our system works it
 

3171
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,870
so the way that our system works it
actually borrows some ideas no borrowers

3172
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:08,880
actually borrows some ideas no borrowers
 

3173
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,309
actually borrows some ideas no borrowers
we came up with them independently but

3174
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:10,319
we came up with them independently but
 

3175
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:11,990
we came up with them independently but
this idea is similar to what

3176
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:12,000
this idea is similar to what
 

3177
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,829
this idea is similar to what
google and apple do which is that if the

3178
00:50:13,829 --> 00:50:13,839
google and apple do which is that if the
 

3179
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,430
google and apple do which is that if the
local health authority is working with

3180
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:15,440
local health authority is working with
 

3181
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,069
local health authority is working with
this

3182
00:50:16,069 --> 00:50:16,079
this
 

3183
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:17,829
this
they can for everyone who's positive

3184
00:50:17,829 --> 00:50:17,839
they can for everyone who's positive
 

3185
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:19,589
they can for everyone who's positive
gives them a passcode that expires in a

3186
00:50:19,589 --> 00:50:19,599
gives them a passcode that expires in a
 

3187
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:20,549
gives them a passcode that expires in a
short time

3188
00:50:20,549 --> 00:50:20,559
short time
 

3189
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,069
short time
so for ours if you're on the app and

3190
00:50:22,069 --> 00:50:22,079
so for ours if you're on the app and
 

3191
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,309
so for ours if you're on the app and
saying i'm positive you can either just

3192
00:50:24,309 --> 00:50:24,319
saying i'm positive you can either just
 

3193
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:24,950
saying i'm positive you can either just
say that

3194
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:24,960
say that
 

3195
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,109
say that
and that's called unverified or you can

3196
00:50:27,109 --> 00:50:27,119
and that's called unverified or you can
 

3197
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:28,630
and that's called unverified or you can
enter in one of these codes that you got

3198
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:28,640
enter in one of these codes that you got
 

3199
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,230
enter in one of these codes that you got
from the local health authority

3200
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:30,240
from the local health authority
 

3201
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,069
from the local health authority
so basically for anyone who's watching

3202
00:50:32,069 --> 00:50:32,079
so basically for anyone who's watching
 

3203
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:33,349
so basically for anyone who's watching
this it's not that you should just go

3204
00:50:33,349 --> 00:50:33,359
this it's not that you should just go
 

3205
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:34,549
this it's not that you should just go
and download it unless you want to go

3206
00:50:34,549 --> 00:50:34,559
and download it unless you want to go
 

3207
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:36,069
and download it unless you want to go
and look at it that's cool

3208
00:50:36,069 --> 00:50:36,079
and look at it that's cool
 

3209
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:37,589
and look at it that's cool
but if you on the other hand if you

3210
00:50:37,589 --> 00:50:37,599
but if you on the other hand if you
 

3211
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:39,190
but if you on the other hand if you
happen to know anyone at the local

3212
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:39,200
happen to know anyone at the local
 

3213
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:39,990
happen to know anyone at the local
health authority which

3214
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:40,000
health authority which
 

3215
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,670
health authority which
is trying to figure out how to handle

3216
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:41,680
is trying to figure out how to handle
 

3217
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,109
is trying to figure out how to handle
kovid well then

3218
00:50:43,109 --> 00:50:43,119
kovid well then
 

3219
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:44,950
kovid well then
i mean we'd be very happy to also work

3220
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:44,960
i mean we'd be very happy to also work
 

3221
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,309
i mean we'd be very happy to also work
with you

3222
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:46,319
with you
 

3223
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,390
with you
guys so the the verified there is really

3224
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:48,400
guys so the the verified there is really
 

3225
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,670
guys so the the verified there is really
important because you're

3226
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:49,680
important because you're
 

3227
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,670
important because you're
you're maintaining anonymity and because

3228
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:51,680
you're maintaining anonymity and because
 

3229
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,270
you're maintaining anonymity and because
of that you have to have some source of

3230
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:53,280
of that you have to have some source of
 

3231
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,470
of that you have to have some source of
verification

3232
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:54,480
verification
 

3233
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,109
verification
in order to make sure that it's not uh

3234
00:50:57,109 --> 00:50:57,119
in order to make sure that it's not uh
 

3235
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:58,950
in order to make sure that it's not uh
possible to manipulate

3236
00:50:58,950 --> 00:50:58,960
possible to manipulate
 

3237
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,710
possible to manipulate
because uh it's it's ultimately about

3238
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:00,720
because uh it's it's ultimately about
 

3239
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,750
because uh it's it's ultimately about
trust and information and so it could be

3240
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:03,760
trust and information and so it could be
 

3241
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,829
trust and information and so it could be
um verification is really important

3242
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:05,839
um verification is really important
 

3243
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:07,349
um verification is really important
there so basically individual people

3244
00:51:07,349 --> 00:51:07,359
there so basically individual people
 

3245
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:09,349
there so basically individual people
should um

3246
00:51:09,349 --> 00:51:09,359
should um
 

3247
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,750
should um
ask their local health authorities to to

3248
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:11,760
ask their local health authorities to to

00:51:28,549 --> 00:51:28,559
response to the virus
 

3265
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,950
response to the virus
economically speaking the number of

3266
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:30,960
economically speaking the number of
 

3267
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,470
economically speaking the number of
people who lost their dream

3268
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:32,480
people who lost their dream
 

3269
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,630
people who lost their dream
lost their jobs but also lost their

3270
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:34,640
lost their jobs but also lost their
 

3271
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,549
lost their jobs but also lost their
dream entrepreneurs

3272
00:51:36,549 --> 00:51:36,559
dream entrepreneurs
 

3273
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,549
dream entrepreneurs
you know jobs often give meaning there's

3274
00:51:38,549 --> 00:51:38,559
you know jobs often give meaning there's
 

3275
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:40,069
you know jobs often give meaning there's
people who financially and

3276
00:51:40,069 --> 00:51:40,079
people who financially and
 

3277
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:42,150
people who financially and
psychologically are suffering because of

00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:42,160
psychologically are suffering because of
 

3279
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,589
psychologically are suffering because of
our

3280

our
 

3281
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,910
our
i'll say incompetent response to the

00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:45,920
i'll say incompetent response to the
 

3283
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,270
i'll say incompetent response to the
virus

3284

virus
 

3285
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,190

states that should be the beacon

3288
00:51:52,069 --> 00:51:52,079
states that should be the beacon
 

3289
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,230
states that should be the beacon
of uh entrepreneurial hope for the world

3290
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:54,240
of uh entrepreneurial hope for the world
 

3291
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,510
of uh entrepreneurial hope for the world
so

3292
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:55,520
so
 

3293
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,710
so
i i hope that uh

3294
00:51:58,710 --> 00:51:58,720
i i hope that uh
 

3295
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,109
i i hope that uh
we'll be able to respond to these kinds

3296
00:52:01,109 --> 00:52:01,119
we'll be able to respond to these kinds
 

3297
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:02,630
we'll be able to respond to these kinds
of events much better in the future and

3298
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:02,640
of events much better in the future and
 

3299
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,870
of events much better in the future and
this is exactly the right kind of idea

3300
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:04,880
this is exactly the right kind of idea
 

3301
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,150
this is exactly the right kind of idea
and now is the time to do the investment

3302
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:08,160
and now is the time to do the investment
 

3303
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,349
and now is the time to do the investment
let's step back to the beauty of of uh

3304
00:52:11,349 --> 00:52:11,359
let's step back to the beauty of of uh
 

3305
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:12,870
let's step back to the beauty of of uh
mathematics

3306
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:12,880
mathematics
 

3307
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,589
mathematics
maybe ask the the big silly question

3308
00:52:15,589 --> 00:52:15,599
maybe ask the the big silly question
 

3309
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,430
maybe ask the the big silly question
first which is uh

3310
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:17,440
first which is uh
 

3311
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,790
first which is uh
what do you find beautiful about

3312
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:18,800
what do you find beautiful about
 

3313
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,710
what do you find beautiful about
mathematics

3314
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:20,720
mathematics
 

3315
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,870
mathematics
i think that being able to look at a

3316
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:24,880
i think that being able to look at a
 

3317
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,349
i think that being able to look at a
complicated problem which looks

3318
00:52:27,349 --> 00:52:27,359
complicated problem which looks
 

3319
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:28,470
complicated problem which looks
unsolvable

3320
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:28,480
unsolvable
 

3321
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,990
unsolvable
and then to be able to change the

3322
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:30,000
and then to be able to change the
 

3323
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,589
and then to be able to change the
perspective to come from a different

3324
00:52:31,589 --> 00:52:31,599
perspective to come from a different
 

3325
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:32,309
perspective to come from a different
angle

3326
00:52:32,309 --> 00:52:32,319
angle
 

3327
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,549
angle
and suddenly see that there's a nice

3328
00:52:34,549 --> 00:52:34,559
and suddenly see that there's a nice
 

3329
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:35,990
and suddenly see that there's a nice
solution

3330
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:36,000
solution
 

3331
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,750
solution
i don't mean that every problem in math

3332
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:37,760
i don't mean that every problem in math
 

3333
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,430
i don't mean that every problem in math
is supposed to be this way but i think

3334
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:39,440
is supposed to be this way but i think
 

3335
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,069
is supposed to be this way but i think
that these

3336
00:52:40,069 --> 00:52:40,079
that these
 

3337
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:41,990
that these
reframings and changing of perspectives

3338
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:42,000
reframings and changing of perspectives
 

3339
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,910
reframings and changing of perspectives
that cause difficult things to get

3340
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:43,920
that cause difficult things to get
 

3341
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,510
that cause difficult things to get
simplified and crystallize

3342
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:45,520
simplified and crystallize
 

3343
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,510
simplified and crystallize
and factored in certain ways is

3344
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:47,520
and factored in certain ways is
 

3345
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,270
and factored in certain ways is
beautiful actually that's

3346
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:49,280
beautiful actually that's
 

3347
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,549
beautiful actually that's
related to what we were just talking

3348
00:52:50,549 --> 00:52:50,559
related to what we were just talking
 

3349
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,470
related to what we were just talking
about with even this fighting pandemics

3350
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:52,480
about with even this fighting pandemics
 

3351
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,750
about with even this fighting pandemics
the the crystal idea was just

3352
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:55,760
the the crystal idea was just
 

3353
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,710
the the crystal idea was just
quantify proximity by the number of

3354
00:52:58,710 --> 00:52:58,720
quantify proximity by the number of
 

3355
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,069
quantify proximity by the number of
relationships in the phys

3356
00:53:00,069 --> 00:53:00,079
relationships in the phys
 

3357
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,309
relationships in the phys
in the physical network instead of just

3358
00:53:02,309 --> 00:53:02,319
in the physical network instead of just
 

3359
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:04,470
in the physical network instead of just
by the feet and meters

3360
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:04,480
by the feet and meters
 

3361
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,470
by the feet and meters
right it's it's just if you change that

3362
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:06,480
right it's it's just if you change that
 

3363
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,309
right it's it's just if you change that
perspective now all of these things

3364
00:53:08,309 --> 00:53:08,319
perspective now all of these things
 

3365
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:09,109
perspective now all of these things
follow

3366
00:53:09,109 --> 00:53:09,119
follow
 

3367
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,230
follow
and so mathematics to me is beautiful

3368
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:12,240
and so mathematics to me is beautiful
 

3369
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,349
and so mathematics to me is beautiful
in the pure sense just for that yeah

3370
00:53:15,349 --> 00:53:15,359
in the pure sense just for that yeah
 

3371
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:16,710
in the pure sense just for that yeah
it's quite interesting to see a human

3372
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:16,720
it's quite interesting to see a human
 

3373
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,990
it's quite interesting to see a human
civilization as a network as a graph

3374
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:20,000
civilization as a network as a graph
 

3375
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,030
civilization as a network as a graph
and our relationships as kind of

3376
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:23,040
and our relationships as kind of
 

3377
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,710
and our relationships as kind of
edges in that graph and to then

3378
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:26,720
edges in that graph and to then
 

3379
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,589
edges in that graph and to then
do outside of just pandemic do

3380
00:53:29,589 --> 00:53:29,599
do outside of just pandemic do
 

3381
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:30,870
do outside of just pandemic do
interesting inferences

3382
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:30,880
interesting inferences
 

3383
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,870
interesting inferences
based on that this this is true for like

3384
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:34,880
based on that this this is true for like
 

3385
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,870
based on that this this is true for like
twitter social networks and so on

3386
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:36,880
twitter social networks and so on
 

3387
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,190
twitter social networks and so on
how we expand the kind of things we talk

3388
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:39,200
how we expand the kind of things we talk
 

3389
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,069
how we expand the kind of things we talk
about

3390
00:53:40,069 --> 00:53:40,079
about
 

3391
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:42,309
about
think about sort of politically if you

3392
00:53:42,309 --> 00:53:42,319
think about sort of politically if you
 

3393
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:43,829
think about sort of politically if you
have this little bubble

3394
00:53:43,829 --> 00:53:43,839
have this little bubble
 

3395
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:45,910
have this little bubble
quote-unquote of ideas that you play

3396
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:45,920
quote-unquote of ideas that you play

it's uh nice from a recommender system

3400
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:49,520
it's uh nice from a recommender system
 

3401
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,190
it's uh nice from a recommender system
perspective how do you jump out of those

3402
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:51,200
perspective how do you jump out of those
 

3403
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:51,829
perspective how do you jump out of those
bubbles

3404
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:51,839
bubbles
 

3405
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:54,069
bubbles
it's really fascinating uh youtube was

3406
00:53:54,069 --> 00:53:54,079
it's really fascinating uh youtube was
 

3407
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:55,829
it's really fascinating uh youtube was
working on that

3408
00:53:55,829 --> 00:53:55,839
working on that
 

3409
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:58,870
working on that
twitter's working on that but not always

3410
00:53:58,870 --> 00:53:58,880
twitter's working on that but not always
 

3411
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,230
twitter's working on that but not always
so successfully but

3412
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:00,240
so successfully but
 

3413
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,950
so successfully but
there's a lot of interesting work from a

3414
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:02,960
there's a lot of interesting work from a
 

3415
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:03,829
there's a lot of interesting work from a

perspective there in
within those graphs but if we look at

00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:10,800
within those graphs but if we look at
 

3423
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,950
within those graphs but if we look at
the cleanest formulation of that

3424

the cleanest formulation of that
 

3425

00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,589
perspective
you're also involved with the

3430
00:54:17,589 --> 00:54:17,599
you're also involved with the
 

3431
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,150
you're also involved with the
international mathematics olympiad

3432
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:20,160
international mathematics olympiad
 

3433
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:24,710
international mathematics olympiad
which takes a small clean

3434
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:24,720
which takes a small clean
 

3435
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,670
which takes a small clean
uh problems that are really hard but

3436
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:27,680
uh problems that are really hard but
 

3437
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,589
uh problems that are really hard but
once you look at them differently

3438
00:54:29,589 --> 00:54:29,599
once you look at them differently
 

3439
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,790
once you look at them differently
can become easy but that little jump of

3440
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:32,800
can become easy but that little jump of
 

3441
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,309
can become easy but that little jump of
innovation is is uh is the entire trick

3442
00:54:36,309 --> 00:54:36,319
innovation is is uh is the entire trick
 

3443
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:38,870
innovation is is uh is the entire trick
so maybe at the high level can you say

3444
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:38,880
so maybe at the high level can you say
 

3445
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,549
so maybe at the high level can you say
what is the international mathematical

3446
00:54:40,549 --> 00:54:40,559
what is the international mathematical
 

3447
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:41,510
what is the international mathematical
olympiad

3448
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:41,520
olympiad
 

3449
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,549
olympiad
sure so this is uh the competition

3450
00:54:44,549 --> 00:54:44,559
sure so this is uh the competition
 

3451
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:46,950
sure so this is uh the competition
for people who aren't yet in college uh

3452
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:46,960
for people who aren't yet in college uh
 

3453
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,470
for people who aren't yet in college uh
math competition which is

3454
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:48,480
math competition which is
 

3455
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,150
math competition which is
the most prestigious one in the entire

3456
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:50,160
the most prestigious one in the entire
 

3457
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,710
the most prestigious one in the entire
world it's the olympics of mathematics

3458
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:52,720
world it's the olympics of mathematics
 

3459
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,069
world it's the olympics of mathematics
but only for people who aren't yet in

3460
00:54:54,069 --> 00:54:54,079
but only for people who aren't yet in
 

3461
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:56,549
but only for people who aren't yet in
college now the kinds of questions that

3462
00:54:56,549 --> 00:54:56,559
college now the kinds of questions that
 

3463
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:57,910
college now the kinds of questions that
they ask you to do

3464
00:54:57,910 --> 00:54:57,920
they ask you to do
 

3465
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,150
they ask you to do
are not computational usually you're not

3466
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:00,160
are not computational usually you're not
 

3467
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,190
are not computational usually you're not
supposed to find that the answer is 42

3468
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:03,200
supposed to find that the answer is 42
 

3469
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,510
supposed to find that the answer is 42
right instead you're supposed to explain

3470
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:05,520
right instead you're supposed to explain
 

3471
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,789
right instead you're supposed to explain
why something is true

3472
00:55:06,789 --> 00:55:06,799
why something is true
 

3473
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:09,349
why something is true
yes and the the problem is that at the

3474
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:09,359
yes and the the problem is that at the
 

3475
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:10,710
yes and the the problem is that at the
beginning when you look at each of the

3476
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:10,720
beginning when you look at each of the
 

3477
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:11,430
beginning when you look at each of the
questions

3478
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:11,440
questions
 

3479
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,030
questions
first of all you have four and a half

3480
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:13,040
first of all you have four and a half
 

3481
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,030
first of all you have four and a half
hours to solve three questions

3482
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:15,040
hours to solve three questions
 

3483
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,470
hours to solve three questions
and this is one day and then you have a

3484
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:16,480
and this is one day and then you have a
 

3485
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,589
and this is one day and then you have a
second day which is four and a half

3486
00:55:17,589 --> 00:55:17,599
second day which is four and a half
 

3487
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:18,309
second day which is four and a half
hours

3488
00:55:18,309 --> 00:55:18,319
hours
 

3489
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:19,990
hours
three questions but when you look at the

3490
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:20,000
three questions but when you look at the
 

3491
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,829
three questions but when you look at the
questions they're all asking you explain

3492
00:55:21,829 --> 00:55:21,839
questions they're all asking you explain
 

3493
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:23,349
questions they're all asking you explain
why the following thing is true which

3494
00:55:23,349 --> 00:55:23,359
why the following thing is true which
 

3495
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:25,109
why the following thing is true which
you've never seen before

3496
00:55:25,109 --> 00:55:25,119
you've never seen before
 

3497
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:26,950
you've never seen before
and by the way even though there are six

3498
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:26,960
and by the way even though there are six
 

3499
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,309
and by the way even though there are six
questions if you solve any one of them

3500
00:55:28,309 --> 00:55:28,319
questions if you solve any one of them
 

3501
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:29,910
questions if you solve any one of them
you're a genius and you get an honorable

3502
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:29,920
you're a genius and you get an honorable
 

3503
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,030
you're a genius and you get an honorable
mention so this is

3504
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:31,040
mention so this is
 

3505
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,109
mention so this is
this is hard to explain a hard problem

3506
00:55:33,109 --> 00:55:33,119
this is hard to explain a hard problem
 

3507
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,270
this is hard to explain a hard problem
what about is it one person is it a team

3508
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:35,280
what about is it one person is it a team
 

3509
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,910
what about is it one person is it a team
ah so it's each country can send six

3510
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:37,920
ah so it's each country can send six
 

3511
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:38,710
ah so it's each country can send six
people

3512
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:38,720
people
 

3513
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,589
people
and the score of the country is actually

3514
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:41,599
and the score of the country is actually
 

3515
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,190
and the score of the country is actually
unofficial there's not an official

3516
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:43,200
unofficial there's not an official
 

3517
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:43,750
unofficial there's not an official
country

3518
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:43,760
country
 

3519
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,069
country
versus country system although everyone

3520
00:55:46,069 --> 00:55:46,079
versus country system although everyone
 

3521
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:47,829
versus country system although everyone
just adds up the point scores of the six

3522
00:55:47,829 --> 00:55:47,839
just adds up the point scores of the six
 

3523
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:48,230
just adds up the point scores of the six
people

3524
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:48,240
people
 

3525
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,910
people
and they say well now which country uh

3526
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:49,920
and they say well now which country uh
 

3527
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,349
and they say well now which country uh
stacked up where

3528
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:51,359
stacked up where
 

3529
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:53,589
stacked up where
yeah so maybe as a side comment i should

3530
00:55:53,589 --> 00:55:53,599
yeah so maybe as a side comment i should
 

3531
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,430
yeah so maybe as a side comment i should
say that um

3532
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:55,440
say that um
 

3533
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,870
say that um
there's a bunch of countries including

3534
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:56,880
there's a bunch of countries including
 

3535
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,510
there's a bunch of countries including
the former soviet union and russia

3536
00:55:59,510 --> 00:55:59,520
the former soviet union and russia
 

3537
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,870
the former soviet union and russia
uh where i grew up where this is one of

3538
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:02,880
uh where i grew up where this is one of
 

3539
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,309
uh where i grew up where this is one of
the

3540
00:56:04,309 --> 00:56:04,319
the
 

3541
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,789
the
most important competitions that the

3542
00:56:06,789 --> 00:56:06,799
most important competitions that the
 

3543
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:08,309
most important competitions that the
country participates in like

3544
00:56:08,309 --> 00:56:08,319
country participates in like
 

3545
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:11,030
country participates in like
it was a source of pride for a lot of

3546
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:11,040
it was a source of pride for a lot of
 

3547
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,069
it was a source of pride for a lot of
the country

3548
00:56:12,069 --> 00:56:12,079
the country
 

3549
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:15,510
the country
you look at the olympic sports like uh

3550
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:15,520
you look at the olympic sports like uh
 

3551
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,510
you look at the olympic sports like uh
wrestling weightlifting there's certain

3552
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:17,520

and hockey that russia
 

3557
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,950
and hockey that russia
and the soviet union truly took pride in

3558
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:24,960
and the soviet union truly took pride in
 

3559
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,309
and the soviet union truly took pride in
and actually the

3560
00:56:26,309 --> 00:56:26,319
and actually the
 

3561
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:29,430
and actually the
mathematical olympiad it was one of them

3562
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:29,440
mathematical olympiad it was one of them
 

3563
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:29,990
mathematical olympiad it was one of them
for many

3564
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:30,000
for many
 

3565
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,950
for many
years it's still one of them and that's

3566
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:32,960
years it's still one of them and that's
 

3567
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,150
years it's still one of them and that's
kind of fascinating we don't

3568
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:34,160
kind of fascinating we don't
 

3569
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,069
kind of fascinating we don't
think about it this way in the united

3570
00:56:36,069 --> 00:56:36,079
think about it this way in the united
 

3571
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:37,910
think about it this way in the united
states maybe you can correct me if i'm

3572
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:37,920
states maybe you can correct me if i'm
 

3573
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:38,870
states maybe you can correct me if i'm
wrong but

3574
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:38,880
wrong but
 

3575
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,990
wrong but
it's not nearly as popular in the united

3576
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:42,000
it's not nearly as popular in the united
 

3577
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,150
it's not nearly as popular in the united
states in terms of its integration into

3578
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:44,160
states in terms of its integration into
 

3579
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,589
states in terms of its integration into
the culture

3580
00:56:45,589 --> 00:56:45,599
the culture
 

3581
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:48,069
the culture
into uh just basic conversation into the

can walk around proud

3590
00:56:56,069 --> 00:56:56,079
can walk around proud
 

3591
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,190
can walk around proud
i think that was the case with the

3592
00:56:57,190 --> 00:56:57,200
i think that was the case with the
 

3593
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,190
i think that was the case with the
mathematical olympiad in russia

3594
00:56:59,190 --> 00:56:59,200
mathematical olympiad in russia
 

3595
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,990
mathematical olympiad in russia
not not as much the case in the united

3596
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:02,000
not not as much the case in the united
 

3597
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:02,950
not not as much the case in the united
states i think

3598
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:02,960
states i think
 

3599
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,309
states i think
so i just want to give that a little

3600
00:57:04,309 --> 00:57:04,319
so i just want to give that a little
 

3601
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:06,870
so i just want to give that a little
aside because beating anybody

3602
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:06,880
aside because beating anybody
 

3603
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,710
aside because beating anybody
from russia from the eastern republic or

3604
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:08,720
from russia from the eastern republic or
 

3605
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,230
from russia from the eastern republic or
from china is very

3606
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:10,240
from china is very
 

3607
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,710
from china is very
very difficult that like if i remember

3608
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:12,720
very difficult that like if i remember
 

3609
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,470
very difficult that like if i remember
correctly

3610
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:14,480
correctly
 

3611
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,549
correctly
you know there's people this was a

3612
00:57:16,549 --> 00:57:16,559
you know there's people this was a
 

3613
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:17,510
you know there's people this was a
multi-year

3614
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:17,520
multi-year
 

3615
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,630
multi-year
training process they train hard

3616
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:20,640
training process they train hard
 

3617
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,670
training process they train hard
and this is this is everything that

3618
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:23,680
and this is this is everything that
 

3619
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,030
and this is this is everything that
they're focused on

3620
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:25,040
they're focused on
 

3621
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,390
they're focused on
my uh my dad was was uh was a

3622
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:28,400
my uh my dad was was uh was a
 

3623
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,829
my uh my dad was was uh was a
participant in this and

3624
00:57:29,829 --> 00:57:29,839
participant in this and
 

3625
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:32,390
participant in this and
it's i mean it's uh it's as serious as

3626
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:32,400
it's i mean it's uh it's as serious as
 

3627
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,750
it's i mean it's uh it's as serious as
olympic sports you think about like

3628
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:33,760
olympic sports you think about like
 

3629
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,270
olympic sports you think about like
gymnastics like young athletes

3630
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:35,280
gymnastics like young athletes
 

3631
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,549
gymnastics like young athletes
participating gymnastics

3632
00:57:36,549 --> 00:57:36,559
participating gymnastics
 

3633
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:38,470
participating gymnastics
is this as serious as that if not more

3634
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:38,480
is this as serious as that if not more
 

3635
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,309
is this as serious as that if not more
serious so i just want to give that a

3636
00:57:40,309 --> 00:57:40,319
serious so i just want to give that a
 

3637
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:41,510
serious so i just want to give that a
little bit of context because we're

3638
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:41,520
little bit of context because we're
 

3639
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,789
little bit of context because we're
talking about serious high level math

3640
00:57:44,789 --> 00:57:44,799
talking about serious high level math
 

3641
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:47,270
talking about serious high level math
athletics almost here yeah and actually

3642
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:47,280
athletics almost here yeah and actually
 

3643
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,789
athletics almost here yeah and actually
i also think that it

3644
00:57:48,789 --> 00:57:48,799
i also think that it
 

3645
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,789
i also think that it
made sense from the soviet union's

3646
00:57:50,789 --> 00:57:50,799
made sense from the soviet union's
 

3647
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:51,910
made sense from the soviet union's
perspective because

3648
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:51,920
perspective because
 

3649
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,990
perspective because
if you look at what these people do

3650
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:54,000
if you look at what these people do
 

3651
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,430
if you look at what these people do
eventually

3652
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:55,440
eventually
 

3653
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,069
eventually
even though let's look at the ussrs or

3654
00:57:58,069 --> 00:57:58,079
even though let's look at the ussrs or
 

3655
00:57:58,079 --> 00:57:58,710
even though let's look at the ussrs or
the

3656
00:57:58,710 --> 00:57:58,720
the
 

3657
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,789
the
international math olympiad record even

3658
00:58:00,789 --> 00:58:00,799
international math olympiad record even
 

3659
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:03,030
international math olympiad record even
though they i say even though they won

3660
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:03,040
though they i say even though they won
 

3661
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,190
though they i say even though they won
a lot of awards at the high school thing

3662
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:05,200
a lot of awards at the high school thing
 

3663
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,190
a lot of awards at the high school thing
many of them went on to do incredible

3664
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:07,200
many of them went on to do incredible
 

3665
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:07,750
many of them went on to do incredible
things

3666
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:07,760
things
 

3667
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,670

other things and
 

3671
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,990
other things and
that's showing the generalization

3672
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:13,000
that's showing the generalization
 

3673
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,230
that's showing the generalization
generalizability

3674
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:14,240
generalizability
 

3675
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,309
generalizability
of what they were working on because

of what they were working on because
 

3677
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,150
of what they were working on because
ultimately

3678
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:18,160
ultimately
 

3679
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,870
ultimately
we're just playing with ideas of how to

3680
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:20,880
we're just playing with ideas of how to
 

3681
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,309
we're just playing with ideas of how to
prove things

3682
00:58:22,309 --> 00:58:22,319
prove things
 

3683
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:25,109
prove things
and if you get pretty good at inventing

3684
00:58:25,109 --> 00:58:25,119
and if you get pretty good at inventing
 

3685
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:26,470
and if you get pretty good at inventing
creative ways to

3686
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:26,480
creative ways to
 

3687
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,950
creative ways to
turn problems apart split them apart

3688
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:28,960
turn problems apart split them apart
 

3689
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:29,750
turn problems apart split them apart
observe

3690
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:29,760
observe
 

3691
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,710
observe
neat ways to turn messy things into

3692
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:32,720
neat ways to turn messy things into
 

3693
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,990
neat ways to turn messy things into
simple crystals

3694
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:34,000
simple crystals
 

3695
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,589
simple crystals
well if you're going to try to solve any

3696
00:58:35,589 --> 00:58:35,599
well if you're going to try to solve any
 

3697
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:37,030
well if you're going to try to solve any
real problem in the real world

3698
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:37,040
real problem in the real world
 

3699
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,270
real problem in the real world
that could be a really handy tool too so

3700
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:39,280
that could be a really handy tool too so
 

3701
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,030
that could be a really handy tool too so
i don't think it was a bad investment

3702
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:41,040
i don't think it was a bad investment
 

3703
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,510
i don't think it was a bad investment
i i think it clearly worked well for

3704
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:43,520
i i think it clearly worked well for
 

3705
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,870
i i think it clearly worked well for
soviet union

3706
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:44,880
soviet union
 

3707
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,270
soviet union
yeah so this this is interesting people

3708
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:47,280
yeah so this this is interesting people
 

3709
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,349
yeah so this this is interesting people
sometimes ask me you know you go up and

3710
00:58:49,349 --> 00:58:49,359
sometimes ask me you know you go up and
 

3711
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:52,309
sometimes ask me you know you go up and
and under communism you know was there

3712
00:58:52,309 --> 00:58:52,319
and under communism you know was there
 

3713
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:55,589
and under communism you know was there
anything good about communism

3714
00:58:55,589 --> 00:58:55,599
anything good about communism
 

3715
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,990
anything good about communism
and it's difficult for me to talk about

3716
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:58,000
and it's difficult for me to talk about
 

3717
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,109
and it's difficult for me to talk about
it because it's not

3718
00:58:59,109 --> 00:58:59,119
it because it's not
 

3719
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:00,710
it because it's not
uh communism is one of those things

3720
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:00,720
uh communism is one of those things
 

3721
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,789
uh communism is one of those things
that's looked down on like without

3722
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:02,799
that's looked down on like without
 

3723
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:05,670
that's looked down on like without
in absolutist terms currently but you

3724
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:05,680
in absolutist terms currently but you
 

3725
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,230
in absolutist terms currently but you
could still

3726
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:06,240
could still
 

3727
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,549
could still
in my perspective talk about the actual

3728
00:59:08,549 --> 00:59:08,559
in my perspective talk about the actual
 

3729
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:11,030
in my perspective talk about the actual
forget communism or whatever the actual

3730
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:11,040
forget communism or whatever the actual
 

3731
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:15,030
forget communism or whatever the actual
term is but you know certain

3732
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:15,040
term is but you know certain
 

3733
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,870
term is but you know certain
ways that the society function that we

3734
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:16,880
ways that the society function that we
 

3735
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,069
ways that the society function that we
can learn lessons from

3736
00:59:18,069 --> 00:59:18,079
can learn lessons from
 

3737
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:19,829
can learn lessons from
and one of the things in the soviet

3738
00:59:19,829 --> 00:59:19,839
and one of the things in the soviet
 

3739
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:22,549
and one of the things in the soviet
union that was highly prized

3740
00:59:22,549 --> 00:59:22,559
union that was highly prized
 

3741
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:26,150
union that was highly prized
is knowledge not even now it's

3742
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:26,160
is knowledge not even now it's
 

3743
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:30,549
is knowledge not even now it's
wisdom and the skill of invention

3744
00:59:30,549 --> 00:59:30,559
wisdom and the skill of invention
 

3745
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:34,069
wisdom and the skill of invention
of innovation at a young age

3746
00:59:34,069 --> 00:59:34,079
of innovation at a young age
 

3747
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:36,710
of innovation at a young age
so we're not talking about a selection

3748
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:36,720
so we're not talking about a selection
 

3749
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,030
so we're not talking about a selection
process where you pick the best students

3750
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:39,040
process where you pick the best students
 

3751
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,150
process where you pick the best students
in the school to do the mathematics

3752
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:42,160

mathematics
is essentially formalized competition of

invention

3848
01:01:17,109 --> 01:01:17,119
invention
 

3849
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:20,710
invention
of uh of creating

3850
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:20,720
of uh of creating
 

3851
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,349
of uh of creating
new ideas and that generalizes really

3852
01:01:23,349 --> 01:01:23,359
new ideas and that generalizes really
 

3853
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:24,470
new ideas and that generalizes really
really well so

3854
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:24,480
really well so
 

3855
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,829
really well so
that's that's quite brilliantly put i

3856
01:01:25,829 --> 01:01:25,839
that's that's quite brilliantly put i
 

3857
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:27,670
that's that's quite brilliantly put i
didn't really think about that so this

3858
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:27,680
didn't really think about that so this
 

3859
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,270
didn't really think about that so this
is not just about the competition this

3860
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:29,280
is not just about the competition this
 

3861
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,309
is not just about the competition this
is about

3862
01:01:30,309 --> 01:01:30,319
is about
 

3863
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:33,349
is about
developing minds that uh

3864
01:01:33,349 --> 01:01:33,359
developing minds that uh
 

3865
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:36,150
developing minds that uh
will come come to do some incredible

3866
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:36,160
will come come to do some incredible
 

3867
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,270
will come come to do some incredible
stuff in the future

couple of things there the first one

3872
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:40,000
couple of things there the first one
 

3873
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:40,549
couple of things there the first one
this one

3874
01:01:40,549 --> 01:01:40,559
this one
 

3875
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:42,470
this one
um which is this notion of whether or

3876
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:42,480
um which is this notion of whether or
 

3877
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,030
um which is this notion of whether or
not that is possible in a

3878
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:44,040
not that is possible in a
 

3879
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,150
not that is possible in a
non-authoritarian regime

3880
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:46,160
non-authoritarian regime
 

3881
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,829
non-authoritarian regime
i think it is and that's actually why i

3882
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:47,839
i think it is and that's actually why i
 

3883
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:49,430
i think it is and that's actually why i
spent some of my efforts

3884
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:49,440
spent some of my efforts
 

3885
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,510
spent some of my efforts
before the covet thing actually trying

3886
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:51,520
before the covet thing actually trying
 

3887
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,750
before the covet thing actually trying
to work towards there the reason is

3888
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:53,760
to work towards there the reason is
 

3889
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:54,390
to work towards there the reason is
because

3890
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:54,400
because
 

3891

and i think it actually should be so

3928
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:28,720
and i think it actually should be so

is what you commented about
this thing about um you know the

3934

this thing about um you know the
 

3935
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,230
this thing about um you know the
generalizable skill and what what could

3936
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:36,240
generalizable skill and what what could
 

3937
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,990
generalizable skill and what what could
people do with olympiads afterwards so

3938
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:38,000
people do with olympiads afterwards so
 

3939
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,349
people do with olympiads afterwards so
that's actually my interest in the whole

3940
01:02:39,349 --> 01:02:39,359
that's actually my interest in the whole

uh i don't i mean i don't
 

3945
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,270
uh i don't i mean i don't
just coach students how to do problems

3946
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:45,280
just coach students how to do problems
 

3947
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,870
just coach students how to do problems
in fact i'm not even the best person for

there are other people who are much
 

3955
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,910
there are other people who are much
better at making problems and teaching

3956
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:51,920
better at making problems and teaching
 

3957

you're going to let me work with
 

3987
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,190

01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:23,920
this
 

3991
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,510
this
system because the coach works with

system because the coach works with
these gets to run a camp for these

students
i said i'm actually not going to define

3998
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:29,680
i said i'm actually not going to define
 

3999
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,589
i said i'm actually not going to define
my success in terms of winning

my success in terms of winning
 

4001
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:34,710
my success in terms of winning
this contest i said i wanted to maximize

4002
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:34,720
this contest i said i wanted to maximize
 

4003
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:35,910
this contest i said i wanted to maximize
the number of the students

4004
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:35,920
the number of the students
 

4005
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,069
the number of the students
that i read about in the new york times

4006
01:03:38,069 --> 01:03:38,079
that i read about in the new york times
 

4007
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:39,270
that i read about in the new york times
in 20 years

4008
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:39,280
in 20 years
 

4009
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,589
in 20 years
oh yeah and the executive director of

4010
01:03:41,589 --> 01:03:41,599
oh yeah and the executive director of
 

4011
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:43,990
oh yeah and the executive director of
the mathematical association of america

4012
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:44,000
the mathematical association of america
 

4013
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,990
the mathematical association of america
was fully in support of this because

4014
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:46,000
was fully in support of this because
 

4015
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,829
was fully in support of this because
that's also how their philosophy is

4016
01:03:47,829 --> 01:03:47,839
that's also how their philosophy is
 

4017
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:49,910
that's also how their philosophy is
so in america the way we run this is

4018
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:49,920
so in america the way we run this is
 

4019
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:50,950
so in america the way we run this is
we're actually not

4020
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:50,960
we're actually not
 

4021
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,829
we're actually not
just training to win even though the

4022
01:03:53,829 --> 01:03:53,839
just training to win even though the
 

4023
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:55,270
just training to win even though the
students are very good and they can win

4024
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:55,280
students are very good and they can win
 

4025
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,390
students are very good and they can win
anyway

4026
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:56,400
anyway
 

4027
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,069
anyway
one reason for example i went and even

4028
01:03:58,069 --> 01:03:58,079
one reason for example i went and even
 

4029
01:03:58,079 --> 01:03:59,750
one reason for example i went and even
did the covid thing involving quite a

4030
01:03:59,750 --> 01:03:59,760
did the covid thing involving quite a
 

4031
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,430
did the covid thing involving quite a
few of them

4032
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:01,440
few of them
 

4033
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,270
few of them
is so that hopefully some of them get

4034
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:03,280
is so that hopefully some of them get
 

4035
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,750
is so that hopefully some of them get
ideas because in 20 30 years i won't

4036
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:05,760
ideas because in 20 30 years i won't
 

4037
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,670
ideas because in 20 30 years i won't
have the energy or the insight to solve

4038
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:07,680
have the energy or the insight to solve
 

4039
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:08,390
have the energy or the insight to solve
problems

4040
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:08,400
problems
 

4041
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,470
problems
we'll have another catastrophe and

4042
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:10,480
we'll have another catastrophe and
 

4043
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,910
we'll have another catastrophe and
hopefully some of these people will step

4044
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:11,920
hopefully some of these people will step
 

4045
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,029
hopefully some of these people will step
up and do it

4046
01:04:13,029 --> 01:04:13,039
up and do it
 

4047
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:14,549
up and do it
and ultimately have that long-term

4048
01:04:14,549 --> 01:04:14,559
and ultimately have that long-term
 

4049
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:17,190
and ultimately have that long-term
impact i wonder if this is scalable to

4050
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:17,200
impact i wonder if this is scalable to
 

4051
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,029
impact i wonder if this is scalable to
because that's such a great metric for

4052
01:04:19,029 --> 01:04:19,039
because that's such a great metric for
 

4053
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:20,309
because that's such a great metric for
education

4054
01:04:20,309 --> 01:04:20,319
education
 

4055
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:24,150

not how to get an a

on the test uh
 

4059
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,670
on the test uh
but how to have how to be on the cover

but how to have how to be on the cover
 

4061

for inventing something new and i

do you think that's generalizable to

4066
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:36,640
do you think that's generalizable to
 

4067
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,470
do you think that's generalizable to
education beyond just this particular

4068

education beyond just this particular
 

4069
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:39,510
education beyond just this particular
olympia like

4070
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:39,520
olympia like
 

4071
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,589
olympia like
it's even you're saying this feels like

4072
01:04:41,589 --> 01:04:41,599
it's even you're saying this feels like
 

4073
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:42,710
it's even you're saying this feels like
a rare statement

4074
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:42,720
a rare statement
 

4075
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,549
a rare statement
almost like a radical statement as a

01:04:44,549 --> 01:04:44,559
almost like a radical statement as a
 

4077
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:45,910
almost like a radical statement as a
goal for education

4078
01:04:45,910 --> 01:04:45,920
goal for education
 

4079
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,910
goal for education
so actually the way i teach my classes

4080
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:47,920
so actually the way i teach my classes
 

4081
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,430
so actually the way i teach my classes
at carnegie mellon which i will admit

4082
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:49,440
at carnegie mellon which i will admit
 

4083
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:50,630
at carnegie mellon which i will admit
right away is not

4084
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:50,640
right away is not
 

4085
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,309
right away is not
equivalent to the average in the world

4086
01:04:52,309 --> 01:04:52,319
equivalent to the average in the world
 

4087
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:53,670
equivalent to the average in the world
but it's already not

4088
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:53,680
but it's already not
 

4089
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,829
but it's already not
it's already not just the top 60 in the

4090
01:04:55,829 --> 01:04:55,839
it's already not just the top 60 in the
 

4091
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:57,430
it's already not just the top 60 in the
country as picked by something

4092
01:04:57,430 --> 01:04:57,440
country as picked by something
 

4093
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,750
country as picked by something
um let me just explain i have exams in

4094
01:04:59,750 --> 01:04:59,760
um let me just explain i have exams in
 

4095
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:00,950
um let me just explain i have exams in
my class which are 90

4096
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:00,960
my class which are 90
 

4097
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,309
my class which are 90
of the grade so the exams are the whole

4098
01:05:02,309 --> 01:05:02,319
of the grade so the exams are the whole
 

4099
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:04,230
of the grade so the exams are the whole
thing or most of the whole thing and

4100
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:04,240
thing or most of the whole thing and
 

4101
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,990
thing or most of the whole thing and
the way that i let students prepare for

4102
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:06,000
the way that i let students prepare for
 

4103
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,349
the way that i let students prepare for
the exams is i show them

4104
01:05:07,349 --> 01:05:07,359
the exams is i show them
 

4105
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:08,950
the exams is i show them
all the problems i've ever given on the

4106
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:08,960
all the problems i've ever given on the
 

4107
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,109
all the problems i've ever given on the
previous exams and the whole the exam

4108
01:05:11,109 --> 01:05:11,119
previous exams and the whole the exam
 

4109
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:12,710
previous exams and the whole the exam
that they will take is open notes they

4110
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:12,720
that they will take is open notes they
 

4111
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:13,829
that they will take is open notes they
can take all the notes they want on the

4112
01:05:13,829 --> 01:05:13,839
can take all the notes they want on the
 

4113
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:14,870
can take all the notes they want on the
previous problems

4114
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:14,880
previous problems
 

4115
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,470
previous problems
and the guarantee is that the exam

4116
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:16,480
and the guarantee is that the exam
 

4117
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,150
and the guarantee is that the exam
problems this time will have no overlap

4118
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:18,160
problems this time will have no overlap
 

4119
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,510
problems this time will have no overlap
with anything you've seen me give in the

4120
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:19,520
with anything you've seen me give in the
 

4121
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:20,870
with anything you've seen me give in the
past

4122
01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:20,880
past
 

4123
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,470
past
as well as no overlap with anything i

4124
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:22,480
as well as no overlap with anything i
 

4125
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,230
as well as no overlap with anything i
taught in the class

4126
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:24,240
taught in the class
 

4127
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:27,349
taught in the class
so the entire exam is invention

4128
01:05:27,349 --> 01:05:27,359
so the entire exam is invention
 

4129
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:30,230
so the entire exam is invention
wow but that's how i go right my point

4130
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:30,240
wow but that's how i go right my point
 

4131
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:30,470
wow but that's how i go right my point
is

4132
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:30,480
is
 

4133
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,710
is
i have explained to people when i teach

4134
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:32,720
i have explained to people when i teach
 

4135
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,109
i have explained to people when i teach
you i don't want you to have remembered

4136
01:05:35,109 --> 01:05:35,119
you i don't want you to have remembered
 

4137
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:36,549
you i don't want you to have remembered
a method i showed you

4138
01:05:36,549 --> 01:05:36,559
a method i showed you
 

4139
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:38,150
a method i showed you
i want you to have learned enough about

4140
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:38,160
i want you to have learned enough about
 

4141
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,390
i want you to have learned enough about
this area that if you face a new

4142
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:40,400
this area that if you face a new
 

4143
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,750
this area that if you face a new
question which i came up with the night

4144
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:41,760
question which i came up with the night
 

4145
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:42,470
question which i came up with the night
before

4146
01:05:42,470 --> 01:05:42,480
before
 

4147
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,390
before
by thinking about like what could i ask

4148
01:05:44,390 --> 01:05:44,400
by thinking about like what could i ask
 

4149
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:45,990
by thinking about like what could i ask
that i have never asked before

4150
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:46,000
that i have never asked before
 

4151
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,589
that i have never asked before
oh that's cute i wonder what the answer

4152
01:05:47,589 --> 01:05:47,599
oh that's cute i wonder what the answer
 

4153
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:49,190
oh that's cute i wonder what the answer
is ah that's an exam problem that's

4154
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:49,200
is ah that's an exam problem that's
 

4155
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,430
is ah that's an exam problem that's
exactly what i do before the exam

4156
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:51,440
exactly what i do before the exam
 

4157
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,870
exactly what i do before the exam
and then that's what i want them to

4158
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:52,880
and then that's what i want them to
 

4159
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,950
and then that's what i want them to
learn yeah and the first exam usually

4160
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:54,960
learn yeah and the first exam usually
 

4161
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,390
learn yeah and the first exam usually
people have a rough time because it's

4162
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:56,400
people have a rough time because it's
 

4163
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,150
people have a rough time because it's
like what what kind of crazy class is

4164
01:05:58,150 --> 01:05:58,160
like what what kind of crazy class is
 

4165
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,430
like what what kind of crazy class is
this the professor doesn't

4166
01:05:59,430 --> 01:05:59,440
this the professor doesn't
 

4167
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,150
this the professor doesn't
teach you anything for the exam but then

4168
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:02,160
teach you anything for the exam but then
 

4169
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,829
teach you anything for the exam but then
by the second or third and by the time

4170
01:06:03,829 --> 01:06:03,839
by the second or third and by the time
 

4171
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:05,190
by the second or third and by the time
they finish the class

4172
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:05,200
they finish the class
 

4173
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,549
they finish the class
they have learned how to solve anything

4174
01:06:08,549 --> 01:06:08,559
they have learned how to solve anything
 

4175
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:10,390
they have learned how to solve anything
in the area how to invent how they

4176
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:10,400
in the area how to invent how they
 

4177
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,150
in the area how to invent how they
intend in that area yeah

4178
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:12,160
intend in that area yeah
 

4179
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,230
intend in that area yeah
can we uh walk back to the the

4180
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:14,240
can we uh walk back to the the
 

4181
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,750
can we uh walk back to the the
mathematical olympia yes what's the

4182
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:15,760
mathematical olympia yes what's the
 

4183
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:18,390
mathematical olympia yes what's the
scoring and format like

4184
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:18,400
scoring and format like
 

4185
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,430
scoring and format like
and also what does it take to win so the

4186
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:21,440
and also what does it take to win so the
 

4187
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:22,630
and also what does it take to win so the
way it works is that

4188
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:22,640
way it works is that
 

4189
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:25,670
way it works is that
each of the six students

4190
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:25,680
each of the six students
 

4191
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,190
each of the six students
do the problems and there are six

4192
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:27,200
do the problems and there are six
 

4193
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,029
do the problems and there are six
problems all the problems are equally

4194
01:06:29,029 --> 01:06:29,039
problems all the problems are equally
 

4195
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:30,710
problems all the problems are equally
weighted so each one's worth seven

4196
01:06:30,710 --> 01:06:30,720
weighted so each one's worth seven
 

4197
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,150
weighted so each one's worth seven
points that means that

4198
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:32,160
points that means that
 

4199
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,390
points that means that
your maximum score is six problems times

4200
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:34,400
your maximum score is six problems times
 

4201
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,349
your maximum score is six problems times
seven points which is

4202
01:06:35,349 --> 01:06:35,359
seven points which is
 

4203
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:38,470
seven points which is
the nice number of 42. and now

4204
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:38,480
the nice number of 42. and now
 

4205
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,309
the nice number of 42. and now
the way that they're scored by the way

4206
01:06:40,309 --> 01:06:40,319
the way that they're scored by the way
 

4207
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:41,829
the way that they're scored by the way
is there's partial credit so the

4208
01:06:41,829 --> 01:06:41,839
is there's partial credit so the
 

4209
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:43,190
is there's partial credit so the
question is asking you

4210
01:06:43,190 --> 01:06:43,200
question is asking you
 

4211
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,309
question is asking you
explain why this weird fact is true

4212
01:06:46,309 --> 01:06:46,319
explain why this weird fact is true
 

4213
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:48,230
explain why this weird fact is true
okay if you explain by you get seven

4214
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:48,240
okay if you explain by you get seven
 

4215
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:49,990
okay if you explain by you get seven
points if you make minor mistake maybe

4216
01:06:49,990 --> 01:06:50,000
points if you make minor mistake maybe
 

4217
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,190
points if you make minor mistake maybe
you get six points

4218
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:51,200
you get six points
 

4219
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,349
you get six points
but if you don't succeed in explaining

4220
01:06:53,349 --> 01:06:53,359
but if you don't succeed in explaining
 

4221
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:54,549
but if you don't succeed in explaining
why but you explain

4222
01:06:54,549 --> 01:06:54,559
why but you explain
 

4223
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:57,910
why but you explain
some other true fact

4224
01:06:57,910 --> 01:06:57,920
some other true fact
 

4225
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:02,069
some other true fact
which is along the way of proving it

4226
01:07:02,069 --> 01:07:02,079
which is along the way of proving it
 

4227
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:04,470
which is along the way of proving it
then you get partial credit and and

4228
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:04,480
then you get partial credit and and
 

4229
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,150
then you get partial credit and and
actually now this is tricky because

4230
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:06,160
actually now this is tricky because
 

4231
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,910
actually now this is tricky because
how do you score such a thing it's not

4232
01:07:07,910 --> 01:07:07,920
how do you score such a thing it's not
 

4233
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,990
how do you score such a thing it's not
like it was the answer was

4234
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:10,000
like it was the answer was
 

4235
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,029
like it was the answer was
72 and you wrote 71 and it's close right

4236
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:13,039
72 and you wrote 71 and it's close right
 

4237
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:13,990
72 and you wrote 71 and it's close right
the answer is 72

4238
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:14,000
the answer is 72
 

4239
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,910
the answer is 72
and you wrote 36 oh but that's pretty

4240
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:15,920
and you wrote 36 oh but that's pretty
 

4241
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:17,349
and you wrote 36 oh but that's pretty
close because you were you know you

4242
01:07:17,349 --> 01:07:17,359
close because you were you know you
 

4243
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:18,950
close because you were you know you
that maybe you're just off by it by the

4244
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:18,960
that maybe you're just off by it by the
 

4245
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,549
that maybe you're just off by it by the
way they're not numerical anyway but i'm

4246
01:07:20,549 --> 01:07:20,559
way they're not numerical anyway but i'm
 

4247
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:21,430
way they're not numerical anyway but i'm
just giving some

4248
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:21,440
just giving some
 

4249
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,910
just giving some
numerical analog to the way the scoring

4250
01:07:23,910 --> 01:07:23,920
numerical analog to the way the scoring
 

4251
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:24,470
numerical analog to the way the scoring
might work

4252
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:24,480
might work
 

4253
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,950
might work
they're all essays and that's where i

4254
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:26,960
they're all essays and that's where i
 

4255
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:27,589
they're all essays and that's where i
guess i have

4256
01:07:27,589 --> 01:07:27,599
guess i have
 

4257
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,270
guess i have
some role as well as some other people

some role as well as some other people
 

4259

and they're just looking over these exam

4288
01:07:57,190 --> 01:07:57,200
and they're just looking over these exam
 

4289

and they're just looking over these exam
papers saying

papers saying
 

4291
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,789
papers saying
well how many points is this worth based

4292
01:08:00,789 --> 01:08:00,799
well how many points is this worth based
 

4293
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:02,950
well how many points is this worth based
on some rubric that has been designed

4294
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:02,960
on some rubric that has been designed
 

4295
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,829
on some rubric that has been designed
and this is a negotiation process where

4296
01:08:05,829 --> 01:08:05,839
and this is a negotiation process where
 

4297
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:06,470
and this is a negotiation process where
we're not

4298
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:06,480
we're not
 

4299
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,069
we're not
we're not trying to bargain and get the

4300
01:08:08,069 --> 01:08:08,079
we're not trying to bargain and get the
 

4301
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:09,990
we're not trying to bargain and get the
best score we can in fact sometimes we

4302
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:10,000
best score we can in fact sometimes we
 

4303
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,589
best score we can in fact sometimes we
go to this table and we will say

4304
01:08:11,589 --> 01:08:11,599
go to this table and we will say
 

4305
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:13,109
go to this table and we will say
we think we want less than what you gave

4306
01:08:13,109 --> 01:08:13,119
we think we want less than what you gave
 

4307
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:15,270
we think we want less than what you gave
us this is how this is how our

4308
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:15,280
us this is how this is how our
 

4309
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,870
us this is how this is how our
these are our principles if you give us

4310
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:16,880
these are our principles if you give us
 

4311
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,870
these are our principles if you give us
too much we say no you gave us too much

4312
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:18,880
too much we say no you gave us too much
 

4313
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:21,110
too much we say no you gave us too much
we do that however the reason why this

4314
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:21,120
we do that however the reason why this
 

4315
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,229
we do that however the reason why this
is an interesting process

4316
01:08:22,229 --> 01:08:22,239
is an interesting process
 

4317
01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:23,669
is an interesting process
is because if you can imagine every

4318
01:08:23,669 --> 01:08:23,679
is because if you can imagine every
 

4319
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,269
is because if you can imagine every
country which is participating has its

4320
01:08:25,269 --> 01:08:25,279
country which is participating has its
 

4321
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:26,630
country which is participating has its
own language

4322
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:26,640
own language
 

4323
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:27,749
own language
and so if you're trying to grade the

4324
01:08:27,749 --> 01:08:27,759
and so if you're trying to grade the
 

4325
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:29,110
and so if you're trying to grade the
mongolian scripts and they're written in

4326
01:08:29,110 --> 01:08:29,120
mongolian scripts and they're written in
 

4327
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,950
mongolian scripts and they're written in
mongolia

4328
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:30,960
mongolia
 

4329
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,550
mongolia
if you don't read mongolian which most

4330
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:32,560
if you don't read mongolian which most
 

4331
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:33,990
if you don't read mongolian which most
people don't then the

4332
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:34,000
people don't then the
 

4333
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,789
people don't then the
the coaches are explaining to you this

4334
01:08:36,789 --> 01:08:36,799
the coaches are explaining to you this
 

4335
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:38,630
the coaches are explaining to you this
is what the student has written

4336
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:38,640
is what the student has written
 

4337
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,390
is what the student has written
it's actually quite interesting process

4338
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:40,400
it's actually quite interesting process
 

4339
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,149
it's actually quite interesting process
it's almost like um

4340
01:08:42,149 --> 01:08:42,159
it's almost like um
 

4341
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:45,669
it's almost like um
like a jury yeah you have you have uh

4342
01:08:45,669 --> 01:08:45,679
like a jury yeah you have you have uh
 

4343
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:47,349
like a jury yeah you have you have uh
in the american legal system you have a

4344
01:08:47,349 --> 01:08:47,359
in the american legal system you have a
 

4345
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:49,910
in the american legal system you have a
jury that where they're deliberating

4346
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:49,920
jury that where they're deliberating
 

4347
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:53,030
jury that where they're deliberating
but unlike a jury there's the members of

4348
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:53,040
but unlike a jury there's the members of
 

4349
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:53,590
but unlike a jury there's the members of
the jury

4350
01:08:53,590 --> 01:08:53,600
the jury
 

4351
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,749
the jury
speak in different languages sometimes

4352
01:08:55,749 --> 01:08:55,759
speak in different languages sometimes
 

4353
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:57,110
speak in different languages sometimes
that's fascinating

4354
01:08:57,110 --> 01:08:57,120
that's fascinating
 

4355
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:00,709
that's fascinating
but uh i mean it's hard to know what to

4356
01:09:00,709 --> 01:09:00,719
but uh i mean it's hard to know what to
 

4357
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:01,510
but uh i mean it's hard to know what to
do

4358
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:01,520
do
 

4359
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,590
do
because it's probably really really

4360
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:03,600
because it's probably really really
 

4361
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,749
because it's probably really really
competitive

4362
01:09:05,749 --> 01:09:05,759
competitive
 

4363
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:10,229
competitive
but your sense is that ultimately people

4364
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:10,239
but your sense is that ultimately people
 

4365
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:13,189
but your sense is that ultimately people
like how do you prevent manipulation

4366
01:09:13,189 --> 01:09:13,199
like how do you prevent manipulation
 

4367
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:13,990
like how do you prevent manipulation
here

4368
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:14,000
here
 

4369
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,189
here
right well we just hope that it's not

4370
01:09:17,189 --> 01:09:17,199
right well we just hope that it's not
 

4371
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:17,990
right well we just hope that it's not
happening

4372
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:18,000
happening
 

4373
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,630
happening
so so we write in english therefore

4374
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:20,640
so so we write in english therefore
 

4375
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,390
so so we write in english therefore
everything that the u.s does

4376
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:22,400
everything that the u.s does
 

4377
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,709
everything that the u.s does
everyone can look at so it's a it's very

4378
01:09:24,709 --> 01:09:24,719
everyone can look at so it's a it's very
 

4379
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:25,910
everyone can look at so it's a it's very
hard for me it's very hard for you to

4380
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:25,920
hard for me it's very hard for you to
 

4381
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:26,870
hard for me it's very hard for you to
manipulate

4382
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:26,880
manipulate
 

4383
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,349
manipulate
we don't manipulate we only hope that

4384
01:09:29,349 --> 01:09:29,359
we don't manipulate we only hope that
 

4385
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:30,390
we don't manipulate we only hope that
other people aren't

4386
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:30,400
other people aren't
 

4387
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,309
other people aren't
but at the same time as you see our

4388
01:09:32,309 --> 01:09:32,319
but at the same time as you see our
 

4389
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:34,470
but at the same time as you see our
philosophy was we want to use this as a

4390
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:34,480
philosophy was we want to use this as a
 

4391
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:36,470
philosophy was we want to use this as a
way to develop general talent

4392
01:09:36,470 --> 01:09:36,480
way to develop general talent
 

4393
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,309
way to develop general talent
and although we do this for the six

4394
01:09:38,309 --> 01:09:38,319
and although we do this for the six
 

4395
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:40,229
and although we do this for the six
people who go to the international math

4396
01:09:40,229 --> 01:09:40,239
people who go to the international math
 

4397
01:09:40,239 --> 01:09:41,349
people who go to the international math
olympiad

4398
01:09:41,349 --> 01:09:41,359
olympiad
 

4399
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:43,669
olympiad
we really want that everyone at any

4400
01:09:43,669 --> 01:09:43,679
we really want that everyone at any
 

4401
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,910
we really want that everyone at any
touch at any stage of this process

4402
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:45,920
touch at any stage of this process
 

4403
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,430
touch at any stage of this process
get some skills that can help to

4404
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:47,440
get some skills that can help to
 

4405
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:49,669
get some skills that can help to
contribute more later so

4406
01:09:49,669 --> 01:09:49,679
contribute more later so
 

4407
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:51,669
contribute more later so
i don't know if you can uh say something

4408
01:09:51,669 --> 01:09:51,679
i don't know if you can uh say something
 

4409
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:52,870
i don't know if you can uh say something
insightful to this

4410
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:52,880
insightful to this
 

4411
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,110
insightful to this
question but what do you think makes a

4412
01:09:55,110 --> 01:09:55,120
question but what do you think makes a
 

4413
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,110
question but what do you think makes a
really hard math problem

4414
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:57,120
really hard math problem
 

4415
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:59,350
really hard math problem
on on this olympiad maybe in the courses

4416
01:09:59,350 --> 01:09:59,360
on on this olympiad maybe in the courses
 

4417
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,470
on on this olympiad maybe in the courses
you teach

4418
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:00,480
you teach
 

4419
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:03,669
you teach
or in general what makes for a hard

4420
01:10:03,669 --> 01:10:03,679
or in general what makes for a hard
 

4421
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:05,750
or in general what makes for a hard
problem you've seen i'm sure a lot of

4422
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:05,760
problem you've seen i'm sure a lot of
 

4423
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,030
problem you've seen i'm sure a lot of
really difficult problems

4424
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:07,040
really difficult problems
 

4425
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,270
really difficult problems
what makes a heart problem so i could

4426
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:09,280
what makes a heart problem so i could
 

4427
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,990
what makes a heart problem so i could
quantify it by the number of leaps of

4428
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:12,000
quantify it by the number of leaps of
 

4429
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:12,870
quantify it by the number of leaps of
insight

4430
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:12,880
insight
 

4431
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,709
insight
of changes of perspective that are along

4432
01:10:14,709 --> 01:10:14,719
of changes of perspective that are along
 

4433
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:16,070
of changes of perspective that are along
the way and here's why

4434
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:16,080
the way and here's why
 

4435
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,590
the way and here's why
it's this is like a very theoretical

4436
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:17,600
it's this is like a very theoretical
 

4437
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,270
it's this is like a very theoretical
computer science way of looking at it

4438
01:10:19,270 --> 01:10:19,280
computer science way of looking at it
 

4439
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:22,550
computer science way of looking at it
okay it's the is that each reframing of

4440
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:22,560
okay it's the is that each reframing of
 

4441
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,630
okay it's the is that each reframing of
the problem and using of some tool i

4442
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:24,640
the problem and using of some tool i
 

4443
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:25,990
the problem and using of some tool i
actually call that a leap of insight

4444
01:10:25,990 --> 01:10:26,000
actually call that a leap of insight
 

4445
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,430
actually call that a leap of insight
when you say oh wow

4446
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:27,440
when you say oh wow
 

4447
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,830
when you say oh wow
now i see i should kind of put these

4448
01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:29,840
now i see i should kind of put these
 

4449
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,510
now i see i should kind of put these
plugs into those sockets

4450
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:31,520
plugs into those sockets
 

4451
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,430
plugs into those sockets
like so yes and suddenly i get to use

4452
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:33,440
like so yes and suddenly i get to use
 

4453
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,669
like so yes and suddenly i get to use
that machine oh but i'm not done yet

4454
01:10:35,669 --> 01:10:35,679
that machine oh but i'm not done yet
 

4455
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:37,990
that machine oh but i'm not done yet
now i need to do it again each such step

4456
01:10:37,990 --> 01:10:38,000
now i need to do it again each such step
 

4457
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,189
now i need to do it again each such step
is a large

4458
01:10:39,189 --> 01:10:39,199
is a large
 

4459
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:40,950
is a large
possible large fan out in the search

4460
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:40,960
possible large fan out in the search
 

4461
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,189
possible large fan out in the search
space the number of these

4462
01:10:43,189 --> 01:10:43,199
space the number of these
 

4463
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:45,669
space the number of these
tells you the exponent the base of the

4464
01:10:45,669 --> 01:10:45,679
tells you the exponent the base of the
 

4465
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:47,270
tells you the exponent the base of the
exponent is like how big

4466
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:47,280
exponent is like how big
 

4467
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,870
exponent is like how big
how many different possibilities you

4468
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:48,880
how many different possibilities you
 

4469
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,030
how many different possibilities you
could try and that's

4470
01:10:51,030 --> 01:10:51,040
could try and that's
 

4471
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,110
could try and that's
that's actually why like if you have a

4472
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:53,120
that's actually why like if you have a
 

4473
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,950
that's actually why like if you have a
three inside problem

4474
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:54,960
three inside problem
 

4475
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,270
three inside problem
that is not three times as hard as a one

4476
01:10:57,270 --> 01:10:57,280
that is not three times as hard as a one
 

4477
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:58,229
that is not three times as hard as a one
inside problem

4478
01:10:58,229 --> 01:10:58,239
inside problem
 

4479
01:10:58,239 --> 01:10:59,830
inside problem
because after you've made the one inside

4480
01:10:59,830 --> 01:10:59,840
because after you've made the one inside
 

4481
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,510
because after you've made the one inside
it's not clear that that was the right

4482
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:01,520
it's not clear that that was the right
 

4483
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:04,390
it's not clear that that was the right
track necessarily well unless there's

4484
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:04,400
track necessarily well unless there's
 

4485
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:05,590
track necessarily well unless there's
still a branching

4486
01:11:05,590 --> 01:11:05,600
still a branching
 

4487
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,100
still a branching
uh of possible yeah

4488
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:07,110
uh of possible yeah
 

4489
01:11:07,110 --> 01:11:10,310
uh of possible yeah
[Laughter]

4490
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:10,320
[Laughter]
 

4491
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,070
[Laughter]
you're saying there's problems like on

4492
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:12,080
you're saying there's problems like on
 

4493
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,669
you're saying there's problems like on
the math olympia that requires more than

4494
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:13,679
the math olympia that requires more than
 

4495
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:14,790
the math olympia that requires more than
one insight yes

4496
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:14,800
one insight yes
 

4497
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,310
one insight yes
those are the hard ones and also i can

4498
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:16,320
those are the hard ones and also i can
 

4499
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,070
those are the hard ones and also i can
tell you how how you can tell

4500
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:18,080
tell you how how you can tell
 

4501
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,149
tell you how how you can tell
so this is how i also taught myself math

4502
01:11:20,149 --> 01:11:20,159
so this is how i also taught myself math
 

4503
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:21,189
so this is how i also taught myself math
when i was in college

4504
01:11:21,189 --> 01:11:21,199
when i was in college
 

4505
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:23,669
when i was in college
so in if you are taking uh not taught

4506
01:11:23,669 --> 01:11:23,679
so in if you are taking uh not taught
 

4507
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:25,270
so in if you are taking uh not taught
myself i was taking classes of course

4508
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:25,280
myself i was taking classes of course
 

4509
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,110
myself i was taking classes of course
but i was trying to read the textbook

4510
01:11:27,110 --> 01:11:27,120
but i was trying to read the textbook
 

4511
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,550
but i was trying to read the textbook
and i found out i was very bad at

4512
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:28,560
and i found out i was very bad at
 

4513
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:29,750
and i found out i was very bad at
reading math textbooks

4514
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:29,760
reading math textbooks
 

4515
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,149
reading math textbooks
a math textbook has a long page of stuff

4516
01:11:32,149 --> 01:11:32,159
a math textbook has a long page of stuff
 

4517
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:33,110
a math textbook has a long page of stuff
that is all true

4518
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:33,120
that is all true
 

4519
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,870
that is all true
which after you read the page you have

4520
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:34,880
which after you read the page you have
 

4521
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,149
which after you read the page you have
no idea what you just read

4522
01:11:36,149 --> 01:11:36,159
no idea what you just read
 

4523
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:38,630
no idea what you just read
yeah this is just a good summary of a

4524
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:38,640
yeah this is just a good summary of a
 

4525
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:39,590
yeah this is just a good summary of a
math textbook

4526
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:39,600
math textbook
 

4527
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,790
math textbook
okay yeah because it's it's not clear

4528
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:42,800
okay yeah because it's it's not clear
 

4529
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,030
okay yeah because it's it's not clear
why anything was done that way and yes

4530
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:45,040
why anything was done that way and yes
 

4531
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,790
why anything was done that way and yes
everything is true but how the heck did

4532
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:46,800
everything is true but how the heck did
 

4533
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:47,750
everything is true but how the heck did
anyone think of that

4534
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:47,760
anyone think of that
 

4535
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,149
anyone think of that
so the way that i taught myself math

4536
01:11:50,149 --> 01:11:50,159
so the way that i taught myself math
 

4537
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:50,790
so the way that i taught myself math
eventually

4538
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:50,800
eventually
 

4539
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,669
eventually
was the way i read a math textbook is i

4540
01:11:53,669 --> 01:11:53,679
was the way i read a math textbook is i
 

4541
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:54,070
was the way i read a math textbook is i
would

4542
01:11:54,070 --> 01:11:54,080
would
 

4543
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,229
would
look at the theorem statement i would

4544
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:56,239
look at the theorem statement i would
 

4545
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:57,270
look at the theorem statement i would
look at the length

4546
01:11:57,270 --> 01:11:57,280
look at the length
 

4547
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,669
look at the length
of the proof and then i would close the

4548
01:11:59,669 --> 01:11:59,679
of the proof and then i would close the
 

4549
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:01,270
of the proof and then i would close the
book and attempt to reprove it myself

4550
01:12:01,270 --> 01:12:01,280
book and attempt to reprove it myself
 

4551
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:04,070
book and attempt to reprove it myself
yeah now that's brilliant the length of

4552
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:04,080
yeah now that's brilliant the length of
 

4553
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:04,870
yeah now that's brilliant the length of
the proof

4554
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:04,880
the proof
 

4555
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,709
the proof
is telling you the number of insights

4556
01:12:06,709 --> 01:12:06,719
is telling you the number of insights
 

4557
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:07,990
is telling you the number of insights
because the length of the proof

4558
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:08,000
because the length of the proof
 

4559
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,790
because the length of the proof
is linear in the number of insights that

4560
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:10,800
is linear in the number of insights that
 

4561
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,149
is linear in the number of insights that
each insight takes space

4562
01:12:12,149 --> 01:12:12,159
each insight takes space
 

4563
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:14,229
each insight takes space
yeah and if i know that it's a short

4564
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:14,239
yeah and if i know that it's a short
 

4565
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:15,510
yeah and if i know that it's a short
proof i know that there's only one

4566
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:15,520
proof i know that there's only one
 

4567
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:16,070
proof i know that there's only one
insight

4568
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:16,080
insight
 

4569
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,229
insight
so when i'm doing my own way of solving

4570
01:12:18,229 --> 01:12:18,239
so when i'm doing my own way of solving
 

4571
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:20,070
so when i'm doing my own way of solving
the problem like so i mean finding the

4572
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:20,080
the problem like so i mean finding the
 

4573
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:20,470
the problem like so i mean finding the
proof

4574
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:20,480
proof
 

4575
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,470
proof
i quit if i'm if i have to do too many

4576
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:22,480
i quit if i'm if i have to do too many
 

4577
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,229
i quit if i'm if i have to do too many
pluggings it's equivalent to a math

4578
01:12:24,229 --> 01:12:24,239
pluggings it's equivalent to a math
 

4579
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:24,790
pluggings it's equivalent to a math
contest

4580
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:24,800
contest
 

4581
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,229
contest
in a math context i look is it problem

4582
01:12:26,229 --> 01:12:26,239
in a math context i look is it problem
 

4583
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:27,910
in a math context i look is it problem
one two or three that tells me how many

4584
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:27,920
one two or three that tells me how many
 

4585
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:28,790
one two or three that tells me how many
insights there are

4586
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:28,800
insights there are
 

4587
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,149
insights there are
this is exactly what i did that's

4588
01:12:30,149 --> 01:12:30,159
this is exactly what i did that's
 

4589
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:32,229
this is exactly what i did that's
brilliant linear in the number i don't

4590
01:12:32,229 --> 01:12:32,239
brilliant linear in the number i don't
 

4591
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:32,550
brilliant linear in the number i don't
know

4592
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:32,560
know
 

4593
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:35,510
know
i i think um well it's possible that

4594
01:12:35,510 --> 01:12:35,520
i i think um well it's possible that
 

4595
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:36,229
i i think um well it's possible that
that's true

4596
01:12:36,229 --> 01:12:36,239
that's true
 

4597
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:37,189
that's true
approximately approximately

4598
01:12:37,189 --> 01:12:37,199
approximately approximately
 

4599
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:40,630
approximately approximately
approximately yeah just i don't know uh

4600
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:40,640
approximately yeah just i don't know uh
 

4601
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:41,830
approximately yeah just i don't know uh
somebody out there is going to try to

4602
01:12:41,830 --> 01:12:41,840
somebody out there is going to try to
 

4603
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,750
somebody out there is going to try to
formally prove this oh no i mean you're

4604
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:43,760
formally prove this oh no i mean you're
 

4605
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:44,070
formally prove this oh no i mean you're
right

4606
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:44,080
right
 

4607
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,510
right
there are cases where maybe it's not

4608
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:45,520
there are cases where maybe it's not
 

4609
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,430
there are cases where maybe it's not
quite linear but in general well some of

4610
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:47,440
quite linear but in general well some of
 

4611
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,270
quite linear but in general well some of
it's notation too and some of it is uh

4612
01:12:49,270 --> 01:12:49,280
it's notation too and some of it is uh
 

4613
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,030
it's notation too and some of it is uh
style and all those kinds of things but

4614
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:51,040

yeah that's what i was using that's

4624
01:12:57,910 --> 01:12:57,920
yeah that's what i was using that's
 

4625
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,590
yeah that's what i was using that's
hilarious because you know if it's a

4626
01:12:59,590 --> 01:12:59,600
hilarious because you know if it's a
 

4627
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:00,950
hilarious because you know if it's a
two-page proof you just know this is

4628
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:00,960
two-page proof you just know this is
 

4629
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,229
two-page proof you just know this is
going to be insane

4630
01:13:02,229 --> 01:13:02,239
going to be insane
 

4631
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:04,790
going to be insane
right that's the uh that's the scary

4632
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:04,800
right that's the uh that's the scary
 

4633
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,630
right that's the uh that's the scary
thing about insights

4634
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:06,640
thing about insights
 

4635
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,550
thing about insights
uh you look like andrew wiles working on

4636
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:08,560
uh you look like andrew wiles working on
 

4637
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:11,510
uh you look like andrew wiles working on
the firm oz last theorem

4638
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:11,520
the firm oz last theorem
 

4639
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,630
the firm oz last theorem
is you don't know something seems like a

4640
01:13:14,630 --> 01:13:14,640
is you don't know something seems like a
 

4641
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,070
is you don't know something seems like a
good idea

4642
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:16,080
good idea
 

4643
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,070
good idea
and you have that idea and it feels like

4644
01:13:18,070 --> 01:13:18,080
and you have that idea and it feels like
 

4645
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,149
and you have that idea and it feels like
this is a leap

4646
01:13:20,149 --> 01:13:20,159
this is a leap
 

4647
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:22,470
this is a leap
like a totally new way to see it but you

4648
01:13:22,470 --> 01:13:22,480
like a totally new way to see it but you
 

4649
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,830
like a totally new way to see it but you
have no idea if it's

4650
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:23,840
have no idea if it's
 

4651
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,470
have no idea if it's
at all useful uh even if you think it's

4652
01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:26,480
at all useful uh even if you think it's
 

4653
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,550
at all useful uh even if you think it's
correct you have no idea if this is like

4654
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:28,560
correct you have no idea if this is like
 

4655
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,390
correct you have no idea if this is like
going to go down a path that's

4656
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:30,400
going to go down a path that's
 

4657
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,390
going to go down a path that's
completely counterproductive

4658
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:32,400
completely counterproductive
 

4659
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:35,590
completely counterproductive
or not productive at all that's

4660
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:35,600
or not productive at all that's
 

4661
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:38,550
or not productive at all that's
that's a crappy thing about invention is

4662
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:38,560
that's a crappy thing about invention is
 

4663
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:39,270
that's a crappy thing about invention is
um

4664
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:39,280
um
 

4665
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,590
um
like i have i'm sure you do i have a lot

4666
01:13:41,590 --> 01:13:41,600
like i have i'm sure you do i have a lot
 

4667
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,550
like i have i'm sure you do i have a lot
of really good ideas every single day

4668
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:44,560
of really good ideas every single day
 

4669
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:48,550
of really good ideas every single day
but like and then i'll i'll go inside my

4670
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:48,560
but like and then i'll i'll go inside my
 

4671
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:49,510
but like and then i'll i'll go inside my
head along them

4672
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:49,520
head along them
 

4673
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:52,310
head along them
along that little trajectory but it

4674
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:52,320
along that little trajectory but it
 

4675
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,550
along that little trajectory but it
could be just a total waste

4676
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:54,560
could be just a total waste
 

4677
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,550
could be just a total waste
and it's that i that you know what that

4678
01:13:56,550 --> 01:13:56,560
and it's that i that you know what that
 

4679
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,229
and it's that i that you know what that
feels like it just feels like

4680
01:13:58,229 --> 01:13:58,239
feels like it just feels like
 

4681
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:00,390
feels like it just feels like
patience is required not to get excited

4682
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:00,400
patience is required not to get excited
 

4683
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,750
patience is required not to get excited
any one thing

4684
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:01,760
any one thing
 

4685
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,590
any one thing
so i think this is interesting because

4686
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:03,600
so i think this is interesting because
 

4687
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,189
so i think this is interesting because
you raised andrew biles he spent

4688
01:14:05,189 --> 01:14:05,199
you raised andrew biles he spent
 

4689
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:07,270
you raised andrew biles he spent
seven years attacking the same thing

4690
01:14:07,270 --> 01:14:07,280
seven years attacking the same thing
 

4691
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,310
seven years attacking the same thing
yeah right

4692
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:08,320
yeah right
 

4693
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,310
yeah right
and and so i think that what attracts

4694
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:10,320
and and so i think that what attracts
 

4695
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,229
and and so i think that what attracts
professional researchers to this

4696
01:14:12,229 --> 01:14:12,239
professional researchers to this
 

4697
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:14,709
professional researchers to this
is because even though it's very painful

4698
01:14:14,709 --> 01:14:14,719
is because even though it's very painful
 

4699
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:16,630
is because even though it's very painful
that you keep fighting with something

4700
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:16,640
that you keep fighting with something
 

4701
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,350
that you keep fighting with something
when you finally find the right insights

4702
01:14:19,350 --> 01:14:19,360
when you finally find the right insights
 

4703
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:20,470
when you finally find the right insights
and string them together

4704
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:20,480
and string them together
 

4705
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:23,590
and string them together
it feels really good so well there's

4706
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:23,600
it feels really good so well there's
 

4707
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:24,229
it feels really good so well there's
also like

4708
01:14:24,229 --> 01:14:24,239
also like
 

4709
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:27,590
also like
short term it feels good to

4710
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:27,600
short term it feels good to
 

4711
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:31,350
short term it feels good to
to uh whether it's real or not

4712
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:31,360
to uh whether it's real or not
 

4713
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,430
to uh whether it's real or not
to pretend like you've solved something

4714
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:33,440
to pretend like you've solved something
 

4715
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,590
to pretend like you've solved something
in the sense like you have an insight

4716
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:35,600
in the sense like you have an insight
 

4717
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,189
in the sense like you have an insight
and there's a sense like this might be

4718
01:14:37,189 --> 01:14:37,199
and there's a sense like this might be
 

4719
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:38,950
and there's a sense like this might be
the insight that solves it

4720
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:38,960
the insight that solves it
 

4721
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:42,390
the insight that solves it
so at least for me i just enjoy

4722
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:42,400
so at least for me i just enjoy
 

4723
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,950
so at least for me i just enjoy
that rush of positivity even though i

4724
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:44,960
that rush of positivity even though i
 

4725
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:46,790
that rush of positivity even though i
know statistically speaking is probably

4726
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:46,800
know statistically speaking is probably
 

4727
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,390
know statistically speaking is probably
going to be a dead end

4728
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:48,400
going to be a dead end
 

4729
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,910
going to be a dead end
i'm the same way i'm the same way in

4730
01:14:49,910 --> 01:14:49,920
i'm the same way i'm the same way in
 

4731
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,510
i'm the same way i'm the same way in
fact that's how i know whether

4732
01:14:51,510 --> 01:14:51,520
fact that's how i know whether
 

4733
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,350
fact that's how i know whether
i might want to keep thinking about this

4734
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:53,360
i might want to keep thinking about this
 

4735
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,350
i might want to keep thinking about this
general problem it's like if i still see

4736
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:55,360
general problem it's like if i still see
 

4737
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:55,990
general problem it's like if i still see
that i'm getting

4738
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:56,000
that i'm getting
 

4739
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,870
that i'm getting
some insights i'm not at a dead end yet

4740
01:14:58,870 --> 01:14:58,880
some insights i'm not at a dead end yet
 

4741
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,229
some insights i'm not at a dead end yet
but that's also where i learned

4742
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:00,239
but that's also where i learned
 

4743
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:02,070
but that's also where i learned
something from my phd advisor actually

4744
01:15:02,070 --> 01:15:02,080
something from my phd advisor actually
 

4745
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:02,709
something from my phd advisor actually
he was a

incredible person
 

4757
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:15,430
incredible person
but one thing i learned was choose the

4758
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:15,440
but one thing i learned was choose the
 

4759
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,590
but one thing i learned was choose the
problems to work on

4760
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:17,600
problems to work on
 

4761
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,590
problems to work on
that might matter if you sub if you

4762
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:19,600
that might matter if you sub if you
 

4763
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,950
that might matter if you sub if you
succeed

4764
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:20,960
succeed
 

4765
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:22,630
succeed
because that's why for example we dug

4766
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:22,640
because that's why for example we dug
 

4767
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:24,550

into cope it was just well
 

4769
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,310
into cope it was just well
suppose we succeed in finding some

4770
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:26,320
suppose we succeed in finding some
 

4771
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,669
suppose we succeed in finding some
interesting insight here

interesting insight here
 

4773
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:29,270
interesting insight here
well it actually matters then it's

4774
01:15:29,270 --> 01:15:29,280
well it actually matters then it's
 

4775
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,030
well it actually matters then it's
worthwhile

possibilities
 

4785
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:40,149
possibilities
one it might help with the covet or

4786
01:15:40,149 --> 01:15:40,159
one it might help with the covet or
 

4787
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:41,669
one it might help with the covet or
another pandemic

4788

another pandemic
 

4789
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:45,990
another pandemic
but two i mean just this whole

network theory space you might unlock

4792
01:15:49,830 --> 01:15:49,840
network theory space you might unlock
 

4793
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:51,510
network theory space you might unlock
some deep understanding about the

have
 

4799
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,149
have
nothing to do with the pandemic there's

4800
01:15:56,149 --> 01:15:56,159
nothing to do with the pandemic there's
 

4801
01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:58,310
nothing to do with the pandemic there's
a there's a space of possible impacts

4802
01:15:58,310 --> 01:15:58,320
a there's a space of possible impacts
 

4803
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,590
a there's a space of possible impacts
that may be direct or

that may be direct or
 

4805
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,149
that may be direct or
indirect and the same thing is like with

andrew wiles's proof
 

4809
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:06,870
andrew wiles's proof
i don't understand but apparently

4810
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:06,880
i don't understand but apparently

01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,430
i don't understand but apparently
the pieces of it are really impactful

4812
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:09,440
the pieces of it are really impactful
 

4813
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,870
the pieces of it are really impactful
for

4814
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:10,880
for

the key you've got to find good people
to learn things from yeah

4852
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:41,840
to learn things from yeah
 

4853
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,310
to learn things from yeah
but his thing was he often said you know

4854
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:44,320
but his thing was he often said you know
 

4855
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,910
but his thing was he often said you know
if you solve a math problem and have

math problem for him is like a proof
 

4861
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:49,830
math problem for him is like a proof
right so suppose you came up with this

4862
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:49,840
right so suppose you came up with this
 

4863
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:50,310
right so suppose you came up with this
proof

4864

proof
 

4865
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,790
proof
he always asks what have we learned from

4866
01:16:52,790 --> 01:16:52,800
he always asks what have we learned from
 

4867
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,709
he always asks what have we learned from
this that we could potentially use for

4868

something else
 

4871
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,910
something else
it's not just did you solve the problem

4872
01:16:57,910 --> 01:16:57,920
it's not just did you solve the problem
 

4873
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,270
it's not just did you solve the problem
that was supposed to be famous

4874
01:16:59,270 --> 01:16:59,280
that was supposed to be famous
 

4875
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,910
that was supposed to be famous
it was and is there something new in the

4876
01:17:01,910 --> 01:17:01,920
it was and is there something new in the
 

4877
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,189
it was and is there something new in the
course of solving this

4878
01:17:03,189 --> 01:17:03,199
course of solving this
 

4879
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:05,030
course of solving this
that you had to invent that we could now

4880
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:05,040
that you had to invent that we could now
 

4881
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,550
that you had to invent that we could now
use as a tool elsewhere

4882
01:17:06,550 --> 01:17:06,560
use as a tool elsewhere
 

4883
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:10,149
use as a tool elsewhere
you know there's this funny effect where

4884
01:17:10,149 --> 01:17:10,159
you know there's this funny effect where
 

4885
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:12,550
you know there's this funny effect where
uh just looking at different fields

4886
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:12,560
uh just looking at different fields
 

4887
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,870
uh just looking at different fields
where people discover parallels

4888
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:14,880
where people discover parallels
 

4889
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,470
where people discover parallels
they'll prove something it'll be a

4890
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:16,480
they'll prove something it'll be a
 

4891
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,149
they'll prove something it'll be a
totally new result and then somebody

4892
01:17:18,149 --> 01:17:18,159
totally new result and then somebody
 

4893
01:17:18,159 --> 01:17:20,070
totally new result and then somebody
later realizes this was already done 30

4894
01:17:20,070 --> 01:17:20,080
later realizes this was already done 30
 

4895
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,750
later realizes this was already done 30
years ago and another discipline

4896
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:21,760
years ago and another discipline
 

4897
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:24,070
years ago and another discipline
in another way and it's really

4898
01:17:24,070 --> 01:17:24,080
in another way and it's really
 

4899
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,310
in another way and it's really
interesting

4900
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:26,320
interesting
 

4901
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,229
interesting
uh we did this offline in another

01:17:28,229 --> 01:17:28,239
uh we did this offline in another
 

4903
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:30,149
uh we did this offline in another

01:17:32,229 --> 01:17:32,239
it's interesting to see the different
 

4907
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:33,830
it's interesting to see the different

perspectives
 

4909
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:37,510
perspectives
on a problem it kind of points like

01:17:37,510 --> 01:17:37,520
on a problem it kind of points like
 

4911
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,950
on a problem it kind of points like
there's just like very few novel ideas

4912
01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:40,960
there's just like very few novel ideas
 

4913
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,350
there's just like very few novel ideas
that everything else that most of us are

4914
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:43,360
that everything else that most of us are
 

4915
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,510
that everything else that most of us are
just looking at different perspective on

just looking at different perspective on
 

4917
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,110
just looking at different perspective on
the same idea

the same idea
 

4919
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,990
the same idea
and it makes you wonder this this uh

4920
01:17:49,990 --> 01:17:50,000
and it makes you wonder this this uh
 

4921
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,430
and it makes you wonder this this uh
this old silly question

4922
01:17:51,430 --> 01:17:51,440
this old silly question
 

4923
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,990
this old silly question
that i have to ask you is uh do you

01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:54,000
that i have to ask you is uh do you
 

4925
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:54,470
that i have to ask you is uh do you
think

4926
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:54,480
think
 

4927
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:58,070
think
mathematics is uh discovered or invented

4928
01:17:58,070 --> 01:17:58,080
mathematics is uh discovered or invented
 

4929
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:01,910
mathematics is uh discovered or invented
do you think we're creating

4930
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:01,920
do you think we're creating
 

4931
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,070
do you think we're creating
a new idea we're building a set of

4932
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:04,080
a new idea we're building a set of
 

4933
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,030
a new idea we're building a set of

that's that's distinct from reality

that's that's distinct from reality
 

4937
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:12,390
that's that's distinct from reality
or are we actually like it is math

4938
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:12,400
or are we actually like it is math
 

4939
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,229
or are we actually like it is math
almost like a shovel where we're digging

4940
01:18:14,229 --> 01:18:14,239
almost like a shovel where we're digging
 

4941
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:14,550

to

4942
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:14,560
to
 

4943
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:17,430
to
like this core set of truths that are oh

4944
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:17,440
like this core set of truths that are oh
 

4945
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:17,910
like this core set of truths that are oh
that

4946
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:17,920
that
 

4947
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:20,470
that
that were always there all along so i

4948
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:20,480
that were always there all along so i
 

4949
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:22,630
that were always there all along so i
personally feel like it's discovered

4950
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:22,640
personally feel like it's discovered
 

4951
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,630
personally feel like it's discovered
but that's also because i guess the way

4952
01:18:24,630 --> 01:18:24,640
but that's also because i guess the way
 

4953
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,630
but that's also because i guess the way
that i'd like to choose what questions

4954
01:18:26,630 --> 01:18:26,640
that i'd like to choose what questions
 

4955
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,270
that i'd like to choose what questions
to work on

4956
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:27,280
to work on
 

4957
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,189
to work on
are questions that maybe we'll get to

4958
01:18:29,189 --> 01:18:29,199
are questions that maybe we'll get to
 

4959
01:18:29,199 --> 01:18:31,110
are questions that maybe we'll get to
learn something about

4960
01:18:31,110 --> 01:18:31,120
learn something about
 

4961
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,870
learn something about
why is this hard i mean i'm often

4962
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:32,880
why is this hard i mean i'm often
 

4963
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,470
why is this hard i mean i'm often
attracted to questions that

4964
01:18:34,470 --> 01:18:34,480
attracted to questions that
 

4965
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:37,350
attracted to questions that
look simple but are hard right and what

4966
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:37,360
look simple but are hard right and what
 

4967
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:38,790
look simple but are hard right and what
could you possibly learn from that sort

4968
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:38,800
could you possibly learn from that sort
 

4969
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,229
could you possibly learn from that sort
of like probably the attraction of

4970
01:18:40,229 --> 01:18:40,239
of like probably the attraction of
 

4971
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:41,830
of like probably the attraction of
fermat's last theorem

4972
01:18:41,830 --> 01:18:41,840
fermat's last theorem
 

4973
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,830
fermat's last theorem
as you mentioned simple statement why is

4974
01:18:43,830 --> 01:18:43,840
as you mentioned simple statement why is
 

4975
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:46,070
as you mentioned simple statement why is
it so hard so i'm more on the

4976
01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:46,080
it so hard so i'm more on the
 

4977
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:48,630
it so hard so i'm more on the
discovered side and i also feel like if

4978
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:48,640
discovered side and i also feel like if
 

4979
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,630
discovered side and i also feel like if
we ever ran into an intelligent

4980
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:50,640
we ever ran into an intelligent
 

4981
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:54,709
we ever ran into an intelligent
other species in the universe

4982
01:18:54,709 --> 01:18:54,719
other species in the universe
 

4983
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:57,030
other species in the universe
probably if we compared notes there

4984
01:18:57,030 --> 01:18:57,040
probably if we compared notes there
 

4985
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:59,430
probably if we compared notes there
might be some similarities between

4986
01:18:59,430 --> 01:18:59,440
might be some similarities between
 

4987
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,110
might be some similarities between
both of us realizing that pi is

4988
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:01,120
both of us realizing that pi is
 

4989
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:02,790
both of us realizing that pi is
important because

4990
01:19:02,790 --> 01:19:02,800
important because
 

4991
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,709
important because
you might say why why humans do humans

01:19:04,709 --> 01:19:04,719
you might say why why humans do humans
 

4993
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:06,310
you might say why why humans do humans
like circles more than others i think

4994
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:06,320
like circles more than others i think
 

4995
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:08,950
like circles more than others i think
stars also like circles i think planets

4996
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:08,960
stars also like circles i think planets
 

4997
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,790
stars also like circles i think planets
like circles they're not perfect circles

4998
01:19:10,790 --> 01:19:10,800
like circles they're not perfect circles
 

4999
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,030
like circles they're not perfect circles
but nevertheless the concept of a circle

5000
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:13,040
but nevertheless the concept of a circle
 

5001
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,390
but nevertheless the concept of a circle
is just point and

5002
01:19:14,390 --> 01:19:14,400
is just point and
 

5003
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,070
is just point and
constant distance it doesn't get any

5004
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:16,080
constant distance it doesn't get any
 

5005
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,149
constant distance it doesn't get any
simpler than that it's possible that

5006
01:19:18,149 --> 01:19:18,159
simpler than that it's possible that
 

5007
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:21,030
simpler than that it's possible that
that like an alien species will have

5008
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:21,040
that like an alien species will have
 

5009
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,390
that like an alien species will have

01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:23,520
capabilities and
 

5013
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,110
capabilities and
different perception systems we'll be

5014
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:25,120
different perception systems we'll be
 

5015
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,750
different perception systems we'll be
able to see

5016
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:27,760

 

5017
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:29,110

things that are much different than

01:19:29,110 --> 01:19:29,120
things that are much different than
 

5019
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:32,470
things that are much different than
circles and so

5020
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:32,480
circles and so
 

5021
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,149
circles and so
if it's discovered it would still be

5022
01:19:34,149 --> 01:19:34,159
if it's discovered it would still be
 

5023
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:36,310
if it's discovered it would still be

mathematical concepts but
it's interesting to think of how many

it's interesting to think of how many

01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,550
it's interesting to think of how many

does that make sense to you and like
 

5101
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,510
does that make sense to you and like
can you mess with that concept to make

01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:21,840
yes i wonder how difficult that is uh
 

5129
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,510
yes i wonder how difficult that is uh
before one one or the other species

5130

i i hope that the curiosity for
 

5135
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:31,350
i i hope that the curiosity for
knowledge will overpower the greedy

5136

this is back to our game theory thing

5138
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:33,440
this is back to our game theory thing
 

5139
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,350
this is back to our game theory thing
that the curiosity of like

5140
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:35,360
that the curiosity of like
 

5141
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:37,990
that the curiosity of like
discovering math together will overpower

5142
01:21:37,990 --> 01:21:38,000
discovering math together will overpower
 

5143
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,990
discovering math together will overpower
the desire for resources

5144

the desire for resources
 

5145
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,110
the desire for resources
and uh ultimately like you know

5146
01:21:43,110 --> 01:21:43,120
and uh ultimately like you know
 

5147
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:44,709

willing to commit violence in order to
 

5149
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:46,310
willing to commit violence in order to
gain those resources

5150
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:46,320
gain those resources
 

5151
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,390
gain those resources
i think as we progress become more and

5152
01:21:48,390 --> 01:21:48,400
i think as we progress become more and
 

5153
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,229
i think as we progress become more and
more intelligence as a species i'm

5154
01:21:50,229 --> 01:21:50,239
more intelligence as a species i'm
 

5155
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:51,030
more intelligence as a species i'm
hoping

5156
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:51,040
hoping
 

5157
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,390
hoping
we would value more and more the

5158
01:21:52,390 --> 01:21:52,400
we would value more and more the
 

5159
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,149
we would value more and more the
knowledge because we'll come up with

5160
01:21:54,149 --> 01:21:54,159
knowledge because we'll come up with
 

5161
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:56,229
knowledge because we'll come up with
clever ways to gain more resources so we

5162
01:21:56,229 --> 01:21:56,239
clever ways to gain more resources so we
 

5163
01:21:56,239 --> 01:21:58,070
clever ways to gain more resources so we
won't be so resource starved

5164
01:21:58,070 --> 01:21:58,080
won't be so resource starved
 

5165
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,669
won't be so resource starved
i don't know that's a hopeful message

5166
01:21:59,669 --> 01:21:59,679
i don't know that's a hopeful message
 

5167
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:01,189
i don't know that's a hopeful message
from when we finally meet aliens

looking at a new problem that requires

5202
01:22:47,110 --> 01:22:47,120
looking at a new problem that requires
 

5203
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,149
looking at a new problem that requires
you to

5204
01:22:48,149 --> 01:22:48,159
you to
 

5205
01:22:48,159 --> 01:22:50,070
you to
detect that there's a symmetry of some

5206
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:50,080
detect that there's a symmetry of some
 

5207
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:51,430
detect that there's a symmetry of some
kind or

5208
01:22:51,430 --> 01:22:51,440
kind or
 

5209
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:54,390
kind or
there's a pattern that's that hasn't it

5210
01:22:54,390 --> 01:22:54,400
there's a pattern that's that hasn't it
 

5211
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:55,750
there's a pattern that's that hasn't it
hasn't seen before

5212
01:22:55,750 --> 01:22:55,760
hasn't seen before
 

5213
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:58,629
hasn't seen before
the pattern is like obvious to us humans

5214
01:22:58,629 --> 01:22:58,639
the pattern is like obvious to us humans
 

5215
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:00,470
the pattern is like obvious to us humans
but it's not so obvious to find that

5216
01:23:00,470 --> 01:23:00,480
but it's not so obvious to find that
 

5217
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,189
but it's not so obvious to find that
kind of

5218
01:23:01,189 --> 01:23:01,199
kind of
 

5219
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:03,669
kind of
it's you're inventing a pattern that's

5220
01:23:03,669 --> 01:23:03,679
it's you're inventing a pattern that's
 

5221
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:05,669
it's you're inventing a pattern that's
there

5222
01:23:05,669 --> 01:23:05,679
there
 

5223
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:11,270
there
in order to then find a solution

5224
01:23:11,270 --> 01:23:11,280

 

5225
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:14,070

some i don't know if you can comment on

some i don't know if you can comment on
 

5227
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:14,870
some i don't know if you can comment on
but from an

01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:14,880
but from an
 

5229
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:18,070
but from an
ai perspective and from a math problem

what do you think is intelligence what

01:23:22,149 --> 01:23:22,159
what do you think is intelligence what
 

5235
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:23,510
what do you think is intelligence what
do you think is the thing

5236
01:23:23,510 --> 01:23:23,520
do you think is the thing
 

5237
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,910
do you think is the thing
that allows us to solve that problem and

5238
01:23:25,910 --> 01:23:25,920
that allows us to solve that problem and
 

5239
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,629
that allows us to solve that problem and
how hard is it to build a machine

5240
01:23:28,629 --> 01:23:28,639
how hard is it to build a machine
 

5241
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:31,910
how hard is it to build a machine
to do that asking for a friend yeah so i

5242
01:23:31,910 --> 01:23:31,920
to do that asking for a friend yeah so i
 

5243
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:32,550
to do that asking for a friend yeah so i
guess

5244
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:32,560
guess
 

5245
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:33,910
guess
you see because if i just think of the

5246
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:33,920
you see because if i just think of the
 

5247
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,830
you see because if i just think of the
raw search space it's huge yeah

5248
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:35,840
raw search space it's huge yeah
 

5249
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,270
raw search space it's huge yeah
that's why you can't do it and if i

5250
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:37,280
that's why you can't do it and if i
 

5251
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:39,030
that's why you can't do it and if i
think about what makes somebody good at

5252
01:23:39,030 --> 01:23:39,040
think about what makes somebody good at
 

5253
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:41,110
think about what makes somebody good at
doing these things they have this

5254
01:23:41,110 --> 01:23:41,120
doing these things they have this
 

5255
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:42,870
doing these things they have this
heuristic sense it's almost like a good

5256
01:23:42,870 --> 01:23:42,880
heuristic sense it's almost like a good
 

5257
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,229
heuristic sense it's almost like a good
chess player of saying

5258
01:23:44,229 --> 01:23:44,239
chess player of saying
 

5259

let's not keep analyzing down this way

5260
01:23:45,910 --> 01:23:45,920
let's not keep analyzing down this way
 

5261
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,430
let's not keep analyzing down this way
because there's some heuristic reason

5262
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:47,440
because there's some heuristic reason
 

5263
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,110
because there's some heuristic reason
why that's a bad way to go yes

5264
01:23:49,110 --> 01:23:49,120
why that's a bad way to go yes
 

5265
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,390
why that's a bad way to go yes
where did they get that heuristic from

5266
01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:50,400
where did they get that heuristic from
 

5267
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,950
where did they get that heuristic from
now that's a good question i don't know

5268
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:52,960
now that's a good question i don't know
 

5269
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,270
now that's a good question i don't know
because that if you asked them to

5270
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:55,280
because that if you asked them to
 

5271
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,550
because that if you asked them to
explain to you

5272
01:23:56,550 --> 01:23:56,560
explain to you
 

5273
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:57,830
explain to you
they could probably say something in

5274
01:23:57,830 --> 01:23:57,840
they could probably say something in
 

5275
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,350
they could probably say something in
words that sounds like it makes sense

5276
01:23:59,350 --> 01:23:59,360
words that sounds like it makes sense
 

5277
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,110
words that sounds like it makes sense
yeah but i'm guessing that's only a part

5278
01:24:01,110 --> 01:24:01,120
yeah but i'm guessing that's only a part
 

5279
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:01,990
yeah but i'm guessing that's only a part
of what's really going

5280
01:24:01,990 --> 01:24:02,000
of what's really going
 

5281
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,830
of what's really going
on in their brain of evaluating that

5282
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:03,840
on in their brain of evaluating that
 

5283
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,510
on in their brain of evaluating that
position you know what i mean if you ask

5284
01:24:05,510 --> 01:24:05,520
position you know what i mean if you ask
 

5285
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:07,110
position you know what i mean if you ask
gary kasparov what is good or

5286
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:07,120
gary kasparov what is good or
 

5287
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,950
gary kasparov what is good or
why is this position good he will say

5288
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:08,960
why is this position good he will say
 

5289
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:11,270
why is this position good he will say
something yeah but it's probably not

5290
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:11,280
something yeah but it's probably not
 

5291
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:13,110
something yeah but it's probably not
approximating everything that's going on

5292
01:24:13,110 --> 01:24:13,120
approximating everything that's going on
 

5293
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:13,830
approximating everything that's going on
inside

5294
01:24:13,830 --> 01:24:13,840
inside
 

5295
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,350
inside
so there's basically a function being

5296
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:15,360
so there's basically a function being
 

5297
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,510
so there's basically a function being
computed yeah but it's hard to

5298
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:17,520
computed yeah but it's hard to
 

5299
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,030
computed yeah but it's hard to
articulate what that function is

5300
01:24:19,030 --> 01:24:19,040
articulate what that function is
 

5301
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:21,189
articulate what that function is
now the question is could a computer get

5302
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:21,199
now the question is could a computer get
 

5303
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:22,709
now the question is could a computer get
as good at computing these kinds of

5304
01:24:22,709 --> 01:24:22,719
as good at computing these kinds of
 

5305
01:24:22,719 --> 01:24:24,149
as good at computing these kinds of
heuristic functions

5306
01:24:24,149 --> 01:24:24,159
heuristic functions
 

5307
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:26,790
heuristic functions
maybe i i'm not enough of an expert to

5308
01:24:26,790 --> 01:24:26,800
maybe i i'm not enough of an expert to
 

5309
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:27,750
maybe i i'm not enough of an expert to
understand

5310
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:27,760
understand
 

5311
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:29,189
understand
but one bit of me has always been a

01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:29,199
but one bit of me has always been a
 

5313
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:31,189
but one bit of me has always been a
little bit curious of whether or not the

5314
01:24:31,189 --> 01:24:31,199
little bit curious of whether or not the
 

5315
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:32,070
little bit curious of whether or not the

5323
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:39,430
things
which is just natural due to the way

01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:39,440
which is just natural due to the way

01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:40,470
which is just natural due to the way

there for which if you tried to just

01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:47,189
there for which if you tried to just

build from scratch a computer to do it
 

5333
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:48,550
build from scratch a computer to do it
would it naturally have different

5337
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,270

i don't know and this is just me being

i don't know and this is just me being
 

5339

i don't know and this is just me being
completely ignorant and just saying a

few ideas
 

5343
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,030
few ideas
well this is a good thing with that

5344
01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:55,040
well this is a good thing with that
 

5345
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,669
well this is a good thing with that
mathematics shows is we don't have to be

so math and physics or mathematical

physics
operates in a world that's different

operates in a world that's different
 

5353
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,229
operates in a world that's different
than our

descendant of a brains operate in
 

5357
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:10,470
descendant of a brains operate in
so it allows us to to have multiple

so it allows us to to have multiple
 

5359
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,629
so it allows us to to have multiple
many many dimensions it allows us to

many many dimensions it allows us to
 

5361
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:15,430
many many dimensions it allows us to
work on on weird surfaces

5362
01:25:15,430 --> 01:25:15,440
work on on weird surfaces
 

5363
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:18,550
work on on weird surfaces
uh with like topology as a discipline

5364
01:25:18,550 --> 01:25:18,560
uh with like topology as a discipline
 

5365
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:19,910
uh with like topology as a discipline
it's just weird to me

5366
01:25:19,910 --> 01:25:19,920
it's just weird to me
 

5367
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:21,750
it's just weird to me
it's really complicated but it allows us

5368
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:21,760
it's really complicated but it allows us
 

5369
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,590
it's really complicated but it allows us
to work in that space

5370
01:25:23,590 --> 01:25:23,600
to work in that space
 

5371
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,189
to work in that space
the differential geometry and all those

5372
01:25:25,189 --> 01:25:25,199
the differential geometry and all those
 

5373
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:26,629
the differential geometry and all those
kinds of things where

5374
01:25:26,629 --> 01:25:26,639
kinds of things where
 

5375
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:29,910
kinds of things where
it's totally outside of our natural

5376
01:25:29,910 --> 01:25:29,920
it's totally outside of our natural
 

5377
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:30,629
it's totally outside of our natural
day-to-day

5378
01:25:30,629 --> 01:25:30,639
day-to-day
 

5379
01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:33,669
day-to-day
four-dimensional experience uh 3d

5380
01:25:33,669 --> 01:25:33,679
four-dimensional experience uh 3d
 

5381
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:34,790
four-dimensional experience uh 3d
dimensional with time

5382
01:25:34,790 --> 01:25:34,800
dimensional with time
 

5383
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:37,750
dimensional with time
experience so math gives us gives me

5384
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:37,760
experience so math gives us gives me
 

5385
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:38,310
experience so math gives us gives me
hope

5386
01:25:38,310 --> 01:25:38,320
hope
 

5387
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:41,350
hope
that we can that

5388
01:25:41,350 --> 01:25:41,360
that we can that
 

5389
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:45,030
that we can that
we can see we can discover the processes

5390
01:25:45,030 --> 01:25:45,040
we can see we can discover the processes
 

5391
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,709
we can see we can discover the processes
of intelligence

5392
01:25:46,709 --> 01:25:46,719
of intelligence
 

5393
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:50,149
of intelligence
uh outside the limited nature of our own

5394
01:25:50,149 --> 01:25:50,159
uh outside the limited nature of our own
 

5395
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:51,910
uh outside the limited nature of our own
like human experiences

5396
01:25:51,910 --> 01:25:51,920
like human experiences
 

5397
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:55,910
like human experiences
but you said that you're not an expert

5398
01:25:55,910 --> 01:25:55,920
but you said that you're not an expert
 

5399
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:59,510
but you said that you're not an expert
it's kind of funny i i i find that um

5400
01:25:59,510 --> 01:25:59,520
it's kind of funny i i i find that um
 

5401
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:02,629
it's kind of funny i i i find that um
we know so little about intelligence

5402
01:26:02,629 --> 01:26:02,639
we know so little about intelligence
 

5403
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:05,830
we know so little about intelligence
that uh i think i honestly think like

5404
01:26:05,830 --> 01:26:05,840
that uh i think i honestly think like
 

5405
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:06,229
that uh i think i honestly think like
almost

5406
01:26:06,229 --> 01:26:06,239
almost
 

5407
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:09,350
almost
children are more expert at

5408
01:26:09,350 --> 01:26:09,360
children are more expert at
 

5409
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:12,149
children are more expert at
creating artificial intelligence systems

5410
01:26:12,149 --> 01:26:12,159
creating artificial intelligence systems
 

5411
01:26:12,159 --> 01:26:12,550

exams
but even just solving math problems

5426
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:27,760
but even just solving math problems
 

5427
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:29,750
but even just solving math problems
i don't know if you've ever done this

5428
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:29,760
i don't know if you've ever done this
 

5429
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,510
i don't know if you've ever done this
for yourself but

5430
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:31,520
for yourself but
 

5431
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,750
for yourself but
when you solve a math problem you kind

5432
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:33,760
when you solve a math problem you kind
 

5433
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:35,189
when you solve a math problem you kind
of then

5434
01:26:35,189 --> 01:26:35,199
of then
 

5435
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:38,070
of then
traced back and tried to figure out

5436
01:26:38,070 --> 01:26:38,080
traced back and tried to figure out
 

5437
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:40,390
traced back and tried to figure out
where did that idea come from

5438
01:26:40,390 --> 01:26:40,400
where did that idea come from
 

5439
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:43,430
where did that idea come from
like what how did like what was i

5440
01:26:43,430 --> 01:26:43,440
like what how did like what was i
 

5441
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:45,189
like what how did like what was i
visualizing in my head

5442
01:26:45,189 --> 01:26:45,199
visualizing in my head
 

5443
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:48,310
visualizing in my head
how did i start visualizing it that way

5444
01:26:48,310 --> 01:26:48,320
how did i start visualizing it that way
 

5445
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,470
how did i start visualizing it that way
how why did i start rotating that cube

5446
01:26:50,470 --> 01:26:50,480
how why did i start rotating that cube
 

5447
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,149
how why did i start rotating that cube
in my head in that way

5448
01:26:52,149 --> 01:26:52,159
in my head in that way
 

5449
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:53,830
in my head in that way
like what is that if i were to try to

5450
01:26:53,830 --> 01:26:53,840
like what is that if i were to try to
 

5451
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,590
like what is that if i were to try to
build a program that does that

5452
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:55,600
build a program that does that
 

5453
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,350
build a program that does that
where that come from so this is

5454
01:26:57,350 --> 01:26:57,360
where that come from so this is
 

5455
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:58,950
where that come from so this is
interesting um

5456
01:26:58,950 --> 01:26:58,960
interesting um
 

5457
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:01,669
interesting um
so i try to do this to teach middle

5458
01:27:01,669 --> 01:27:01,679
so i try to do this to teach middle
 

5459
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:02,629
so i try to do this to teach middle
school students

5460
01:27:02,629 --> 01:27:02,639
school students
 

5461
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:04,390
school students
how to learn how to create create and

5462
01:27:04,390 --> 01:27:04,400
how to learn how to create create and
 

5463
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,709
how to learn how to create create and
think and invent and the way i do it

5464
01:27:06,709 --> 01:27:06,719
think and invent and the way i do it
 

5465
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:08,149
think and invent and the way i do it
is there are these math competition

5466
01:27:08,149 --> 01:27:08,159
is there are these math competition
 

5467
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:09,750
is there are these math competition
problems and i'm working in

5468
01:27:09,750 --> 01:27:09,760
problems and i'm working in
 

5469
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,350
problems and i'm working in
collaboration with the people who run

5470
01:27:11,350 --> 01:27:11,360
collaboration with the people who run
 

5471
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:11,910
collaboration with the people who run
those

5472
01:27:11,910 --> 01:27:11,920
those
 

5473
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:14,149
those
and i will turn on my youtube live and

5474
01:27:14,149 --> 01:27:14,159
and i will turn on my youtube live and
 

5475
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:15,590
and i will turn on my youtube live and
for the first time look at those

5476
01:27:15,590 --> 01:27:15,600
for the first time look at those
 

5477
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:16,310
for the first time look at those
questions

5478
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:16,320
questions
 

5479
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:19,430
questions
and live solve them the reason i do this

5480
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:19,440
and live solve them the reason i do this
 

5481
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:21,189
and live solve them the reason i do this
is to let the middle school students and

5482
01:27:21,189 --> 01:27:21,199
is to let the middle school students and
 

5483
01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:22,310
is to let the middle school students and
the high school students and the adults

5484
01:27:22,310 --> 01:27:22,320
the high school students and the adults
 

5485
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:23,350
the high school students and the adults
whoever wants to watch

5486
01:27:23,350 --> 01:27:23,360
whoever wants to watch
 

5487
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,910
whoever wants to watch
just see what exactly goes on through

5488
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:25,920
just see what exactly goes on through
 

5489
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,350
just see what exactly goes on through
someone's head

5490
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:27,360
someone's head
 

5491
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:29,430
someone's head
as they go and attempt to invent what

5492
01:27:29,430 --> 01:27:29,440
as they go and attempt to invent what
 

5493
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:31,990
as they go and attempt to invent what
they need to do to solve the question

5494
01:27:31,990 --> 01:27:32,000
they need to do to solve the question
 

5495
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,550
they need to do to solve the question
so i've actually thought about that i

5496
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:34,560
so i've actually thought about that i
 

5497
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:35,590
so i've actually thought about that i
think that

5498
01:27:35,590 --> 01:27:35,600
think that
 

5499
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,149
think that
first of all as a teacher i think about

5500
01:27:38,149 --> 01:27:38,159
first of all as a teacher i think about
 

5501
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:39,830
first of all as a teacher i think about
that because whenever i want to explain

5502
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:39,840
that because whenever i want to explain
 

5503
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:41,910
that because whenever i want to explain
to a student how to do something

5504
01:27:41,910 --> 01:27:41,920
to a student how to do something
 

5505
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,229
to a student how to do something
i want to explain how it made sense why

5506
01:27:44,229 --> 01:27:44,239
i want to explain how it made sense why
 

5507
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:45,669
i want to explain how it made sense why
it's intuitive to do the following

5508
01:27:45,669 --> 01:27:45,679
it's intuitive to do the following
 

5509
01:27:45,679 --> 01:27:46,070
it's intuitive to do the following
things

5510
01:27:46,070 --> 01:27:46,080
things
 

5511
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:48,950
things
and why the wrong things are wrong not

5512
01:27:48,950 --> 01:27:48,960
and why the wrong things are wrong not
 

5513
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:51,750
and why the wrong things are wrong not
just by this one short fast way

5514
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:51,760
just by this one short fast way
 

5515
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:53,830
just by this one short fast way
well why this is the right way if that

5516
01:27:53,830 --> 01:27:53,840
well why this is the right way if that
 

5517
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,590
well why this is the right way if that
makes sense so my point is i'm actually

5518
01:27:55,590 --> 01:27:55,600
makes sense so my point is i'm actually
 

5519
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,110
makes sense so my point is i'm actually
always thinking about that

5520
01:27:57,110 --> 01:27:57,120
always thinking about that
 

5521
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:58,470
always thinking about that
like how would you think about these

5522
01:27:58,470 --> 01:27:58,480
like how would you think about these
 

5523
01:27:58,480 --> 01:27:59,990
like how would you think about these
things and then i eventually decided the

5524
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:00,000
things and then i eventually decided the
 

5525
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,590
things and then i eventually decided the
easiest way to expose this

5526
01:28:01,590 --> 01:28:01,600
easiest way to expose this
 

5527
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:04,629
easiest way to expose this
would just be to go live on youtube and

5528
01:28:04,629 --> 01:28:04,639
would just be to go live on youtube and
 

5529
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:05,910
would just be to go live on youtube and
just say i've never seen any of these

5530
01:28:05,910 --> 01:28:05,920
just say i've never seen any of these
 

5531
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,750
just say i've never seen any of these
questions before here we go

5532
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:07,760
questions before here we go
 

5533
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:10,310
questions before here we go
don't you get uh man that's that's

5534
01:28:10,310 --> 01:28:10,320
don't you get uh man that's that's
 

5535
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,070
don't you get uh man that's that's
anxiety inducing for me

5536
01:28:12,070 --> 01:28:12,080
anxiety inducing for me
 

5537
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:15,189
anxiety inducing for me
uh don't you get trapped in

5538
01:28:15,189 --> 01:28:15,199
uh don't you get trapped in
 

5539
01:28:15,199 --> 01:28:17,350
uh don't you get trapped in
a kind of like little dead ends of

5540
01:28:17,350 --> 01:28:17,360
a kind of like little dead ends of
 

5541
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:18,629
a kind of like little dead ends of
confusion

5542
01:28:18,629 --> 01:28:18,639
confusion
 

5543
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:20,470
confusion
even on middle school problems yes

5544
01:28:20,470 --> 01:28:20,480
even on middle school problems yes
 

5545
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,830
even on middle school problems yes
that's what the comments are for

5546
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:21,840
that's what the comments are for
 

5547
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:23,270
that's what the comments are for
the live contents come in and students

5548
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:23,280
the live contents come in and students
 

5549
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:25,510
the live contents come in and students
say try this oh wow

5550
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:25,520
say try this oh wow
 

5551
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:27,270
say try this oh wow
it's actually pretty good i'll never get

5552
01:28:27,270 --> 01:28:27,280
it's actually pretty good i'll never get
 

5553
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:29,270
it's actually pretty good i'll never get
stuck i mean i'm i'm willing to go on

5554
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:29,280
stuck i mean i'm i'm willing to go on
 

5555
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:30,310
stuck i mean i'm i'm willing to go on
camera and say

5556
01:28:30,310 --> 01:28:30,320
camera and say
 

5557
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:32,149
camera and say
guess what potion though can't do this

5558
01:28:32,149 --> 01:28:32,159
guess what potion though can't do this
 

5559
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:34,070
guess what potion though can't do this
that's fine but then what ends up

5560
01:28:34,070 --> 01:28:34,080
that's fine but then what ends up
 

5561
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:34,629
that's fine but then what ends up
happening

5562
01:28:34,629 --> 01:28:34,639
happening
 

5563
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:36,310
happening
is you will then see how maybe

5564
01:28:36,310 --> 01:28:36,320
is you will then see how maybe
 

5565
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:37,510
is you will then see how maybe
somebody's saying something and i look

5566
01:28:37,510 --> 01:28:37,520
somebody's saying something and i look
 

5567
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:39,270
somebody's saying something and i look
at the chat and i say aha

5568
01:28:39,270 --> 01:28:39,280
at the chat and i say aha
 

5569
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:41,189
at the chat and i say aha
that actually looks useful now that also

5570
01:28:41,189 --> 01:28:41,199
that actually looks useful now that also
 

5571
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:42,950
that actually looks useful now that also
shows how

5572
01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:42,960
shows how
 

5573
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,950
shows how
not all ideas not all suggestions are

5574
01:28:44,950 --> 01:28:44,960
not all ideas not all suggestions are
 

5575
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:46,229
not all ideas not all suggestions are
the same power

5576
01:28:46,229 --> 01:28:46,239
the same power
 

5577
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:47,270
the same power
if that makes sense because if i

5578
01:28:47,270 --> 01:28:47,280
if that makes sense because if i
 

5579
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:48,629
if that makes sense because if i
actually do get stuck i'll go fishing

5580
01:28:48,629 --> 01:28:48,639
actually do get stuck i'll go fishing
 

5581
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:49,390
actually do get stuck i'll go fishing

i don't know if you can speak to this

5586
01:28:53,270 --> 01:28:53,280
i don't know if you can speak to this
 

5587
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:55,350
i don't know if you can speak to this
but is there a moment

5588
01:28:55,350 --> 01:28:55,360
but is there a moment
 

5589
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:57,590
but is there a moment
for the middle school students maybe

5590
01:28:57,590 --> 01:28:57,600
for the middle school students maybe
 

5591
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,750
for the middle school students maybe
high school as well

5592
01:28:59,750 --> 01:28:59,760
high school as well
 

5593
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:03,270
high school as well
where there's like a turning point for

5594
01:29:03,270 --> 01:29:03,280
where there's like a turning point for
 

5595
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:04,310
where there's like a turning point for
them

5596
01:29:04,310 --> 01:29:04,320
them
 

5597
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,629
them
where they maybe fall in love with

5598
01:29:06,629 --> 01:29:06,639
where they maybe fall in love with
 

5599
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:07,750
where they maybe fall in love with
mathematics

5600
01:29:07,750 --> 01:29:07,760
mathematics
 

5601
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:11,030
mathematics
or they or they get it is there um

5602
01:29:11,030 --> 01:29:11,040
or they or they get it is there um
 

5603
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:12,790
or they or they get it is there um
is there something to be said about like

5604
01:29:12,790 --> 01:29:12,800
is there something to be said about like
 

5605
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,629
is there something to be said about like
discovering that moment and

5606
01:29:14,629 --> 01:29:14,639
discovering that moment and
 

5607
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:17,350
discovering that moment and
and trying to grab them to get to get

5608
01:29:17,350 --> 01:29:17,360
and trying to grab them to get to get
 

5609
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:17,910
and trying to grab them to get to get
them to

5610
01:29:17,910 --> 01:29:17,920
them to
 

5611
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:20,229
them to
understand that mathematics is so no

5612
01:29:20,229 --> 01:29:20,239
understand that mathematics is so no
 

5613
01:29:20,239 --> 01:29:21,510
understand that mathematics is so no
matter what they want to do in life

5614
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:21,520
matter what they want to do in life
 

5615
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:23,030
matter what they want to do in life
could be part of their life

5616
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:23,040
could be part of their life
 

5617
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:25,189
could be part of their life
yes i actually do think that the middle

5618
01:29:25,189 --> 01:29:25,199
yes i actually do think that the middle
 

5619
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:26,790
yes i actually do think that the middle
school is exactly the right time

5620
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:26,800
school is exactly the right time
 

5621
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:28,390
school is exactly the right time
because that's the place where your

5622
01:29:28,390 --> 01:29:28,400
because that's the place where your
 

5623
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,390
because that's the place where your
mathematical understanding

5624
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:30,400
mathematical understanding
 

5625
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,709
mathematical understanding
gets just sophisticated enough that you

5626
01:29:32,709 --> 01:29:32,719
gets just sophisticated enough that you
 

5627
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:34,550
gets just sophisticated enough that you
can start doing interesting things

5628
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:34,560
can start doing interesting things
 

5629
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:37,590
can start doing interesting things
because if you're early on in counting

5630
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:37,600
because if you're early on in counting
 

5631
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,270
because if you're early on in counting
i'm honestly not very good at teaching

01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:39,280
i'm honestly not very good at teaching
 

5633
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:40,629

you new insights

5634
01:29:40,629 --> 01:29:40,639
you new insights

my wife is pretty good at that but

5636
01:29:42,229 --> 01:29:42,239
my wife is pretty good at that but
 

5637
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:43,669
my wife is pretty good at that but
somehow once you get to this

5638
01:29:43,669 --> 01:29:43,679
somehow once you get to this
 

5639
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:45,189
somehow once you get to this
this part where you know what a fraction

5640
01:29:45,189 --> 01:29:45,199
this part where you know what a fraction
 

5641
01:29:45,199 --> 01:29:46,950
this part where you know what a fraction
is and when you know

5642
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:46,960
is and when you know
 

5643
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:49,590
is and when you know
um how to add and how to multiply and

5644
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:49,600
um how to add and how to multiply and
 

5645
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,189
um how to add and how to multiply and
what the area of a triangle is

5646
01:29:51,189 --> 01:29:51,199
what the area of a triangle is
 

5647
01:29:51,199 --> 01:29:53,430
what the area of a triangle is
at that point to me the whole world

5648
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:53,440
at that point to me the whole world
 

5649
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,110
at that point to me the whole world
opens up and you can start observing

5650
01:29:55,110 --> 01:29:55,120
opens up and you can start observing
 

5651
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:57,270
opens up and you can start observing
there are really nifty coincidences

5652
01:29:57,270 --> 01:29:57,280
there are really nifty coincidences
 

5653
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:58,950
there are really nifty coincidences
the things that made the greek

5654

actually back then it was exciting to

5660
01:30:03,910 --> 01:30:03,920
actually back then it was exciting to
 

5661
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:05,590
actually back then it was exciting to
discover the pythagorean theorem

5662
01:30:05,590 --> 01:30:05,600
discover the pythagorean theorem
 

5663
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:09,910
discover the pythagorean theorem
it wasn't just homework so is there

5664
01:30:09,910 --> 01:30:09,920
it wasn't just homework so is there
 

5665
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:11,990
it wasn't just homework so is there
what which discipline do you think has

5666
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:12,000
what which discipline do you think has

what which discipline do you think has
the most exciting coincidences so

5668
01:30:14,950 --> 01:30:14,960
the most exciting coincidences so
 

5669
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:18,870
the most exciting coincidences so
is it geometry is it algebra

5670
01:30:18,870 --> 01:30:18,880
is it geometry is it algebra
 

5671
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:22,070
is it geometry is it algebra
um is it calculus well you see you're

5672
01:30:22,070 --> 01:30:22,080
um is it calculus well you see you're
 

5673
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,590
um is it calculus well you see you're
asking me and i'm the guy who gets the

5674
01:30:23,590 --> 01:30:23,600
asking me and i'm the guy who gets the
 

5675
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:24,470
asking me and i'm the guy who gets the
most excited

5676

most excited
 

5677
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:26,550
most excited
when the combinatorics shows up in the

5678
01:30:26,550 --> 01:30:26,560
when the combinatorics shows up in the
 

5679
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,390

is it okay so it's the combinatorics

5682
01:30:31,990 --> 01:30:32,000
is it okay so it's the combinatorics
 

5683
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,830
is it okay so it's the combinatorics
in the geometry so first of all the nice

5684
01:30:33,830 --> 01:30:33,840
in the geometry so first of all the nice
 

5685
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:35,110
in the geometry so first of all the nice
thing about geometry

5686
01:30:35,110 --> 01:30:35,120
thing about geometry
 

5687
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:36,629
thing about geometry
this is the same nice thing about

5688
01:30:36,629 --> 01:30:36,639
this is the same nice thing about
 

5689
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:38,470
this is the same nice thing about
computer vision is it's

5690
01:30:38,470 --> 01:30:38,480
computer vision is it's
 

5691
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:41,590
computer vision is it's
visual so geometry you can draw circles

5692
01:30:41,590 --> 01:30:41,600
visual so geometry you can draw circles
 

5693
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,189
visual so geometry you can draw circles
and triangles and stuff so

5694
01:30:43,189 --> 01:30:43,199
and triangles and stuff so
 

5695
01:30:43,199 --> 01:30:47,270
and triangles and stuff so
it naturally uh presents itself to uh

5696
01:30:47,270 --> 01:30:47,280
it naturally uh presents itself to uh
 

5697
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:49,830
it naturally uh presents itself to uh
to the visual proof right but also the

5698
01:30:49,830 --> 01:30:49,840
to the visual proof right but also the
 

5699
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:51,830
to the visual proof right but also the
nice thing about geometry i think

5700
01:30:51,830 --> 01:30:51,840
nice thing about geometry i think
 

5701
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:55,750
nice thing about geometry i think
for me is the earliest

5702
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:55,760
for me is the earliest
 

5703
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:58,390
for me is the earliest
class the earliest discipline where

5704
01:30:58,390 --> 01:30:58,400
class the earliest discipline where
 

5705
01:30:58,400 --> 01:30:58,870
class the earliest discipline where
there's

5706
01:30:58,870 --> 01:30:58,880
there's
 

5707
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:01,030
there's
uh that's most amenable to the

5708
01:31:01,030 --> 01:31:01,040
uh that's most amenable to the
 

5709
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:02,310
uh that's most amenable to the
exploration

5710
01:31:02,310 --> 01:31:02,320
exploration
 

5711
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:05,270
exploration
of the invention through proofs the idea

5712
01:31:05,270 --> 01:31:05,280
of the invention through proofs the idea
 

5713
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:07,510
of the invention through proofs the idea
of proofs i think is most easily

5714
01:31:07,510 --> 01:31:07,520
of proofs i think is most easily
 

5715
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:10,070
of proofs i think is most easily
shown in in geometry because it's so

5716
01:31:10,070 --> 01:31:10,080
shown in in geometry because it's so
 

5717
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:12,229
shown in in geometry because it's so
visual i guess

5718
01:31:12,229 --> 01:31:12,239
visual i guess
 

5719
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:14,709
visual i guess
so that that to me is like uh if i were

5720
01:31:14,709 --> 01:31:14,719
so that that to me is like uh if i were
 

5721
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:15,990
so that that to me is like uh if i were
to think about when i first

5722
01:31:15,990 --> 01:31:16,000
to think about when i first
 

5723
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,189
to think about when i first
fell in love with math it would be

5724
01:31:17,189 --> 01:31:17,199
fell in love with math it would be
 

5725
01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:20,149
fell in love with math it would be
geometry and sadly enough

5726
01:31:20,149 --> 01:31:20,159
geometry and sadly enough
 

5727
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:22,390
geometry and sadly enough
that's not used geometry only has a

5728
01:31:22,390 --> 01:31:22,400
that's not used geometry only has a
 

5729
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:24,950
that's not used geometry only has a
little appears briefly

5730
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:24,960
little appears briefly
 

5731
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:28,870
little appears briefly
in the journey of of an um of a student

5732
01:31:28,870 --> 01:31:28,880
in the journey of of an um of a student
 

5733
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:31,430
in the journey of of an um of a student
and it kind of disappears and not until

5734
01:31:31,430 --> 01:31:31,440
and it kind of disappears and not until
 

5735
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:33,590
and it kind of disappears and not until
much later which

5736
01:31:33,590 --> 01:31:33,600
much later which
 

5737
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,910
much later which
you know to maybe like differential

5738
01:31:35,910 --> 01:31:35,920
you know to maybe like differential
 

5739
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:37,189
you know to maybe like differential
geometry i don't know where else it

5740
01:31:37,189 --> 01:31:37,199
geometry i don't know where else it
 

5741
01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:39,590
geometry i don't know where else it
shows up for me in computer science like

5742
01:31:39,590 --> 01:31:39,600
shows up for me in computer science like
 

5743
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:42,149
shows up for me in computer science like
you can start to think about like

5744
01:31:42,149 --> 01:31:42,159
you can start to think about like
 

5745
01:31:42,159 --> 01:31:44,149
you can start to think about like
computational geometry or even graph

5746
01:31:44,149 --> 01:31:44,159
computational geometry or even graph
 

5747
01:31:44,159 --> 01:31:45,669
computational geometry or even graph
theory is the kind of geometry you can

5748
01:31:45,669 --> 01:31:45,679
theory is the kind of geometry you can
 

5749
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:47,110
theory is the kind of geometry you can
start to think about it visually

5750
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:47,120
start to think about it visually
 

5751
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:49,830
start to think about it visually
although it's pretty tricky but yeah it

5752
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:49,840
although it's pretty tricky but yeah it
 

5753
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:50,950
although it's pretty tricky but yeah it
was always um

5754
01:31:50,950 --> 01:31:50,960
was always um
 

5755
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:52,870
was always um
that that was the most beautiful one

5756
01:31:52,870 --> 01:31:52,880
that that was the most beautiful one
 

5757
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,870
that that was the most beautiful one
everything else i guess calculus can be

5758
01:31:54,870 --> 01:31:54,880
everything else i guess calculus can be
 

5759
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:56,390
everything else i guess calculus can be
kind of visual too that can that could

5760
01:31:56,390 --> 01:31:56,400
kind of visual too that can that could
 

5761
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:57,669
kind of visual too that can that could
be pretty beautiful

5762
01:31:57,669 --> 01:31:57,679
be pretty beautiful
 

5763
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:01,510
be pretty beautiful
but is there um something

5764
01:32:01,510 --> 01:32:01,520
but is there um something
 

5765
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:05,270
but is there um something
you try to look for in the student

5766
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:05,280
you try to look for in the student
 

5767
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:08,550
you try to look for in the student
to see like how can i inspire them at

5768
01:32:08,550 --> 01:32:08,560
to see like how can i inspire them at
 

5769
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:09,750
to see like how can i inspire them at
this moment

5770
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:09,760
this moment
 

5771
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:11,350
this moment
or is this like individual student to

5772
01:32:11,350 --> 01:32:11,360
or is this like individual student to
 

5773
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,270
or is this like individual student to
student is there something you could say

5774
01:32:13,270 --> 01:32:13,280
student is there something you could say
 

5775
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:13,750
student is there something you could say
there

5776
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:13,760
there
 

5777
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:15,270
there
so first of all i really think that

5778
01:32:15,270 --> 01:32:15,280
so first of all i really think that
 

5779
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:17,270
so first of all i really think that
every student can pick up all of this

5780
01:32:17,270 --> 01:32:17,280
every student can pick up all of this
 

5781
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:17,750
every student can pick up all of this
skill

5782
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:17,760
skill
 

5783
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:19,110
skill
i really do think so i don't think it's

5784
01:32:19,110 --> 01:32:19,120
i really do think so i don't think it's
 

5785
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:21,189
i really do think so i don't think it's
something only for a few and so

5786
01:32:21,189 --> 01:32:21,199
something only for a few and so
 

5787
01:32:21,199 --> 01:32:23,910
something only for a few and so
if i'm looking for a student actually

5788
01:32:23,910 --> 01:32:23,920
if i'm looking for a student actually
 

5789
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:24,950
if i'm looking for a student actually
oftentimes when i'm

5790
01:32:24,950 --> 01:32:24,960
oftentimes when i'm
 

5791
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,709
oftentimes when i'm
if i'm looking at a particular student

5792
01:32:26,709 --> 01:32:26,719
if i'm looking at a particular student
 

5793
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:28,390
if i'm looking at a particular student
the question is

5794
01:32:28,390 --> 01:32:28,400
the question is
 

5795
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,790
the question is
how can we help you feel like you have

5796
01:32:30,790 --> 01:32:30,800
how can we help you feel like you have
 

5797
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:32,870
how can we help you feel like you have
the power to invent also

5798
01:32:32,870 --> 01:32:32,880
the power to invent also
 

5799
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:34,470
the power to invent also
because i think a lot of people are used

5800
01:32:34,470 --> 01:32:34,480
because i think a lot of people are used
 

5801
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:35,910
because i think a lot of people are used
to thinking about math as something

5802
01:32:35,910 --> 01:32:35,920
to thinking about math as something
 

5803
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:37,430
to thinking about math as something
where the teacher will show you what to

5804
01:32:37,430 --> 01:32:37,440
where the teacher will show you what to
 

5805
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:37,830
where the teacher will show you what to
do

5806
01:32:37,830 --> 01:32:37,840
do
 

5807
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,910
do
and then you will do it yes so i think

5808
01:32:39,910 --> 01:32:39,920
and then you will do it yes so i think
 

5809
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:41,110
and then you will do it yes so i think
that the key is to

5810
01:32:41,110 --> 01:32:41,120
that the key is to
 

5811
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:42,550
that the key is to
show that they have some let them see

5812
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:42,560
show that they have some let them see
 

5813
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:44,149
show that they have some let them see
that they have some power to invent

5814
01:32:44,149 --> 01:32:44,159
that they have some power to invent
 

5815
01:32:44,159 --> 01:32:46,629
that they have some power to invent
and at that point it's often starting by

5816
01:32:46,629 --> 01:32:46,639
and at that point it's often starting by
 

5817
01:32:46,639 --> 01:32:47,750
and at that point it's often starting by
trying to give a question that they

5818
01:32:47,750 --> 01:32:47,760
trying to give a question that they
 

5819
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:48,550
trying to give a question that they
don't know how to do

5820
01:32:48,550 --> 01:32:48,560
don't know how to do
 

5821
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:49,830
don't know how to do
you want to find these questions that

5822
01:32:49,830 --> 01:32:49,840
you want to find these questions that
 

5823
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,910
you want to find these questions that
they don't know how to do that they

5824
01:32:51,910 --> 01:32:51,920
they don't know how to do that they
 

5825
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:54,310
they don't know how to do that they
can think about and then they can solve

5826
01:32:54,310 --> 01:32:54,320
can think about and then they can solve
 

5827
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:55,510
can think about and then they can solve
and then suddenly they say

5828
01:32:55,510 --> 01:32:55,520
and then suddenly they say
 

5829
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:57,669
and then suddenly they say
my gosh i've had a situation i haven't

5830
01:32:57,669 --> 01:32:57,679
my gosh i've had a situation i haven't
 

5831
01:32:57,679 --> 01:32:58,870
my gosh i've had a situation i haven't
i've had an experience

5832
01:32:58,870 --> 01:32:58,880
i've had an experience
 

5833
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:00,709
i've had an experience
where i didn't know what to do and after

5834
01:33:00,709 --> 01:33:00,719
where i didn't know what to do and after
 

5835
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:03,270
where i didn't know what to do and after
a while i did

5836
01:33:03,270 --> 01:33:03,280
a while i did
 

5837
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:06,629
a while i did
is there um advice you can give on how

5838
01:33:06,629 --> 01:33:06,639
is there um advice you can give on how
 

5839
01:33:06,639 --> 01:33:09,990
is there um advice you can give on how
to learn math for people whether it's

5840
01:33:09,990 --> 01:33:10,000
to learn math for people whether it's
 

5841
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,189
to learn math for people whether it's
middle school whether it's somebody

5842
01:33:13,189 --> 01:33:13,199
middle school whether it's somebody
 

5843
01:33:13,199 --> 01:33:16,950
middle school whether it's somebody
as an adult kind of gave up on math

5844
01:33:16,950 --> 01:33:16,960
as an adult kind of gave up on math
 

5845
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:19,189
as an adult kind of gave up on math
maybe early on

5846
01:33:19,189 --> 01:33:19,199
maybe early on
 

5847
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:20,470
maybe early on
i actually think that these math

5848
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:20,480
i actually think that these math
 

5849
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:22,470
i actually think that these math
competition problems those school and

5850
01:33:22,470 --> 01:33:22,480
competition problems those school and
 

5851
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:23,590
competition problems those school and
high school are really good

5852
01:33:23,590 --> 01:33:23,600
high school are really good
 

5853
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:25,750
high school are really good
they're actually very hard so if you if

5854
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:25,760
they're actually very hard so if you if
 

5855
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:26,950
they're actually very hard so if you if
you haven't had this

5856
01:33:26,950 --> 01:33:26,960
you haven't had this
 

5857
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:30,950
you haven't had this
kind of experience before and you grab a

5858
01:33:30,950 --> 01:33:30,960
kind of experience before and you grab a
 

5859
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:32,790
kind of experience before and you grab a
middle school math competition problem

5860
01:33:32,790 --> 01:33:32,800
middle school math competition problem
 

5861
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,470
middle school math competition problem
from the state level which is used to

5862
01:33:34,470 --> 01:33:34,480
from the state level which is used to
 

5863
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,390
from the state level which is used to
decide who represents the state in the

5864
01:33:36,390 --> 01:33:36,400
decide who represents the state in the
 

5865
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:39,030
decide who represents the state in the
country in the united states for example

5866
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:39,040
country in the united states for example
 

5867
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:41,350
country in the united states for example
those are pretty tricky and even if

5868
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:41,360
those are pretty tricky and even if
 

5869
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:43,430
those are pretty tricky and even if
you're a professional

5870
01:33:43,430 --> 01:33:43,440
you're a professional
 

5871
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:45,430
you're a professional
maybe not doing mathematical things and

5872
01:33:45,430 --> 01:33:45,440
maybe not doing mathematical things and
 

5873
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:46,629
maybe not doing mathematical things and
you're not a middle school student

5874
01:33:46,629 --> 01:33:46,639
you're not a middle school student
 

5875
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:48,149
you're not a middle school student
you'll struggle

5876
01:33:48,149 --> 01:33:48,159
you'll struggle
 

5877
01:33:48,159 --> 01:33:49,910
you'll struggle
so i find that these things really do

5878
01:33:49,910 --> 01:33:49,920
so i find that these things really do
 

5879
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:51,750
so i find that these things really do
teach you things but by trying to work

5880
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:51,760
teach you things but by trying to work
 

5881
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:53,030
teach you things but by trying to work
on these questions

5882
01:33:53,030 --> 01:33:53,040
on these questions
 

5883
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:56,149
on these questions
is there a a googleable term that you

5884
01:33:56,149 --> 01:33:56,159
is there a a googleable term that you
 

5885
01:33:56,159 --> 01:33:57,910
is there a a googleable term that you
could use for the organization

5886
01:33:57,910 --> 01:33:57,920
could use for the organization
 

5887
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:00,550
could use for the organization
for the state competitions ah yeah so

5888
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:00,560
for the state competitions ah yeah so
 

5889
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:02,149
for the state competitions ah yeah so
there are a number of different ones

5890
01:34:02,149 --> 01:34:02,159
there are a number of different ones
 

5891
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:03,430
there are a number of different ones
that are quite popular

5892
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:03,440
that are quite popular
 

5893
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:06,110
that are quite popular
one of them is called math counts

5894
01:34:06,110 --> 01:34:06,120
one of them is called math counts
 

5895
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:07,669
one of them is called math counts
m-a-t-h-c-o-u-n-t-s

and that's a big tournament which

5898
01:34:09,030 --> 01:34:09,040
and that's a big tournament which
 

5899
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:10,870
and that's a big tournament which
actually has a state level there's also

5900
01:34:10,870 --> 01:34:10,880
actually has a state level there's also
 

5901
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:13,870
actually has a state level there's also
a math league.org

5902
01:34:13,870 --> 01:34:13,880
a math league.org
 

5903
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:15,990
a math league.org
mathleaguelegue.org also has

5904
01:34:15,990 --> 01:34:16,000
mathleaguelegue.org also has
 

5905
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,750
mathleaguelegue.org also has
this kind of tiered the tournament

5906
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:17,760
this kind of tiered the tournament
 

5907
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:20,070
this kind of tiered the tournament
structure there's also the american math

5908
01:34:20,070 --> 01:34:20,080
structure there's also the american math
 

5909
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:22,470
structure there's also the american math
competitions amc8

5910
01:34:22,470 --> 01:34:22,480
competitions amc8
 

5911
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:25,270
competitions amc8
amc also has amc 10 that's for 10th

5912
01:34:25,270 --> 01:34:25,280
amc also has amc 10 that's for 10th

grade and below and amc 12.
 

5915
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:28,550
grade and below and amc 12.
these are all run by the mathematical

5916
01:34:28,550 --> 01:34:28,560
these are all run by the mathematical
 

5917
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:30,149
these are all run by the mathematical
association of america

5918

association of america
 

5919
01:34:30,159 --> 01:34:31,590
association of america
and these are all ways to find old

5920
01:34:31,590 --> 01:34:31,600
and these are all ways to find old
 

5921
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:33,669
and these are all ways to find old
questions what about the daily

5922
01:34:33,669 --> 01:34:33,679
questions what about the daily
 

5923
01:34:33,679 --> 01:34:35,030
questions what about the daily
challenges that you run

5924
01:34:35,030 --> 01:34:35,040
challenges that you run
 

5925
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:36,709
challenges that you run
what are those about we do that too but

5926
01:34:36,709 --> 01:34:36,719
what are those about we do that too but
 

5927
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:38,870
what are those about we do that too but
i mean the difference was um ours isn't

5928
01:34:38,870 --> 01:34:38,880
i mean the difference was um ours isn't
 

5929
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:41,030
i mean the difference was um ours isn't
that one is not free so so this i should

5930
01:34:41,030 --> 01:34:41,040
that one is not free so so this i should
 

5931
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,310
that one is not free so so this i should
actually probably be careful the things

5932
01:34:42,310 --> 01:34:42,320
actually probably be careful the things
 

5933
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:43,750
actually probably be careful the things
that i've just mentioned are also not

5934
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:43,760
that i've just mentioned are also not
 

5935
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:44,149
that i've just mentioned are also not
free

5936
01:34:44,149 --> 01:34:44,159
free
 

5937
01:34:44,159 --> 01:34:45,430
free
not all of those things i mentioned just

5938
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:45,440
not all of those things i mentioned just
 

5939
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:47,109
not all of those things i mentioned just
now are free either but people can

5940
01:34:47,109 --> 01:34:47,119
now are free either but people can
 

5941
01:34:47,119 --> 01:34:48,629
now are free either but people can
figure out what it is

5942
01:34:48,629 --> 01:34:48,639
figure out what it is
 

5943
01:34:48,639 --> 01:34:50,390
figure out what it is
but yeah this is really nice to know

5944
01:34:50,390 --> 01:34:50,400
but yeah this is really nice to know
 

5945
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:52,149
but yeah this is really nice to know
what's out there but can you speak a

5946
01:34:52,149 --> 01:34:52,159
what's out there but can you speak a
 

5947
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:53,669
what's out there but can you speak a
little bit to the daily challenges

5948
01:34:53,669 --> 01:34:53,679
little bit to the daily challenges
 

5949
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:55,669
little bit to the daily challenges
sure sure so that's actually what we did

5950
01:34:55,669 --> 01:34:55,679
sure sure so that's actually what we did
 

5951
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:56,709
sure sure so that's actually what we did
when um

5952
01:34:56,709 --> 01:34:56,719
when um
 

5953
01:34:56,719 --> 01:34:59,669
when um
i guess i was thinking about how would i

5954
01:34:59,669 --> 01:34:59,679
i guess i was thinking about how would i
 

5955
01:34:59,679 --> 01:34:59,990
i guess i was thinking about how would i
try

5956
01:34:59,990 --> 01:35:00,000
try
 

5957
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,229
try
to develop that skill in people if we

5958
01:35:02,229 --> 01:35:02,239
to develop that skill in people if we
 

5959
01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:04,070
to develop that skill in people if we
had the power to architect the entire

5960
01:35:04,070 --> 01:35:04,080
had the power to architect the entire
 

5961
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:05,189
had the power to architect the entire
system ourselves

5962
01:35:05,189 --> 01:35:05,199
system ourselves
 

5963
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:06,310
system ourselves
so that's called the daily challenge

5964
01:35:06,310 --> 01:35:06,320
so that's called the daily challenge
 

5965
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:08,709
so that's called the daily challenge
with potion low it's not free because

5966
01:35:08,709 --> 01:35:08,719
with potion low it's not free because
 

5967
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:09,990
with potion low it's not free because
that's actually how i pay for everything

5968
01:35:09,990 --> 01:35:10,000
that's actually how i pay for everything
 

5969
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,709
that's actually how i pay for everything
else i do so that's that was the idea

5970
01:35:12,709 --> 01:35:12,719
else i do so that's that was the idea
 

5971
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:15,189
else i do so that's that was the idea
but the the concept was aha now let's

5972
01:35:15,189 --> 01:35:15,199
but the the concept was aha now let's
 

5973
01:35:15,199 --> 01:35:16,310
but the the concept was aha now let's
invent from scratch

5974
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:16,320
invent from scratch
 

5975
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:17,910
invent from scratch
so if we're going to go from scratch and

5976
01:35:17,910 --> 01:35:17,920
so if we're going to go from scratch and
 

5977
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:19,669
so if we're going to go from scratch and
we're going to use technology

5978
01:35:19,669 --> 01:35:19,679
we're going to use technology
 

5979
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:23,030
we're going to use technology
what if we made every single lesson

5980
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:23,040
what if we made every single lesson
 

5981
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:24,950
what if we made every single lesson
something where first i say hey here's

5982
01:35:24,950 --> 01:35:24,960
something where first i say hey here's
 

5983
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:26,229
something where first i say hey here's
an interesting question recorded of

5984
01:35:26,229 --> 01:35:26,239
an interesting question recorded of
 

5985
01:35:26,239 --> 01:35:27,590
an interesting question recorded of
course it's not live but it's like i say

5986
01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:27,600
course it's not live but it's like i say
 

5987
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:28,709
course it's not live but it's like i say
hey here's an interesting question why

5988
01:35:28,709 --> 01:35:28,719
hey here's an interesting question why
 

5989
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:29,669
hey here's an interesting question why
don't we think about this

5990
01:35:29,669 --> 01:35:29,679
don't we think about this
 

5991
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:31,189
don't we think about this
but i know i know you don't know how to

5992
01:35:31,189 --> 01:35:31,199
but i know i know you don't know how to
 

5993
01:35:31,199 --> 01:35:32,790
but i know i know you don't know how to
do it so now you think

5994
01:35:32,790 --> 01:35:32,800
do it so now you think
 

5995
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:34,390
do it so now you think
and a minute later a hint pops on the

5996
01:35:34,390 --> 01:35:34,400
and a minute later a hint pops on the
 

5997
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,629
and a minute later a hint pops on the
screen but you still think and a minute

5998
01:35:36,629 --> 01:35:36,639
screen but you still think and a minute
 

5999
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:38,470
screen but you still think and a minute
later a big hint pops on the screen

6000
01:35:38,470 --> 01:35:38,480
later a big hint pops on the screen
 

6001
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:40,470
later a big hint pops on the screen
you still think and then finally after

6002
01:35:40,470 --> 01:35:40,480
you still think and then finally after
 

6003
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:42,149
you still think and then finally after
the three minutes hopefully you got some

6004
01:35:42,149 --> 01:35:42,159
the three minutes hopefully you got some
 

6005
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:43,590
the three minutes hopefully you got some
ideas you try to answer

6006
01:35:43,590 --> 01:35:43,600
ideas you try to answer
 

6007
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,350
ideas you try to answer
and then suddenly there's like this

6008
01:35:45,350 --> 01:35:45,360
and then suddenly there's like this
 

6009
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:47,590
and then suddenly there's like this
pretty extended explanation of

6010
01:35:47,590 --> 01:35:47,600
pretty extended explanation of
 

6011
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,590
pretty extended explanation of
oh yeah so here's like multiple

6012
01:35:49,590 --> 01:35:49,600
oh yeah so here's like multiple
 

6013
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:50,870
oh yeah so here's like multiple
different ways that you can do the

6014
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:50,880
different ways that you can do the
 

6015
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:51,510
different ways that you can do the
question

6016
01:35:51,510 --> 01:35:51,520
question
 

6017
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:53,430
question
and by accident you also just learn this

6018
01:35:53,430 --> 01:35:53,440
and by accident you also just learn this
 

6019
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:54,550
and by accident you also just learn this
other concept

6020
01:35:54,550 --> 01:35:54,560
other concept
 

6021
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:56,709
other concept
that's what we did so is this targeted

6022
01:35:56,709 --> 01:35:56,719
that's what we did so is this targeted
 

6023
01:35:56,719 --> 01:35:58,070
that's what we did so is this targeted
towards middle school students

6024
01:35:58,070 --> 01:35:58,080
towards middle school students
 

6025
01:35:58,080 --> 01:35:59,910
towards middle school students
high school students it's targeted

6026
01:35:59,910 --> 01:35:59,920
high school students it's targeted
 

6027
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:01,430
high school students it's targeted
towards middle school students with

6028
01:36:01,430 --> 01:36:01,440
towards middle school students with
 

6029
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:02,229
towards middle school students with
competitions

6030
01:36:02,229 --> 01:36:02,239
competitions
 

6031
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:03,590
competitions
but there's a lot of high school

6032
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:03,600
but there's a lot of high school
 

6033
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:05,430
but there's a lot of high school
students who didn't do competitions in

6034
01:36:05,430 --> 01:36:05,440
students who didn't do competitions in
 

6035
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:06,229
students who didn't do competitions in
middle school

6036
01:36:06,229 --> 01:36:06,239
middle school
 

6037
01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:07,669
middle school
where they would also learn how to think

6038
01:36:07,669 --> 01:36:07,679
where they would also learn how to think
 

6039
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:09,669
where they would also learn how to think
if you can see the whole concept was

6040
01:36:09,669 --> 01:36:09,679
if you can see the whole concept was
 

6041
01:36:09,679 --> 01:36:11,830
if you can see the whole concept was
can we teach people how to think how

6042
01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:11,840
can we teach people how to think how
 

6043
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,270
can we teach people how to think how
would you do that you need to give

6044
01:36:13,270 --> 01:36:13,280
would you do that you need to give
 

6045
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:14,390
would you do that you need to give
people the chance to

6046
01:36:14,390 --> 01:36:14,400
people the chance to
 

6047
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:17,189
people the chance to
on their own invent without that kid in

6048
01:36:17,189 --> 01:36:17,199
on their own invent without that kid in
 

6049
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:18,790
on their own invent without that kid in
the front row answering every question

6050
01:36:18,790 --> 01:36:18,800
the front row answering every question
 

6051
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:20,229

01:36:20,229 --> 01:36:20,239
in two seconds
 

6053
01:36:20,239 --> 01:36:22,390
in two seconds
and people can find it i think with

6054
01:36:22,390 --> 01:36:22,400
and people can find it i think with
 

6055
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:25,990
and people can find it i think with
daily dot

6056
01:36:25,990 --> 01:36:26,000

 

6057
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,910

but if you go to find my website you

you'll be able to find it
 

6061
01:36:29,199 --> 01:36:31,830
you'll be able to find it
beautiful can we zoom out a little bit

6062
01:36:31,830 --> 01:36:31,840
beautiful can we zoom out a little bit
 

6063
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:32,790
beautiful can we zoom out a little bit
and uh

6064
01:36:32,790 --> 01:36:32,800
and uh
 

6065
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:35,750
and uh
so day to day week to week month to

so day to day week to week month to
 

6067
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:38,470
so day to day week to week month to
month year to year what does

6068
01:36:38,470 --> 01:36:38,480
month year to year what does
 

6069
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:41,590
month year to year what does
the lifelong educational process look

6070
01:36:41,590 --> 01:36:41,600
the lifelong educational process look
 

6071
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:41,990
the lifelong educational process look
like

6072
01:36:41,990 --> 01:36:42,000
like
 

6073
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,109
like
do you think for for yourself

6074
01:36:45,109 --> 01:36:45,119
do you think for for yourself
 

6075
01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:48,310
do you think for for yourself
but for for me what would you recommend

6076
01:36:48,310 --> 01:36:48,320
but for for me what would you recommend
 

6077
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,709
but for for me what would you recommend
in in the world of mathematics or sort

6078
01:36:50,709 --> 01:36:50,719
in in the world of mathematics or sort
 

6079
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:52,629
in in the world of mathematics or sort
of as opposed to studying for a test but

6080
01:36:52,629 --> 01:36:52,639
of as opposed to studying for a test but
 

6081
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:53,830
of as opposed to studying for a test but
just like

6082
01:36:53,830 --> 01:36:53,840
just like
 

6083
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:57,590
just like
lifelong expanding

6084
01:36:57,590 --> 01:36:57,600
lifelong expanding
 

6085
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,629
lifelong expanding
of uh knowledge and that skill for

6086
01:37:00,629 --> 01:37:00,639
of uh knowledge and that skill for
 

6087
01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:03,590
of uh knowledge and that skill for
invention i think i often articulate

6088
01:37:03,590 --> 01:37:03,600
invention i think i often articulate
 

6089
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:04,950
invention i think i often articulate
this as

6090
01:37:04,950 --> 01:37:04,960
this as
 

6091
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:08,070
this as
can you always try to do more than you

6092
01:37:08,070 --> 01:37:08,080
can you always try to do more than you
 

6093
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:10,790
can you always try to do more than you
could do in the past

6094
01:37:10,790 --> 01:37:10,800
could do in the past
 

6095
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:14,149
could do in the past
yeah but that comes in many ways and

6096
01:37:14,149 --> 01:37:14,159
yeah but that comes in many ways and
 

6097
01:37:14,159 --> 01:37:16,149
yeah but that comes in many ways and
i will say it's great if one wants to

6098
01:37:16,149 --> 01:37:16,159
i will say it's great if one wants to
 

6099
01:37:16,159 --> 01:37:17,590
i will say it's great if one wants to
build that with mathematics

6100
01:37:17,590 --> 01:37:17,600
build that with mathematics
 

6101
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,350
build that with mathematics
but it's also great to use that

6102
01:37:19,350 --> 01:37:19,360
but it's also great to use that
 

6103
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:20,950
but it's also great to use that
philosophy with all other things

6104
01:37:20,950 --> 01:37:20,960
philosophy with all other things
 

6105
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:23,109
philosophy with all other things
in fact if i if i just think of myself i

6106
01:37:23,109 --> 01:37:23,119
in fact if i if i just think of myself i
 

6107
01:37:23,119 --> 01:37:25,189
in fact if i if i just think of myself i
just think what do i know now that i

6108
01:37:25,189 --> 01:37:25,199
just think what do i know now that i
 

6109
01:37:25,199 --> 01:37:27,109
just think what do i know now that i
didn't know a year ago or a month ago or

6110
01:37:27,109 --> 01:37:27,119
didn't know a year ago or a month ago or
 

6111
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:28,310
didn't know a year ago or a month ago or
a week ago

6112
01:37:28,310 --> 01:37:28,320
a week ago
 

6113
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,910
a week ago
and not just know but like what do i

6114
01:37:29,910 --> 01:37:29,920
and not just know but like what do i
 

6115
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:31,830
and not just know but like what do i
have the capability of doing yes

6116
01:37:31,830 --> 01:37:31,840
have the capability of doing yes
 

6117
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:33,669
have the capability of doing yes
and if you just have that attitude it

6118
01:37:33,669 --> 01:37:33,679
and if you just have that attitude it
 

6119
01:37:33,679 --> 01:37:34,950
and if you just have that attitude it
brings more

6120
01:37:34,950 --> 01:37:34,960
brings more
 

6121
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:38,229
brings more
see the thing is there's also a habit

6122
01:37:38,229 --> 01:37:38,239
see the thing is there's also a habit
 

6123
01:37:38,239 --> 01:37:42,149
see the thing is there's also a habit
like it is a skill like i've been using

6124
01:37:42,149 --> 01:37:42,159
like it is a skill like i've been using
 

6125
01:37:42,159 --> 01:37:45,109
like it is a skill like i've been using
anki it's an app for helps you memorize

6126
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:45,119
anki it's an app for helps you memorize
 

6127
01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:46,629
anki it's an app for helps you memorize
things

6128
01:37:46,629 --> 01:37:46,639
things
 

6129
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:49,830
things
and i've actually just a

6130
01:37:49,830 --> 01:37:49,840
and i've actually just a
 

6131
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:52,229
and i've actually just a
few months ago started doing this daily

6132
01:37:52,229 --> 01:37:52,239
few months ago started doing this daily
 

6133
01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:53,030
few months ago started doing this daily
of uh

6134
01:37:53,030 --> 01:37:53,040
of uh
 

6135
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:55,910
of uh
setting aside time to think about an

6136
01:37:55,910 --> 01:37:55,920
setting aside time to think about an
 

6137
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:58,229
setting aside time to think about an
idea

6138
01:37:58,229 --> 01:37:58,239
idea
 

6139
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:01,669
idea
that's outside of my work like let's say

6140
01:38:01,669 --> 01:38:01,679
that's outside of my work like let's say
 

6141
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:02,310
that's outside of my work like let's say
let's pick

6142
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:02,320
let's pick
 

6143
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:04,390
let's pick
put it it's all over the place by the

6144
01:38:04,390 --> 01:38:04,400
put it it's all over the place by the
 

6145
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:06,390
put it it's all over the place by the
way but let's say politics like gun

6146
01:38:06,390 --> 01:38:06,400
way but let's say politics like gun
 

6147
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:07,830
way but let's say politics like gun
control

6148
01:38:07,830 --> 01:38:07,840
control
 

6149
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,590
control
uh is it good to have a lot of guns or

6150
01:38:09,590 --> 01:38:09,600
uh is it good to have a lot of guns or
 

6151
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:11,669
uh is it good to have a lot of guns or
not in society

6152
01:38:11,669 --> 01:38:11,679
not in society
 

6153
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:14,950
not in society
and just i've set aside time every day

6154
01:38:14,950 --> 01:38:14,960
and just i've set aside time every day
 

6155
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:16,629
and just i've set aside time every day
i do at least 10 minutes but i try to do

6156
01:38:16,629 --> 01:38:16,639
i do at least 10 minutes but i try to do
 

6157
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:19,030
i do at least 10 minutes but i try to do
30 where i think about a problem and

6158
01:38:19,030 --> 01:38:19,040
30 where i think about a problem and
 

6159
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:20,470
30 where i think about a problem and
kind of outlining for myself from

6160
01:38:20,470 --> 01:38:20,480
kind of outlining for myself from
 

6161
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:22,149
kind of outlining for myself from
scratch from not looking anything up

6162
01:38:22,149 --> 01:38:22,159
scratch from not looking anything up
 

6163
01:38:22,159 --> 01:38:23,510
scratch from not looking anything up
just thinking about it

6164
01:38:23,510 --> 01:38:23,520
just thinking about it
 

6165
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:27,350
just thinking about it
using common sense and i think the

6166
01:38:27,350 --> 01:38:27,360
using common sense and i think the
 

6167
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,030
using common sense and i think the
practice of that is really important

6168
01:38:29,030 --> 01:38:29,040
practice of that is really important
 

6169
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:30,950
practice of that is really important
it's the daily routine of it

6170
01:38:30,950 --> 01:38:30,960
it's the daily routine of it
 

6171
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:33,510
it's the daily routine of it
it's the discipline of it it's not just

6172
01:38:33,510 --> 01:38:33,520
it's the discipline of it it's not just
 

6173
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:34,390
it's the discipline of it it's not just
that

6174
01:38:34,390 --> 01:38:34,400
that
 

6175
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:37,030
that
i figured something out from that

6176
01:38:37,030 --> 01:38:37,040
i figured something out from that
 

6177
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:38,709
i figured something out from that
thinking about gun control

6178
01:38:38,709 --> 01:38:38,719
thinking about gun control
 

6179
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:42,709
thinking about gun control
it's more that that muscle is built

6180
01:38:42,709 --> 01:38:42,719
it's more that that muscle is built
 

6181
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:44,790
it's more that that muscle is built
too it's that thinking muscle so i'm

6182
01:38:44,790 --> 01:38:44,800
too it's that thinking muscle so i'm
 

6183
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:46,870
too it's that thinking muscle so i'm
kind of interested in

6184
01:38:46,870 --> 01:38:46,880
kind of interested in
 

6185
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:50,229
kind of interested in
you know math has because especially

6186
01:38:50,229 --> 01:38:50,239
you know math has because especially
 

6187
01:38:50,239 --> 01:38:50,550
you know math has because especially
because

6188
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:50,560
because
 

6189
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:52,470
because
i've gotten specialized into machine

6190
01:38:52,470 --> 01:38:52,480
i've gotten specialized into machine
 

6191
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:54,310
i've gotten specialized into machine
learning and because i love programming

6192
01:38:54,310 --> 01:38:54,320
learning and because i love programming
 

6193
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:55,189

so much

6194
01:38:55,189 --> 01:38:55,199
so much
 

6195
01:38:55,199 --> 01:38:58,310
so much
i've lost touch with math

6196
01:38:58,310 --> 01:38:58,320
i've lost touch with math
 

6197
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:01,350
i've lost touch with math
a little bit to where i feel

6198
01:39:01,350 --> 01:39:01,360
a little bit to where i feel
 

6199
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:03,350
a little bit to where i feel
quite sad about it and i want to fix

6200
01:39:03,350 --> 01:39:03,360
quite sad about it and i want to fix
 

6201
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:04,950
quite sad about it and i want to fix
that um

6202
01:39:04,950 --> 01:39:04,960
that um
 

6203
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:07,109
that um
even just not math like pure knowledge

6204
01:39:07,109 --> 01:39:07,119
even just not math like pure knowledge
 

6205
01:39:07,119 --> 01:39:08,950
even just not math like pure knowledge
math but math like these middle school

6206
01:39:08,950 --> 01:39:08,960
math but math like these middle school
 

6207
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:10,070
math but math like these middle school
problems

6208
01:39:10,070 --> 01:39:10,080
problems
 

6209
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:13,189
problems
the challenges right um

6210
01:39:13,189 --> 01:39:13,199
the challenges right um
 

6211
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:14,709
the challenges right um
is that something you see a person be

6212
01:39:14,709 --> 01:39:14,719
is that something you see a person be
 

6213
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:16,709
is that something you see a person be
able to do every single day kind of just

6214
01:39:16,709 --> 01:39:16,719
able to do every single day kind of just
 

6215
01:39:16,719 --> 01:39:17,270
able to do every single day kind of just
practice

6216
01:39:17,270 --> 01:39:17,280
practice
 

6217
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:20,390
practice
every single day for years so i can give

6218
01:39:20,390 --> 01:39:20,400
every single day for years so i can give
 

6219
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:22,310
every single day for years so i can give
an answer to that that gives a practical

6220
01:39:22,310 --> 01:39:22,320
an answer to that that gives a practical
 

6221
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:23,750
an answer to that that gives a practical
way you could do it assuming you have

6222
01:39:23,750 --> 01:39:23,760
way you could do it assuming you have
 

6223
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:24,310
way you could do it assuming you have
kids

6224
01:39:24,310 --> 01:39:24,320
kids
 

6225
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:28,870
kids
so i

6226
01:39:28,870 --> 01:39:28,880

 

6227
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,390

i'm just saying this because i'm just

6228
01:39:30,390 --> 01:39:30,400
i'm just saying this because i'm just
 

6229
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:31,830
i'm just saying this because i'm just
thinking out loud right now like what

6230
01:39:31,830 --> 01:39:31,840
thinking out loud right now like what
 

6231
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:32,550
thinking out loud right now like what
could i do

6232
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:32,560
could i do
 

6233
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:34,149
could i do
what could i do to suggest because what

6234
01:39:34,149 --> 01:39:34,159
what could i do to suggest because what
 

6235
01:39:34,159 --> 01:39:35,990
what could i do to suggest because what
i have noticed is that for example if

6236
01:39:35,990 --> 01:39:36,000
i have noticed is that for example if
 

6237
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,510
i have noticed is that for example if
you do have kids who are in elementary

6238
01:39:37,510 --> 01:39:37,520
you do have kids who are in elementary
 

6239
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:39,109
you do have kids who are in elementary
school or middle school

6240
01:39:39,109 --> 01:39:39,119
school or middle school
 

6241
01:39:39,119 --> 01:39:41,510
school or middle school
if you yourself go and look at those

6242
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:41,520
if you yourself go and look at those
 

6243
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:42,950
if you yourself go and look at those
middle school math problems

6244
01:39:42,950 --> 01:39:42,960
middle school math problems
 

6245
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:44,709
middle school math problems
to think about interesting ways that you

6246
01:39:44,709 --> 01:39:44,719
to think about interesting ways that you
 

6247
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:46,149
to think about interesting ways that you
can teach your elementary school or

6248
01:39:46,149 --> 01:39:46,159
can teach your elementary school or
 

6249
01:39:46,159 --> 01:39:47,590
can teach your elementary school or
middle school kid

6250
01:39:47,590 --> 01:39:47,600
middle school kid
 

6251
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:49,030
middle school kid
it works that's what my wife did she

6252
01:39:49,030 --> 01:39:49,040
it works that's what my wife did she
 

6253
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:50,950
it works that's what my wife did she
never did any of those contests before

6254
01:39:50,950 --> 01:39:50,960
never did any of those contests before
 

6255
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:53,030
never did any of those contests before
but now she knows quite a lot about that

6256
01:39:53,030 --> 01:39:53,040
but now she knows quite a lot about that
 

6257
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:54,310
but now she knows quite a lot about that
i didn't teach her anything i don't i

6258
01:39:54,310 --> 01:39:54,320
i didn't teach her anything i don't i
 

6259
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:55,109
i didn't teach her anything i don't i
don't do that

6260
01:39:55,109 --> 01:39:55,119
don't do that
 

6261
01:39:55,119 --> 01:39:57,270
don't do that
she just was messing around with them

6262
01:39:57,270 --> 01:39:57,280
she just was messing around with them
 

6263
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:58,229
she just was messing around with them
and taught herself

6264
01:39:58,229 --> 01:39:58,239
and taught herself
 

6265
01:39:58,239 --> 01:40:00,390
and taught herself
all of that stuff and that had the

6266
01:40:00,390 --> 01:40:00,400
all of that stuff and that had the
 

6267
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,229
all of that stuff and that had the
automatic daily i i'm always thinking

6268
01:40:02,229 --> 01:40:02,239
automatic daily i i'm always thinking
 

6269
01:40:02,239 --> 01:40:03,669
automatic daily i i'm always thinking
how do you make it practical right yes

6270
01:40:03,669 --> 01:40:03,679
how do you make it practical right yes
 

6271
01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:04,870
how do you make it practical right yes
and the way to make it practical

6272
01:40:04,870 --> 01:40:04,880
and the way to make it practical
 

6273
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:06,950
and the way to make it practical
is if the the timer on the automatically

6274
01:40:06,950 --> 01:40:06,960
is if the the timer on the automatically
 

6275
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:08,629
is if the the timer on the automatically
daily is that you are going to

6276
01:40:08,629 --> 01:40:08,639
daily is that you are going to
 

6277
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:10,149
daily is that you are going to
automatically daily do something with

6278
01:40:10,149 --> 01:40:10,159
automatically daily do something with
 

6279
01:40:10,159 --> 01:40:10,790
automatically daily do something with
your own kid

6280
01:40:10,790 --> 01:40:10,800
your own kid
 

6281
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:13,590
your own kid
yes now it feeds back okay and that

6282
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:13,600
yes now it feeds back okay and that
 

6283
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:15,030
yes now it feeds back okay and that
includes the whole lesson that if you

6284
01:40:15,030 --> 01:40:15,040
includes the whole lesson that if you
 

6285
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:16,390
includes the whole lesson that if you
want to learn something you should teach

6286
01:40:16,390 --> 01:40:16,400
want to learn something you should teach
 

6287
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:16,790
want to learn something you should teach
it

6288
01:40:16,790 --> 01:40:16,800
it
 

6289
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:19,189
it
oh i strongly believe that yes i

6290
01:40:19,189 --> 01:40:19,199
oh i strongly believe that yes i
 

6291
01:40:19,199 --> 01:40:21,189
oh i strongly believe that yes i
strongly believe

6292
01:40:21,189 --> 01:40:21,199
strongly believe
 

6293
01:40:21,199 --> 01:40:23,350
strongly believe
and that so i currently don't have kids

6294
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:23,360
and that so i currently don't have kids
 

6295
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:24,310
and that so i currently don't have kids
so that's uh

6296
01:40:24,310 --> 01:40:24,320
so that's uh
 

6297
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:25,910
so that's uh
maybe i should just get kids to help me

6298
01:40:25,910 --> 01:40:25,920
maybe i should just get kids to help me
 

6299
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:27,590
maybe i should just get kids to help me
with the math thing but

6300
01:40:27,590 --> 01:40:27,600
with the math thing but
 

6301
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:30,790
with the math thing but
outside of that i i do want to do great

6302
01:40:30,790 --> 01:40:30,800
outside of that i i do want to do great
 

6303
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:32,229
outside of that i i do want to do great
math into daily practice so

6304
01:40:32,229 --> 01:40:32,239
math into daily practice so
 

6305
01:40:32,239 --> 01:40:34,070
math into daily practice so
i'll definitely take out uh i'll

6306
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:34,080
i'll definitely take out uh i'll
 

6307
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:35,350
i'll definitely take out uh i'll
definitely check out the daily

01:40:49,990 --> 01:40:50,000
they don't speak to the thing that i'm

01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,550
they don't speak to the thing that i'm
referring to which is the daily practice

01:40:52,550 --> 01:40:52,560
referring to which is the daily practice
 

6327
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:56,229
referring to which is the daily practice
they're more almost tools of inspiration

6328
01:40:56,229 --> 01:40:56,239
they're more almost tools of inspiration
 

6329
01:40:56,239 --> 01:40:58,629
they're more almost tools of inspiration
they kind of show you the beauty of a

of problem in mathematics
 

6335
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:06,310
of problem in mathematics
but they're not a daily ritual and i'm

6336
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:06,320
but they're not a daily ritual and i'm
 

6337
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:06,870
but they're not a daily ritual and i'm
i'm in

6338
01:41:06,870 --> 01:41:06,880
i'm in
 

6339
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:08,550
i'm in
i'm in search of that daily ritual

6340
01:41:08,550 --> 01:41:08,560
i'm in search of that daily ritual
 

6341
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:10,629
i'm in search of that daily ritual
mathematics it's not it's not trivial to

find
 

6345
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:15,910
find
um but uh i hope

6346
01:41:15,910 --> 01:41:15,920
um but uh i hope
 

6347
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:18,310
um but uh i hope
i hope to find that because i think math

6348
01:41:18,310 --> 01:41:18,320
i hope to find that because i think math
 

6349
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:20,870
i hope to find that because i think math
gives you a perspective on the world

6350
01:41:20,870 --> 01:41:20,880
gives you a perspective on the world
 

6351
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:24,310
gives you a perspective on the world
that enriches everything else so i like

6352
01:41:24,310 --> 01:41:24,320
that enriches everything else so i like
 

6353
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:25,750
that enriches everything else so i like
what you said about the daily also

6354
01:41:25,750 --> 01:41:25,760
what you said about the daily also
 

6355
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:28,149
what you said about the daily also
because that's also one reason why i put

6356
01:41:28,149 --> 01:41:28,159
because that's also one reason why i put
 

6357
01:41:28,159 --> 01:41:30,229
because that's also one reason why i put
my carnegie mellon class online it's not

6358
01:41:30,229 --> 01:41:30,239
my carnegie mellon class online it's not
 

6359
01:41:30,239 --> 01:41:31,669
my carnegie mellon class online it's not
every day it was every it's every other

day semester is almost over

6362
01:41:33,189 --> 01:41:33,199
day semester is almost over
 

6363
01:41:33,199 --> 01:41:35,590
day semester is almost over
but the idea was i guess my philosophy

6364
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:35,600
but the idea was i guess my philosophy
 

6365
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:37,430
but the idea was i guess my philosophy
was if i'm already doing the class let's

6366
01:41:37,430 --> 01:41:37,440
was if i'm already doing the class let's
 

6367
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:38,790
was if i'm already doing the class let's
just like put it there right

6368
01:41:38,790 --> 01:41:38,800
just like put it there right
 

6369
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:40,950
just like put it there right
but i do know that there are people who

6370
01:41:40,950 --> 01:41:40,960
but i do know that there are people who
 

6371
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:42,149
but i do know that there are people who
have been following it

6372
01:41:42,149 --> 01:41:42,159
have been following it
 

6373
01:41:42,159 --> 01:41:44,149
have been following it
who are not in my class at all who have

6374
01:41:44,149 --> 01:41:44,159
who are not in my class at all who have
 

6375
01:41:44,159 --> 01:41:46,229
who are not in my class at all who have
just been following it because yes it's

6376
01:41:46,229 --> 01:41:46,239
just been following it because yes it's
 

6377
01:41:46,239 --> 01:41:47,430

combinatorics

6378
01:41:47,430 --> 01:41:47,440
combinatorics
 

6379
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:49,830
combinatorics
and the value of that is you could you

6380
01:41:49,830 --> 01:41:49,840
and the value of that is you could you
 

6381
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:51,350
and the value of that is you could you
don't really need to know calculus to

6382
01:41:51,350 --> 01:41:51,360
don't really need to know calculus to
 

6383
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:52,629
don't really need to know calculus to
follow it if that makes sense

6384
01:41:52,629 --> 01:41:52,639
follow it if that makes sense
 

6385
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:53,990
follow it if that makes sense
so it's actually something that people

6386
01:41:53,990 --> 01:41:54,000
so it's actually something that people
 

6387
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,590
so it's actually something that people
could follow so again and that one's

6388
01:41:55,590 --> 01:41:55,600
could follow so again and that one's
 

6389
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:56,390
could follow so again and that one's
free so

6390
01:41:56,390 --> 01:41:56,400
free so
 

6391
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:58,950
free so
that was just there on youtube well

6392
01:41:58,950 --> 01:41:58,960
that was just there on youtube well
 

6393
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:00,470
that was just there on youtube well
speaking of combinatorics

6394
01:42:00,470 --> 01:42:00,480
speaking of combinatorics
 

6395
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:03,189
speaking of combinatorics
uh what is it what do you find

6396
01:42:03,189 --> 01:42:03,199
uh what is it what do you find
 

6397
01:42:03,199 --> 01:42:05,510
uh what is it what do you find
interesting what do you find beautiful

6398
01:42:05,510 --> 01:42:05,520
interesting what do you find beautiful
 

6399
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:08,709
interesting what do you find beautiful
about combinatorics so combinatorics to

about combinatorics so combinatorics to
me

6402

me
 

6403
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:13,030
me
is is the study of things where

6404
01:42:13,030 --> 01:42:13,040
is is the study of things where
 

6405
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:16,229
is is the study of things where
they might be more finite and more

6406
01:42:16,229 --> 01:42:16,239
they might be more finite and more
 

6407
01:42:16,239 --> 01:42:17,189
they might be more finite and more
discreet

discreet
 

6409
01:42:17,199 --> 01:42:18,470
discreet
what i mean is like if i look at a

6410
01:42:18,470 --> 01:42:18,480
what i mean is like if i look at a
 

6411
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:19,910
what i mean is like if i look at a
network actually a lot of times the

6412
01:42:19,910 --> 01:42:19,920
network actually a lot of times the
 

6413
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:21,270
network actually a lot of times the
combinatorics will boil down to

6414
01:42:21,270 --> 01:42:21,280
combinatorics will boil down to
 

6415
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:22,870
combinatorics will boil down to
something and the combinatorics i think

6416
01:42:22,870 --> 01:42:22,880
something and the combinatorics i think
 

6417
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:24,470
something and the combinatorics i think
about might be something related to

6418
01:42:24,470 --> 01:42:24,480
about might be something related to
 

6419
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:26,629
about might be something related to
graphs or networks and they're very

6420
01:42:26,629 --> 01:42:26,639
graphs or networks and they're very
 

6421
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:28,709
graphs or networks and they're very
discreet because if you have a node

6422
01:42:28,709 --> 01:42:28,719
discreet because if you have a node
 

6423
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:31,270
discreet because if you have a node
it's not that you have point seven of a

6424
01:42:31,270 --> 01:42:31,280
it's not that you have point seven of a
 

6425
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:31,990
it's not that you have point seven of a
node

6426
01:42:31,990 --> 01:42:32,000
node
 

6427
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,350
node
and point three of a node over there

6428
01:42:33,350 --> 01:42:33,360
and point three of a node over there
 

6429
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:35,030
and point three of a node over there
it's like you got one node and then you

6430
01:42:35,030 --> 01:42:35,040
it's like you got one node and then you
 

6431
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:37,350
it's like you got one node and then you
jump one step to go to the next node

6432
01:42:37,350 --> 01:42:37,360
jump one step to go to the next node
 

6433
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:38,950
jump one step to go to the next node
so that that notion is different from

6434
01:42:38,950 --> 01:42:38,960
so that that notion is different from
 

6435
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:40,709
so that that notion is different from
say calculus which is very

6436

say calculus which is very
 

6437
01:42:40,719 --> 01:42:42,870

uh continuous where you go and say i

6438
01:42:42,870 --> 01:42:42,880
uh continuous where you go and say i
 

6439
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:43,830
uh continuous where you go and say i
have this

6440
01:42:43,830 --> 01:42:43,840
have this
 

6441
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:46,229
have this
speed which is changing over time and

6442
01:42:46,229 --> 01:42:46,239
speed which is changing over time and
 

6443
01:42:46,239 --> 01:42:47,590
speed which is changing over time and
now what's the distance i've traveled

6444
01:42:47,590 --> 01:42:47,600
now what's the distance i've traveled
 

6445
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:48,950
now what's the distance i've traveled
that's the notion of an integral

6446
01:42:48,950 --> 01:42:48,960
that's the notion of an integral
 

6447
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:50,550
that's the notion of an integral
where you have to think of subdividing

6448
01:42:50,550 --> 01:42:50,560
where you have to think of subdividing
 

6449
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:52,550
where you have to think of subdividing
time into very very small pieces

6450
01:42:52,550 --> 01:42:52,560
time into very very small pieces
 

6451
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:54,470
time into very very small pieces
so the kinds of things that you do when

6452
01:42:54,470 --> 01:42:54,480
so the kinds of things that you do when
 

6453
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:56,870
so the kinds of things that you do when
you reason about these

6454
01:42:56,870 --> 01:42:56,880
you reason about these
 

6455
01:42:56,880 --> 01:43:00,070
you reason about these
finite discrete structures often might

01:43:00,070 --> 01:43:00,080
finite discrete structures often might
 

6457
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:03,189
finite discrete structures often might
be iterative algorithmic inductive

these are ideas where i go from one step
 

6461
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:07,109
these are ideas where i go from one step
to the next step and so on and make

actually that's honestly the reason i
went into that direction i met a really

01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,430
he seemed like he did good stuff
interesting stuff and he looked like he

6486
01:43:25,430 --> 01:43:25,440
interesting stuff and he looked like he
 

6487
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,550
interesting stuff and he looked like he
cared about students

6488
01:43:26,550 --> 01:43:26,560
cared about students
 

6489
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:28,070
cared about students
and i said let me just go and learn

6490
01:43:28,070 --> 01:43:28,080
and i said let me just go and learn
 

6491

6513
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:58,310

01:43:58,310 --> 01:43:58,320
is there could you speak to the idea of
 

6515
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:00,790
is there could you speak to the idea of
complexity analysis of problems do you

6516
01:44:00,790 --> 01:44:00,800
complexity analysis of problems do you
 

6517
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:04,390
complexity analysis of problems do you
find it useful to find it interesting

6518
01:44:04,390 --> 01:44:04,400
find it useful to find it interesting
 

6519
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:07,030
find it useful to find it interesting
do you do you find that lens of studying

6520
01:44:07,030 --> 01:44:07,040
do you do you find that lens of studying
 

6521
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:08,149
do you do you find that lens of studying
the difficulty

6522
01:44:08,149 --> 01:44:08,159
the difficulty
 

6523
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:11,109
the difficulty
of how difficult the computer science

much so

6530
01:44:16,149 --> 01:44:16,159
much so
 

6531
01:44:16,159 --> 01:44:19,669
much so
because um if you want to make something

6532
01:44:19,669 --> 01:44:19,679
because um if you want to make something
 

6533
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:21,510
because um if you want to make something
practical which has large numbers of

the computational complexity to me is

6538
01:44:25,189 --> 01:44:25,199
the computational complexity to me is
 

6539
01:44:25,199 --> 01:44:27,109
the computational complexity to me is
almost question one

6540
01:44:27,109 --> 01:44:27,119
almost question one
 

6541
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:29,030
almost question one
and that's again that's at the origin of

6542
01:44:29,030 --> 01:44:29,040
and that's again that's at the origin of
 

6543
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:30,390
and that's again that's at the origin of
when we started doing this stuff with

6544
01:44:30,390 --> 01:44:30,400
when we started doing this stuff with
 

6545
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:31,669
when we started doing this stuff with
disease control

6546
01:44:31,669 --> 01:44:31,679

6547
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:32,950

01:44:32,950 --> 01:44:32,960
from the very beginning the deep
 

6549
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:34,229
from the very beginning the deep
questions that were running through my

6550
01:44:34,229 --> 01:44:34,239
questions that were running through my
 

6551
01:44:34,239 --> 01:44:35,350
questions that were running through my
mind were

6552
01:44:35,350 --> 01:44:35,360
mind were
 

6553
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:37,030
mind were
would we be able to support a large

6554
01:44:37,030 --> 01:44:37,040
would we be able to support a large
 

6555
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:38,390
would we be able to support a large
population

6556
01:44:38,390 --> 01:44:38,400
population
 

6557
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:41,750
population
with only one server and if the answer

6558
01:44:41,750 --> 01:44:41,760
with only one server and if the answer
 

6559
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:42,550
with only one server and if the answer
is no

6560
01:44:42,550 --> 01:44:42,560
is no
 

6561
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:44,229
is no
we can't start because i don't have

6562
01:44:44,229 --> 01:44:44,239
we can't start because i don't have
 

6563
01:44:44,239 --> 01:44:48,149
we can't start because i don't have
enough money

6564
01:44:48,149 --> 01:44:48,159
enough money
 

6565
01:44:48,159 --> 01:44:50,709
enough money
yeah and there the question is very much

6566
01:44:50,709 --> 01:44:50,719
yeah and there the question is very much
 

6567
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:52,470
yeah and there the question is very much
you know linear time versus

6568
01:44:52,470 --> 01:44:52,480
you know linear time versus
 

6569
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:55,510
you know linear time versus
anything uh

6570
01:44:55,510 --> 01:44:55,520
anything uh
 

6571
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:58,709
anything uh
anything slower than linear time um it's

6572
01:44:58,709 --> 01:44:58,719
anything slower than linear time um it's
 

6573
01:44:58,719 --> 01:45:00,149
anything slower than linear time um it's
a very specific thing you have a bunch

6574
01:45:00,149 --> 01:45:00,159
a very specific thing you have a bunch
 

6575
01:45:00,159 --> 01:45:01,750
a very specific thing you have a bunch
of really interesting papers if i could

6576
01:45:01,750 --> 01:45:01,760
of really interesting papers if i could
 

6577
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:02,070
of really interesting papers if i could
ask

6578
01:45:02,070 --> 01:45:02,080
ask
 

6579
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:03,350
ask
maybe we could pull out some cool

6580
01:45:03,350 --> 01:45:03,360
maybe we could pull out some cool
 

6581
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:06,070
maybe we could pull out some cool
insights at the high level

6582
01:45:06,070 --> 01:45:06,080
insights at the high level
 

6583
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:07,910
insights at the high level
can you describe the data structure of a

6584
01:45:07,910 --> 01:45:07,920
can you describe the data structure of a
 

6585
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:09,430
can you describe the data structure of a
voting tree and

6586
01:45:09,430 --> 01:45:09,440
voting tree and
 

6587
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:11,109
voting tree and
what are some interesting results on it

6588
01:45:11,109 --> 01:45:11,119
what are some interesting results on it
 

6589
01:45:11,119 --> 01:45:13,669
what are some interesting results on it
you have a paper that i noticed on it

6590
01:45:13,669 --> 01:45:13,679
you have a paper that i noticed on it
 

6591
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:17,030
you have a paper that i noticed on it
yeah so this is an example of i guess

6592
01:45:17,030 --> 01:45:17,040
yeah so this is an example of i guess
 

6593
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:20,310
yeah so this is an example of i guess
um how in math we might say here's an

6594
01:45:20,310 --> 01:45:20,320
um how in math we might say here's an
 

6595
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:22,229
um how in math we might say here's an
interesting kind of a question

6596
01:45:22,229 --> 01:45:22,239
interesting kind of a question
 

6597
01:45:22,239 --> 01:45:24,870
interesting kind of a question
that we just can't seem to understand

6598
01:45:24,870 --> 01:45:24,880
that we just can't seem to understand
 

6599
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:25,590
that we just can't seem to understand
enough about

6600
01:45:25,590 --> 01:45:25,600
enough about
 

6601
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:26,950
enough about
maybe there's something else going on

6602
01:45:26,950 --> 01:45:26,960
maybe there's something else going on
 

6603
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:30,070
maybe there's something else going on
here and the way to describe this is

6604
01:45:30,070 --> 01:45:30,080
here and the way to describe this is
 

6605
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:31,669
here and the way to describe this is
you could imagine trying to hold

6606
01:45:31,669 --> 01:45:31,679
you could imagine trying to hold
 

6607
01:45:31,679 --> 01:45:33,270
you could imagine trying to hold
elections where

6608
01:45:33,270 --> 01:45:33,280
elections where
 

6609
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:35,189
elections where
if you have only two candidates that's

6610
01:45:35,189 --> 01:45:35,199
if you have only two candidates that's
 

6611
01:45:35,199 --> 01:45:36,709
if you have only two candidates that's
kind of easy you just run them against

6612
01:45:36,709 --> 01:45:36,719
kind of easy you just run them against
 

6613
01:45:36,719 --> 01:45:38,470
kind of easy you just run them against
each other and see who gets more votes

6614
01:45:38,470 --> 01:45:38,480
each other and see who gets more votes
 

6615
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:39,750
each other and see who gets more votes
but as you know once you have more

6616
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:39,760
but as you know once you have more
 

6617
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:41,990
but as you know once you have more
candidates it's very difficult to decide

6618
01:45:41,990 --> 01:45:42,000
candidates it's very difficult to decide
 

6619
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,030
candidates it's very difficult to decide
who wins the election

6620
01:45:43,030 --> 01:45:43,040
who wins the election
 

6621
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:45,030
who wins the election
and there's an entire like voting theory

6622
01:45:45,030 --> 01:45:45,040
and there's an entire like voting theory
 

6623
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:46,310
and there's an entire like voting theory
around this

6624
01:45:46,310 --> 01:45:46,320
around this
 

6625
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:49,350
around this
so a a theoretical question became

6626
01:45:49,350 --> 01:45:49,360
so a a theoretical question became
 

6627
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:52,470
so a a theoretical question became
what if you made a like a system of

6628
01:45:52,470 --> 01:45:52,480
what if you made a like a system of
 

6629
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:55,430
what if you made a like a system of
runoffs like a system of heads uh

6630
01:45:55,430 --> 01:45:55,440
runoffs like a system of heads uh
 

6631
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:57,030
runoffs like a system of heads uh
head-to-head contests

6632
01:45:57,030 --> 01:45:57,040
head-to-head contests
 

6633
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:58,870
head-to-head contests
which you structure like a tree almost

6634
01:45:58,870 --> 01:45:58,880
which you structure like a tree almost
 

6635
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:00,070
which you structure like a tree almost
looking like a circuit

6636
01:46:00,070 --> 01:46:00,080
looking like a circuit
 

6637
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:01,990
looking like a circuit
i'm using that way of thinking because

6638
01:46:01,990 --> 01:46:02,000
i'm using that way of thinking because
 

6639
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,590
i'm using that way of thinking because
it's sort of like a in

6646
01:46:07,669 --> 01:46:07,679
of
 

6647
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:09,750
of
leads that carry signal which are going

6648
01:46:09,750 --> 01:46:09,760
leads that carry signal which are going
 

6649
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:11,109
leads that carry signal which are going
through and gates and or gains and

6650
01:46:11,109 --> 01:46:11,119
through and gates and or gains and
 

6651
01:46:11,119 --> 01:46:12,470
through and gates and or gains and
whatnot and you've managed to compute

6652
01:46:12,470 --> 01:46:12,480
whatnot and you've managed to compute
 

6653
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:13,510
whatnot and you've managed to compute
beautiful things

6654
01:46:13,510 --> 01:46:13,520
beautiful things
 

6655
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:15,510
beautiful things
this is just from a purely abstract

6656
01:46:15,510 --> 01:46:15,520
this is just from a purely abstract
 

6657
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:17,350
this is just from a purely abstract
point of view what if the inputs are

6658
01:46:17,350 --> 01:46:17,360
point of view what if the inputs are
 

6659
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:18,470
point of view what if the inputs are
candidates

6660
01:46:18,470 --> 01:46:18,480
candidates
 

6661
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:20,790
candidates
and for every two candidates it is known

6662
01:46:20,790 --> 01:46:20,800
and for every two candidates it is known
 

6663
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:22,390
and for every two candidates it is known
which of the candidates is more popular

6664
01:46:22,390 --> 01:46:22,400
which of the candidates is more popular
 

6665
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:23,350
which of the candidates is more popular
than the other

6666
01:46:23,350 --> 01:46:23,360
than the other
 

6667
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:25,350
than the other
now can you build some kind of a circuit

6668
01:46:25,350 --> 01:46:25,360
now can you build some kind of a circuit
 

6669
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:26,550
now can you build some kind of a circuit
board which says

6670
01:46:26,550 --> 01:46:26,560
board which says
 

6671
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:28,229
board which says
first candidate number four will play

6672
01:46:28,229 --> 01:46:28,239
first candidate number four will play
 

6673
01:46:28,239 --> 01:46:30,470
first candidate number four will play
against five and see who wins

6674
01:46:30,470 --> 01:46:30,480
against five and see who wins
 

6675
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:33,109
against five and see who wins
and so on okay so now what would be a

6676
01:46:33,109 --> 01:46:33,119
and so on okay so now what would be a
 

6677
01:46:33,119 --> 01:46:33,910
and so on okay so now what would be a
nice

6678
01:46:33,910 --> 01:46:33,920
nice
 

6679
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:35,510
nice
outcome right this is a general question

6680
01:46:35,510 --> 01:46:35,520
outcome right this is a general question
 

6681
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:37,590
outcome right this is a general question
of could i make a big circuit board to

6682
01:46:37,590 --> 01:46:37,600
of could i make a big circuit board to
 

6683
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:39,030
of could i make a big circuit board to
feed an election into

6684
01:46:39,030 --> 01:46:39,040
feed an election into
 

6685
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:40,550
feed an election into
like maybe one nice outcome would be

6686
01:46:40,550 --> 01:46:40,560
like maybe one nice outcome would be
 

6687
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:42,070
like maybe one nice outcome would be
whoever wins at least

6688
01:46:42,070 --> 01:46:42,080
whoever wins at least
 

6689
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:45,189
whoever wins at least
is preferred over a lot of people yes

6690
01:46:45,189 --> 01:46:45,199
is preferred over a lot of people yes
 

6691
01:46:45,199 --> 01:46:47,510
is preferred over a lot of people yes
so for example if you ran in 1024

6692
01:46:47,510 --> 01:46:47,520
so for example if you ran in 1024
 

6693
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:48,470
so for example if you ran in 1024
candidates

6694
01:46:48,470 --> 01:46:48,480
candidates
 

6695
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:50,390
candidates
ideally we would like a guarantee that

6696
01:46:50,390 --> 01:46:50,400
ideally we would like a guarantee that
 

6697
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:52,310
ideally we would like a guarantee that
says that the winner

6698
01:46:52,310 --> 01:46:52,320
says that the winner
 

6699
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:55,910
says that the winner
beats a lot of people actually in any

6700
01:46:55,910 --> 01:46:55,920
beats a lot of people actually in any
 

6701
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:57,590
beats a lot of people actually in any
uh system where there are 1024

6702
01:46:57,590 --> 01:46:57,600
uh system where there are 1024
 

6703
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:59,750
uh system where there are 1024
candidates there's always a candidate

6704
01:46:59,750 --> 01:46:59,760
candidates there's always a candidate
 

6705
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:01,590
candidates there's always a candidate
who beats at least 512

6706
01:47:01,590 --> 01:47:01,600
who beats at least 512
 

6707
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:03,990
who beats at least 512
of the others this is a mathematical

6708
01:47:03,990 --> 01:47:04,000
of the others this is a mathematical
 

6709
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,350
of the others this is a mathematical
fact that there's actually always a

6710
01:47:05,350 --> 01:47:05,360
fact that there's actually always a
 

6711
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:07,030
fact that there's actually always a
person who beats at least half

6712
01:47:07,030 --> 01:47:07,040
person who beats at least half
 

6713
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:11,030
person who beats at least half
of the other people i'm trying to

6714
01:47:11,030 --> 01:47:11,040
of the other people i'm trying to
 

6715
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:13,430
of the other people i'm trying to
make sense of that mathematical fact is

6716
01:47:13,430 --> 01:47:13,440
make sense of that mathematical fact is
 

6717
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:14,709
make sense of that mathematical fact is
this supposed to be obvious

6718
01:47:14,709 --> 01:47:14,719
this supposed to be obvious
 

6719
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:17,910
this supposed to be obvious
uh no but i can explain it no no i can't

6720
01:47:17,910 --> 01:47:17,920
uh no but i can explain it no no i can't
 

6721
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:20,470
uh no but i can explain it no no i can't
the way it works is that think of it

6722
01:47:20,470 --> 01:47:20,480
the way it works is that think of it
 

6723
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:21,350
the way it works is that think of it
this way

6724
01:47:21,350 --> 01:47:21,360
this way
 

6725
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:23,510
this way
every time i i think imagine i have all

6726
01:47:23,510 --> 01:47:23,520
every time i i think imagine i have all
 

6727
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:25,270
every time i i think imagine i have all
these candidates and everyone is

6728
01:47:25,270 --> 01:47:25,280
these candidates and everyone is
 

6729
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:27,430
these candidates and everyone is
competing is everyone is like compared

6730
01:47:27,430 --> 01:47:27,440
competing is everyone is like compared
 

6731
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:29,189
competing is everyone is like compared
with everyone else at some point

6732
01:47:29,189 --> 01:47:29,199
with everyone else at some point
 

6733
01:47:29,199 --> 01:47:30,870
with everyone else at some point
well think of it this way whenever

6734
01:47:30,870 --> 01:47:30,880
well think of it this way whenever
 

6735
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:32,229
well think of it this way whenever
there's a comparison

6736
01:47:32,229 --> 01:47:32,239
there's a comparison
 

6737
01:47:32,239 --> 01:47:35,270
there's a comparison
somebody gets a point that's the one who

6738
01:47:35,270 --> 01:47:35,280
somebody gets a point that's the one who
 

6739
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:37,510
somebody gets a point that's the one who
is better than the other one my claim is

6740
01:47:37,510 --> 01:47:37,520
is better than the other one my claim is
 

6741
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:38,709
is better than the other one my claim is
there's somebody whose

6742
01:47:38,709 --> 01:47:38,719
there's somebody whose
 

6743
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:41,830
there's somebody whose
score is at least half of how many other

6744
01:47:41,830 --> 01:47:41,840
score is at least half of how many other
 

6745
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:42,790
score is at least half of how many other
people there are

6746
01:47:42,790 --> 01:47:42,800
people there are
 

6747
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:45,669
people there are
yeah i'm just trying to like my

6748
01:47:45,669 --> 01:47:45,679
yeah i'm just trying to like my
 

6749
01:47:45,679 --> 01:47:47,270
yeah i'm just trying to like my
intuition is very close to that being

6750
01:47:47,270 --> 01:47:47,280
intuition is very close to that being
 

6751
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:48,550
intuition is very close to that being
true but it's beautiful

6752
01:47:48,550 --> 01:47:48,560
true but it's beautiful
 

6753
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:51,590
true but it's beautiful
i didn't at first that's not an obvious

6754
01:47:51,590 --> 01:47:51,600
i didn't at first that's not an obvious
 

6755
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:52,149
i didn't at first that's not an obvious
fact

6756
01:47:52,149 --> 01:47:52,159
fact
 

6757
01:47:52,159 --> 01:47:54,870
fact
no it's not and it's it feels like a

6758
01:47:54,870 --> 01:47:54,880
no it's not and it's it feels like a
 

6759
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:56,470
no it's not and it's it feels like a
beautiful fact well let me explain it

6760
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:56,480
beautiful fact well let me explain it
 

6761
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:57,189
beautiful fact well let me explain it
this way

6762
01:47:57,189 --> 01:47:57,199
this way
 

6763
01:47:57,199 --> 01:48:00,470
this way
imagine that for every uh match

6764
01:48:00,470 --> 01:48:00,480
imagine that for every uh match
 

6765
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:02,390
imagine that for every uh match
you didn't give one point but you gave

6766
01:48:02,390 --> 01:48:02,400
you didn't give one point but you gave
 

6767
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:03,750
you didn't give one point but you gave
two points

6768
01:48:03,750 --> 01:48:03,760
two points
 

6769
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:05,990
two points
you gave one point to each person now

6770
01:48:05,990 --> 01:48:06,000
you gave one point to each person now
 

6771
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,270
you gave one point to each person now
that's not what we're really doing we

6772
01:48:07,270 --> 01:48:07,280
that's not what we're really doing we
 

6773
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:08,550
that's not what we're really doing we
really want to give one point to the

6774
01:48:08,550 --> 01:48:08,560
really want to give one point to the
 

6775
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:10,709
really want to give one point to the
winner of the match

6776
01:48:10,709 --> 01:48:10,719
winner of the match
 

6777
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:12,470
winner of the match
but instead we'll just give two if you

6778
01:48:12,470 --> 01:48:12,480
but instead we'll just give two if you
 

6779
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:14,149
but instead we'll just give two if you
gave two points to everyone

6780
01:48:14,149 --> 01:48:14,159
gave two points to everyone
 

6781
01:48:14,159 --> 01:48:16,550
gave two points to everyone
on every matchup actually everyone has

6782
01:48:16,550 --> 01:48:16,560
on every matchup actually everyone has
 

6783
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:18,310
on every matchup actually everyone has
the same number of points

6784
01:48:18,310 --> 01:48:18,320
the same number of points
 

6785
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:19,910
the same number of points
and the number of points they get is how

6786
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:19,920
and the number of points they get is how
 

6787
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:22,390
and the number of points they get is how
many other people there are

6788
01:48:22,390 --> 01:48:22,400
many other people there are
 

6789
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:23,750
many other people there are
does that sort of make sense i'm just

6790
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:23,760
does that sort of make sense i'm just
 

6791
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:25,270
does that sort of make sense i'm just
like saying no no everything everything

6792
01:48:25,270 --> 01:48:25,280
like saying no no everything everything
 

6793
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:26,229
like saying no no everything everything
is same makes perfect

6794
01:48:26,229 --> 01:48:26,239
is same makes perfect
 

6795
01:48:26,239 --> 01:48:28,790
is same makes perfect
okay so the point is if for every

6796
01:48:28,790 --> 01:48:28,800
okay so the point is if for every
 

6797
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:30,709
okay so the point is if for every
comparison between two people

6798
01:48:30,709 --> 01:48:30,719
comparison between two people
 

6799
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:32,550
comparison between two people
which i'm doing for every two people i

6800
01:48:32,550 --> 01:48:32,560
which i'm doing for every two people i
 

6801
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:34,390
which i'm doing for every two people i
gave one point to each person

6802
01:48:34,390 --> 01:48:34,400
gave one point to each person
 

6803
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:36,550
gave one point to each person
your score everyone's score is the same

6804
01:48:36,550 --> 01:48:36,560
your score everyone's score is the same
 

6805
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:38,470
your score everyone's score is the same
it's how many other people there are yes

6806
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:38,480
it's how many other people there are yes
 

6807
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:40,629
it's how many other people there are yes
now we only make one change for each

6808
01:48:40,629 --> 01:48:40,639
now we only make one change for each
 

6809
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:41,510
now we only make one change for each
match up

6810
01:48:41,510 --> 01:48:41,520
match up
 

6811
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:44,390
match up
you give one point only to the winner so

6812
01:48:44,390 --> 01:48:44,400
you give one point only to the winner so
 

6813
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:46,950
you give one point only to the winner so
we're awarding half the points

6814
01:48:46,950 --> 01:48:46,960
we're awarding half the points
 

6815
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:49,510
we're awarding half the points
so now the deal is if in the original

6816
01:48:49,510 --> 01:48:49,520
so now the deal is if in the original
 

6817
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:50,229
so now the deal is if in the original
situation

6818
01:48:50,229 --> 01:48:50,239
situation
 

6819
01:48:50,239 --> 01:48:53,109
situation
everyone's score was equal which is how

6820
01:48:53,109 --> 01:48:53,119
everyone's score was equal which is how
 

6821
01:48:53,119 --> 01:48:54,790
everyone's score was equal which is how
many other people there are

6822
01:48:54,790 --> 01:48:54,800
many other people there are
 

6823
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:56,149
many other people there are
now there's only half the number of

6824
01:48:56,149 --> 01:48:56,159
now there's only half the number of
 

6825
01:48:56,159 --> 01:48:58,470
now there's only half the number of
points to go around

6826
01:48:58,470 --> 01:48:58,480
points to go around
 

6827
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:00,950
points to go around
so what ends up happening is that

6828
01:49:00,950 --> 01:49:00,960
so what ends up happening is that
 

6829
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:02,629
so what ends up happening is that
there's always going to be like the

6830
01:49:02,629 --> 01:49:02,639
there's always going to be like the
 

6831
01:49:02,639 --> 01:49:04,629
there's always going to be like the
average number of points per person

6832
01:49:04,629 --> 01:49:04,639
average number of points per person
 

6833
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:06,149
average number of points per person
is going to be half of how many other

6834
01:49:06,149 --> 01:49:06,159
is going to be half of how many other
 

6835
01:49:06,159 --> 01:49:07,830
is going to be half of how many other
people there are and somebody is going

6836
01:49:07,830 --> 01:49:07,840
people there are and somebody is going
 

6837
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:08,390
people there are and somebody is going
to be above

6838
01:49:08,390 --> 01:49:08,400
to be above
 

6839
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:10,790
to be above
somebody's going to be at least average

6840
01:49:10,790 --> 01:49:10,800
somebody's going to be at least average
 

6841
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:12,550
somebody's going to be at least average
yeah this is this notion of expected

6842
01:49:12,550 --> 01:49:12,560
yeah this is this notion of expected
 

6843
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:13,030
yeah this is this notion of expected
value

6844
01:49:13,030 --> 01:49:13,040
value
 

6845
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:14,629
value
that if i have a random variable which

6846
01:49:14,629 --> 01:49:14,639
that if i have a random variable which
 

6847
01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:16,070
that if i have a random variable which
has an expected value

6848
01:49:16,070 --> 01:49:16,080
has an expected value
 

6849
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:17,830
has an expected value
there's going to be some possibility in

6850
01:49:17,830 --> 01:49:17,840
there's going to be some possibility in
 

6851
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:19,189
there's going to be some possibility in
the probability space

6852
01:49:19,189 --> 01:49:19,199
the probability space
 

6853
01:49:19,199 --> 01:49:21,109
the probability space
where you're at least as big as the

6854
01:49:21,109 --> 01:49:21,119
where you're at least as big as the
 

6855
01:49:21,119 --> 01:49:22,629
where you're at least as big as the
expected yeah when you describe it like

6856
01:49:22,629 --> 01:49:22,639
expected yeah when you describe it like
 

6857
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:23,669
expected yeah when you describe it like
that it's obvious

6858
01:49:23,669 --> 01:49:23,679
that it's obvious
 

6859
01:49:23,679 --> 01:49:25,750
that it's obvious
but when you're first saying in this

6860
01:49:25,750 --> 01:49:25,760
but when you're first saying in this
 

6861
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:27,669
but when you're first saying in this
little circuit that there's going to be

6862
01:49:27,669 --> 01:49:27,679
little circuit that there's going to be
 

6863
01:49:27,679 --> 01:49:28,070
little circuit that there's going to be
one

6864
01:49:28,070 --> 01:49:28,080
one
 

6865
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:32,070
one
candidate better than uh than half

6866
01:49:32,070 --> 01:49:32,080
candidate better than uh than half
 

6867
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:35,109
candidate better than uh than half
that's not obvious yeah that's funny

6868
01:49:35,109 --> 01:49:35,119
that's not obvious yeah that's funny
 

6869
01:49:35,119 --> 01:49:38,310
that's not obvious yeah that's funny
math this is nice uh okay so do you have

6870
01:49:38,310 --> 01:49:38,320
math this is nice uh okay so do you have
 

6871
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:39,109
math this is nice uh okay so do you have
this but

6872
01:49:39,109 --> 01:49:39,119
this but
 

6873
01:49:39,119 --> 01:49:41,109
this but
ultimately you want you're trying to

6874
01:49:41,109 --> 01:49:41,119
ultimately you want you're trying to
 

6875
01:49:41,119 --> 01:49:42,709
ultimately you want you're trying to
with the voting tree

6876
01:49:42,709 --> 01:49:42,719
with the voting tree
 

6877
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:44,149
with the voting tree
i don't know if you're trying this but

6878
01:49:44,149 --> 01:49:44,159
i don't know if you're trying this but
 

6879
01:49:44,159 --> 01:49:45,990
i don't know if you're trying this but
uh to have a circuit that's

6880
01:49:45,990 --> 01:49:46,000
uh to have a circuit that's
 

6881
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,030
uh to have a circuit that's
that's like compressed that's small well

6882
01:49:49,030 --> 01:49:49,040
that's like compressed that's small well
 

6883
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:52,709
that's like compressed that's small well
that achieves the the achieves the

6884
01:49:52,709 --> 01:49:52,719
that achieves the the achieves the
 

6885
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:55,910
that achieves the the achieves the
the same kind of um i mean the smaller

6886
01:49:55,910 --> 01:49:55,920
the same kind of um i mean the smaller
 

6887
01:49:55,920 --> 01:49:56,470
the same kind of um i mean the smaller
it is

6888
01:49:56,470 --> 01:49:56,480
it is
 

6889
01:49:56,480 --> 01:49:59,030
it is
the if we look at practically speaking

6890
01:49:59,030 --> 01:49:59,040
the if we look at practically speaking
 

6891
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:00,790
the if we look at practically speaking
the the lower the cost of running the

6892
01:50:00,790 --> 01:50:00,800
the the lower the cost of running the
 

6893
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:01,430
the the lower the cost of running the
election

6894
01:50:01,430 --> 01:50:01,440
election
 

6895
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:03,030
election
of running through of computing the

6896
01:50:03,030 --> 01:50:03,040
of running through of computing the
 

6897
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:04,550
of running through of computing the
circuit that is true

6898
01:50:04,550 --> 01:50:04,560
circuit that is true
 

6899
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:06,629
circuit that is true
but actually at this point the the

6900
01:50:06,629 --> 01:50:06,639
but actually at this point the the
 

6901
01:50:06,639 --> 01:50:08,149
but actually at this point the the
reason the question was interesting

6902
01:50:08,149 --> 01:50:08,159
reason the question was interesting
 

6903
01:50:08,159 --> 01:50:11,589
reason the question was interesting
yes is because the there was no good

6904
01:50:11,589 --> 01:50:11,599
yes is because the there was no good
 

6905
01:50:11,599 --> 01:50:12,790
yes is because the there was no good
guarantee

6906
01:50:12,790 --> 01:50:12,800
guarantee
 

6907
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:15,750
guarantee
that the winner of that circuit would

6908
01:50:15,750 --> 01:50:15,760
that the winner of that circuit would
 

6909
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:16,870
that the winner of that circuit would
have

01:50:16,870 --> 01:50:16,880
have
 

6911
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:18,550
have
like have beaten a lot of people let me

6912
01:50:18,550 --> 01:50:18,560
like have beaten a lot of people let me
 

6913
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:20,709
like have beaten a lot of people let me
give an example the best known circuit

6914
01:50:20,709 --> 01:50:20,719
give an example the best known circuit
 

6915
01:50:20,719 --> 01:50:22,310
give an example the best known circuit
when we started thinking about this

6916
01:50:22,310 --> 01:50:22,320
when we started thinking about this
 

6917
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:24,709
when we started thinking about this
was the circuit called candidate one

6918
01:50:24,709 --> 01:50:24,719
was the circuit called candidate one
 

6919
01:50:24,719 --> 01:50:26,310
was the circuit called candidate one
plays against candidate two

6920
01:50:26,310 --> 01:50:26,320
plays against candidate two
 

6921
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:28,629
plays against candidate two
candidate three plays against four and

6922
01:50:28,629 --> 01:50:28,639
candidate three plays against four and
 

6923
01:50:28,639 --> 01:50:30,390
candidate three plays against four and
then the winners play against each other

6924
01:50:30,390 --> 01:50:30,400
then the winners play against each other
 

6925
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:31,910
then the winners play against each other
and then by the way five plays against

6926
01:50:31,910 --> 01:50:31,920
and then by the way five plays against
 

6927
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:33,510
and then by the way five plays against
six seven against eight

6928
01:50:33,510 --> 01:50:33,520
six seven against eight
 

6929
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:34,709
six seven against eight
the winners play against each other you

6930
01:50:34,709 --> 01:50:34,719
the winners play against each other you
 

6931
01:50:34,719 --> 01:50:36,310
the winners play against each other you
understand it's like a giant binary tree

6932
01:50:36,310 --> 01:50:36,320
understand it's like a giant binary tree
 

6933
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:38,149
understand it's like a giant binary tree
where yeah the binary like a balanced

6934
01:50:38,149 --> 01:50:38,159
where yeah the binary like a balanced
 

6935
01:50:38,159 --> 01:50:39,030
where yeah the binary like a balanced
binary tree

6936
01:50:39,030 --> 01:50:39,040
binary tree
 

6937
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:41,189
binary tree
okay it's a balanced binary tree one two

6938
01:50:41,189 --> 01:50:41,199
okay it's a balanced binary tree one two
 

6939
01:50:41,199 --> 01:50:42,629
okay it's a balanced binary tree one two
three four up two thousand twenty four

everyone going up to find the winner
 

6943
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:45,510
everyone going up to find the winner
beautiful well you know what

6944
01:50:45,510 --> 01:50:45,520
beautiful well you know what
 

6945
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:48,550
beautiful well you know what
there's a system in the world where it

6946
01:50:48,550 --> 01:50:48,560
there's a system in the world where it
 

6947
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:49,669
there's a system in the world where it
could just be

6948
01:50:49,669 --> 01:50:49,679
could just be
 

6949
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:51,350
could just be
that there's a candidate called number

6950
01:50:51,350 --> 01:50:51,360
that there's a candidate called number
 

6951
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:53,510
that there's a candidate called number
one that just beats

6952
01:50:53,510 --> 01:50:53,520
one that just beats
 

6953
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:57,270
one that just beats
like 10 other people just the 10 that

6954
01:50:57,270 --> 01:50:57,280
like 10 other people just the 10 that
 

6955
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:58,149
like 10 other people just the 10 that
they need to be

6956
01:50:58,149 --> 01:50:58,159
they need to be
 

6957
01:50:58,159 --> 01:51:00,390
they need to be
on their way up and they lose to

6958
01:51:00,390 --> 01:51:00,400
on their way up and they lose to
 

6959
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:02,149
on their way up and they lose to
everyone else

6960
01:51:02,149 --> 01:51:02,159
everyone else
 

6961
01:51:02,159 --> 01:51:03,750
everyone else
but somehow they would get all the way

6962
01:51:03,750 --> 01:51:03,760
but somehow they would get all the way
 

6963
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:05,350
but somehow they would get all the way
up yes my point is

6964
01:51:05,350 --> 01:51:05,360
up yes my point is
 

6965
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:08,870
up yes my point is
it is possible to outsmart

6966
01:51:08,870 --> 01:51:08,880
it is possible to outsmart
 

6967
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:11,990
it is possible to outsmart
that circuit in one

6968
01:51:11,990 --> 01:51:12,000
that circuit in one
 

6969
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,310
that circuit in one
weird way of the world which makes that

6970
01:51:14,310 --> 01:51:14,320
weird way of the world which makes that
 

6971
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:15,910
weird way of the world which makes that
circuit a bad one because you want to

6972
01:51:15,910 --> 01:51:15,920
circuit a bad one because you want to
 

6973
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:17,589
circuit a bad one because you want to
say i will use this circuit for all

6974
01:51:17,589 --> 01:51:17,599
say i will use this circuit for all
 

6975
01:51:17,599 --> 01:51:18,870
say i will use this circuit for all
elections

6976
01:51:18,870 --> 01:51:18,880
elections
 

6977
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:21,109
elections
and you might have a system of inputs

6978
01:51:21,109 --> 01:51:21,119
and you might have a system of inputs
 

6979
01:51:21,119 --> 01:51:22,390
and you might have a system of inputs
that go in there

6980
01:51:22,390 --> 01:51:22,400
that go in there
 

6981
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:24,390
that go in there
where the winner only beat 10 other

6982
01:51:24,390 --> 01:51:24,400
where the winner only beat 10 other
 

6983
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:25,669
where the winner only beat 10 other
people which is the people they had to

6984
01:51:25,669 --> 01:51:25,679
people which is the people they had to
 

6985
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:26,629
people which is the people they had to
beat on the way up

6986
01:51:26,629 --> 01:51:26,639
beat on the way up
 

6987
01:51:26,639 --> 01:51:27,990
beat on the way up
so you want to have a circuit where

6988
01:51:27,990 --> 01:51:28,000
so you want to have a circuit where
 

6989
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,109
so you want to have a circuit where
there's as many like the final result

6990
01:51:31,109 --> 01:51:31,119
there's as many like the final result
 

6991
01:51:31,119 --> 01:51:34,149
there's as many like the final result
is as strong as possible yes

6992
01:51:34,149 --> 01:51:34,159
is as strong as possible yes
 

6993
01:51:34,159 --> 01:51:37,030
is as strong as possible yes
and so what what ideas do you have for

6994
01:51:37,030 --> 01:51:37,040
and so what what ideas do you have for
 

6995
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:37,350
and so what what ideas do you have for
that

6996
01:51:37,350 --> 01:51:37,360
that
 

6997
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:39,990
that
so um we actually only managed to

6998
01:51:39,990 --> 01:51:40,000
so um we actually only managed to
 

6999
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,669
so um we actually only managed to
improve it to square root of n

7000
01:51:41,669 --> 01:51:41,679
improve it to square root of n
 

7001
01:51:41,679 --> 01:51:44,070
improve it to square root of n
so if n is the number of vertices n over

7002
01:51:44,070 --> 01:51:44,080
so if n is the number of vertices n over
 

7003
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:45,990
so if n is the number of vertices n over
two would be the ideal

7004
01:51:45,990 --> 01:51:46,000
two would be the ideal
 

7005
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,510
two would be the ideal
we got it to and we got the square root

7006
01:51:47,510 --> 01:51:47,520
we got it to and we got the square root
 

7007
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:49,109
we got it to and we got the square root
of n versus

7008
01:51:49,109 --> 01:51:49,119
of n versus
 

7009
01:51:49,119 --> 01:51:52,310
of n versus
log base two yeah exactly yeah

7010
01:51:52,310 --> 01:51:52,320
log base two yeah exactly yeah
 

7011
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:54,550
log base two yeah exactly yeah
which is well that is happening it could

7012
01:51:54,550 --> 01:51:54,560
which is well that is happening it could
 

7013
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:55,750
which is well that is happening it could
be a lot

7014
01:51:55,750 --> 01:51:55,760
be a lot
 

7015
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:57,830
be a lot
yeah it could be a big improvement so

7016
01:51:57,830 --> 01:51:57,840
yeah it could be a big improvement so
 

7017
01:51:57,840 --> 01:51:58,950
yeah it could be a big improvement so
that's uh okay cool

7018
01:51:58,950 --> 01:51:58,960
that's uh okay cool
 

7019
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:01,109
that's uh okay cool
is there something you can say with

7020
01:52:01,109 --> 01:52:01,119
is there something you can say with
 

7021
01:52:01,119 --> 01:52:01,990
is there something you can say with
words about what

7022
01:52:01,990 --> 01:52:02,000
words about what
 

7023
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,629
words about what
kind of circuit what that looks like i

7024
01:52:04,629 --> 01:52:04,639
kind of circuit what that looks like i
 

7025
01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:05,510
kind of circuit what that looks like i
can give an

7026
01:52:05,510 --> 01:52:05,520
can give an
 

7027
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:08,070
can give an
idea of one of the tools inside yeah but

7028
01:52:08,070 --> 01:52:08,080
idea of one of the tools inside yeah but
 

7029
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:09,669
idea of one of the tools inside yeah but
the actual execution ends up being more

7030
01:52:09,669 --> 01:52:09,679
the actual execution ends up being more
 

7031
01:52:09,679 --> 01:52:10,390
the actual execution ends up being more
complicated

7032
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:10,400
complicated
 

7033
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:13,669
complicated
but one of the widgets inside this is

7034
01:52:13,669 --> 01:52:13,679
but one of the widgets inside this is
 

7035
01:52:13,679 --> 01:52:16,070
but one of the widgets inside this is
building a system where you have like a

7036
01:52:16,070 --> 01:52:16,080
building a system where you have like a
 

7037
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:16,870
building a system where you have like a
candidate

7038
01:52:16,870 --> 01:52:16,880
candidate
 

7039
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:19,750
candidate
who plays like the one part of the whole

7040
01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:19,760
who plays like the one part of the whole
 

7041
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:21,270
who plays like the one part of the whole
huge huge tree is that

7042
01:52:21,270 --> 01:52:21,280
huge huge tree is that
 

7043
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:23,270
huge huge tree is that
that same candidate let's column seven

7044
01:52:23,270 --> 01:52:23,280
that same candidate let's column seven
 

7045
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:24,790
that same candidate let's column seven
seven plays against

7046
01:52:24,790 --> 01:52:24,800
seven plays against
 

7047
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:26,390
seven plays against
somebody let's let's pick up some

7048
01:52:26,390 --> 01:52:26,400
somebody let's let's pick up some
 

7049
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:27,430
somebody let's let's pick up some
numbers let's call the others like

7050
01:52:27,430 --> 01:52:27,440
numbers let's call the others like
 

7051
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:30,629
numbers let's call the others like
letters so seven plays against a

7052
01:52:30,629 --> 01:52:30,639
letters so seven plays against a
 

7053
01:52:30,639 --> 01:52:32,149
letters so seven plays against a
seven is also going to play against b

7054
01:52:32,149 --> 01:52:32,159
seven is also going to play against b
 

7055
01:52:32,159 --> 01:52:34,629
seven is also going to play against b
separately and the winners of each of

7056
01:52:34,629 --> 01:52:34,639
separately and the winners of each of
 

7057
01:52:34,639 --> 01:52:36,470
separately and the winners of each of
those will play each other

7058
01:52:36,470 --> 01:52:36,480
those will play each other
 

7059
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:38,390
those will play each other
by the way seven's also going to play c

7060
01:52:38,390 --> 01:52:38,400
by the way seven's also going to play c
 

7061
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:39,510
by the way seven's also going to play c
seven's going to play d

7062
01:52:39,510 --> 01:52:39,520
seven's going to play d
 

7063
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:40,629
seven's going to play d
and the winners are going to play each

7064
01:52:40,629 --> 01:52:40,639
and the winners are going to play each
 

7065
01:52:40,639 --> 01:52:41,830
and the winners are going to play each
other and the winners are going to play

7066
01:52:41,830 --> 01:52:41,840
other and the winners are going to play
 

7067
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:43,189
other and the winners are going to play
each other we call this

7068
01:52:43,189 --> 01:52:43,199
each other we call this
 

7069
01:52:43,199 --> 01:52:45,589
each other we call this
seven against all well seven against

7070
01:52:45,589 --> 01:52:45,599
seven against all well seven against
 

7071
01:52:45,599 --> 01:52:47,589
seven against all well seven against
like everyone from a bunch of

7072
01:52:47,589 --> 01:52:47,599
like everyone from a bunch of
 

7073
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:49,510
like everyone from a bunch of
got it so there's some nice overlap

7074
01:52:49,510 --> 01:52:49,520
got it so there's some nice overlap
 

7075
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:50,709
got it so there's some nice overlap
between the matchups

7076
01:52:50,709 --> 01:52:50,719
between the matchups
 

7077
01:52:50,719 --> 01:52:52,790
between the matchups
yeah that somehow has a nice feature to

7078
01:52:52,790 --> 01:52:52,800
yeah that somehow has a nice feature to
 

7079
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:53,830
yeah that somehow has a nice feature to
it yes and i can tell you the nice

7080
01:52:53,830 --> 01:52:53,840
it yes and i can tell you the nice
 

7081
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:55,669
it yes and i can tell you the nice
feature because if at the base of this

7082
01:52:55,669 --> 01:52:55,679
feature because if at the base of this
 

7083
01:52:55,679 --> 01:52:56,550
feature because if at the base of this
giant tree

7084
01:52:56,550 --> 01:52:56,560
giant tree
 

7085
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:57,910
giant tree
at the base of this giant circuit like

7086
01:52:57,910 --> 01:52:57,920
at the base of this giant circuit like
 

7087
01:52:57,920 --> 01:52:59,350
at the base of this giant circuit like
this is a widget you rebuild the things

7088
01:52:59,350 --> 01:52:59,360
this is a widget you rebuild the things
 

7089
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:00,470
this is a widget you rebuild the things
out of widgets so i'm just describing

7090
01:53:00,470 --> 01:53:00,480
out of widgets so i'm just describing
 

7091
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:01,270
out of widgets so i'm just describing
one widget

7092
01:53:01,270 --> 01:53:01,280
one widget
 

7093
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:03,669
one widget
but in the base of this widget you have

7094
01:53:03,669 --> 01:53:03,679
but in the base of this widget you have
 

7095
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:05,109
but in the base of this widget you have
lots of things which are seven against

7096
01:53:05,109 --> 01:53:05,119
lots of things which are seven against
 

7097
01:53:05,119 --> 01:53:06,629
lots of things which are seven against
someone seven against someone seven

7098
01:53:06,629 --> 01:53:06,639
someone seven against someone seven
 

7099
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:07,830
someone seven against someone seven
against someone in fact

7100
01:53:07,830 --> 01:53:07,840
against someone in fact
 

7101
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:10,229
against someone in fact
every match up at the bottom is seven

7102
01:53:10,229 --> 01:53:10,239
every match up at the bottom is seven
 

7103
01:53:10,239 --> 01:53:11,430
every match up at the bottom is seven
against someone

7104
01:53:11,430 --> 01:53:11,440
against someone
 

7105
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:14,470
against someone
what that means is

7106
01:53:14,470 --> 01:53:14,480
what that means is
 

7107
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:17,430
what that means is
if 7 actually beat everyone they were

7108
01:53:17,430 --> 01:53:17,440
if 7 actually beat everyone they were
 

7109
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:19,189
if 7 actually beat everyone they were
matched up against well 7 would rise to

7110
01:53:19,189 --> 01:53:19,199
matched up against well 7 would rise to
 

7111
01:53:19,199 --> 01:53:20,229
matched up against well 7 would rise to
the top

7112
01:53:20,229 --> 01:53:20,239
the top
 

7113
01:53:20,239 --> 01:53:22,790
the top
so one possibility is if you see a 7

7114
01:53:22,790 --> 01:53:22,800
so one possibility is if you see a 7
 

7115
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:23,830
so one possibility is if you see a 7
emerge from the top

7116
01:53:23,830 --> 01:53:23,840
emerge from the top
 

7117
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:25,750
emerge from the top
you know that 7 actually beat every one

7118
01:53:25,750 --> 01:53:25,760
you know that 7 actually beat every one
 

7119
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,350
you know that 7 actually beat every one
they were against

7120
01:53:27,350 --> 01:53:27,360
they were against
 

7121
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:29,109
they were against
on the other hand if anyone else is on

7122
01:53:29,109 --> 01:53:29,119
on the other hand if anyone else is on
 

7123
01:53:29,119 --> 01:53:30,709
on the other hand if anyone else is on
top let's call it

7124
01:53:30,709 --> 01:53:30,719
top let's call it
 

7125
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:33,430
top let's call it
f if f is on top how did f get there

7126
01:53:33,430 --> 01:53:33,440
f if f is on top how did f get there
 

7127
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:34,870
f if f is on top how did f get there
well f beats seven on the way at the

7128
01:53:34,870 --> 01:53:34,880
well f beats seven on the way at the
 

7129
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:36,229
well f beats seven on the way at the
beginning

7130
01:53:36,229 --> 01:53:36,239
beginning
 

7131
01:53:36,239 --> 01:53:38,149
beginning
so the point is the outcome of this

7132
01:53:38,149 --> 01:53:38,159
so the point is the outcome of this
 

7133
01:53:38,159 --> 01:53:40,070
so the point is the outcome of this
circuit has a certain property

7134
01:53:40,070 --> 01:53:40,080
circuit has a certain property
 

7135
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:41,750
circuit has a certain property
if you see a seven you know that the

7136
01:53:41,750 --> 01:53:41,760
if you see a seven you know that the
 

7137
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:43,830
if you see a seven you know that the
seven actually be the brazilian people

7138
01:53:43,830 --> 01:53:43,840
seven actually be the brazilian people
 

7139
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:45,589
seven actually be the brazilian people
if you see anyone else at least you know

7140
01:53:45,589 --> 01:53:45,599
if you see anyone else at least you know
 

7141
01:53:45,599 --> 01:53:46,950
if you see anyone else at least you know
they beat seven

7142
01:53:46,950 --> 01:53:46,960
they beat seven
 

7143
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:48,870
they beat seven
yeah then you can prove that it has a

7144
01:53:48,870 --> 01:53:48,880
yeah then you can prove that it has a
 

7145
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:50,790
yeah then you can prove that it has a
nice property that's really interesting

7146
01:53:50,790 --> 01:53:50,800
nice property that's really interesting
 

7147
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:53,990
nice property that's really interesting
is there something you can say

7148
01:53:53,990 --> 01:53:54,000
is there something you can say
 

7149
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,830
is there something you can say
perhaps going completely outside of what

7150
01:53:55,830 --> 01:53:55,840
perhaps going completely outside of what
 

7151
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:57,109
perhaps going completely outside of what
we're talking about is

7152
01:53:57,109 --> 01:53:57,119
we're talking about is
 

7153
01:53:57,119 --> 01:54:00,790
we're talking about is
uh how we may um

7154
01:54:00,790 --> 01:54:00,800
uh how we may um
 

7155
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:04,470
uh how we may um
have mathematical ideas of improving

7156
01:54:04,470 --> 01:54:04,480
have mathematical ideas of improving
 

7157
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:07,430
have mathematical ideas of improving
the electoral process that one no no i

7158
01:54:07,430 --> 01:54:07,440
the electoral process that one no no i
 

7159
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:08,950
the electoral process that one no no i
can't give you that one

7160
01:54:08,950 --> 01:54:08,960
can't give you that one
 

7161
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:11,109
can't give you that one
i mean is there like do you ever see it

7162
01:54:11,109 --> 01:54:11,119
i mean is there like do you ever see it
 

7163
01:54:11,119 --> 01:54:13,270
i mean is there like do you ever see it
as um

7164
01:54:13,270 --> 01:54:13,280
as um
 

7165
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:15,750
as um
as as there be do you see is there being

7166
01:54:15,750 --> 01:54:15,760
as as there be do you see is there being
 

7167
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:17,350
as as there be do you see is there being
a lot of opportunities

7168
01:54:17,350 --> 01:54:17,360
a lot of opportunities
 

7169
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:20,390
a lot of opportunities
for improving how we vote uh

7170
01:54:20,390 --> 01:54:20,400
for improving how we vote uh
 

7171
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:23,030
for improving how we vote uh
like from your i i don't know if you saw

7172
01:54:23,030 --> 01:54:23,040
like from your i i don't know if you saw
 

7173
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:24,709
like from your i i don't know if you saw
parallels but

7174
01:54:24,709 --> 01:54:24,719
parallels but
 

7175
01:54:24,719 --> 01:54:27,030
parallels but
you know it seems like if this actually

7176
01:54:27,030 --> 01:54:27,040
you know it seems like if this actually
 

7177
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:27,990
you know it seems like if this actually
kind of maps to your

7178
01:54:27,990 --> 01:54:28,000
kind of maps to your
 

7179
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,310
kind of maps to your
sort of covid work which is there's a

7180
01:54:30,310 --> 01:54:30,320
sort of covid work which is there's a
 

7181
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:31,510
sort of covid work which is there's a
network effect

7182
01:54:31,510 --> 01:54:31,520
network effect
 

7183
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:33,910
network effect
right it seems like we should be able to

7184
01:54:33,910 --> 01:54:33,920
right it seems like we should be able to
 

7185
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:35,510
right it seems like we should be able to
apply similar kind of effects

7186
01:54:35,510 --> 01:54:35,520
apply similar kind of effects
 

7187
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:38,790
apply similar kind of effects
of how we decide other things in our

7188
01:54:38,790 --> 01:54:38,800
of how we decide other things in our
 

7189
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:39,350
of how we decide other things in our
lives

7190
01:54:39,350 --> 01:54:39,360
lives
 

7191
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:42,070
lives
and and one of the big decisions we make

7192
01:54:42,070 --> 01:54:42,080
and and one of the big decisions we make
 

7193
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:44,310
and and one of the big decisions we make
is who represents us in government

7194
01:54:44,310 --> 01:54:44,320
is who represents us in government
 

7195
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:45,350
is who represents us in government
do you ever think about like

7196
01:54:45,350 --> 01:54:45,360
do you ever think about like
 

7197
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:47,189
do you ever think about like
mathematically about those kinds of

7198
01:54:47,189 --> 01:54:47,199
mathematically about those kinds of
 

7199
01:54:47,199 --> 01:54:48,070
mathematically about those kinds of
systems

7200
01:54:48,070 --> 01:54:48,080
systems
 

7201
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:49,990
systems
i think a little bit about those because

7202
01:54:49,990 --> 01:54:50,000
i think a little bit about those because
 

7203
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,350
i think a little bit about those because
where i went to college

7204
01:54:51,350 --> 01:54:51,360
where i went to college
 

7205
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:53,030
where i went to college
the way we voted for student government

7206
01:54:53,030 --> 01:54:53,040
the way we voted for student government
 

7207
01:54:53,040 --> 01:54:54,709
the way we voted for student government
was based on this

7208
01:54:54,709 --> 01:54:54,719
was based on this
 

7209
01:54:54,719 --> 01:54:56,229
was based on this
is it called ranked choice where you're

7210
01:54:56,229 --> 01:54:56,239
is it called ranked choice where you're
 

7211
01:54:56,239 --> 01:54:58,470
is it called ranked choice where you're
eliminated you eliminate the bottom

7212
01:54:58,470 --> 01:54:58,480
eliminated you eliminate the bottom
 

7213
01:54:58,480 --> 01:55:01,270
eliminated you eliminate the bottom
and there's runoff elections so so i

7214
01:55:01,270 --> 01:55:01,280
and there's runoff elections so so i
 

7215
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:02,709
and there's runoff elections so so i
that was the first time i ever saw that

7216
01:55:02,709 --> 01:55:02,719
that was the first time i ever saw that
 

7217
01:55:02,719 --> 01:55:04,070
that was the first time i ever saw that
and i thought that made sense

7218
01:55:04,070 --> 01:55:04,080
and i thought that made sense
 

7219
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:06,229
and i thought that made sense
yeah the only problem is it doesn't seem

7220
01:55:06,229 --> 01:55:06,239
yeah the only problem is it doesn't seem
 

7221
01:55:06,239 --> 01:55:07,750
yeah the only problem is it doesn't seem
so easy to get something that makes

7222
01:55:07,750 --> 01:55:07,760
so easy to get something that makes
 

7223
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:09,669
so easy to get something that makes
sense adopted as the new voting system

7224
01:55:09,669 --> 01:55:09,679
sense adopted as the new voting system
 

7225
01:55:09,679 --> 01:55:11,750
sense adopted as the new voting system
that's a whole nother there's that's not

7226
01:55:11,750 --> 01:55:11,760
that's a whole nother there's that's not
 

7227
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:13,750
that's a whole nother there's that's not
a math solution that's uh

7228
01:55:13,750 --> 01:55:13,760
a math solution that's uh
 

7229
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:15,669
a math solution that's uh
well it's math and sentences game

7230
01:55:15,669 --> 01:55:15,679
well it's math and sentences game
 

7231
01:55:15,679 --> 01:55:16,709
well it's math and sentences game
theories you have to come up with

7232
01:55:16,709 --> 01:55:16,719
theories you have to come up with
 

7233
01:55:16,719 --> 01:55:18,390
theories you have to come up with
incentive it's mechanism design you have

7234
01:55:18,390 --> 01:55:18,400
incentive it's mechanism design you have
 

7235
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:19,830
incentive it's mechanism design you have
to figure out how to

7236
01:55:19,830 --> 01:55:19,840
to figure out how to
 

7237
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:23,830
to figure out how to
trick us despite our basic human nature

7238
01:55:23,830 --> 01:55:23,840
trick us despite our basic human nature
 

7239
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:27,109
trick us despite our basic human nature
uh to adopt uh solutions that are better

7240
01:55:27,109 --> 01:55:27,119
uh to adopt uh solutions that are better
 

7241
01:55:27,119 --> 01:55:28,870
uh to adopt uh solutions that are better
yeah that's a whole other conversation i

7242
01:55:28,870 --> 01:55:28,880
yeah that's a whole other conversation i
 

7243
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:30,390
yeah that's a whole other conversation i
think um

7244
01:55:30,390 --> 01:55:30,400
think um
 

7245
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:32,229
think um
can you just because it sounded really

7246
01:55:32,229 --> 01:55:32,239
can you just because it sounded really
 

7247
01:55:32,239 --> 01:55:34,149
can you just because it sounded really
cool uh talk a little bit about

7248
01:55:34,149 --> 01:55:34,159
cool uh talk a little bit about
 

7249
01:55:34,159 --> 01:55:36,070
cool uh talk a little bit about
stochastic coalescence

7250
01:55:36,070 --> 01:55:36,080
stochastic coalescence
 

7251
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:39,350
stochastic coalescence
and uh you have a paper on showing that

7252
01:55:39,350 --> 01:55:39,360
and uh you have a paper on showing that
 

7253
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:41,030
and uh you have a paper on showing that
something you describe what it is but i

7254
01:55:41,030 --> 01:55:41,040
something you describe what it is but i
 

7255
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:43,270
something you describe what it is but i
guess it's a super linear

7256
01:55:43,270 --> 01:55:43,280
guess it's a super linear
 

7257
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:45,430
guess it's a super linear
super logarithmic time and you came up

7258
01:55:45,430 --> 01:55:45,440
super logarithmic time and you came up
 

7259
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:46,790
super logarithmic time and you came up
with some kind of trick to make it

7260
01:55:46,790 --> 01:55:46,800
with some kind of trick to make it
 

7261
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:47,589
with some kind of trick to make it
faster

7262
01:55:47,589 --> 01:55:47,599
faster
 

7263
01:55:47,599 --> 01:55:48,950
faster
just can you just talk about it a little

7264
01:55:48,950 --> 01:55:48,960
just can you just talk about it a little
 

7265
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:50,709
just can you just talk about it a little
bit yeah so this was something which

7266
01:55:50,709 --> 01:55:50,719
bit yeah so this was something which
 

7267
01:55:50,719 --> 01:55:51,510
bit yeah so this was something which
came up

7268
01:55:51,510 --> 01:55:51,520
came up
 

7269
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:53,350
came up
when i was at microsoft research for a

7270
01:55:53,350 --> 01:55:53,360
when i was at microsoft research for a
 

7271
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:55,830
when i was at microsoft research for a
summer and that i'm putting that context

7272
01:55:55,830 --> 01:55:55,840
summer and that i'm putting that context
 

7273
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:57,669
summer and that i'm putting that context
because that shows that it has some

7274
01:55:57,669 --> 01:55:57,679
because that shows that it has some
 

7275
01:55:57,679 --> 01:56:00,950
because that shows that it has some
practical motivation at some point

7276
01:56:00,950 --> 01:56:00,960
practical motivation at some point
 

7277
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:02,149
practical motivation at some point
actually i think it still it doesn't

7278
01:56:02,149 --> 01:56:02,159
actually i think it still it doesn't
 

7279
01:56:02,159 --> 01:56:03,830
actually i think it still it doesn't
need to yeah it doesn't need to it could

7280
01:56:03,830 --> 01:56:03,840
need to yeah it doesn't need to it could
 

7281
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:05,510
need to yeah it doesn't need to it could
be beautiful and it's all right yeah

7282
01:56:05,510 --> 01:56:05,520
be beautiful and it's all right yeah
 

7283
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:07,270
be beautiful and it's all right yeah
so the easiest way to describe this is

7284
01:56:07,270 --> 01:56:07,280
so the easiest way to describe this is
 

7285
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:08,950
so the easiest way to describe this is
suppose you got like a big crowd of

7286
01:56:08,950 --> 01:56:08,960
suppose you got like a big crowd of
 

7287
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:09,830
suppose you got like a big crowd of
people

7288
01:56:09,830 --> 01:56:09,840
people
 

7289
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:11,750
people
and everybody knows how many hours of

7290
01:56:11,750 --> 01:56:11,760
and everybody knows how many hours of
 

7291
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:13,189
and everybody knows how many hours of
sleep they got last night

7292
01:56:13,189 --> 01:56:13,199
sleep they got last night
 

7293
01:56:13,199 --> 01:56:14,470
sleep they got last night
and you want to know how many total

7294
01:56:14,470 --> 01:56:14,480
and you want to know how many total
 

7295
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:16,390
and you want to know how many total
hours of sleep were gotten by this big

7296
01:56:16,390 --> 01:56:16,400
hours of sleep were gotten by this big
 

7297
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:18,229
hours of sleep were gotten by this big
big crowd of people at the beginning you

7298
01:56:18,229 --> 01:56:18,239
big crowd of people at the beginning you
 

7299
01:56:18,239 --> 01:56:19,910
big crowd of people at the beginning you
might say that sounds like a linear time

7300
01:56:19,910 --> 01:56:19,920
might say that sounds like a linear time
 

7301
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:20,629
might say that sounds like a linear time
algorithm

7302
01:56:20,629 --> 01:56:20,639
algorithm
 

7303
01:56:20,639 --> 01:56:22,629
algorithm
of saying hey you how many hours you got

7304
01:56:22,629 --> 01:56:22,639
of saying hey you how many hours you got
 

7305
01:56:22,639 --> 01:56:24,149
of saying hey you how many hours you got
how many you got how many you got add

7306
01:56:24,149 --> 01:56:24,159
how many you got how many you got add
 

7307
01:56:24,159 --> 01:56:25,430
how many you got how many you got add
add add yes

7308
01:56:25,430 --> 01:56:25,440
add add yes
 

7309
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:27,189
add add yes
but there's a way to do this if you

7310
01:56:27,189 --> 01:56:27,199
but there's a way to do this if you
 

7311
01:56:27,199 --> 01:56:28,870
but there's a way to do this if you
remember that there are people and they

7312
01:56:28,870 --> 01:56:28,880
remember that there are people and they
 

7313
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:30,310
remember that there are people and they
presumably know how to add

7314
01:56:30,310 --> 01:56:30,320
presumably know how to add
 

7315
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:32,070
presumably know how to add
you could make a distributed algorithm

7316
01:56:32,070 --> 01:56:32,080
you could make a distributed algorithm
 

7317
01:56:32,080 --> 01:56:33,350
you could make a distributed algorithm
to make this happen

7318
01:56:33,350 --> 01:56:33,360
to make this happen
 

7319
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:34,709
to make this happen
for example while we're thinking of

7320
01:56:34,709 --> 01:56:34,719
for example while we're thinking of
 

7321
01:56:34,719 --> 01:56:38,470
for example while we're thinking of
these trees imagine you had 1024 people

7322
01:56:38,470 --> 01:56:38,480
these trees imagine you had 1024 people
 

7323
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:40,470
these trees imagine you had 1024 people
if you could just say hey person number

7324
01:56:40,470 --> 01:56:40,480
if you could just say hey person number
 

7325
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:42,629
if you could just say hey person number
one and person number two you will add

7326
01:56:42,629 --> 01:56:42,639
one and person number two you will add
 

7327
01:56:42,639 --> 01:56:44,790
one and person number two you will add
your hours of sleep

7328
01:56:44,790 --> 01:56:44,800
your hours of sleep
 

7329
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:46,070
your hours of sleep
person number two will go away and

7330
01:56:46,070 --> 01:56:46,080
person number two will go away and
 

7331
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:47,350
person number two will go away and
person number one is going to remember

7332
01:56:47,350 --> 01:56:47,360
person number one is going to remember
 

7333
01:56:47,360 --> 01:56:48,310
person number one is going to remember
the sum

7334
01:56:48,310 --> 01:56:48,320
the sum
 

7335
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:51,350
the sum
person three and four add up and person

7336
01:56:51,350 --> 01:56:51,360
person three and four add up and person
 

7337
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:53,589
person three and four add up and person
three takes charge of remembering it

7338
01:56:53,589 --> 01:56:53,599
three takes charge of remembering it
 

7339
01:56:53,599 --> 01:56:55,350
three takes charge of remembering it
person four goes away now this like

7340
01:56:55,350 --> 01:56:55,360
person four goes away now this like
 

7341
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:56,870
person four goes away now this like
person one knows the sum of these two

7342
01:56:56,870 --> 01:56:56,880
person one knows the sum of these two
 

7343
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:58,149
person one knows the sum of these two
person three knows some of those two

7344
01:56:58,149 --> 01:56:58,159
person three knows some of those two
 

7345
01:56:58,159 --> 01:56:58,790
person three knows some of those two
they talk

7346
01:56:58,790 --> 01:56:58,800
they talk
 

7347
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:00,229
they talk
you see what i mean it's like you're

7348
01:57:00,229 --> 01:57:00,239
you see what i mean it's like you're
 

7349
01:57:00,239 --> 01:57:02,149
you see what i mean it's like you're
going up this tree

7350
01:57:02,149 --> 01:57:02,159
going up this tree
 

7351
01:57:02,159 --> 01:57:03,350
going up this tree
same tree that we've talked about

7352
01:57:03,350 --> 01:57:03,360
same tree that we've talked about
 

7353
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:05,109
same tree that we've talked about
earlier built up a tree from the bottom

7354
01:57:05,109 --> 01:57:05,119
earlier built up a tree from the bottom
 

7355
01:57:05,119 --> 01:57:05,830
earlier built up a tree from the bottom
up

7356
01:57:05,830 --> 01:57:05,840
up
 

7357
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:07,510
up
yeah build a retreat from the bottom up

7358
01:57:07,510 --> 01:57:07,520
yeah build a retreat from the bottom up
 

7359
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:09,109
yeah build a retreat from the bottom up
and the beautiful thing is

7360
01:57:09,109 --> 01:57:09,119
and the beautiful thing is
 

7361
01:57:09,119 --> 01:57:11,270
and the beautiful thing is
since everyone's doing stuff in parallel

7362
01:57:11,270 --> 01:57:11,280
since everyone's doing stuff in parallel
 

7363
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:12,870
since everyone's doing stuff in parallel
the amount of time it takes

7364
01:57:12,870 --> 01:57:12,880
the amount of time it takes
 

7365
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:15,270
the amount of time it takes
to get the total sum is actually just

7366
01:57:15,270 --> 01:57:15,280
to get the total sum is actually just
 

7367
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:17,270
to get the total sum is actually just
the number of layers in the tree

7368
01:57:17,270 --> 01:57:17,280
the number of layers in the tree
 

7369
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:19,990
the number of layers in the tree
which is 10. so now that's logarithmic

7370
01:57:19,990 --> 01:57:20,000
which is 10. so now that's logarithmic
 

7371
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,830
which is 10. so now that's logarithmic
time to add up the number of hours

7372
01:57:21,830 --> 01:57:21,840
time to add up the number of hours
 

7373
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:24,709
time to add up the number of hours
that people slept today sounds fantastic

7374
01:57:24,709 --> 01:57:24,719
that people slept today sounds fantastic
 

7375
01:57:24,719 --> 01:57:25,109
that people slept today sounds fantastic
yeah

7376
01:57:25,109 --> 01:57:25,119
yeah
 

7377
01:57:25,119 --> 01:57:26,550
yeah
there's only one problem how do you

7378
01:57:26,550 --> 01:57:26,560
there's only one problem how do you
 

7379
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:28,070
there's only one problem how do you
decide who's person number one and

7380
01:57:28,070 --> 01:57:28,080
decide who's person number one and
 

7381
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:29,669
decide who's person number one and
person number two

7382
01:57:29,669 --> 01:57:29,679
person number two
 

7383
01:57:29,679 --> 01:57:31,750
person number two
yes so if for example you just went out

7384
01:57:31,750 --> 01:57:31,760
yes so if for example you just went out
 

7385
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:33,270
yes so if for example you just went out
into the downtown and said hey get these

7386
01:57:33,270 --> 01:57:33,280
into the downtown and said hey get these
 

7387
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:33,990
into the downtown and said hey get these
thousand people

7388
01:57:33,990 --> 01:57:34,000
thousand people
 

7389
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:35,990
thousand people
go well if you're gonna go and say and

7390
01:57:35,990 --> 01:57:36,000
go well if you're gonna go and say and
 

7391
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,350
go well if you're gonna go and say and
by the way you're one and you're two and

7392
01:57:37,350 --> 01:57:37,360
by the way you're one and you're two and
 

7393
01:57:37,360 --> 01:57:38,709
by the way you're one and you're two and
you're three that's linear time

7394
01:57:38,709 --> 01:57:38,719
you're three that's linear time
 

7395
01:57:38,719 --> 01:57:41,109
you're three that's linear time
yes that's cheating so now the question

7396
01:57:41,109 --> 01:57:41,119
yes that's cheating so now the question
 

7397
01:57:41,119 --> 01:57:42,950
yes that's cheating so now the question
is how to do this in a distributed way

7398
01:57:42,950 --> 01:57:42,960
is how to do this in a distributed way
 

7399
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:44,709
is how to do this in a distributed way
and there were some people who proposed

7400
01:57:44,709 --> 01:57:44,719
and there were some people who proposed
 

7401
01:57:44,719 --> 01:57:47,189
and there were some people who proposed
a very elegant algorithm

7402
01:57:47,189 --> 01:57:47,199
a very elegant algorithm
 

7403
01:57:47,199 --> 01:57:48,950
a very elegant algorithm
and they wanted to analyze it that's so

7404
01:57:48,950 --> 01:57:48,960
and they wanted to analyze it that's so
 

7405
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:50,550
and they wanted to analyze it that's so
i came in onto the analyze side

7406
01:57:50,550 --> 01:57:50,560
i came in onto the analyze side
 

7407
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:52,709
i came in onto the analyze side
but the elegant algorithm was like this

7408
01:57:52,709 --> 01:57:52,719
but the elegant algorithm was like this
 

7409
01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:53,990
but the elegant algorithm was like this
it was like well

7410
01:57:53,990 --> 01:57:54,000
it was like well
 

7411
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,870
it was like well
we don't actually know what this big nut

7412
01:57:56,870 --> 01:57:56,880
we don't actually know what this big nut
 

7413
01:57:56,880 --> 01:57:58,709
we don't actually know what this big nut
big tree is there isn't any big tree

7414
01:57:58,709 --> 01:57:58,719
big tree is there isn't any big tree
 

7415
01:57:58,719 --> 01:58:00,950
big tree is there isn't any big tree
so what's going to happen is first

7416
01:58:00,950 --> 01:58:00,960
so what's going to happen is first
 

7417
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:02,310
so what's going to happen is first
everyone is going to

7418
01:58:02,310 --> 01:58:02,320
everyone is going to
 

7419
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:05,189
everyone is going to
decide right now oh what one important

7420
01:58:05,189 --> 01:58:05,199
decide right now oh what one important
 

7421
01:58:05,199 --> 01:58:05,589
decide right now oh what one important
thing

7422
01:58:05,589 --> 01:58:05,599
thing
 

7423
01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:07,350
thing
everyone is going to at the very

7424
01:58:07,350 --> 01:58:07,360
everyone is going to at the very
 

7425
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:08,709
everyone is going to at the very
beginning of the whole

7426
01:58:08,709 --> 01:58:08,719
beginning of the whole
 

7427
01:58:08,719 --> 01:58:11,350
beginning of the whole
game uh they will have delegated

7428
01:58:11,350 --> 01:58:11,360
game uh they will have delegated
 

7429
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:13,270
game uh they will have delegated
responsibility to themselves

7430
01:58:13,270 --> 01:58:13,280
responsibility to themselves
 

7431
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:16,310
responsibility to themselves
as the one who knows the sum so far

7432
01:58:16,310 --> 01:58:16,320
as the one who knows the sum so far
 

7433
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:18,229
as the one who knows the sum so far
so so the point is there's there's going

7434
01:58:18,229 --> 01:58:18,239
so so the point is there's there's going
 

7435
01:58:18,239 --> 01:58:20,070
so so the point is there's there's going
to be people are all going to have like

7436
01:58:20,070 --> 01:58:20,080
to be people are all going to have like
 

7437
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:21,669
to be people are all going to have like
a pointer which says

7438
01:58:21,669 --> 01:58:21,679
a pointer which says
 

7439
01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:24,470
a pointer which says
uh you are the one who knows my you

7440
01:58:24,470 --> 01:58:24,480
uh you are the one who knows my you
 

7441
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:26,550
uh you are the one who knows my you
you've taken care of my ticket my number

7442
01:58:26,550 --> 01:58:26,560
you've taken care of my ticket my number
 

7443
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:29,350
you've taken care of my ticket my number
yeah okay they select the representative

7444
01:58:29,350 --> 01:58:29,360
yeah okay they select the representative
 

7445
01:58:29,360 --> 01:58:29,830
yeah okay they select the representative
for this

7446
01:58:29,830 --> 01:58:29,840

we're adding numbers okay
 

7501
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:20,790
we're adding numbers okay
but you can only add one number yeah so

when they do the coin flipping this
 

7539
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:54,470

it's that anyone who has the pointers
 

7545
01:59:58,320 --> 01:59:59,750
it's that anyone who has the pointers
themselves that's a

02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:37,270
else you just pick a random person
when you pick the random person if it

i i actually delegated it to someone
 

7593
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:42,550
i i actually delegated it to someone
then you

7594
02:00:42,550 --> 02:00:42,560
then you
 

7595
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:44,470
then you
you you follow up you walk through the

7596
02:00:44,470 --> 02:00:44,480
you you follow up you walk through the
 

7597
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:46,229
you you follow up you walk through the
delegation chat up delegation chain and

7598
02:00:46,229 --> 02:00:46,239
delegation chat up delegation chain and
 

7599
02:00:46,239 --> 02:00:46,950
delegation chat up delegation chain and
you can do

7600
02:00:46,950 --> 02:00:46,960
you can do
 

7601
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:49,030
you can do
like path compression in the algorithm

7602
02:00:49,030 --> 02:00:49,040
like path compression in the algorithm
 

7603
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:50,709
like path compression in the algorithm
to make it so you don't consistently do

7604
02:00:50,709 --> 02:00:50,719
to make it so you don't consistently do
 

7605
02:00:50,719 --> 02:00:51,910
to make it so you don't consistently do
lots of walking up

7606
02:00:51,910 --> 02:00:51,920
lots of walking up
 

7607
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:53,910
lots of walking up
but the bottom line is that what ends up

7608
02:00:53,910 --> 02:00:53,920
but the bottom line is that what ends up
 

7609
02:00:53,920 --> 02:00:55,270
but the bottom line is that what ends up
happening is that

7610
02:00:55,270 --> 02:00:55,280
happening is that
 

7611
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:57,669
happening is that
you end up reaching out whenever you're

7612
02:00:57,669 --> 02:00:57,679
you end up reaching out whenever you're
 

7613
02:00:57,679 --> 02:00:59,030
you end up reaching out whenever you're
one of the ones reaching out

7614
02:00:59,030 --> 02:00:59,040
one of the ones reaching out
 

7615
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:01,189
one of the ones reaching out
you can think of it as each agent is

7616
02:01:01,189 --> 02:01:01,199
you can think of it as each agent is
 

7617
02:01:01,199 --> 02:01:03,270
you can think of it as each agent is
responsible for some number of people

7618
02:01:03,270 --> 02:01:03,280
responsible for some number of people
 

7619
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:04,870
responsible for some number of people
it's almost like they're the leader of a

7620
02:01:04,870 --> 02:01:04,880
it's almost like they're the leader of a
 

7621
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:07,109
it's almost like they're the leader of a
bunch as the process is evolving

7622
02:01:07,109 --> 02:01:07,119
bunch as the process is evolving
 

7623
02:01:07,119 --> 02:01:10,790
bunch as the process is evolving
you have these lumps each lump has an

7624
02:01:10,790 --> 02:01:10,800
you have these lumps each lump has an
 

7625
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:13,270
you have these lumps each lump has an
agent and when the agent reaches out

7626
02:01:13,270 --> 02:01:13,280
agent and when the agent reaches out
 

7627
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:14,629
agent and when the agent reaches out
they reach out to another

7628
02:01:14,629 --> 02:01:14,639
they reach out to another
 

7629
02:01:14,639 --> 02:01:17,030
they reach out to another
lump where the probability of them

7630
02:01:17,030 --> 02:01:17,040
lump where the probability of them
 

7631
02:01:17,040 --> 02:01:18,149
lump where the probability of them
hitting that lump

7632
02:01:18,149 --> 02:01:18,159
hitting that lump
 

7633
02:01:18,159 --> 02:01:21,270
hitting that lump
is proportional to the size of the lump

7634
02:01:21,270 --> 02:01:21,280
is proportional to the size of the lump
 

7635
02:01:21,280 --> 02:01:24,070
is proportional to the size of the lump
yeah that is the one funny thing about

7636
02:01:24,070 --> 02:01:24,080
yeah that is the one funny thing about
 

7637
02:01:24,080 --> 02:01:24,470
yeah that is the one funny thing about
this

7638
02:01:24,470 --> 02:01:24,480
this
 

7639
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:27,189
this
process this is not that they can reach

7640
02:01:27,189 --> 02:01:27,199
process this is not that they can reach
 

7641
02:01:27,199 --> 02:01:29,189
process this is not that they can reach
out to a uniformly random lump

7642
02:01:29,189 --> 02:01:29,199
out to a uniformly random lump
 

7643
02:01:29,199 --> 02:01:30,870
out to a uniformly random lump
where every lump has the same chance of

7644
02:01:30,870 --> 02:01:30,880
where every lump has the same chance of
 

7645
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:32,390
where every lump has the same chance of
going to yeah

7646
02:01:32,390 --> 02:01:32,400
going to yeah
 

7647
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:35,430
going to yeah
the bigger the lump is the less like

7648
02:01:35,430 --> 02:01:35,440
the bigger the lump is the less like
 

7649
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:37,910
the bigger the lump is the less like
the more likely it is that you end up

7650
02:01:37,910 --> 02:01:37,920
the more likely it is that you end up
 

7651
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:40,070
the more likely it is that you end up
reaching that lamp which is a problem

7652
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:40,080
reaching that lamp which is a problem
 

7653
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:41,510
reaching that lamp which is a problem
let me explain why that's a problem

7654
02:01:41,510 --> 02:01:41,520
let me explain why that's a problem
 

7655
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:43,589
let me explain why that's a problem
because you see you're hoping that this

7656
02:01:43,589 --> 02:01:43,599
because you see you're hoping that this
 

7657
02:01:43,599 --> 02:01:45,430
because you see you're hoping that this
has a small number of steps yeah but

7658
02:01:45,430 --> 02:01:45,440
has a small number of steps yeah but
 

7659
02:01:45,440 --> 02:01:47,669
has a small number of steps yeah but
here's a bad situation that could happen

7660
02:01:47,669 --> 02:01:47,679
here's a bad situation that could happen
 

7661
02:01:47,679 --> 02:01:50,629
here's a bad situation that could happen
imagine if you had like their end people

7662
02:01:50,629 --> 02:01:50,639
imagine if you had like their end people
 

7663
02:01:50,639 --> 02:01:51,990
imagine if you had like their end people
that you're adding up

7664
02:01:51,990 --> 02:01:52,000
that you're adding up
 

7665
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,149
that you're adding up
imagine that you have exactly square

7666
02:01:54,149 --> 02:01:54,159
imagine that you have exactly square
 

7667
02:01:54,159 --> 02:01:55,669
imagine that you have exactly square
root of n

7668
02:01:55,669 --> 02:01:55,679
root of n
 

7669
02:01:55,679 --> 02:01:59,270
root of n
lumps left of which

7670
02:01:59,270 --> 02:01:59,280
lumps left of which
 

7671
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:01,350
lumps left of which
almost all of them are just one person

7672
02:02:01,350 --> 02:02:01,360
almost all of them are just one person
 

7673
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:02,390
almost all of them are just one person
who's still their own

7674
02:02:02,390 --> 02:02:02,400
who's still their own
 

7675
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:04,629
who's still their own
boss their own their own manager except

7676
02:02:04,629 --> 02:02:04,639
boss their own their own manager except
 

7677
02:02:04,639 --> 02:02:05,990
boss their own their own manager except
one giant one giant one

7678
02:02:05,990 --> 02:02:06,000
one giant one giant one
 

7679
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,189
one giant one giant one
now what's going to happen is going to

7680
02:02:07,189 --> 02:02:07,199
now what's going to happen is going to
 

7681
02:02:07,199 --> 02:02:09,109
now what's going to happen is going to
be a huge bottleneck because every round

7682
02:02:09,109 --> 02:02:09,119
be a huge bottleneck because every round
 

7683
02:02:09,119 --> 02:02:10,950
be a huge bottleneck because every round
the giant one can only absorb one of the

7684
02:02:10,950 --> 02:02:10,960
the giant one can only absorb one of the
 

7685
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:11,350
the giant one can only absorb one of the
others

7686
02:02:11,350 --> 02:02:11,360
others
 

7687
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:13,750
others
yes and now you suddenly have time which

7688
02:02:13,750 --> 02:02:13,760
yes and now you suddenly have time which
 

7689
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:15,669
yes and now you suddenly have time which
is about square root of n

7690
02:02:15,669 --> 02:02:15,679
is about square root of n
 

7691
02:02:15,679 --> 02:02:17,350
is about square root of n
the square root of n is chosen because

7692
02:02:17,350 --> 02:02:17,360
the square root of n is chosen because
 

7693
02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:19,270
the square root of n is chosen because
that is one where the

7694
02:02:19,270 --> 02:02:19,280
that is one where the
 

7695
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:21,750
that is one where the
the lumps are such that um you really

7696
02:02:21,750 --> 02:02:21,760
the lumps are such that um you really
 

7697
02:02:21,760 --> 02:02:23,510
the lumps are such that um you really
are limited by this large one

7698
02:02:23,510 --> 02:02:23,520
are limited by this large one
 

7699
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:26,070
are limited by this large one
slowly sucking up the rest of them so

7700
02:02:26,070 --> 02:02:26,080
slowly sucking up the rest of them so
 

7701
02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:28,070
slowly sucking up the rest of them so
the the heart of the question became

7702
02:02:28,070 --> 02:02:28,080
the the heart of the question became
 

7703
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:30,390
the the heart of the question became
well but is that just so unusual that we

7704
02:02:30,390 --> 02:02:30,400
well but is that just so unusual that we
 

7705
02:02:30,400 --> 02:02:32,629
well but is that just so unusual that we
don't that it doesn't usually happen

7706
02:02:32,629 --> 02:02:32,639
don't that it doesn't usually happen
 

7707
02:02:32,639 --> 02:02:34,550
don't that it doesn't usually happen
because remember you start with everyone

7708
02:02:34,550 --> 02:02:34,560
because remember you start with everyone
 

7709
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:36,550
because remember you start with everyone
just being independent it's like a lot

7710
02:02:36,550 --> 02:02:36,560
just being independent it's like a lot
 

7711
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:38,229
just being independent it's like a lot
of lumps of size well how naturally do

7712
02:02:38,229 --> 02:02:38,239
of lumps of size well how naturally do
 

7713
02:02:38,239 --> 02:02:39,589
of lumps of size well how naturally do
the big lumps emerge

7714
02:02:39,589 --> 02:02:39,599
the big lumps emerge
 

7715
02:02:39,599 --> 02:02:41,750
the big lumps emerge
yes and so what that part of the proof

7716
02:02:41,750 --> 02:02:41,760
yes and so what that part of the proof
 

7717
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:43,669
yes and so what that part of the proof
was was showing that that was a joint

7718
02:02:43,669 --> 02:02:43,679
was was showing that that was a joint
 

7719
02:02:43,679 --> 02:02:44,950
was was showing that that was a joint
work with al lubetsky

7720
02:02:44,950 --> 02:02:44,960
work with al lubetsky
 

7721
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:48,390
work with al lubetsky
that one was showing that actually

7722
02:02:48,390 --> 02:02:48,400
that one was showing that actually
 

7723
02:02:48,400 --> 02:02:49,910
that one was showing that actually
in that thing the lumps do kind of get

7724
02:02:49,910 --> 02:02:49,920
in that thing the lumps do kind of get
 

7725
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:51,910
in that thing the lumps do kind of get
out of whack and so it's not

7726
02:02:51,910 --> 02:02:51,920
out of whack and so it's not
 

7727
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:54,550
out of whack and so it's not
the purely logarithmic number of steps

7728
02:02:54,550 --> 02:02:54,560
the purely logarithmic number of steps
 

7729
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:56,629
the purely logarithmic number of steps
but if you make one very slight change

7730
02:02:56,629 --> 02:02:56,639
but if you make one very slight change
 

7731
02:02:56,639 --> 02:03:00,310
but if you make one very slight change
which is if you are one of the agents

7732
02:03:00,310 --> 02:03:00,320
which is if you are one of the agents
 

7733
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:02,310
which is if you are one of the agents
and you have just been propositioned

7734
02:03:02,310 --> 02:03:02,320
and you have just been propositioned
 

7735
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:03,589
and you have just been propositioned
possibly relayed along

7736
02:03:03,589 --> 02:03:03,599
possibly relayed along
 

7737
02:03:03,599 --> 02:03:05,589
possibly relayed along
by a couple of different people if you

7738
02:03:05,589 --> 02:03:05,599
by a couple of different people if you
 

7739
02:03:05,599 --> 02:03:07,589
by a couple of different people if you
just say don't take a random one

7740
02:03:07,589 --> 02:03:07,599
just say don't take a random one
 

7741
02:03:07,599 --> 02:03:12,550
just say don't take a random one
but accept the smallest lump

7742
02:03:12,550 --> 02:03:12,560

 

7743
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:14,070

that actually does enough to even

7744
02:03:14,070 --> 02:03:14,080
that actually does enough to even
 

7745
02:03:14,080 --> 02:03:15,589
that actually does enough to even
distribute the lump size

7746
02:03:15,589 --> 02:03:15,599
distribute the lump size
 

7747
02:03:15,599 --> 02:03:17,589
distribute the lump size
yeah that's i mean yeah it's fascinating

7748
02:03:17,589 --> 02:03:17,599
yeah that's i mean yeah it's fascinating
 

7749
02:03:17,599 --> 02:03:19,030
yeah that's i mean yeah it's fascinating
how would the distributed algorithms a

7750
02:03:19,030 --> 02:03:19,040
how would the distributed algorithms a
 

7751
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:19,589
how would the distributed algorithms a
little

7752
02:03:19,589 --> 02:03:19,599
little
 

7753
02:03:19,599 --> 02:03:22,390
little
yes make all the difference in the world

7754
02:03:22,390 --> 02:03:22,400
yes make all the difference in the world
 

7755
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:23,030
yes make all the difference in the world
yeah

7756
02:03:23,030 --> 02:03:23,040
yeah
 

7757
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:25,430
yeah
actually by the way this does this back

7758
02:03:25,430 --> 02:03:25,440
actually by the way this does this back
 

7759
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:27,430
actually by the way this does this back
to our voting conversation this makes me

7760
02:03:27,430 --> 02:03:27,440
to our voting conversation this makes me
 

7761
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:29,350
to our voting conversation this makes me
think of like

7762
02:03:29,350 --> 02:03:29,360
think of like
 

7763
02:03:29,360 --> 02:03:30,790
think of like
these networking systems are so

7764
02:03:30,790 --> 02:03:30,800
these networking systems are so
 

7765
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:32,390
these networking systems are so
fascinating to study

7766

02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:35,189
fascinating to study
they immediately spring to mind ideas of

7768
02:03:35,189 --> 02:03:35,199
they immediately spring to mind ideas of
 

7769
02:03:35,199 --> 02:03:35,990
they immediately spring to mind ideas of
how to have

7770
02:03:35,990 --> 02:03:36,000
how to have
 

7771
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:39,109
how to have
representation like i maybe

7772
02:03:39,109 --> 02:03:39,119
representation like i maybe
 

7773
02:03:39,119 --> 02:03:42,149
representation like i maybe
as opposed to me voting for a president

7774
02:03:42,149 --> 02:03:42,159
as opposed to me voting for a president
 

7775
02:03:42,159 --> 02:03:45,589
as opposed to me voting for a president
i want to vote for for like uh

7776
02:03:45,589 --> 02:03:45,599
i want to vote for for like uh
 

7777
02:03:45,599 --> 02:03:48,870
i want to vote for for like uh
for you paul to represent me maybe on a

7778
02:03:48,870 --> 02:03:48,880
for you paul to represent me maybe on a
 

7779
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:50,550
for you paul to represent me maybe on a
particular issue

7780
02:03:50,550 --> 02:03:50,560
particular issue
 

7781
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:52,470
particular issue
and then you'll delegate that further

7782
02:03:52,470 --> 02:03:52,480
and then you'll delegate that further
 

7783
02:03:52,480 --> 02:03:54,069
and then you'll delegate that further
and then we naturally construct those

7784
02:03:54,069 --> 02:03:54,079
and then we naturally construct those
 

7785
02:03:54,079 --> 02:03:55,030
and then we naturally construct those
kinds of networks

7786
02:03:55,030 --> 02:03:55,040
kinds of networks
 

7787
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:57,990
kinds of networks
because that that feels like i can have

7788
02:03:57,990 --> 02:03:58,000
because that that feels like i can have
 

7789
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:59,510
because that that feels like i can have
a good conversation with you and figure

7790
02:03:59,510 --> 02:03:59,520
a good conversation with you and figure
 

7791
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:00,790
a good conversation with you and figure
out that you know what you're doing and

7792
02:04:00,790 --> 02:04:00,800
out that you know what you're doing and
 

7793
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:02,069
out that you know what you're doing and
i can delegate it to you and

7794
02:04:02,069 --> 02:04:02,079
i can delegate it to you and
 

7795
02:04:02,079 --> 02:04:04,550
i can delegate it to you and
in that way construct a representative

7796
02:04:04,550 --> 02:04:04,560
in that way construct a representative
 

7797
02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:05,430
in that way construct a representative
government

7798
02:04:05,430 --> 02:04:05,440
government
 

7799
02:04:05,440 --> 02:04:08,709
government
or representative decision maker that

7800
02:04:08,709 --> 02:04:08,719
or representative decision maker that
 

7801
02:04:08,719 --> 02:04:09,270
or representative decision maker that
feels

7802
02:04:09,270 --> 02:04:09,280
feels
 

7803
02:04:09,280 --> 02:04:11,350
feels
that feels really nice as opposed to

7804
02:04:11,350 --> 02:04:11,360
that feels really nice as opposed to
 

7805
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:12,390
that feels really nice as opposed to
like us

7806
02:04:12,390 --> 02:04:12,400
like us
 

7807
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:14,550
like us
like a tree of height one or something

7808
02:04:14,550 --> 02:04:14,560
like a tree of height one or something
 

7809
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:16,870
like a tree of height one or something
where it's like everybody's just

7810
02:04:16,870 --> 02:04:16,880
where it's like everybody's just
 

7811
02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:19,510
where it's like everybody's just
um it feels like there's a lot of room

7812
02:04:19,510 --> 02:04:19,520
um it feels like there's a lot of room
 

7813
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:21,830
um it feels like there's a lot of room
for layers of representation to form

7814
02:04:21,830 --> 02:04:21,840
for layers of representation to form
 

7815
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:23,669
for layers of representation to form
organically from the bottom up

7816
02:04:23,669 --> 02:04:23,679
organically from the bottom up
 

7817
02:04:23,679 --> 02:04:25,270
organically from the bottom up
i wonder if there are systems like that

7818
02:04:25,270 --> 02:04:25,280
i wonder if there are systems like that
 

7819
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:26,470
i wonder if there are systems like that
this is the cool thing about the

7820
02:04:26,470 --> 02:04:26,480
this is the cool thing about the
 

7821
02:04:26,480 --> 02:04:27,030
this is the cool thing about the
internet

7822
02:04:27,030 --> 02:04:27,040
internet
 

7823
02:04:27,040 --> 02:04:28,470
internet
and the digital space where we're so

7824
02:04:28,470 --> 02:04:28,480
and the digital space where we're so
 

7825
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:30,550
and the digital space where we're so
well connected just like with

7826
02:04:30,550 --> 02:04:30,560
well connected just like with
 

7827
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:33,270
well connected just like with
the novid app to to distribute

02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:37,350
information about the
the the spread of the disease we can the

the the spread of the disease we can the
 

7833
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:37,990
the the spread of the disease we can the
same way

7834
02:04:37,990 --> 02:04:38,000
same way
 

7835
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,870
same way
in a distributed sense form anything

7836
02:04:40,870 --> 02:04:40,880
in a distributed sense form anything
 

7837
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:42,870
in a distributed sense form anything
like

7838
02:04:42,870 --> 02:04:42,880
like
 

7839
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:45,990
like
any kind of knowledge bases that are

7840
02:04:45,990 --> 02:04:46,000
any kind of knowledge bases that are
 

7841
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:49,189
any kind of knowledge bases that are
formed in a decentralized way and

7842
02:04:49,189 --> 02:04:49,199
formed in a decentralized way and
 

7843
02:04:49,199 --> 02:04:52,149
formed in a decentralized way and
uh in a hierarchical way as opposed to

7844
02:04:52,149 --> 02:04:52,159
uh in a hierarchical way as opposed to
 

7845
02:04:52,159 --> 02:04:53,589
uh in a hierarchical way as opposed to
sort of

7846
02:04:53,589 --> 02:04:53,599
sort of
 

7847
02:04:53,599 --> 02:04:55,990
sort of
old way where there's no mechanism for

7848
02:04:55,990 --> 02:04:56,000
old way where there's no mechanism for
 

7849
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:56,870
old way where there's no mechanism for
large scale

02:04:56,870 --> 02:04:56,880
large scale
 

7851
02:04:56,880 --> 02:05:00,790
large scale
fast uh like distributed transactional

7852
02:05:00,790 --> 02:05:00,800
fast uh like distributed transactional
 

7853
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:01,589
fast uh like distributed transactional
information

7854
02:05:01,589 --> 02:05:01,599
information
 

7855
02:05:01,599 --> 02:05:03,030
information
this is really interesting this is where

7856
02:05:03,030 --> 02:05:03,040
this is really interesting this is where
 

7857
02:05:03,040 --> 02:05:06,790
this is really interesting this is where
almost like network graph theory

7858
02:05:06,790 --> 02:05:06,800
almost like network graph theory
 

7859
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:09,830
almost like network graph theory
becomes practical yeah most of that

7860
02:05:09,830 --> 02:05:09,840
becomes practical yeah most of that
 

7861
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:11,350
becomes practical yeah most of that
exciting work was done in the 20th

7862
02:05:11,350 --> 02:05:11,360
exciting work was done in the 20th
 

7863
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:12,870
exciting work was done in the 20th
century but most of the application will

7864
02:05:12,870 --> 02:05:12,880
century but most of the application will
 

7865
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:14,790
century but most of the application will
be in the 21st which is cool to think

7866
02:05:14,790 --> 02:05:14,800
be in the 21st which is cool to think
 

7867
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:15,589
be in the 21st which is cool to think
about

7868
02:05:15,589 --> 02:05:15,599
about
 

7869
02:05:15,599 --> 02:05:17,189
about
uh let me ask the most ridiculous

7870
02:05:17,189 --> 02:05:17,199
uh let me ask the most ridiculous
 

7871
02:05:17,199 --> 02:05:21,189
uh let me ask the most ridiculous
question you think p equals np wow

7872
02:05:21,189 --> 02:05:21,199
question you think p equals np wow
 

7873
02:05:21,199 --> 02:05:26,470
question you think p equals np wow
i don't know i mean i would say

7874
02:05:26,470 --> 02:05:26,480

 

7875
02:05:26,480 --> 02:05:28,149

i i know there are enough people who

7876
02:05:28,149 --> 02:05:28,159
i i know there are enough people who
 

7877
02:05:28,159 --> 02:05:30,229
i i know there are enough people who
have very strong interest in trying to

7878
02:05:30,229 --> 02:05:30,239
have very strong interest in trying to
 

7879
02:05:30,239 --> 02:05:33,109
have very strong interest in trying to
show that it is i'm talking about

7880
02:05:33,109 --> 02:05:33,119
show that it is i'm talking about
 

7881
02:05:33,119 --> 02:05:37,270
show that it is i'm talking about
government agencies

7882
02:05:37,270 --> 02:05:37,280

which would say believe that p equals np

7888
02:05:43,189 --> 02:05:43,199
which would say believe that p equals np
 

7889
02:05:43,199 --> 02:05:45,669
which would say believe that p equals np
uh my question almost like this is back

7890
02:05:45,669 --> 02:05:45,679
uh my question almost like this is back
 

7891
02:05:45,679 --> 02:05:47,189
uh my question almost like this is back
to our aliens discussion you want to

7892
02:05:47,189 --> 02:05:47,199
to our aliens discussion you want to
 

7893
02:05:47,199 --> 02:05:48,390
to our aliens discussion you want to
think outside the box

7894
02:05:48,390 --> 02:05:48,400
think outside the box
 

7895
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:51,830
think outside the box
the the low probability event

7896
02:05:51,830 --> 02:05:51,840
the the low probability event
 

7897
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:54,470
the the low probability event
what is the world what kind of

7898
02:05:54,470 --> 02:05:54,480
what is the world what kind of
 

7899
02:05:54,480 --> 02:05:56,870
what is the world what kind of
discoveries would lead us to

7900
02:05:56,870 --> 02:05:56,880
discoveries would lead us to
 

7901
02:05:56,880 --> 02:06:01,589
discoveries would lead us to
to to prove that p does not equal to np

7902
02:06:01,589 --> 02:06:01,599
to to prove that p does not equal to np
 

7903
02:06:01,599 --> 02:06:03,310
to to prove that p does not equal to np
like there could be giant

7904
02:06:03,310 --> 02:06:03,320
like there could be giant
 

7905
02:06:03,320 --> 02:06:05,430
like there could be giant
misunderstandings

7907
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:07,589

problems
 

7917
02:06:14,719 --> 02:06:16,709
problems
yeah so i don't know the answer to this

7918
02:06:16,709 --> 02:06:16,719
yeah so i don't know the answer to this
 

7919
02:06:16,719 --> 02:06:18,069
yeah so i don't know the answer to this
question i think i think it's very

7920
02:06:18,069 --> 02:06:18,079
question i think i think it's very
 

7921
02:06:18,079 --> 02:06:18,870
question i think i think it's very
interesting but i

7922
02:06:18,870 --> 02:06:18,880
interesting but i
 

7923
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:21,350
interesting but i
actually i know let's put it this way by

7924
02:06:21,350 --> 02:06:21,360
actually i know let's put it this way by
 

7925
02:06:21,360 --> 02:06:22,790
actually i know let's put it this way by

could happen is like yeah
like half the time it'll probably happen

8090
02:09:06,950 --> 02:09:06,960
like half the time it'll probably happen
 

8091
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:08,390
like half the time it'll probably happen
so we're not very good at that that's

8092
02:09:08,390 --> 02:09:08,400
so we're not very good at that that's
 

8093
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:10,229
so we're not very good at that that's
that's the other thing with the pandemic

8094
02:09:10,229 --> 02:09:10,239
that's the other thing with the pandemic
 

8095
02:09:10,239 --> 02:09:13,589
that's the other thing with the pandemic
is uh we're not the exponential growth

8096
02:09:13,589 --> 02:09:13,599
is uh we're not the exponential growth
 

8097
02:09:13,599 --> 02:09:16,830
is uh we're not the exponential growth
that we also talked about offline uh is

8098
02:09:16,830 --> 02:09:16,840
that we also talked about offline uh is
 

8099
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:20,069
that we also talked about offline uh is
uh something that we can't quite intuit

8100
02:09:20,069 --> 02:09:20,079
uh something that we can't quite intuit
 

8101
02:09:20,079 --> 02:09:22,550
uh something that we can't quite intuit
and that's something we probably should

8102
02:09:22,550 --> 02:09:22,560
and that's something we probably should
 

8103
02:09:22,560 --> 02:09:24,149
and that's something we probably should
if we were to predict the future to

8104
02:09:24,149 --> 02:09:24,159
if we were to predict the future to
 

8105
02:09:24,159 --> 02:09:26,550
if we were to predict the future to
anticipate the future and to understand

8106
02:09:26,550 --> 02:09:26,560
anticipate the future and to understand
 

8107
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:28,550
anticipate the future and to understand
how to create technologies that'll let

8108
02:09:28,550 --> 02:09:28,560
how to create technologies that'll let
 

8109
02:09:28,560 --> 02:09:32,229
how to create technologies that'll let
us sort of control the future

8110
02:09:32,229 --> 02:09:32,239
us sort of control the future
 

8111
02:09:32,239 --> 02:09:34,629
us sort of control the future

i was interested somehow in like

8162
02:10:28,229 --> 02:10:28,239
i was interested somehow in like
 

8163
02:10:28,239 --> 02:10:30,229
i was interested somehow in like
world war ii history for whatever reason

world war ii history for whatever reason
 

8165
02:10:30,239 --> 02:10:31,669
world war ii history for whatever reason
that's a campaign which is much more

8166
02:10:31,669 --> 02:10:31,679
that's a campaign which is much more
 

8167
02:10:31,679 --> 02:10:32,390
that's a campaign which is much more
brutal

8168
02:10:32,390 --> 02:10:32,400
brutal
 

8169
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:35,589
brutal
but nevertheless the idea of

8170
02:10:35,589 --> 02:10:35,599
but nevertheless the idea of
 

8171
02:10:35,599 --> 02:10:39,030
but nevertheless the idea of
difficulty strategy uh fighting even

8172
02:10:39,030 --> 02:10:39,040
difficulty strategy uh fighting even
 

8173
02:10:39,040 --> 02:10:39,510
difficulty strategy uh fighting even
when

8174
02:10:39,510 --> 02:10:39,520
when
 

8175
02:10:39,520 --> 02:10:41,270
when
things that in that case was really

8176
02:10:41,270 --> 02:10:41,280
things that in that case was really
 

8177
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:43,109
things that in that case was really
fighting but just pushing on even when

8178
02:10:43,109 --> 02:10:43,119
fighting but just pushing on even when
 

8179
02:10:43,119 --> 02:10:44,550
fighting but just pushing on even when
things are difficult

8180
02:10:44,550 --> 02:10:44,560
things are difficult
 

8181
02:10:44,560 --> 02:10:46,470
things are difficult
i guess these are these are the kinds of

8182
02:10:46,470 --> 02:10:46,480
i guess these are these are the kinds of
 

8183
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:48,629
i guess these are these are the kinds of
general stories that

8184
02:10:48,629 --> 02:10:48,639
general stories that
 

8185
02:10:48,639 --> 02:10:51,430
general stories that
made me i guess want to work on things

8186
02:10:51,430 --> 02:10:51,440
made me i guess want to work on things
 

8187
02:10:51,440 --> 02:10:52,069
made me i guess want to work on things
that would be

8188
02:10:52,069 --> 02:10:52,079
that would be
 

8189
02:10:52,079 --> 02:10:55,510
that would be
hard and where it could be a campaign

8190
02:10:55,510 --> 02:10:55,520
hard and where it could be a campaign
 

8191
02:10:55,520 --> 02:10:57,030
hard and where it could be a campaign
it could be that you work on something

8192
02:10:57,030 --> 02:10:57,040
it could be that you work on something
 

8193
02:10:57,040 --> 02:11:00,709
it could be that you work on something
for a year multiple years

8194
02:11:00,709 --> 02:11:00,719
for a year multiple years
 

8195
02:11:00,719 --> 02:11:03,270
for a year multiple years
because that was the point yeah it

8196
02:11:03,270 --> 02:11:03,280
because that was the point yeah it
 

8197
02:11:03,280 --> 02:11:04,709
because that was the point yeah it
starts with a single person

8198
02:11:04,709 --> 02:11:04,719
starts with a single person
 

8199
02:11:04,719 --> 02:11:06,229
starts with a single person
that that's that's the interesting thing

8200
02:11:06,229 --> 02:11:06,239
that that's that's the interesting thing
 

8201
02:11:06,239 --> 02:11:07,830
that that's that's the interesting thing
i've obviously been

8202
02:11:07,830 --> 02:11:07,840
i've obviously been
 

8203
02:11:07,840 --> 02:11:09,669
i've obviously been
don't shut up about it recently about

8204
02:11:09,669 --> 02:11:09,679
don't shut up about it recently about
 

8205
02:11:09,679 --> 02:11:11,750
don't shut up about it recently about
world war ii especially on the hitler

8206
02:11:11,750 --> 02:11:11,760
world war ii especially on the hitler
 

8207
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:13,189
world war ii especially on the hitler
side and the stalin side

8208

side and the stalin side
 

8209
02:11:13,199 --> 02:11:15,189
side and the stalin side
some of that has really affected my own

8210
02:11:15,189 --> 02:11:15,199
some of that has really affected my own
 

8211
02:11:15,199 --> 02:11:17,830
some of that has really affected my own
family the the roots of my family very

family the the roots of my family very
 

8213

family the the roots of my family very
much

much
 

8215
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:22,550
much
but it's interesting to think um

8216
02:11:22,550 --> 02:11:22,560
but it's interesting to think um
 

8217
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:25,430
but it's interesting to think um
that it was just an idea and one person

8218
02:11:25,430 --> 02:11:25,440
that it was just an idea and one person
 

8219
02:11:25,440 --> 02:11:26,790
that it was just an idea and one person
decided to do stuff

8220
02:11:26,790 --> 02:11:26,800
decided to do stuff
 

8221
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:29,430
decided to do stuff
and it just builds and builds and builds

8222

which is
hard which might involve a campaign

didn't achieve that
 

8343
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:29,109
didn't achieve that
there's also the regret of what if i

8344
02:13:29,109 --> 02:13:29,119
there's also the regret of what if i
 

8345

see that's how i operate i don't operate

8348
02:13:32,149 --> 02:13:32,159
see that's how i operate i don't operate
 

8349

see that's how i operate i don't operate
based on did i succeed or fail it was

8350
02:13:33,750 --> 02:13:33,760
based on did i succeed or fail it was
 

8351
02:13:33,760 --> 02:13:34,550
based on did i succeed or fail it was
hard anyway

8352
02:13:34,550 --> 02:13:34,560
hard anyway
 

8353
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:35,990
hard anyway
if i did this novid thing and the whole

if i did this novid thing and the whole
 

8355
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,069
if i did this novid thing and the whole
thing failed would i feel terrible no

8356
02:13:38,069 --> 02:13:38,079
thing failed would i feel terrible no
 

8357
02:13:38,079 --> 02:13:39,990
thing failed would i feel terrible no
it's a very hard problem but would i

8358
02:13:39,990 --> 02:13:40,000
it's a very hard problem but would i
 

8359
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:41,350
it's a very hard problem but would i
have had the regret of

have had the regret of
 

8361
02:13:41,360 --> 02:13:44,390
have had the regret of
not jumping in yes so it's that

02:14:36,950 --> 02:14:36,960
like
 

8411
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:39,109
like
did it did it matter and so that's what

8412
02:14:39,109 --> 02:14:39,119
did it did it matter and so that's what
 

8413
02:14:39,119 --> 02:14:40,390
did it did it matter and so that's what
i that's what i

8414
02:14:40,390 --> 02:14:40,400
i that's what i
 

8415
02:14:40,400 --> 02:14:43,750
i that's what i
wanted um i guess that is very inspired

8416
02:14:43,750 --> 02:14:43,760
wanted um i guess that is very inspired
 

8417
02:14:43,760 --> 02:14:44,149
wanted um i guess that is very inspired

8418
02:14:44,149 --> 02:14:44,159
by
 

8419
02:14:44,159 --> 02:14:46,550
by
how scientists work it's like why do we

8420
02:14:46,550 --> 02:14:46,560
how scientists work it's like why do we
 

8421
02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:48,550
how scientists work it's like why do we
keep talking about newton it's because

8422
02:14:48,550 --> 02:14:48,560
keep talking about newton it's because
 

8423
02:14:48,560 --> 02:14:50,149
keep talking about newton it's because
newton discovered some interesting

8424
02:14:50,149 --> 02:14:50,159
newton discovered some interesting
 

8425
02:14:50,159 --> 02:14:52,149
newton discovered some interesting
things and so newton's score is pretty

8426
02:14:52,149 --> 02:14:52,159
things and so newton's score is pretty
 

8427
02:14:52,159 --> 02:14:53,510
things and so newton's score is pretty
high

8428
02:14:53,510 --> 02:14:53,520
high
 

8429
02:14:53,520 --> 02:14:56,470
high
it's going to be infinity right well

8430
02:14:56,470 --> 02:14:56,480
it's going to be infinity right well
 

8431
02:14:56,480 --> 02:14:58,550
it's going to be infinity right well
let's hope it's infinity but pretty high

8432
02:14:58,550 --> 02:14:58,560
let's hope it's infinity but pretty high
 

8433
02:14:58,560 --> 02:15:02,550
let's hope it's infinity but pretty high
ah yes yes so you're going for so person

8434
02:15:02,550 --> 02:15:02,560
ah yes yes so you're going for so person
 

8435
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:04,310
ah yes yes so you're going for so person
person years you're going for like

8436
02:15:04,310 --> 02:15:04,320
person years you're going for like
 

8437
02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:07,030
person years you're going for like
triple digits you're going for

8438
02:15:07,030 --> 02:15:07,040
triple digits you're going for
 

8439
02:15:07,040 --> 02:15:08,870
triple digits you're going for
it's like newton is like four digits

8440
02:15:08,870 --> 02:15:08,880
it's like newton is like four digits
 

8441
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:11,189
it's like newton is like four digits
probably like a thousand years

8442
02:15:11,189 --> 02:15:11,199
probably like a thousand years
 

8443
02:15:11,199 --> 02:15:13,430
probably like a thousand years
yeah yeah or personal lifetimes like how

8444
02:15:13,430 --> 02:15:13,440
yeah yeah or personal lifetimes like how
 

8445
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:15,270
yeah yeah or personal lifetimes like how
do you like to think well what are we

8446
02:15:15,270 --> 02:15:15,280
do you like to think well what are we
 

8447
02:15:15,280 --> 02:15:17,510
do you like to think well what are we
sorry i've met people times years people

8448
02:15:17,510 --> 02:15:17,520
sorry i've met people times years people
 

8449
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:19,030
sorry i've met people times years people
sometimes so so then it's like

8450
02:15:19,030 --> 02:15:19,040
sometimes so so then it's like
 

8451
02:15:19,040 --> 02:15:20,550
sometimes so so then it's like
actually this is huge this is like going

8452
02:15:20,550 --> 02:15:20,560
actually this is huge this is like going
 

8453
02:15:20,560 --> 02:15:22,149
actually this is huge this is like going
to be billions or trillions yeah

8454
02:15:22,149 --> 02:15:22,159
to be billions or trillions yeah
 

8455
02:15:22,159 --> 02:15:25,430
to be billions or trillions yeah
right the trillions but um i guess

8456
02:15:25,430 --> 02:15:25,440
right the trillions but um i guess
 

8457
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:27,589
right the trillions but um i guess
for me i actually changed the metric

8458
02:15:27,589 --> 02:15:27,599
for me i actually changed the metric
 

8459
02:15:27,599 --> 02:15:29,350
for me i actually changed the metric
after a while and the reason is because

8460
02:15:29,350 --> 02:15:29,360
after a while and the reason is because
 

8461
02:15:29,360 --> 02:15:31,430
after a while and the reason is because
you may have seen i found some simple

8462
02:15:31,430 --> 02:15:31,440
you may have seen i found some simple
 

8463
02:15:31,440 --> 02:15:33,510
you may have seen i found some simple
way to solve quadratic equations

8464
02:15:33,510 --> 02:15:33,520
way to solve quadratic equations
 

8465
02:15:33,520 --> 02:15:35,669
way to solve quadratic equations
that is easier than every textbook yes

8466
02:15:35,669 --> 02:15:35,679
that is easier than every textbook yes
 

8467
02:15:35,679 --> 02:15:36,550
that is easier than every textbook yes
so

8468
02:15:36,550 --> 02:15:36,560
so
 

8469
02:15:36,560 --> 02:15:39,109
so
my score might already be not bad which

8470
02:15:39,109 --> 02:15:39,119
my score might already be not bad which
 

8471
02:15:39,119 --> 02:15:40,709
my score might already be not bad which
is why i decided then let's change it

8472
02:15:40,709 --> 02:15:40,719
is why i decided then let's change it
 

8473
02:15:40,719 --> 02:15:41,510
is why i decided then let's change it
into

8474
02:15:41,510 --> 02:15:41,520
into
 

8475
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:44,069
into
the number of hours in the lifetimes as

8476
02:15:44,069 --> 02:15:44,079
the number of hours in the lifetimes as
 

8477
02:15:44,079 --> 02:15:45,830
the number of hours in the lifetimes as
well so the way i was doing it

8478
02:15:45,830 --> 02:15:45,840
well so the way i was doing it
 

8479
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:49,270
well so the way i was doing it
before is that

8480
02:15:49,270 --> 02:15:49,280
before is that
 

8481
02:15:49,280 --> 02:15:52,390
before is that
if a person was sort of remembering

8482
02:15:52,390 --> 02:15:52,400
if a person was sort of remembering
 

8483
02:15:52,400 --> 02:15:55,270
if a person was sort of remembering
or using or or or appreciating what i

8484
02:15:55,270 --> 02:15:55,280
or using or or or appreciating what i
 

8485
02:15:55,280 --> 02:15:56,069
or using or or or appreciating what i
had done

8486
02:15:56,069 --> 02:15:56,079
had done
 

8487
02:15:56,079 --> 02:15:59,270
had done
for for like 10 years if

8488
02:15:59,270 --> 02:15:59,280
for for like 10 years if
 

8489
02:15:59,280 --> 02:16:01,589
for for like 10 years if
of their life oh that would count as 10

8490
02:16:01,589 --> 02:16:01,599
of their life oh that would count as 10
 

8491
02:16:01,599 --> 02:16:03,589
of their life oh that would count as 10
i see so if there was one person who for

8492
02:16:03,589 --> 02:16:03,599
i see so if there was one person who for
 

8493
02:16:03,599 --> 02:16:04,229
i see so if there was one person who for
10 years

8494
02:16:04,229 --> 02:16:04,239
10 years
 

8495
02:16:04,239 --> 02:16:05,830
10 years
yes remembered or appreciated something

8496
02:16:05,830 --> 02:16:05,840
yes remembered or appreciated something
 

8497
02:16:05,840 --> 02:16:07,430
yes remembered or appreciated something
i did that counts as a score of 10 and

8498
02:16:07,430 --> 02:16:07,440
i did that counts as a score of 10 and
 

8499
02:16:07,440 --> 02:16:08,709
i did that counts as a score of 10 and
we add up over all people

8500
02:16:08,709 --> 02:16:08,719
we add up over all people
 

8501
02:16:08,719 --> 02:16:12,629
we add up over all people
yes and then uh and that was with the

8502
02:16:12,629 --> 02:16:12,639
yes and then uh and that was with the
 

8503
02:16:12,639 --> 02:16:14,310
yes and then uh and that was with the
hypothesis that the score

8504
02:16:14,310 --> 02:16:14,320
hypothesis that the score
 

8505
02:16:14,320 --> 02:16:17,510
hypothesis that the score
would be very finite in the sense that

8506
02:16:17,510 --> 02:16:17,520
would be very finite in the sense that
 

8507
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:19,189
would be very finite in the sense that
if i didn't come up with anything that

8508
02:16:19,189 --> 02:16:19,199
if i didn't come up with anything that
 

8509
02:16:19,199 --> 02:16:20,390
if i didn't come up with anything that
might potentially help a lot of

8510
02:16:20,390 --> 02:16:20,400
might potentially help a lot of
 

8511
02:16:20,400 --> 02:16:21,270
might potentially help a lot of
generations

8512
02:16:21,270 --> 02:16:21,280
generations
 

8513
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:23,350
generations
in a forever way then your score will be

8514
02:16:23,350 --> 02:16:23,360
in a forever way then your score will be
 

8515
02:16:23,360 --> 02:16:24,870
in a forever way then your score will be
finite because at some point

8516
02:16:24,870 --> 02:16:24,880
finite because at some point
 

8517
02:16:24,880 --> 02:16:27,510
finite because at some point
it's not people don't remember that you

8518
02:16:27,510 --> 02:16:27,520
it's not people don't remember that you
 

8519
02:16:27,520 --> 02:16:29,430
it's not people don't remember that you
made like nice bottles or something yeah

8520
02:16:29,430 --> 02:16:29,440
made like nice bottles or something yeah
 

8521
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:32,150
made like nice bottles or something yeah
right but then after the quadratic

8522
02:16:32,150 --> 02:16:32,160
right but then after the quadratic
 

8523
02:16:32,160 --> 02:16:32,950
right but then after the quadratic
equation thing

8524
02:16:32,950 --> 02:16:32,960
equation thing
 

8525
02:16:32,960 --> 02:16:34,950
equation thing
it was that there's some chance that

8526
02:16:34,950 --> 02:16:34,960
it was that there's some chance that
 

8527
02:16:34,960 --> 02:16:36,070
it was that there's some chance that
that actually might make it into

8528
02:16:36,070 --> 02:16:36,080
that actually might make it into
 

8529
02:16:36,080 --> 02:16:36,950
that actually might make it into
textbooks

8530
02:16:36,950 --> 02:16:36,960
textbooks
 

8531
02:16:36,960 --> 02:16:39,110
textbooks
yes and if it makes it in textbooks the

8532
02:16:39,110 --> 02:16:39,120
yes and if it makes it in textbooks the
 

8533
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:40,389
yes and if it makes it in textbooks the
chance that there will be an easier way

8534
02:16:40,389 --> 02:16:40,399
chance that there will be an easier way
 

8535
02:16:40,399 --> 02:16:42,309
chance that there will be an easier way
discovered is actually quite small

8536
02:16:42,309 --> 02:16:42,319
discovered is actually quite small
 

8537
02:16:42,319 --> 02:16:45,190
discovered is actually quite small
yes so in that case then the score might

8538
02:16:45,190 --> 02:16:45,200
yes so in that case then the score might
 

8539
02:16:45,200 --> 02:16:46,230
yes so in that case then the score might
get bigger

8540
02:16:46,230 --> 02:16:46,240
get bigger
 

8541
02:16:46,240 --> 02:16:47,270
get bigger
i was just saying the score might

8542
02:16:47,270 --> 02:16:47,280
i was just saying the score might
 

8543
02:16:47,280 --> 02:16:49,589
i was just saying the score might
actually already have been achieved in

8544
02:16:49,589 --> 02:16:49,599
actually already have been achieved in
 

8545
02:16:49,599 --> 02:16:52,870
actually already have been achieved in
non-trivial way so see because it's fun

8546
02:16:52,870 --> 02:16:52,880
non-trivial way so see because it's fun
 

8547
02:16:52,880 --> 02:16:53,589
non-trivial way so see because it's fun
to think about

8548
02:16:53,589 --> 02:16:53,599
to think about
 

8549
02:16:53,599 --> 02:16:54,790
to think about
because it could be different you can

8550
02:16:54,790 --> 02:16:54,800
because it could be different you can
 

8551
02:16:54,800 --> 02:16:56,870
because it could be different you can
achieve a high score

8552
02:16:56,870 --> 02:16:56,880
achieve a high score
 

8553
02:16:56,880 --> 02:16:59,990
achieve a high score
by a small number of people using it for

8554
02:16:59,990 --> 02:17:00,000
by a small number of people using it for
 

8555
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:01,429
by a small number of people using it for
most of their lifetime and then

8556
02:17:01,429 --> 02:17:01,439
most of their lifetime and then
 

8557
02:17:01,439 --> 02:17:03,270
most of their lifetime and then
generations and generations

8558
02:17:03,270 --> 02:17:03,280
generations and generations
 

8559
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:06,070
generations and generations
or you can have if we do dissipate if we

8560
02:17:06,070 --> 02:17:06,080
or you can have if we do dissipate if we
 

8561
02:17:06,080 --> 02:17:07,910
or you can have if we do dissipate if we
do spread colonize

8562
02:17:07,910 --> 02:17:07,920
do spread colonize
 

8563
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:10,309
do spread colonize
become multi-planetary species you could

8564
02:17:10,309 --> 02:17:10,319
become multi-planetary species you could
 

8565
02:17:10,319 --> 02:17:11,270
become multi-planetary species you could
have that little

8566
02:17:11,270 --> 02:17:11,280
have that little
 

8567
02:17:11,280 --> 02:17:13,830
have that little
um a clever way to solve differential

8568
02:17:13,830 --> 02:17:13,840
um a clever way to solve differential
 

8569
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:14,469
um a clever way to solve differential

02:17:27,270 --> 02:17:27,280
a few hours in their lifetime but yes
 

8583
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:28,629
a few hours in their lifetime but yes
their kids would use it the kids the

8584
02:17:28,629 --> 02:17:28,639
their kids would use it the kids the
 

8585
02:17:28,639 --> 02:17:30,150
their kids would use it the kids the
kids would use it it'll spread and

8586
02:17:30,150 --> 02:17:30,160
kids would use it it'll spread and
 

8587
02:17:30,160 --> 02:17:31,190
kids would use it it'll spread and
you'll have that

8588
02:17:31,190 --> 02:17:31,200
you'll have that
 

8589
02:17:31,200 --> 02:17:33,669
you'll have that
impact in that kind of way yes so that's

8590
02:17:33,669 --> 02:17:33,679
impact in that kind of way yes so that's
 

8591
02:17:33,679 --> 02:17:35,429
impact in that kind of way yes so that's
why i renormalized it because i was like

8592
02:17:35,429 --> 02:17:35,439
why i renormalized it because i was like
 

8593
02:17:35,439 --> 02:17:36,790
why i renormalized it because i was like
well that's kind of dumb because what's

8594
02:17:36,790 --> 02:17:36,800
well that's kind of dumb because what's
 

8595
02:17:36,800 --> 02:17:38,070
well that's kind of dumb because what's
the importance of that that will save

8596
02:17:38,070 --> 02:17:38,080
the importance of that that will save
 

8597
02:17:38,080 --> 02:17:39,349
the importance of that that will save
people 15 minutes

8598
02:17:39,349 --> 02:17:39,359
people 15 minutes
 

8599
02:17:39,359 --> 02:17:41,429
people 15 minutes
um but so so what i meant is i didn't

8600
02:17:41,429 --> 02:17:41,439
um but so so what i meant is i didn't
 

8601
02:17:41,439 --> 02:17:46,230
um but so so what i meant is i didn't
want to count that as the main score

8602
02:17:46,230 --> 02:17:46,240

 

8603
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:47,750

well i'm gonna have to try to come up

8604
02:17:47,750 --> 02:17:47,760
well i'm gonna have to try to come up
 

8605
02:17:47,760 --> 02:17:49,110
well i'm gonna have to try to come up
with uh some kind of device that

8606
02:17:49,110 --> 02:17:49,120
with uh some kind of device that
 

8607
02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:50,950
with uh some kind of device that
everyone would want to use maybe to make

8608
02:17:50,950 --> 02:17:50,960
everyone would want to use maybe to make
 

8609
02:17:50,960 --> 02:17:51,669
everyone would want to use maybe to make
coffee because

8610
02:17:51,669 --> 02:17:51,679
coffee because
 

8611
02:17:51,679 --> 02:17:54,629
coffee because
coffee seems to be the prevalent uh

8612
02:17:54,629 --> 02:17:54,639
coffee seems to be the prevalent uh
 

8613
02:17:54,639 --> 02:17:55,910
coffee seems to be the prevalent uh
performance performance-enhancing

8614
02:17:55,910 --> 02:17:55,920
performance performance-enhancing
 

8615
02:17:55,920 --> 02:17:57,509
performance performance-enhancing
chemical that everyone uses so

8616
02:17:57,509 --> 02:17:57,519
chemical that everyone uses so
 

8617
02:17:57,519 --> 02:17:58,950
chemical that everyone uses so
i'll have to think about in those kinds

8618
02:17:58,950 --> 02:17:58,960
i'll have to think about in those kinds
 

8619
02:17:58,960 --> 02:18:00,629
i'll have to think about in those kinds
of metrics yeah but

8620
02:18:00,629 --> 02:18:00,639
of metrics yeah but
 

8621
02:18:00,639 --> 02:18:02,230
of metrics yeah but
but you see that that's just giving an

8622
02:18:02,230 --> 02:18:02,240
but you see that that's just giving an
 

8623
02:18:02,240 --> 02:18:04,549
but you see that that's just giving an
idea of i guess what i found meaningful

8624
02:18:04,549 --> 02:18:04,559
idea of i guess what i found meaningful
 

8625
02:18:04,559 --> 02:18:06,070
idea of i guess what i found meaningful
in general like whether or not it's like

8626
02:18:06,070 --> 02:18:06,080
in general like whether or not it's like
 

8627
02:18:06,080 --> 02:18:07,429
in general like whether or not it's like
whether or not that quadratic thing is

8628
02:18:07,429 --> 02:18:07,439
whether or not that quadratic thing is
 

8629
02:18:07,439 --> 02:18:08,230
whether or not that quadratic thing is
important or not

8630
02:18:08,230 --> 02:18:08,240
important or not
 

8631
02:18:08,240 --> 02:18:10,309
important or not
the general idea was i wanted to do

8632
02:18:10,309 --> 02:18:10,319
the general idea was i wanted to do
 

8633
02:18:10,319 --> 02:18:11,750
the general idea was i wanted to do
things that would outlast me

8634
02:18:11,750 --> 02:18:11,760
things that would outlast me
 

8635
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:13,349
things that would outlast me
yes and that was what inspired me and

8636
02:18:13,349 --> 02:18:13,359
yes and that was what inspired me and
 

8637
02:18:13,359 --> 02:18:14,629
yes and that was what inspired me and
that's just how i choose what problems

8638
02:18:14,629 --> 02:18:14,639
that's just how i choose what problems
 

8639
02:18:14,639 --> 02:18:15,589
that's just how i choose what problems
to work on

8640
02:18:15,589 --> 02:18:15,599
to work on
 

8641
02:18:15,599 --> 02:18:17,349
to work on
and that's the kind of immortalities

8642
02:18:17,349 --> 02:18:17,359
and that's the kind of immortalities
 

8643
02:18:17,359 --> 02:18:19,190
and that's the kind of immortalities
ideas that you've

8644
02:18:19,190 --> 02:18:19,200
ideas that you've
 

8645
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:22,950
ideas that you've
invented living on long after you

8646
02:18:22,950 --> 02:18:22,960
invented living on long after you
 

8647
02:18:22,960 --> 02:18:25,589
invented living on long after you
in the minds of others and humans are

that carry ideas for brief for just a

8654
02:18:32,870 --> 02:18:32,880
that carry ideas for brief for just a
 

8655
02:18:32,880 --> 02:18:33,589
that carry ideas for brief for just a
few years

8656
02:18:33,589 --> 02:18:33,599
few years

may not be the important thing it might

8658
02:18:35,030 --> 02:18:35,040
may not be the important thing it might
 

8659
02:18:35,040 --> 02:18:37,429
may not be the important thing it might
be the ideas that we carry with us

8660
02:18:37,429 --> 02:18:37,439
be the ideas that we carry with us
 

8661
02:18:37,439 --> 02:18:39,669
be the ideas that we carry with us
and invent new ones like we get a bunch

8662
02:18:39,669 --> 02:18:39,679
and invent new ones like we get a bunch
 

8663
02:18:39,679 --> 02:18:41,509
and invent new ones like we get a bunch
of baby ideas in our head

8664
02:18:41,509 --> 02:18:41,519
of baby ideas in our head
 

8665
02:18:41,519 --> 02:18:43,270
of baby ideas in our head
we borrow them from others and then

8666
02:18:43,270 --> 02:18:43,280
we borrow them from others and then
 

8667
02:18:43,280 --> 02:18:44,950
we borrow them from others and then
maybe we invent a new one

8668
02:18:44,950 --> 02:18:44,960
maybe we invent a new one
 

8669
02:18:44,960 --> 02:18:46,790
maybe we invent a new one
and that new one might have a life of

8670
02:18:46,790 --> 02:18:46,800
and that new one might have a life of
 

8671
02:18:46,800 --> 02:18:48,790
and that new one might have a life of
its own and

8672
02:18:48,790 --> 02:18:48,800
its own and
 

8673
02:18:48,800 --> 02:18:50,469
its own and
it's fun it's fun to think about that

8674
02:18:50,469 --> 02:18:50,479
it's fun it's fun to think about that
 

8675
02:18:50,479 --> 02:18:51,990
it's fun it's fun to think about that
idea living from many

8676
02:18:51,990 --> 02:18:52,000
idea living from many
 

8677
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,150
idea living from many
centuries to come unless we destroy

8678
02:18:54,150 --> 02:18:54,160
centuries to come unless we destroy
 

8679
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:56,790
centuries to come unless we destroy
ourselves but maybe ai will borrow it

8680
02:18:56,790 --> 02:18:56,800
ourselves but maybe ai will borrow it
 

8681
02:18:56,800 --> 02:18:59,750
ourselves but maybe ai will borrow it
and we'll remember poe as like that one

8682
02:18:59,750 --> 02:18:59,760
and we'll remember poe as like that one
 

8683
02:18:59,760 --> 02:19:00,469
and we'll remember poe as like that one
human that

8684
02:19:00,469 --> 02:19:00,479
human that
 

8685
02:19:00,479 --> 02:19:03,750
human that
that that helped us out before we of

8686
02:19:03,750 --> 02:19:03,760
that that helped us out before we of
 

8687
02:19:03,760 --> 02:19:05,349
that that helped us out before we of
