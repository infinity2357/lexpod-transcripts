00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,469
it was very uh very interesting very
striking and actually shaped

338
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:50,479
striking and actually shaped
 

339
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,390
striking and actually shaped
the early ways in which i started

340
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,400
the early ways in which i started
 

341
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,749
the early ways in which i started
thinking about the mind

342
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:53,759
thinking about the mind
 

343
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,510
thinking about the mind
and development of intelligence as a

344
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520
and development of intelligence as a
 

345
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,830
and development of intelligence as a
teenager his actual ideas or the way he

346
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:57,840
teenager his actual ideas or the way he
 

347
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,189
teenager his actual ideas or the way he
thought about it or just the fact that

348
00:05:59,189 --> 00:05:59,199
thought about it or just the fact that
 

349
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,710
thought about it or just the fact that
you could think about the developing

350
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720
you could think about the developing
 

351
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,430
you could think about the developing
mind at all

352
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
mind at all
 

353
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,830
mind at all
i guess both jean-pierre is the author

354
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:03,840
i guess both jean-pierre is the author
 

355
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,670
i guess both jean-pierre is the author
that's reintroduced me to the

356
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680
that's reintroduced me to the
 

357
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,990
that's reintroduced me to the
notion that intelligence and the mind is

358
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,000
notion that intelligence and the mind is
 

359
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,670
notion that intelligence and the mind is
something that you construct

360
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:09,680
something that you construct
 

361
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,350
something that you construct
through throughout your life and that

362
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,360
through throughout your life and that
 

363
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,790
through throughout your life and that
you the children

364
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:12,800
you the children
 

365
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,070
you the children
uh construct it in stages and i thought

366
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,080
uh construct it in stages and i thought
 

367
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,590
uh construct it in stages and i thought
that was a very interesting idea which

368
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:17,600
that was a very interesting idea which
 

369
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,510
that was a very interesting idea which
is you know of course very relevant

370
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
is you know of course very relevant
 

371
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,029
is you know of course very relevant
uh to ai to building artificial minds

372
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:23,039
uh to ai to building artificial minds
 

373
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,270

another book that i read around the same

374
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,280
another book that i read around the same
 

375
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,749
another book that i read around the same
time that had a big impact on me

376
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:27,759
time that had a big impact on me
 

377
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,270
time that had a big impact on me
uh and and there was actually a little

378
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,280
uh and and there was actually a little
 

379
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,870
uh and and there was actually a little
bit of overlap with john pierre as well

380
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:32,880
bit of overlap with john pierre as well

00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:37,199
time is jeff hawkins on
 

385
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,309
time is jeff hawkins on
intelligence which is a classic and he

386
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
intelligence which is a classic and he
 

387
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,189
intelligence which is a classic and he
has this vision

388
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:41,199
has this vision
 

389
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,189
has this vision
of the mind as a multi-scale hierarchy

390
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:45,199
of the mind as a multi-scale hierarchy
 

391
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,150
of the mind as a multi-scale hierarchy
of temporal prediction modules and these

392
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,160
of temporal prediction modules and these
 

393
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,909
of temporal prediction modules and these
ideas really resonated with me

394
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:49,919
ideas really resonated with me
 

395
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,029
ideas really resonated with me
like the the notion of a modular

396
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:53,039
like the the notion of a modular
 

397
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,230
like the the notion of a modular
hierarchy

398
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,240
hierarchy
 

399
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,350
hierarchy
um of you know potentially um

400
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,360
um of you know potentially um
 

401
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,629
um of you know potentially um
of compression functions or prediction

402
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:00,639
of compression functions or prediction
 

403
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,510
of compression functions or prediction
functions

404
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:01,520
functions
 

405
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,629
functions
i thought it was really really

406
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
i thought it was really really
 

407
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,110
i thought it was really really
interesting and it reshaped

408
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,120
interesting and it reshaped
 

409
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,430
interesting and it reshaped
uh the way it started thinking about how

410
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:07,440
uh the way it started thinking about how
 

411
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,390
uh the way it started thinking about how
to build

412
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:08,400
to build
 

413
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,990
to build
minds the hierarchical nature

414
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000
minds the hierarchical nature
 

415
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,230
minds the hierarchical nature
the which aspect also he's a

416
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:14,240
the which aspect also he's a
 

417
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,990
the which aspect also he's a
neuroscientist so he was thinking yes

418
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
neuroscientist so he was thinking yes
 

419
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,189
neuroscientist so he was thinking yes
actual he's basically talking about how

420
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:19,199
actual he's basically talking about how
 

421
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,350
actual he's basically talking about how
our mind works yeah the notion that

422
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:21,360
our mind works yeah the notion that
 

423
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,110
our mind works yeah the notion that
cognition is prediction

424
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:23,120
cognition is prediction
 

425
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,950
cognition is prediction
was an idea that was kind of new to me

426
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960
was an idea that was kind of new to me
 

427
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,550
was an idea that was kind of new to me
at the time and that i really loved at

428
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:26,560
at the time and that i really loved at
 

429
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,749
at the time and that i really loved at
the time

430
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:27,759
the time
 

431
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,629
the time
and yeah and the notion that yeah there

432
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:30,639
and yeah and the notion that yeah there
 

433
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,790
and yeah and the notion that yeah there
are multiple scales of processing

434
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:32,800
are multiple scales of processing
 

435
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,230
are multiple scales of processing
uh in the brain the hierarchy

436
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,240
uh in the brain the hierarchy
 

437
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,710
uh in the brain the hierarchy
yes this is before deep learning these

438
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:38,720
yes this is before deep learning these
 

439
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,550
yes this is before deep learning these
ideas of hierarchies

440
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:40,560
ideas of hierarchies
 

441
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,189
ideas of hierarchies
in here i've been around for a long time

442
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:43,199
in here i've been around for a long time
 

443
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,869
in here i've been around for a long time
even before on intelligence i mean

444
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:44,879
even before on intelligence i mean
 

445
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,070
even before on intelligence i mean
they've been around since the

446
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,080
they've been around since the
 

447
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,070
they've been around since the
1980s um and yeah that was before deep

448
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,080
1980s um and yeah that was before deep
 

449
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,189
1980s um and yeah that was before deep
learning but of course

450
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:51,199
learning but of course
 

451
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,189
learning but of course
i think these ideas really found their

452
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199
i think these ideas really found their
 

453
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,830
i think these ideas really found their
practical implementation in deep

454
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:56,840
practical implementation in deep
 

455
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,189
practical implementation in deep
learning what about the memory side of

456
00:07:59,189 --> 00:07:59,199
learning what about the memory side of
 

457
00:07:59,199 --> 00:07:59,670
learning what about the memory side of
things

458
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,680
things
 

459
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,430
things
i think he's talking about knowledge

460
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
i think he's talking about knowledge
 

461
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,710
i think he's talking about knowledge
representation

462
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:02,720

463
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,710

do you think about memory a lot one way

464
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:04,720
do you think about memory a lot one way
 

465
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,309
do you think about memory a lot one way
you can think of neural networks

466
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:06,319
you can think of neural networks
 

467
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,589
you can think of neural networks
as a kind of memory you're memorizing

468
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:09,599
as a kind of memory you're memorizing
 

469
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,629
as a kind of memory you're memorizing
things

470
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:10,639
things
 

471
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,749
things
but it doesn't seem to be the kind of

472
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:13,759
but it doesn't seem to be the kind of
 

473
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,110
but it doesn't seem to be the kind of
memory that's in our

474
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,120
memory that's in our
 

475
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,909
memory that's in our
brains or it doesn't have the same rich

00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:17,919
brains or it doesn't have the same rich
 

477
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,990

our brains
 

481
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,350
our brains
yes the brain is more for sparse access

482
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,360
yes the brain is more for sparse access
 

483
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,990
yes the brain is more for sparse access
memory so that you can actually retrieve

memory so that you can actually retrieve
 

485
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,390

you can ask yourself questions again yes
 

495
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,469
you can ask yourself questions again yes
you can program your own memory and

you can program your own memory and
language is actually

00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:40,320
language is actually
 

499
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,909
language is actually
the tool you used to do that i think

500
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:41,919
the tool you used to do that i think
 

501
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,909
the tool you used to do that i think
language is a kind of

00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:43,919
language is a kind of
 

503
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,710
language is a kind of
operating system for the mind and use

504
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:46,720
operating system for the mind and use
 

505
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,750
operating system for the mind and use
language

506
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
language
 

507
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,030
language
well one of the uses of language is as

508
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,040
well one of the uses of language is as
 

509
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,350
well one of the uses of language is as
a query that you run over your own

510
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,360
a query that you run over your own
 

511
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,310
a query that you run over your own
memory use

512
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:54,320
memory use
 

513
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,110
memory use
words as keys to retrieve specific

514
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,120
words as keys to retrieve specific
 

515
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,190
words as keys to retrieve specific
experiences of basic concepts specific

516
00:08:59,190 --> 00:08:59,200
experiences of basic concepts specific
 

517
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,990
experiences of basic concepts specific
starts

518
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000
starts
 

519
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,509
starts
like language is the way you store

520
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:01,519
like language is the way you store
 

521
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,829
like language is the way you store
thoughts not just in writing in the in

522
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839
thoughts not just in writing in the in
 

523
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,269
thoughts not just in writing in the in
the physical world but also in your own

524
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:05,279
the physical world but also in your own
 

525
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,990
the physical world but also in your own
mind

526
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,000
mind
 

527
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,509
mind
and it's also how you reach with them

528
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:07,519
and it's also how you reach with them
 

529
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,910
and it's also how you reach with them
like imagine if you didn't have language

530
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:09,920
like imagine if you didn't have language
 

531
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,310
like imagine if you didn't have language
then you would have to you would not

532
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:12,320
then you would have to you would not
 

533
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,670
then you would have to you would not
have really have a

534
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:13,680
have really have a
 

535
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,870
have really have a
self internally triggered uh way of

536
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:16,880
self internally triggered uh way of
 

537
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,670
self internally triggered uh way of
retrieving

538
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:17,680
retrieving
 

539
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,910
retrieving
past thoughts you would have to rely on

540
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:19,920
past thoughts you would have to rely on
 

541
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,190
past thoughts you would have to rely on
external experiences

542
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,200
external experiences
 

543
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,910
external experiences
for instance you you see a specific site

544
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:23,920
for instance you you see a specific site
 

545
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,670
for instance you you see a specific site
you smell specific smell and it brings

546
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:25,680
you smell specific smell and it brings
 

547
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,630
you smell specific smell and it brings
up memories

548
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:26,640
up memories
 

549
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,790
up memories
but you would naturally have a way to

550
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
but you would naturally have a way to
 

551
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,870
but you would naturally have a way to
deliberately deliberately access these

552
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:30,880
deliberately deliberately access these
 

553
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,590
deliberately deliberately access these
memories

554
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:31,600
memories
 

555
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,269
memories
without language well the interesting

556
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:33,279
without language well the interesting
 

557
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,870
without language well the interesting
thing you mentioned is you can also

558
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:34,880
thing you mentioned is you can also
 

559
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,990
thing you mentioned is you can also
program

560
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,000
program
 

561
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,030
program
the memory you can change it probably

562
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,040
the memory you can change it probably
 

563
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,430
the memory you can change it probably
with language yeah using language yes

564
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:41,440
with language yeah using language yes
 

565
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,310
with language yeah using language yes
well

566
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
well
 

567
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,230
well
let me ask you a chomsky question which

568
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:44,240
let me ask you a chomsky question which
 

569
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,430
let me ask you a chomsky question which
is like

570
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:45,440
is like
 

571
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,949
is like
first of all do you think language is

572
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:46,959
first of all do you think language is
 

573
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,030
first of all do you think language is
like fundamental

574
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,040
like fundamental
 

575
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,389
like fundamental
like uh there's turtles

576
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:52,399
like uh there's turtles
 

577
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,470
like uh there's turtles
what's at the bottom of the turtles they

578
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:54,480
what's at the bottom of the turtles they
 

579
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,470
what's at the bottom of the turtles they
don't go it can't be turtles all the way

580
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:56,480
don't go it can't be turtles all the way
 

581
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,190
don't go it can't be turtles all the way
down

582
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200
down
 

583
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,269
down
is language at the bottom of cognition

584
00:09:59,269 --> 00:09:59,279
is language at the bottom of cognition
 

585
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,110
is language at the bottom of cognition
of everything is like

586
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,120
of everything is like
 

587
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,550
of everything is like
language the fundamental

588
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:04,560
language the fundamental
 

589
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,550
language the fundamental
aspect of like what it means to be

590
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:08,560
aspect of like what it means to be
 

591
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,910
aspect of like what it means to be
a thinking thing no i don't think so

592
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:11,920
a thinking thing no i don't think so
 

593
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,750
a thinking thing no i don't think so
i think language you disagree with noam

594
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:13,760
i think language you disagree with noam
 

595
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,509
i think language you disagree with noam
chomsky yes

596
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:15,519
chomsky yes
 

597
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,910
chomsky yes
language is a layer on top of cognition

598
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:17,920
language is a layer on top of cognition
 

599
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,550
language is a layer on top of cognition
so

600
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:18,560
so
 

601
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,550
so
it is fundamental to cognition in the

602
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:20,560
it is fundamental to cognition in the
 

603
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,670
it is fundamental to cognition in the
sense that

604
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:21,680
sense that
 

605
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,910
sense that
to to use a computing metaphor i see

606
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:23,920
to to use a computing metaphor i see
 

607
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,949
to to use a computing metaphor i see
language as

608
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:24,959
language as
 

609
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,069
language as
the operating system uh of the brain of

610
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:28,079
the operating system uh of the brain of
 

611
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,030
the operating system uh of the brain of
the human mind

612
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,040
the human mind
 

613
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,949
the human mind
yeah and the operating system you know

614
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:30,959
yeah and the operating system you know
 

615
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,110
yeah and the operating system you know
is a layer on top of the computer

616
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,120
is a layer on top of the computer
 

617
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,670
is a layer on top of the computer
the computer exists before the operating

618
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:35,680
the computer exists before the operating
 

619
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,350
the computer exists before the operating
system but the operating system is how

620
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:37,360
system but the operating system is how
 

621
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,350
system but the operating system is how
you make it truly useful

622
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,360
you make it truly useful
 

623
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,509
you make it truly useful
and the operating system is most likely

624
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:41,519
and the operating system is most likely
 

625
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,550
and the operating system is most likely
windows not

626
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:42,560
windows not
 

627
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,350
windows not
not linux because it's uh language is

628
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:45,360
not linux because it's uh language is
 

629
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:45,829
not linux because it's uh language is
messy

630
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:45,839
messy
 

631
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,389
messy
yeah it's messy and it's uh it's um

632
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:48,399
yeah it's messy and it's uh it's um
 

633
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,230
yeah it's messy and it's uh it's um
pretty difficult to uh

634
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,240
pretty difficult to uh
 

635
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,350
pretty difficult to uh
uh inspect it introspect it how do you

636
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:53,360
uh inspect it introspect it how do you
 

637
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,030
uh inspect it introspect it how do you
think about language

638
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,040
think about language
 

639
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,389
think about language
like we use actually sort of human

640
00:10:58,389 --> 00:10:58,399
like we use actually sort of human
 

641
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,470
like we use actually sort of human
interpretable language but is there

642
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,480
interpretable language but is there
 

643
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,670
interpretable language but is there
something like

644
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:01,680
something like
 

645
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,430
something like
a deeper that's closer to like

646
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:05,440
a deeper that's closer to like
 

647
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,710
a deeper that's closer to like
like logical type of statements um

648
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
like logical type of statements um
 

649
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,430
like logical type of statements um
like yeah what is the nature of

650
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,440
like yeah what is the nature of
 

651
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,389
like yeah what is the nature of
language do you think because there's

652
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:16,399
language do you think because there's
 

653
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,150
language do you think because there's
something deeper than like the syntactic

654
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,160
something deeper than like the syntactic
 

655
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,670
something deeper than like the syntactic
rules we construct is there something

656
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:19,680
rules we construct is there something
 

657
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,389
rules we construct is there something
that

658
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:20,399
that
 

659
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,550
that
doesn't require utterances or

660
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:24,560
doesn't require utterances or
 

661
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,310
doesn't require utterances or
writing or so on are you asking about

662
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:26,320
writing or so on are you asking about
 

663
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,870
writing or so on are you asking about
the possibility that there could exist

664
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:28,880
the possibility that there could exist
 

665
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,509
the possibility that there could exist
uh languages for thinking that are not

666
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:31,519
uh languages for thinking that are not
 

667
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,790
uh languages for thinking that are not
made of words

668
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,800
made of words
 

669
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,550
made of words
yeah yeah i think so i think so

670
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:36,560
yeah yeah i think so i think so
 

671
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,030
yeah yeah i think so i think so
uh the mind is layers right and language

672
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,040
uh the mind is layers right and language
 

673
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,069
uh the mind is layers right and language
is almost like the

674
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:40,079
is almost like the
 

675
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,670
is almost like the
the outermost the uppermost layer

676
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
the outermost the uppermost layer
 

677
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,030
the outermost the uppermost layer
um but before we think in words i think

678
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
um but before we think in words i think
 

679
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,829
um but before we think in words i think
we think

680
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:47,839
we think
 

681
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,949
we think
in in terms of emotion in space

682
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:50,959
in in terms of emotion in space
 

683
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,790
in in terms of emotion in space
and we think in terms of physical

684
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:52,800
and we think in terms of physical
 

685
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,990
and we think in terms of physical
actions

686
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000
actions
 

687
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,790
actions
and i think a baby babies in particular

688
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:56,800
and i think a baby babies in particular
 

689
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,790
and i think a baby babies in particular
probably express his thoughts in terms

690
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:58,800
probably express his thoughts in terms
 

691
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,269
probably express his thoughts in terms
of

692
00:11:59,269 --> 00:11:59,279
of
 

693
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,150
of
um the actions uh that they've seen of

694
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,160
um the actions uh that they've seen of
 

695
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,670
um the actions uh that they've seen of
that or that they can perform

696
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:03,680
that or that they can perform
 

697
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,150
that or that they can perform
and in terms of the in in terms of

698
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,160
and in terms of the in in terms of
 

699
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,990
and in terms of the in in terms of
motions of objects in their environment

700
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
motions of objects in their environment
 

701
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,990
motions of objects in their environment
before they start thinking in terms of

702
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,000
before they start thinking in terms of
 

703
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,150
before they start thinking in terms of
words it's amazing to

704
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,160
words it's amazing to
 

705
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,350
words it's amazing to
think about that as the building

706
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:15,360
think about that as the building
 

707
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,829
think about that as the building
blocks of language so like the kind of

708
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:17,839
blocks of language so like the kind of
 

709
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,030
blocks of language so like the kind of
actions and

710
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,040
actions and
 

711
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,310
actions and
ways the babies see the world as like

712
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:22,320
ways the babies see the world as like
 

713
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,389
ways the babies see the world as like
more fundamental than the

714
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:24,399
more fundamental than the
 

715
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,230
more fundamental than the
beautiful shakespearean language you

716
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,240
beautiful shakespearean language you
 

717
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,550
beautiful shakespearean language you
construct on top of it

718
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:28,560
construct on top of it
 

719
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,389
construct on top of it
and we we probably don't have any idea

720
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:30,399
and we we probably don't have any idea
 

721
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,670
and we we probably don't have any idea
what that looks like right

722
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:31,680
what that looks like right
 

723
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,069
what that looks like right
like what because it's important for

724
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:34,079
like what because it's important for
 

725
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,190
like what because it's important for
them trying to

726
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,200
them trying to
 

727
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,310
them trying to
engineer it into ai systems

728
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:38,320
engineer it into ai systems
 

729
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,069
engineer it into ai systems
i think visual analogies and motion

730
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:42,079
i think visual analogies and motion
 

731
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,949
i think visual analogies and motion
is a fundamental building block of the

732
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:44,959
is a fundamental building block of the
 

733
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:45,829
is a fundamental building block of the
mind and you

734
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:45,839
mind and you
 

735
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,910
mind and you
you actually see it reflected in

736
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:47,920
you actually see it reflected in
 

737
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,389
you actually see it reflected in
language like language is full of

738
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:50,399
language like language is full of
 

739
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,470
language like language is full of
special metaphors and when you think

740
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,480
special metaphors and when you think
 

741
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,910
special metaphors and when you think
about things

742
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:53,920
about things
 

743
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,150
about things
i consider myself very much as a visual

744
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,160
i consider myself very much as a visual
 

745
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,350
i consider myself very much as a visual
thinker

746
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:57,360
thinker
 

747
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,710
thinker
you you often express your thoughts

748
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
you you often express your thoughts
 

749
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,829
you you often express your thoughts
um by using things like uh visualizing

750
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:04,839
um by using things like uh visualizing
 

751
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:06,470
um by using things like uh visualizing
concepts um

752
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:06,480
concepts um
 

753
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,350
concepts um
in in 2d space or like you solve

754
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:09,360
in in 2d space or like you solve
 

755
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,790
in in 2d space or like you solve
problems by image

756
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:10,800
problems by image
 

757
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,629
problems by image
imagining yourself navigating a concept

758
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:14,639
imagining yourself navigating a concept
 

759
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,230
imagining yourself navigating a concept
space i don't know if you have this sort

760
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,240
space i don't know if you have this sort
 

761
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,910
space i don't know if you have this sort
of experience

762
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:17,920
of experience
 

763
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,910
of experience
you said visualizing concept space so

764
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:19,920
you said visualizing concept space so
 

765
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,710
you said visualizing concept space so
like so i certainly think about

766
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720

 

767
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,629

i certainly met i certainly visualize

768
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:26,639
i certainly met i certainly visualize
 

769
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,990
i certainly met i certainly visualize
mathematical concepts

770
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,000
mathematical concepts
 

771
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,550
mathematical concepts
but you mean like in concept space

772
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,560
but you mean like in concept space
 

773
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,269
but you mean like in concept space
visually you're embedding ideas into

774
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:35,279
visually you're embedding ideas into
 

775
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:35,590
visually you're embedding ideas into
some

776
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:35,600
some
 

777
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,030
some
into a three-dimensional space you can

778
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,040
into a three-dimensional space you can
 

779
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,829
into a three-dimensional space you can
explore with your mind essentially

780
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:39,839
explore with your mind essentially
 

781
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,110
explore with your mind essentially
yeah 2d you're a flatlander

782
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:43,120
yeah 2d you're a flatlander
 

783
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,710
yeah 2d you're a flatlander
you're um okay no

784
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:46,720
you're um okay no
 

785
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,110
you're um okay no
i i i do not i always have to uh before

786
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,120
i i i do not i always have to uh before
 

787
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,509
i i i do not i always have to uh before
i jump from concept to concept i have to

788
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:53,519
i jump from concept to concept i have to
 

789
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,629
i jump from concept to concept i have to
put it back down on pape

790
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:56,639
put it back down on pape
 

791
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,550
put it back down on pape
and it has to be on paper i can only

792
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:58,560
and it has to be on paper i can only
 

793
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,910
and it has to be on paper i can only
travel

794
00:13:59,910 --> 00:13:59,920
travel
 

795
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,269
travel
on 2d paper not inside my mind

796
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:03,279
on 2d paper not inside my mind
 

797
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,350
on 2d paper not inside my mind
you're able to move inside your mind but

798
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,360
you're able to move inside your mind but
 

799
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,550
you're able to move inside your mind but
even if you're writing

800
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:06,560
even if you're writing
 

801
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,389
even if you're writing
like a paper for instance don't you have

802
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:08,399
like a paper for instance don't you have
 

803
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,310
like a paper for instance don't you have
like a special representation of your

804
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:10,320
like a special representation of your
 

805
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,990
like a special representation of your
paper

806
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,000
paper
 

807
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,590
paper
like you you visualize where ideas lie

808
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:15,600
like you you visualize where ideas lie
 

809
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,829
like you you visualize where ideas lie
topologically in relationship to other

810
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:17,839
topologically in relationship to other
 

811
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:18,870
topologically in relationship to other
ideas

812
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:18,880
ideas
 

813
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,670
ideas
kind of like a subway map of the ideas

814
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:21,680
kind of like a subway map of the ideas
 

815
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,389
kind of like a subway map of the ideas
in your paper

816
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:22,399
in your paper
 

817
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,550
in your paper
yeah that's true i mean there there is

818
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:24,560
yeah that's true i mean there there is
 

819
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,670
yeah that's true i mean there there is
uh

820
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:25,680
uh
 

821
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,629
uh
in papers i don't know about you but

822
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:28,639
in papers i don't know about you but
 

823
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,949
in papers i don't know about you but
there feels like there's a destination

824
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:30,959
there feels like there's a destination
 

825
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,310
there feels like there's a destination
um there's a there's a key

826
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:34,320
um there's a there's a key
 

827
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,710
um there's a there's a key
idea that you want to arrive at and a

828
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:36,720
idea that you want to arrive at and a
 

829
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,670
idea that you want to arrive at and a
lot of it is in

830
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:37,680
lot of it is in
 

831
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,710
lot of it is in
in the fog and you're trying to kind of

832
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:40,720
in the fog and you're trying to kind of
 

833
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,269
in the fog and you're trying to kind of
it's almost like um

834
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,279
it's almost like um
 

835
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,230
it's almost like um
what's that called when um you do a path

836
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:48,240
what's that called when um you do a path
 

837
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,750
what's that called when um you do a path
planning search from both directions

838
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:49,760
planning search from both directions
 

839
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,389
planning search from both directions
from the start and from the end

840
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:52,399
from the start and from the end
 

841
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,990
from the start and from the end
but and then you find you do like

842
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,000
but and then you find you do like
 

843
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,670
but and then you find you do like
shortest path but like

844
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:55,680
shortest path but like
 

845
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,829
shortest path but like
uh you know in game playing you do this

846
00:14:57,829 --> 00:14:57,839
uh you know in game playing you do this
 

847
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,509
uh you know in game playing you do this
with like a star

848
00:14:59,509 --> 00:14:59,519
with like a star
 

849
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,389
with like a star
from both sides when you see where they

850
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:02,399
from both sides when you see where they
 

851
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,430
from both sides when you see where they
join

852
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:03,440
join
 

853
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,829
join
yeah so you kind of do at least for me i

854
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:05,839
yeah so you kind of do at least for me i
 

855
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:06,629
yeah so you kind of do at least for me i
think like

856
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:06,639
think like
 

857
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,150
think like
first of all just exploring from the

858
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,160
first of all just exploring from the
 

859
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,990
first of all just exploring from the
start from like uh

860
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,000
start from like uh
 

861
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,470
start from like uh
first principles what do i know uh what

862
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:12,480
first principles what do i know uh what
 

863
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,670
first principles what do i know uh what
can i

864
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:13,680
can i
 

865
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,310
can i
start proving from that right and then

866
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:16,320
start proving from that right and then
 

867
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,990
start proving from that right and then
from the destination

868
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,000
from the destination
 

869
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,670
from the destination
if i you start backtracking like

870
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:21,680
if i you start backtracking like
 

871
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,310
if i you start backtracking like
if if i want to show some kind of sets

872
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:24,320
if if i want to show some kind of sets
 

873
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,350
if if i want to show some kind of sets
of ideas

874
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:25,360
of ideas
 

875
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,870
of ideas
what would it take to show them and you

876
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:26,880
what would it take to show them and you
 

877
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,550
what would it take to show them and you
kind of backtrack but

878
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:28,560
kind of backtrack but
 

879
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,470
kind of backtrack but
yeah i don't think i'm doing all that in

880
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:30,480
yeah i don't think i'm doing all that in
 

881
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,150
yeah i don't think i'm doing all that in
my mind though like i'm putting it down

882
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,160
my mind though like i'm putting it down
 

883
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,110
my mind though like i'm putting it down
on paper

884
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,120
on paper
 

885
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,790
on paper
do you use mind maps to organize your

886
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:34,800
do you use mind maps to organize your
 

887
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,670
do you use mind maps to organize your
ideas yeah i like mind maps

888
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:37,680
ideas yeah i like mind maps
 

889
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,710
ideas yeah i like mind maps
let's get into this i've been so jealous

890
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:40,720
let's get into this i've been so jealous
 

891
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,069
let's get into this i've been so jealous

been jealous of
people that seem to like they get like

896

people that seem to like they get like
 

897
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,990
people that seem to like they get like
this fire of passion in their eyes

898
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,000
this fire of passion in their eyes
 

899
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,910
this fire of passion in their eyes
because everything starts making sense

900
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:49,920
because everything starts making sense
 

901
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,069
because everything starts making sense
it's like uh tom cruise in the movie was

902
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:52,079
it's like uh tom cruise in the movie was
 

903
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,670
it's like uh tom cruise in the movie was
like moving stuff around

904
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:53,680
like moving stuff around
 

905
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,030
like moving stuff around
some of the most brilliant people i know

906
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,040
some of the most brilliant people i know
 

907
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,790
some of the most brilliant people i know
use mind maps i haven't tried

908
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:56,800
use mind maps i haven't tried
 

909
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,670
use mind maps i haven't tried
really can you explain what the hell a

910
00:15:59,670 --> 00:15:59,680
really can you explain what the hell a
 

911
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,030
really can you explain what the hell a
mind map is

912
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,040
mind map is
 

913
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,590
mind map is
i guess mind map is a way to make

914
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:03,600
i guess mind map is a way to make
 

915
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,829
i guess mind map is a way to make
connected mess inside your mind

916
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:05,839
connected mess inside your mind
 

917
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,710
connected mess inside your mind
to just put it on paper so that you gain

918
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:08,720
to just put it on paper so that you gain
 

919
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,910
to just put it on paper so that you gain
more control over it

920
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:09,920
more control over it
 

921
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,949
more control over it
it's a way to organize things on paper

922
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:12,959
it's a way to organize things on paper
 

923
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,629
it's a way to organize things on paper
and as as kind of like a consequence for

924
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:16,639
and as as kind of like a consequence for
 

925
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,230
and as as kind of like a consequence for
organizing things on paper it start

926
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:18,240
organizing things on paper it start
 

927
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,829
organizing things on paper it start
being more organized inside inside your

928
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:19,839
being more organized inside inside your
 

929
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,430
being more organized inside inside your
own mind what what does that look like

930
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:21,440
own mind what what does that look like
 

931
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,230
own mind what what does that look like
you put like do you have an example like

932
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:24,240
you put like do you have an example like
 

933
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:24,790
you put like do you have an example like
what what

934
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:24,800
what what
 

935
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,069
what what
what do you what's the first thing you

936
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:26,079
what do you what's the first thing you
 

937
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,150
what do you what's the first thing you
write on paper what's the second thing

938
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,160
write on paper what's the second thing
 

939
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,790
write on paper what's the second thing
you write

940
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:28,800
you write
 

941
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,110
you write
i mean typically uh you you draw a mind

942
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:31,120
i mean typically uh you you draw a mind
 

943
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,910
i mean typically uh you you draw a mind
map to

944
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:31,920
map to
 

945
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,710
map to
organize the way you think about a topic

946
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:34,720
organize the way you think about a topic
 

947
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,310
organize the way you think about a topic
so you would start by

948
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:36,320
so you would start by
 

949
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,629
so you would start by
writing down like the the key concept

950
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:38,639
writing down like the the key concept
 

951
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,550
writing down like the the key concept
about that topic like you would write

952
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:40,560
about that topic like you would write
 

953
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,550
about that topic like you would write
intelligence or something and then you

954
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:42,560
intelligence or something and then you
 

955
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,749
intelligence or something and then you
would start adding

956
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:43,759
would start adding
 

957
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,990
would start adding
uh associative connections like what do

958
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,000
uh associative connections like what do
 

959
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,350
uh associative connections like what do
you think about when you think about

960
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:47,360
you think about when you think about
 

961
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,030
you think about when you think about
intelligence what do you think are the

962
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,040
intelligence what do you think are the
 

963
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,710
intelligence what do you think are the
key elements of intelligence so maybe

964
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:50,720
key elements of intelligence so maybe
 

965
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,150
key elements of intelligence so maybe
you would have language for instance

966
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,160
you would have language for instance
 

967
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,269
you would have language for instance
instead of motion

968
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:53,279
instead of motion
 

969
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,710
instead of motion
and so you would start drawing notes

970
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:54,720
and so you would start drawing notes
 

971
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,230
and so you would start drawing notes
with these things and then you would see

972
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:56,240
with these things and then you would see
 

973
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,430
with these things and then you would see
what do you think about when you think

974
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:57,440
what do you think about when you think
 

975
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,389
what do you think about when you think
about motion

976
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:58,399
about motion
 

977
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,829
about motion
and so on and you would go like that

978
00:16:59,829 --> 00:16:59,839
and so on and you would go like that
 

979
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,590
and so on and you would go like that
like a tree it's a

980
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:01,600
like a tree it's a
 

981
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,630
like a tree it's a
tree or a tree mostly there's a graph to

982
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:04,640
tree or a tree mostly there's a graph to
 

983
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,189
tree or a tree mostly there's a graph to
like

984
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:05,199
like
 

985
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,350
like
a tree oh it's it's more of a graph than

986
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:07,360
a tree oh it's it's more of a graph than
 

987
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,110
a tree oh it's it's more of a graph than
a tree and

988
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,120
a tree and
 

989
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,829
a tree and
um and it's not limited to just you know

990
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:11,839
um and it's not limited to just you know
 

991
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,710
um and it's not limited to just you know
writing down

992
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:12,720
writing down
 

993
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,909
writing down
words you can also uh draw things

994
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:15,919
words you can also uh draw things
 

995
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,990
words you can also uh draw things
and it's not it's not supposed to be

996
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,000
and it's not it's not supposed to be
 

997
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,510
and it's not it's not supposed to be
purely hierarchical right

998
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:19,520
purely hierarchical right
 

999
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,309
purely hierarchical right
like you can um the point is that you

1000
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:22,319
like you can um the point is that you
 

1001
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,150
like you can um the point is that you
can start once once you start writing it

1002
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:24,160
can start once once you start writing it
 

1003
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,150
can start once once you start writing it
down you can start reorganizing it so

1004
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,160
down you can start reorganizing it so
 

1005
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,150
down you can start reorganizing it so
that it makes more sense so that it's

1006
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:28,160
that it makes more sense so that it's
 

1007
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,630
that it makes more sense so that it's
connected in a more effective way see

1008
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:30,640
connected in a more effective way see
 

1009
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,510
connected in a more effective way see
but i'm so

1010
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:31,520
but i'm so
 

1011
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,950
but i'm so
ocd that you just mentioned intelligence

1012
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:34,960
ocd that you just mentioned intelligence
 

1013
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,870
ocd that you just mentioned intelligence
and language emotion

1014
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:36,880
and language emotion
 

1015
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,270
and language emotion
i would start becoming paranoid that the

1016
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:39,280
i would start becoming paranoid that the
 

1017
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,909
i would start becoming paranoid that the
categorization isn't perfect

1018
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:41,919
categorization isn't perfect
 

1019
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,230
categorization isn't perfect
like that i'll become paralyzed

1020
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:46,240
like that i'll become paralyzed
 

1021
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,190
like that i'll become paralyzed
with the mind map that like this may not

1022
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:49,200
with the mind map that like this may not
 

1023
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,510
with the mind map that like this may not
be

1024
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:49,520
be
 

1025
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,310
be
so like the even though you're just

1026
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,320
so like the even though you're just
 

1027
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,990
so like the even though you're just
doing associative kind of

1028
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,000
doing associative kind of
 

1029
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,950
doing associative kind of
connections there's an implied hierarchy

1030
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:56,960
connections there's an implied hierarchy
 

1031
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,310
connections there's an implied hierarchy
that's emerging

1032
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:58,320
that's emerging
 

1033
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,830
that's emerging
and i would start becoming paranoid

1034
00:17:59,830 --> 00:17:59,840
and i would start becoming paranoid
 

1035
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,230
and i would start becoming paranoid
that's not the proper hierarchy

1036
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,240
that's not the proper hierarchy
 

1037
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,630
that's not the proper hierarchy
so you're not just one way to see mind

1038
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:04,640
so you're not just one way to see mind
 

1039
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,590
so you're not just one way to see mind
maps is you're putting

1040
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:05,600
maps is you're putting
 

1041
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,870
maps is you're putting
thoughts on paper it's like a

1042
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:08,880
thoughts on paper it's like a
 

1043
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,029
thoughts on paper it's like a
stream of consciousness but then you can

1044
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:11,039
stream of consciousness but then you can
 

1045
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,270
stream of consciousness but then you can
also start getting paranoid well

1046
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:13,280
also start getting paranoid well
 

1047
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,590
also start getting paranoid well
if is this the right hierarchy sure like

1048
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:15,600
if is this the right hierarchy sure like
 

1049
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,669
if is this the right hierarchy sure like
which it's a mind map it's your mind map

1050
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:17,679
which it's a mind map it's your mind map
 

1051
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,270
which it's a mind map it's your mind map
you're free to draw anything you want

1052
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:19,280
you're free to draw anything you want
 

1053
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,549
you're free to draw anything you want
you're free to draw any connection you

1054
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:20,559
you're free to draw any connection you
 

1055
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,669
you're free to draw any connection you
want and you can

1056
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:21,679
want and you can
 

1057
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,510
want and you can
just make a different mind my opinion is

1058
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:23,520
just make a different mind my opinion is
 

1059
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,190
just make a different mind my opinion is
if you think the central node is not the

1060
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,200
if you think the central node is not the
 

1061
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,150
if you think the central node is not the
right node

1062
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,160
right node
 

1063
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,830
right node
yeah so i suppose there's a fear of

1064
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:27,840
yeah so i suppose there's a fear of
 

1065
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,669
yeah so i suppose there's a fear of
being wrong

1066
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:29,679
being wrong
 

1067
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,909
being wrong
if you want to if you want to organize

1068
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:31,919
if you want to if you want to organize
 

1069
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,590
if you want to if you want to organize
your ideas by

1070
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:33,600
your ideas by
 

1071
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,750
your ideas by
writing down what you think which i

1072
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:35,760
writing down what you think which i
 

1073
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,390
writing down what you think which i
think is is very effective like

1074
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:38,400
think is is very effective like
 

1075
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,590
think is is very effective like
how do you know what you think about

1076
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:39,600
how do you know what you think about
 

1077
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,669
how do you know what you think about
something if you don't write it down

1078
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:41,679
something if you don't write it down
 

1079
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,549
something if you don't write it down
right uh if you do that the thing is

1080
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:44,559
right uh if you do that the thing is
 

1081
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,029
right uh if you do that the thing is
that it

1082
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:45,039
that it
 

1083
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,990
that it
imposes a much more uh syntactic

1084
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,000
imposes a much more uh syntactic
 

1085
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,710
imposes a much more uh syntactic
structure

1086
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:48,720
structure
 

1087
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,789
structure
over your ideas which is not required

1088
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:50,799
over your ideas which is not required
 

1089
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,470
over your ideas which is not required
with mind map so mind map is kind of

1090
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:52,480
with mind map so mind map is kind of
 

1091
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,150
with mind map so mind map is kind of
like a lower level

1092
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,160
like a lower level
 

1093
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,950
like a lower level
more freehand way of organizing your

1094
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:56,960
more freehand way of organizing your
 

1095
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,750
more freehand way of organizing your
thoughts

1096
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:57,760
thoughts
 

1097
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,070
thoughts
and once you've drawn it then you can

1098
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,080
and once you've drawn it then you can
 

1099
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,789
and once you've drawn it then you can
start

1100
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:00,799
start
 

1101
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,669
start
uh actually voicing your thoughts in

1102
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:03,679
uh actually voicing your thoughts in
 

1103
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:04,549
uh actually voicing your thoughts in
terms of you know

1104
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:04,559
terms of you know
 

1105
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,710
terms of you know
paragraphs it's a two-dimensional aspect

1106
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:06,720
paragraphs it's a two-dimensional aspect
 

1107
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,710
paragraphs it's a two-dimensional aspect
of layout too right

1108
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:08,720
of layout too right
 

1109
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,110
of layout too right
yeah and it's it's a kind of flower i

1110
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:11,120
yeah and it's it's a kind of flower i
 

1111
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,750
yeah and it's it's a kind of flower i
guess

1112
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:11,760
guess
 

1113
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,830
guess
you start there's usually you want to

1114
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:13,840
you start there's usually you want to
 

1115
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,750
you start there's usually you want to
start with a central concept

1116
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:15,760
start with a central concept
 

1117
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,470
start with a central concept
yes typically it ends up more like a

1118
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:18,480
yes typically it ends up more like a
 

1119
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,990
yes typically it ends up more like a
subway map so it ends up more like a

1120
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,000
subway map so it ends up more like a
 

1121
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,470
subway map so it ends up more like a
graph

1122
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:20,480
graph
 

1123
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,430
graph
a topological graph without a root note

1124
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:23,440
a topological graph without a root note
 

1125
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:23,990
a topological graph without a root note
yeah so

1126
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,000
yeah so
 

1127
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,430
yeah so
like in a subway map there are some

1128
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:25,440
like in a subway map there are some
 

1129
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,870
like in a subway map there are some
nodes that are more connected than

1130
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:26,880
nodes that are more connected than
 

1131
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,390
nodes that are more connected than
others and there are some nodes that are

1132
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:28,400
others and there are some nodes that are
 

1133
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,669
others and there are some nodes that are
more important than others

1134
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:29,679
more important than others
 

1135
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,110
more important than others
right so there are destinations but

1136
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,120
right so there are destinations but
 

1137
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,110
right so there are destinations but
it's it's not going to be purely like a

1138
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,120
it's it's not going to be purely like a
 

1139
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,310
it's it's not going to be purely like a
tree for instance

1140
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:36,320
tree for instance
 

1141
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,549
tree for instance
yeah it's fascinating to think that if

1142
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:38,559
yeah it's fascinating to think that if
 

1143
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,549
yeah it's fascinating to think that if
there's something to that about our

1144
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:40,559
there's something to that about our
 

1145
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,630
there's something to that about our
about the way our mind thinks by the way

1146
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:42,640
about the way our mind thinks by the way
 

1147
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,870
about the way our mind thinks by the way
i just kind of remembered

1148
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:44,880
i just kind of remembered
 

1149
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,669
i just kind of remembered
obvious thing that i have probably

1150
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:47,679
obvious thing that i have probably
 

1151
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,830
obvious thing that i have probably
thousands of documents in google doc at

1152
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:49,840
thousands of documents in google doc at
 

1153
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,870
thousands of documents in google doc at
this point

1154
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:50,880
this point
 

1155
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,230
this point
that bullet point lists uh

1156
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:54,240
that bullet point lists uh
 

1157
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,350
that bullet point lists uh
which is you can probably map a mine

1158
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:57,360
which is you can probably map a mine
 

1159
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,350
which is you can probably map a mine

it's a tree yeah so i create trees but

1166
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,000
it's a tree yeah so i create trees but
 

1167
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,630
it's a tree yeah so i create trees but
also they don't have the visual element

1168
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:10,640
also they don't have the visual element
 

1169
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,789
also they don't have the visual element

poetically represent a category

poetically represent a category
 

1237
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,190
poetically represent a category
like motion as opposed to saying motion

1238
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:25,200
like motion as opposed to saying motion
 

1239
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,990
like motion as opposed to saying motion
so unfortunately it's that's the same

1240
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:28,000
so unfortunately it's that's the same
 

1241
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,430
so unfortunately it's that's the same
problem with the internet that's why the

00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:29,440
problem with the internet that's why the
 

1243
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,230
problem with the internet that's why the

idea of semantic web is difficult to get
 

1245
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,830
idea of semantic web is difficult to get
it's uh most language on the internet is

00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:35,840
it's uh most language on the internet is
 

1247
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,909
it's uh most language on the internet is
a giant mess

1248
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:37,919
a giant mess
 

1249
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,350
a giant mess
of natural language that's hard to

1250
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:39,360
of natural language that's hard to
 

1251

which so do you think uh do you think

1254
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:43,520
which so do you think uh do you think
 

1255
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,950
which so do you think uh do you think
there's something to mind maps

1256
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:44,960
there's something to mind maps
 

1257
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,830
there's something to mind maps
as um you actually originally brought up

1258
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:47,840
as um you actually originally brought up
 

1259
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,470
as um you actually originally brought up
as we were talking about

1260
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:50,480
as we were talking about
 

1261
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,590
as we were talking about
kind of cognition and language do you

1262
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:53,600
kind of cognition and language do you
 

1263
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,190
kind of cognition and language do you
think there's something to mind maps

1264
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:55,200
think there's something to mind maps
 

1265
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,590
think there's something to mind maps
about how our brain actually

1266
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:57,600
about how our brain actually
 

1267
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,669
about how our brain actually
deals like think reasons about things

1268
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:01,679
deals like think reasons about things
 

1269
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,549
deals like think reasons about things
it's possible i think it's reasonable to

1270
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:04,559
it's possible i think it's reasonable to
 

1271
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,190
it's possible i think it's reasonable to
assume that there is

1272
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:07,200
assume that there is
 

1273
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,070
assume that there is
some level of topological processing in

1274
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,080
some level of topological processing in
 

1275
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,430
some level of topological processing in
the brain that the brain

1276
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:11,440
the brain that the brain
 

1277
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,029
the brain that the brain
is very associative in nature

1278
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:15,039
is very associative in nature
 

1279
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,470
is very associative in nature
and i also believe that

1280
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:18,480
and i also believe that
 

1281
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,750
and i also believe that
a topological space is a better medium

1282
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:23,760

 

1283
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,630

to encode thoughts than a geometric

1284
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:26,640
to encode thoughts than a geometric
 

1285
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,110
to encode thoughts than a geometric
space

1286
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:27,120
space
 

1287
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,950
space
then so i think what's the difference in

1288
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:28,960
then so i think what's the difference in
 

1289
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,950
then so i think what's the difference in
topological and geometric space

1290
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:30,960
topological and geometric space
 

1291
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,789
topological and geometric space
well um if you're talking about

1292
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:32,799
well um if you're talking about
 

1293
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,990
well um if you're talking about
topologies uh

1294
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,000
topologies uh
 

1295
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,070
topologies uh
then points are either connected or not

1296
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,080
then points are either connected or not
 

1297
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,750
then points are either connected or not
so the topology is more like a subway

1298
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:37,760
so the topology is more like a subway
 

1299
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,549
so the topology is more like a subway
map

1300
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:38,559
map
 

1301
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,590
map
and geometry is when you're interested

1302
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:41,600
and geometry is when you're interested
 

1303
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,070
and geometry is when you're interested
in the distance between things and in

1304
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:44,080
in the distance between things and in
 

1305
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,190
in the distance between things and in
subway maps you don't really have the

1306
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:45,200
subway maps you don't really have the
 

1307
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,870
subway maps you don't really have the
concept of distance you only have the

1308
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:46,880
concept of distance you only have the
 

1309
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,310
concept of distance you only have the
concept of whether there is a train

1310
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:48,320
concept of whether there is a train
 

1311
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,830
concept of whether there is a train
going from station a

1312
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:49,840
going from station a
 

1313
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,270
going from station a
to station b and

1314
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:53,280
to station b and
 

1315
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,710
to station b and
what we do in deep learning is that

1316
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:54,720
what we do in deep learning is that
 

1317
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,549
what we do in deep learning is that
we're we're actually dealing with uh

1318
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:56,559
we're we're actually dealing with uh
 

1319
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,310
we're we're actually dealing with uh
geometric spaces we're dealing with

00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:58,320
geometric spaces we're dealing with
 

1321
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,510
geometric spaces we're dealing with
concept vectors

1322
00:22:59,510 --> 00:22:59,520
concept vectors
 

1323
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,630
concept vectors
word vectors uh that have a distance

1324
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:02,640
word vectors uh that have a distance
 

1325
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,110
word vectors uh that have a distance
between

1326
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,120
between

1328
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:04,720
the gist expressed in terms of dot
 

1329
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,470
the gist expressed in terms of dot
product um

1330
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:06,480
product um
 

1331
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,630
product um
we are not we are not really building

1332
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:08,640
we are not we are not really building
 

1333
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,630
we are not we are not really building
topological models usually

1334
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:10,640
topological models usually
 

1335
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,909
topological models usually
i think you're absolutely right like

1336
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:11,919
i think you're absolutely right like
 

1337
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,070
i think you're absolutely right like
distance is a

1338
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,080
distance is a
 

1339
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,390
distance is a
fundamental importance in deep learning

1340
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:16,400
fundamental importance in deep learning
 

1341
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,510
fundamental importance in deep learning
i mean it's the

1342
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:17,520
i mean it's the
 

1343
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,149
i mean it's the
continuous aspect of it yes because

1344
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:20,159
continuous aspect of it yes because
 

1345
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,590
continuous aspect of it yes because
everything is a vector and everything

1346
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:21,600
everything is a vector and everything
 

1347
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,950
everything is a vector and everything
has to be a vector because everything

1348
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:22,960
has to be a vector because everything
 

1349
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,390
has to be a vector because everything
has to be differentiable

1350
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:24,400
has to be differentiable
 

1351
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,149
has to be differentiable
if your space is discrete it's no longer

1352
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:26,159
if your space is discrete it's no longer
 

1353
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,430
if your space is discrete it's no longer
differentiable you cannot do deep

1354
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:27,440
differentiable you cannot do deep
 

1355
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,510
differentiable you cannot do deep
learning in it anymore

1356
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:29,520
learning in it anymore
 

1357
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,270
learning in it anymore
well you could but you could only do it

1358
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:31,280
well you could but you could only do it
 

1359
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,789
well you could but you could only do it
by embedding it in

1360
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:32,799
by embedding it in
 

1361
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:37,029
by embedding it in
a bigger continuous space so if you do

1362
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:37,039
a bigger continuous space so if you do
 

1363
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,950
a bigger continuous space so if you do
topology in the in the context of deep

1364
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:38,960
topology in the in the context of deep
 

1365
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,310
topology in the in the context of deep
learning you have to do it by embedding

1366
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:40,320
learning you have to do it by embedding
 

1367
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,710
learning you have to do it by embedding
your topology in a geometry right yeah

1368
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:42,720
your topology in a geometry right yeah
 

1369
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,269
your topology in a geometry right yeah
well let me uh let me zoom out for a

1370
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:45,279
well let me uh let me zoom out for a
 

1371
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:45,909
well let me uh let me zoom out for a
second

1372
00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:45,919
second
 

1373
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,590
second
uh let's get into your paper on the

1374
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:47,600
uh let's get into your paper on the
 

1375
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,149
uh let's get into your paper on the
measure of intelligence

1376
00:23:50,149 --> 00:23:50,159
measure of intelligence
 

1377
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,269
measure of intelligence
that uh did you put on 2019 yes

1378
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:53,279
that uh did you put on 2019 yes
 

1379
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:57,590
that uh did you put on 2019 yes
okay yeah november november

1380
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:57,600

 

1381
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,549

yeah remember 2018 that was a different

1382
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:00,559
yeah remember 2018 that was a different
 

1383
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,110
yeah remember 2018 that was a different
time

1384
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:01,120
time
 

1385
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,470
time
yeah i remember i still remember

1386
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:06,480

 

1387
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,630

it feels like a different and different

1388
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:08,640
it feels like a different and different
 

1389
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,510
it feels like a different and different
different world

1390
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:09,520
different world
 

1391
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,269
different world
you could travel you can you know

1392
00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:11,279
you could travel you can you know
 

1393
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,950
you could travel you can you know
actually go outside and

1394
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:12,960
actually go outside and
 

1395
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,070
actually go outside and
see friends yeah

1396
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,080
see friends yeah
 

1397
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,029
see friends yeah
let me ask the most absurd question i

1398
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:19,039
let me ask the most absurd question i
 

1399
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:19,350
let me ask the most absurd question i
think

1400
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:19,360
think
 

1401
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,669
think
uh there's some non-zero probability

1402
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:21,679
uh there's some non-zero probability
 

1403
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,269
uh there's some non-zero probability
there'll be a textbook one day

1404
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:23,279
there'll be a textbook one day
 

1405
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,230
there'll be a textbook one day
like 200 years from now on artificial

1406
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:26,240
like 200 years from now on artificial
 

1407
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,590
like 200 years from now on artificial
intelligence

1408
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:27,600
intelligence
 

1409
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,909
intelligence
or it'll be called like just

1410
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:29,919
or it'll be called like just
 

1411
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,430
or it'll be called like just
intelligence because humans will already

1412
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:31,440
intelligence because humans will already
 

1413
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,310
intelligence because humans will already
be gone

1414
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:32,320
be gone
 

1415
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,350
be gone
it'll be your picture with a quote

1416
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:35,360
it'll be your picture with a quote
 

1417
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,390
it'll be your picture with a quote
you know one of the early biological

1418
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:38,400
you know one of the early biological
 

1419
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,669
you know one of the early biological
systems would consider

1420
00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:39,679
systems would consider
 

1421
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,909
systems would consider
the nature of intelligence and they'll

1422
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:41,919
the nature of intelligence and they'll
 

1423
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,750
the nature of intelligence and they'll
be like a definition of how they thought

1424
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:43,760
be like a definition of how they thought
 

1425
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,950
be like a definition of how they thought
about intelligence

1426
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:44,960
about intelligence
 

1427
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,310
about intelligence
which is one of the things you do in

1428
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:46,320
which is one of the things you do in
 

1429
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,310
which is one of the things you do in
your paper on measure intelligence is

1430
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:48,320
your paper on measure intelligence is
 

1431
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,430
your paper on measure intelligence is
to ask like well

1432
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:51,440
to ask like well
 

1433
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,830
to ask like well
what is intelligence and and uh how to

1434
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:53,840
what is intelligence and and uh how to
 

1435
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,430
what is intelligence and and uh how to
test for intelligence and so on

1436
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:55,440
test for intelligence and so on
 

1437
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,549
test for intelligence and so on
so is there a spiffy quote

1438
00:24:58,549 --> 00:24:58,559
so is there a spiffy quote
 

1439
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,750
so is there a spiffy quote
about what is intelligence

1440
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:01,760
about what is intelligence
 

1441
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,830
about what is intelligence
what is the definition of intelligence

1442
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:03,840
what is the definition of intelligence
 

1443
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,710
what is the definition of intelligence
according to francois charley

1444
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:06,720
according to francois charley
 

1445
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,510
according to francois charley
yes so do you think the the

1446
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:09,520
yes so do you think the the
 

1447
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,590
yes so do you think the the
superintendent ais of the future will

1448
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:11,600
superintendent ais of the future will
 

1449
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,230
superintendent ais of the future will
want to remember us do we

1450
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:14,240
want to remember us do we
 

1451
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,470
want to remember us do we
remember humans from the past and do you

1452
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:16,480
remember humans from the past and do you
 

1453
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,669
remember humans from the past and do you
think they would be

1454
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:17,679
think they would be
 

1455
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,750
think they would be
you know they won't be ashamed of having

1456
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:19,760
you know they won't be ashamed of having
 

1457
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,070
you know they won't be ashamed of having
a biology called origin

1458
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,080
a biology called origin
 

1459
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,990
a biology called origin
uh no i i think it would be a niche

1460
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,000
uh no i i think it would be a niche
 

1461
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,909
uh no i i think it would be a niche
topic it won't be that interesting but

1462
00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:25,919
topic it won't be that interesting but
 

1463
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:26,630
topic it won't be that interesting but
it'll be

1464
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:26,640
it'll be
 

1465
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,510
it'll be
it'll be like the people that study in

1466
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:29,520
it'll be like the people that study in
 

1467
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,950
it'll be like the people that study in
certain contexts

1468
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:30,960
certain contexts
 

1469
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,430
certain contexts
like historical civilization that no

1470
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:33,440
like historical civilization that no
 

1471
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,230
like historical civilization that no
longer exist

1472
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:34,240
longer exist
 

1473
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,870
longer exist
the aztecs and so on that that's how

1474
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:36,880
the aztecs and so on that that's how
 

1475
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,149
the aztecs and so on that that's how
it'll be seen

1476
00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:38,159
it'll be seen
 

1477
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,269
it'll be seen
and it'll be studying also the context

1478
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:41,279
and it'll be studying also the context
 

1479
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,870
and it'll be studying also the context
on social media there will be hashtags

1480
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:44,880
on social media there will be hashtags
 

1481
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,350
on social media there will be hashtags
about the atrocity committed to human

1482
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:47,360
about the atrocity committed to human
 

1483
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,710
about the atrocity committed to human
beings

1484
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:48,720
beings
 

1485
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,510
beings
um when when the when the robots finally

1486
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:51,520
um when when the when the robots finally
 

1487
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,070
um when when the when the robots finally
got rid of them

1488
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:54,080
got rid of them
 

1489
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,909
got rid of them
like it was a mistake it'll be seen as a

1490
00:25:55,909 --> 00:25:55,919
like it was a mistake it'll be seen as a
 

1491
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,269
like it was a mistake it'll be seen as a
as a giant mistake but

1492
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:57,279
as a giant mistake but
 

1493
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,310
as a giant mistake but
ultimately in the name of progress and

1494
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:00,320
ultimately in the name of progress and
 

1495
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,149
ultimately in the name of progress and
it created a better world because humans

1496
00:26:02,149 --> 00:26:02,159
it created a better world because humans
 

1497
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,029
it created a better world because humans
were

1498
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:03,039
were
 

1499
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,830
were
uh over consuming the resources and all

1500
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:05,840
uh over consuming the resources and all
 

1501
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,430
uh over consuming the resources and all
they were not very rational and were

1502
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:07,440
they were not very rational and were
 

1503
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,390
they were not very rational and were
destructive

1504
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:08,400
destructive
 

1505
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,590
destructive
in the end in terms of productivity and

1506
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:11,600
in the end in terms of productivity and
 

1507
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,149
in the end in terms of productivity and
putting more love in the world and so

1508
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:14,159
putting more love in the world and so
 

1509
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,590
putting more love in the world and so
within that context there'll be a

1510
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:15,600
within that context there'll be a
 

1511
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,350
within that context there'll be a
chapter about these biological systems

1512
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:17,360
chapter about these biological systems
 

1513
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,350
chapter about these biological systems
seems to have a very detailed vision

1514
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:19,360
seems to have a very detailed vision
 

1515
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,110
seems to have a very detailed vision
of that feature you should write a

1516
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:21,120
of that feature you should write a
 

1517
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,350
of that feature you should write a
sci-fi novel about it i said i'm working

1518
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:23,360
sci-fi novel about it i said i'm working
 

1519
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,990
sci-fi novel about it i said i'm working
i'm working on a sci-fi novel currently

1520
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:26,000
i'm working on a sci-fi novel currently
 

1521
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,510
i'm working on a sci-fi novel currently
yes

1522
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:27,520
yes
 

1523
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,909
yes
yes self-published yeah the definition

1524
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:29,919
yes self-published yeah the definition
 

1525
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,590
yes self-published yeah the definition
of intelligence so

1526
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:31,600
of intelligence so
 

1527
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,630
of intelligence so
intelligence is the efficiency

1528
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:34,640
intelligence is the efficiency
 

1529
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,549
intelligence is the efficiency
with which you acquire new skills

1530
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:38,559
with which you acquire new skills
 

1531
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,350
with which you acquire new skills
at tasks that you did not previously

1532
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:41,360
at tasks that you did not previously
 

1533
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,830
at tasks that you did not previously
know about that you did not prepare for

1534
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:43,840
know about that you did not prepare for
 

1535
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,470
know about that you did not prepare for
all right so it is not intelligence is

1536
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:46,480
all right so it is not intelligence is
 

1537
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,750
all right so it is not intelligence is
not skill itself

1538
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:47,760
not skill itself
 

1539
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,990
not skill itself
it's not what you know it's not what you

1540
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:50,000
it's not what you know it's not what you
 

1541
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,430
it's not what you know it's not what you
can do it's how

1542
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:51,440
can do it's how
 

1543
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,750
can do it's how
well and how efficiently you can learn

1544
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:53,760
well and how efficiently you can learn
 

1545
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,549
well and how efficiently you can learn
new things

1546
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:54,559
new things
 

1547
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,070
new things
new things yes the idea of newness there

1548
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,080
new things yes the idea of newness there
 

1549
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,110
new things yes the idea of newness there
seems to be fundamentally important

1550
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,120
seems to be fundamentally important
 

1551
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,750
seems to be fundamentally important
yes so you would see intelligence on

1552
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:03,760
yes so you would see intelligence on
 

1553
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,669
yes so you would see intelligence on
display for instance

1554
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:05,679
display for instance
 

1555
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,549
display for instance
whenever you see a human being or you

1556
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:08,559
whenever you see a human being or you
 

1557
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,269
whenever you see a human being or you
know an ai

1558
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:09,279
know an ai
 

1559
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,149
know an ai
creature adapt to a new environment that

1560
00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:12,159
creature adapt to a new environment that
 

1561
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,710
creature adapt to a new environment that
it has not seen before that its creators

1562
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:14,720
it has not seen before that its creators
 

1563
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,710
it has not seen before that its creators
did not anticipate

1564
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:16,720
did not anticipate
 

1565
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,389
did not anticipate
when you see adaptation when you see

1566
00:27:18,389 --> 00:27:18,399
when you see adaptation when you see
 

1567
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:19,830
when you see adaptation when you see
improvisation when you see

1568
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:19,840
improvisation when you see
 

1569
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,070
improvisation when you see
generalization that's intelligence

1570
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:22,080
generalization that's intelligence
 

1571
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,389
generalization that's intelligence
uh in reverse if you have a system

1572
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:24,399
uh in reverse if you have a system
 

1573
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:25,750
uh in reverse if you have a system
that's when you put it in a

1574
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:25,760
that's when you put it in a
 

1575
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,710
that's when you put it in a
slightly new environment it cannot adapt

1576
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:28,720
slightly new environment it cannot adapt
 

1577
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,110
slightly new environment it cannot adapt
it cannot improvise it cannot deviate

1578
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,120
it cannot improvise it cannot deviate
 

1579
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,710
it cannot improvise it cannot deviate
from what it's hardcoded to do oh

1580
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:34,720
from what it's hardcoded to do oh
 

1581
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,149
from what it's hardcoded to do oh
what what it has been trying to do

1582
00:27:38,149 --> 00:27:38,159
what what it has been trying to do
 

1583
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,909
what what it has been trying to do
um that is a system that is not

1584
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:39,919
um that is a system that is not
 

1585
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,990
um that is a system that is not
intelligent there's actually a quote

1586
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:42,000
intelligent there's actually a quote
 

1587
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,789
intelligent there's actually a quote
from

1588
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:42,799
from
 

1589
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,070
from
einstein that captures this idea which

1590
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:46,080
einstein that captures this idea which
 

1591
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,710
einstein that captures this idea which
is

1592
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:46,720
is
 

1593
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,789
is
the measure of intelligence is the

1594
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:48,799
the measure of intelligence is the
 

1595
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,630
the measure of intelligence is the
ability to change

1596
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:50,640
ability to change
 

1597
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,110
ability to change
i i like that quote i think it captures

1598
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,120
i i like that quote i think it captures
 

1599
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,870
i i like that quote i think it captures
at least part of this idea

1600
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:54,880
at least part of this idea
 

1601
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,990
at least part of this idea
you know there might be something

1602
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:56,000
you know there might be something
 

1603
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,750
you know there might be something
interesting about the difference between

1604
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:57,760
interesting about the difference between
 

1605
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,430
interesting about the difference between
your definition and einsteins

1606
00:27:59,430 --> 00:27:59,440
your definition and einsteins
 

1607
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,870
your definition and einsteins
i mean he's just being einstein

1608
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:02,880
i mean he's just being einstein
 

1609
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,549
i mean he's just being einstein
and clever but acquisition of

1610
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:08,559
and clever but acquisition of
 

1611
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,870
and clever but acquisition of
new ability to deal with new things

1612
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:12,880
new ability to deal with new things
 

1613
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,269
new ability to deal with new things
versus ability to just change

1614
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:17,279
versus ability to just change
 

1615
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,710
versus ability to just change
what's the difference between those two

1616
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:18,720
what's the difference between those two
 

1617
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,470
what's the difference between those two
things so just

1618
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:20,480
things so just
 

1619
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,789
things so just
changing itself do you think there's

1620
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:22,799
changing itself do you think there's
 

1621
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,389
changing itself do you think there's
something to that

1622
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:24,399
something to that
 

1623
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,669
something to that
just being able to change yes being able

1624
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:27,679
just being able to change yes being able
 

1625
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,029
just being able to change yes being able
to adapt so not

1626
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:29,039
to adapt so not
 

1627
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,070
to adapt so not
not change but certainly uh

1628
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,080
not change but certainly uh
 

1629
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,470
not change but certainly uh
changes direction being able to adapt

1630
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:34,480
changes direction being able to adapt
 

1631
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,190
changes direction being able to adapt
yourself

1632
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:35,200
yourself
 

1633
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,830
yourself
to your environment whatever the

1634
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:37,840
to your environment whatever the
 

1635
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,630
to your environment whatever the
environment that's

1636
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:38,640
environment that's
 

1637
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,789
environment that's
that's a big part of intelligence yes

1638
00:28:40,789 --> 00:28:40,799
that's a big part of intelligence yes
 

1639
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,710
that's a big part of intelligence yes
and intelligence is more precisely you

1640
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:42,720
and intelligence is more precisely you
 

1641
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,350
and intelligence is more precisely you
know

1642
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:43,360
know
 

1643
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,830
know
how efficiently you're able to adapt how

1644
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:45,840
how efficiently you're able to adapt how
 

1645
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,430
how efficiently you're able to adapt how
efficiently you're able to

1646
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:47,440
efficiently you're able to
 

1647
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,190
efficiently you're able to
basically master your environment how

1648
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:49,200
basically master your environment how
 

1649
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,710
basically master your environment how
efficiently

1650
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:50,720
efficiently
 

1651
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,950
efficiently
you can acquire new skills and i think

1652
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:52,960
you can acquire new skills and i think
 

1653
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,549
you can acquire new skills and i think
there's a there's a big distinction to

1654
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:54,559
there's a there's a big distinction to
 

1655
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,669
there's a there's a big distinction to
be drawn

1656
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:55,679
be drawn
 

1657
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,510
be drawn
between intelligence which is a process

1658
00:28:59,510 --> 00:28:59,520
between intelligence which is a process
 

1659
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,310
between intelligence which is a process
and the output of that process which is

1660
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:02,320
and the output of that process which is
 

1661
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,710
and the output of that process which is
skill

1662
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:04,720
skill
 

1663
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,029
skill
so for instance if you have a very smart

1664
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:07,039
so for instance if you have a very smart
 

1665
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,789
so for instance if you have a very smart
human programmer

1666
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:08,799
human programmer
 

1667
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,789
human programmer
that considers the game of chess and

1668
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:10,799
that considers the game of chess and
 

1669
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,269
that considers the game of chess and
that writes down

1670
00:29:13,269 --> 00:29:13,279
that writes down
 

1671
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,149
that writes down
a static program that can play chess

1672
00:29:16,149 --> 00:29:16,159
a static program that can play chess
 

1673
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:16,710
a static program that can play chess
then

1674
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:16,720
then
 

1675
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,269
then
the intelligence is the process of

1676
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:19,279
the intelligence is the process of
 

1677
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,350
the intelligence is the process of
developing that program but the program

1678
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:21,360
developing that program but the program
 

1679
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,470
developing that program but the program
itself

1680
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:22,480
itself
 

1681
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,510
itself
is just encoding

1682
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:25,520
is just encoding
 

1683
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,070
is just encoding
the output artifact of that process the

1684
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:28,080
the output artifact of that process the
 

1685
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,990
the output artifact of that process the
program itself is not intelligent and

1686
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:30,000
program itself is not intelligent and
 

1687
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,830
program itself is not intelligent and
the way you tell it's not intelligent

1688
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:31,840
the way you tell it's not intelligent
 

1689
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,350
the way you tell it's not intelligent
is that if you put it in a different

1690
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:33,360
is that if you put it in a different
 

1691
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,950
is that if you put it in a different
context you ask it to play go or

1692
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:34,960
context you ask it to play go or
 

1693
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,909
context you ask it to play go or
something

1694
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:35,919
something
 

1695
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,430
something
it's not going to be able to perform

1696
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:37,440
it's not going to be able to perform
 

1697
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,269
it's not going to be able to perform
well with human involvement because the

1698
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:39,279
well with human involvement because the
 

1699
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,950
well with human involvement because the
source of intelligence

1700
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:40,960
source of intelligence
 

1701
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,549
source of intelligence
the entity that is capable of that

1702
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:42,559
the entity that is capable of that
 

1703
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,310
the entity that is capable of that
process is the human programmer

1704
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:44,320
process is the human programmer
 

1705
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,350
process is the human programmer
so we should be able to tell the

1706
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:47,360
so we should be able to tell the
 

1707
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,389
so we should be able to tell the
difference between

1708
00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:48,399
difference between
 

1709
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,470
difference between
the process and its output we should not

1710
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:50,480
the process and its output we should not
 

1711
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,830
the process and its output we should not
confuse

1712
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:51,840
confuse
 

1713
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,669
confuse
the output and the process it's the same

1714
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:53,679
the output and the process it's the same
 

1715
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,789
the output and the process it's the same
as you know do not confuse

1716
00:29:56,789 --> 00:29:56,799
as you know do not confuse
 

1717
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,669
as you know do not confuse
a road building company and one specific

1718
00:29:59,669 --> 00:29:59,679
a road building company and one specific
 

1719
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,510
a road building company and one specific
road because one specific road takes you

1720
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:01,520
road because one specific road takes you
 

1721
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,350
road because one specific road takes you
from point a to point b

1722
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:03,360
from point a to point b
 

1723
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,430
from point a to point b
but a road building company can take you

1724
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:05,440
but a road building company can take you
 

1725
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,710
but a road building company can take you
from you can

1726
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:06,720
from you can
 

1727
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,310
from you can
make a path from anywhere to anywhere

1728
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:08,320
make a path from anywhere to anywhere
 

1729
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,149
make a path from anywhere to anywhere
else yeah that's beautifully put but

1730
00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:10,159
else yeah that's beautifully put but
 

1731
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,149
else yeah that's beautifully put but
it's also

1732
00:30:12,149 --> 00:30:12,159
it's also
 

1733
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,350
it's also
to play devil's advocate a little bit

1734
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:15,360
to play devil's advocate a little bit
 

1735
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,070
to play devil's advocate a little bit
you know um it's possible that there's

1736
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,080
you know um it's possible that there's
 

1737
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,710
you know um it's possible that there's
something

1738
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:18,720
something
 

1739
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,230
something
more fundamental than us humans so

1740
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:22,240
more fundamental than us humans so
 

1741
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,430
more fundamental than us humans so
you kind of said the programmer creates

1742
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:25,440
you kind of said the programmer creates
 

1743
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,710
you kind of said the programmer creates
uh the difference between the the choir

1744
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:28,720
uh the difference between the the choir
 

1745
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,350
uh the difference between the the choir
of the skill and the skill itself

1746
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:31,360
of the skill and the skill itself
 

1747
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,870
of the skill and the skill itself
there could be something like you could

1748
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:32,880
there could be something like you could
 

1749
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,110
there could be something like you could
argue the universe

1750
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:35,120
argue the universe
 

1751
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,950
argue the universe
is more intelligent like the the deep

1752
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:38,960
is more intelligent like the the deep
 

1753
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,070
is more intelligent like the the deep
the base intelligence of um that we

1754
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,080
the base intelligence of um that we
 

1755
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,630
the base intelligence of um that we
should be

1756
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:42,640
should be
 

1757
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,149
should be
trying to measure is something that

1758
00:30:44,149 --> 00:30:44,159
trying to measure is something that
 

1759
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,310
trying to measure is something that
created humans

1760
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:46,320
created humans
 

1761
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,990
created humans
we should be measuring god or what

1762
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:50,000
we should be measuring god or what
 

1763
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,870
we should be measuring god or what
the source the universe as opposed to

1764
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:52,880
the source the universe as opposed to
 

1765
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,470
the source the universe as opposed to
like there's there could be a deeper

1766
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:54,480
like there's there could be a deeper
 

1767
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,149
like there's there could be a deeper
intelligence sure there's always deeper

1768
00:30:56,149 --> 00:30:56,159
intelligence sure there's always deeper
 

1769
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,310
intelligence sure there's always deeper
intelligence you can argue that but that

1770
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:58,320
intelligence you can argue that but that
 

1771
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:58,950
intelligence you can argue that but that
does not

1772
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:58,960
does not
 

1773
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,630
does not
take anything away from the fact that

00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:00,640
take anything away from the fact that
 

1775
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,310
take anything away from the fact that
humans are intelligence and you can't

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,350
tell that
because they are capable of adaptation

uh humans are capable of handling
uh situations and tasks that

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,990
uh situations and tasks that
are quite different from anything that

00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,000
are quite different from anything that
 

1793
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,029
are quite different from anything that
any of our

so we are capable of generalizing very

1800
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:26,240
so we are capable of generalizing very
 

1801
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,710
so we are capable of generalizing very
much out of distribution if you consider

we're like mapping the skills we've

00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,430
we're like mapping the skills we've
learned previously

1816
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:41,440
learned previously
 

1817
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,909
learned previously
desperately trying to like jam them into

1818
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:43,919
desperately trying to like jam them into
 

1819
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:44,630
desperately trying to like jam them into
like

1820
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:44,640
like
 

1821
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,350
like
these new situations i mean there's

1822
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:47,360
these new situations i mean there's
 

1823
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,310
these new situations i mean there's
definitely a little bit

1824
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:48,320
definitely a little bit
 

1825
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,310
definitely a little bit
a little bit of that but it's pretty

1826
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:50,320
a little bit of that but it's pretty
 

1827
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,549
a little bit of that but it's pretty
clear to me that we're able to

1828
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:52,559
clear to me that we're able to
 

1829
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,669
clear to me that we're able to
uh you know most of the things we do

1830
00:31:55,669 --> 00:31:55,679
uh you know most of the things we do
 

1831
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,070
uh you know most of the things we do
any given day in our modern civilization

1832
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:58,080
any given day in our modern civilization
 

1833
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,029
any given day in our modern civilization
are things that are

1834
00:31:59,029 --> 00:31:59,039
are things that are
 

1835
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,149
are things that are
very very different from what you know

1836
00:32:02,149 --> 00:32:02,159
very very different from what you know
 

1837
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,990
very very different from what you know
our ancestors a million years ago would

1838
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,000
our ancestors a million years ago would
 

1839
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,990
our ancestors a million years ago would
have been doing in in a given day and

1840
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,000
have been doing in in a given day and
 

1841
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,389
have been doing in in a given day and
your

1842
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:06,399
your
 

1843
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,870
your
environment is very different so i agree

1844
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:08,880
environment is very different so i agree
 

1845
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,990
environment is very different so i agree
that

1846
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:10,000
that
 

1847
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,950
that
um everything we do we do it with

1848
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:12,960
um everything we do we do it with
 

1849
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,149
um everything we do we do it with
cognitive building blocks

1850
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:14,159
cognitive building blocks
 

1851
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,630
cognitive building blocks
that we acquired over the course of

1852
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:16,640
that we acquired over the course of
 

1853
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,350
that we acquired over the course of
revolution

1854
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:17,360
revolution
 

1855
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,950
revolution
right and that anchors um our cognition

1856
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:20,960
right and that anchors um our cognition
 

1857
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,710
right and that anchors um our cognition
to a certain context which is

1858
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:22,720
to a certain context which is
 

1859
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,470
to a certain context which is
the human condition very much but still

1860
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:26,480
the human condition very much but still
 

1861
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,470
the human condition very much but still
our mind is capable of a pretty

remarkable degree of generality
 

1865
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,710
remarkable degree of generality
far beyond anything we can create in

00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:32,720
far beyond anything we can create in
 

1867
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,070
far beyond anything we can create in
artificial systems today

1868
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,080
artificial systems today
 

1869
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,110
artificial systems today
like the degree in which the mind can

and like the key point you're making
 

1889

we shouldn't measure if we talk about

1892
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:57,600
we shouldn't measure if we talk about
 

1893
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,549
we shouldn't measure if we talk about
measurement

1894
00:32:58,549 --> 00:32:58,559
measurement
 

1895
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,909
measurement
we shouldn't measure the skill we should

1896
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:01,919
we shouldn't measure the skill we should
 

1897
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,830
we shouldn't measure the skill we should
measure like the creation of the new

1898
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:03,840
measure like the creation of the new
 

1899
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,230
measure like the creation of the new
skill

1900
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:04,240
skill
 

1901
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,630
skill
the ability to create that new skill yes

1902
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:06,640
the ability to create that new skill yes
 

1903
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,830
the ability to create that new skill yes
but there it's tempting

1904
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:08,840
but there it's tempting
 

1905
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,750
but there it's tempting
like it's weird because the skill

1906
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:11,760
like it's weird because the skill
 

1907
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,909
like it's weird because the skill
is a little bit of a small window into

1908
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:13,919
is a little bit of a small window into
 

1909
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,269
is a little bit of a small window into
the

1910
00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:15,279
the
 

1911
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,110
the
into the system so whenever you have a

1912
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,120
into the system so whenever you have a
 

1913
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,430
into the system so whenever you have a
lot of skills

1914
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:19,440
lot of skills
 

1915
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,750
lot of skills
it's tempting to measure the skills yes

1916
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:21,760
it's tempting to measure the skills yes
 

1917
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,789
it's tempting to measure the skills yes
i mean the skill is the

1918
00:33:22,789 --> 00:33:22,799
i mean the skill is the
 

1919
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,750
i mean the skill is the
uh only thing you can objectively

1920
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:25,760
uh only thing you can objectively
 

1921
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,789
uh only thing you can objectively
measure

1922
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:26,799
measure
 

1923
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,350
measure
but yeah so the the thing to keep in

1924
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:29,360
but yeah so the the thing to keep in
 

1925
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,710
but yeah so the the thing to keep in
mind is that

1926
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:30,720
mind is that
 

1927
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,950
mind is that
when you see skill in the human

1928
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:34,960
when you see skill in the human
 

1929
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,990
when you see skill in the human
it gives you a strong signal that that

1930
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:38,000
it gives you a strong signal that that
 

1931
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,070
it gives you a strong signal that that
human is intelligent because you knew

1932
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:40,080
human is intelligent because you knew
 

1933
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,990
human is intelligent because you knew
they weren't born with that skill

1934
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:42,000
they weren't born with that skill
 

1935
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,990
they weren't born with that skill
typically like you say this you see a

1936
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,000
typically like you say this you see a
 

1937
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,750
typically like you say this you see a
very strong chess player maybe you're a

1938
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:45,760
very strong chess player maybe you're a
 

1939
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,430
very strong chess player maybe you're a
very stronger player yourself

1940
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:47,440
very stronger player yourself
 

1941
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,070
very stronger player yourself
i think you're and you're you're saying

1942
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:50,080
i think you're and you're you're saying
 

1943
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,590
i think you're and you're you're saying
that because i'm russian and now now

1944
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:51,600
that because i'm russian and now now
 

1945
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,070
that because i'm russian and now now
you're

1946
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:52,080
you're
 

1947
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,549
you're
you're prejudiced you assume oh yeah

1948
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:54,559
you're prejudiced you assume oh yeah
 

1949
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:55,269
you're prejudiced you assume oh yeah
it's just biased

1950
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:55,279
it's just biased
 

1951
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,110
it's just biased
i'm biased yeah well you're dead by us

1952
00:33:59,110 --> 00:33:59,120
i'm biased yeah well you're dead by us
 

1953
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,430
i'm biased yeah well you're dead by us
um so if you see a very strong chess

1954
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:01,440
um so if you see a very strong chess
 

1955
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,070
um so if you see a very strong chess
player you know they weren't born

1956
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:04,080
player you know they weren't born
 

1957
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,149
player you know they weren't born
knowing how to play chess so they had to

1958
00:34:06,149 --> 00:34:06,159
knowing how to play chess so they had to
 

1959
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:07,669
knowing how to play chess so they had to
acquire that skill

1960
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:07,679
acquire that skill
 

1961
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,430
acquire that skill
with their limited resources with their

1962
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:09,440
with their limited resources with their
 

1963
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,869
with their limited resources with their
limited lifetime

1964
00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:10,879
limited lifetime
 

1965
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,909
limited lifetime
and you know they did that because they

1966
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:13,919
and you know they did that because they
 

1967
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:15,270
and you know they did that because they
are generally intelligent

1968
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:15,280
are generally intelligent
 

1969
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,750
are generally intelligent
and so they may as well have acquired

1970
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:17,760
and so they may as well have acquired
 

1971
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,669
and so they may as well have acquired
any other skill you know they have this

1972
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:19,679
any other skill you know they have this
 

1973
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,030
any other skill you know they have this
potential

1974
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:21,040
potential
 

1975
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,310
potential
and on the other hand if you see a

1976
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:24,320
and on the other hand if you see a
 

1977
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:24,950
and on the other hand if you see a

1979
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,950
computer
playing a chess you cannot make the same

1980
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:26,960
playing a chess you cannot make the same
 

1981
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,710
playing a chess you cannot make the same
assumptions because you cannot you know

1982
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:28,720
assumptions because you cannot you know
 

1983
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,069
assumptions because you cannot you know
just assume the computer is generally

1984
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:30,079
just assume the computer is generally
 

1985
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:30,710
just assume the computer is generally
intelligent

1986
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:30,720
intelligent
 

1987
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,069
intelligent
the computer may be born knowing

1988
00:34:34,069 --> 00:34:34,079
the computer may be born knowing
 

1989
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,069
the computer may be born knowing
how to play chess in the sense that it

1990
00:34:36,069 --> 00:34:36,079
how to play chess in the sense that it
 

1991
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,270
how to play chess in the sense that it
may have been programmed

1992
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:37,280
may have been programmed
 

1993
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,149
may have been programmed
by a human that has understood chess for

1994
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:40,159
by a human that has understood chess for
 

1995
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,750
by a human that has understood chess for
the computer and and that has just

1996
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:41,760
the computer and and that has just
 

1997
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,950
the computer and and that has just
encoded

1998
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:42,960
encoded
 

1999
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,950
encoded
um the output of that understanding in

2000
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:44,960
um the output of that understanding in
 

2001
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,589
um the output of that understanding in
aesthetic program and that program

2002
00:34:47,589 --> 00:34:47,599
aesthetic program and that program
 

2003
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,389
aesthetic program and that program
is not intelligent so let's zoom out

2004
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:50,399
is not intelligent so let's zoom out
 

2005
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,389
is not intelligent so let's zoom out
just for a second and say like

2006
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:52,399
just for a second and say like
 

2007
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,669
just for a second and say like
what is the goal of the on the measure

2008
00:34:55,669 --> 00:34:55,679
what is the goal of the on the measure
 

2009
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,349
what is the goal of the on the measure
of intelligence paper

2010
00:34:57,349 --> 00:34:57,359
of intelligence paper
 

2011
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,030
of intelligence paper
like what do you hope to achieve with it

2012
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,040
like what do you hope to achieve with it
 

2013
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,470
like what do you hope to achieve with it
so the goal of the paper

2014
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:00,480
so the goal of the paper
 

2015
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,870
so the goal of the paper
is to clear up some long-standing

2016
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:02,880
is to clear up some long-standing
 

2017
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,470
is to clear up some long-standing
misunderstandings

2018
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:04,480
misunderstandings
 

2019
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,510
misunderstandings
about the way we've been conceptualizing

2020
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:07,520
about the way we've been conceptualizing
 

2021
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,589
about the way we've been conceptualizing
intelligence in the ai community and

2022
00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:11,599
intelligence in the ai community and
 

2023
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,510

progress
 

2027
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,750
progress
in ai there's been a lot of progress

2028
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:17,760
in ai there's been a lot of progress
 

2029
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,589
in ai there's been a lot of progress
recently in machine learning and people

2030
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:19,599
recently in machine learning and people
 

2031
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,589
recently in machine learning and people
are you know extrapolating from that

2032
00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:21,599
are you know extrapolating from that
 

2033
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,109
are you know extrapolating from that
progress that we're about

2034
00:35:23,109 --> 00:35:23,119
progress that we're about
 

2035
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,310
progress that we're about
to solve general intelligence

2036
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:26,320
to solve general intelligence
 

2037
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,510
to solve general intelligence
and if you want to be able to evaluate

2038
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:29,520
and if you want to be able to evaluate
 

2039
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,390
and if you want to be able to evaluate
these statements

2040
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:30,400
these statements
 

2041
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,109
these statements
you need to precisely define what you're

2042
00:35:33,109 --> 00:35:33,119
you need to precisely define what you're
 

2043
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,470
you need to precisely define what you're
talking about when you're talking about

2044
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:34,480
talking about when you're talking about
 

2045
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,589
talking about when you're talking about
general intelligence and you need

2046
00:35:37,589 --> 00:35:37,599
general intelligence and you need
 

2047
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,950
general intelligence and you need
a formal way a reliable way to measure

2048
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:40,960
a formal way a reliable way to measure
 

2049
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,589
a formal way a reliable way to measure
how much intelligence how much general

2050
00:35:43,589 --> 00:35:43,599
how much intelligence how much general
 

2051
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,230
how much intelligence how much general
intelligence

2052
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:44,240
intelligence
 

2053
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,670
intelligence
a system processes and ideally this

2054
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:47,680
a system processes and ideally this
 

2055
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,910
a system processes and ideally this
measure of intelligence should be

2056
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:49,920
measure of intelligence should be
 

2057
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,990
measure of intelligence should be
actionable so it should not just

2058
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:52,000
actionable so it should not just
 

2059
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,750
actionable so it should not just
describe

2060
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:53,760
describe
 

2061
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,990
describe
what intelligence is it should not just

2062
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:56,000
what intelligence is it should not just
 

2063
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,990
what intelligence is it should not just
be a binary indicator that tells you

2064
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:58,000
be a binary indicator that tells you
 

2065
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,270
be a binary indicator that tells you
the system is intelligent or it isn't

2066
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:01,280
the system is intelligent or it isn't
 

2067
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,750
the system is intelligent or it isn't
um it should be actionable it should

2068
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:03,760
um it should be actionable it should
 

2069
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,109
um it should be actionable it should
have explanatory

2070
00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:05,119
have explanatory
 

2071
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,990
have explanatory
power right so you could use it as a

2072
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:08,000
power right so you could use it as a
 

2073
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,030
power right so you could use it as a
feedback signal

2074
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:09,040
feedback signal
 

2075
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,750
feedback signal
it would show you uh the way towards

2076
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:11,760
it would show you uh the way towards
 

2077
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,510
it would show you uh the way towards
building more intelligent systems

2078
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:13,520
building more intelligent systems
 

2079
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,310
building more intelligent systems
so at the first level you draw a

2080
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:16,320
so at the first level you draw a
 

2081
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,470
so at the first level you draw a
distinction between two divergent views

2082
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:18,480
distinction between two divergent views
 

2083
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,990
distinction between two divergent views
of intelligence

2084
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:20,000
of intelligence
 

2085
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,270
of intelligence
of um as we just talked about

2086
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:23,280
of um as we just talked about
 

2087
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,190
of um as we just talked about
intelligence is a collection of tax

2088
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:25,200
intelligence is a collection of tax
 

2089
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,030
intelligence is a collection of tax
task specific skills and a general

2090
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:29,040
task specific skills and a general
 

2091
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,710
task specific skills and a general
learning ability so what's the

2092
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:30,720
learning ability so what's the
 

2093
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,790
learning ability so what's the
difference between

2094
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:32,800
difference between
 

2095
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,990
difference between
kind of this memorization of skills

2096
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:36,000
kind of this memorization of skills
 

2097
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,390
kind of this memorization of skills
and a general learning ability we've

2098
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:38,400
and a general learning ability we've
 

2099
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,069
and a general learning ability we've
talked about a little bit but can you

2100
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:40,079
talked about a little bit but can you
 

2101
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,430
talked about a little bit but can you
try to

2102
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:41,440
try to
 

2103
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,430
try to
linger on this topic for a bit yeah so

2104
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:43,440
linger on this topic for a bit yeah so
 

2105
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,950
linger on this topic for a bit yeah so
the first part of the paper

2106
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:44,960
the first part of the paper
 

2107
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,390
the first part of the paper
uh is uh an assessment of the different

2108
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:48,400
uh is uh an assessment of the different
 

2109
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:48,790
uh is uh an assessment of the different
ways

2110
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:48,800
ways
 

2111
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,829
ways
uh we've been thinking about

2112
00:36:49,829 --> 00:36:49,839
uh we've been thinking about
 

2113
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:51,109
uh we've been thinking about
intelligence and the different ways

2114
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:51,119
intelligence and the different ways
 

2115
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,270
intelligence and the different ways
we've been evaluating progress

2116
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:53,280
we've been evaluating progress
 

2117
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,470
we've been evaluating progress
in ai and the history

2118
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:56,480
in ai and the history
 

2119
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,630
in ai and the history
of cognitive sciences has been shaped by

00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:58,640
of cognitive sciences has been shaped by
 

2121
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,589
of cognitive sciences has been shaped by
two views

2122
00:36:59,589 --> 00:36:59,599
two views
 

2123
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,870
two views
of the human mind and one view is the

2124
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:02,880
of the human mind and one view is the
 

2125
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,190
of the human mind and one view is the
evolutionary psychology view in which

2126

evolutionary psychology view in which
 

2127
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,390
evolutionary psychology view in which
the mind

00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:06,400
the mind
 

2129
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,550
the mind
is a collection of fairly static

special purpose ad-hoc mechanisms
 

2133
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,510
special purpose ad-hoc mechanisms
that have been hard coded by evolution

2134
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:17,520
that have been hard coded by evolution
 

2135
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,710
that have been hard coded by evolution
over our our history as a species over a

00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:29,520
ai researchers people like marvin minsky
 

2143
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,230
ai researchers people like marvin minsky
for instance

2144
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:30,240
for instance
 

2145
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,270
for instance
they clearly subscribed to this view

2146
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:33,280
they clearly subscribed to this view
 

2147
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,150
they clearly subscribed to this view
and they saw they saw the mind as a kind

2148
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:36,160
and they saw they saw the mind as a kind
 

2149
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:36,470
and they saw they saw the mind as a kind
of

2150
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:36,480
of
 

2151
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,030
of
you know collection of static programs

2152
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:39,040
you know collection of static programs
 

2153
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,750
you know collection of static programs
uh

2154
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:39,760
uh
 

2155
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,589
uh
similar to the programs they would they

2156
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:41,599
similar to the programs they would they
 

2157
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,510
similar to the programs they would they
would run on like mainframe computers

2158
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:43,520
would run on like mainframe computers
 

2159
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,069
would run on like mainframe computers
and in fact they i think they very much

2160
00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:46,079
and in fact they i think they very much
 

2161
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,589
and in fact they i think they very much
understood the mind

2162
00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:47,599
understood the mind
 

2163
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,910
understood the mind
uh through the metaphor of the mainframe

2164
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:49,920
uh through the metaphor of the mainframe
 

2165
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,750
uh through the metaphor of the mainframe
computer because that was the tool they

2166
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:51,760
computer because that was the tool they
 

2167
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,430
computer because that was the tool they
they were working with right

2168
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:53,440
they were working with right
 

2169
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,109
they were working with right
and so you had the static programs this

2170
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:55,119
and so you had the static programs this
 

2171
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,630
and so you had the static programs this
collection of very different static

2172
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:56,640
collection of very different static
 

2173
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,990
collection of very different static
programs operating over

2174
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:58,000
programs operating over
 

2175
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,470
programs operating over
a database like memory and in this

2176
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:00,480
a database like memory and in this
 

2177
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,510
a database like memory and in this
picture learning was not very important

2178
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:03,520
picture learning was not very important
 

2179
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,950
picture learning was not very important
learning was considered to be just

2180
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:04,960
learning was considered to be just
 

2181
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,589
learning was considered to be just
memorization and in fact

2182
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:07,599
memorization and in fact
 

2183
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,870
memorization and in fact
learning is basically not featured in ai

2184
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:10,880
learning is basically not featured in ai
 

2185
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,790
learning is basically not featured in ai
textbooks until

2186
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:12,800
textbooks until
 

2187
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,829
textbooks until
the 1980s with the rise of machine

2188
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:15,839
the 1980s with the rise of machine
 

2189
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:16,790
the 1980s with the rise of machine
learning

2190
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:16,800
learning
 

2191
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,870
learning
it's kind of fun to think about that

2192
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:18,880
it's kind of fun to think about that
 

2193
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,510
it's kind of fun to think about that
learning was the outcast

2194
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:21,520
learning was the outcast
 

2195
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,910
learning was the outcast
like the the weird people were learning

2196
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:23,920
like the the weird people were learning
 

2197
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,589
like the the weird people were learning
like the mainstream

2198
00:38:25,589 --> 00:38:25,599
like the mainstream
 

2199
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,589
like the mainstream
ai world was um

2200
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:29,599
ai world was um
 

2201
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,109
ai world was um
i mean i don't know what the best term

2202
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:31,119
i mean i don't know what the best term
 

2203
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,829
i mean i don't know what the best term
is but it's non-learning

2204
00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:33,839
is but it's non-learning
 

2205
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,470
is but it's non-learning
it was seen as like reasoning yes would

2206
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:36,480
it was seen as like reasoning yes would
 

2207
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,910
it was seen as like reasoning yes would
not be learning based

2208
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:37,920
not be learning based
 

2209
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,069
not be learning based
yes it was seen it was considered that

2210
00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:40,079
yes it was seen it was considered that
 

2211
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,069
yes it was seen it was considered that
the mind was a collection

2212
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:42,079
the mind was a collection
 

2213
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,430
the mind was a collection
of programs that were primarily

2214
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:45,440
of programs that were primarily
 

2215
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,349
of programs that were primarily
logical in nature and that's all you

2216
00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:47,359
logical in nature and that's all you
 

2217
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,430
logical in nature and that's all you
needed to do to create a mind was to

2218
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:49,440
needed to do to create a mind was to
 

2219
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,190
needed to do to create a mind was to
write down these programs and they would

2220
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:51,200
write down these programs and they would
 

2221
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,710
write down these programs and they would
operate over your knowledge

2222
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:52,720
operate over your knowledge
 

2223
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,390
operate over your knowledge
which would be stored in some kind of

2224
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:54,400
which would be stored in some kind of
 

2225
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,390
which would be stored in some kind of
database and as long as your database

2226
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:56,400
database and as long as your database
 

2227
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,069
database and as long as your database
would encompass you know

2228
00:38:58,069 --> 00:38:58,079
would encompass you know
 

2229
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,829
would encompass you know
everything about the world and your

2230
00:38:59,829 --> 00:38:59,839
everything about the world and your
 

2231
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:02,550
everything about the world and your
logical rules were uh

2232
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:02,560
logical rules were uh
 

2233
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,829
logical rules were uh
comprehensive then you would have in

2234
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:03,839
comprehensive then you would have in
 

2235
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,470
comprehensive then you would have in
mind so the other view of the mind

2236
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:06,480
mind so the other view of the mind
 

2237
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,109
mind so the other view of the mind
is the brain as a sort of blank slate

2238
00:39:11,109 --> 00:39:11,119
is the brain as a sort of blank slate
 

2239
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,510
is the brain as a sort of blank slate
right this is a very old idea you find

2240
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:13,520
right this is a very old idea you find
 

2241
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,710
right this is a very old idea you find
it in

2242
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:14,720
it in
 

2243
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,630
it in
john locke's writings this is the

2244
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:16,640
john locke's writings this is the
 

2245
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,109
john locke's writings this is the
tabulata

2246
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:19,119
tabulata
 

2247
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:21,109
tabulata
and this is this idea that the mind is

2248
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:21,119
and this is this idea that the mind is
 

2249
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,150
and this is this idea that the mind is
some kind of like information sponge

2250
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:24,160
some kind of like information sponge
 

2251
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,190
some kind of like information sponge
that starts empty it starts

2252
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:27,200
that starts empty it starts
 

2253
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,190
that starts empty it starts
blank and that absorbs uh

2254
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:31,200
blank and that absorbs uh
 

2255
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,870
blank and that absorbs uh
knowledge and skills from experience

2256
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:34,880
knowledge and skills from experience
 

2257
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,109
knowledge and skills from experience
right so it's uh it's a sponge that

2258
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:37,119
right so it's uh it's a sponge that
 

2259
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,069
right so it's uh it's a sponge that
reflects

2260
00:39:38,069 --> 00:39:38,079
reflects
 

2261
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,510
reflects
the complexity of the world the

2262
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:39,520
the complexity of the world the
 

2263
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,750
the complexity of the world the
complexity of your life experience

2264
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:41,760
complexity of your life experience
 

2265
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,470
complexity of your life experience
essentially

2266
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:42,480
essentially
 

2267
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,990
essentially
that everything you know and everything

2268
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:44,000
that everything you know and everything
 

2269
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,990
that everything you know and everything
you can do is

2270
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:46,000
you can do is
 

2271
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,550
you can do is
a reflection of something you found in

2272
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:48,560
a reflection of something you found in
 

2273
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,310
a reflection of something you found in
the outside world essentially

2274
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:50,320
the outside world essentially
 

2275
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,109
the outside world essentially
so this is an idea that's very old uh

2276
00:39:53,109 --> 00:39:53,119
so this is an idea that's very old uh
 

2277
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,270
so this is an idea that's very old uh
that was not very popular for instance

2278
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:55,280
that was not very popular for instance
 

2279
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,069
that was not very popular for instance
in the in the 1970s

2280
00:39:58,069 --> 00:39:58,079
in the in the 1970s
 

2281
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,750
in the in the 1970s
but that had gained a lot of vitality

2282
00:39:59,750 --> 00:39:59,760
but that had gained a lot of vitality
 

2283
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,349
but that had gained a lot of vitality
recently with the rise of

2284
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:01,359
recently with the rise of
 

2285
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:02,950
recently with the rise of
connectionism in particular deep

2286
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:02,960
connectionism in particular deep
 

2287
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,510
connectionism in particular deep
learning and so today deep learning is

2288
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:05,520
learning and so today deep learning is
 

2289
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,390
learning and so today deep learning is
the dominant

2290
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:06,400
the dominant
 

2291
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,550
the dominant
paradigm in ai and i feel like lots of

2292
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:10,560
paradigm in ai and i feel like lots of
 

2293
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,510
paradigm in ai and i feel like lots of
ai researchers are conceptualizing the

2294
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:13,520
ai researchers are conceptualizing the
 

2295
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,790
ai researchers are conceptualizing the
mind

2296
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:14,800
mind
 

2297
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,790
mind
via a deep learning metaphor like they

2298
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:16,800
via a deep learning metaphor like they
 

2299
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,069
via a deep learning metaphor like they
see the mind as a kind of

2300
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:20,079
see the mind as a kind of
 

2301
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,150
see the mind as a kind of
randomly initialized neural network that

2302
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:22,160
randomly initialized neural network that
 

2303
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,190
randomly initialized neural network that
starts blank

2304
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:23,200
starts blank

i feel like people who are thinking

2318
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:36,480
i feel like people who are thinking
 

2319
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,390
i feel like people who are thinking
about intelligence

2320
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:38,400
about intelligence
 

2321
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,430
about intelligence
are not conceptualizing it that way i

2322
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:41,440
are not conceptualizing it that way i
 

2323
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:41,910
are not conceptualizing it that way i
actually

00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:41,920
actually
 

2325
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,150
actually
haven't met too many people who believe

2326
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:44,160
haven't met too many people who believe
 

2327
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,309
haven't met too many people who believe
that a neural network

2328
00:40:46,309 --> 00:40:46,319
that a neural network
 

2329
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:49,510
that a neural network
will be able to reason who

2330
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:49,520
will be able to reason who
 

2331
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,670
will be able to reason who
seriously think that rigorously because

00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:51,680
seriously think that rigorously because
 

2333
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,430
seriously think that rigorously because
i think it's actually interesting world

they will
definitely not say that all you need to

00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:23,520
definitely not say that all you need to

definitely not say that all you need to
do is is

do is is

00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,430
do is is
like the mind is just in your network uh

2370
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:27,440
like the mind is just in your network uh
 

2371
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:27,990

you know intellectually lazy about it

2382
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:37,040
you know intellectually lazy about it
 

2383
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,750
you know intellectually lazy about it
right but what i guess what i'm saying

2384
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:39,760
right but what i guess what i'm saying
 

2385
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,030
right but what i guess what i'm saying
exactly right it's

00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:41,040
exactly right it's
 

2387
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,710
exactly right it's
uh i i me i haven't met many people and

2388
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:44,720
uh i i me i haven't met many people and
 

2389
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,550
uh i i me i haven't met many people and
i think it would be interesting

2390
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:46,560
i think it would be interesting
 

2391
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,150
i think it would be interesting
uh to meet a person who is not

2392
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:48,160
uh to meet a person who is not

i think january

2400
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:55,200
i think january
 

2401
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,109
i think january
is probably closest to that there are

00:41:57,109 --> 00:41:57,119
is probably closest to that there are
 

2403
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,390
is probably closest to that there are
definitely people

2404
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:58,400
definitely people
 

2405
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,670
definitely people
who argue that uh

2406
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:01,680
who argue that uh
 

2407
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,270
who argue that uh
current deep learning techniques are

00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:03,280
current deep learning techniques are
 

2409
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,710
current deep learning techniques are
already the way

2410
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:04,720
already the way
 

2411
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,870
already the way
to general artificial intelligence and

2412
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:06,880
to general artificial intelligence and
 

2413
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,069
to general artificial intelligence and
that all you need to do

2414
00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:08,079
that all you need to do
 

2415
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,190
that all you need to do
is to scale it up to all the available

2416
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:11,200
is to scale it up to all the available
 

2417
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,710
is to scale it up to all the available
training data

2418
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:12,720
training data
 

2419
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,150
training data
and that's if you look at the the waves

2420
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:16,160
and that's if you look at the the waves
 

2421

and that's if you look at the the waves
that

there's just a bunch of hype of

there's just a bunch of hype of

there's just a bunch of hype of

different kind that's

reason in in the case of gpt3 which is
 

2447
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:46,390
reason in in the case of gpt3 which is
funny

2448
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:46,400
funny
 

2449
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,470
funny
that there's i believe a couple months

2450
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:48,480
that there's i believe a couple months

2455
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,950

historically correct on that but it

2456
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:56,960
historically correct on that but it
 

2457
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,470
historically correct on that but it
feels like there was a little bit of a

00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:00,480
feels like there was a little bit of a
 

2459
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,470
feels like there was a little bit of a
lack of hype and then there's a phase

2460
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:02,480
lack of hype and then there's a phase
 

2461
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,910
lack of hype and then there's a phase
shift into into

shift into into
 

2463
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,309
shift into into
hype but nevertheless there's a bunch of

2464
00:43:06,309 --> 00:43:06,319
hype but nevertheless there's a bunch of
 

2465
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:07,349
hype but nevertheless there's a bunch of
cool applications

2466
00:43:07,349 --> 00:43:07,359
cool applications
 

2467
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:09,750
cool applications
that seem to captivate the imagination

00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:09,760
that seem to captivate the imagination
 

2469
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,270
that seem to captivate the imagination
of the public about what this

2470
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:11,280
of the public about what this
 

2471
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,510
of the public about what this
language model that's trained in

2472
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:13,520
language model that's trained in
 

2473
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,109
language model that's trained in
unsupervised way

2474
00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:15,119
unsupervised way
 

2475
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,150
unsupervised way
without any fine tuning is able to

2476
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:18,160
without any fine tuning is able to
 

2477
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,510
without any fine tuning is able to
achieve

2478
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:19,520
achieve
 

2479
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,030
achieve
so what do you make of that what are

2480
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:21,040
so what do you make of that what are
 

2481
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,790
so what do you make of that what are
your thoughts about gbt3

2482
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:22,800
your thoughts about gbt3
 

2483
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,390
your thoughts about gbt3
yeah so i think what's interesting about

2484
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:24,400
yeah so i think what's interesting about
 

2485
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,750
yeah so i think what's interesting about
gpg3 is the idea that it may be able

2486
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:27,760
gpg3 is the idea that it may be able
 

2487
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,109
gpg3 is the idea that it may be able
to learn new tasks in

2488
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:31,119
to learn new tasks in
 

2489
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,670
to learn new tasks in
after just being shown a few examples so

2490
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:33,680
after just being shown a few examples so
 

2491
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,950
after just being shown a few examples so
i think if it's actually capable of

2492
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:34,960
i think if it's actually capable of
 

2493
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,589
i think if it's actually capable of
doing that

2494
00:43:35,589 --> 00:43:35,599
doing that
 

2495
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,510
doing that
that's novel and that's very interesting

2496
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:37,520
that's novel and that's very interesting
 

2497
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,309
that's novel and that's very interesting
and that's something we should

2498
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:38,319
and that's something we should
 

2499
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:39,829
and that's something we should
investigate

2500
00:43:39,829 --> 00:43:39,839
investigate
 

2501
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:42,069
investigate
that said i must say i'm not entirely

2502
00:43:42,069 --> 00:43:42,079
that said i must say i'm not entirely
 

2503
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,190
that said i must say i'm not entirely
convinced

2504
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:43,200
convinced
 

2505
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,670
convinced
that we have shown it's it's capable of

2506
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:45,680
that we have shown it's it's capable of
 

2507
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,270
that we have shown it's it's capable of
doing that

2508
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:47,280
doing that
 

2509
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,309
doing that
it's very likely given the amount

2510
00:43:50,309 --> 00:43:50,319
it's very likely given the amount
 

2511
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:52,150
it's very likely given the amount
of data that the model is trained on

2512
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:52,160
of data that the model is trained on
 

2513
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,430
of data that the model is trained on
that what it's actually doing

2514
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:53,440
that what it's actually doing
 

2515
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,710
that what it's actually doing
is pattern matching uh a new task you

2516
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:56,720
is pattern matching uh a new task you
 

2517
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,190
is pattern matching uh a new task you
give it

2518
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:57,200
give it
 

2519
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,349
give it
with the task that it's been exposed to

2520
00:43:59,349 --> 00:43:59,359
with the task that it's been exposed to
 

2521
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,309
with the task that it's been exposed to
in its training data it's just

2522
00:44:00,309 --> 00:44:00,319
in its training data it's just
 

2523
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:01,589
in its training data it's just
recognizing the task

2524
00:44:01,589 --> 00:44:01,599
recognizing the task
 

2525
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,309
recognizing the task
instead of just developing a model of

2526
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:04,319
instead of just developing a model of
 

2527
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:04,950
instead of just developing a model of
the task

2528

the task
 

2529
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,190
the task
right but there's a side to interrupt

2530
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:07,200
right but there's a side to interrupt
 

2531
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,710
right but there's a side to interrupt
there's there's a parallels to what you

2532
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:08,720
there's there's a parallels to what you
 

2533
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,910
there's there's a parallels to what you
said before

2534
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:09,920
said before
 

2535
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,030
said before
which is it's possible to see gpt3

2536
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:13,040
which is it's possible to see gpt3
 

2537
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,829
which is it's possible to see gpt3
as like the prompts that's given as a

2538
00:44:15,829 --> 00:44:15,839
as like the prompts that's given as a
 

2539
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:16,630
as like the prompts that's given as a
kind of

00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:16,640
kind of
 

2541
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,790
kind of
sql query into this thing that it's

which is language is used

2546
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:22,000
which is language is used
 

2547
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,390
which is language is used
to query the memory yes so is it

2548
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:24,400
to query the memory yes so is it
 

2549
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,069
to query the memory yes so is it
possible that

2550
00:44:26,069 --> 00:44:26,079
possible that
 

2551
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,390
possible that
neural network is a giant memorization

2552
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:28,400
neural network is a giant memorization
 

2553
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,109
neural network is a giant memorization
thing

2554
00:44:29,109 --> 00:44:29,119
thing
 

2555
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,150
thing
but then if it gets sufficiently giant

2556
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:32,160
but then if it gets sufficiently giant
 

2557
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,550
but then if it gets sufficiently giant
it'll memorize sufficiently large

2558
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:34,560
it'll memorize sufficiently large
 

2559
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,230
it'll memorize sufficiently large
amounts of thing in the world

2560
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:36,240
amounts of thing in the world
 

2561
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,470
amounts of thing in the world
where it becomes more intelligence

2562
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:38,480
where it becomes more intelligence
 

2563
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,390
where it becomes more intelligence
becomes a querying machine

2564
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:40,400
becomes a querying machine
 

2565
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,950
becomes a querying machine
i think it's possible that uh a

2566
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:42,960
i think it's possible that uh a
 

2567
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,030
i think it's possible that uh a
significant chunk of intelligence

2568
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:45,040
significant chunk of intelligence
 

2569
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,630
significant chunk of intelligence
is this giant associative memory uh

2570
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:48,640
is this giant associative memory uh
 

2571
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,630
is this giant associative memory uh
i definitely don't believe that

2572
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:50,640
i definitely don't believe that
 

2573
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,150
i definitely don't believe that
intelligence is just

2574
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:52,160
intelligence is just
 

2575
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,390
intelligence is just
a giant issue of memory but it may well

2576
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:54,400
a giant issue of memory but it may well
 

2577
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,589
a giant issue of memory but it may well
be a big component

2578
00:44:57,589 --> 00:44:57,599
be a big component
 

2579
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,790
be a big component
so do you think gpt 3

2580
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:00,800
so do you think gpt 3
 

2581
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,589
so do you think gpt 3
4 5 gpt 10 will eventually

2582
00:45:05,589 --> 00:45:05,599
4 5 gpt 10 will eventually
 

2583
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,589
4 5 gpt 10 will eventually
like what do you think where's the

2584
00:45:07,589 --> 00:45:07,599
like what do you think where's the
 

2585
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,589
like what do you think where's the
ceiling do you think you'll be able to

2586
00:45:09,589 --> 00:45:09,599
ceiling do you think you'll be able to
 

2587
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:14,470
ceiling do you think you'll be able to
reason um no that's a bad question uh

2588
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:14,480
reason um no that's a bad question uh
 

2589
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,069
reason um no that's a bad question uh
like what is the ceiling is the better

2590
00:45:16,069 --> 00:45:16,079
like what is the ceiling is the better
 

2591
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,470
like what is the ceiling is the better
question how well is it going to scale

2592
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:18,480
question how well is it going to scale
 

2593
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,990
question how well is it going to scale
how good is gptn going to be yeah

2594
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:22,000
how good is gptn going to be yeah
 

2595
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,349
how good is gptn going to be yeah
so i believe gptn is going to

2596
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:25,359
so i believe gptn is going to
 

2597
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,990
so i believe gptn is going to
chiptn is going to improve on the

2598
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:28,000
chiptn is going to improve on the
 

2599
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,589
chiptn is going to improve on the
strength

2600
00:45:29,589 --> 00:45:29,599
strength
 

2601
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:32,309
strength
of gpt2 and 3 which is it will be able

2602
00:45:32,309 --> 00:45:32,319
of gpt2 and 3 which is it will be able
 

2603
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:34,150
of gpt2 and 3 which is it will be able
to generate you know

2604
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:34,160
to generate you know
 

2605
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,750
to generate you know
ever more plausible text in context just

2606
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:37,760
ever more plausible text in context just
 

2607
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,470
ever more plausible text in context just
monitoring

2608
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:38,480
monitoring
 

2609
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,670
monitoring
the process performance um yes

2610
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:41,680
the process performance um yes
 

2611
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,190
the process performance um yes
if you train if you're training bigger

2612
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:43,200
if you train if you're training bigger
 

2613
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,190
if you train if you're training bigger
more on more data then

2614
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:45,200
more on more data then
 

2615
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,150
more on more data then
your text will be increasingly more

2616
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:48,160
your text will be increasingly more
 

2617
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,270
your text will be increasingly more
context aware

2618
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:49,280
context aware
 

2619
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,349
context aware
and increasingly more plausible in the

2620
00:45:51,349 --> 00:45:51,359
and increasingly more plausible in the
 

2621
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:52,790
and increasingly more plausible in the
same way that gpd3

2622
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:52,800
same way that gpd3
 

2623
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,190
same way that gpd3
it is much better at generating

2624
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:55,200
it is much better at generating
 

2625
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,870
it is much better at generating
clausable text compared to gpd2

2626
00:45:58,870 --> 00:45:58,880
clausable text compared to gpd2
 

2627
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,109
clausable text compared to gpd2
but that said i don't think just getting

2628
00:46:01,109 --> 00:46:01,119
but that said i don't think just getting
 

2629
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:01,990
but that said i don't think just getting
up

2630
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:02,000
up
 

2631
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,710
up
uh the model to more transformer layers

2632
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:04,720
uh the model to more transformer layers
 

2633
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,230
uh the model to more transformer layers
and more train data is going to address

2634
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:06,240
and more train data is going to address
 

2635
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,430
and more train data is going to address
the flaws

2636
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:07,440
the flaws
 

2637
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,309
the flaws
lgbt3 which is that it can generate

2638
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:10,319
lgbt3 which is that it can generate
 

2639
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,470
lgbt3 which is that it can generate
plausible text but that text is

2640
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:12,480
plausible text but that text is
 

2641
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,270
plausible text but that text is
not constrained by anything else other

2642
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:15,280
not constrained by anything else other
 

2643
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,470
not constrained by anything else other
than plausibility

2644
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:16,480
than plausibility
 

2645
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,190
than plausibility
so in particular it's not constrained by

2646
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:19,200
so in particular it's not constrained by
 

2647
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,470
so in particular it's not constrained by
factualness

2648
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:20,480
factualness
 

2649
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,550
factualness
uh or even consistency which is why it's

2650
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:22,560
uh or even consistency which is why it's
 

2651
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,790
uh or even consistency which is why it's
very easy to get gpt3 to generate

2652
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:24,800
very easy to get gpt3 to generate
 

2653
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,150
very easy to get gpt3 to generate
statements that are

2654
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:26,160
statements that are
 

2655
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,630
statements that are
factually untrue uh or to general

2656
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:28,640
factually untrue uh or to general
 

2657
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,630
factually untrue uh or to general
statements that are even

2658
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:29,640
statements that are even
 

2659
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,950
statements that are even
self-contradictory

2660
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:30,960
self-contradictory
 

2661
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,150
self-contradictory
right uh because it's uh it's it's

2662
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:34,160
right uh because it's uh it's it's
 

2663
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,349
right uh because it's uh it's it's
only goal is plausibility and it has no

2664
00:46:37,349 --> 00:46:37,359
only goal is plausibility and it has no
 

2665
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:38,950
only goal is plausibility and it has no
other constraints

2666
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:38,960
other constraints
 

2667
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,230
other constraints
it's not constrained to be

2668
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:40,240
it's not constrained to be
 

2669
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,390
it's not constrained to be
self-consistent for instance right

2670
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:42,400
self-consistent for instance right
 

2671
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,790
self-consistent for instance right
and so for this reason one thing that i

2672
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:44,800
and so for this reason one thing that i
 

2673
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,630
and so for this reason one thing that i
thought was very interesting with gpd3

2674
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:46,640
thought was very interesting with gpd3
 

2675
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,349
thought was very interesting with gpd3
is that

2676
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:47,359
is that
 

2677
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:50,230
is that
you can present mind the answer it will

2678
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:50,240
you can present mind the answer it will
 

2679
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,190
you can present mind the answer it will
give you

2680
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:51,200
give you
 

2681
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,430
give you
by asking the question in specific way

2682
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:53,440
by asking the question in specific way
 

2683
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,349
by asking the question in specific way
because it's very responsive to the way

2684
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:55,359
because it's very responsive to the way
 

2685
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:58,790
because it's very responsive to the way
you ask the question since it has

2686
00:46:58,790 --> 00:46:58,800
you ask the question since it has
 

2687
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,109
you ask the question since it has
no understanding of the content of the

2688
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:01,119
no understanding of the content of the
 

2689
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,430
no understanding of the content of the

2690
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:03,440
question right
 

2691
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,829
question right
and if you if you ask the same question

2692
00:47:05,829 --> 00:47:05,839
and if you if you ask the same question
 

2693
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:07,750
and if you if you ask the same question
in two different ways that are

00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:07,760
in two different ways that are
 

2695
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,630
in two different ways that are
basically adversarially engineered to

two different answers to contractor
 

2701
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,550
two different answers to contractor
answers it's very susceptible to

00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,309
in in general
the problem with these models is

2710
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:22,319
the problem with these models is
 

2711
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,309
the problem with these models is
generative models is that

2712
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:24,319
generative models is that
 

2713
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:25,829
generative models is that
they are very good at generating

2714
00:47:25,829 --> 00:47:25,839
they are very good at generating
 

2715
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,230
they are very good at generating
plausible text but that's just

2716
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:28,240
plausible text but that's just
 

2717
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,990
plausible text but that's just
that's just not enough right um

2718
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:32,000
that's just not enough right um
 

2719
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,950
that's just not enough right um
you need uh i think one one avenue that

2720
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:34,960
you need uh i think one one avenue that
 

2721
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:35,910
you need uh i think one one avenue that
would be very

2722
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:35,920
would be very
 

2723
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,390
would be very
interesting to make progress is to make

2724
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:38,400
interesting to make progress is to make
 

2725
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,710
interesting to make progress is to make
it possible

2726
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:40,720
it possible
 

2727
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,750
it possible
to write programs over the latent space

2728
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:43,760
to write programs over the latent space
 

2729
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,910
to write programs over the latent space
that these models operate on that you

2730
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:45,920
that these models operate on that you
 

2731
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,790
that these models operate on that you
would rely

2732
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:46,800
would rely
 

2733
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,510
would rely
on these self-supervised models to

2734
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:49,520
on these self-supervised models to
 

2735
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,510
on these self-supervised models to
generate a sort of flag

2736
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:51,520
generate a sort of flag
 

2737
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,390
generate a sort of flag
pool of knowledge and concepts and

2738
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:54,400
pool of knowledge and concepts and
 

2739
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,150
pool of knowledge and concepts and
common sense and then you will be able

2740
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:56,160
common sense and then you will be able
 

2741
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,190
common sense and then you will be able
to write

2742
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:57,200
to write
 

2743
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:01,109
to write
explicit uh reasoning programs over it

2744
00:48:01,109 --> 00:48:01,119
explicit uh reasoning programs over it
 

2745
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,030
explicit uh reasoning programs over it
uh because the current problem with gpt

2746
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:03,040
uh because the current problem with gpt
 

2747
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,230
uh because the current problem with gpt
stream is that you

2748
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:04,240
stream is that you
 

2749
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,870
stream is that you
it's it can be quite difficult to get it

2750
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:06,880
it's it can be quite difficult to get it
 

2751
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:07,829
it's it can be quite difficult to get it
to

2752
00:48:07,829 --> 00:48:07,839
to
 

2753
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,790
to
do what you want to do if you want to

2754
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:10,800
do what you want to do if you want to
 

2755
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,030
do what you want to do if you want to
turn gpd3 into products you need to put

2756
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:13,040
turn gpd3 into products you need to put
 

2757
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,790
turn gpd3 into products you need to put
constraints on it

2758
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:14,800
constraints on it
 

2759
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,910
constraints on it
you need to um force it to

2760
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:17,920
you need to um force it to
 

2761
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,390
you need to um force it to
obey certain rules so you need a way to

2762
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:20,400
obey certain rules so you need a way to
 

2763
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,390
obey certain rules so you need a way to
program it explicitly

2764
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:22,400
program it explicitly
 

2765
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,390
program it explicitly
yeah so if you look at its ability to do

2766
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:24,400
yeah so if you look at its ability to do
 

2767
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,069
yeah so if you look at its ability to do
program synthesis

2768
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:26,079
program synthesis
 

2769
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:27,510
program synthesis
it generates like you said something

2770
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:27,520
it generates like you said something
 

2771
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,589
it generates like you said something
that's plausible yeah so

2772
00:48:29,589 --> 00:48:29,599
that's plausible yeah so
 

2773
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,910
that's plausible yeah so
if you if you try to make it generate

2774
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:31,920
if you if you try to make it generate
 

2775
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,710
if you if you try to make it generate
programs it will perform well

2776
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:34,720
programs it will perform well
 

2777
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,190
programs it will perform well
for any program that it has seen it in

2778
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:37,200
for any program that it has seen it in
 

2779
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,630
for any program that it has seen it in
its training data

2780
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:38,640
its training data
 

2781
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,270
its training data
but because uh program space is not

2782
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:41,280
but because uh program space is not
 

2783
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,390
but because uh program space is not
interpretive

2784
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:42,400
interpretive
 

2785
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,430
interpretive
right um it's not going to be able to

2786
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:45,440
right um it's not going to be able to
 

2787
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,270
right um it's not going to be able to
generalize to problems it hasn't seen

2788
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:47,280
generalize to problems it hasn't seen
 

2789
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,630
generalize to problems it hasn't seen
before

2790
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:48,640
before
 

2791
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,950
before

00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,510
sounds like a bad plan so from my
personal experience working with

2954
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:39,520
personal experience working with
 

2955
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,630
personal experience working with
a large scale deep learning models

2956
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:42,640
a large scale deep learning models
 

2957
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,190
a large scale deep learning models
so at some point i was working on a

2958
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:45,200
so at some point i was working on a
 

2959
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,470
so at some point i was working on a
model at google

2960
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:46,480
model at google
 

2961
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,790
model at google
that's trained on extra 150 million

2962
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:50,800
that's trained on extra 150 million
 

2963
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,270
that's trained on extra 150 million
labeled images it's image classification

2964
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:53,280
labeled images it's image classification
 

2965
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,990
labeled images it's image classification
model that's a lot of images that's like

2966
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:56,000
model that's a lot of images that's like
 

2967
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,069
model that's a lot of images that's like
probably most publicly available images

2968
00:51:58,069 --> 00:51:58,079
probably most publicly available images
 

2969
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,870
probably most publicly available images
on the web at the time

2970
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:00,880
on the web at the time
 

2971
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,069
on the web at the time
and it was a very noisy data set because

2972
00:52:04,069 --> 00:52:04,079
and it was a very noisy data set because
 

2973
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:04,950
and it was a very noisy data set because
the labels

2974
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:04,960
the labels
 

2975
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,910
the labels
were not originally annotated by hand by

2976
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:07,920
were not originally annotated by hand by
 

2977
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,069
were not originally annotated by hand by
humans they were

2978
00:52:10,069 --> 00:52:10,079
humans they were
 

2979
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:12,390
humans they were
automatically derived from like tags on

2980
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:12,400
automatically derived from like tags on
 

2981
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,150
automatically derived from like tags on
social media

2982
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:14,160
social media
 

2983
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,870
social media
or just keywords in in the same page as

2984
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:16,880
or just keywords in in the same page as
 

2985
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,390
or just keywords in in the same page as
the image was fun and so on so it was

2986
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:18,400
the image was fun and so on so it was
 

2987
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,829
the image was fun and so on so it was
very noisy and

2988
00:52:19,829 --> 00:52:19,839
very noisy and
 

2989
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,630
very noisy and
it turned out that you could uh easily

2990
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:22,640
it turned out that you could uh easily
 

2991
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,030
it turned out that you could uh easily
get

2992
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:23,040
get
 

2993
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,390
get
a better model uh not just by training

2994
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:26,400
a better model uh not just by training
 

2995
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,390
a better model uh not just by training
like if you train on more

2996
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:28,400
like if you train on more
 

2997
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,309
like if you train on more
of the noisy data you get an

2998
00:52:30,309 --> 00:52:30,319
of the noisy data you get an
 

2999
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:32,150
of the noisy data you get an
incrementally better model but you

3000
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:32,160
incrementally better model but you
 

3001
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,870
incrementally better model but you
you you very quickly hit diminishing

3002
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:34,880
you you very quickly hit diminishing
 

3003
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,549
you you very quickly hit diminishing
returns on the other hand

3004
00:52:36,549 --> 00:52:36,559
returns on the other hand
 

3005
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:38,470
returns on the other hand
if you try on smaller data set with

3006
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:38,480
if you try on smaller data set with
 

3007
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,549
if you try on smaller data set with
higher quality annotations quality that

3008
00:52:40,549 --> 00:52:40,559
higher quality annotations quality that
 

3009
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:41,910
higher quality annotations quality that
are

3010
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:41,920
are
 

3011
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,790
are
annotations that are actually made by

3012
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:44,800
annotations that are actually made by
 

3013
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,990
annotations that are actually made by
humans you get a better

3014
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:46,000
humans you get a better
 

3015
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,549
humans you get a better
model and it also takes you know less

3016
00:52:48,549 --> 00:52:48,559
model and it also takes you know less
 

3017
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:49,750
model and it also takes you know less
time to train it

3018
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:49,760
time to train it
 

3019
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,750
time to train it
uh yeah that's fascinating it's the

3020
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:51,760
uh yeah that's fascinating it's the
 

3021
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,950
uh yeah that's fascinating it's the
self-supervised

3022
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:52,960
self-supervised
 

3023
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,109
self-supervised
learnings there's a way to get better

3024
00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:55,119
learnings there's a way to get better
 

3025
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:57,589
learnings there's a way to get better
doing the automated

3026
00:52:57,589 --> 00:52:57,599
doing the automated
 

3027
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,950
doing the automated
labeling yeah so you can

3028
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:00,960
labeling yeah so you can
 

3029
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,549
labeling yeah so you can
enrich or refine your labels

3030
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:04,559
enrich or refine your labels
 

3031
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:07,430
enrich or refine your labels
in an automated way that's correct do

3032
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:07,440
in an automated way that's correct do
 

3033
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,549
in an automated way that's correct do
you have a hope for um

3034
00:53:08,549 --> 00:53:08,559
you have a hope for um
 

3035
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:09,589
you have a hope for um
i don't know if you're familiar with the

3036
00:53:09,589 --> 00:53:09,599
i don't know if you're familiar with the
 

3037
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:11,829
i don't know if you're familiar with the
idea of a semantic web

3038
00:53:11,829 --> 00:53:11,839
idea of a semantic web
 

3039
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:13,990
idea of a semantic web
is this a semantic web just for people

3040
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:14,000
is this a semantic web just for people
 

3041
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,510
is this a semantic web just for people
who are not familiar

3042
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:15,520
who are not familiar
 

3043
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,950
who are not familiar
and is uh is the idea of being able to

00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:18,960
and is uh is the idea of being able to
 

3045
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,750
and is uh is the idea of being able to
convert

3046
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:19,760
convert
 

3047
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,870
convert

to be able to contr convert information

3058
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:33,040
to be able to contr convert information
 

3059
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,790
to be able to contr convert information
on the internet or some fraction of the

interpretable by machines
 

3065
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,069
interpretable by machines
that was kind of a dream

3066
00:53:42,069 --> 00:53:42,079
that was kind of a dream
 

3067
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,430
that was kind of a dream
for um i think the the semantic white

3068
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:45,440
for um i think the the semantic white
 

3069
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,829
for um i think the the semantic white
papers in the 90s

3070
00:53:47,829 --> 00:53:47,839
papers in the 90s
 

3071
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:49,750
papers in the 90s
it's kind of the dream that you know the

3072
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:49,760
it's kind of the dream that you know the
 

3073
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,670
it's kind of the dream that you know the
internet is full of rich exciting

3074
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:51,680
internet is full of rich exciting
 

3075
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,549
internet is full of rich exciting
information even

3076
00:53:52,549 --> 00:53:52,559
information even
 

3077
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:54,710
information even
just looking at wikipedia we should be

3078
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:54,720
just looking at wikipedia we should be
 

3079
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,230
just looking at wikipedia we should be
able to use that

3080
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:56,240
able to use that
 

3081
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,470
able to use that
as data for machines and so information

3082
00:53:58,470 --> 00:53:58,480
as data for machines and so information
 

3083
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,990
as data for machines and so information
is not it's not really in a format

3084
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:00,000
is not it's not really in a format
 

3085
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,750
is not it's not really in a format
that's available to machines so no i

3086
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:01,760
that's available to machines so no i
 

3087
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,829
that's available to machines so no i
don't think the semantic web will

3088
00:54:03,829 --> 00:54:03,839
don't think the semantic web will
 

3089
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:06,470
don't think the semantic web will
ever work simply because it would be a

3090
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:06,480
ever work simply because it would be a
 

3091
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,589
ever work simply because it would be a
lot of work

3092
00:54:07,589 --> 00:54:07,599
lot of work
 

3093
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,990
lot of work
right to make to provide that

3094
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:10,000
right to make to provide that
 

3095
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,910
right to make to provide that
information in structured form

3096
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:11,920
information in structured form
 

3097
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,750
information in structured form
and there is not really any incentive

3098
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:13,760
and there is not really any incentive
 

3099
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,990
and there is not really any incentive
for anyone to provide that work

3100
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:16,000
for anyone to provide that work
 

3101
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,470
for anyone to provide that work
uh so i think the the way forward to

3102
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:18,480
uh so i think the the way forward to
 

3103
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,470
uh so i think the the way forward to
make

3104
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:20,480
make
 

3105
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,230
make
the knowledge on the web available to

3106
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:22,240
the knowledge on the web available to
 

3107
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,990
the knowledge on the web available to
machines is actually

3108
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:24,000
machines is actually
 

3109
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,990
machines is actually
something closer to unsupervised deep

3110
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:26,000
something closer to unsupervised deep
 

3111
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,109
something closer to unsupervised deep
learning

3112
00:54:29,109 --> 00:54:29,119

 

3113
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:31,349

yeah the gpg 3 is actually a bigger step

3114
00:54:31,349 --> 00:54:31,359
yeah the gpg 3 is actually a bigger step
 

3115
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:33,030
yeah the gpg 3 is actually a bigger step
in the direction of making the knowledge

3116
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:33,040
in the direction of making the knowledge
 

3117
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,790
in the direction of making the knowledge
of the web available to machines

3118
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:34,800
of the web available to machines
 

3119
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,150
of the web available to machines
than the semantic web was yeah perhaps

3120
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:38,160
than the semantic web was yeah perhaps
 

3121
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,630
than the semantic web was yeah perhaps
in a human-centric sense it it feels

3122
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:40,640
in a human-centric sense it it feels
 

3123
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:41,990
in a human-centric sense it it feels
like

3124
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:42,000
like
 

3125
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,349
like
gpt-3 hasn't learned

3126
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:45,359
gpt-3 hasn't learned
 

3127
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:48,470
gpt-3 hasn't learned
anything that could be used

3128
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:48,480
anything that could be used
 

3129
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,990
anything that could be used
to reason but that might be just the

3130
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:52,000
to reason but that might be just the
 

3131
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:52,870
to reason but that might be just the
early days

3132
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:52,880
early days
 

3133
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,630
early days
yeah i think that's correct i think the

3134
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:54,640
yeah i think that's correct i think the
 

3135
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,069
yeah i think that's correct i think the
forms of reasoning that you

3136
00:54:56,069 --> 00:54:56,079
forms of reasoning that you
 

3137
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:58,789
forms of reasoning that you
that you see it perform are basically

3138
00:54:58,789 --> 00:54:58,799
that you see it perform are basically
 

3139
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:00,069
that you see it perform are basically
just reproducing

3140
00:55:00,069 --> 00:55:00,079
just reproducing
 

3141
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,309
just reproducing
patterns that it has seen in string data

3142
00:55:02,309 --> 00:55:02,319
patterns that it has seen in string data
 

3143
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:03,990
patterns that it has seen in string data
so of course if you're trained on

3144
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:04,000
so of course if you're trained on
 

3145
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,270
so of course if you're trained on
uh the entire web then you

3146
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:07,280
uh the entire web then you
 

3147
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,510
uh the entire web then you
can produce an illusion of reasoning in

3148
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:09,520
can produce an illusion of reasoning in
 

3149
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,190
can produce an illusion of reasoning in
many different situations but it will

3150
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:11,200
many different situations but it will
 

3151
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:11,910
many different situations but it will
break down

3152
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:11,920
break down
 

3153
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,549
break down
if it's presented with a novel uh

3154
00:55:14,549 --> 00:55:14,559
if it's presented with a novel uh
 

3155
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:15,190
if it's presented with a novel uh
situation

3156
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:15,200
situation
 

3157
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,710
situation
that's the opening question between the

3158
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:16,720
that's the opening question between the
 

3159
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,990
that's the opening question between the
illusion of reasoning and actual

3160
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:18,000
illusion of reasoning and actual
 

3161
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:18,710
illusion of reasoning and actual
reasoning

3162
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:18,720
reasoning
 

3163
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,270
reasoning
yes the power to adapt to something that

3164
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:21,280
yes the power to adapt to something that
 

3165
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,630
yes the power to adapt to something that
is genuinely new

3166
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:22,640
is genuinely new
 

3167
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,349
is genuinely new
because the thing is even imagine you

3168
00:55:25,349 --> 00:55:25,359
because the thing is even imagine you
 

3169
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:25,750
because the thing is even imagine you
had

3170
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:25,760
had
 

3171
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,510
had
uh you could train on

3172
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:29,520
uh you could train on
 

3173
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,710
uh you could train on
every bit of data ever generated

3174
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:32,720
every bit of data ever generated
 

3175
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:36,630
every bit of data ever generated
in history of humanity uh it remains

3176
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:36,640
in history of humanity uh it remains
 

3177
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,589
in history of humanity uh it remains
so that model would be capable of of

3178
00:55:39,589 --> 00:55:39,599
so that model would be capable of of
 

3179
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:40,950
so that model would be capable of of
anticipating

3180
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:40,960
anticipating
 

3181
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,109
anticipating
uh many different possible situations

3182
00:55:43,109 --> 00:55:43,119
uh many different possible situations
 

3183
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:44,870
uh many different possible situations
but it remains that

3184
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:44,880
but it remains that
 

3185
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,230
but it remains that
the future is going to be something

3186
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:46,240
the future is going to be something
 

3187
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,870
the future is going to be something
different like

3188
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:48,880
different like
 

3189
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,789
different like
for instance if you train a gpt stream

3190
00:55:50,789 --> 00:55:50,799
for instance if you train a gpt stream
 

3191
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:52,150
for instance if you train a gpt stream
model on

3192
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:52,160
model on
 

3193
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,670
model on
on data from the year 2002 for instance

3194
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:55,680
on data from the year 2002 for instance
 

3195
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,190
on data from the year 2002 for instance
and then use it today it's going to be

3196
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:57,200
and then use it today it's going to be
 

3197
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,549
and then use it today it's going to be
missing many things it's going to be

3198
00:55:58,549 --> 00:55:58,559
missing many things it's going to be
 

3199
00:55:58,559 --> 00:55:59,270
missing many things it's going to be
missing many

3200
00:55:59,270 --> 00:55:59,280
missing many
 

3201
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,630
missing many
common sense facts about the world

3202
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:02,640
common sense facts about the world
 

3203
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,549
common sense facts about the world
it's even going to be missing vocabulary

3204
00:56:04,549 --> 00:56:04,559
it's even going to be missing vocabulary
 

3205
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:05,670
it's even going to be missing vocabulary
and so on

3206
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:05,680
and so on
 

3207
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,390
and so on
yeah it's interesting that uh gbt3 even

3208
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:08,400
yeah it's interesting that uh gbt3 even
 

3209
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,589
yeah it's interesting that uh gbt3 even
doesn't have

3210
00:56:09,589 --> 00:56:09,599
doesn't have
 

3211
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,750
doesn't have
i think any information about the

3212
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:11,760
i think any information about the
 

3213
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,510
i think any information about the
coronavirus

3214
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:13,520
coronavirus
 

3215
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,630
coronavirus
yes which is why you know uh

3216
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:16,640
yes which is why you know uh
 

3217
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,069
yes which is why you know uh
a system that's uh you you tell that the

3218
00:56:20,069 --> 00:56:20,079
a system that's uh you you tell that the
 

3219
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:21,910
a system that's uh you you tell that the
system is intelligent when it's capable

3220
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:21,920
system is intelligent when it's capable
 

3221
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,789
system is intelligent when it's capable
to adapt

3222
00:56:22,789 --> 00:56:22,799
to adapt
 

3223
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:25,750
to adapt
so intelligence is gonna require uh some

3224
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:25,760
so intelligence is gonna require uh some
 

3225
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,910
so intelligence is gonna require uh some
amount of continuous learning

3226
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:27,920
amount of continuous learning
 

3227
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,750
amount of continuous learning
but it's also gonna require some amount

3228
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:29,760
but it's also gonna require some amount
 

3229
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,030
but it's also gonna require some amount
of improvisation like

3230
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:31,040
of improvisation like
 

3231
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,750
of improvisation like
it's not enough to assume that what

3232
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:33,760
it's not enough to assume that what
 

3233
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,030
it's not enough to assume that what
you're going to be

3234
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:35,040
you're going to be
 

3235
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,030
you're going to be
asked to do is something that you've

3236
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:37,040
asked to do is something that you've
 

3237
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,549
asked to do is something that you've
seen before

3238
00:56:38,549 --> 00:56:38,559
seen before
 

3239
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:39,829
seen before
or something that is a simple

3240
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:39,839
or something that is a simple
 

3241
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:41,190
or something that is a simple
interpolation of things you've seen

3242
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:41,200
interpolation of things you've seen
 

3243
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,630
interpolation of things you've seen
before

3244
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:42,640
before
 

3245
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,750
before
yeah in fact that model breaks down for

3246
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:45,760
yeah in fact that model breaks down for
 

3247
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,030
yeah in fact that model breaks down for
uh even even very

3248
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:49,040
uh even even very
 

3249
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,589
uh even even very
tasks that look relatively simple from a

3250
00:56:51,589 --> 00:56:51,599
tasks that look relatively simple from a
 

3251
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:52,230
tasks that look relatively simple from a
distance

3252
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:52,240
distance
 

3253
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,589
distance
like l5 self-driving for instance

3254
00:56:55,589 --> 00:56:55,599
like l5 self-driving for instance
 

3255
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:59,750
like l5 self-driving for instance
google had a paper couple of years back

3256
00:56:59,750 --> 00:56:59,760
google had a paper couple of years back
 

3257
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,750
google had a paper couple of years back
showing that something like 30 million

3258
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:03,760
showing that something like 30 million
 

3259
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,990
showing that something like 30 million
different road situations were actually

3260
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:06,000
different road situations were actually
 

3261
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,069
different road situations were actually
completely insufficient to train

3262
00:57:08,069 --> 00:57:08,079
completely insufficient to train
 

3263
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:11,670
completely insufficient to train
a driving model it wasn't even l2 right

3264
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:11,680
a driving model it wasn't even l2 right
 

3265
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,910
a driving model it wasn't even l2 right
and that's a lot of data that's a lot

3266
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:13,920
and that's a lot of data that's a lot
 

3267
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,109
and that's a lot of data that's a lot
more data than the

3268
00:57:15,109 --> 00:57:15,119
more data than the
 

3269
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,109
more data than the
the 20 or 30 hours of driving that a

3270
00:57:17,109 --> 00:57:17,119
the 20 or 30 hours of driving that a
 

3271
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:18,549
the 20 or 30 hours of driving that a
human needs

3272
00:57:18,549 --> 00:57:18,559
human needs
 

3273
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:20,630
human needs
to learn to drive given the knowledge

3274
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:20,640
to learn to drive given the knowledge
 

3275
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,910
to learn to drive given the knowledge
they've already accumulated

3276
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:21,920
they've already accumulated
 

3277
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,510
they've already accumulated
well let me ask you on that topic

3278
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:25,520
well let me ask you on that topic
 

3279
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:29,510
well let me ask you on that topic
elon musk tesla autopilot

3280
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:29,520
elon musk tesla autopilot
 

3281
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,829
elon musk tesla autopilot
one of the only companies i believe is

3282
00:57:31,829 --> 00:57:31,839
one of the only companies i believe is
 

3283
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:33,750
one of the only companies i believe is
really pushing for a learning based

3284
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:33,760
really pushing for a learning based
 

3285
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,630
really pushing for a learning based
approach

3286
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:34,640
approach
 

3287
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,470
approach
are you you're skeptical that that kind

3288
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:36,480
are you you're skeptical that that kind
 

3289
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,510
are you you're skeptical that that kind
of network can achieve level four

3290
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:39,520
of network can achieve level four
 

3291
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,710
of network can achieve level four
l4 is probably achievable

3292
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:42,720
l4 is probably achievable
 

3293
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,710
l4 is probably achievable
l5 is probably not what's the

3294
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:44,720
l5 is probably not what's the
 

3295
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:45,750
l5 is probably not what's the
distinction there

3296
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:45,760
distinction there
 

3297
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,390
distinction there
this l5 is completely you can just fall

3298
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:48,400
this l5 is completely you can just fall
 

3299
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,270
this l5 is completely you can just fall
asleep

3300
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:49,280

3301
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,510

yeah alpha is basically human level well

3302
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:51,520
yeah alpha is basically human level well
 

3303
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,870
yeah alpha is basically human level well
it will drive you have to be careful

3304
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:52,880
it will drive you have to be careful
 

3305
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,549
it will drive you have to be careful
saying human level because like

3306
00:57:54,549 --> 00:57:54,559
saying human level because like
 

3307
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:57,430
saying human level because like
that's yeah most of the drivers yeah

3308
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:57,440
that's yeah most of the drivers yeah
 

3309
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,829
that's yeah most of the drivers yeah
that's the clearest example of like

3310
00:57:59,829 --> 00:57:59,839
that's the clearest example of like
 

3311
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:02,150
that's the clearest example of like
you know cars will most likely be much

3312
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:02,160
you know cars will most likely be much
 

3313
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,829
you know cars will most likely be much
safer than humans in situ

3314
00:58:03,829 --> 00:58:03,839
safer than humans in situ
 

3315
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:06,549
safer than humans in situ
in many situations where humans fail

3316
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:06,559
in many situations where humans fail
 

3317
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:07,030
in many situations where humans fail
it's the

3318
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:07,040
it's the
 

3319
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:11,510
it's the
vice versa so i'll tell you you know

3320
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:11,520
vice versa so i'll tell you you know
 

3321
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,510
vice versa so i'll tell you you know
the thing is the the amounts of training

3322
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:13,520
the thing is the the amounts of training
 

3323
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,630
the thing is the the amounts of training
data you would need

3324
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:14,640
data you would need
 

3325
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,470
data you would need
to anticipate for pretty much every

possible situation
 

3329
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,630
possible situation
you'll encounter in the real world uh is

00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:20,640
you'll encounter in the real world uh is
 

3331
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,349
you'll encounter in the real world uh is
such that

3332

such that
 

3333
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:24,069
such that
it's not entirely unrealistic to think

00:58:24,069 --> 00:58:24,079
it's not entirely unrealistic to think
 

3335
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:25,589
it's not entirely unrealistic to think
that at some point in the future we'll

00:58:25,589 --> 00:58:25,599
that at some point in the future we'll
 

3337
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:26,870
that at some point in the future we'll
develop a system that's running on

00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:26,880
develop a system that's running on
 

3339
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,030
develop a system that's running on
enough data especially uh

00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:29,040
enough data especially uh
 

3341
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,349
enough data especially uh
provided that we can uh simulate a lot

3342
00:58:31,349 --> 00:58:31,359
provided that we can uh simulate a lot
 

3343
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:32,230
provided that we can uh simulate a lot
of that data

3344
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:32,240
of that data
 

3345
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,910
of that data
we don't necessarily need actual uh

3346
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:33,920
we don't necessarily need actual uh
 

3347
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,589
we don't necessarily need actual uh
actual cars on the road

3348
00:58:35,589 --> 00:58:35,599
actual cars on the road
 

3349
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:38,789
actual cars on the road
for everything but it's a massive

3350
00:58:38,789 --> 00:58:38,799
for everything but it's a massive
 

3351
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:41,270
for everything but it's a massive
effort and it turns out you can create a

3352
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:41,280
effort and it turns out you can create a
 

3353
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,069
effort and it turns out you can create a
system that's

3354
00:58:42,069 --> 00:58:42,079
system that's
 

3355
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:44,549
system that's
much more adaptative that can generalize

3356
00:58:44,549 --> 00:58:44,559
much more adaptative that can generalize
 

3357
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:45,190
much more adaptative that can generalize
much better

00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:45,200
much better
 

3359
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,829
much better
if you just add

01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:22,230
because we get to look at the problem
like it's not like you get to close

01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:22,240
like it's not like you get to close

like it's not like you get to close
our eyes and completely new to driving

3446
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:24,640
our eyes and completely new to driving
 

3447
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,069
our eyes and completely new to driving
we get to do what we do as

3448
01:00:26,069 --> 01:00:26,079
we get to do what we do as
 

3449
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:28,230
we get to do what we do as
human beings which is uh for the

01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:28,240
human beings which is uh for the
 

3451
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,150
human beings which is uh for the

before we ever learn quote unquote to
 

3455
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,670
before we ever learn quote unquote to
drive we get to watch other

3456
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:33,680
drive we get to watch other
 

3457
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,910
drive we get to watch other
cars and other people drive we get to be

3458
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:35,920
cars and other people drive we get to be
 

3459
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,109
cars and other people drive we get to be
in cars we get to

3460
01:00:37,109 --> 01:00:37,119
in cars we get to
 

3461
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:39,030
in cars we get to
watch we get to get to see movies about

you know get to observe all this stuff

3466
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:42,640
you know get to observe all this stuff
 

3467
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,910
you know get to observe all this stuff
and that's similar to what neural

3468
01:00:43,910 --> 01:00:43,920
and that's similar to what neural
 

3469
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:44,950
and that's similar to what neural
networks are doing

3470
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:44,960

3471
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,710

it's getting a lot of data and

3472
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:48,720
it's getting a lot of data and
 

3473
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,910
it's getting a lot of data and
the the the question is yeah how much is

3474
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:51,920
the the the question is yeah how much is
 

3475
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:52,950
the the the question is yeah how much is
uh

3476
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:52,960
uh
 

3477
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,750
uh
how many leaps of reasoning genius is

3478
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:55,760
how many leaps of reasoning genius is
 

3479
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,510
how many leaps of reasoning genius is
required

3480
01:00:57,510 --> 01:00:57,520

3481
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,270

to be able to actually effectively drive

3482
01:00:59,270 --> 01:00:59,280
to be able to actually effectively drive
 

3483
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,190
to be able to actually effectively drive
i think it's an example of driving

3484
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:01,200
i think it's an example of driving
 

3485
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:05,510
i think it's an example of driving
i mean sure you've seen a lot of cars

3486
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:05,520
i mean sure you've seen a lot of cars
 

3487
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,589
i mean sure you've seen a lot of cars
in your life before you learn to drive

3488
01:01:07,589 --> 01:01:07,599
in your life before you learn to drive
 

3489
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:09,589
in your life before you learn to drive
but let's say you've learned to drive in

01:01:09,589 --> 01:01:09,599
but let's say you've learned to drive in
 

3491
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:09,990
but let's say you've learned to drive in
silicon

3492

3495
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,589

well now everyone is driving on the

3496
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:15,599
well now everyone is driving on the
 

3497
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:17,750
well now everyone is driving on the
other side of the road and the signs are

3498
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:17,760
other side of the road and the signs are
 

3499
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,470
other side of the road and the signs are
different

3500
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:18,480
different
 

3501
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,309
different
and the roads are more narrow and so on

3502
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:20,319
and the roads are more narrow and so on
 

3503
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:21,589
and the roads are more narrow and so on
so it's a very very different

3504
01:01:21,589 --> 01:01:21,599
so it's a very very different
 

3505
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:23,190
so it's a very very different

01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,430
uh a smart human even an average human
should be able to just zero shot it to

like learning to drive in the u.s right

3532
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:55,200
like learning to drive in the u.s right
 

3533
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:55,990
like learning to drive in the u.s right
i would say

3534
01:01:55,990 --> 01:01:56,000
i would say
 

3535
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,910
i would say
the reason i ask this one of the most

3536
01:01:57,910 --> 01:01:57,920
the reason i ask this one of the most
 

3537
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,990
the reason i ask this one of the most
interesting tests of intelligence we

3538
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:00,000
interesting tests of intelligence we
 

3539
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,309
interesting tests of intelligence we
have

3540
01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:00,319
have
 

3541
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:04,390
have
today actively which is driving

3542
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:04,400
today actively which is driving
 

3543
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,829
today actively which is driving
in terms of having an impact on the

3544
01:02:05,829 --> 01:02:05,839
in terms of having an impact on the
 

3545
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:07,990
in terms of having an impact on the
world like when do you think we'll pass

3546
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:08,000
world like when do you think we'll pass
 

3547
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,750
world like when do you think we'll pass
that test of intelligence

3548
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:09,760
that test of intelligence
 

3549
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,150
that test of intelligence
so i i don't think driving is that much

3550
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:12,160
so i i don't think driving is that much
 

3551
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,789
so i i don't think driving is that much

there is no task for which skid at that

3554
01:02:17,829 --> 01:02:17,839
there is no task for which skid at that
 

3555
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:18,390
there is no task for which skid at that

3559
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:23,829

it's a kind of meta task that involves

01:02:23,829 --> 01:02:23,839
it's a kind of meta task that involves
 

3561
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:25,349
it's a kind of meta task that involves
acquiring

01:02:25,349 --> 01:02:25,359
acquiring
 

3563
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:27,670
acquiring
new skills so i don't think i think you

3564
01:02:27,670 --> 01:02:27,680
new skills so i don't think i think you
 

3565
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,270
new skills so i don't think i think you
can actually solve driving

3566
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:29,280
can actually solve driving
 

3567
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,190
can actually solve driving

01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:51,990
with the whole idea is um
collecting a data sets that's

collecting a data sets that's

the very long tail of possible

the very long tail of possible

01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:57,200
situations you might encounter
 

3595
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,349
situations you might encounter
and it's really just a scale problem so

3596
01:02:59,349 --> 01:02:59,359
and it's really just a scale problem so
 

3597
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:00,549
and it's really just a scale problem so
i think the

3598
01:03:00,549 --> 01:03:00,559
i think the
 

3599
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:03,670
i think the
there's nothing fundamentally wrong

3600
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:03,680
there's nothing fundamentally wrong
 

3601
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:06,630
there's nothing fundamentally wrong
uh uh with this plan with this idea it's

3602
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:06,640
uh uh with this plan with this idea it's
 

3603
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:07,829
uh uh with this plan with this idea it's
just that

3604
01:03:07,829 --> 01:03:07,839
just that
 

3605
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:10,950

of most possible situations that can

3770
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:06,160
of most possible situations that can
 

3771
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:07,029
of most possible situations that can
that can occur

3772
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:07,039
that can occur
 

3773
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:09,270
that can occur
in the practice of that skill then the

3774
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:09,280
in the practice of that skill then the
 

3775
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,190
in the practice of that skill then the
system is not intelligent it is mostly

3776
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:11,200
system is not intelligent it is mostly
 

3777
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,710
system is not intelligent it is mostly
just

3778
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:12,720
just
 

3779
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:16,069
just
a lookup table yeah

3780
01:06:16,069 --> 01:06:16,079
a lookup table yeah
 

3781
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:19,589
a lookup table yeah
well likewise if uh in order to acquire

3782
01:06:19,589 --> 01:06:19,599
well likewise if uh in order to acquire
 

3783
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:20,630
well likewise if uh in order to acquire
a skill you need

3784
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:20,640
a skill you need
 

3785
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,589
a skill you need
a human engineer to write down a bunch

3786
01:06:23,589 --> 01:06:23,599
a human engineer to write down a bunch
 

3787
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:24,950
a human engineer to write down a bunch
of rules that cover

3788
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:24,960
of rules that cover
 

3789
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,870
of rules that cover
most or every possible situation

3790
01:06:26,870 --> 01:06:26,880
most or every possible situation
 

3791
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,710
most or every possible situation
likewise the system is

3792
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:28,720
likewise the system is
 

3793
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,710
likewise the system is
is not intelligent the system is merely

3794
01:06:30,710 --> 01:06:30,720
is not intelligent the system is merely
 

3795
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,029
is not intelligent the system is merely
the output artifact

3796
01:06:33,029 --> 01:06:33,039
the output artifact
 

3797
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:35,750
the output artifact
of a process that that depends that

3798
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:35,760
of a process that that depends that
 

3799
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,829
of a process that that depends that
happens in the minds

3800
01:06:37,829 --> 01:06:37,839
happens in the minds
 

3801
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:39,910
happens in the minds
of the engineers that are creating it

3802
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:39,920
of the engineers that are creating it
 

3803
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,270
of the engineers that are creating it
right it is

3804
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:41,280
right it is
 

3805
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,630
right it is
including uh an abstraction that's

3806
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:44,640
including uh an abstraction that's
 

3807
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,390
including uh an abstraction that's
produced by the human mind

3808
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:46,400
produced by the human mind
 

3809
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:51,349
produced by the human mind
and intelligence that would actually be

3810
01:06:51,349 --> 01:06:51,359

 

3811
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:54,230

the process of producing of autonomously

3812
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:54,240
the process of producing of autonomously
 

3813
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,230
the process of producing of autonomously
producing this abstraction

3814
01:06:56,230 --> 01:06:56,240
producing this abstraction
 

3815
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:59,190
producing this abstraction
yeah not like if you take an abstraction

3816
01:06:59,190 --> 01:06:59,200
yeah not like if you take an abstraction
 

3817
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,230
yeah not like if you take an abstraction
you encode it

3818
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:00,240
you encode it
 

3819
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,150
you encode it
on a piece of paper or in a computer

3820
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:02,160
on a piece of paper or in a computer
 

3821
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,470
on a piece of paper or in a computer
program the abstraction itself

3822
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:04,480
program the abstraction itself
 

3823
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:08,069
program the abstraction itself
is not intelligent what's intelligent is

3824
01:07:08,069 --> 01:07:08,079
is not intelligent what's intelligent is
 

3825
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:09,750
is not intelligent what's intelligent is
the the agent that's capable of

3826
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:09,760
the the agent that's capable of
 

3827
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,109
the the agent that's capable of
producing these abstractions

3828
01:07:11,109 --> 01:07:11,119
producing these abstractions
 

3829
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:13,029
producing these abstractions
right yeah it feels like there's a

3830
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:13,039
right yeah it feels like there's a
 

3831
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:15,190
right yeah it feels like there's a
little bit of a gray area

3832
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:15,200
little bit of a gray area
 

3833
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,589
little bit of a gray area
like because you're basically saying

3834
01:07:17,589 --> 01:07:17,599
like because you're basically saying
 

3835
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:19,910
like because you're basically saying
that deep learning forms abstractions

3836
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:19,920
that deep learning forms abstractions
 

3837
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:23,750
that deep learning forms abstractions
too but those abstractions

3838
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:23,760
too but those abstractions
 

3839
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,549
too but those abstractions
do not seem to be effective for

3840
01:07:26,549 --> 01:07:26,559
do not seem to be effective for
 

3841
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:27,990
do not seem to be effective for
generalizing far outside

3842
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:28,000
generalizing far outside
 

3843
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,230
generalizing far outside
of the things that's already seen but

3844
01:07:30,230 --> 01:07:30,240
of the things that's already seen but
 

3845
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,670
of the things that's already seen but
generalize a little bit

3846
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:31,680
generalize a little bit
 

3847
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,349
generalize a little bit
yeah absolutely no depending does

3848
01:07:33,349 --> 01:07:33,359
yeah absolutely no depending does
 

3849
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:34,710
yeah absolutely no depending does
generalize a little bit like

3850
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:34,720
generalize a little bit like
 

3851
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,950
generalize a little bit like
generalization is not it's not a binary

3852
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:36,960
generalization is not it's not a binary
 

3853
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,150
generalization is not it's not a binary
it's mark a spectrum

3854
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:38,160
it's mark a spectrum
 

3855
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,230
it's mark a spectrum
yeah and there's a certain point it's a

3856
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:40,240
yeah and there's a certain point it's a
 

3857
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,230
yeah and there's a certain point it's a
gray area but there's a certain point

3858
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:42,240
gray area but there's a certain point
 

3859
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,150
gray area but there's a certain point
where there's an impressive degree of

3860
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:44,160
where there's an impressive degree of
 

3861
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,349
where there's an impressive degree of
generalization

3862
01:07:45,349 --> 01:07:45,359
generalization
 

3863
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:48,549
generalization
that happens no like

3864
01:07:48,549 --> 01:07:48,559
that happens no like
 

3865
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:51,589
that happens no like
i guess exactly what you were saying is

3866
01:07:51,589 --> 01:07:51,599
i guess exactly what you were saying is
 

3867
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:55,270
i guess exactly what you were saying is
uh intelligence is um

3868
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:55,280
uh intelligence is um
 

3869
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,109
uh intelligence is um
how efficiently you're able to

3870
01:07:57,109 --> 01:07:57,119
how efficiently you're able to
 

3871
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:59,750
how efficiently you're able to
generalize

3872
01:07:59,750 --> 01:07:59,760
generalize
 

3873
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,910
generalize
far outside of the distribution of

3874
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:01,920
far outside of the distribution of
 

3875
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,270
far outside of the distribution of
things you've seen already

3876
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:03,280
things you've seen already
 

3877
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,510
things you've seen already
yes so it's both like the the distance

3878
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:05,520
yes so it's both like the the distance
 

3879
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:06,789
yes so it's both like the the distance
of how far you can

3880
01:08:06,789 --> 01:08:06,799
of how far you can
 

3881
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:09,589
of how far you can
like how new how radically new something

3882
01:08:09,589 --> 01:08:09,599
like how new how radically new something
 

3883
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,069
like how new how radically new something
is

3884
01:08:10,069 --> 01:08:10,079
is
 

3885
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:12,870
is
and how efficiently yes absolutely so

3886
01:08:12,870 --> 01:08:12,880
and how efficiently yes absolutely so
 

3887
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:13,910
and how efficiently yes absolutely so
you you can think of

3888
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:13,920
you you can think of
 

3889
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,630
you you can think of
uh intelligence as a measure of an

3890
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:16,640
uh intelligence as a measure of an
 

3891
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,789
uh intelligence as a measure of an
information conversion ratio

3892
01:08:18,789 --> 01:08:18,799
information conversion ratio
 

3893
01:08:18,799 --> 01:08:21,590
information conversion ratio
like imagine uh a space of possible

3894
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:21,600
like imagine uh a space of possible
 

3895
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,430
like imagine uh a space of possible
situations

3896
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:23,440
situations
 

3897
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:27,669
situations
and you've covered some of them

3898
01:08:27,669 --> 01:08:27,679
and you've covered some of them
 

3899
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:30,149
and you've covered some of them
so you have some amount of information

3900
01:08:30,149 --> 01:08:30,159
so you have some amount of information
 

3901
01:08:30,159 --> 01:08:31,910
so you have some amount of information
about your space of possible situations

3902
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:31,920
about your space of possible situations
 

3903
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,349
about your space of possible situations
that's provided by the situations you

3904
01:08:33,349 --> 01:08:33,359
that's provided by the situations you
 

3905
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,390
that's provided by the situations you
already know

3906
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:34,400
already know
 

3907
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:35,990
already know
and that's on the other hand also

3908
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:36,000
and that's on the other hand also
 

3909
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,590
and that's on the other hand also
provided by

3910
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:37,600
provided by
 

3911
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,510
provided by
the prior knowledge that the system

3912
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:39,520
the prior knowledge that the system
 

3913
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,510
the prior knowledge that the system
brings to the table the prior knowledge

3914
01:08:41,510 --> 01:08:41,520
brings to the table the prior knowledge
 

3915
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:42,309
brings to the table the prior knowledge
that's embedded

3916
01:08:42,309 --> 01:08:42,319
that's embedded
 

3917
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:44,870
that's embedded
in the system so the system starts with

3918
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:44,880
in the system so the system starts with
 

3919
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:45,910
in the system so the system starts with
some information

3920
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:45,920
some information
 

3921
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:49,829
some information
right about the problem but the task and

3922
01:08:49,829 --> 01:08:49,839
right about the problem but the task and
 

3923
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:52,470
right about the problem but the task and
it's about going from that information

3924
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:52,480
it's about going from that information
 

3925
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:52,950
it's about going from that information
to

3926
01:08:52,950 --> 01:08:52,960
to
 

3927
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,870
to
a program what you would call a skill

3928
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:54,880
a program what you would call a skill
 

3929
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,390
a program what you would call a skill
program a behavioral program

3930
01:08:56,390 --> 01:08:56,400
program a behavioral program
 

3931
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,349
program a behavioral program
that can cover a large area of possible

3932
01:08:59,349 --> 01:08:59,359
that can cover a large area of possible

situation space
 

3935
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:03,510
situation space
and essentially the ratio between that

01:09:03,510 --> 01:09:03,520
and essentially the ratio between that
 

3937
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,269
and essentially the ratio between that
area and the amount of information you

3938
01:09:05,269 --> 01:09:05,279
area and the amount of information you
 

3939
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:06,550
area and the amount of information you
start with

3940
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:06,560
start with
 

3941
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,669
start with
is intelligence

3942
01:09:09,669 --> 01:09:09,679

 

3943
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:13,110

so a very smart agent uh can make

3944
01:09:13,110 --> 01:09:13,120
so a very smart agent uh can make
 

3945
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:14,149
so a very smart agent uh can make
efficient uses

3946
01:09:14,149 --> 01:09:14,159
efficient uses
 

3947
01:09:14,159 --> 01:09:17,110
efficient uses
of very little information about a new

01:09:17,110 --> 01:09:17,120
of very little information about a new
 

3949
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,709
of very little information about a new
problem and very little prior knowledge

so one of the other big things you talk

3962
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:32,560
so one of the other big things you talk
 

3963
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,390
so one of the other big things you talk
about in in the paper

3964
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:34,400
about in in the paper
 

3965
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,229
about in in the paper
we've talked about a little bit already

3966
01:09:36,229 --> 01:09:36,239
we've talked about a little bit already
 

3967
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:38,309
we've talked about a little bit already
but let's talk about it some more is uh

3968
01:09:38,309 --> 01:09:38,319
but let's talk about it some more is uh
 

3969
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:42,470
but let's talk about it some more is uh
actual tests of intelligence so

3970
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:42,480
actual tests of intelligence so
 

3971
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:45,030
actual tests of intelligence so
if we look at like human and machine

3972
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:45,040
if we look at like human and machine
 

3973
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:45,829
if we look at like human and machine
intelligence

3974
01:09:45,829 --> 01:09:45,839
intelligence
 

3975
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:47,990
intelligence
do you think tests of intelligence

3976
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:48,000
do you think tests of intelligence
 

3977
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,030
do you think tests of intelligence
should be different

3978
01:09:49,030 --> 01:09:49,040
should be different
 

3979
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:50,870
should be different
for humans and machines or how we think

3980
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:50,880
for humans and machines or how we think
 

3981
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:54,390
for humans and machines or how we think
about testing of intelligence

3982
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:54,400
about testing of intelligence
 

3983
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:58,709
about testing of intelligence
are these fundamentally the same kind of

3984
01:09:58,709 --> 01:09:58,719

 

3985
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:00,550

intelligences that we're after and

3986
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:00,560
intelligences that we're after and
 

3987
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,149
intelligences that we're after and
therefore the test should be

3988
01:10:02,149 --> 01:10:02,159
therefore the test should be
 

3989
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:06,950
therefore the test should be
similar so if your goal is to create

3990
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:06,960
similar so if your goal is to create
 

3991
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:10,390
similar so if your goal is to create
ais that are more human-like

3992
01:10:10,390 --> 01:10:10,400
ais that are more human-like
 

3993
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,390
ais that are more human-like
then it will be super variable obviously

3994
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:12,400
then it will be super variable obviously
 

3995
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,149
then it will be super variable obviously
to have a test

3996
01:10:14,149 --> 01:10:14,159
to have a test
 

3997
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:16,310
to have a test
that's that's universal at a price to

3998
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:16,320
that's that's universal at a price to
 

3999
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:18,149
that's that's universal at a price to
both uh ais

4000
01:10:18,149 --> 01:10:18,159
both uh ais
 

4001
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:20,229
both uh ais
uh and humans so that you can you could

4002
01:10:20,229 --> 01:10:20,239
uh and humans so that you can you could
 

4003
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:21,990
uh and humans so that you can you could
establish a comparison

4004
01:10:21,990 --> 01:10:22,000
establish a comparison
 

4005
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,229
establish a comparison
uh between the two that you could tell

4006
01:10:24,229 --> 01:10:24,239
uh between the two that you could tell
 

4007
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:25,189
uh between the two that you could tell
exactly

4008
01:10:25,189 --> 01:10:25,199
exactly
 

4009
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:28,149
exactly
how uh intelligent in terms of human

4010
01:10:28,149 --> 01:10:28,159
how uh intelligent in terms of human
 

4011
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:29,350
how uh intelligent in terms of human
intelligence

4012
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:29,360
intelligence
 

4013
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:32,229
intelligence
a given system is so that said the

4014
01:10:32,229 --> 01:10:32,239
a given system is so that said the
 

4015
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:33,910
a given system is so that said the
constraints

4016
01:10:33,910 --> 01:10:33,920
constraints
 

4017
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,310
constraints
that apply to artificial intelligence

4018
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:36,320
that apply to artificial intelligence
 

4019
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,590
that apply to artificial intelligence
and to human intelligence

4020
01:10:37,590 --> 01:10:37,600
and to human intelligence
 

4021
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:41,270
and to human intelligence
are very different and your tests should

4022
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:41,280
are very different and your tests should
 

4023
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:44,790
are very different and your tests should
account for this difference

4024
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:44,800
account for this difference
 

4025
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,470
account for this difference
because if you look at artificial

4026
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:46,480
because if you look at artificial
 

4027
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:49,189
because if you look at artificial
systems it's always possible

4028
01:10:49,189 --> 01:10:49,199
systems it's always possible
 

4029
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:52,630
systems it's always possible
for an experimenter to buy arbitrary

for an experimenter to buy arbitrary
 

4031
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:53,990
for an experimenter to buy arbitrary
levels of skill

4032
01:10:53,990 --> 01:10:54,000
levels of skill
 

4033
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,430
levels of skill
at arbitrary tasks either by

01:10:57,430 --> 01:10:57,440
at arbitrary tasks either by
 

4035
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:01,110
at arbitrary tasks either by
injecting a hard-coded prior knowledge

4036
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:01,120
injecting a hard-coded prior knowledge
 

4037
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:04,550
injecting a hard-coded prior knowledge
into the system via rules

4038
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:04,560
into the system via rules
 

4039
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,790
into the system via rules
and so on that come from the human mind

4040
01:11:06,790 --> 01:11:06,800
and so on that come from the human mind
 

4041
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,630
and so on that come from the human mind
from the minds of the programmers

4042
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:08,640
from the minds of the programmers
 

4043
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:12,550
from the minds of the programmers
and also buying uh higher levels of

4044
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:12,560
and also buying uh higher levels of
 

4045
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,510
and also buying uh higher levels of
skill just by training on more data

4046
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:15,520
skill just by training on more data
 

4047
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,270
skill just by training on more data
for instance you could generate an

4048
01:11:17,270 --> 01:11:17,280
for instance you could generate an
 

4049
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:19,430
for instance you could generate an
infinity of different goal games

4050
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:19,440
infinity of different goal games
 

4051
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,669
infinity of different goal games
and you could train a good playing

4052
01:11:21,669 --> 01:11:21,679
and you could train a good playing
 

4053
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:22,950
and you could train a good playing
system

4055
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,510

that way but you could not directly

01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:25,520
that way but you could not directly
 

4057
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:26,070
that way but you could not directly
compare

01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:26,080
compare
 

4059
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:29,189
compare
it to human goal playing skills because

4060
01:11:29,189 --> 01:11:29,199
it to human goal playing skills because
 

4061
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:31,590
it to human goal playing skills because
a human that plays go had to develop

4062
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:31,600
a human that plays go had to develop
 

4063
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:32,709
a human that plays go had to develop
that skill

4064
01:11:32,709 --> 01:11:32,719
that skill
 

4065
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:34,709
that skill
in a very constrained environment they

4066
01:11:34,709 --> 01:11:34,719
in a very constrained environment they
 

4067
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:36,470
in a very constrained environment they
had a limited amount of time

4068
01:11:36,470 --> 01:11:36,480
had a limited amount of time
 

4069
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:39,189
had a limited amount of time
their limited amount of energy and of

4070
01:11:39,189 --> 01:11:39,199
their limited amount of energy and of
 

4071
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:40,310
their limited amount of energy and of
course

4072
01:11:40,310 --> 01:11:40,320
course
 

4073
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,070
course
this started from a different set of

4074
01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:42,080
this started from a different set of
 

4075
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,910
this started from a different set of
priors to solids from

4076
01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:43,920
priors to solids from
 

4077
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:47,990
priors to solids from
uh um you know innate uh human priors

4078
01:11:47,990 --> 01:11:48,000
uh um you know innate uh human priors
 

4079
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,910
uh um you know innate uh human priors
um so i think if you want to compare the

4080
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:49,920
um so i think if you want to compare the
 

4081
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,669
um so i think if you want to compare the
intelligence of two systems like the

4082
01:11:51,669 --> 01:11:51,679
intelligence of two systems like the
 

4083
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:53,270
intelligence of two systems like the
intentions of an ai

4084
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:53,280
intentions of an ai
 

4085
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,709
intentions of an ai
and the intelligence of a human you have

4086
01:11:56,709 --> 01:11:56,719
and the intelligence of a human you have
 

4087
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:57,669
and the intelligence of a human you have
to

4088
01:11:57,669 --> 01:11:57,679
to
 

4089
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:01,270
to
um control for priors you have to

4090
01:12:01,270 --> 01:12:01,280
um control for priors you have to
 

4091
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,910
um control for priors you have to
start from the the same set of knowledge

4092
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:03,920
start from the the same set of knowledge
 

4093
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,830
start from the the same set of knowledge
priors about the task

4094
01:12:05,830 --> 01:12:05,840
priors about the task
 

4095
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,430
priors about the task
and you have to control for for

4096
01:12:07,430 --> 01:12:07,440
and you have to control for for
 

4097
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,510
and you have to control for for
experience and that is to say for

4098
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:09,520
experience and that is to say for
 

4099
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,110
experience and that is to say for
training data

4100
01:12:11,110 --> 01:12:11,120
training data
 

4101
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:14,950
training data
so prior what's priors

4102
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:14,960
so prior what's priors
 

4103
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:18,070
so prior what's priors
so prior is whatever information

4104
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:18,080
so prior is whatever information
 

4105
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:21,030
so prior is whatever information
you have about a given task before you

4106
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:21,040
you have about a given task before you
 

4107
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,110
you have about a given task before you
start learning about this task

4108
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:23,120
start learning about this task
 

4109
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:25,669
start learning about this task
and how's the difference from experience

4110
01:12:25,669 --> 01:12:25,679
and how's the difference from experience
 

4111
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:27,590
and how's the difference from experience
well experience is acquired

4112
01:12:27,590 --> 01:12:27,600
well experience is acquired
 

4113
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,030
well experience is acquired
right so for instance if you're if

4114
01:12:29,030 --> 01:12:29,040
right so for instance if you're if
 

4115
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,030
right so for instance if you're if
you're trying to play goal

4116
01:12:31,030 --> 01:12:31,040
you're trying to play goal
 

4117
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:33,189
you're trying to play goal
your experience with goal is all the

4118
01:12:33,189 --> 01:12:33,199
your experience with goal is all the
 

4119
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:34,630
your experience with goal is all the
goal games you've played

4120
01:12:34,630 --> 01:12:34,640
goal games you've played
 

4121
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:37,110
goal games you've played
or you've seen or you've simulated in

4122
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:37,120
or you've seen or you've simulated in
 

4123
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,550
or you've seen or you've simulated in
your mind let's say

4124
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:38,560
your mind let's say
 

4125
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:41,990
your mind let's say
and uh your priors are things like

4126
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:42,000
and uh your priors are things like
 

4127
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,830
and uh your priors are things like
well go go is a game on on a 2d grid

4128
01:12:45,830 --> 01:12:45,840
well go go is a game on on a 2d grid
 

4129
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,790
well go go is a game on on a 2d grid
and we have lots of hard-coded priors

4130
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:48,800
and we have lots of hard-coded priors
 

4131
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,790
and we have lots of hard-coded priors
about

4132
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:50,800
about
 

4133
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,910
about
the organization of 2d space and the

4134
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:53,920
the organization of 2d space and the
 

4135
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:56,229
the organization of 2d space and the
rules of how

4136
01:12:56,229 --> 01:12:56,239
rules of how
 

4137
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:58,550
rules of how
the the dynamics of the physics of this

4138
01:12:58,550 --> 01:12:58,560
the the dynamics of the physics of this
 

4139
01:12:58,560 --> 01:12:59,990
the the dynamics of the physics of this
game in this 2d space

4140
01:12:59,990 --> 01:13:00,000
game in this 2d space
 

4141
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,870
game in this 2d space
yes and the idea that you have what

4142
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:02,880
yes and the idea that you have what
 

4143
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,229
yes and the idea that you have what
winning is

4144
01:13:04,229 --> 01:13:04,239
winning is
 

4145
01:13:04,239 --> 01:13:06,950
winning is
yes exactly so like and all other board

4146
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:06,960
yes exactly so like and all other board
 

4147
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:07,430
yes exactly so like and all other board
games

4148
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:07,440
games
 

4149
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,270
games
can also share some similarities with

4150
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:09,280
can also share some similarities with
 

4151
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,709
can also share some similarities with
school and if you've played these board

4152
01:13:10,709 --> 01:13:10,719
school and if you've played these board
 

4153
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:11,669
school and if you've played these board
games then

4154
01:13:11,669 --> 01:13:11,679
games then
 

4155
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,750
games then
uh with respect to the game of go that

4156
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:13,760
uh with respect to the game of go that
 

4157
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,430
uh with respect to the game of go that
would be part of your priors about the

4158
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:15,440
would be part of your priors about the
 

4159
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,149
would be part of your priors about the
game

4160
01:13:16,149 --> 01:13:16,159
game
 

4161
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:17,669
game
well it's interesting to think about the

4162
01:13:17,669 --> 01:13:17,679
well it's interesting to think about the
 

4163
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:19,590
well it's interesting to think about the
game of goes how many priors are

4164
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:19,600
game of goes how many priors are
 

4165
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,550
game of goes how many priors are
actually brought to the table

4166
01:13:22,550 --> 01:13:22,560
actually brought to the table
 

4167
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,910
actually brought to the table
when you look at uh self-play

4168
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:25,920
when you look at uh self-play
 

4169
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,070
when you look at uh self-play
reinforcement learning based mechanisms

4170
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:28,080
reinforcement learning based mechanisms
 

4171
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:29,430
reinforcement learning based mechanisms
that do learning it seems like the

4172
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:29,440
that do learning it seems like the
 

4173
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:31,430
that do learning it seems like the
number of prizes pretty low yes but

4174
01:13:31,430 --> 01:13:31,440
number of prizes pretty low yes but
 

4175
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:32,630
number of prizes pretty low yes but
you're saying you should be exp

4176
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:32,640
you're saying you should be exp
 

4177
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,709
you're saying you should be exp
there's a 2d special priority in the

4178
01:13:34,709 --> 01:13:34,719
there's a 2d special priority in the
 

4179
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,669
there's a 2d special priority in the
covenant

4180
01:13:35,669 --> 01:13:35,679
covenant
 

4181
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:38,870
covenant
right but you should be clear at making

4182
01:13:38,870 --> 01:13:38,880
right but you should be clear at making
 

4183
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,470
right but you should be clear at making
those priors explicit

4184
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:40,480
those priors explicit
 

4185
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:43,110
those priors explicit
yes uh so in particular i think if your

4186
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:43,120
yes uh so in particular i think if your
 

4187
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:44,070
yes uh so in particular i think if your
if your goal

4188
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:44,080
if your goal
 

4189
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,470
if your goal
is to measure a human-like form of

4190
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:46,480
is to measure a human-like form of
 

4191
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:47,669
is to measure a human-like form of
intelligence

4192
01:13:47,669 --> 01:13:47,679
intelligence
 

4193
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:49,830
intelligence
then you should clearly establish that

4194
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:49,840
then you should clearly establish that
 

4195
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,189
then you should clearly establish that
you want

4196
01:13:51,189 --> 01:13:51,199
you want
 

4197
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:54,550
you want
the ai your testing to start from

4198
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:54,560
the ai your testing to start from
 

4199
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,870
the ai your testing to start from
the same set of priors that humans start

4200
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:56,880
the same set of priors that humans start
 

4201
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,790
the same set of priors that humans start
with right

4202
01:13:58,790 --> 01:13:58,800
with right
 

4203
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,669
with right
so i mean to me personally but i think

4204
01:14:01,669 --> 01:14:01,679
so i mean to me personally but i think
 

4205
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:02,630
so i mean to me personally but i think
to a lot of people

4206
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:02,640
to a lot of people
 

4207
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,070
to a lot of people
the human side of things is very

4208
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:04,080
the human side of things is very
 

4209
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,550
the human side of things is very
interesting so testing intelligence for

4210
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:06,560
interesting so testing intelligence for
 

4211
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:08,070
interesting so testing intelligence for
humans

4212
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:08,080
humans
 

4213
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:11,270
humans
what um what do you think is a good test

4214
01:14:11,270 --> 01:14:11,280
what um what do you think is a good test
 

4215
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,390
what um what do you think is a good test
of human intelligence

4216
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:14,400
of human intelligence
 

4217
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,470
of human intelligence
well that's the question that

4218
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:16,480
well that's the question that
 

4219
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:17,750
well that's the question that
psychometrics

4220
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:17,760
psychometrics
 

4221
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,990
psychometrics
is is interested in what is there's an

4222
01:14:19,990 --> 01:14:20,000
is is interested in what is there's an
 

4223
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,310
is is interested in what is there's an
entire subfield of psychology

4224
01:14:22,310 --> 01:14:22,320
entire subfield of psychology
 

4225
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:24,070
entire subfield of psychology
that deals with this question so what's

4226
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:24,080
that deals with this question so what's
 

4227
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:26,070
that deals with this question so what's
psychometrics the psychometrics

4228
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:26,080
psychometrics the psychometrics
 

4229
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:28,470
psychometrics the psychometrics
is the sub-field of psychology that that

4230
01:14:28,470 --> 01:14:28,480
is the sub-field of psychology that that
 

4231
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,630
is the sub-field of psychology that that
tries to

4232
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:30,640
tries to
 

4233
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,510
tries to
measure quantify aspects of the human

4234
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:33,520
measure quantify aspects of the human
 

4235
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,110
measure quantify aspects of the human
mind so in particular community

4236
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:35,120
mind so in particular community
 

4237
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,950
mind so in particular community
abilities intelligence

4238
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:36,960
abilities intelligence
 

4239
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,070
abilities intelligence
and personality threats as well so

4240
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:40,080
and personality threats as well so
 

4241
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:43,189
and personality threats as well so
uh like what are might be a weird

4242
01:14:43,189 --> 01:14:43,199
uh like what are might be a weird
 

4243
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:44,630
uh like what are might be a weird
question but what are like the first

4244
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:44,640
question but what are like the first
 

4245
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:45,990
question but what are like the first
principles

4246
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:46,000
principles
 

4247
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,550
principles
of the of psychometrics that

4248
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:50,560
of the of psychometrics that
 

4249
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:53,030
of the of psychometrics that
operates on the you know what what are

4250
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:53,040
operates on the you know what what are
 

4251
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:55,350
operates on the you know what what are
the priors it brings to the table

4252
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:55,360
the priors it brings to the table
 

4253
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,750
the priors it brings to the table
so it's a filled with a with a fairly

4254
01:14:57,750 --> 01:14:57,760
so it's a filled with a with a fairly
 

4255
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,030
so it's a filled with a with a fairly
long history

4256
01:14:59,030 --> 01:14:59,040
long history
 

4257
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:03,430
long history
um it's so you know psychology sometimes

4258
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:03,440
um it's so you know psychology sometimes
 

4259
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,590
um it's so you know psychology sometimes
gets a bad reputation

4260
01:15:05,590 --> 01:15:05,600
gets a bad reputation
 

4261
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,470
gets a bad reputation
for not having very reproducible uh

4262
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:08,480
for not having very reproducible uh
 

4263
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:09,669
for not having very reproducible uh
results and some

4264
01:15:09,669 --> 01:15:09,679
results and some
 

4265
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:11,830
results and some
psychometrics as actually some fairly

4266
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:11,840
psychometrics as actually some fairly
 

4267
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,070

solidly or producible results
 

4269
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:17,430
solidly or producible results
so the ideal goals of the field is you

4270
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:17,440
so the ideal goals of the field is you
 

4271
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:18,870
so the ideal goals of the field is you
know tests should be

4272
01:15:18,870 --> 01:15:18,880
know tests should be
 

4273
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:21,669
know tests should be
be reliable which is a an ocean type

4274
01:15:21,669 --> 01:15:21,679
be reliable which is a an ocean type
 

4275
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:23,030
be reliable which is a an ocean type
reproducibility

4276
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:23,040

4277
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,830
reproducibility
it should be valid uh meaning that it

4278
01:15:25,830 --> 01:15:25,840
it should be valid uh meaning that it
 

4279
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,990
it should be valid uh meaning that it
should actually measure what you say

4280
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:28,000
should actually measure what you say
 

4281
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,110
should actually measure what you say
but you say it measures um so for

4282
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:31,120
but you say it measures um so for
 

4283
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,790
but you say it measures um so for
instance if you're if you're saying that

4284
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:32,800
instance if you're if you're saying that
 

4285
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,790
instance if you're if you're saying that
you're measuring intelligence then

4286
01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:34,800
you're measuring intelligence then
 

4287
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,270
you're measuring intelligence then
your test results should be created with

4288
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:37,280
your test results should be created with
 

4289
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,030
your test results should be created with
things that you expect to be correlated

4290
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:39,040
things that you expect to be correlated
 

4291
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:40,390
things that you expect to be correlated
with intelligence like

4292
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:40,400
with intelligence like
 

4293
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,070
with intelligence like
success in school or success in the

4294
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:42,080
success in school or success in the
 

4295
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,590
success in school or success in the
workplace and so on

4296
01:15:43,590 --> 01:15:43,600
workplace and so on
 

4297
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:46,470
workplace and so on
should be standardized meaning that you

4298
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:46,480
should be standardized meaning that you
 

4299
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:46,870
should be standardized meaning that you
can

4300
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:46,880
can
 

4301
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,550
can
administer your tests to many different

4302
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:48,560
administer your tests to many different
 

4303
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,709
administer your tests to many different
people in the same conditions

4304
01:15:50,709 --> 01:15:50,719
people in the same conditions
 

4305
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:53,110
people in the same conditions
and it should be free from bias meaning

4306
01:15:53,110 --> 01:15:53,120
and it should be free from bias meaning
 

4307
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,270
and it should be free from bias meaning
that for instance uh if you're if if

4308
01:15:55,270 --> 01:15:55,280
that for instance uh if you're if if
 

4309
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:56,790
that for instance uh if you're if if
your test involves

4310
01:15:56,790 --> 01:15:56,800
your test involves
 

4311
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,110
your test involves
uh the english language then you have to

4312
01:15:59,110 --> 01:15:59,120
uh the english language then you have to
 

4313
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,070
uh the english language then you have to
be aware that

4314
01:16:00,070 --> 01:16:00,080
be aware that
 

4315
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:02,550
be aware that
this creates a bias against people who

4316
01:16:02,550 --> 01:16:02,560
this creates a bias against people who
 

4317
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,390
this creates a bias against people who
have english as their second language or

4318
01:16:04,390 --> 01:16:04,400
have english as their second language or
 

4319
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:07,110
have english as their second language or
people who can't speak english at all

4320
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:07,120
people who can't speak english at all
 

4321
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,750
people who can't speak english at all
so of course these these principles for

4322
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:09,760
so of course these these principles for
 

4323
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:12,310
so of course these these principles for
creating psychometric tests are

4324
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:12,320
creating psychometric tests are
 

4325
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,390
creating psychometric tests are
very much nighty old i don't think every

4326
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:14,400
very much nighty old i don't think every
 

4327
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,430
very much nighty old i don't think every
psychometric test

4328
01:16:15,430 --> 01:16:15,440
psychometric test
 

4329
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:19,830
psychometric test
is is really either reliable

4330
01:16:19,830 --> 01:16:19,840
is is really either reliable
 

4331
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,790
is is really either reliable
valid or offer from bias but at least

4332
01:16:22,790 --> 01:16:22,800
valid or offer from bias but at least
 

4333
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,550
valid or offer from bias but at least
the field is aware

4334
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:24,560
the field is aware
 

4335
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,550
the field is aware
of these weaknesses and is trying to

4336
01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:26,560
of these weaknesses and is trying to
 

4337
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:27,590
of these weaknesses and is trying to
address them so

4338
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:27,600
address them so
 

4339
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:30,550
address them so
it's kind of interesting um ultimately

4340
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:30,560
it's kind of interesting um ultimately
 

4341
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:31,110
it's kind of interesting um ultimately
you're only

4342
01:16:31,110 --> 01:16:31,120
you're only
 

4343
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,790
you're only
able to measure like you said previously

4344
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:32,800
able to measure like you said previously
 

4345
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,390
able to measure like you said previously
the skill

4346
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:34,400
the skill
 

4347
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:35,990
the skill
but you're trying to do a bunch of

4348
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:36,000
but you're trying to do a bunch of
 

4349
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,669
but you're trying to do a bunch of
measures of different skills that

4350
01:16:37,669 --> 01:16:37,679
measures of different skills that
 

4351
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:40,470
measures of different skills that
correlate as you mentioned strongly with

4352
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:40,480
correlate as you mentioned strongly with
 

4353
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,149
correlate as you mentioned strongly with
some general concept of

4354
01:16:42,149 --> 01:16:42,159
some general concept of
 

4355
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:45,110
some general concept of
cognitive ability yes yes so what's the

4356
01:16:45,110 --> 01:16:45,120
cognitive ability yes yes so what's the
 

4357
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:45,350
cognitive ability yes yes so what's the
g

4358
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:45,360
g
 

4359
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,830

factor so right there are many different

4360
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:47,840
factor so right there are many different
 

4361
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:48,630
factor so right there are many different
kinds of

01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:48,640
kinds of
 

4363
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,910
kinds of
tests tests of intelligence and uh

4364
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:51,920
tests tests of intelligence and uh
 

4365
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:54,550
tests tests of intelligence and uh
each of them is interested in in uh

4366
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:54,560
each of them is interested in in uh
 

4367
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,070
each of them is interested in in uh
different aspects of intelligence you

4368
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:56,080
different aspects of intelligence you
 

4369
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,110
different aspects of intelligence you
know some of them will deal with

4370
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:57,120
know some of them will deal with
 

4371
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,070
know some of them will deal with
language some of them

4372
01:16:58,070 --> 01:16:58,080
language some of them
 

4373
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,270
language some of them
we deal with a special vision maybe

4374
01:17:01,270 --> 01:17:01,280
we deal with a special vision maybe
 

4375
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:04,470
we deal with a special vision maybe
mental rotations numbers and so on

4376
01:17:04,470 --> 01:17:04,480
mental rotations numbers and so on
 

4377
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:07,750
mental rotations numbers and so on
when you run these very different tests

4378
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:07,760
when you run these very different tests
 

4379
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:10,709
when you run these very different tests
at scale what you start seeing is that

4380
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:10,719
at scale what you start seeing is that
 

4381
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:12,709
at scale what you start seeing is that
there are clusters of correlations

4382
01:17:12,709 --> 01:17:12,719
there are clusters of correlations
 

4383
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:14,870
there are clusters of correlations
among test results so for instance if

4384
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:14,880
among test results so for instance if
 

4385
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,030
among test results so for instance if
you look at uh

4386
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:17,040
you look at uh
 

4387
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,750
you look at uh
homework at school um you will see that

4388
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:19,760
homework at school um you will see that
 

4389
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:20,149
homework at school um you will see that
people

4390
01:17:20,149 --> 01:17:20,159
people
 

4391
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:23,110
people
who do well at math are also likely

4392
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:23,120
who do well at math are also likely
 

4393
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,510
who do well at math are also likely
statistically to do well in physics

4394
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:25,520
statistically to do well in physics
 

4395
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,470
statistically to do well in physics
and what's more uh there there also

4396
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:28,480
and what's more uh there there also
 

4397
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:29,990
and what's more uh there there also
people do well at math and physics

4398
01:17:29,990 --> 01:17:30,000
people do well at math and physics
 

4399
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,550
people do well at math and physics
are also statistically likely to do well

4400
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:32,560
are also statistically likely to do well
 

4401
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,590
are also statistically likely to do well
in things that

4402
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:33,600
in things that
 

4403
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,229
in things that
sound completely unrelated like writing

01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:38,470
sound completely unrelated like writing
in english essay for instance

4406
01:17:38,470 --> 01:17:38,480
in english essay for instance
 

4407
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,550
in english essay for instance
and so when you see clusters of

4408
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:40,560
and so when you see clusters of
 

4409
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:41,910
and so when you see clusters of
correlations

4410
01:17:41,910 --> 01:17:41,920
correlations
 

4411
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:45,189
correlations
uh in in statical statistical terms you

4412
01:17:45,189 --> 01:17:45,199
uh in in statical statistical terms you
 

4413
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:46,709
uh in in statical statistical terms you
would explain them with a latent

4414
01:17:46,709 --> 01:17:46,719
would explain them with a latent
 

4415
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:47,590
would explain them with a latent
variable

4416
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:47,600
variable
 

4417
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:48,950
variable
and the latent variable that would for

4418
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:48,960
and the latent variable that would for
 

4419
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,110
and the latent variable that would for
instance explain uh

4420
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:51,120
instance explain uh
 

4421
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,630
instance explain uh
the relationship between being good at

01:17:52,630 --> 01:17:52,640
the relationship between being good at
 

4423
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:54,950
the relationship between being good at
math and being good at physics would be

4424
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:54,960
math and being good at physics would be
 

4425
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:59,110
math and being good at physics would be
cognitive ability right and the g factor

4426
01:17:59,110 --> 01:17:59,120
cognitive ability right and the g factor
 

4427
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,910
cognitive ability right and the g factor
is the the latent variable that explains

4428
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:01,920
is the the latent variable that explains
 

4429
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:03,350
is the the latent variable that explains
uh the fact that

4430
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:03,360
uh the fact that
 

4431
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:05,910
uh the fact that
every test of intelligence that you can

4432
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:05,920
every test of intelligence that you can
 

4433
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,270
every test of intelligence that you can
come up with

4434
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:07,280
come up with
 

4435
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,590
come up with
results on that on on this test end up

4436
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:09,600
results on that on on this test end up
 

4437
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,149
results on that on on this test end up
being correlated so there is some a

4438
01:18:12,149 --> 01:18:12,159
being correlated so there is some a
 

4439
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:15,510
being correlated so there is some a
single uh a unique variable

4440
01:18:15,510 --> 01:18:15,520
single uh a unique variable
 

4441
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,750
single uh a unique variable
uh that that explains this correlations

4442
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:17,760
uh that that explains this correlations
 

4443
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:18,790
uh that that explains this correlations
that's the g factor

4444
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:18,800
that's the g factor
 

4445
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,550
that's the g factor
so it's a statistical construct it's not

4446
01:18:20,550 --> 01:18:20,560
so it's a statistical construct it's not
 

4447
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,470
so it's a statistical construct it's not
really something you can directly

4448
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:22,480
really something you can directly
 

4449
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:25,669
really something you can directly
measure for instance in a person um but

4450
01:18:25,669 --> 01:18:25,679
measure for instance in a person um but
 

4451
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:26,470
measure for instance in a person um but
it's there

4452
01:18:26,470 --> 01:18:26,480
it's there
 

4453
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,229
it's there
but it's there it's there it's the art

4454
01:18:28,229 --> 01:18:28,239
but it's there it's there it's the art
 

4455
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:30,390
but it's there it's there it's the art
scale and that's also one thing i want

4456
01:18:30,390 --> 01:18:30,400
scale and that's also one thing i want
 

4457
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:31,430
scale and that's also one thing i want
to

4458
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:31,440
to
 

4459
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,750
to
mention about psychometrics like you

4460
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:33,760
mention about psychometrics like you
 

4461
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:35,350
mention about psychometrics like you
know when you talk about

4462
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:35,360
know when you talk about
 

4463
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,430
know when you talk about
measuring intelligence in in humans for

4464
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:37,440
measuring intelligence in in humans for
 

4465
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,189
measuring intelligence in in humans for
instance some people get

4466
01:18:39,189 --> 01:18:39,199
instance some people get
 

4467
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:40,470
instance some people get
a little bit worried they will say you

4468
01:18:40,470 --> 01:18:40,480
a little bit worried they will say you
 

4469
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,229
a little bit worried they will say you
know that sounds dangerous maybe that's

4470
01:18:42,229 --> 01:18:42,239
know that sounds dangerous maybe that's
 

4471
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:44,310
know that sounds dangerous maybe that's
not potentially discriminatory and so on

4472
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:44,320
not potentially discriminatory and so on
 

4473
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:44,950
not potentially discriminatory and so on
and

4474
01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:44,960
and
 

4475
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,590
and
they're not wrong and the thing is so

4476
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:47,600
they're not wrong and the thing is so
 

4477
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:48,950
they're not wrong and the thing is so
personally i'm not interested in

4478
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:48,960
personally i'm not interested in
 

4479
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:50,470
personally i'm not interested in
psychometrics

4480
01:18:50,470 --> 01:18:50,480
psychometrics
 

4481
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:54,149
psychometrics
as a way to characterize one individual

4482
01:18:54,149 --> 01:18:54,159
as a way to characterize one individual
 

4483
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:57,270
as a way to characterize one individual
person like if if i get

4484
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:57,280
person like if if i get
 

4485
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,990
person like if if i get
your psychometric personality assessment

4486
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:00,000
your psychometric personality assessment
 

4487
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,669
your psychometric personality assessment
or your iq i don't think that actually

4488
01:19:01,669 --> 01:19:01,679
or your iq i don't think that actually
 

4489
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:03,189
or your iq i don't think that actually
tells me much

4490
01:19:03,189 --> 01:19:03,199
tells me much
 

4491
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:05,189
tells me much
about you as a person i think

4492
01:19:05,189 --> 01:19:05,199
about you as a person i think
 

4493
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:08,390
about you as a person i think
psychometrics is most useful

4494
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:08,400
psychometrics is most useful
 

4495
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,630
psychometrics is most useful
as a statistical tool so it's most

4496
01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:10,640
as a statistical tool so it's most
 

4497
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:12,470
as a statistical tool so it's most
useful at scale

4498
01:19:12,470 --> 01:19:12,480
useful at scale
 

4499
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,630
useful at scale
it's most useful when you start getting

4500
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:14,640
it's most useful when you start getting
 

4501
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,070
it's most useful when you start getting
test results for

4502
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:16,080
test results for
 

4503
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,709
test results for
a large number of people and you start

4504
01:19:18,709 --> 01:19:18,719
a large number of people and you start
 

4505
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:20,550
a large number of people and you start
cross-correlating these test results

4506
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:20,560
cross-correlating these test results
 

4507
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:21,430
cross-correlating these test results
because

4508
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:21,440
because
 

4509
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:23,990
because
that gives you information about the

4510
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:24,000
that gives you information about the
 

4511
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,510
that gives you information about the
structure

4512
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:25,520
structure
 

4513
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,189
structure
of the human mind particularly about the

4514
01:19:27,189 --> 01:19:27,199
of the human mind particularly about the
 

4515
01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:29,750
of the human mind particularly about the
structure of human cognitive abilities

4516
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:29,760
structure of human cognitive abilities
 

4517
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:30,310
structure of human cognitive abilities
so

4518
01:19:30,310 --> 01:19:30,320
so
 

4519
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:33,590
so
at scale psychometrics paints

4520
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:33,600
at scale psychometrics paints
 

4521
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,669
at scale psychometrics paints
a certain picture of the human mind and

4522
01:19:35,669 --> 01:19:35,679
a certain picture of the human mind and
 

4523
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:37,110
a certain picture of the human mind and
that's interesting

4524
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:37,120
that's interesting
 

4525
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:39,030
that's interesting
and that's what's relevant to ai the

4526
01:19:39,030 --> 01:19:39,040
and that's what's relevant to ai the
 

4527
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,030
and that's what's relevant to ai the
structure of human currency abilities

4528
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:41,040
structure of human currency abilities
 

4529
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,870
structure of human currency abilities
yeah it gives you an insight into it i

4530
01:19:42,870 --> 01:19:42,880
yeah it gives you an insight into it i
 

4531
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,070
yeah it gives you an insight into it i
mean to me i remember when i learned

4532
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:44,080
mean to me i remember when i learned
 

4533
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:44,550
mean to me i remember when i learned
about g

4534
01:19:44,550 --> 01:19:44,560
about g
 

4535
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:49,270
about g
factor it seemed

4536
01:19:49,270 --> 01:19:49,280

 

4537
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,110

it it seemed like it would be impossible

4538
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:51,120
it it seemed like it would be impossible
 

4539
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,550
it it seemed like it would be impossible
for it even

4540
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:52,560
for it even
 

4541
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,950
for it even
it to be real even as a statistical

4542
01:19:54,950 --> 01:19:54,960
it to be real even as a statistical
 

4543
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,390
it to be real even as a statistical
variable like

4544
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:56,400
variable like
 

4545
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:59,110
variable like
it felt uh kind of like astrology like

4546
01:19:59,110 --> 01:19:59,120
it felt uh kind of like astrology like
 

4547
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,470
it felt uh kind of like astrology like
it's like wishful thinking among

4548
01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:00,480
it's like wishful thinking among
 

4549
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:01,990
it's like wishful thinking among
psychologists

4550
01:20:01,990 --> 01:20:02,000
psychologists
 

4551
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,149
psychologists
but uh the more i learned i realized

4552
01:20:04,149 --> 01:20:04,159
but uh the more i learned i realized
 

4553
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:05,510
but uh the more i learned i realized
that there's some

4554
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:05,520
that there's some
 

4555
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:06,950
that there's some
i mean i'm not sure what to make about

4556
01:20:06,950 --> 01:20:06,960
i mean i'm not sure what to make about
 

4557
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,470
i mean i'm not sure what to make about
human beings the fact that the jig

4558
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:08,480
human beings the fact that the jig
 

4559
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,070
human beings the fact that the jig
factor is a thing

4560
01:20:10,070 --> 01:20:10,080
factor is a thing
 

4561
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,990
factor is a thing
that there's a commonality across all of

4562
01:20:11,990 --> 01:20:12,000
that there's a commonality across all of
 

4563
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,189
that there's a commonality across all of
human species

4564
01:20:13,189 --> 01:20:13,199
human species
 

4565
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:14,790
human species
is there destiny to be a strong

4566
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:14,800
is there destiny to be a strong
 

4567
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,030
is there destiny to be a strong
correlation between cognitive abilities

4568
01:20:17,030 --> 01:20:17,040
correlation between cognitive abilities
 

4569
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,110
correlation between cognitive abilities
that's kind of fascinating yeah actually

4570
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:19,120
that's kind of fascinating yeah actually
 

4571
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,669
that's kind of fascinating yeah actually
so human connectivities have

4572
01:20:21,669 --> 01:20:21,679
so human connectivities have
 

4573
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:23,590
so human connectivities have
uh a structure like the the most

4574
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:23,600
uh a structure like the the most
 

4575
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,350
uh a structure like the the most

cancer abilities
 

4579
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:29,669
cancer abilities
it's called a chc theory it's a cattle

4580
01:20:29,669 --> 01:20:29,679
it's called a chc theory it's a cattle

4584
01:20:32,629 --> 01:20:32,639
it's name of the industry psychologist
 

4585
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:35,189
it's name of the industry psychologist
who contributed key pieces of it

4586
01:20:35,189 --> 01:20:35,199
who contributed key pieces of it
 

4587
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:38,550
who contributed key pieces of it
and it describes uh cognitive abilities

4588
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:38,560
and it describes uh cognitive abilities
 

4589
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,189
and it describes uh cognitive abilities

as a hierarchy with three levels and at
 

4591
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:43,110
as a hierarchy with three levels and at
the top you have the g-factor

4592
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:43,120
the top you have the g-factor
 

4593
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,990
the top you have the g-factor
then you have broad cognitive abilities

4594
01:20:45,990 --> 01:20:46,000
then you have broad cognitive abilities
 

4595
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,629
then you have broad cognitive abilities
for instance fluid intelligence right

4596
01:20:48,629 --> 01:20:48,639
for instance fluid intelligence right
 

4597

01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,870
that are all
related and then you have narrow

a hierarchy with a kind of g factor
 

4625
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:22,390
a hierarchy with a kind of g factor
at the top and you're right that the g

01:21:22,390 --> 01:21:22,400
at the top and you're right that the g
 

4627
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:23,669

something you can observe and measure
 

4635
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,629
something you can observe and measure
like your height for instance but it's

01:21:30,629 --> 01:21:30,639
like your height for instance but it's

right one thing i want to mention is

01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:38,880
right one thing i want to mention is
 

4645
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,790
right one thing i want to mention is
that the fact that there is a g-factor

4646
01:21:40,790 --> 01:21:40,800
that the fact that there is a g-factor
 

4647
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:41,990
that the fact that there is a g-factor
does not really mean that

4648
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:42,000
does not really mean that
 

4649
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,629
does not really mean that
human intelligence is a general in a

strong sense
 

4653
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:47,669
strong sense
does not mean human intentions can can

4654
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:47,679
does not mean human intentions can can
 

4655
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:49,669
does not mean human intentions can can
be applied to any problem

be applied to any problem
 

4657

be applied to any problem
at all and that someone who has a high

all that's not quite what it means i
think um

think um
 

4667
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:00,390
think um
one one popular analogy to understand it

4668
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:00,400
one one popular analogy to understand it
 

4669
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:03,990
one one popular analogy to understand it
is the sports analogy if you consider

4670
01:22:03,990 --> 01:22:04,000
is the sports analogy if you consider
 

4671
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,110
is the sports analogy if you consider
the concept of

4672
01:22:05,110 --> 01:22:05,120
the concept of
 

4673
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:07,669
the concept of
physical fitness it's a concept that's

4674
01:22:07,669 --> 01:22:07,679
physical fitness it's a concept that's
 

4675
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:09,750
physical fitness it's a concept that's
very similar to intelligence because

4676
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:09,760
very similar to intelligence because
 

4677
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:12,390
very similar to intelligence because
it's a useful concept it's something you

4678
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:12,400
it's a useful concept it's something you
 

4679
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:13,750
it's a useful concept it's something you
can intuitively

4680
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:13,760
can intuitively
 

4681
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:16,870
can intuitively
understand some people are fit uh maybe

4682
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:16,880
understand some people are fit uh maybe
 

4683
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:17,590
understand some people are fit uh maybe
like you

4684
01:22:17,590 --> 01:22:17,600
like you
 

4685
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,070
like you
some people are not as fit maybe like me

4686
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:20,080
some people are not as fit maybe like me
 

4687
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:23,030
some people are not as fit maybe like me
um but none of us can fly

4688
01:22:23,030 --> 01:22:23,040
um but none of us can fly
 

4689
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:25,590
um but none of us can fly
absolutely it's so constrained even if

4690
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:25,600
absolutely it's so constrained even if
 

4691
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:26,470
absolutely it's so constrained even if
you're very fit

4692
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:26,480
you're very fit
 

4693
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:29,510
you're very fit
that doesn't mean you can do uh anything

4694
01:22:29,510 --> 01:22:29,520
that doesn't mean you can do uh anything
 

4695
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:29,750
that doesn't mean you can do uh anything
at

4697
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,669
at
all in any environment you you obviously

4698
01:22:31,669 --> 01:22:31,679
all in any environment you you obviously
 

4699
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:33,750
all in any environment you you obviously
cannot fly you cannot uh survive at the

4700
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:33,760
cannot fly you cannot uh survive at the
 

4701
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:35,910
cannot fly you cannot uh survive at the
bottom of the ocean and so on

4702
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:35,920
bottom of the ocean and so on
 

4703
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:38,229
bottom of the ocean and so on
and if you were a scientist say you want

4704
01:22:38,229 --> 01:22:38,239
and if you were a scientist say you want
 

4705
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:40,149
and if you were a scientist say you want
you wanted to precisely

4706
01:22:40,149 --> 01:22:40,159
you wanted to precisely
 

4707
01:22:40,159 --> 01:22:42,950
you wanted to precisely
define and measure physical fitness in

4708
01:22:42,950 --> 01:22:42,960
define and measure physical fitness in
 

4709
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,709
define and measure physical fitness in
humans then you would come up with a

4710
01:22:44,709 --> 01:22:44,719
humans then you would come up with a
 

4711
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:45,590
humans then you would come up with a
battery

4712
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:45,600
battery
 

4713
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,910
battery
uh of tests uh like you would you know

4714
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:47,920
uh of tests uh like you would you know
 

4715
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:48,870
uh of tests uh like you would you know
have running

4716
01:22:48,870 --> 01:22:48,880
have running
 

4717
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:51,750
have running
android meter uh playing soccer playing

4718
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:51,760
android meter uh playing soccer playing
 

4719
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:54,149
android meter uh playing soccer playing
table tennis swimming and so on

4720
01:22:54,149 --> 01:22:54,159
table tennis swimming and so on
 

4721
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:57,669
table tennis swimming and so on
and uh if you run these tests over many

4722
01:22:57,669 --> 01:22:57,679
and uh if you run these tests over many
 

4723
01:22:57,679 --> 01:22:59,430
and uh if you run these tests over many
different people you will start seeing

4724
01:22:59,430 --> 01:22:59,440
different people you will start seeing
 

4725
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:01,430
different people you will start seeing
correlations and test results for

4726
01:23:01,430 --> 01:23:01,440
correlations and test results for
 

4727
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:02,950
correlations and test results for
instance people who are good at soccer

4728
01:23:02,950 --> 01:23:02,960
instance people who are good at soccer
 

4729
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:03,750
instance people who are good at soccer
are so good

4730
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:03,760
are so good
 

4731
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:06,870
are so good
at sprinting right and

4732
01:23:06,870 --> 01:23:06,880
at sprinting right and
 

4733
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:09,430
at sprinting right and
you will explain these correlations with

4734
01:23:09,430 --> 01:23:09,440
you will explain these correlations with
 

4735
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,189
you will explain these correlations with
physical abilities that are

4736
01:23:11,189 --> 01:23:11,199
physical abilities that are
 

4737
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:12,790
physical abilities that are
strictly analogous to cognitive

4738
01:23:12,790 --> 01:23:12,800
strictly analogous to cognitive
 

4739
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,709
strictly analogous to cognitive
abilities right and then you would start

4740
01:23:14,709 --> 01:23:14,719
abilities right and then you would start
 

4741
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:16,310
abilities right and then you would start
also observing

4742
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:16,320
also observing
 

4743
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:20,310
also observing
correlations between biological uh

4744
01:23:20,310 --> 01:23:20,320
correlations between biological uh
 

4745
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,709
correlations between biological uh
characteristics like maybe lung volume

4746
01:23:22,709 --> 01:23:22,719
characteristics like maybe lung volume
 

4747
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:24,310
characteristics like maybe lung volume
is correlated with being

4748
01:23:24,310 --> 01:23:24,320
is correlated with being
 

4749
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:27,350
is correlated with being
a a fast runner for instance uh in the

01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:27,360
a a fast runner for instance uh in the
 

4751
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,070
a a fast runner for instance uh in the
same way that

4752
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:28,080
same way that
 

4753
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:31,830
same way that

there are neurophysical uh correlates
 

4755
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:35,110
there are neurophysical uh correlates
of cognitive abilities right and at the

only do the things
 

4785
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:03,030
only do the things
and that we were evolved to do

01:24:03,030 --> 01:24:03,040
and that we were evolved to do
 

4787
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:06,229
and that we were evolved to do
right like we are not appropriate to to

4788
01:24:06,229 --> 01:24:06,239
right like we are not appropriate to to
 

4789
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:09,510
right like we are not appropriate to to
to you you could not exist on venus or

4790
01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:09,520
to you you could not exist on venus or
 

4791
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,189
to you you could not exist on venus or
mars or in the void of space

4792
01:24:11,189 --> 01:24:11,199
mars or in the void of space
 

4793
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:13,750
mars or in the void of space
but on the ocean so that said one thing

4794
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:13,760
but on the ocean so that said one thing
 

4795
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:15,270
but on the ocean so that said one thing
that's really striking

4796
01:24:15,270 --> 01:24:15,280
that's really striking
 

4797
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:19,350
that's really striking
and remarkable is that

4798
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:19,360
and remarkable is that
 

4799
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:23,030
and remarkable is that
our morphology generalizes

4800
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:23,040
our morphology generalizes
 

4801
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:25,990
our morphology generalizes
far beyond the environments that we

4802
01:24:25,990 --> 01:24:26,000
far beyond the environments that we
 

4803
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,110
far beyond the environments that we
evolved for

4804
01:24:27,110 --> 01:24:27,120
evolved for
 

4805
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:29,270
evolved for
like in a way you could say we evolved

4806
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:29,280
like in a way you could say we evolved
 

4807
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:30,310
like in a way you could say we evolved
to run

4808
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:30,320
to run
 

4809
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:33,270
to run
after prey in the seminar right that's

4810
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:33,280
after prey in the seminar right that's
 

4811
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:33,990
after prey in the seminar right that's
very much

4812
01:24:33,990 --> 01:24:34,000
very much
 

4813
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,790
very much
where our human morphology comes from

4814
01:24:36,790 --> 01:24:36,800
where our human morphology comes from
 

4815
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:37,830
where our human morphology comes from
and that said

4816
01:24:37,830 --> 01:24:37,840
and that said
 

4817
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:40,310
and that said
we can we can do a lot of things that

4818
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:40,320
we can we can do a lot of things that
 

4819
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,510
we can we can do a lot of things that
are that are

01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:41,520
are that are
 

4821
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,189
are that are
completely unrelated to that we can

01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:44,709
completely unrelated to that we can
climb mountains we can

4824
01:24:44,709 --> 01:24:44,719
climb mountains we can
 

4825
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:47,910
climb mountains we can
we can swim across lakes uh we can play

4826
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:47,920
we can swim across lakes uh we can play
 

4827
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,990
we can swim across lakes uh we can play
a table tennis i mean table tennis is

4828
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:50,000
a table tennis i mean table tennis is
 

4829
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,669
a table tennis i mean table tennis is
very different from what we were evolved

4830
01:24:51,669 --> 01:24:51,679
very different from what we were evolved
 

4831
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:53,030
very different from what we were evolved
to do right

01:24:53,030 --> 01:24:53,040
to do right
 

4833
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:55,669
to do right
so our morphology our bodies or our

01:24:55,669 --> 01:24:55,679
so our morphology our bodies or our

sense of motor affordances
 

4837
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,750
sense of motor affordances
are of a degree of generality that is

4838
01:24:59,750 --> 01:24:59,760
are of a degree of generality that is
 

4839
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,189
are of a degree of generality that is
absolutely remarkable

4840
01:25:01,189 --> 01:25:01,199
absolutely remarkable
 

4841
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:03,910
absolutely remarkable
right and i think cognition is very

4842
01:25:03,910 --> 01:25:03,920
right and i think cognition is very
 

4843
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:05,270
right and i think cognition is very
similar to that

4844
01:25:05,270 --> 01:25:05,280
similar to that
 

4845
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,590
similar to that
our cognitive abilities have a degree of

4846
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:07,600
our cognitive abilities have a degree of
 

4847
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,750
our cognitive abilities have a degree of
generality that goes far beyond

4848
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:09,760
generality that goes far beyond
 

4849
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,669
generality that goes far beyond
what the mind was initially supposed to

4850
01:25:11,669 --> 01:25:11,679
what the mind was initially supposed to
 

4851
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:13,750
what the mind was initially supposed to
do which is why we can you know play

4852
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:13,760
do which is why we can you know play
 

4853
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,430
do which is why we can you know play
music and write novels and

4854
01:25:15,430 --> 01:25:15,440
music and write novels and
 

4855
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,430
music and write novels and
and go to mass and do all kinds of crazy

4856
01:25:17,430 --> 01:25:17,440
and go to mass and do all kinds of crazy
 

4857
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,470
and go to mass and do all kinds of crazy
things

4858
01:25:18,470 --> 01:25:18,480
things
 

4859
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,709
things
but it's not universal in the same way

4860
01:25:20,709 --> 01:25:20,719
but it's not universal in the same way
 

4861
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:23,350
but it's not universal in the same way
that human morphology and our body

4862
01:25:23,350 --> 01:25:23,360
that human morphology and our body
 

4863
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:26,229
that human morphology and our body
is not appropriate for actually most of

4864
01:25:26,229 --> 01:25:26,239
is not appropriate for actually most of
 

4865
01:25:26,239 --> 01:25:27,750
is not appropriate for actually most of
the universe by volume

4866
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:27,760
the universe by volume
 

4867
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,030
the universe by volume
in the same way you could say that the

4868
01:25:29,030 --> 01:25:29,040
in the same way you could say that the
 

4869
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:30,790
in the same way you could say that the
human mind is naturally appropriate for

4870
01:25:30,790 --> 01:25:30,800
human mind is naturally appropriate for
 

4871
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:31,510
human mind is naturally appropriate for

by volume so we have very strong

4876
01:25:37,350 --> 01:25:37,360
by volume so we have very strong
 

4877
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:41,030
by volume so we have very strong
cognitive biases actually that mean that

4878
01:25:41,030 --> 01:25:41,040
cognitive biases actually that mean that
 

4879
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:42,629
cognitive biases actually that mean that
there are certain types of problems that

4880

there are certain types of problems that
 

4881
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:44,229
there are certain types of problems that
we handle very well and certain

4882
01:25:44,229 --> 01:25:44,239
we handle very well and certain
 

4883
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:46,629
we handle very well and certain
certain types of problem that we are

completely adapted for
 

4887
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:51,510
completely adapted for
so that's really how we interpret

4888
01:25:51,510 --> 01:25:51,520
so that's really how we interpret
 

4889
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:54,070
so that's really how we interpret
the g-factor it's not a sign of strong

4890
01:25:54,070 --> 01:25:54,080
the g-factor it's not a sign of strong

generality
 

4893
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,550
generality
it's it's really just a broader the

4894
01:25:58,550 --> 01:25:58,560
it's it's really just a broader the
 

4895
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:01,030
it's it's really just a broader the

4897
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:03,189
broadest cognitive ability
but our abilities whether we are talking

4898
01:26:03,189 --> 01:26:03,199
but our abilities whether we are talking
 

4899
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:05,270
but our abilities whether we are talking
about sensory motor abilities

4900
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:05,280
about sensory motor abilities
 

4901
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,510
about sensory motor abilities
or cognitive abilities they still they

4902
01:26:07,510 --> 01:26:07,520
or cognitive abilities they still they
 

4903
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,510
or cognitive abilities they still they
remain very specialized

4904
01:26:09,510 --> 01:26:09,520
remain very specialized
 

4905
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:12,550
remain very specialized
in the human condition right

4906
01:26:12,550 --> 01:26:12,560
in the human condition right
 

4907
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:14,870
in the human condition right
within the constraints of the human

4908
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:14,880
within the constraints of the human

cognition

4910
01:26:16,550 --> 01:26:16,560

4911
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:19,590
cognition
they're general yes absolutely so but

4912
01:26:19,590 --> 01:26:19,600
they're general yes absolutely so but
 

4913
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:20,870
they're general yes absolutely so but
the constraints as you're saying are

4914
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:20,880
the constraints as you're saying are
 

4915
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:21,669
the constraints as you're saying are
very limited

4916
01:26:21,669 --> 01:26:21,679
very limited
 

4917
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:24,390
very limited
what i think what's yeah limiting so we

4918
01:26:24,390 --> 01:26:24,400
what i think what's yeah limiting so we
 

4919
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:25,430
what i think what's yeah limiting so we
we evolved

4920
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:25,440
we evolved
 

4921
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:27,750
we evolved
our cognition and our body evolved in in

4922
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:27,760
our cognition and our body evolved in in
 

4923
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:29,350
our cognition and our body evolved in in
very specific environments

4924
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:29,360
very specific environments
 

4925
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:31,830
very specific environments
because our environment was so viable

4926
01:26:31,830 --> 01:26:31,840
because our environment was so viable
 

4927
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:34,470
because our environment was so viable
fast changing and so unpredictable

4928
01:26:34,470 --> 01:26:34,480
fast changing and so unpredictable

01:26:36,709 --> 01:26:36,719
part of the constraints that that drove
 

4931
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:37,669
part of the constraints that that drove
our evolution

4932
01:26:37,669 --> 01:26:37,679
our evolution
 

4933
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:40,310
our evolution
is generality itself so we were in a way

4934
01:26:40,310 --> 01:26:40,320
is generality itself so we were in a way
 

4935
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,110
is generality itself so we were in a way
evolved to

01:26:41,110 --> 01:26:41,120
evolved to
 

4937
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:43,830
evolved to
to be able to improvise in all kinds of

01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:47,590
physical
or cognitive environments right yeah um

4942
01:26:47,590 --> 01:26:47,600
or cognitive environments right yeah um
 

4943
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:50,709
or cognitive environments right yeah um
and for this reason it turns out that

4944
01:26:50,709 --> 01:26:50,719
and for this reason it turns out that
 

4945
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:53,270
and for this reason it turns out that
uh the the minds and bodies that we

4946
01:26:53,270 --> 01:26:53,280
uh the the minds and bodies that we
 

4947
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:54,629
uh the the minds and bodies that we
ended up with

4948
01:26:54,629 --> 01:26:54,639
ended up with
 

4949
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:57,270
ended up with
uh can be applied to much much broader

4950
01:26:57,270 --> 01:26:57,280
uh can be applied to much much broader
 

4951
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:57,990
uh can be applied to much much broader

01:26:59,990 --> 01:27:00,000
than what they were evolved for right
 

4955
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,750
than what they were evolved for right
and that's truly remarkable

4956
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:01,760
and that's truly remarkable
 

4957
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,270
and that's truly remarkable
and that goes that's the degree of

and that goes that's the degree of
 

4959

um that's it it does not mean that that
 

4967

01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:46,149
think so
the the thing to keep in mind is that

5000
01:27:46,149 --> 01:27:46,159
the the thing to keep in mind is that
 

5001
01:27:46,159 --> 01:27:48,229
the the thing to keep in mind is that
there's no such thing as

5007
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:54,070

it has to be difficult to respect to the
 

5009
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:55,669
it has to be difficult to respect to the
things you already know

01:27:55,669 --> 01:27:55,679
things you already know
 

5011
01:27:55,679 --> 01:27:58,550
things you already know
and the things you can already do right

01:27:58,550 --> 01:27:58,560
and the things you can already do right
 

5013
01:27:58,560 --> 01:27:59,350
and the things you can already do right
so

5014
01:27:59,350 --> 01:27:59,360
so
 

5015
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:02,709
so
in in terms of an iq test question

01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:05,990
typically you would have it will be
structured for instance

5020
01:28:05,990 --> 01:28:06,000

input and output pairs right and then

5024
01:28:12,149 --> 01:28:12,159
input and output pairs right and then
 

5025
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:13,030
input and output pairs right and then
you would be given

5026
01:28:13,030 --> 01:28:13,040
you would be given
 

5027
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:16,310
you would be given
a test input a prompt and you you

5028
01:28:16,310 --> 01:28:16,320
a test input a prompt and you you
 

5029
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,550
a test input a prompt and you you
you would need to recognize or produce

5030
01:28:18,550 --> 01:28:18,560
you would need to recognize or produce
 

5031
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:20,310
you would need to recognize or produce
the corresponding output

5032
01:28:20,310 --> 01:28:20,320
the corresponding output
 

5033
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:23,669
the corresponding output
and in that narrow context you could say

5034
01:28:23,669 --> 01:28:23,679
and in that narrow context you could say
 

5035
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:24,550
and in that narrow context you could say
a difficult

01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:24,560
a difficult
 

5037
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:28,310
a difficult
question is a question where

question is a question where
 

5039
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:31,590
question is a question where
um the input prompt is

5040
01:28:31,590 --> 01:28:31,600
um the input prompt is
 

5041
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:35,270
um the input prompt is
very surprising and unexpected given the

5042
01:28:35,270 --> 01:28:35,280
very surprising and unexpected given the
 

5043
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,110
very surprising and unexpected given the
the training examples just even the

5044
01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:37,120
the training examples just even the
 

5045
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,550
the training examples just even the
nature of the patterns that you're

01:28:38,550 --> 01:28:38,560
nature of the patterns that you're
 

5047
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:40,070
nature of the patterns that you're
observing in the input problem

5048

observing in the input problem
 

5049
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:41,750
observing in the input problem
for instance let's say you have a

5050
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:41,760
for instance let's say you have a
 

5051
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:43,189
for instance let's say you have a
rotation problem

5052
01:28:43,189 --> 01:28:43,199
rotation problem
 

5053
01:28:43,199 --> 01:28:46,629
rotation problem
you must rotate the shape by 90 degrees

5054
01:28:46,629 --> 01:28:46,639
you must rotate the shape by 90 degrees
 

5055
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:48,390
you must rotate the shape by 90 degrees
if i give you two examples and then i'll

5056
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:48,400
if i give you two examples and then i'll
 

5057
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:49,910
if i give you two examples and then i'll
give you one one

5058
01:28:49,910 --> 01:28:49,920
give you one one
 

5059
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:51,669
give you one one
prompt which is actually one of the two

5060
01:28:51,669 --> 01:28:51,679
prompt which is actually one of the two
 

5061
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:52,950
prompt which is actually one of the two
training examples

5062
01:28:52,950 --> 01:28:52,960
training examples
 

5063
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:54,870
training examples
then there is zero generalization

5064
01:28:54,870 --> 01:28:54,880
then there is zero generalization
 

5065
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:56,709
then there is zero generalization
difficulty for the task it's actually

5066
01:28:56,709 --> 01:28:56,719
difficulty for the task it's actually
 

5067
01:28:56,719 --> 01:28:57,510
difficulty for the task it's actually
triggered task

5068
01:28:57,510 --> 01:28:57,520
triggered task
 

5069
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:59,830
triggered task
you just recognize that it's one one of

5070
01:28:59,830 --> 01:28:59,840
you just recognize that it's one one of
 

5071
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,189
you just recognize that it's one one of
the training examples and you produce

5072
01:29:01,189 --> 01:29:01,199
the training examples and you produce
 

5073
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:02,229
the training examples and you produce
the same answer

5074
01:29:02,229 --> 01:29:02,239
the same answer
 

5075
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:04,790
the same answer
now if it's uh if it's a more complex

5076
01:29:04,790 --> 01:29:04,800
now if it's uh if it's a more complex
 

5077
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:05,510
now if it's uh if it's a more complex
shape

5078
01:29:05,510 --> 01:29:05,520
shape
 

5079
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:07,030
shape
there is you know a little bit more

5080
01:29:07,030 --> 01:29:07,040
there is you know a little bit more
 

5081
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:08,870
there is you know a little bit more
generalization but it remains that

5083
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:11,350
generalization but it remains that
you are still doing the same thing at

01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:11,360
you are still doing the same thing at

consider i don't know you're teaching a

5100
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:29,520
consider i don't know you're teaching a

um if
 

5107
01:29:35,199 --> 01:29:38,629
um if
uh if you wanted to kind of test

5108

the understanding that students have of

5110
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:40,719
the understanding that students have of
 

5111
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:43,430
the understanding that students have of
the material you would come up with

5112
01:29:43,430 --> 01:29:43,440
the material you would come up with
 

5113
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:46,870
the material you would come up with
an exam that's very different

5114
01:29:46,870 --> 01:29:46,880
an exam that's very different
 

5115
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:49,430
an exam that's very different
from anything they've seen like on the

5116
01:29:49,430 --> 01:29:49,440
from anything they've seen like on the
 

5117
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:49,990
from anything they've seen like on the
internet

5118
01:29:49,990 --> 01:29:50,000
internet
 

5119
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,310
internet
when they were cramming uh on the other

5120
01:29:52,310 --> 01:29:52,320
when they were cramming uh on the other
 

5121
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,709
when they were cramming uh on the other
hand if you wanted to make it easy

5122
01:29:54,709 --> 01:29:54,719
hand if you wanted to make it easy
 

5123
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:56,229
hand if you wanted to make it easy
you would just give them something

5124
01:29:56,229 --> 01:29:56,239
you would just give them something
 

5125
01:29:56,239 --> 01:29:58,629
you would just give them something
that's very similar

5126
01:29:58,629 --> 01:29:58,639
that's very similar
 

5127
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:01,270
that's very similar
to the the mock exams that that that

5128
01:30:01,270 --> 01:30:01,280
to the the mock exams that that that
 

5129
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:02,390
to the the mock exams that that that
they've taken

5130
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:02,400
they've taken
 

5131
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,830
they've taken
something that's just a simple

5132
01:30:03,830 --> 01:30:03,840
something that's just a simple
 

5133
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,270
something that's just a simple
interpolation of questions that they've

5134
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:05,280
interpolation of questions that they've
 

5135
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:07,270
interpolation of questions that they've
they've already seen

5136
01:30:07,270 --> 01:30:07,280
they've already seen
 

5137
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:09,510
they've already seen
and so that would be an easy exam it's

5138
01:30:09,510 --> 01:30:09,520
and so that would be an easy exam it's
 

5139
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:11,270
and so that would be an easy exam it's
very similar to what you've been trained

5140
01:30:11,270 --> 01:30:11,280
very similar to what you've been trained
 

5141
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:11,910
very similar to what you've been trained
on

5142
01:30:11,910 --> 01:30:11,920
on
 

5143
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:14,070
on
and a difficult exam is one that really

5144
01:30:14,070 --> 01:30:14,080
and a difficult exam is one that really
 

5145
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,910
and a difficult exam is one that really
probes your understanding because it

5146
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:15,920
probes your understanding because it
 

5147
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:17,830
probes your understanding because it
forces you

5148
01:30:17,830 --> 01:30:17,840
forces you
 

5149
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:21,350
forces you
to improvise it forces you to do things

5150
01:30:21,350 --> 01:30:21,360
to improvise it forces you to do things
 

5151
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:23,510
to improvise it forces you to do things
uh that are different from what you were

5152
01:30:23,510 --> 01:30:23,520
uh that are different from what you were
 

5153
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:24,709
uh that are different from what you were
exposed to before

5154
01:30:24,709 --> 01:30:24,719
exposed to before
 

5155
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:28,390
exposed to before
so that said it doesn't mean that the

5156
01:30:28,390 --> 01:30:28,400
so that said it doesn't mean that the
 

5157
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,950
so that said it doesn't mean that the
exam that requires improvisation is

5158
01:30:30,950 --> 01:30:30,960
exam that requires improvisation is
 

5159
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:33,189
exam that requires improvisation is
intrinsically hard right because maybe

5160
01:30:33,189 --> 01:30:33,199
intrinsically hard right because maybe
 

5161
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:34,790
intrinsically hard right because maybe
you're you're a quantum physics

5162
01:30:34,790 --> 01:30:34,800
you're you're a quantum physics
 

5163
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:37,430
you're you're a quantum physics
expert so when you take the exam this is

5164
01:30:37,430 --> 01:30:37,440
expert so when you take the exam this is
 

5165
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,270
expert so when you take the exam this is
actually stuff that despite being you

5166
01:30:39,270 --> 01:30:39,280
actually stuff that despite being you
 

5167
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:41,590
actually stuff that despite being you
new to the students it's not new to you

5168
01:30:41,590 --> 01:30:41,600
new to the students it's not new to you
 

5169
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:44,629
new to the students it's not new to you
right so it can only be difficult

5170
01:30:44,629 --> 01:30:44,639
right so it can only be difficult
 

5171
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:48,070
right so it can only be difficult
with respect to what the test taker

5172
01:30:48,070 --> 01:30:48,080
with respect to what the test taker
 

5173
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:50,790
with respect to what the test taker
already knows and with respect to the

5174
01:30:50,790 --> 01:30:50,800
already knows and with respect to the
 

5175
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:51,669
already knows and with respect to the
information

5176
01:30:51,669 --> 01:30:51,679
information
 

5177
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:54,550
information
that the test taker has about the task

5178
01:30:54,550 --> 01:30:54,560
that the test taker has about the task
 

5179
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:55,110
that the test taker has about the task
so

5180
01:30:55,110 --> 01:30:55,120
so
 

5181
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:57,030
so
that's what i mean by controlling for

5182
01:30:57,030 --> 01:30:57,040
that's what i mean by controlling for
 

5183
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,310
that's what i mean by controlling for
priors what you

5184
01:30:58,310 --> 01:30:58,320
priors what you
 

5185
01:30:58,320 --> 01:30:59,830
priors what you
the information you bring to the table

5186
01:30:59,830 --> 01:30:59,840
the information you bring to the table
 

5187
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:01,750
the information you bring to the table
and the exp and experience which is

5188
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:01,760
and the exp and experience which is
 

5189
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,830
and the exp and experience which is
the training data so in in the case of

5190
01:31:03,830 --> 01:31:03,840
the training data so in in the case of
 

5191
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,830
the training data so in in the case of
the the quantum physics exam that would

5192
01:31:05,830 --> 01:31:05,840
the the quantum physics exam that would
 

5193
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:06,629
the the quantum physics exam that would
be

5194
01:31:06,629 --> 01:31:06,639
be
 

5195
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:09,189
be
uh all the the the course material

5196
01:31:09,189 --> 01:31:09,199
uh all the the the course material
 

5197
01:31:09,199 --> 01:31:10,950
uh all the the the course material
itself and all the mock exams that

5198
01:31:10,950 --> 01:31:10,960
itself and all the mock exams that
 

5199
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:12,709
itself and all the mock exams that
students might have taken online

5200
01:31:12,709 --> 01:31:12,719
students might have taken online
 

5201
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:15,189
students might have taken online
yeah it's interesting because um i've

5202
01:31:15,189 --> 01:31:15,199
yeah it's interesting because um i've
 

5203
01:31:15,199 --> 01:31:16,229
yeah it's interesting because um i've
also i

5204
01:31:16,229 --> 01:31:16,239
also i
 

5205
01:31:16,239 --> 01:31:18,629
also i
i sent you an email and i asked you like

5206
01:31:18,629 --> 01:31:18,639
i sent you an email and i asked you like
 

5207
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:19,830
i sent you an email and i asked you like
i've been

5208
01:31:19,830 --> 01:31:19,840
i've been
 

5209
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:24,149
i've been
this just this curious question of um

5210
01:31:24,149 --> 01:31:24,159
this just this curious question of um
 

5211
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:26,470
this just this curious question of um
you know what's a really hard iq test

5212
01:31:26,470 --> 01:31:26,480
you know what's a really hard iq test
 

5213
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:27,430
you know what's a really hard iq test
question

5214
01:31:27,430 --> 01:31:27,440
question
 

5215
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:30,550
question
and i've been talking to also people who

5216
01:31:30,550 --> 01:31:30,560
and i've been talking to also people who
 

5217
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:32,310
and i've been talking to also people who
have designed iq tests

5218
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:32,320
have designed iq tests
 

5219
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,750
have designed iq tests
there's a few folks on the internet it's

5220
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:33,760
there's a few folks on the internet it's
 

5221
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,350
there's a few folks on the internet it's
like a thing people are really

5222
01:31:35,350 --> 01:31:35,360
like a thing people are really
 

5223
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:37,270
like a thing people are really
curious about it first of all most of

5224
01:31:37,270 --> 01:31:37,280
curious about it first of all most of
 

5225
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,350
curious about it first of all most of
the iq tests they designed

5226
01:31:39,350 --> 01:31:39,360
the iq tests they designed
 

5227
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:42,790
the iq tests they designed
they like religiously

5228
01:31:42,790 --> 01:31:42,800
they like religiously
 

5229
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:45,830
they like religiously
protect against the correct answers like

5230
01:31:45,830 --> 01:31:45,840
protect against the correct answers like
 

5231
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,430
protect against the correct answers like
you can't find the correct answers

5232
01:31:47,430 --> 01:31:47,440
you can't find the correct answers
 

5233
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:48,229
you can't find the correct answers
anywhere

5234
01:31:48,229 --> 01:31:48,239
anywhere
 

5235
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:50,229
anywhere
in fact the question is ruined once you

5236
01:31:50,229 --> 01:31:50,239
in fact the question is ruined once you
 

5237
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:51,350
in fact the question is ruined once you
know even like

5238
01:31:51,350 --> 01:31:51,360
know even like
 

5239
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:53,750
know even like
the approach you're supposed to take so

5240
01:31:53,750 --> 01:31:53,760
the approach you're supposed to take so
 

5241
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:54,790
the approach you're supposed to take so
they're very

5242
01:31:54,790 --> 01:31:54,800
they're very
 

5243
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:57,270
they're very
the approach is implicit in in the

01:31:57,270 --> 01:31:57,280
the approach is implicit in in the
 

5245
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:59,110
the approach is implicit in in the
training examples so here it is the

5246
01:31:59,110 --> 01:31:59,120
training examples so here it is the
 

5247
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:01,910
training examples so here it is the
training examples it's over

5248
01:32:01,910 --> 01:32:01,920
training examples it's over
 

5249
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,950
training examples it's over
well which is why in arc for instance

5250
01:32:04,950 --> 01:32:04,960
well which is why in arc for instance
 

5251
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:06,950
well which is why in arc for instance
there is a test set that is private and

5252
01:32:06,950 --> 01:32:06,960
there is a test set that is private and
 

5253
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:09,110
there is a test set that is private and
no one has seen it

5254
01:32:09,110 --> 01:32:09,120
no one has seen it
 

5255
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:12,229
no one has seen it
no for really tough iq questions it's

5256
01:32:12,229 --> 01:32:12,239
no for really tough iq questions it's
 

5257
01:32:12,239 --> 01:32:12,629
no for really tough iq questions it's
not

5258
01:32:12,629 --> 01:32:12,639
not
 

5259
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:17,030
not
obvious it's not because the ambiguity

5260
01:32:17,030 --> 01:32:17,040
obvious it's not because the ambiguity
 

5261
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:20,149
obvious it's not because the ambiguity
like it's uh and you have to

5262
01:32:20,149 --> 01:32:20,159
like it's uh and you have to
 

5263
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:21,750
like it's uh and you have to
look to them but like some number

5264
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:21,760
look to them but like some number
 

5265
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:23,350
look to them but like some number
sequences and so on it's not

5266
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:23,360
sequences and so on it's not
 

5267
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:25,990
sequences and so on it's not
completely clear so like you can get a

5268
01:32:25,990 --> 01:32:26,000
completely clear so like you can get a
 

5269
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,750
completely clear so like you can get a
sense but

5270
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:27,760
sense but
 

5271
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:31,350
sense but
there's like some you know when you look

5272
01:32:31,350 --> 01:32:31,360
there's like some you know when you look
 

5273
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,350
there's like some you know when you look
at a number sequence i don't know

5274
01:32:33,350 --> 01:32:33,360
at a number sequence i don't know
 

5275
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:37,510
at a number sequence i don't know
uh like your fibonacci number sequence

5276
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:37,520
uh like your fibonacci number sequence
 

5277
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,350
uh like your fibonacci number sequence
if you look at the first few numbers

5278
01:32:39,350 --> 01:32:39,360
if you look at the first few numbers
 

5279
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:40,790
if you look at the first few numbers
that sequence could be completed in a

5280
01:32:40,790 --> 01:32:40,800
that sequence could be completed in a
 

5281
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,870
that sequence could be completed in a
lot of different ways

5282
01:32:42,870 --> 01:32:42,880
lot of different ways
 

5283
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:45,110
lot of different ways
and you know some are if you think

5284
01:32:45,110 --> 01:32:45,120
and you know some are if you think
 

5285
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:46,790
and you know some are if you think
deeply or more correct than others

5286
01:32:46,790 --> 01:32:46,800
deeply or more correct than others
 

5287
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:50,470
deeply or more correct than others
like there's a kind of intuitive

5288
01:32:50,470 --> 01:32:50,480
like there's a kind of intuitive
 

5289
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:52,470
like there's a kind of intuitive
simplicity and elegance to the correct

5290
01:32:52,470 --> 01:32:52,480
simplicity and elegance to the correct
 

5291
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:53,590
simplicity and elegance to the correct
solution yes

5292
01:32:53,590 --> 01:32:53,600
solution yes
 

5293
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:56,390
solution yes
i am personally not a fan of ambiguity

5294
01:32:56,390 --> 01:32:56,400
i am personally not a fan of ambiguity
 

5295
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:56,870
i am personally not a fan of ambiguity
in

5296
01:32:56,870 --> 01:32:56,880
in
 

5297
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:59,510
in
in test questions actually but i think

5298
01:32:59,510 --> 01:32:59,520
in test questions actually but i think
 

5299
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,790
in test questions actually but i think
you can have difficulty

5300
01:33:00,790 --> 01:33:00,800
you can have difficulty
 

5301
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:03,750
you can have difficulty
uh without requiring ambiguity simply by

5302
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:03,760
uh without requiring ambiguity simply by
 

5303
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:05,270
uh without requiring ambiguity simply by
making the test

5304
01:33:05,270 --> 01:33:05,280
making the test
 

5305
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:08,310
making the test
uh require a lot of extrapolation over

5306
01:33:08,310 --> 01:33:08,320
uh require a lot of extrapolation over
 

5307
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:09,430
uh require a lot of extrapolation over
the training examples

5308
01:33:09,430 --> 01:33:09,440
the training examples
 

5309
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:12,470
the training examples
but the beautiful question

5310
01:33:12,470 --> 01:33:12,480
but the beautiful question
 

5311
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,390
but the beautiful question
is difficult but gives away everything

5312
01:33:14,390 --> 01:33:14,400
is difficult but gives away everything
 

5313
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:17,110
is difficult but gives away everything
when you give the training example

5314
01:33:17,110 --> 01:33:17,120
when you give the training example
 

5315
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:20,550
when you give the training example
basically yes meaning that so

5316
01:33:20,550 --> 01:33:20,560
basically yes meaning that so
 

5317
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:23,510
basically yes meaning that so
the the tests i'm interested in in

5318
01:33:23,510 --> 01:33:23,520
the the tests i'm interested in in
 

5319
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:24,149
the the tests i'm interested in in
creating

5320
01:33:24,149 --> 01:33:24,159

are not necessarily difficult uh for

5322
01:33:26,709 --> 01:33:26,719
are not necessarily difficult uh for
 

5323
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:27,669
are not necessarily difficult uh for
humans

5324
01:33:27,669 --> 01:33:27,679
humans
 

5325
01:33:27,679 --> 01:33:30,070
humans
because uh human intelligence is the

5326
01:33:30,070 --> 01:33:30,080
because uh human intelligence is the
 

5327
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:31,189
because uh human intelligence is the
benchmark

5328
01:33:31,189 --> 01:33:31,199
benchmark
 

5329
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:33,510
benchmark
uh they're supposed to be difficult uh

5330
01:33:33,510 --> 01:33:33,520
uh they're supposed to be difficult uh
 

5331
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:34,310
uh they're supposed to be difficult uh
for machines

5332
01:33:34,310 --> 01:33:34,320
for machines
 

5333
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:36,390
for machines
in ways that are easy for humans like i

5334
01:33:36,390 --> 01:33:36,400
in ways that are easy for humans like i
 

5335
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:37,990
in ways that are easy for humans like i
think an ideal

5336
01:33:37,990 --> 01:33:38,000
think an ideal
 

5337
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,750
think an ideal
uh test of human and machine

5338
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:39,760
uh test of human and machine
 

5339
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:42,070
uh test of human and machine
intelligence is a test that is

5340
01:33:42,070 --> 01:33:42,080
intelligence is a test that is
 

5341
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:45,110
intelligence is a test that is
uh actionable uh that

5342
01:33:45,110 --> 01:33:45,120
uh actionable uh that
 

5343
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:48,149
uh actionable uh that
highlights uh the need for progress

5344
01:33:48,149 --> 01:33:48,159
highlights uh the need for progress
 

5345
01:33:48,159 --> 01:33:50,070
highlights uh the need for progress
and that highlights the direction in

5346
01:33:50,070 --> 01:33:50,080
and that highlights the direction in
 

5347
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:51,910
and that highlights the direction in
which you should be making progress i i

5348
01:33:51,910 --> 01:33:51,920
which you should be making progress i i
 

5349
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:52,550
which you should be making progress i i
think

5350
01:33:52,550 --> 01:33:52,560
think
 

5351
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,310
think
we'll talk about the arc challenge and

5352
01:33:54,310 --> 01:33:54,320
we'll talk about the arc challenge and
 

5353
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:55,750
we'll talk about the arc challenge and
the test you've constructed you have

5354
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:55,760
the test you've constructed you have
 

5355
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:57,990
the test you've constructed you have
these elegant examples

5356
01:33:57,990 --> 01:33:58,000
these elegant examples
 

5357
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,669
these elegant examples
i think that highlight like this is

5358
01:33:59,669 --> 01:33:59,679
i think that highlight like this is
 

5359
01:33:59,679 --> 01:34:01,750
i think that highlight like this is
really easy for us humans

5360
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:01,760
really easy for us humans
 

5361
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:04,870
really easy for us humans
but it's really hard for machines but

5362
01:34:04,870 --> 01:34:04,880
but it's really hard for machines but
 

5363
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:09,270
but it's really hard for machines but
on the you know the designing an iq test

5364
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:09,280
on the you know the designing an iq test
 

5365
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:12,390
on the you know the designing an iq test
for iqs of like a higher than 160 and so

5366
01:34:12,390 --> 01:34:12,400
for iqs of like a higher than 160 and so
 

5367
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:13,270
for iqs of like a higher than 160 and so
on

5368
01:34:13,270 --> 01:34:13,280
on
 

5369
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:15,110
on
you have to say you have to take that

5370
01:34:15,110 --> 01:34:15,120
you have to say you have to take that
 

5371
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:16,709
you have to say you have to take that
and put on steroids right you have to

5372
01:34:16,709 --> 01:34:16,719
and put on steroids right you have to
 

5373
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:17,990
and put on steroids right you have to
think like what is hard for

5374
01:34:17,990 --> 01:34:18,000
think like what is hard for
 

5375
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,990
think like what is hard for
humans and that's a fascinating exercise

5376
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:22,000
humans and that's a fascinating exercise
 

5377
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,910
humans and that's a fascinating exercise
in in itself i think

5378
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:25,920

 

5379
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,910

and it was an interesting question of

5380
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:27,920
and it was an interesting question of
 

5381
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:30,950
and it was an interesting question of
what it takes to create a really hard

5382
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:30,960
what it takes to create a really hard
 

5383
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:34,310
what it takes to create a really hard
question for humans because um

5384
01:34:34,310 --> 01:34:34,320
question for humans because um
 

5385
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:36,390
question for humans because um
you again have to do the same process as

5386
01:34:36,390 --> 01:34:36,400
you again have to do the same process as
 

5387
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:37,430
you again have to do the same process as
you mentioned which is

5388
01:34:37,430 --> 01:34:37,440
you mentioned which is
 

5389
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:42,229
you mentioned which is
uh you know something

5390
01:34:42,229 --> 01:34:42,239
uh you know something
 

5391
01:34:42,239 --> 01:34:45,350
uh you know something
basically where the experience that you

5392
01:34:45,350 --> 01:34:45,360
basically where the experience that you
 

5393
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:46,790
basically where the experience that you
have likely to have encountered

5394
01:34:46,790 --> 01:34:46,800
have likely to have encountered
 

5395
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:47,430
have likely to have encountered
throughout

5396
01:34:47,430 --> 01:34:47,440
throughout
 

5397
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:50,310
throughout
your whole life even if you've prepared

5398
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:50,320
your whole life even if you've prepared
 

5399
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:50,950
your whole life even if you've prepared
for iq

5400
01:34:50,950 --> 01:34:50,960
for iq
 

5401
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:53,669
for iq
tests which is a big challenge that this

5402
01:34:53,669 --> 01:34:53,679
tests which is a big challenge that this
 

5403
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:55,669
tests which is a big challenge that this
will still be novel for you

5404
01:34:55,669 --> 01:34:55,679
will still be novel for you
 

5405
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:58,870
will still be novel for you
yeah i mean novelty is a requirement

5406
01:34:58,870 --> 01:34:58,880
yeah i mean novelty is a requirement
 

5407
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:01,189
yeah i mean novelty is a requirement
you should not be able to practice for

5408
01:35:01,189 --> 01:35:01,199
you should not be able to practice for
 

5409
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:03,030
you should not be able to practice for
the questions that you're gonna be

5410
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:03,040
the questions that you're gonna be
 

5411
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:04,950
the questions that you're gonna be
tested on that's important because

5412
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:04,960
tested on that's important because
 

5413
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,550
tested on that's important because
otherwise what you're doing

5414
01:35:06,550 --> 01:35:06,560
otherwise what you're doing
 

5415
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:08,229
otherwise what you're doing
is not exhibiting intelligence what

5416
01:35:08,229 --> 01:35:08,239
is not exhibiting intelligence what
 

5417
01:35:08,239 --> 01:35:10,550
is not exhibiting intelligence what
you're doing is just retrieving

5418
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:10,560
you're doing is just retrieving
 

5419
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:12,709
you're doing is just retrieving
uh what you've been exposed before it's

5420
01:35:12,709 --> 01:35:12,719
uh what you've been exposed before it's
 

5421
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:14,070
uh what you've been exposed before it's
it's the same thing as deep learning

5422
01:35:14,070 --> 01:35:14,080
it's the same thing as deep learning
 

5423
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:15,910
it's the same thing as deep learning
model if you train a deep learning model

5424
01:35:15,910 --> 01:35:15,920
model if you train a deep learning model
 

5425
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:16,470
model if you train a deep learning model
on

5426
01:35:16,470 --> 01:35:16,480
on
 

5427
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:19,270
on
uh all the possible answers then it will

5428
01:35:19,270 --> 01:35:19,280
uh all the possible answers then it will
 

5429
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:21,189
uh all the possible answers then it will
ace your test in the same way that

5430
01:35:21,189 --> 01:35:21,199
ace your test in the same way that
 

5431
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:24,310
ace your test in the same way that
uh um you know uh as

5432
01:35:24,310 --> 01:35:24,320
uh um you know uh as
 

5433
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:27,270
uh um you know uh as
a stupid student uh can still ace the

5434
01:35:27,270 --> 01:35:27,280
a stupid student uh can still ace the
 

5435
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:27,990
a stupid student uh can still ace the
test

5436
01:35:27,990 --> 01:35:28,000
test
 

5437
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,910
test
if they cram for it they memorize

5438
01:35:31,910 --> 01:35:31,920
if they cram for it they memorize
 

5439
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:34,470
if they cram for it they memorize
you know 100 different possible mock

5440
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:34,480
you know 100 different possible mock
 

5441
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:36,070
you know 100 different possible mock
exams and then they hope that

5442
01:35:36,070 --> 01:35:36,080
exams and then they hope that
 

5443
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:39,189
exams and then they hope that
the actual exam will be a very simple

5444
01:35:39,189 --> 01:35:39,199
the actual exam will be a very simple
 

5445
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:41,510
the actual exam will be a very simple
interpolation of the mock exams and that

5446
01:35:41,510 --> 01:35:41,520
interpolation of the mock exams and that
 

5447
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:42,790
interpolation of the mock exams and that
student could just be a deep learning

5448
01:35:42,790 --> 01:35:42,800
student could just be a deep learning
 

5449
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:43,830
student could just be a deep learning
model at that point

5450
01:35:43,830 --> 01:35:43,840
model at that point
 

5451
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:46,790
model at that point
but you can actually do that without any

5452
01:35:46,790 --> 01:35:46,800
but you can actually do that without any
 

5453
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:48,310
but you can actually do that without any
understanding of the material and in

5454
01:35:48,310 --> 01:35:48,320
understanding of the material and in
 

5455
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,590
understanding of the material and in
fact many students

5456
01:35:49,590 --> 01:35:49,600
fact many students
 

5457
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:51,990
fact many students
pass the exams in exactly this way and

5458
01:35:51,990 --> 01:35:52,000
pass the exams in exactly this way and
 

5459
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,669
pass the exams in exactly this way and
if you want to avoid that you need an

5460
01:35:53,669 --> 01:35:53,679
if you want to avoid that you need an
 

5461
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:54,950
if you want to avoid that you need an
exam that's

5462
01:35:54,950 --> 01:35:54,960
exam that's
 

5463
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:57,109
exam that's
unlike anything they've seen that really

5464
01:35:57,109 --> 01:35:57,119
unlike anything they've seen that really
 

5465
01:35:57,119 --> 01:35:58,310
unlike anything they've seen that really
probes

5466
01:35:58,310 --> 01:35:58,320
probes
 

5467
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:01,669
probes
their understanding so how do we

5468
01:36:01,669 --> 01:36:01,679
their understanding so how do we
 

5469
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:05,030
their understanding so how do we
design an iq test for machines

5470
01:36:05,030 --> 01:36:05,040
design an iq test for machines
 

5471
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:07,990
design an iq test for machines
and intelligent tests for machines all

5472
01:36:07,990 --> 01:36:08,000
and intelligent tests for machines all
 

5473
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:08,950
and intelligent tests for machines all
right so

5474
01:36:08,950 --> 01:36:08,960
right so
 

5475
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:11,350
right so
in the paper i outline a number of

5476
01:36:11,350 --> 01:36:11,360
in the paper i outline a number of
 

5477
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:12,550
in the paper i outline a number of
requirements

5478
01:36:12,550 --> 01:36:12,560
requirements
 

5479
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:15,350
requirements
that you expect of such a test and in

5480
01:36:15,350 --> 01:36:15,360
that you expect of such a test and in
 

5481
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,870
that you expect of such a test and in
particular we should

5482
01:36:16,870 --> 01:36:16,880
particular we should
 

5483
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:20,790
particular we should
start by acknowledging the priors

5484
01:36:20,790 --> 01:36:20,800
start by acknowledging the priors
 

5485
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:23,669
start by acknowledging the priors
that we expect to be required in order

5486
01:36:23,669 --> 01:36:23,679
that we expect to be required in order
 

5487
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:25,270
that we expect to be required in order
to perform the test

5488
01:36:25,270 --> 01:36:25,280
to perform the test
 

5489
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:26,790
to perform the test
so we should be explicit about the

5490
01:36:26,790 --> 01:36:26,800
so we should be explicit about the
 

5491
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:28,470
so we should be explicit about the
priors right uh

5492
01:36:28,470 --> 01:36:28,480
priors right uh
 

5493
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:31,270
priors right uh
and if the goal is to compare machine

5494
01:36:31,270 --> 01:36:31,280
and if the goal is to compare machine
 

5495
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:32,950
and if the goal is to compare machine
intelligence and human intelligence then

5496
01:36:32,950 --> 01:36:32,960
intelligence and human intelligence then
 

5497
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:34,390
intelligence and human intelligence then
we should assume

5498
01:36:34,390 --> 01:36:34,400
we should assume
 

5499
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:38,229
we should assume
uh human cognitive bias right and

5500
01:36:38,229 --> 01:36:38,239
uh human cognitive bias right and
 

5501
01:36:38,239 --> 01:36:41,189
uh human cognitive bias right and
secondly we should make sure that we are

5502
01:36:41,189 --> 01:36:41,199
secondly we should make sure that we are
 

5503
01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:42,070
secondly we should make sure that we are
testing

5504
01:36:42,070 --> 01:36:42,080
testing
 

5505
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:45,109
testing
for skilled acquisition ability uh skill

5506
01:36:45,109 --> 01:36:45,119
for skilled acquisition ability uh skill
 

5507
01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:46,950
for skilled acquisition ability uh skill
acquisition efficiency in particular and

5508
01:36:46,950 --> 01:36:46,960
acquisition efficiency in particular and
 

5509
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:48,550
acquisition efficiency in particular and
not for skill itself

5510
01:36:48,550 --> 01:36:48,560
not for skill itself
 

5511
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:51,590
not for skill itself
meaning that every task featured in your

5512
01:36:51,590 --> 01:36:51,600
meaning that every task featured in your
 

5513
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:52,470
meaning that every task featured in your
test should be

5514
01:36:52,470 --> 01:36:52,480
test should be
 

5515
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,550
test should be
novel and should not be something that

5516
01:36:54,550 --> 01:36:54,560
novel and should not be something that
 

5517
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:55,990
novel and should not be something that
you can anticipate

5518
01:36:55,990 --> 01:36:56,000
you can anticipate
 

5519
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,430
you can anticipate
so for instance it should not be

5520
01:36:57,430 --> 01:36:57,440
so for instance it should not be
 

5521
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:59,030
so for instance it should not be
possible to

5522
01:36:59,030 --> 01:36:59,040
possible to
 

5523
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:00,950
possible to
brute force the space of possible

5524
01:37:00,950 --> 01:37:00,960
brute force the space of possible
 

5525
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:02,790
brute force the space of possible
questions right

5526
01:37:02,790 --> 01:37:02,800
questions right
 

5527
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:05,109
questions right
to pre-generate every possible question

5528
01:37:05,109 --> 01:37:05,119
to pre-generate every possible question
 

5529
01:37:05,119 --> 01:37:06,950
to pre-generate every possible question
and the answer

5530
01:37:06,950 --> 01:37:06,960
and the answer
 

5531
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:09,750
and the answer
so it should be tasks that cannot be

5532
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:09,760
so it should be tasks that cannot be
 

5533
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:10,790
so it should be tasks that cannot be
anticipated

5534
01:37:10,790 --> 01:37:10,800
anticipated
 

5535
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:13,189
anticipated
not just by the system itself but by the

5536
01:37:13,189 --> 01:37:13,199
not just by the system itself but by the
 

5537
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:13,910
not just by the system itself but by the
creators

5538
01:37:13,910 --> 01:37:13,920
creators
 

5539
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:16,870
creators
of the system right yeah you know what's

5540
01:37:16,870 --> 01:37:16,880
of the system right yeah you know what's
 

5541
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:19,030
of the system right yeah you know what's
fascinating i mean one of my favorite

5542
01:37:19,030 --> 01:37:19,040
fascinating i mean one of my favorite
 

5543
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:20,070
fascinating i mean one of my favorite
aspects of

5544
01:37:20,070 --> 01:37:20,080
aspects of
 

5545
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:21,750
aspects of
the paper and the work you do with the

5546
01:37:21,750 --> 01:37:21,760
the paper and the work you do with the
 

5547
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:24,390
the paper and the work you do with the
arc challenge is

5548
01:37:24,390 --> 01:37:24,400
arc challenge is
 

5549
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:26,390
arc challenge is
the the process of making priors

5550
01:37:26,390 --> 01:37:26,400
the the process of making priors
 

5551
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:28,950
the the process of making priors
explicit

5552
01:37:28,950 --> 01:37:28,960
explicit
 

5553
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:32,070
explicit
just even that act alone is a really

5554
01:37:32,070 --> 01:37:32,080
just even that act alone is a really
 

5555
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:33,430
just even that act alone is a really
powerful one

5556
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:33,440
powerful one
 

5557
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:37,750
powerful one
of like what are it's a

5558
01:37:37,750 --> 01:37:37,760
of like what are it's a
 

5559
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:39,750
of like what are it's a
it's a really powerful question ask of

5560
01:37:39,750 --> 01:37:39,760
it's a really powerful question ask of
 

5561
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:41,590
it's a really powerful question ask of
us humans what are the priors that we

5562
01:37:41,590 --> 01:37:41,600
us humans what are the priors that we
 

5563
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:44,149
us humans what are the priors that we
bring to the table

5564
01:37:44,149 --> 01:37:44,159
bring to the table
 

5565
01:37:44,159 --> 01:37:46,070
bring to the table
so the the next step is like once you

5566
01:37:46,070 --> 01:37:46,080
so the the next step is like once you
 

5567
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,870
so the the next step is like once you
have those priors how do you use them to

5568
01:37:48,870 --> 01:37:48,880
have those priors how do you use them to
 

5569
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:50,790
have those priors how do you use them to
solve a novel task but like just even

5570
01:37:50,790 --> 01:37:50,800
solve a novel task but like just even
 

5571
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,870
solve a novel task but like just even
making the prize explicit

5572
01:37:52,870 --> 01:37:52,880
making the prize explicit
 

5573
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:54,629
making the prize explicit
is a really difficult and really

5574
01:37:54,629 --> 01:37:54,639
is a really difficult and really
 

5575
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:56,390
is a really difficult and really
powerful step

5576
01:37:56,390 --> 01:37:56,400
powerful step
 

5577
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:59,189
powerful step
and that's like visually beautiful and

5578
01:37:59,189 --> 01:37:59,199
and that's like visually beautiful and
 

5579
01:37:59,199 --> 01:38:00,950
and that's like visually beautiful and
conceptually philosophically beautiful

5580
01:38:00,950 --> 01:38:00,960
conceptually philosophically beautiful
 

5581
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:02,790
conceptually philosophically beautiful
part of the work you did

5582
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:02,800
part of the work you did
 

5583
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:05,990
part of the work you did
with uh and i guess continue to do uh

5584
01:38:05,990 --> 01:38:06,000
with uh and i guess continue to do uh
 

5585
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,350
with uh and i guess continue to do uh
probably with the with the paper and the

5586
01:38:07,350 --> 01:38:07,360
probably with the with the paper and the
 

5587
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:08,390
probably with the with the paper and the
arc challenge

5588
01:38:08,390 --> 01:38:08,400
arc challenge
 

5589
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:10,629
arc challenge
can you talk about some of the priors

5590
01:38:10,629 --> 01:38:10,639
can you talk about some of the priors
 

5591
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:12,310
can you talk about some of the priors
that we're talking about here

5592
01:38:12,310 --> 01:38:12,320
that we're talking about here
 

5593
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:14,950
that we're talking about here
yes so a researcher has done a lot of

5594
01:38:14,950 --> 01:38:14,960
yes so a researcher has done a lot of
 

5595
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:15,990
yes so a researcher has done a lot of
work on

5596
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:16,000
work on
 

5597
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,950
work on
what exactly uh um are the knowledge

5598
01:38:18,950 --> 01:38:18,960
what exactly uh um are the knowledge
 

5599
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:19,990
what exactly uh um are the knowledge
priors that

5600
01:38:19,990 --> 01:38:20,000
priors that
 

5601
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,669
priors that
that are innate to humans is elizabeth

spelkie from harvard so

5604
01:38:27,109 --> 01:38:27,119
spelkie from harvard so
 

5605
01:38:27,119 --> 01:38:29,590
spelkie from harvard so
she developed the core knowledge uh

5606
01:38:29,590 --> 01:38:29,600
she developed the core knowledge uh
 

5607
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:30,629
she developed the core knowledge uh
theory

5608
01:38:30,629 --> 01:38:30,639
theory
 

5609
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:33,669
theory
which uh outlines four different

5610
01:38:33,669 --> 01:38:33,679
which uh outlines four different
 

5611
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:37,109
which uh outlines four different
uh core knowledge systems uh so systems

5612
01:38:37,109 --> 01:38:37,119
uh core knowledge systems uh so systems
 

5613
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:38,310
uh core knowledge systems uh so systems
of knowledge that we are

5614
01:38:38,310 --> 01:38:38,320
of knowledge that we are
 

5615
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:41,430
of knowledge that we are
basically either born with or that we

5616
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:41,440
basically either born with or that we
 

5617
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:42,790
basically either born with or that we
are

5618
01:38:42,790 --> 01:38:42,800
are
 

5619
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:45,910
are
hardwired to acquire very early on

5620
01:38:45,910 --> 01:38:45,920
hardwired to acquire very early on
 

5621
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:48,550
hardwired to acquire very early on
in our development and there's no uh

5622
01:38:48,550 --> 01:38:48,560
in our development and there's no uh
 

5623
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:50,070
in our development and there's no uh
there's no strong

5624
01:38:50,070 --> 01:38:50,080
there's no strong
 

5625
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:52,310
there's no strong
um distinction between the two like if

5626
01:38:52,310 --> 01:38:52,320
um distinction between the two like if
 

5627
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,070
um distinction between the two like if
you are

5628
01:38:54,070 --> 01:38:54,080
you are
 

5629
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:58,310
you are
um primed to acquire as a

5630
01:38:58,310 --> 01:38:58,320
um primed to acquire as a
 

5631
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:00,550
um primed to acquire as a
certain type of knowledge uh in just a

5632
01:39:00,550 --> 01:39:00,560
certain type of knowledge uh in just a
 

5633
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,390
certain type of knowledge uh in just a
few weeks you might as well

5634
01:39:02,390 --> 01:39:02,400
few weeks you might as well
 

5635
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:04,229
few weeks you might as well
just be born with it it's just it's just

5636
01:39:04,229 --> 01:39:04,239
just be born with it it's just it's just
 

5637
01:39:04,239 --> 01:39:06,310
just be born with it it's just it's just
part of who you are

5638
01:39:06,310 --> 01:39:06,320
part of who you are
 

5639
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:07,590
part of who you are
and so there are there are four

5640
01:39:07,590 --> 01:39:07,600
and so there are there are four
 

5641
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:09,590
and so there are there are four
different core knowledge systems like

5642
01:39:09,590 --> 01:39:09,600
different core knowledge systems like
 

5643
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:10,870
different core knowledge systems like
the first one

5644
01:39:10,870 --> 01:39:10,880
the first one
 

5645
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:14,229
the first one
is the notion of objectness and

5646
01:39:14,229 --> 01:39:14,239
is the notion of objectness and
 

5647
01:39:14,239 --> 01:39:18,070
is the notion of objectness and
a basic physics like you recognize that

5648
01:39:18,070 --> 01:39:18,080
a basic physics like you recognize that
 

5649
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:21,430
a basic physics like you recognize that
um something that moves uh currently for

5650
01:39:21,430 --> 01:39:21,440
um something that moves uh currently for
 

5651
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:23,189
um something that moves uh currently for
instance is an object

5652
01:39:23,189 --> 01:39:23,199
instance is an object
 

5653
01:39:23,199 --> 01:39:27,109
instance is an object
so we intuitively naturally innately

5654
01:39:27,109 --> 01:39:27,119
so we intuitively naturally innately
 

5655
01:39:27,119 --> 01:39:29,669
so we intuitively naturally innately
divide the world into objects based on

5656
01:39:29,669 --> 01:39:29,679
divide the world into objects based on
 

5657
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:30,470
divide the world into objects based on
this notion of

5658
01:39:30,470 --> 01:39:30,480
this notion of
 

5659
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:33,510
this notion of
coherence physical currents and in terms

5660
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:33,520
coherence physical currents and in terms
 

5661
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:35,189
coherence physical currents and in terms
of elementary physics there's the

5662
01:39:35,189 --> 01:39:35,199
of elementary physics there's the
 

5663
01:39:35,199 --> 01:39:38,390
of elementary physics there's the
the fact that uh you know objects

5664
01:39:38,390 --> 01:39:38,400
the fact that uh you know objects
 

5665
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:41,590
the fact that uh you know objects
can bump against each other

5666
01:39:41,590 --> 01:39:41,600
can bump against each other
 

5667
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:44,149
can bump against each other
and the fact that they can occlude each

5668
01:39:44,149 --> 01:39:44,159
and the fact that they can occlude each
 

5669
01:39:44,159 --> 01:39:45,510
and the fact that they can occlude each
other so these are

5670
01:39:45,510 --> 01:39:45,520
other so these are
 

5671
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:48,149
other so these are
things that we are essentially born with

5672
01:39:48,149 --> 01:39:48,159
things that we are essentially born with
 

5673
01:39:48,159 --> 01:39:49,750
things that we are essentially born with
or at least that we are

5674
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:49,760
or at least that we are
 

5675
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:52,470
or at least that we are
going to be acquiring extremely early

5676
01:39:52,470 --> 01:39:52,480
going to be acquiring extremely early
 

5677
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:53,510
going to be acquiring extremely early
because really

5678
01:39:53,510 --> 01:39:53,520
because really
 

5679
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:56,470
because really
hard wire to acquire them so a bunch of

5680
01:39:56,470 --> 01:39:56,480
hard wire to acquire them so a bunch of
 

5681
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:57,109
hard wire to acquire them so a bunch of
points

5682
01:39:57,109 --> 01:39:57,119
points
 

5683
01:39:57,119 --> 01:40:00,950
points
pixels that move together on objects

5684
01:40:00,950 --> 01:40:00,960
pixels that move together on objects
 

5685
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:05,109
pixels that move together on objects
are partly the same object yes i mean

5686
01:40:05,109 --> 01:40:05,119
are partly the same object yes i mean
 

5687
01:40:05,119 --> 01:40:08,390
are partly the same object yes i mean
i mean that like i don't i don't smoke

5688
01:40:08,390 --> 01:40:08,400
i mean that like i don't i don't smoke
 

5689
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:09,510
i mean that like i don't i don't smoke
weed but

5690
01:40:09,510 --> 01:40:09,520
weed but
 

5691
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:12,310
weed but
if i did that's something i could sit

5692
01:40:12,310 --> 01:40:12,320
if i did that's something i could sit
 

5693
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:14,070
if i did that's something i could sit
like all night and just like think about

5694
01:40:14,070 --> 01:40:14,080
like all night and just like think about
 

5695
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:15,030
like all night and just like think about
i remember right

5696
01:40:15,030 --> 01:40:15,040
i remember right
 

5697
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:18,070
i remember right
in your paper just object-ness i wasn't

5698
01:40:18,070 --> 01:40:18,080
in your paper just object-ness i wasn't
 

5699
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:21,189
in your paper just object-ness i wasn't
self-aware i guess of how that

5700
01:40:21,189 --> 01:40:21,199
self-aware i guess of how that
 

5701
01:40:21,199 --> 01:40:23,350
self-aware i guess of how that
particular prior

5702
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:23,360
particular prior
 

5703
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:26,870
particular prior
that that's such a fascinating prior

5704
01:40:26,870 --> 01:40:26,880
that that's such a fascinating prior
 

5705
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:29,510
that that's such a fascinating prior
that like and that's that's the most

5706
01:40:29,510 --> 01:40:29,520
that like and that's that's the most
 

5707
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:30,790
that like and that's that's the most
basic one but

5708
01:40:30,790 --> 01:40:30,800
basic one but
 

5709
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:34,550
basic one but
yes just identity just yeah object yes

5710
01:40:34,550 --> 01:40:34,560
yes just identity just yeah object yes
 

5711
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:37,590
yes just identity just yeah object yes
it's it's very basic i suppose but

5712
01:40:37,590 --> 01:40:37,600
it's it's very basic i suppose but
 

5713
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:39,830
it's it's very basic i suppose but
it's so fundamental is this phenomenal

5714
01:40:39,830 --> 01:40:39,840
it's so fundamental is this phenomenal
 

5715
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:41,350
it's so fundamental is this phenomenal
team and cognition

5716
01:40:41,350 --> 01:40:41,360
team and cognition
 

5717
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:44,229
team and cognition
yeah and uh the second prior that's also

5718
01:40:44,229 --> 01:40:44,239
yeah and uh the second prior that's also
 

5719
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:45,430
yeah and uh the second prior that's also
fundamental is

5720
01:40:45,430 --> 01:40:45,440
fundamental is
 

5721
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:48,149
fundamental is
agent-ness which is not a real world a

5722
01:40:48,149 --> 01:40:48,159
agent-ness which is not a real world a
 

5723
01:40:48,159 --> 01:40:48,870
agent-ness which is not a real world a
real world

5724
01:40:48,870 --> 01:40:48,880
real world
 

5725
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:51,910
real world
but so agentness the fact that some of

5726
01:40:51,910 --> 01:40:51,920
but so agentness the fact that some of
 

5727
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:52,870
but so agentness the fact that some of
these objects

5728
01:40:52,870 --> 01:40:52,880
these objects
 

5729
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:55,270
these objects
uh that you that you segment your

5730
01:40:55,270 --> 01:40:55,280
uh that you that you segment your
 

5731
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:56,550
uh that you that you segment your
environment into

5732
01:40:56,550 --> 01:40:56,560
environment into
 

5733
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:58,950
environment into
some of these objects are agents so

5734
01:40:58,950 --> 01:40:58,960
some of these objects are agents so
 

5735
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:00,310
some of these objects are agents so
what's an agent

5736
01:41:00,310 --> 01:41:00,320
what's an agent
 

5737
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:02,709
what's an agent
it's uh basically it's an object that

5738
01:41:02,709 --> 01:41:02,719
it's uh basically it's an object that
 

5739
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:03,510
it's uh basically it's an object that
has

5740
01:41:03,510 --> 01:41:03,520
has
 

5741
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:07,430
has
goals um so that has what that has goals

5742
01:41:07,430 --> 01:41:07,440
goals um so that has what that has goals
 

5743
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:09,590
goals um so that has what that has goals
this this capable of person goals so for

5744
01:41:09,590 --> 01:41:09,600
this this capable of person goals so for
 

5745
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:10,790
this this capable of person goals so for
instance if you see

5746
01:41:10,790 --> 01:41:10,800
instance if you see
 

5747
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:13,830
instance if you see
two dots uh moving in in a

5748
01:41:13,830 --> 01:41:13,840
two dots uh moving in in a
 

5749
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:16,629
two dots uh moving in in a
roughly synchronized fashion you will

5750
01:41:16,629 --> 01:41:16,639
roughly synchronized fashion you will
 

5751
01:41:16,639 --> 01:41:17,590
roughly synchronized fashion you will
intuitively

5752
01:41:17,590 --> 01:41:17,600
intuitively
 

5753
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:20,870
intuitively
infer that one of the dots is pursuing

5754
01:41:20,870 --> 01:41:20,880
infer that one of the dots is pursuing
 

5755
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:21,590
infer that one of the dots is pursuing
the other

5756
01:41:21,590 --> 01:41:21,600
the other
 

5757
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:24,870
the other
so that one of the dots is

5758
01:41:24,870 --> 01:41:24,880
so that one of the dots is
 

5759
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:27,270
so that one of the dots is
uh and and one of the dots is an agent

5760
01:41:27,270 --> 01:41:27,280
uh and and one of the dots is an agent
 

5761
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:29,270
uh and and one of the dots is an agent
and its goal is to avoid the other dot

5762
01:41:29,270 --> 01:41:29,280
and its goal is to avoid the other dot
 

5763
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:30,870
and its goal is to avoid the other dot
and one of the dots the other dot

5764
01:41:30,870 --> 01:41:30,880
and one of the dots the other dot
 

5765
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:33,590
and one of the dots the other dot
is also an asian and its goal is to

5766
01:41:33,590 --> 01:41:33,600
is also an asian and its goal is to
 

5767
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:34,470
is also an asian and its goal is to
catch

5768
01:41:34,470 --> 01:41:34,480
catch
 

5769
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:37,590
catch
the first start pelkey has shown that

01:41:37,590 --> 01:41:37,600
the first start pelkey has shown that
 

5771
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:40,470
the first start pelkey has shown that
babies you know as young as three months

5772
01:41:40,470 --> 01:41:40,480

identify
 

5775
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:45,189
identify
uh agentness and goal directedness

5776
01:41:45,189 --> 01:41:45,199
uh agentness and goal directedness
 

5777
01:41:45,199 --> 01:41:48,310
uh agentness and goal directedness
in their environment another prior is

5778
01:41:48,310 --> 01:41:48,320
in their environment another prior is
 

5779
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:52,070
in their environment another prior is
basic you know geometry and topology

5780
01:41:52,070 --> 01:41:52,080
basic you know geometry and topology
 

5781
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:54,229
basic you know geometry and topology
like the notion of distance the ability

5782
01:41:54,229 --> 01:41:54,239
like the notion of distance the ability
 

5783
01:41:54,239 --> 01:41:56,390
like the notion of distance the ability
to navigate

5784
01:41:56,390 --> 01:41:56,400
to navigate
 

5785
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:57,830
to navigate
in your environment and so on this is

5786
01:41:57,830 --> 01:41:57,840
in your environment and so on this is
 

5787
01:41:57,840 --> 01:41:59,510
in your environment and so on this is
something that is fundamentally

5788
01:41:59,510 --> 01:41:59,520
something that is fundamentally
 

5789
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:02,629
something that is fundamentally
hardwired into our brain

5790
01:42:02,629 --> 01:42:02,639
hardwired into our brain
 

5791
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:05,750
hardwired into our brain
it's in fact backed by very specific

5792
01:42:05,750 --> 01:42:05,760
it's in fact backed by very specific
 

5793
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:07,030
it's in fact backed by very specific
neural mechanisms

5794
01:42:07,030 --> 01:42:07,040
neural mechanisms
 

5795
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:09,990
neural mechanisms
like for instance grid cells and plate

5796
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:10,000
like for instance grid cells and plate
 

5797
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:10,709
like for instance grid cells and plate
cells

5798
01:42:10,709 --> 01:42:10,719
cells
 

5799
01:42:10,719 --> 01:42:14,149
cells
so it's it's something that's literally

5800
01:42:14,149 --> 01:42:14,159
so it's it's something that's literally
 

5801
01:42:14,159 --> 01:42:17,510
so it's it's something that's literally
hard coded at the at the new level

5802
01:42:17,510 --> 01:42:17,520
hard coded at the at the new level
 

5803
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:20,149
hard coded at the at the new level
uh you know you know hypocampus and the

5804
01:42:20,149 --> 01:42:20,159
uh you know you know hypocampus and the
 

5805
01:42:20,159 --> 01:42:21,430
uh you know you know hypocampus and the
last prior

5806
01:42:21,430 --> 01:42:21,440
last prior
 

5807
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:23,750
last prior
would be the notion of numbers like

5808
01:42:23,750 --> 01:42:23,760
would be the notion of numbers like
 

5809
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:25,590
would be the notion of numbers like
numbers are not actually cultural

5810
01:42:25,590 --> 01:42:25,600
numbers are not actually cultural
 

5811
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:26,390
numbers are not actually cultural
constructs

5812
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:26,400
constructs
 

5813
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:29,990
constructs
we are intuitively innately able

5814
01:42:29,990 --> 01:42:30,000
we are intuitively innately able
 

5815
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:33,270
we are intuitively innately able
to do some basic counting and to compare

5816
01:42:33,270 --> 01:42:33,280
to do some basic counting and to compare
 

5817
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:34,550
to do some basic counting and to compare
quantities

5818
01:42:34,550 --> 01:42:34,560
quantities
 

5819
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:35,910
quantities
uh so it doesn't mean we can do

5820
01:42:35,910 --> 01:42:35,920
uh so it doesn't mean we can do
 

5821
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:37,750
uh so it doesn't mean we can do
arbitrary arithmetic

5822
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:37,760
arbitrary arithmetic
 

5823
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:39,750
arbitrary arithmetic
uh uh counting the actual accounting

5824
01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:39,760
uh uh counting the actual accounting
 

5825
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:42,149
uh uh counting the actual accounting
scanning like counting one two three ish

5826
01:42:42,149 --> 01:42:42,159
scanning like counting one two three ish
 

5827
01:42:42,159 --> 01:42:43,030
scanning like counting one two three ish
then maybe

5828
01:42:43,030 --> 01:42:43,040
then maybe
 

5829
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:45,350
then maybe
more than three uh you can also compare

5830
01:42:45,350 --> 01:42:45,360
more than three uh you can also compare
 

5831
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:46,950
more than three uh you can also compare
quantities if i give you

5832
01:42:46,950 --> 01:42:46,960
quantities if i give you
 

5833
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:49,590
quantities if i give you
uh uh three dots and five dots you can

5834
01:42:49,590 --> 01:42:49,600
uh uh three dots and five dots you can
 

5835
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,390
uh uh three dots and five dots you can
tell the the

5836
01:42:50,390 --> 01:42:50,400
tell the the
 

5837
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:51,910
tell the the
the side with five dots there's more

5838
01:42:51,910 --> 01:42:51,920
the side with five dots there's more
 

5839
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:54,390
the side with five dots there's more
dots uh so this is actually

5840
01:42:54,390 --> 01:42:54,400
dots uh so this is actually
 

5841
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:58,070
dots uh so this is actually
an innate uh prior um so

5842
01:42:58,070 --> 01:42:58,080
an innate uh prior um so
 

5843
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:00,950
an innate uh prior um so
that said the list may not be exhaustive

5844
01:43:00,950 --> 01:43:00,960
that said the list may not be exhaustive
 

5845
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:01,350
that said the list may not be exhaustive
uh

5846
01:43:01,350 --> 01:43:01,360
uh
 

5847
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:07,109
uh
so spelke is still you know pursuing

5848
01:43:07,109 --> 01:43:07,119

 

5849
01:43:07,119 --> 01:43:09,270

the potential existence of new knowledge

5850
01:43:09,270 --> 01:43:09,280
the potential existence of new knowledge
 

5851
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:10,550
the potential existence of new knowledge
systems for instance

5852
01:43:10,550 --> 01:43:10,560
systems for instance
 

5853
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:13,270
systems for instance
uh knowledge systems that would deal

5854
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:13,280
uh knowledge systems that would deal
 

5855
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:14,470
uh knowledge systems that would deal
with social

5856
01:43:14,470 --> 01:43:14,480
with social
 

5857
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:18,790
with social
uh relationships yeah yeah i mean

5858
01:43:18,790 --> 01:43:18,800
uh relationships yeah yeah i mean
 

5859
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:20,149
uh relationships yeah yeah i mean
which is which is much much less

5860
01:43:20,149 --> 01:43:20,159
which is which is much much less
 

5861
01:43:20,159 --> 01:43:21,990
which is which is much much less
relevant uh uh

5862
01:43:21,990 --> 01:43:22,000
relevant uh uh
 

5863
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,310
relevant uh uh
to something like arc or iq testing

5864
01:43:24,310 --> 01:43:24,320
to something like arc or iq testing
 

5865
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:25,830
to something like arc or iq testing
right so there could be stuff

5866
01:43:25,830 --> 01:43:25,840
right so there could be stuff
 

5867
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:28,950
right so there could be stuff
that's uh like like you said rotation

5868
01:43:28,950 --> 01:43:28,960
that's uh like like you said rotation
 

5869
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:31,430
that's uh like like you said rotation
symmetry is really interesting it's very

5870
01:43:31,430 --> 01:43:31,440
symmetry is really interesting it's very
 

5871
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:32,870
symmetry is really interesting it's very
likely that there is

5872
01:43:32,870 --> 01:43:32,880
likely that there is
 

5873
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:35,270
likely that there is
uh speaking about rotation that there is

5874
01:43:35,270 --> 01:43:35,280
uh speaking about rotation that there is
 

5875
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:37,109
uh speaking about rotation that there is
uh in the brain

5876
01:43:37,109 --> 01:43:37,119
uh in the brain
 

5877
01:43:37,119 --> 01:43:39,590
uh in the brain
a hard-coded system that is capable of

5878
01:43:39,590 --> 01:43:39,600
a hard-coded system that is capable of
 

5879
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:41,270
a hard-coded system that is capable of
performing rotations

5880
01:43:41,270 --> 01:43:41,280
performing rotations
 

5881
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:44,550
performing rotations
uh one one famous experiment uh that

5882
01:43:44,550 --> 01:43:44,560
uh one one famous experiment uh that
 

5883
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:45,590
uh one one famous experiment uh that
people did in the

5884
01:43:45,590 --> 01:43:45,600
people did in the
 

5885
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:48,070
people did in the
uh i don't remember who it was exactly

5886
01:43:48,070 --> 01:43:48,080
uh i don't remember who it was exactly
 

5887
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:49,270
uh i don't remember who it was exactly
but in the in

5888
01:43:49,270 --> 01:43:49,280
but in the in
 

5889
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:52,310
but in the in
the 70s was that

5890
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:52,320
the 70s was that
 

5891
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:54,390
the 70s was that
people found that if you asked people if

5892
01:43:54,390 --> 01:43:54,400
people found that if you asked people if
 

5893
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:55,510
people found that if you asked people if
you give them

5894
01:43:55,510 --> 01:43:55,520
you give them
 

5895
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:58,790
you give them
uh two different shapes and one of the

5896
01:43:58,790 --> 01:43:58,800
uh two different shapes and one of the
 

5897
01:43:58,800 --> 01:43:59,350
uh two different shapes and one of the
shapes

5898
01:43:59,350 --> 01:43:59,360
shapes

01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:02,070
shapes
is a rotated version of the first shape

5900
01:44:02,070 --> 01:44:02,080
is a rotated version of the first shape
 

5901
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:03,270
is a rotated version of the first shape
and you ask them

5902
01:44:03,270 --> 01:44:03,280
and you ask them
 

5903
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:05,109
and you ask them
is is that shape a related version of

5904
01:44:05,109 --> 01:44:05,119
is is that shape a related version of
 

5905
01:44:05,119 --> 01:44:06,950
is is that shape a related version of
first step or not

5906
01:44:06,950 --> 01:44:06,960
first step or not
 

5907
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:09,750
first step or not
what you see is that the time it takes

5908
01:44:09,750 --> 01:44:09,760
what you see is that the time it takes
 

5909
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:11,109
what you see is that the time it takes
people to answer

5910
01:44:11,109 --> 01:44:11,119
people to answer
 

5911
01:44:11,119 --> 01:44:14,470
people to answer
is linearly proportional right

5912
01:44:14,470 --> 01:44:14,480
is linearly proportional right
 

5913
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:16,790
is linearly proportional right
to the angle of rotation so it's almost

5914
01:44:16,790 --> 01:44:16,800
to the angle of rotation so it's almost
 

5915
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:19,590
to the angle of rotation so it's almost
like you have in somewhere in your brain

5916
01:44:19,590 --> 01:44:19,600
like you have in somewhere in your brain
 

5917
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:23,910
like you have in somewhere in your brain
like a turntable um with a fixed speed

5918
01:44:23,910 --> 01:44:23,920
like a turntable um with a fixed speed
 

5919
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:25,830
like a turntable um with a fixed speed
and if you want to know if two two

5920
01:44:25,830 --> 01:44:25,840
and if you want to know if two two
 

5921
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:27,189
and if you want to know if two two
objects uh

5922
01:44:27,189 --> 01:44:27,199
objects uh
 

5923
01:44:27,199 --> 01:44:29,189
objects uh
uh are rotated version of each other you

5924
01:44:29,189 --> 01:44:29,199
uh are rotated version of each other you
 

5925
01:44:29,199 --> 01:44:31,590
uh are rotated version of each other you
put the object on the turntable

5926
01:44:31,590 --> 01:44:31,600
put the object on the turntable
 

5927
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:34,709
put the object on the turntable
you let it move around a little bit

5928
01:44:34,709 --> 01:44:34,719
you let it move around a little bit
 

5929
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:36,229
you let it move around a little bit
and then you and then you stop when you

5930
01:44:36,229 --> 01:44:36,239
and then you and then you stop when you
 

5931
01:44:36,239 --> 01:44:38,629
and then you and then you stop when you
have a match and and that that's really

5932
01:44:38,629 --> 01:44:38,639
have a match and and that that's really
 

5933
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:40,070
have a match and and that that's really
interesting

5934
01:44:40,070 --> 01:44:40,080
interesting
 

5935
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:43,669
interesting
so what's the arc challenge so

5936
01:44:43,669 --> 01:44:43,679
so what's the arc challenge so
 

5937
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:46,229
so what's the arc challenge so
in in the paper outline you know all

5938
01:44:46,229 --> 01:44:46,239
in in the paper outline you know all
 

5939
01:44:46,239 --> 01:44:47,350
in in the paper outline you know all
these principles

5940
01:44:47,350 --> 01:44:47,360
these principles
 

5941
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:49,990
these principles
that a good test of machine intelligence

5942
01:44:49,990 --> 01:44:50,000
that a good test of machine intelligence
 

5943
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,830
that a good test of machine intelligence
and humanitarian should follow

5944
01:44:51,830 --> 01:44:51,840
and humanitarian should follow
 

5945
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:55,189
and humanitarian should follow
and the arc challenge is one attempt

5946
01:44:55,189 --> 01:44:55,199
and the arc challenge is one attempt
 

5947
01:44:55,199 --> 01:44:57,669
and the arc challenge is one attempt
to embody as many of these principles as

5948
01:44:57,669 --> 01:44:57,679
to embody as many of these principles as
 

5949
01:44:57,679 --> 01:44:58,390
to embody as many of these principles as
possible

5950
01:44:58,390 --> 01:44:58,400
possible
 

5951
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:01,270
possible
so i don't think it's it's anywhere near

5952
01:45:01,270 --> 01:45:01,280
so i don't think it's it's anywhere near
 

5953
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:03,270
so i don't think it's it's anywhere near
a perfect attempt

5954
01:45:03,270 --> 01:45:03,280
a perfect attempt
 

5955
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:05,430
a perfect attempt
right it does not actually follow every

5956
01:45:05,430 --> 01:45:05,440
right it does not actually follow every
 

5957
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:06,550
right it does not actually follow every
principle but

5958
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:06,560
principle but
 

5959
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:09,189
principle but
it is what i was able to do given the

5960
01:45:09,189 --> 01:45:09,199
it is what i was able to do given the
 

5961
01:45:09,199 --> 01:45:10,629
it is what i was able to do given the
given the constraints

5962
01:45:10,629 --> 01:45:10,639
given the constraints
 

5963
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:14,229
given the constraints
so the format of arc is very similar to

5964
01:45:14,229 --> 01:45:14,239
so the format of arc is very similar to
 

5965
01:45:14,239 --> 01:45:15,990
so the format of arc is very similar to

yeah ravens privacy mattresses i mean
if you've done like you test in the past

5972
01:45:22,709 --> 01:45:22,719
if you've done like you test in the past
 

5973
01:45:22,719 --> 01:45:24,149
if you've done like you test in the past
you know where that is probably

5974
01:45:24,149 --> 01:45:24,159
you know where that is probably
 

5975
01:45:24,159 --> 01:45:25,510
you know where that is probably
at least you've seen it even if you

5976
01:45:25,510 --> 01:45:25,520
at least you've seen it even if you
 

5977
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:27,750
at least you've seen it even if you
don't know what it's called and

5978
01:45:27,750 --> 01:45:27,760
don't know what it's called and
 

5979
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:31,270
don't know what it's called and
so um you have a set of uh tasks

5980
01:45:31,270 --> 01:45:31,280
so um you have a set of uh tasks
 

5981
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:32,709
so um you have a set of uh tasks
that's what they're called and for each

5982
01:45:32,709 --> 01:45:32,719
that's what they're called and for each
 

5983
01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:34,310
that's what they're called and for each
task you have

5984
01:45:34,310 --> 01:45:34,320
task you have
 

5985
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:38,149
task you have
um training data which is a set of

5986
01:45:38,149 --> 01:45:38,159
um training data which is a set of
 

5987
01:45:38,159 --> 01:45:41,830
um training data which is a set of
input and output pairs so i uh an

5988
01:45:41,830 --> 01:45:41,840
input and output pairs so i uh an
 

5989
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:44,870
input and output pairs so i uh an
input or output pair is a grid of colors

5990
01:45:44,870 --> 01:45:44,880
input or output pair is a grid of colors
 

5991
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:46,709
input or output pair is a grid of colors
basically the grid the size of the

5992
01:45:46,709 --> 01:45:46,719
basically the grid the size of the
 

5993
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:47,990
basically the grid the size of the
grades these variables

5994
01:45:47,990 --> 01:45:48,000
grades these variables
 

5995
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,430
grades these variables
is the size of the grid is variable

5996
01:45:51,430 --> 01:45:51,440
is the size of the grid is variable
 

5997
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:54,709
is the size of the grid is variable
and um you're given an input

5998
01:45:54,709 --> 01:45:54,719
and um you're given an input
 

5999
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:56,629
and um you're given an input
and you must transform it into the

6000
01:45:56,629 --> 01:45:56,639
and you must transform it into the
 

6001
01:45:56,639 --> 01:45:57,990
and you must transform it into the
proper outputs

6002
01:45:57,990 --> 01:45:58,000
proper outputs
 

6003
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,870
proper outputs
right and so you're shown a few

6004
01:46:00,870 --> 01:46:00,880
right and so you're shown a few
 

6005
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:01,990
right and so you're shown a few
demonstrations

6006
01:46:01,990 --> 01:46:02,000
demonstrations
 

6007
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,390
demonstrations
of a task in the form of existing input

6008
01:46:04,390 --> 01:46:04,400
of a task in the form of existing input
 

6009
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:06,149
of a task in the form of existing input
output pairs and then you're given a new

6010
01:46:06,149 --> 01:46:06,159
output pairs and then you're given a new
 

6011
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:06,870
output pairs and then you're given a new
input

6012
01:46:06,870 --> 01:46:06,880
input
 

6013
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:10,070
input
and you must provide you must produce

6014
01:46:10,070 --> 01:46:10,080
and you must provide you must produce
 

6015
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:14,950
and you must provide you must produce
the correct output and

6016
01:46:14,950 --> 01:46:14,960
the correct output and
 

6017
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:18,870
the correct output and
the assumptions

generate abstraction

6066
01:47:20,870 --> 01:47:20,880
generate abstraction
 

6067
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:24,470
generate abstraction
in a machine you have to co-evolve the

6079
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:36,149

right and some of the tasks are actually

6080
01:47:36,149 --> 01:47:36,159
right and some of the tasks are actually
 

6081
01:47:36,159 --> 01:47:37,030
right and some of the tasks are actually
designed to

01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:40,070
designed to
to probe uh bits of that theory and

01:47:40,070 --> 01:47:40,080
to probe uh bits of that theory and
 

6085
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:41,750
to probe uh bits of that theory and
there are things that are

01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:43,830
there are things that are
turned out to be very easy for humans to

you learn from the nature of abstraction

6096
01:47:53,350 --> 01:47:53,360
you learn from the nature of abstraction
 

6097
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:57,270
you learn from the nature of abstraction
uh from from designing that

6098
01:47:57,270 --> 01:47:57,280
uh from from designing that
 

6099
01:47:57,280 --> 01:47:59,430
uh from from designing that
like what can you clarify what you mean

6100
01:47:59,430 --> 01:47:59,440
like what can you clarify what you mean
 

6101
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:00,950
like what can you clarify what you mean
one of the things you wanted to try to

6102
01:48:00,950 --> 01:48:00,960
one of the things you wanted to try to
 

6103
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:02,310
one of the things you wanted to try to
understand

6104
01:48:02,310 --> 01:48:02,320
understand
 

6105
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:05,990
understand
was this uh idea of abstraction

6106
01:48:05,990 --> 01:48:06,000
was this uh idea of abstraction
 

6107
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:09,669
was this uh idea of abstraction
yes so clarifying uh my own ideas about

6108
01:48:09,669 --> 01:48:09,679
yes so clarifying uh my own ideas about
 

6109
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:11,350
yes so clarifying uh my own ideas about
abstraction by

6110
01:48:11,350 --> 01:48:11,360
abstraction by
 

6111
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:13,510
abstraction by
forcing myself to produce tasks that

6112
01:48:13,510 --> 01:48:13,520
forcing myself to produce tasks that
 

6113
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:15,109
forcing myself to produce tasks that
would require

6114
01:48:15,109 --> 01:48:15,119
would require
 

6115
01:48:15,119 --> 01:48:17,430
would require
uh the ability to produce that form of

6116
01:48:17,430 --> 01:48:17,440
uh the ability to produce that form of
 

6117
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:19,910
uh the ability to produce that form of
abstraction in order to solve them

6118
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:19,920
abstraction in order to solve them
 

6119
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:22,870
abstraction in order to solve them
got it okay so and by the way just uh i

6120
01:48:22,870 --> 01:48:22,880
got it okay so and by the way just uh i
 

6121
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:24,070
got it okay so and by the way just uh i
mean people should check out i'll

6122
01:48:24,070 --> 01:48:24,080
mean people should check out i'll
 

6123
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:25,590
mean people should check out i'll
probably overlay if you're watching the

6124
01:48:25,590 --> 01:48:25,600
probably overlay if you're watching the
 

6125
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:27,270
probably overlay if you're watching the
video part but the

6126
01:48:27,270 --> 01:48:27,280
video part but the
 

6127
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:30,709
video part but the
the grid input output

6128
01:48:30,709 --> 01:48:30,719
the grid input output
 

6129
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:33,350
the grid input output
with the different colors on the grid

6130
01:48:33,350 --> 01:48:33,360
with the different colors on the grid
 

6131
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:34,870
with the different colors on the grid
and that's it that's i mean it's a very

6132
01:48:34,870 --> 01:48:34,880
and that's it that's i mean it's a very
 

6133
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:36,149
and that's it that's i mean it's a very
simple world

6134
01:48:36,149 --> 01:48:36,159
simple world
 

6135
01:48:36,159 --> 01:48:37,910
simple world
but it's kind of beautiful it's it's

6136
01:48:37,910 --> 01:48:37,920
but it's kind of beautiful it's it's
 

6137
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:39,830
but it's kind of beautiful it's it's
very similar to classic acutes like it's

6138
01:48:39,830 --> 01:48:39,840
very similar to classic acutes like it's
 

6139
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:41,830
very similar to classic acutes like it's
not very original in that sense the main

6140
01:48:41,830 --> 01:48:41,840
not very original in that sense the main
 

6141
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:44,229
not very original in that sense the main
difference with iq tests is that

6142
01:48:44,229 --> 01:48:44,239
difference with iq tests is that
 

6143
01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:46,709
difference with iq tests is that
we make the priors explicit which is not

6144
01:48:46,709 --> 01:48:46,719
we make the priors explicit which is not
 

6145
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:48,390
we make the priors explicit which is not
usually the case in iq test

6146
01:48:48,390 --> 01:48:48,400
usually the case in iq test
 

6147
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:50,229
usually the case in iq test
so you make it explicit that everything

6148
01:48:50,229 --> 01:48:50,239
so you make it explicit that everything
 

6149
01:48:50,239 --> 01:48:51,590
so you make it explicit that everything
should only be built

6150
01:48:51,590 --> 01:48:51,600
should only be built
 

6151
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:54,229
should only be built
out of core knowledge priors i also

6152
01:48:54,229 --> 01:48:54,239
out of core knowledge priors i also
 

6153
01:48:54,239 --> 01:48:55,510
out of core knowledge priors i also
think it's generally

6154
01:48:55,510 --> 01:48:55,520
think it's generally
 

6155
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:58,830
think it's generally
more more diverse than iq tests in

6156
01:48:58,830 --> 01:48:58,840
more more diverse than iq tests in
 

6157
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:00,229
more more diverse than iq tests in
general

6158
01:49:00,229 --> 01:49:00,239
general
 

6159
01:49:00,239 --> 01:49:03,030
general
and it's it perhaps requires a bit more

6160
01:49:03,030 --> 01:49:03,040
and it's it perhaps requires a bit more
 

6161
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:05,189
and it's it perhaps requires a bit more
manual work to produce solutions because

6162
01:49:05,189 --> 01:49:05,199
manual work to produce solutions because
 

6163
01:49:05,199 --> 01:49:07,830
manual work to produce solutions because
you have to to click around on a grid

6164
01:49:07,830 --> 01:49:07,840
you have to to click around on a grid
 

6165
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:09,750
you have to to click around on a grid
for a while sometimes the grades can be

6166
01:49:09,750 --> 01:49:09,760
for a while sometimes the grades can be
 

6167
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,830
for a while sometimes the grades can be
as large as 30 by 30 cells

6168
01:49:11,830 --> 01:49:11,840
as large as 30 by 30 cells
 

6169
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:15,589
as large as 30 by 30 cells
so how did you come up um if you can

6170
01:49:15,589 --> 01:49:15,599
so how did you come up um if you can
 

6171
01:49:15,599 --> 01:49:18,229
so how did you come up um if you can
reveal uh with the questions like what's

6172
01:49:18,229 --> 01:49:18,239
reveal uh with the questions like what's
 

6173
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:19,669
reveal uh with the questions like what's
the process of the questions was it

6174
01:49:19,669 --> 01:49:19,679
the process of the questions was it
 

6175
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:20,629
the process of the questions was it
mostly you

6176
01:49:20,629 --> 01:49:20,639
mostly you
 

6177
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:22,629
mostly you
yeah that came up with the questions

6178
01:49:22,629 --> 01:49:22,639
yeah that came up with the questions
 

6179
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:24,470
yeah that came up with the questions
what uh how difficult is it to come up

6180
01:49:24,470 --> 01:49:24,480
what uh how difficult is it to come up
 

6181
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:25,350
what uh how difficult is it to come up
with a question

6182
01:49:25,350 --> 01:49:25,360
with a question
 

6183
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:29,109
with a question
like is this um scalable

6184
01:49:29,109 --> 01:49:29,119
like is this um scalable
 

6185
01:49:29,119 --> 01:49:31,270
like is this um scalable
to a much larger number if you think you

6186
01:49:31,270 --> 01:49:31,280
to a much larger number if you think you
 

6187
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:32,870
to a much larger number if you think you
know with iq tests you might

6188
01:49:32,870 --> 01:49:32,880
know with iq tests you might
 

6189
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:35,270
know with iq tests you might
not necessarily want to or need it to be

6190
01:49:35,270 --> 01:49:35,280
not necessarily want to or need it to be
 

6191
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:36,310
not necessarily want to or need it to be
scalable

6192
01:49:36,310 --> 01:49:36,320
scalable
 

6193
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:39,510
scalable
with machines it's possible you

6194
01:49:39,510 --> 01:49:39,520
with machines it's possible you
 

6195
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:41,510
with machines it's possible you
could argue that it needs to be scalable

6196
01:49:41,510 --> 01:49:41,520
could argue that it needs to be scalable
 

6197
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:43,990
could argue that it needs to be scalable
so there are a thousand questions

6198
01:49:43,990 --> 01:49:44,000
so there are a thousand questions
 

6199
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,950
so there are a thousand questions
a thousand tasks yes wow including the

6200
01:49:46,950 --> 01:49:46,960
a thousand tasks yes wow including the
 

6201
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:49,030
a thousand tasks yes wow including the
test and the private test set

6202
01:49:49,030 --> 01:49:49,040
test and the private test set
 

6203
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:50,709
test and the private test set
i think it's fairly difficult in the

6204
01:49:50,709 --> 01:49:50,719
i think it's fairly difficult in the
 

6205
01:49:50,719 --> 01:49:52,629
i think it's fairly difficult in the
sense that a big requirement

6206
01:49:52,629 --> 01:49:52,639
sense that a big requirement
 

6207
01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:56,950
sense that a big requirement
is that every task should be novel

6208
01:49:56,950 --> 01:49:56,960
is that every task should be novel
 

6209
01:49:56,960 --> 01:49:59,990
is that every task should be novel
and unique and unpredictable right like

6210
01:49:59,990 --> 01:50:00,000
and unique and unpredictable right like
 

6211
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,990
and unique and unpredictable right like
you don't want to create

6212
01:50:01,990 --> 01:50:02,000
you don't want to create
 

6213
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:05,189
you don't want to create
your your own little world that is

6214
01:50:05,189 --> 01:50:05,199
your your own little world that is
 

6215
01:50:05,199 --> 01:50:07,510
your your own little world that is
uh simple enough that it would be

6216
01:50:07,510 --> 01:50:07,520
uh simple enough that it would be
 

6217
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:08,790
uh simple enough that it would be
possible for a human

6218
01:50:08,790 --> 01:50:08,800
possible for a human
 

6219
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:12,470
possible for a human
to reverse and generate and write down

6220
01:50:12,470 --> 01:50:12,480
to reverse and generate and write down
 

6221
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:15,109
to reverse and generate and write down
an algorithm that could generate every

6222
01:50:15,109 --> 01:50:15,119
an algorithm that could generate every
 

6223
01:50:15,119 --> 01:50:17,109
an algorithm that could generate every
possible arc task and their solution for

6224
01:50:17,109 --> 01:50:17,119
possible arc task and their solution for
 

6225
01:50:17,119 --> 01:50:18,790
possible arc task and their solution for
instance that we completely invalidated

6226
01:50:18,790 --> 01:50:18,800
instance that we completely invalidated
 

6227
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:19,830
instance that we completely invalidated
the test so

6228
01:50:19,830 --> 01:50:19,840
the test so
 

6229
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:21,270
the test so
you're constantly coming up on new stuff

6230
01:50:21,270 --> 01:50:21,280
you're constantly coming up on new stuff
 

6231
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:23,109
you're constantly coming up on new stuff
you need yeah you need a source

6232
01:50:23,109 --> 01:50:23,119
you need yeah you need a source
 

6233
01:50:23,119 --> 01:50:26,149
you need yeah you need a source
of novelty of

6234
01:50:26,149 --> 01:50:26,159
of novelty of
 

6235
01:50:26,159 --> 01:50:28,790
of novelty of
unthinkable novelty and one thing i

6236
01:50:28,790 --> 01:50:28,800
unthinkable novelty and one thing i
 

6237
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:30,149
unthinkable novelty and one thing i
found is that

6238
01:50:30,149 --> 01:50:30,159
found is that
 

6239
01:50:30,159 --> 01:50:33,270
found is that
as a human uh you are not a very good

6240
01:50:33,270 --> 01:50:33,280
as a human uh you are not a very good
 

6241
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:33,910
as a human uh you are not a very good
source

6242
01:50:33,910 --> 01:50:33,920
source
 

6243
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:37,030
source
of uh unthinkable novelty and so you

6244
01:50:37,030 --> 01:50:37,040
of uh unthinkable novelty and so you
 

6245
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:38,070
of uh unthinkable novelty and so you
have to

6246
01:50:38,070 --> 01:50:38,080
have to
 

6247
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:40,790
have to
pace the creation of these tasks quite a

6248
01:50:40,790 --> 01:50:40,800
pace the creation of these tasks quite a
 

6249
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:42,229
pace the creation of these tasks quite a
bit there are only so many

6250
01:50:42,229 --> 01:50:42,239
bit there are only so many
 

6251
01:50:42,239 --> 01:50:43,910
bit there are only so many
unique tasks that you can do in a given

6252
01:50:43,910 --> 01:50:43,920
unique tasks that you can do in a given
 

6253
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:45,510
unique tasks that you can do in a given
day

6254
01:50:45,510 --> 01:50:45,520
day
 

6255
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:47,270
day
so that means coming up with truly

6256
01:50:47,270 --> 01:50:47,280
so that means coming up with truly
 

6257
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:49,109
so that means coming up with truly
original new ideas

6258
01:50:49,109 --> 01:50:49,119
original new ideas
 

6259
01:50:49,119 --> 01:50:52,470
original new ideas
um did psychedelics help you at all i'm

6260
01:50:52,470 --> 01:50:52,480
um did psychedelics help you at all i'm
 

6261
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:53,669
um did psychedelics help you at all i'm
just gonna

6262
01:50:53,669 --> 01:50:53,679
just gonna
 

6263
01:50:53,679 --> 01:50:55,189
just gonna
but i mean that's fascinating to think

6264
01:50:55,189 --> 01:50:55,199
but i mean that's fascinating to think
 

6265
01:50:55,199 --> 01:50:56,870
but i mean that's fascinating to think
about like so you would be like

6266
01:50:56,870 --> 01:50:56,880
about like so you would be like
 

6267
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:59,750
about like so you would be like
walking or something like that are you

6268
01:50:59,750 --> 01:50:59,760
walking or something like that are you
 

6269
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:01,830
walking or something like that are you
constantly thinking of something totally

6270
01:51:01,830 --> 01:51:01,840
constantly thinking of something totally
 

6271
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:02,870
constantly thinking of something totally
new

6272
01:51:02,870 --> 01:51:02,880
new
 

6273
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:06,870
new
yes i mean this is hard

6274
01:51:06,870 --> 01:51:06,880
yes i mean this is hard
 

6275
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:09,990
yes i mean this is hard
this is yeah i i i mean i i'm not saying

6276
01:51:09,990 --> 01:51:10,000
this is yeah i i i mean i i'm not saying
 

6277
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,910
this is yeah i i i mean i i'm not saying
i've done anywhere near a perfect job at

6278
01:51:11,910 --> 01:51:11,920
i've done anywhere near a perfect job at
 

6279
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:13,109
i've done anywhere near a perfect job at
it uh there is some

6280
01:51:13,109 --> 01:51:13,119
it uh there is some
 

6281
01:51:13,119 --> 01:51:15,030
it uh there is some
amount of redundancy and there are many

6282
01:51:15,030 --> 01:51:15,040
amount of redundancy and there are many
 

6283
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:16,629
amount of redundancy and there are many
imperfections in arc

6284
01:51:16,629 --> 01:51:16,639
imperfections in arc
 

6285
01:51:16,639 --> 01:51:17,990
imperfections in arc
so that said you should you should

6286
01:51:17,990 --> 01:51:18,000
so that said you should you should
 

6287
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:19,750
so that said you should you should
consider arc as a work in progress

6288
01:51:19,750 --> 01:51:19,760
consider arc as a work in progress
 

6289
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:23,669
consider arc as a work in progress
it is not uh the definitive state

6290
01:51:23,669 --> 01:51:23,679
it is not uh the definitive state
 

6291
01:51:23,679 --> 01:51:26,470
it is not uh the definitive state
uh where where the the arc tasks today

6292
01:51:26,470 --> 01:51:26,480
uh where where the the arc tasks today
 

6293
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:27,030
uh where where the the arc tasks today
are not

6294
01:51:27,030 --> 01:51:27,040
are not
 

6295
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:29,750
are not
definitive states of the test i want to

6296
01:51:29,750 --> 01:51:29,760
definitive states of the test i want to
 

6297
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:31,350
definitive states of the test i want to
keep refining it

6298
01:51:31,350 --> 01:51:31,360
keep refining it
 

6299
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:34,470
keep refining it
um in the future i also think it should

6300
01:51:34,470 --> 01:51:34,480
um in the future i also think it should
 

6301
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:36,870
um in the future i also think it should
be possible to open up the creation of

6302
01:51:36,870 --> 01:51:36,880
be possible to open up the creation of
 

6303
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:37,589
be possible to open up the creation of
tasks

6304
01:51:37,589 --> 01:51:37,599
tasks
 

6305
01:51:37,599 --> 01:51:40,149
tasks
to a broad audience to do crowdsourcing

6306
01:51:40,149 --> 01:51:40,159
to a broad audience to do crowdsourcing
 

6307
01:51:40,159 --> 01:51:40,709
to a broad audience to do crowdsourcing
um

6308
01:51:40,709 --> 01:51:40,719
um
 

6309
01:51:40,719 --> 01:51:42,470
um
that would involve several levels of

6310
01:51:42,470 --> 01:51:42,480
that would involve several levels of
 

6311
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:43,990
that would involve several levels of
filtering obviously

6312
01:51:43,990 --> 01:51:44,000
filtering obviously
 

6313
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:45,430
filtering obviously
but i think it's possible to apply

6314
01:51:45,430 --> 01:51:45,440
but i think it's possible to apply
 

6315
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:47,430
but i think it's possible to apply
crowdsourcing to to develop a much

6316
01:51:47,430 --> 01:51:47,440
crowdsourcing to to develop a much
 

6317
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:50,709
crowdsourcing to to develop a much
bigger and much more diverse arc data

6318
01:51:50,709 --> 01:51:50,719
bigger and much more diverse arc data
 

6319
01:51:50,719 --> 01:51:51,030
bigger and much more diverse arc data
set

6320
01:51:51,030 --> 01:51:51,040
set
 

6321
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:53,350
set
that would also be free of potentially

6322
01:51:53,350 --> 01:51:53,360
that would also be free of potentially
 

6323
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:54,310
that would also be free of potentially
you know some of

6324
01:51:54,310 --> 01:51:54,320
you know some of
 

6325
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:56,950
you know some of
my own personal biases but is there

6326
01:51:56,950 --> 01:51:56,960
my own personal biases but is there
 

6327
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:58,229
my own personal biases but is there
always need to be

6328
01:51:58,229 --> 01:51:58,239
always need to be
 

6329
01:51:58,239 --> 01:52:01,589
always need to be
a part of arc that's the test like

6330
01:52:01,589 --> 01:52:01,599
a part of arc that's the test like
 

6331
01:52:01,599 --> 01:52:04,629
a part of arc that's the test like
is hidden yes absolutely it is

6332
01:52:04,629 --> 01:52:04,639
is hidden yes absolutely it is
 

6333
01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:07,910
is hidden yes absolutely it is
impressive that uh the

6334
01:52:07,910 --> 01:52:07,920
impressive that uh the
 

6335
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:10,149
impressive that uh the
test that you're using to actually

6336
01:52:10,149 --> 01:52:10,159
test that you're using to actually
 

6337
01:52:10,159 --> 01:52:10,950
test that you're using to actually
benchmark

6338
01:52:10,950 --> 01:52:10,960
benchmark
 

6339
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:13,430

people developing these algorithms
 

6343
01:52:15,119 --> 01:52:16,550
people developing these algorithms
because otherwise what's going to happen

6344
01:52:16,550 --> 01:52:16,560
because otherwise what's going to happen
 

6345
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:19,030
because otherwise what's going to happen
is that the human engineers are just

6346
01:52:19,030 --> 01:52:19,040
is that the human engineers are just
 

6347
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:19,669
is that the human engineers are just
going to

6348
01:52:19,669 --> 01:52:19,679
going to
 

6349
01:52:19,679 --> 01:52:22,470
going to
solve the tasks themselves and and

6350
01:52:22,470 --> 01:52:22,480
solve the tasks themselves and and
 

6351
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:24,709
solve the tasks themselves and and
encode their solution in program form

6352
01:52:24,709 --> 01:52:24,719
encode their solution in program form
 

6353
01:52:24,719 --> 01:52:27,430
encode their solution in program form
but that again what you're seeing here

6354
01:52:27,430 --> 01:52:27,440
but that again what you're seeing here
 

6355
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:28,149
but that again what you're seeing here
is

6356
01:52:28,149 --> 01:52:28,159
is
 

6357
01:52:28,159 --> 01:52:30,070
is
the process of intelligence happening in

6358
01:52:30,070 --> 01:52:30,080
the process of intelligence happening in
 

6359
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:31,430
the process of intelligence happening in
the mind of the human and

6360
01:52:31,430 --> 01:52:31,440
the mind of the human and
 

6361
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:34,149
the mind of the human and
and then you're just uh capturing its

6362
01:52:34,149 --> 01:52:34,159
and then you're just uh capturing its
 

6363
01:52:34,159 --> 01:52:35,669
and then you're just uh capturing its
crystallized output but that

6364
01:52:35,669 --> 01:52:35,679
crystallized output but that
 

6365
01:52:35,679 --> 01:52:37,109
crystallized output but that
crystallized output

6366
01:52:37,109 --> 01:52:37,119
crystallized output
 

6367
01:52:37,119 --> 01:52:39,030
crystallized output
is not the same thing as the process

6368
01:52:39,030 --> 01:52:39,040
is not the same thing as the process
 

6369
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:40,310
is not the same thing as the process
generated that's right it's not

6370
01:52:40,310 --> 01:52:40,320
generated that's right it's not
 

6371
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:42,070
generated that's right it's not
intelligent in itself so what uh

6372
01:52:42,070 --> 01:52:42,080
intelligent in itself so what uh
 

6373
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:43,910
intelligent in itself so what uh
by the way the idea of crowdsourcing it

6374
01:52:43,910 --> 01:52:43,920
by the way the idea of crowdsourcing it
 

6375
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:45,830
by the way the idea of crowdsourcing it
is fascinating

6376
01:52:45,830 --> 01:52:45,840
is fascinating
 

6377
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:48,390
is fascinating
i think i think the creation of

6378
01:52:48,390 --> 01:52:48,400
i think i think the creation of
 

6379
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:49,830
i think i think the creation of
questions

6380
01:52:49,830 --> 01:52:49,840
questions
 

6381
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:52,229
questions
is really exciting for people i think i

6382
01:52:52,229 --> 01:52:52,239
is really exciting for people i think i
 

6383
01:52:52,239 --> 01:52:53,589
is really exciting for people i think i
think there's a lot of really brilliant

6384
01:52:53,589 --> 01:52:53,599
think there's a lot of really brilliant
 

6385
01:52:53,599 --> 01:52:55,109
think there's a lot of really brilliant
people out there that love to create

6386
01:52:55,109 --> 01:52:55,119
people out there that love to create
 

6387
01:52:55,119 --> 01:52:56,149
people out there that love to create
these kinds of stuff

6388
01:52:56,149 --> 01:52:56,159
these kinds of stuff
 

6389
01:52:56,159 --> 01:52:58,310
these kinds of stuff
yeah one thing that uh that kind of

6390
01:52:58,310 --> 01:52:58,320
yeah one thing that uh that kind of
 

6391
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:00,070
yeah one thing that uh that kind of
surprised me that i wasn't expecting is

6392
01:53:00,070 --> 01:53:00,080
surprised me that i wasn't expecting is
 

6393
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:00,790
surprised me that i wasn't expecting is
that

6394
01:53:00,790 --> 01:53:00,800
that
 

6395
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:03,510
that
lots of people seem to actually enjoy

6396
01:53:03,510 --> 01:53:03,520
lots of people seem to actually enjoy
 

6397
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:05,910
lots of people seem to actually enjoy
ark as a as a kind of game

6398
01:53:05,910 --> 01:53:05,920
ark as a as a kind of game
 

6399
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:08,709
ark as a as a kind of game
and i was really seeing it as as a test

6400
01:53:08,709 --> 01:53:08,719
and i was really seeing it as as a test
 

6401
01:53:08,719 --> 01:53:10,229
and i was really seeing it as as a test
as a benchmark

6402
01:53:10,229 --> 01:53:10,239
as a benchmark
 

6403
01:53:10,239 --> 01:53:13,990
as a benchmark
uh of uh a fluid uh general intelligence

6404
01:53:13,990 --> 01:53:14,000
uh of uh a fluid uh general intelligence
 

6405
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,950
uh of uh a fluid uh general intelligence
and lots of people just including kids

6406
01:53:16,950 --> 01:53:16,960
and lots of people just including kids
 

6407
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:18,470
and lots of people just including kids
just started you know enjoying it as a

6408
01:53:18,470 --> 01:53:18,480
just started you know enjoying it as a
 

6409
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:19,589
just started you know enjoying it as a
game so i think that's that's

6410
01:53:19,589 --> 01:53:19,599
game so i think that's that's
 

6411
01:53:19,599 --> 01:53:20,870
game so i think that's that's
encouraging

6412
01:53:20,870 --> 01:53:20,880
encouraging
 

6413
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:22,790
encouraging
yeah i'm fascinated by there's a world

6414
01:53:22,790 --> 01:53:22,800
yeah i'm fascinated by there's a world
 

6415
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:24,830
yeah i'm fascinated by there's a world
of people who create iq

6416
01:53:24,830 --> 01:53:24,840
of people who create iq
 

6417
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:27,750
of people who create iq
questions i think

6418
01:53:27,750 --> 01:53:27,760
questions i think
 

6419
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:30,629
questions i think
i think that's a cool uh it's a cool

6420
01:53:30,629 --> 01:53:30,639
i think that's a cool uh it's a cool
 

6421
01:53:30,639 --> 01:53:32,470
i think that's a cool uh it's a cool
activity for machines that for humans

6422
01:53:32,470 --> 01:53:32,480
activity for machines that for humans
 

6423
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:33,910
activity for machines that for humans
and people

6424
01:53:33,910 --> 01:53:33,920
and people
 

6425
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:36,550
and people
humans are themselves fascinated by

6426
01:53:36,550 --> 01:53:36,560
humans are themselves fascinated by
 

6427
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:39,109
humans are themselves fascinated by
taking the questions like

6428
01:53:39,109 --> 01:53:39,119
taking the questions like
 

6429
01:53:39,119 --> 01:53:40,470
taking the questions like
you know measuring their own

6430
01:53:40,470 --> 01:53:40,480
you know measuring their own
 

6431
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:42,229
you know measuring their own
intelligence

6432
01:53:42,229 --> 01:53:42,239
intelligence
 

6433
01:53:42,239 --> 01:53:44,310
intelligence
i mean that's just really compelling

6434
01:53:44,310 --> 01:53:44,320
i mean that's just really compelling
 

6435
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:45,830
i mean that's just really compelling
it's really interesting to me too it

6436
01:53:45,830 --> 01:53:45,840
it's really interesting to me too it
 

6437
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:46,950
it's really interesting to me too it
helps

6438
01:53:46,950 --> 01:53:46,960
helps
 

6439
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:48,390
helps
one of the cool things about arc you

6440
01:53:48,390 --> 01:53:48,400
one of the cool things about arc you
 

6441
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:50,790
one of the cool things about arc you
said it's kind of uh inspired by iq

6442
01:53:50,790 --> 01:53:50,800
said it's kind of uh inspired by iq
 

6443
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:52,950
said it's kind of uh inspired by iq
tests or whatever follows a similar

6444
01:53:52,950 --> 01:53:52,960
tests or whatever follows a similar
 

6445
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:54,950
tests or whatever follows a similar
process but because of its nature

6446
01:53:54,950 --> 01:53:54,960
process but because of its nature
 

6447
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:57,030
process but because of its nature
because of the context in which it lives

6448
01:53:57,030 --> 01:53:57,040
because of the context in which it lives
 

6449
01:53:57,040 --> 01:54:00,229
because of the context in which it lives
it immediately forces you to think about

6450
01:54:00,229 --> 01:54:00,239
it immediately forces you to think about
 

6451
01:54:00,239 --> 01:54:02,229
it immediately forces you to think about
the nature of intelligence as opposed to

6452
01:54:02,229 --> 01:54:02,239
the nature of intelligence as opposed to
 

6453
01:54:02,239 --> 01:54:04,790
the nature of intelligence as opposed to
just a test of your own like it forces

6454
01:54:04,790 --> 01:54:04,800
just a test of your own like it forces
 

6455
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:07,430
just a test of your own like it forces
you to really think there's i don't know

6456
01:54:07,430 --> 01:54:07,440
you to really think there's i don't know
 

6457
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:09,830
you to really think there's i don't know
if it's if it's within the question

6458
01:54:09,830 --> 01:54:09,840
if it's if it's within the question
 

6459
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:11,510
if it's if it's within the question
inherent in the question or just the

6460
01:54:11,510 --> 01:54:11,520
inherent in the question or just the
 

6461
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:12,550
inherent in the question or just the
fact that it lives

6462
01:54:12,550 --> 01:54:12,560
fact that it lives
 

6463
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:14,149
fact that it lives
in the test that's supposed to be a test

6464
01:54:14,149 --> 01:54:14,159
in the test that's supposed to be a test
 

6465
01:54:14,159 --> 01:54:16,149
in the test that's supposed to be a test
of machine intelligence absolutely as

6466
01:54:16,149 --> 01:54:16,159
of machine intelligence absolutely as
 

6467
01:54:16,159 --> 01:54:16,629
of machine intelligence absolutely as
you

6468
01:54:16,629 --> 01:54:16,639
you
 

6469
01:54:16,639 --> 01:54:20,629
you
as you solve arc tasks as a human

6470
01:54:20,629 --> 01:54:20,639
as you solve arc tasks as a human
 

6471
01:54:20,639 --> 01:54:23,270
as you solve arc tasks as a human
you will uh be forced to basically

6472
01:54:23,270 --> 01:54:23,280
you will uh be forced to basically
 

6473
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:24,229
you will uh be forced to basically
introspect

6474
01:54:24,229 --> 01:54:24,239
introspect
 

6475
01:54:24,239 --> 01:54:26,149
introspect
yeah higher how you come up with

6476
01:54:26,149 --> 01:54:26,159
yeah higher how you come up with
 

6477
01:54:26,159 --> 01:54:29,030
yeah higher how you come up with
solutions and that forces you to reflect

6478
01:54:29,030 --> 01:54:29,040
solutions and that forces you to reflect
 

6479
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:33,830
solutions and that forces you to reflect
on uh the human problem solving process

6480
01:54:33,830 --> 01:54:33,840
on uh the human problem solving process
 

6481
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:37,350
on uh the human problem solving process
and the way your own mind uh generates

6482
01:54:37,350 --> 01:54:37,360
and the way your own mind uh generates
 

6483
01:54:37,360 --> 01:54:41,270
and the way your own mind uh generates
uh abstract representations

6484
01:54:41,270 --> 01:54:41,280
uh abstract representations
 

6485
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:44,709
uh abstract representations
of the problems uh it's exposed to

6486
01:54:44,709 --> 01:54:44,719
of the problems uh it's exposed to
 

6487
01:54:44,719 --> 01:54:47,750
of the problems uh it's exposed to
i i think it's due to the fact that the

6488
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:47,760
i i think it's due to the fact that the
 

6489
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:50,070
i i think it's due to the fact that the
set of core knowledge priors

6490
01:54:50,070 --> 01:54:50,080
set of core knowledge priors
 

6491
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:52,870
set of core knowledge priors
that arc is built upon is so small it's

6492
01:54:52,870 --> 01:54:52,880
that arc is built upon is so small it's
 

6493
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:53,350
that arc is built upon is so small it's
all

6494
01:54:53,350 --> 01:54:53,360
all
 

6495
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:56,790
all
a recombination of a very very

6496
01:54:56,790 --> 01:54:56,800
a recombination of a very very
 

6497
01:54:56,800 --> 01:55:00,390
a recombination of a very very
small set of assumptions

6498
01:55:00,390 --> 01:55:00,400
small set of assumptions
 

6499
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:03,350
small set of assumptions
okay so what's the future of ark so you

6500
01:55:03,350 --> 01:55:03,360
okay so what's the future of ark so you
 

6501
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:05,350
okay so what's the future of ark so you
you held arc as a challenge as part of

6502
01:55:05,350 --> 01:55:05,360
you held arc as a challenge as part of
 

6503
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:06,629
you held arc as a challenge as part of
like a kegel competition

6504
01:55:06,629 --> 01:55:06,639
like a kegel competition
 

6505
01:55:06,639 --> 01:55:10,149
like a kegel competition
yes calgary competition and

6506
01:55:10,149 --> 01:55:10,159
yes calgary competition and
 

6507
01:55:10,159 --> 01:55:12,470
yes calgary competition and
uh what do you think do you think that's

6508
01:55:12,470 --> 01:55:12,480
uh what do you think do you think that's
 

6509
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:14,790
uh what do you think do you think that's
something that continues for

6510
01:55:14,790 --> 01:55:14,800
something that continues for
 

6511
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:16,950
something that continues for
five years ten years like just continues

6512
01:55:16,950 --> 01:55:16,960
five years ten years like just continues
 

6513
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:18,870
five years ten years like just continues
growing yes absolutely

6514
01:55:18,870 --> 01:55:18,880
growing yes absolutely
 

6515
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:21,510
growing yes absolutely
so arc itself will keep evolving so i've

6516
01:55:21,510 --> 01:55:21,520
so arc itself will keep evolving so i've
 

6517
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:22,950
so arc itself will keep evolving so i've
talked about crowdsourcing i think

6518
01:55:22,950 --> 01:55:22,960
talked about crowdsourcing i think
 

6519
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:24,550
talked about crowdsourcing i think
that's a that's a

6520
01:55:24,550 --> 01:55:24,560
that's a that's a
 

6521
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:27,669
that's a that's a
good avenue another thing i'm starting

6522
01:55:27,669 --> 01:55:27,679
good avenue another thing i'm starting
 

6523
01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:28,950
good avenue another thing i'm starting
is

6524
01:55:28,950 --> 01:55:28,960
is
 

6525
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:31,430
is
i'll be collaborating with folks from

6526
01:55:31,430 --> 01:55:31,440
i'll be collaborating with folks from
 

6527
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:34,149
i'll be collaborating with folks from
the psychology department at nyu

6528
01:55:34,149 --> 01:55:34,159
the psychology department at nyu
 

6529
01:55:34,159 --> 01:55:37,270
the psychology department at nyu
to do human testing on arc and i think

6530
01:55:37,270 --> 01:55:37,280
to do human testing on arc and i think
 

6531
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:38,870
to do human testing on arc and i think
there are lots of interesting questions

6532
01:55:38,870 --> 01:55:38,880
there are lots of interesting questions
 

6533
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:41,189
there are lots of interesting questions
you can start asking especially as you

6534
01:55:41,189 --> 01:55:41,199
you can start asking especially as you
 

6535
01:55:41,199 --> 01:55:45,109
you can start asking especially as you
start correlating machine solutions

6536
01:55:45,109 --> 01:55:45,119
start correlating machine solutions
 

6537
01:55:45,119 --> 01:55:48,149
start correlating machine solutions
to arc tasks and and

6538
01:55:48,149 --> 01:55:48,159
to arc tasks and and
 

6539
01:55:48,159 --> 01:55:49,990
to arc tasks and and
the human characteristics of solutions

6540
01:55:49,990 --> 01:55:50,000
the human characteristics of solutions
 

6541
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,350
the human characteristics of solutions
like for instance you can

6542
01:55:51,350 --> 01:55:51,360
like for instance you can
 

6543
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:53,510
like for instance you can
try to see if there's a relationship

6544
01:55:53,510 --> 01:55:53,520
try to see if there's a relationship
 

6545
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:54,709
try to see if there's a relationship
between the

6546
01:55:54,709 --> 01:55:54,719
between the
 

6547
01:55:54,719 --> 01:55:57,750
between the
human perceived difficulty of a task

6548
01:55:57,750 --> 01:55:57,760
human perceived difficulty of a task
 

6549
01:55:57,760 --> 01:56:00,390
human perceived difficulty of a task
and the machine person yes and and

6550
01:56:00,390 --> 01:56:00,400
and the machine person yes and and
 

6551
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:01,830
and the machine person yes and and
exactly some measure of machine

6552
01:56:01,830 --> 01:56:01,840
exactly some measure of machine
 

6553
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:03,030
exactly some measure of machine
perceived difficulties yeah

6554
01:56:03,030 --> 01:56:03,040
perceived difficulties yeah
 

6555
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:04,950
perceived difficulties yeah
it's a nice big playground in which to

6556
01:56:04,950 --> 01:56:04,960
it's a nice big playground in which to
 

6557
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:06,310
it's a nice big playground in which to
explore this very difference

6558
01:56:06,310 --> 01:56:06,320
explore this very difference
 

6559
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:07,589
explore this very difference
it's the same thing as we talked about

6560
01:56:07,589 --> 01:56:07,599
it's the same thing as we talked about
 

6561
01:56:07,599 --> 01:56:09,669
it's the same thing as we talked about
the autonomous vehicles the things that

6562
01:56:09,669 --> 01:56:09,679
the autonomous vehicles the things that
 

6563
01:56:09,679 --> 01:56:11,109
the autonomous vehicles the things that
could be difficult for humans might be

6564
01:56:11,109 --> 01:56:11,119
could be difficult for humans might be
 

6565
01:56:11,119 --> 01:56:12,550
could be difficult for humans might be
very different than the things that yes

6566
01:56:12,550 --> 01:56:12,560
very different than the things that yes
 

6567
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:15,750
very different than the things that yes
absolutely and uh formalizing or making

6568
01:56:15,750 --> 01:56:15,760
absolutely and uh formalizing or making
 

6569
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:16,470
absolutely and uh formalizing or making
explicit

6570
01:56:16,470 --> 01:56:16,480
explicit
 

6571
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:18,709
explicit
that difference in difficulty will teach

6572
01:56:18,709 --> 01:56:18,719
that difference in difficulty will teach
 

6573
01:56:18,719 --> 01:56:20,390
that difference in difficulty will teach
us something may teach us something

6574
01:56:20,390 --> 01:56:20,400
us something may teach us something
 

6575
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:22,070
us something may teach us something
fundamental about intelligence

6576
01:56:22,070 --> 01:56:22,080
fundamental about intelligence
 

6577
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:24,390
fundamental about intelligence
so one thing i think we did well uh with

6578
01:56:24,390 --> 01:56:24,400
so one thing i think we did well uh with
 

6579
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:26,390
so one thing i think we did well uh with
arc

6580
01:56:26,390 --> 01:56:26,400
arc
 

6581
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:29,669
arc
is that it's proving to be a very

6582
01:56:29,669 --> 01:56:29,679
is that it's proving to be a very
 

6583
01:56:29,679 --> 01:56:33,910
is that it's proving to be a very
uh actionable test in the sense that

6584
01:56:33,910 --> 01:56:33,920
uh actionable test in the sense that
 

6585
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:36,070
uh actionable test in the sense that
uh machine performance and arcs started

6586
01:56:36,070 --> 01:56:36,080
uh machine performance and arcs started
 

6587
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:37,189
uh machine performance and arcs started
at very much

6588
01:56:37,189 --> 01:56:37,199
at very much
 

6589
01:56:37,199 --> 01:56:40,229
at very much
zero initially while you know

6590
01:56:40,229 --> 01:56:40,239
zero initially while you know
 

6591
01:56:40,239 --> 01:56:42,390
zero initially while you know
humans found actually the tasks very

6592
01:56:42,390 --> 01:56:42,400
humans found actually the tasks very
 

6593
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:43,270
humans found actually the tasks very
easy

6594
01:56:43,270 --> 01:56:43,280
easy
 

6595
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:47,030
easy
and that that alone was like a big red

6596
01:56:47,030 --> 01:56:47,040
and that that alone was like a big red
 

6597
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:49,030
and that that alone was like a big red
flashing light saying that something is

6598
01:56:49,030 --> 01:56:49,040
flashing light saying that something is
 

6599
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:49,750
flashing light saying that something is
going on

6600
01:56:49,750 --> 01:56:49,760
going on
 

6601
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:52,790
going on
and that we are missing something and at

6602
01:56:52,790 --> 01:56:52,800
and that we are missing something and at
 

6603
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:53,910
and that we are missing something and at
the same time

6604
01:56:53,910 --> 01:56:53,920
the same time
 

6605
01:56:53,920 --> 01:56:56,149
the same time
uh machine performance did not stay at

6606
01:56:56,149 --> 01:56:56,159
uh machine performance did not stay at
 

6607
01:56:56,159 --> 01:56:58,470
uh machine performance did not stay at
zero for very long actually within two

6608
01:56:58,470 --> 01:56:58,480
zero for very long actually within two
 

6609
01:56:58,480 --> 01:57:00,310
zero for very long actually within two
weeks of the carol competition we

6610
01:57:00,310 --> 01:57:00,320
weeks of the carol competition we
 

6611
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:01,750
weeks of the carol competition we
started having

6612
01:57:01,750 --> 01:57:01,760
started having
 

6613
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:04,149
started having
a non-zero number and now the state of

6614
01:57:04,149 --> 01:57:04,159
a non-zero number and now the state of
 

6615
01:57:04,159 --> 01:57:05,270
a non-zero number and now the state of
the art is around

6616
01:57:05,270 --> 01:57:05,280
the art is around
 

6617
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:08,229
the art is around
uh twenty percent of the test set uh

6618
01:57:08,229 --> 01:57:08,239
uh twenty percent of the test set uh
 

6619
01:57:08,239 --> 01:57:09,270
uh twenty percent of the test set uh
solved

6620
01:57:09,270 --> 01:57:09,280
solved
 

6621
01:57:09,280 --> 01:57:12,390
solved
um and so arc is actually a challenge

6622
01:57:12,390 --> 01:57:12,400
um and so arc is actually a challenge
 

6623
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:13,589
um and so arc is actually a challenge
where

6624
01:57:13,589 --> 01:57:13,599
where
 

6625
01:57:13,599 --> 01:57:16,229
where
our capabilities start at zero which

6626
01:57:16,229 --> 01:57:16,239
our capabilities start at zero which
 

6627
01:57:16,239 --> 01:57:18,149
our capabilities start at zero which
indicates the need for progress

6628
01:57:18,149 --> 01:57:18,159
indicates the need for progress
 

6629
01:57:18,159 --> 01:57:20,470
indicates the need for progress
but it's also not an impossible change

6630
01:57:20,470 --> 01:57:20,480
but it's also not an impossible change
 

6631
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:22,470
but it's also not an impossible change
it's not accessible you can start making

6632
01:57:22,470 --> 01:57:22,480
it's not accessible you can start making
 

6633
01:57:22,480 --> 01:57:23,830
it's not accessible you can start making
progress

6634
01:57:23,830 --> 01:57:23,840
progress
 

6635
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:27,030
progress
basically right away at the same time

6636
01:57:27,030 --> 01:57:27,040
basically right away at the same time
 

6637
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:29,109
basically right away at the same time
we are still very far from having solved

6638
01:57:29,109 --> 01:57:29,119
we are still very far from having solved
 

6639
01:57:29,119 --> 01:57:31,189
we are still very far from having solved
it and that's actually

6640
01:57:31,189 --> 01:57:31,199
it and that's actually
 

6641
01:57:31,199 --> 01:57:32,950
it and that's actually
a very positive outcome of the

6642
01:57:32,950 --> 01:57:32,960
a very positive outcome of the
 

6643
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:34,950
a very positive outcome of the
competition is that the competition has

6644
01:57:34,950 --> 01:57:34,960
competition is that the competition has
 

6645
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:38,229
competition is that the competition has
has proven that there was

6646
01:57:38,229 --> 01:57:38,239
has proven that there was
 

6647
01:57:38,239 --> 01:57:41,430
has proven that there was
no obvious shortcut to solve these tasks

6648
01:57:41,430 --> 01:57:41,440
no obvious shortcut to solve these tasks
 

6649
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:43,350
no obvious shortcut to solve these tasks
right yeah so the test held up yeah

6650
01:57:43,350 --> 01:57:43,360
right yeah so the test held up yeah
 

6651
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:45,830
right yeah so the test held up yeah
exactly that was the primary reason to

6652
01:57:45,830 --> 01:57:45,840
exactly that was the primary reason to
 

6653
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:48,470
exactly that was the primary reason to
do the cargo competition is to check

6654
01:57:48,470 --> 01:57:48,480
do the cargo competition is to check
 

6655
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:51,430
do the cargo competition is to check
if some some you know clever person was

6656
01:57:51,430 --> 01:57:51,440
if some some you know clever person was
 

6657
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:51,990
if some some you know clever person was
going to

6658
01:57:51,990 --> 01:57:52,000
going to
 

6659
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:55,189
going to
hack the benchmark and that did not

6660
01:57:55,189 --> 01:57:55,199
hack the benchmark and that did not
 

6661
01:57:55,199 --> 01:57:55,830
hack the benchmark and that did not
happen

6662
01:57:55,830 --> 01:57:55,840
happen
 

6663
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:57,430
happen
right like people who are solving the

6664
01:57:57,430 --> 01:57:57,440
right like people who are solving the
 

6665
01:57:57,440 --> 01:57:59,430
right like people who are solving the
tasks are essentially doing it

6666
01:57:59,430 --> 01:57:59,440
tasks are essentially doing it
 

6667
01:57:59,440 --> 01:58:02,629
tasks are essentially doing it
uh uh well in a way they're they're

6668
01:58:02,629 --> 01:58:02,639
uh uh well in a way they're they're
 

6669
01:58:02,639 --> 01:58:05,030
uh uh well in a way they're they're
they're actually exploiting some flaws

6670
01:58:05,030 --> 01:58:05,040
they're actually exploiting some flaws
 

6671
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:06,870
they're actually exploiting some flaws
of art that we will need to address in

6672
01:58:06,870 --> 01:58:06,880
of art that we will need to address in
 

6673
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:08,310
of art that we will need to address in
the future especially they're

6674
01:58:08,310 --> 01:58:08,320
the future especially they're
 

6675
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:11,109
the future especially they're
essentially anticipating what sort of uh

6676
01:58:11,109 --> 01:58:11,119
essentially anticipating what sort of uh
 

6677
01:58:11,119 --> 01:58:13,189
essentially anticipating what sort of uh
tasks may be contained in the test sets

6678
01:58:13,189 --> 01:58:13,199
tasks may be contained in the test sets
 

6679
01:58:13,199 --> 01:58:16,550
tasks may be contained in the test sets
right right um which is kind of

6680
01:58:16,550 --> 01:58:16,560
right right um which is kind of
 

6681
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:18,790
right right um which is kind of
yeah that's the kind of hacking it's

6682
01:58:18,790 --> 01:58:18,800
yeah that's the kind of hacking it's
 

6683
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:20,470
yeah that's the kind of hacking it's
it's human hacking of the town yes

6684
01:58:20,470 --> 01:58:20,480
it's human hacking of the town yes
 

6685
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:22,629
it's human hacking of the town yes
that that said you know uh uh with the

6686
01:58:22,629 --> 01:58:22,639
that that said you know uh uh with the
 

6687
01:58:22,639 --> 01:58:23,830
that that said you know uh uh with the
state of the art it's like

6688
01:58:23,830 --> 01:58:23,840
state of the art it's like
 

6689
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:26,950
state of the art it's like
uh 20 percent we're still very very far

6690
01:58:26,950 --> 01:58:26,960
uh 20 percent we're still very very far
 

6691
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:28,870
uh 20 percent we're still very very far
uh from even level which is closer to

6692
01:58:28,870 --> 01:58:28,880
uh from even level which is closer to
 

6693
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:29,990
uh from even level which is closer to
100

6694
01:58:29,990 --> 01:58:30,000
100
 

6695
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,790
100
and so and i i do believe that you know

6696
01:58:32,790 --> 01:58:32,800
and so and i i do believe that you know
 

6697
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:33,270
and so and i i do believe that you know
it will

6698
01:58:33,270 --> 01:58:33,280
it will
 

6699
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:36,390
it will
it will take a while uh until

6700
01:58:36,390 --> 01:58:36,400
it will take a while uh until
 

6701
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:39,510
it will take a while uh until
we reach a human parity

6702
01:58:39,510 --> 01:58:39,520
we reach a human parity
 

6703
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:42,310
we reach a human parity
on ark and that by the time we have

6704
01:58:42,310 --> 01:58:42,320
on ark and that by the time we have
 

6705
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:43,510
on ark and that by the time we have
human party

6706
01:58:43,510 --> 01:58:43,520
human party
 

6707
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:46,470
human party
we will have ai systems that are

6708
01:58:46,470 --> 01:58:46,480
we will have ai systems that are
 

6709
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:48,470
we will have ai systems that are
probably pretty close to human level

6710
01:58:48,470 --> 01:58:48,480
probably pretty close to human level
 

6711
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:51,430
probably pretty close to human level
in terms of general fluid intelligence

6712
01:58:51,430 --> 01:58:51,440
in terms of general fluid intelligence
 

6713
01:58:51,440 --> 01:58:52,709
in terms of general fluid intelligence
which is i mean it's

6714
01:58:52,709 --> 01:58:52,719
which is i mean it's
 

6715
01:58:52,719 --> 01:58:54,070
which is i mean it's
they're not going to be necessarily

6716
01:58:54,070 --> 01:58:54,080
they're not going to be necessarily
 

6717
01:58:54,080 --> 01:58:56,470
they're not going to be necessarily
human-like they're not necessarily

6718
01:58:56,470 --> 01:58:56,480
human-like they're not necessarily
 

6719
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:59,189
human-like they're not necessarily
uh you would not necessarily recognize

6720
01:58:59,189 --> 01:58:59,199
uh you would not necessarily recognize
 

6721
01:58:59,199 --> 01:59:01,830
uh you would not necessarily recognize
them as you know being an egi

6722
01:59:01,830 --> 01:59:01,840
them as you know being an egi
 

6723
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:04,950
them as you know being an egi
but they would be capable of a degree of

6724
01:59:04,950 --> 01:59:04,960
but they would be capable of a degree of
 

6725
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:07,830
but they would be capable of a degree of
generalization that matches the

6726
01:59:07,830 --> 01:59:07,840
generalization that matches the
 

6727
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:09,270
generalization that matches the
generalization

6728
01:59:09,270 --> 01:59:09,280

01:59:11,350 --> 01:59:11,360
performed by human food intelligence
 

6731
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:13,030
performed by human food intelligence
sure i mean this is a good point in

6732
01:59:13,030 --> 01:59:13,040
sure i mean this is a good point in
 

6733
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:14,070
sure i mean this is a good point in
terms of

6734
01:59:14,070 --> 01:59:14,080
terms of
 

6735
01:59:14,080 --> 01:59:17,109
terms of
general flu intelligence to mention in

6736
01:59:17,109 --> 01:59:17,119
general flu intelligence to mention in
 

6737
01:59:17,119 --> 01:59:18,709
general flu intelligence to mention in
your paper you describe different kinds

6738
01:59:18,709 --> 01:59:18,719
your paper you describe different kinds
 

6739
01:59:18,719 --> 01:59:20,390
your paper you describe different kinds
of generalizations

6740
01:59:20,390 --> 01:59:20,400
of generalizations
 

6741
01:59:20,400 --> 01:59:23,910
of generalizations
uh local broad extreme and there's kind

6742
01:59:23,910 --> 01:59:23,920
uh local broad extreme and there's kind
 

6743
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:25,430
uh local broad extreme and there's kind
of a hierarchy that you form

6744
01:59:25,430 --> 01:59:25,440
of a hierarchy that you form
 

6745
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:30,550
of a hierarchy that you form
so when we say generalizations

6746
01:59:30,550 --> 01:59:30,560

 

6747
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:32,470

what are we talking about what kinds are

6748
01:59:32,470 --> 01:59:32,480
what are we talking about what kinds are
 

6749
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:33,589
what are we talking about what kinds are
there right

6750
01:59:33,589 --> 01:59:33,599
there right
 

6751
01:59:33,599 --> 01:59:36,870
there right
so uh generalization is is very old idea

6752
01:59:36,870 --> 01:59:36,880
so uh generalization is is very old idea
 

6753
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:37,350
so uh generalization is is very old idea
i mean

6754
01:59:37,350 --> 01:59:37,360
i mean
 

6755
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:39,510
i mean
it's even older than machine learning in

6756
01:59:39,510 --> 01:59:39,520
it's even older than machine learning in
 

6757
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:41,750
it's even older than machine learning in
the context of machine learning you say

6758
01:59:41,750 --> 01:59:41,760
the context of machine learning you say
 

6759
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:45,030
the context of machine learning you say
a system generalizes if it can uh

6760
01:59:45,030 --> 01:59:45,040
a system generalizes if it can uh
 

6761
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:48,070
a system generalizes if it can uh
make sense of an input it has it has not

6762
01:59:48,070 --> 01:59:48,080
make sense of an input it has it has not
 

6763
01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:49,510
make sense of an input it has it has not
yet seen

6764
01:59:49,510 --> 01:59:49,520
yet seen
 

6765
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:51,390
yet seen
and that's what i would call a

6766
01:59:51,390 --> 01:59:51,400
and that's what i would call a
 

6767
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:53,030
and that's what i would call a
system-centric

6768
01:59:53,030 --> 01:59:53,040
system-centric
 

6769
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:56,870
system-centric
uh generalization you is generalization

6770
01:59:56,870 --> 01:59:56,880
uh generalization you is generalization
 

6771
01:59:56,880 --> 01:59:59,910
uh generalization you is generalization
with respect to novelty

6772
01:59:59,910 --> 01:59:59,920
with respect to novelty
 

6773
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:01,830
with respect to novelty
uh for the specific system you're

6774
02:00:01,830 --> 02:00:01,840
uh for the specific system you're
 

6775
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:04,390
uh for the specific system you're
considering so i think a good test of

6776
02:00:04,390 --> 02:00:04,400
considering so i think a good test of
 

6777
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:05,589
considering so i think a good test of
intelligence should actually

6778
02:00:05,589 --> 02:00:05,599
intelligence should actually
 

6779
02:00:05,599 --> 02:00:09,030
intelligence should actually
uh deal with uh developer aware

6780
02:00:09,030 --> 02:00:09,040
uh deal with uh developer aware
 

6781
02:00:09,040 --> 02:00:10,830
uh deal with uh developer aware
generalization which is slightly

6782
02:00:10,830 --> 02:00:10,840
generalization which is slightly
 

6783
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:13,350
generalization which is slightly
stronger than system-centric transition

6784
02:00:13,350 --> 02:00:13,360
stronger than system-centric transition
 

6785
02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:15,030
stronger than system-centric transition
so developer generalization developer

6786
02:00:15,030 --> 02:00:15,040
so developer generalization developer
 

6787
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:18,390
so developer generalization developer
aware generalization would be

6788
02:00:18,390 --> 02:00:18,400

 

6789
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:20,550

the ability to generalize to novelty or

6790
02:00:20,550 --> 02:00:20,560
the ability to generalize to novelty or
 

6791
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:21,990
the ability to generalize to novelty or
uncertainty that

6792
02:00:21,990 --> 02:00:22,000
uncertainty that
 

6793
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,310
uncertainty that
not only the system itself has not

6794
02:00:24,310 --> 02:00:24,320
not only the system itself has not
 

6795
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:25,990
not only the system itself has not
accessed to but the developer of the

6796
02:00:25,990 --> 02:00:26,000
accessed to but the developer of the
 

6797
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:26,550
accessed to but the developer of the
system

6798
02:00:26,550 --> 02:00:26,560
system
 

6799
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:29,270
system
could not have access to either that

6800
02:00:29,270 --> 02:00:29,280
could not have access to either that
 

6801
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:30,470
could not have access to either that
that's a fascinating that's a

6802
02:00:30,470 --> 02:00:30,480
that's a fascinating that's a
 

6803
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:32,310
that's a fascinating that's a
fascinating meta definition

6804
02:00:32,310 --> 02:00:32,320
fascinating meta definition
 

6805
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:36,709
fascinating meta definition
so like the system is uh it's basically

6806
02:00:36,709 --> 02:00:36,719
so like the system is uh it's basically
 

6807
02:00:36,719 --> 02:00:38,070
so like the system is uh it's basically
the edge case thing we're talking about

6808
02:00:38,070 --> 02:00:38,080
the edge case thing we're talking about
 

6809
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:39,350
the edge case thing we're talking about
with autonomous vehicles

6810
02:00:39,350 --> 02:00:39,360
with autonomous vehicles
 

6811
02:00:39,360 --> 02:00:41,589
with autonomous vehicles
yes neither the developer nor the system

6812
02:00:41,589 --> 02:00:41,599
yes neither the developer nor the system
 

6813
02:00:41,599 --> 02:00:44,310
yes neither the developer nor the system
know about the edge cases

6814
02:00:44,310 --> 02:00:44,320
know about the edge cases
 

6815
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:46,790
know about the edge cases
so it's up to they get the system should

6816
02:00:46,790 --> 02:00:46,800
so it's up to they get the system should
 

6817
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:49,270
so it's up to they get the system should
be able to generalize the thing that

6818
02:00:49,270 --> 02:00:49,280
be able to generalize the thing that
 

6819
02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:52,070
be able to generalize the thing that
that uh nobody expected neither the

6820
02:00:52,070 --> 02:00:52,080
that uh nobody expected neither the
 

6821
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:54,790
that uh nobody expected neither the
designer of the training data

6822
02:00:54,790 --> 02:00:54,800
designer of the training data
 

6823
02:00:54,800 --> 02:00:58,070
designer of the training data
nor obviously the contents of the

6824
02:00:58,070 --> 02:00:58,080
nor obviously the contents of the
 

6825
02:00:58,080 --> 02:00:58,870

6826
02:00:58,870 --> 02:00:58,880
training
 

6827
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:00,550
training
that's a fascinating definition so you

6828
02:01:00,550 --> 02:01:00,560
that's a fascinating definition so you
 

6829
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:02,310
that's a fascinating definition so you
can see generalization degrees of

6830
02:01:02,310 --> 02:01:02,320
can see generalization degrees of
 

6831
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:04,390
can see generalization degrees of
generalization as a spectrum

6832
02:01:04,390 --> 02:01:04,400
generalization as a spectrum
 

6833
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:07,669
generalization as a spectrum
and the lowest level is what machine

6834
02:01:07,669 --> 02:01:07,679
and the lowest level is what machine
 

6835
02:01:07,679 --> 02:01:07,990
and the lowest level is what machine
learning

6836
02:01:07,990 --> 02:01:08,000
learning
 

6837
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:11,990
learning
is trying to do is the assumption that

6838
02:01:11,990 --> 02:01:12,000
is trying to do is the assumption that
 

6839
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:15,189
is trying to do is the assumption that
any new situation is going to be sampled

6840
02:01:15,189 --> 02:01:15,199
any new situation is going to be sampled
 

6841
02:01:15,199 --> 02:01:17,589
any new situation is going to be sampled
from a static distribution of possible

6842
02:01:17,589 --> 02:01:17,599
from a static distribution of possible
 

6843
02:01:17,599 --> 02:01:18,310
from a static distribution of possible
situations

6844
02:01:18,310 --> 02:01:18,320
situations
 

6845
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:20,070
situations
and that you already have a

6846
02:01:20,070 --> 02:01:20,080
and that you already have a
 

6847
02:01:20,080 --> 02:01:21,750
and that you already have a
representative sample of that

6848
02:01:21,750 --> 02:01:21,760
representative sample of that
 

6849
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:23,750
representative sample of that
distribution that's your training data

6850
02:01:23,750 --> 02:01:23,760
distribution that's your training data
 

6851
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:24,790
distribution that's your training data
and so in machine learning you

6852
02:01:24,790 --> 02:01:24,800
and so in machine learning you
 

6853
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:27,430
and so in machine learning you
generalize to a new sample from a known

6854
02:01:27,430 --> 02:01:27,440
generalize to a new sample from a known
 

6855
02:01:27,440 --> 02:01:28,709
generalize to a new sample from a known
distribution

6856
02:01:28,709 --> 02:01:28,719
distribution
 

6857
02:01:28,719 --> 02:01:31,030
distribution
and the ways in which your new sample

6858
02:01:31,030 --> 02:01:31,040
and the ways in which your new sample
 

6859
02:01:31,040 --> 02:01:31,990
and the ways in which your new sample
will be

6860
02:01:31,990 --> 02:01:32,000
will be
 

6861
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:35,510
will be
new or different are ways that are

6862
02:01:35,510 --> 02:01:35,520
new or different are ways that are
 

6863
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:38,229
new or different are ways that are
already understood by the developers of

6864
02:01:38,229 --> 02:01:38,239
already understood by the developers of
 

6865
02:01:38,239 --> 02:01:39,189
already understood by the developers of
the system

6866
02:01:39,189 --> 02:01:39,199
the system
 

6867
02:01:39,199 --> 02:01:41,669
the system
so you are generalizing to known

6868
02:01:41,669 --> 02:01:41,679
so you are generalizing to known
 

6869
02:01:41,679 --> 02:01:42,950
so you are generalizing to known
unknowns

6870
02:01:42,950 --> 02:01:42,960
unknowns
 

6871
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:46,070
unknowns
for one specific task that's what you

6872
02:01:46,070 --> 02:01:46,080
for one specific task that's what you
 

6873
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:47,350
for one specific task that's what you
would call robustness

6874
02:01:47,350 --> 02:01:47,360
would call robustness
 

6875
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:49,109
would call robustness
you are robust to things like noise

6876
02:01:49,109 --> 02:01:49,119
you are robust to things like noise
 

6877
02:01:49,119 --> 02:01:51,430
you are robust to things like noise
small variations and so on

6878
02:01:51,430 --> 02:01:51,440
small variations and so on
 

6879
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:55,510
small variations and so on
um for one a fixed known

6880
02:01:55,510 --> 02:01:55,520
um for one a fixed known
 

6881
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:57,830
um for one a fixed known
distribution that that you know through

6882
02:01:57,830 --> 02:01:57,840
distribution that that you know through
 

6883
02:01:57,840 --> 02:01:59,270
distribution that that you know through
your training data

6884
02:01:59,270 --> 02:01:59,280
your training data
 

6885
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:03,750
your training data
and a higher degree would be

6886
02:02:03,750 --> 02:02:03,760
and a higher degree would be
 

6887
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:06,390
and a higher degree would be
flexibility in machine intelligence so

6888
02:02:06,390 --> 02:02:06,400
flexibility in machine intelligence so
 

6889
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:07,990
flexibility in machine intelligence so
flexibility would be

6890
02:02:07,990 --> 02:02:08,000
flexibility would be
 

6891
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:11,189
flexibility would be
something like an l5 cell driving car or

6892
02:02:11,189 --> 02:02:11,199
something like an l5 cell driving car or
 

6893
02:02:11,199 --> 02:02:13,910
something like an l5 cell driving car or
maybe a robot that can

6894
02:02:13,910 --> 02:02:13,920
maybe a robot that can
 

6895
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:16,390
maybe a robot that can
you know pass the the coffee cup test

6896
02:02:16,390 --> 02:02:16,400
you know pass the the coffee cup test
 

6897
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:17,189
you know pass the the coffee cup test
which is

6898
02:02:17,189 --> 02:02:17,199
which is
 

6899
02:02:17,199 --> 02:02:19,830
which is
the notion that you would be given a

6900
02:02:19,830 --> 02:02:19,840
the notion that you would be given a
 

6901
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:21,109
the notion that you would be given a
random kitchen

6902
02:02:21,109 --> 02:02:21,119
random kitchen
 

6903
02:02:21,119 --> 02:02:22,550
random kitchen
uh somewhere in the country and you

6904
02:02:22,550 --> 02:02:22,560
uh somewhere in the country and you
 

6905
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:24,550
uh somewhere in the country and you
would have to you know

6906
02:02:24,550 --> 02:02:24,560
would have to you know
 

6907
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:27,750
would have to you know
go make a cup of coffee in that kitchen

6908
02:02:27,750 --> 02:02:27,760
go make a cup of coffee in that kitchen
 

6909
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:30,310
go make a cup of coffee in that kitchen
right so flexibility would be the

6910
02:02:30,310 --> 02:02:30,320
right so flexibility would be the
 

6911
02:02:30,320 --> 02:02:31,669
right so flexibility would be the
ability to deal with

6912
02:02:31,669 --> 02:02:31,679
ability to deal with
 

6913
02:02:31,679 --> 02:02:33,990
ability to deal with
unknown unknowns so things that could

6914
02:02:33,990 --> 02:02:34,000
unknown unknowns so things that could
 

6915
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:34,870
unknown unknowns so things that could
not

6916
02:02:34,870 --> 02:02:34,880
not
 

6917
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:36,870
not
uh dimensions of viability that could

6918
02:02:36,870 --> 02:02:36,880
uh dimensions of viability that could
 

6919
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:39,189
uh dimensions of viability that could
not have been possibly foreseen

6920
02:02:39,189 --> 02:02:39,199
not have been possibly foreseen
 

6921
02:02:39,199 --> 02:02:41,669
not have been possibly foreseen
by the creators of the system within one

6922
02:02:41,669 --> 02:02:41,679
by the creators of the system within one
 

6923
02:02:41,679 --> 02:02:42,709
by the creators of the system within one
specific task

6924
02:02:42,709 --> 02:02:42,719
specific task
 

6925
02:02:42,719 --> 02:02:44,870
specific task
so generalizing to the long tail of

6926
02:02:44,870 --> 02:02:44,880
so generalizing to the long tail of
 

6927
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:46,149
so generalizing to the long tail of
situations

6928
02:02:46,149 --> 02:02:46,159
situations
 

6929
02:02:46,159 --> 02:02:47,669
situations
in self-driving for instance would be

6930
02:02:47,669 --> 02:02:47,679
in self-driving for instance would be
 

6931
02:02:47,679 --> 02:02:49,750
in self-driving for instance would be
flexibility so you have robustness

6932
02:02:49,750 --> 02:02:49,760
flexibility so you have robustness
 

6933
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:51,990
flexibility so you have robustness
flexibility and finally you would have

6934
02:02:51,990 --> 02:02:52,000
flexibility and finally you would have
 

6935
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,669
flexibility and finally you would have
extreme generalization

6936
02:02:53,669 --> 02:02:53,679
extreme generalization
 

6937
02:02:53,679 --> 02:02:57,270
extreme generalization
which is basically flexibility but

6938
02:02:57,270 --> 02:02:57,280
which is basically flexibility but
 

6939
02:02:57,280 --> 02:03:00,550
which is basically flexibility but
instead of just considering one specific

6940
02:03:00,550 --> 02:03:00,560
instead of just considering one specific
 

6941
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:03,189
instead of just considering one specific
domain like driving or domestic robotics

6942
02:03:03,189 --> 02:03:03,199
domain like driving or domestic robotics
 

6943
02:03:03,199 --> 02:03:06,149
domain like driving or domestic robotics
you're considering an open-ended range

6944
02:03:06,149 --> 02:03:06,159
you're considering an open-ended range
 

6945
02:03:06,159 --> 02:03:07,669
you're considering an open-ended range
of possible domains

6946
02:03:07,669 --> 02:03:07,679
of possible domains
 

6947
02:03:07,679 --> 02:03:11,430
of possible domains
so a robot would be capable of

6948
02:03:11,430 --> 02:03:11,440
so a robot would be capable of
 

6949
02:03:11,440 --> 02:03:14,229
so a robot would be capable of
extreme generalization if let's say it's

6950
02:03:14,229 --> 02:03:14,239
extreme generalization if let's say it's
 

6951
02:03:14,239 --> 02:03:15,830
extreme generalization if let's say it's
designed and trained

6952
02:03:15,830 --> 02:03:15,840
designed and trained
 

6953
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:19,109
designed and trained
uh to to for cooking for instance

6954
02:03:19,109 --> 02:03:19,119
uh to to for cooking for instance
 

6955
02:03:19,119 --> 02:03:22,390
uh to to for cooking for instance
um and if i if i buy the robot

6956
02:03:22,390 --> 02:03:22,400
um and if i if i buy the robot
 

6957
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:25,750
um and if i if i buy the robot
and if i'm able uh if it's able uh to

6958
02:03:25,750 --> 02:03:25,760
and if i'm able uh if it's able uh to
 

6959
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:26,629
and if i'm able uh if it's able uh to
teach itself

6960
02:03:26,629 --> 02:03:26,639
teach itself
 

6961
02:03:26,639 --> 02:03:29,030
teach itself
gardening in in a couple weeks it would

6962
02:03:29,030 --> 02:03:29,040
gardening in in a couple weeks it would
 

6963
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:29,910
gardening in in a couple weeks it would
be capable

6964
02:03:29,910 --> 02:03:29,920
be capable
 

6965
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:32,070
be capable
of extreme generalization for instance

6966
02:03:32,070 --> 02:03:32,080
of extreme generalization for instance
 

6967
02:03:32,080 --> 02:03:33,589
of extreme generalization for instance
so the ultimate goal is extreme

6968
02:03:33,589 --> 02:03:33,599
so the ultimate goal is extreme
 

6969
02:03:33,599 --> 02:03:34,790
so the ultimate goal is extreme
generalization yes

6970
02:03:34,790 --> 02:03:34,800
generalization yes
 

6971
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:37,910
generalization yes
so be uh creating a system that is

6972
02:03:37,910 --> 02:03:37,920
so be uh creating a system that is
 

6973
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:40,950
so be uh creating a system that is
so general that it could essentially

6974
02:03:40,950 --> 02:03:40,960
so general that it could essentially
 

6975
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:44,950
so general that it could essentially
achieve a human skill parity over

6976
02:03:44,950 --> 02:03:44,960
achieve a human skill parity over
 

6977
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:47,669
achieve a human skill parity over
arbitrary tasks and arbitrary domains

6978
02:03:47,669 --> 02:03:47,679
arbitrary tasks and arbitrary domains
 

6979
02:03:47,679 --> 02:03:49,750

when it encounters new situations and it

6986
02:03:55,589 --> 02:03:55,599
when it encounters new situations and it
 

6987
02:03:55,599 --> 02:03:56,790
when it encounters new situations and it
would do so

6988
02:03:56,790 --> 02:03:56,800
would do so
 

6989
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:59,830
would do so
uh over basically the same range of

6999
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:09,750

that will be human level extreme

7000
02:04:09,750 --> 02:04:09,760
that will be human level extreme
 

7001
02:04:09,760 --> 02:04:10,790

7003
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:14,069

so i i don't actually think humans are

7004
02:04:14,069 --> 02:04:14,079
so i i don't actually think humans are
 

7005
02:04:14,079 --> 02:04:17,990
so i i don't actually think humans are
anywhere near the uh

7006
02:04:17,990 --> 02:04:18,000
anywhere near the uh
 

7007
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,830
anywhere near the uh
optimal intelligence bound if there is

7008
02:04:19,830 --> 02:04:19,840
optimal intelligence bound if there is
 

7009
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:21,189
optimal intelligence bound if there is
such a thing

7010
02:04:21,189 --> 02:04:21,199
such a thing
 

7011
02:04:21,199 --> 02:04:23,830
such a thing
so i think for humans or in general in

7012
02:04:23,830 --> 02:04:23,840
so i think for humans or in general in
 

7013
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:24,950
so i think for humans or in general in
general

7014
02:04:24,950 --> 02:04:24,960
general
 

7015
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:26,470

i think it's quite likely you know that

7016
02:04:26,470 --> 02:04:26,480
i think it's quite likely you know that
 

7017
02:04:26,480 --> 02:04:28,870
i think it's quite likely you know that
there is an

7018
02:04:28,870 --> 02:04:28,880
there is an
 

7019
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:32,790
there is an
a hard limit to how intelligent

7020
02:04:32,790 --> 02:04:32,800
a hard limit to how intelligent
 

7021
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:34,550
a hard limit to how intelligent
any system can be but at the same time i

7022
02:04:34,550 --> 02:04:34,560
any system can be but at the same time i
 

7023
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:36,310
any system can be but at the same time i
don't think humans are anywhere near

7024
02:04:36,310 --> 02:04:36,320
don't think humans are anywhere near
 

7025
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:39,109
don't think humans are anywhere near
that limit

7026
02:04:39,109 --> 02:04:39,119
that limit
 

7027
02:04:39,119 --> 02:04:40,870
that limit
yeah last time i think we talked i think

7028
02:04:40,870 --> 02:04:40,880
yeah last time i think we talked i think
 

7029
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:42,229
yeah last time i think we talked i think
you had this idea that

7030
02:04:42,229 --> 02:04:42,239
you had this idea that
 

7031
02:04:42,239 --> 02:04:44,790
you had this idea that
uh we're only as intelligent as the

7032
02:04:44,790 --> 02:04:44,800
uh we're only as intelligent as the
 

7033
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:46,550
uh we're only as intelligent as the
problems we face

7034
02:04:46,550 --> 02:04:46,560
problems we face
 

7035
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:50,229
problems we face
sort of uh yes we are upper bounded by

7036
02:04:50,229 --> 02:04:50,239
sort of uh yes we are upper bounded by
 

7037
02:04:50,239 --> 02:04:51,189
sort of uh yes we are upper bounded by
the problem so

7038
02:04:51,189 --> 02:04:51,199
the problem so
 

7039
02:04:51,199 --> 02:04:53,750
the problem so
in a way yes we are we are bounded by on

7040
02:04:53,750 --> 02:04:53,760
in a way yes we are we are bounded by on
 

7041
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:55,030
in a way yes we are we are bounded by on
our environments

7042
02:04:55,030 --> 02:04:55,040
our environments
 

7043
02:04:55,040 --> 02:04:56,790
our environments
and we are bounded by the problems we

7044
02:04:56,790 --> 02:04:56,800
and we are bounded by the problems we
 

7045
02:04:56,800 --> 02:04:58,069
and we are bounded by the problems we
try to solve

7046
02:04:58,069 --> 02:04:58,079
try to solve
 

7047
02:04:58,079 --> 02:05:01,030

yeah yeah what do you make of neuralink

7048
02:05:01,030 --> 02:05:01,040
yeah yeah what do you make of neuralink
 

7049
02:05:01,040 --> 02:05:01,350
yeah yeah what do you make of neuralink
and

7050
02:05:01,350 --> 02:05:01,360
and
 

7051
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:04,550
and
uh outsourcing some of the

7052
02:05:04,550 --> 02:05:04,560
uh outsourcing some of the
 

7053
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:06,310
uh outsourcing some of the
brain power like bring computer

7054
02:05:06,310 --> 02:05:06,320
brain power like bring computer
 

7055
02:05:06,320 --> 02:05:09,109
brain power like bring computer
interfaces do you think we can expand

7056
02:05:09,109 --> 02:05:09,119
interfaces do you think we can expand
 

7057
02:05:09,119 --> 02:05:13,430
interfaces do you think we can expand
our augment our intelligence

7058
02:05:13,430 --> 02:05:13,440
our augment our intelligence
 

7059
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:16,470
our augment our intelligence
i am fairly skeptical

7060
02:05:16,470 --> 02:05:16,480
i am fairly skeptical
 

7061
02:05:16,480 --> 02:05:19,669
i am fairly skeptical
of neural interfaces because they are

7062
02:05:19,669 --> 02:05:19,679
of neural interfaces because they are
 

7063
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:20,229
of neural interfaces because they are
trying

02:05:20,229 --> 02:05:20,239
trying
 

7065
02:05:20,239 --> 02:05:23,830
trying
to fix one specific bottleneck

7066
02:05:23,830 --> 02:05:23,840
to fix one specific bottleneck
 

7067
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:27,030
to fix one specific bottleneck
in in human machine cognition which is

7068
02:05:27,030 --> 02:05:27,040
in in human machine cognition which is
 

7069
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:29,270
in in human machine cognition which is
the bandwidth bottleneck input and

7070
02:05:29,270 --> 02:05:29,280
the bandwidth bottleneck input and
 

7071
02:05:29,280 --> 02:05:30,629
the bandwidth bottleneck input and
output of information

7072
02:05:30,629 --> 02:05:30,639
output of information
 

7073
02:05:30,639 --> 02:05:34,390
output of information
in the brain and my perception

02:05:34,390 --> 02:05:34,400
in the brain and my perception
 

7075
02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:37,750
in the brain and my perception
of the problem is that bandwidth is not

7076
02:05:37,750 --> 02:05:37,760
of the problem is that bandwidth is not
 

7077
02:05:37,760 --> 02:05:41,030
of the problem is that bandwidth is not
at this time a bottleneck at all

7078
02:05:41,030 --> 02:05:41,040
at this time a bottleneck at all
 

7079
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:43,430
at this time a bottleneck at all
meaning that we already have sensors

7080
02:05:43,430 --> 02:05:43,440
meaning that we already have sensors
 

7081
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:44,790
meaning that we already have sensors
that enable us to

that enable us to
 

7083
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:47,990
that enable us to
to take in far more information than

to take in far more information than
 

7085

02:05:48,639 --> 02:05:51,510
what we can
actually process well to push back on

uh brain computer interfaces right but

7118
02:06:24,390 --> 02:06:24,400
uh brain computer interfaces right but
 

7119
02:06:24,400 --> 02:06:25,430
uh brain computer interfaces right but
the question is

7120
02:06:25,430 --> 02:06:25,440
the question is
 

7121
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:28,550
the question is
whether if we have direct access if our

7122
02:06:28,550 --> 02:06:28,560
whether if we have direct access if our
 

7123
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:30,470
whether if we have direct access if our
brain has direct access

7124
02:06:30,470 --> 02:06:30,480
brain has direct access
 

7125
02:06:30,480 --> 02:06:32,870
brain has direct access
to wikipedia with our brain already has

it's on your phone and you have your

7130
02:06:36,790 --> 02:06:36,800
it's on your phone and you have your
 

7131
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:38,390
it's on your phone and you have your
hands and your eyes

7132

hands and your eyes
 

7133
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:41,350
hands and your eyes
and your ears and so on uh to access

7134
02:06:41,350 --> 02:06:41,360
and your ears and so on uh to access
 

7135
02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:42,950
and your ears and so on uh to access
that information and the speed at which

7136
02:06:42,950 --> 02:06:42,960
that information and the speed at which
 

7137
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:44,310
that information and the speed at which
you can access it

7138
02:06:44,310 --> 02:06:44,320
you can access it
 

7139
02:06:44,320 --> 02:06:45,990
you can access it
is bottlenecked by the customer i think

7140
02:06:45,990 --> 02:06:46,000
is bottlenecked by the customer i think
 

7141
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,069
is bottlenecked by the customer i think
it's already closed

7142
02:06:48,069 --> 02:06:48,079
it's already closed
 

7143
02:06:48,079 --> 02:06:50,149
it's already closed
fairly close to optimal which is why

7144
02:06:50,149 --> 02:06:50,159
fairly close to optimal which is why
 

7145
02:06:50,159 --> 02:06:51,750
fairly close to optimal which is why
speed reading for instance

7146
02:06:51,750 --> 02:06:51,760
speed reading for instance
 

7147
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:54,470
speed reading for instance
does not work yeah the faster you read

7148
02:06:54,470 --> 02:06:54,480
does not work yeah the faster you read
 

7149
02:06:54,480 --> 02:06:55,910
does not work yeah the faster you read
the less you understand

7150
02:06:55,910 --> 02:06:55,920
the less you understand
 

7151
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:58,310
the less you understand
but maybe it's because it uses the eyes

7152
02:06:58,310 --> 02:06:58,320
but maybe it's because it uses the eyes
 

7153
02:06:58,320 --> 02:06:59,830
but maybe it's because it uses the eyes
so maybe

7154
02:06:59,830 --> 02:06:59,840
so maybe
 

7155
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:01,750
so maybe
um so i don't believe so i think you

7156
02:07:01,750 --> 02:07:01,760
um so i don't believe so i think you
 

7157
02:07:01,760 --> 02:07:03,990
um so i don't believe so i think you
know the brain is very slow

7158
02:07:03,990 --> 02:07:04,000
know the brain is very slow
 

7159
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,870
know the brain is very slow
um it typically operates you know the

7160
02:07:06,870 --> 02:07:06,880
um it typically operates you know the
 

7161
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:07,510
um it typically operates you know the
fastest

7162
02:07:07,510 --> 02:07:07,520
fastest
 

7163
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:08,870
fastest
things that happen in the brain at the

7164
02:07:08,870 --> 02:07:08,880
things that happen in the brain at the
 

7165
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:10,870
things that happen in the brain at the
level of 50 milliseconds

7166
02:07:10,870 --> 02:07:10,880
level of 50 milliseconds
 

7167
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:13,990
level of 50 milliseconds
uh forming a conscious out can

7168
02:07:13,990 --> 02:07:14,000
uh forming a conscious out can
 

7169
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:14,870
uh forming a conscious out can
potentially take

7170
02:07:14,870 --> 02:07:14,880
potentially take
 

7171
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:17,669
potentially take
entire seconds right and you can already

7172
02:07:17,669 --> 02:07:17,679
entire seconds right and you can already
 

7173
02:07:17,679 --> 02:07:18,950
entire seconds right and you can already
read pretty fast

7174
02:07:18,950 --> 02:07:18,960
read pretty fast
 

7175
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:21,830
read pretty fast
so i think the speed at which you can

7176
02:07:21,830 --> 02:07:21,840
so i think the speed at which you can
 

7177
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:23,030
so i think the speed at which you can
take information

7178
02:07:23,030 --> 02:07:23,040
take information
 

7179
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:25,109
take information
in and even the speed at which you can

7180
02:07:25,109 --> 02:07:25,119
in and even the speed at which you can
 

7181
02:07:25,119 --> 02:07:26,390
in and even the speed at which you can
add with information

7182
02:07:26,390 --> 02:07:26,400
add with information
 

7183
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:29,830
add with information
can only be very incrementally improved

7184
02:07:29,830 --> 02:07:29,840
can only be very incrementally improved
 

7185
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:32,229
can only be very incrementally improved
maybe i think if you're a very fast

7186
02:07:32,229 --> 02:07:32,239
maybe i think if you're a very fast
 

7187
02:07:32,239 --> 02:07:34,310
maybe i think if you're a very fast
typer if you're a very trained typer

7188
02:07:34,310 --> 02:07:34,320
typer if you're a very trained typer
 

7189
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:35,990
typer if you're a very trained typer
the speed at which you can express your

7190
02:07:35,990 --> 02:07:36,000
the speed at which you can express your
 

7191
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,069
the speed at which you can express your
thoughts is already a speed

7192
02:07:38,069 --> 02:07:38,079
thoughts is already a speed
 

7193
02:07:38,079 --> 02:07:40,470
thoughts is already a speed
at which you can form your thoughts

7194
02:07:40,470 --> 02:07:40,480
at which you can form your thoughts
 

7195
02:07:40,480 --> 02:07:44,069
at which you can form your thoughts
right so that's kind of an idea that

7196
02:07:44,069 --> 02:07:44,079
right so that's kind of an idea that
 

7197
02:07:44,079 --> 02:07:46,390
right so that's kind of an idea that
there are fundamental bottlenecks to the

7198
02:07:46,390 --> 02:07:46,400
there are fundamental bottlenecks to the
 

7199
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:48,229
there are fundamental bottlenecks to the
human mind but it's possible

7200
02:07:48,229 --> 02:07:48,239
human mind but it's possible
 

7201
02:07:48,239 --> 02:07:50,790
human mind but it's possible
that the everything we have in the human

7202
02:07:50,790 --> 02:07:50,800
that the everything we have in the human
 

7203
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:51,589
that the everything we have in the human
mind

7204
02:07:51,589 --> 02:07:51,599
mind
 

7205
02:07:51,599 --> 02:07:53,350
mind
is just to be able to survive in the

7206
02:07:53,350 --> 02:07:53,360
is just to be able to survive in the
 

7207
02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:56,149
is just to be able to survive in the
environment and

7208
02:07:56,149 --> 02:07:56,159
environment and
 

7209
02:07:56,159 --> 02:07:59,830
environment and
there's a lot more to expand maybe

7210
02:07:59,830 --> 02:07:59,840
there's a lot more to expand maybe
 

7211
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:01,750
there's a lot more to expand maybe
you know you said this the speed of the

7212
02:08:01,750 --> 02:08:01,760
you know you said this the speed of the
 

7213
02:08:01,760 --> 02:08:04,790
you know you said this the speed of the
thought so yeah i i think

7214
02:08:04,790 --> 02:08:04,800
thought so yeah i i think
 

7215
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:07,510
thought so yeah i i think
augmenting human intelligence is a very

7216
02:08:07,510 --> 02:08:07,520
augmenting human intelligence is a very
 

7217
02:08:07,520 --> 02:08:08,069
augmenting human intelligence is a very
valid

7218
02:08:08,069 --> 02:08:08,079
valid
 

7219
02:08:08,079 --> 02:08:09,990
valid
and very powerful avenue right and

7220
02:08:09,990 --> 02:08:10,000
and very powerful avenue right and
 

7221
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,589
and very powerful avenue right and
that's what computers

7222
02:08:11,589 --> 02:08:11,599
that's what computers
 

7223
02:08:11,599 --> 02:08:13,589
that's what computers
are about in fact that's what you know

7224
02:08:13,589 --> 02:08:13,599
are about in fact that's what you know
 

7225
02:08:13,599 --> 02:08:14,950
are about in fact that's what you know
all of culture

7226
02:08:14,950 --> 02:08:14,960
all of culture
 

7227
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:17,510
all of culture
and civilization is about they are

7228
02:08:17,510 --> 02:08:17,520
and civilization is about they are
 

7229
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:18,149
and civilization is about they are
culture

7230
02:08:18,149 --> 02:08:18,159
culture
 

7231
02:08:18,159 --> 02:08:21,589
culture
is externalized cognition and we rely on

7232
02:08:21,589 --> 02:08:21,599
is externalized cognition and we rely on
 

7233
02:08:21,599 --> 02:08:22,149
is externalized cognition and we rely on
culture

7234
02:08:22,149 --> 02:08:22,159
culture
 

7235
02:08:22,159 --> 02:08:25,030
culture
to think constantly yeah yeah i mean

7236
02:08:25,030 --> 02:08:25,040
to think constantly yeah yeah i mean
 

7237
02:08:25,040 --> 02:08:25,990
to think constantly yeah yeah i mean
that's that's another

7238
02:08:25,990 --> 02:08:26,000
that's that's another
 

7239
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:27,910
that's that's another
yeah that's not just not just computers

7240
02:08:27,910 --> 02:08:27,920
yeah that's not just not just computers
 

7241
02:08:27,920 --> 02:08:29,830
yeah that's not just not just computers
not just phones and the internet i mean

7242
02:08:29,830 --> 02:08:29,840
not just phones and the internet i mean
 

7243
02:08:29,840 --> 02:08:31,830
not just phones and the internet i mean
all of culture like language for

7244
02:08:31,830 --> 02:08:31,840
all of culture like language for
 

7245
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:33,430
all of culture like language for
instance is a form of external

7246
02:08:33,430 --> 02:08:33,440
instance is a form of external
 

7247
02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:35,669
instance is a form of external
recognition books are obviously

7248
02:08:35,669 --> 02:08:35,679
recognition books are obviously
 

7249
02:08:35,679 --> 02:08:38,229
recognition books are obviously
external recognition yeah that's right

7250
02:08:38,229 --> 02:08:38,239
external recognition yeah that's right
 

7251
02:08:38,239 --> 02:08:40,390
external recognition yeah that's right
and you you can scale

7252
02:08:40,390 --> 02:08:40,400
and you you can scale
 

7253
02:08:40,400 --> 02:08:42,390
and you you can scale
that external exclamation you know far

7254
02:08:42,390 --> 02:08:42,400
that external exclamation you know far
 

7255
02:08:42,400 --> 02:08:44,149
that external exclamation you know far
beyond the capability

7256
02:08:44,149 --> 02:08:44,159
beyond the capability
 

7257
02:08:44,159 --> 02:08:46,310
beyond the capability
of the human brain and you could see you

7258
02:08:46,310 --> 02:08:46,320
of the human brain and you could see you
 

7259
02:08:46,320 --> 02:08:47,189
of the human brain and you could see you
know civ

7260
02:08:47,189 --> 02:08:47,199
know civ
 

7261
02:08:47,199 --> 02:08:50,790
know civ
civilization itself is um

7262
02:08:50,790 --> 02:08:50,800
civilization itself is um
 

7263
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:52,870
civilization itself is um
it has capabilities that are far beyond

7264
02:08:52,870 --> 02:08:52,880
it has capabilities that are far beyond
 

7265
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:54,229
it has capabilities that are far beyond
any individual brain

7266
02:08:54,229 --> 02:08:54,239
any individual brain
 

7267
02:08:54,239 --> 02:08:55,669
any individual brain
and will keep scaling it because it's

7268
02:08:55,669 --> 02:08:55,679
and will keep scaling it because it's
 

7269
02:08:55,679 --> 02:08:59,109
and will keep scaling it because it's
not rebound by individual brains

7270
02:08:59,109 --> 02:08:59,119
not rebound by individual brains
 

7271
02:08:59,119 --> 02:09:02,229
not rebound by individual brains
it's a different kind of system yeah and

7272
02:09:02,229 --> 02:09:02,239
it's a different kind of system yeah and
 

7273
02:09:02,239 --> 02:09:05,589
it's a different kind of system yeah and
and that system includes non-human

7274
02:09:05,589 --> 02:09:05,599
and that system includes non-human
 

7275
02:09:05,599 --> 02:09:07,510
and that system includes non-human
non-humans first of all includes all the

7276
02:09:07,510 --> 02:09:07,520
non-humans first of all includes all the
 

7277
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:09,270
non-humans first of all includes all the
other biological systems which are

7278
02:09:09,270 --> 02:09:09,280
other biological systems which are
 

7279
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:11,030
other biological systems which are
probably contributing to the overall

7280
02:09:11,030 --> 02:09:11,040
probably contributing to the overall
 

7281
02:09:11,040 --> 02:09:12,870
probably contributing to the overall
intelligence of the organism

7282
02:09:12,870 --> 02:09:12,880
intelligence of the organism
 

7283
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:14,390
intelligence of the organism
and then yeah computers are part of it

7284
02:09:14,390 --> 02:09:14,400
and then yeah computers are part of it
 

7285
02:09:14,400 --> 02:09:15,990
and then yeah computers are part of it
no non-human systems probably not

7286
02:09:15,990 --> 02:09:16,000
no non-human systems probably not
 

7287
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:17,510
no non-human systems probably not
contributing much but

7288
02:09:17,510 --> 02:09:17,520
contributing much but
 

7289
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:19,669
contributing much but
ais are definitely contributing to that

7290
02:09:19,669 --> 02:09:19,679
ais are definitely contributing to that
 

7291
02:09:19,679 --> 02:09:21,109
ais are definitely contributing to that
like google search for instance

7292
02:09:21,109 --> 02:09:21,119
like google search for instance
 

7293
02:09:21,119 --> 02:09:24,310
like google search for instance
big part of it

7294
02:09:24,310 --> 02:09:24,320

 

7295
02:09:24,320 --> 02:09:28,229

yeah yeah a huge part

7296
02:09:28,229 --> 02:09:28,239
yeah yeah a huge part
 

7297
02:09:28,239 --> 02:09:31,270
yeah yeah a huge part
a part we can probably introspect like

7298
02:09:31,270 --> 02:09:31,280
a part we can probably introspect like
 

7299
02:09:31,280 --> 02:09:32,950
a part we can probably introspect like
how the world has changed in the past 20

7300
02:09:32,950 --> 02:09:32,960
how the world has changed in the past 20
 

7301
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:33,669
how the world has changed in the past 20
years

7302
02:09:33,669 --> 02:09:33,679
years
 

7303
02:09:33,679 --> 02:09:35,270
years
it's probably very difficult for us to

7304
02:09:35,270 --> 02:09:35,280
it's probably very difficult for us to
 

7305
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:37,030
it's probably very difficult for us to
be able to understand

7306
02:09:37,030 --> 02:09:37,040
be able to understand
 

7307
02:09:37,040 --> 02:09:39,669
be able to understand
until of course whoever created the

7308
02:09:39,669 --> 02:09:39,679
until of course whoever created the
 

7309
02:09:39,679 --> 02:09:41,109
until of course whoever created the
simulation we're in is

7310
02:09:41,109 --> 02:09:41,119
simulation we're in is
 

7311
02:09:41,119 --> 02:09:43,270
simulation we're in is
probably doing metrics measuring the

7312
02:09:43,270 --> 02:09:43,280
probably doing metrics measuring the
 

7313
02:09:43,280 --> 02:09:44,790
probably doing metrics measuring the
progress

7314
02:09:44,790 --> 02:09:44,800
progress
 

7315
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:46,390
progress
there was probably a big spike in

7316
02:09:46,390 --> 02:09:46,400
there was probably a big spike in
 

7317
02:09:46,400 --> 02:09:47,910
there was probably a big spike in
performance

7318
02:09:47,910 --> 02:09:47,920
performance
 

7319
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:49,910
performance
uh they're enjoying they're enjoying

7320
02:09:49,910 --> 02:09:49,920
uh they're enjoying they're enjoying
 

7321
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:51,589
uh they're enjoying they're enjoying
this

7322
02:09:51,589 --> 02:09:51,599
this
 

7323
02:09:51,599 --> 02:09:54,950
this
so what are your thoughts on um

7324
02:09:54,950 --> 02:09:54,960
so what are your thoughts on um
 

7325
02:09:54,960 --> 02:09:57,270
so what are your thoughts on um
the touring test and the lobner prize

7326
02:09:57,270 --> 02:09:57,280
the touring test and the lobner prize
 

7327
02:09:57,280 --> 02:09:59,270
the touring test and the lobner prize
which is the

7328
02:09:59,270 --> 02:09:59,280
which is the
 

7329
02:09:59,280 --> 02:10:02,229
which is the
you know one of the most famous attempts

7330
02:10:02,229 --> 02:10:02,239
you know one of the most famous attempts
 

7331
02:10:02,239 --> 02:10:04,149
you know one of the most famous attempts
at the test of human intelligence

7332
02:10:04,149 --> 02:10:04,159
at the test of human intelligence
 

7333
02:10:04,159 --> 02:10:07,189
at the test of human intelligence
uh sorry of artificial intelligence

7334
02:10:07,189 --> 02:10:07,199
uh sorry of artificial intelligence
 

7335
02:10:07,199 --> 02:10:09,669
uh sorry of artificial intelligence
by uh doing a natural language open

7336
02:10:09,669 --> 02:10:09,679
by uh doing a natural language open
 

7337
02:10:09,679 --> 02:10:11,189
by uh doing a natural language open
dialogue

7338
02:10:11,189 --> 02:10:11,199
dialogue
 

7339
02:10:11,199 --> 02:10:14,310
dialogue
test that's test that's uh

7340
02:10:14,310 --> 02:10:14,320
test that's test that's uh
 

7341
02:10:14,320 --> 02:10:16,950
test that's test that's uh
judged by humans as far as how well the

7342
02:10:16,950 --> 02:10:16,960
judged by humans as far as how well the
 

7343
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:18,790
judged by humans as far as how well the
machine did

7344
02:10:18,790 --> 02:10:18,800
machine did
 

7345
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:21,430
machine did
so i'm not a fan of the chewing test

7346
02:10:21,430 --> 02:10:21,440
so i'm not a fan of the chewing test
 

7347
02:10:21,440 --> 02:10:21,990
so i'm not a fan of the chewing test
itself

7348
02:10:21,990 --> 02:10:22,000
itself
 

7349
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:25,830
itself
or any of its variants for two reasons

7350
02:10:25,830 --> 02:10:25,840
or any of its variants for two reasons
 

7351
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:30,709
or any of its variants for two reasons
so first of all it's um

7352
02:10:30,709 --> 02:10:30,719
so first of all it's um
 

7353
02:10:30,719 --> 02:10:34,069
so first of all it's um
it's really copping out

7354
02:10:34,069 --> 02:10:34,079
it's really copping out
 

7355
02:10:34,079 --> 02:10:36,950
it's really copping out
of trying to define and measure

7356
02:10:36,950 --> 02:10:36,960
of trying to define and measure
 

7357
02:10:36,960 --> 02:10:39,030
of trying to define and measure
intelligence because it's entirely

7358
02:10:39,030 --> 02:10:39,040
intelligence because it's entirely
 

7359
02:10:39,040 --> 02:10:42,229
intelligence because it's entirely
outsourcing that to a panel

7360
02:10:42,229 --> 02:10:42,239
outsourcing that to a panel
 

7361
02:10:42,239 --> 02:10:45,830
outsourcing that to a panel

one of the core psychometrics principles
 

7377
02:10:59,280 --> 02:11:01,669
one of the core psychometrics principles
which is reliability because you have

02:11:01,669 --> 02:11:01,679
which is reliability because you have
 

7379
02:11:01,679 --> 02:11:05,030
which is reliability because you have
biased human judges uh it's also

02:11:05,030 --> 02:11:05,040
biased human judges uh it's also
 

7381
02:11:05,040 --> 02:11:05,910
biased human judges uh it's also
violating the

people
like this it is very very short i so

7592
02:14:44,709 --> 02:14:44,719
like this it is very very short i so
 

7593
02:14:44,719 --> 02:14:45,750
like this it is very very short i so
totally disagree with that

7594

totally disagree with that
 

7595
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:48,790
totally disagree with that
you brilliantly put there's a huge it's

the anthropomorphization that we

7600
02:14:50,709 --> 02:14:50,719
the anthropomorphization that we
 

7601
02:14:50,719 --> 02:14:52,550
the anthropomorphization that we
naturally do the agentness

7602
02:14:52,550 --> 02:14:52,560
naturally do the agentness
 

7603
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:54,550

of that word is that real word but no

7604
02:14:54,550 --> 02:14:54,560
of that word is that real word but no
 

7605
02:14:54,560 --> 02:14:56,149
of that word is that real word but no
it's not a real word i like it but it's

7606

it's not a real word i like it but it's
 

7607
02:14:56,159 --> 02:14:57,030
it's not a real word i like it but it's
exactly why it's

7608
02:14:57,030 --> 02:14:57,040
exactly why it's
 

7609
02:14:57,040 --> 02:14:58,709
exactly why it's
useful well it's a useful word let's

7610
02:14:58,709 --> 02:14:58,719
useful well it's a useful word let's
 

7611
02:14:58,719 --> 02:15:00,870
useful well it's a useful word let's
make it real it's a huge help

7612
02:15:00,870 --> 02:15:00,880
make it real it's a huge help
 

7613
02:15:00,880 --> 02:15:02,550
make it real it's a huge help
but i still think it's really difficult

7614
02:15:02,550 --> 02:15:02,560
but i still think it's really difficult
 

7615
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:04,870
but i still think it's really difficult
to convince uh

7616
02:15:04,870 --> 02:15:04,880
to convince uh
 

7617
02:15:04,880 --> 02:15:06,830
to convince uh
if you do like the alexa prize

7618
02:15:06,830 --> 02:15:06,840
if you do like the alexa prize
 

7619
02:15:06,840 --> 02:15:09,030
if you do like the alexa prize
formulation where you know you talk for

7620
02:15:09,030 --> 02:15:09,040
formulation where you know you talk for
 

7621
02:15:09,040 --> 02:15:09,830
formulation where you know you talk for
an hour

7622
02:15:09,830 --> 02:15:09,840
an hour
 

7623
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:11,510
an hour
like there's formulations of the test

7624
02:15:11,510 --> 02:15:11,520
like there's formulations of the test
 

7625
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:13,669
like there's formulations of the test
you can create where it's very difficult

7626
02:15:13,669 --> 02:15:13,679
you can create where it's very difficult
 

7627
02:15:13,679 --> 02:15:16,229
you can create where it's very difficult
so i like i like the extra price better

7628
02:15:16,229 --> 02:15:16,239
so i like i like the extra price better
 

7629
02:15:16,239 --> 02:15:16,870
so i like i like the extra price better
because

7630
02:15:16,870 --> 02:15:16,880
because
 

7631
02:15:16,880 --> 02:15:19,510
because
it's more pragmatic it's more practical

7632
02:15:19,510 --> 02:15:19,520
it's more pragmatic it's more practical
 

7633
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:19,910
it's more pragmatic it's more practical
it's

7634
02:15:19,910 --> 02:15:19,920
it's
 

7635
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:22,149
it's
actually incentivizing developers to

7636
02:15:22,149 --> 02:15:22,159
actually incentivizing developers to
 

7637
02:15:22,159 --> 02:15:23,750
actually incentivizing developers to
create something that's useful

7638
02:15:23,750 --> 02:15:23,760
create something that's useful
 

7639
02:15:23,760 --> 02:15:27,430
create something that's useful
yeah as a as as a a human

7640
02:15:27,430 --> 02:15:27,440
yeah as a as as a a human
 

7641
02:15:27,440 --> 02:15:29,910
yeah as a as as a a human
machine interface uh so that's slightly

7642
02:15:29,910 --> 02:15:29,920
machine interface uh so that's slightly
 

7643
02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:30,629
machine interface uh so that's slightly
better

7644
02:15:30,629 --> 02:15:30,639
better
 

7645
02:15:30,639 --> 02:15:32,709
better
than just the imitation so i like your

7646
02:15:32,709 --> 02:15:32,719
than just the imitation so i like your
 

7647
02:15:32,719 --> 02:15:34,069
than just the imitation so i like your
your

7648
02:15:34,069 --> 02:15:34,079
your
 

7649
02:15:34,079 --> 02:15:36,950
your
your ideas like a test which hopefully

7650
02:15:36,950 --> 02:15:36,960
your ideas like a test which hopefully
 

7651
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:38,950
your ideas like a test which hopefully
help us in creating intelligent systems

7652
02:15:38,950 --> 02:15:38,960
help us in creating intelligent systems
 

7653
02:15:38,960 --> 02:15:40,550
help us in creating intelligent systems
as a result like if you create a system

7654
02:15:40,550 --> 02:15:40,560
as a result like if you create a system
 

7655
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:41,589
as a result like if you create a system
that passes it

7656
02:15:41,589 --> 02:15:41,599
that passes it
 

7657
02:15:41,599 --> 02:15:43,669
that passes it
it'll be useful for creating further

7658
02:15:43,669 --> 02:15:43,679
it'll be useful for creating further
 

7659
02:15:43,679 --> 02:15:44,709
it'll be useful for creating further
intelligence systems

7660
02:15:44,709 --> 02:15:44,719
intelligence systems
 

7661
02:15:44,719 --> 02:15:47,910
intelligence systems
yes at least yeah i mean i'm just to

7662
02:15:47,910 --> 02:15:47,920
yes at least yeah i mean i'm just to
 

7663
02:15:47,920 --> 02:15:48,470
yes at least yeah i mean i'm just to
kind of

7664
02:15:48,470 --> 02:15:48,480
kind of
 

7665
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:51,750
kind of
comment i'm a little bit surprised

7666
02:15:51,750 --> 02:15:51,760
comment i'm a little bit surprised
 

7667
02:15:51,760 --> 02:15:54,870
comment i'm a little bit surprised
how little inspiration people draw from

7668
02:15:54,870 --> 02:15:54,880
how little inspiration people draw from
 

7669
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:57,189
how little inspiration people draw from
the touring test today you know

7670
02:15:57,189 --> 02:15:57,199
the touring test today you know

the media and the popular press might

7672
02:15:58,790 --> 02:15:58,800
the media and the popular press might
 

7673
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:00,870
the media and the popular press might
write about it every once in a while

7674
02:16:00,870 --> 02:16:00,880
write about it every once in a while
 

7675
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:03,669
write about it every once in a while
the philosophers might talk about it but

7676
02:16:03,669 --> 02:16:03,679
the philosophers might talk about it but
 

7677
02:16:03,679 --> 02:16:04,069
the philosophers might talk about it but
like

7678
02:16:04,069 --> 02:16:04,079
like
 

7679
02:16:04,079 --> 02:16:06,310
like
most engineers are not really inspired

7680
02:16:06,310 --> 02:16:06,320
most engineers are not really inspired
 

7681
02:16:06,320 --> 02:16:07,830
most engineers are not really inspired
by it and

7682
02:16:07,830 --> 02:16:07,840
by it and
 

7683
02:16:07,840 --> 02:16:10,390
by it and
i know i know you don't like the touring

test
 

7687
02:16:11,360 --> 02:16:13,270
test
but uh we'll have this argument another

7688
02:16:13,270 --> 02:16:13,280
but uh we'll have this argument another
 

7689
02:16:13,280 --> 02:16:14,709
but uh we'll have this argument another
time you know

7690
02:16:14,709 --> 02:16:14,719
time you know
 

7691
02:16:14,719 --> 02:16:17,030
time you know
i there's something inspiring about it i

7692

i there's something inspiring about it i
 

7693
02:16:17,040 --> 02:16:18,550
i there's something inspiring about it i
think that

7694
02:16:18,550 --> 02:16:18,560
think that
 

7695
02:16:18,560 --> 02:16:20,709
think that
as as a philosophical device in a

7696
02:16:20,709 --> 02:16:20,719
as as a philosophical device in a
 

7697
02:16:20,719 --> 02:16:22,149
as as a philosophical device in a
physical discussion i think there is

7698
02:16:22,149 --> 02:16:22,159
physical discussion i think there is
 

7699
02:16:22,159 --> 02:16:23,830
physical discussion i think there is
something very interesting about it i

7700
02:16:23,830 --> 02:16:23,840
something very interesting about it i
 

7701
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:25,189
something very interesting about it i
don't think it is

7702
02:16:25,189 --> 02:16:25,199
don't think it is
 

7703
02:16:25,199 --> 02:16:26,790
don't think it is
in practical terms i don't think it's

7704
02:16:26,790 --> 02:16:26,800
in practical terms i don't think it's
 

7705
02:16:26,800 --> 02:16:29,030
in practical terms i don't think it's
it's conducive to to progress

7706
02:16:29,030 --> 02:16:29,040
it's conducive to to progress
 

7707
02:16:29,040 --> 02:16:31,589
it's conducive to to progress
and one of the reasons why is that you

7708
02:16:31,589 --> 02:16:31,599
and one of the reasons why is that you
 

7709
02:16:31,599 --> 02:16:32,309
and one of the reasons why is that you
know

7710
02:16:32,309 --> 02:16:32,319
know
 

7711
02:16:32,319 --> 02:16:35,270
know
i think being very human-like being

7712
02:16:35,270 --> 02:16:35,280
i think being very human-like being
 

7713
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:36,950
i think being very human-like being
indistinguishable from a human

7714
02:16:36,950 --> 02:16:36,960
indistinguishable from a human
 

7715
02:16:36,960 --> 02:16:39,589
indistinguishable from a human
is actually the very last step in the

7716
02:16:39,589 --> 02:16:39,599
is actually the very last step in the
 

7717
02:16:39,599 --> 02:16:41,110
is actually the very last step in the
creation of machine intelligence that

7718
02:16:41,110 --> 02:16:41,120
creation of machine intelligence that
 

7719
02:16:41,120 --> 02:16:42,150
creation of machine intelligence that
the first

7720
02:16:42,150 --> 02:16:42,160
the first
 

7721
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:46,230
the first
ais that will show strong generalization

7722
02:16:46,230 --> 02:16:46,240
ais that will show strong generalization
 

7723
02:16:46,240 --> 02:16:49,750
ais that will show strong generalization
uh uh in in uh that that will actually

7724
02:16:49,750 --> 02:16:49,760
uh uh in in uh that that will actually
 

7725
02:16:49,760 --> 02:16:52,389
uh uh in in uh that that will actually
uh implement human like broad cognitive

7726
02:16:52,389 --> 02:16:52,399
uh implement human like broad cognitive
 

7727
02:16:52,399 --> 02:16:53,030
uh implement human like broad cognitive
abilities

7728
02:16:53,030 --> 02:16:53,040
abilities
 

7729
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:54,950
abilities
they will not actually be able to look

7730
02:16:54,950 --> 02:16:54,960
they will not actually be able to look
 

7731
02:16:54,960 --> 02:16:56,070
they will not actually be able to look
anything

7732
02:16:56,070 --> 02:16:56,080
anything
 

7733
02:16:56,080 --> 02:16:59,509
anything
uh like humans human likeness is the

7734
02:16:59,509 --> 02:16:59,519
uh like humans human likeness is the
 

7735
02:16:59,519 --> 02:17:01,589
uh like humans human likeness is the
very last step in that process

7736
02:17:01,589 --> 02:17:01,599
very last step in that process
 

7737
02:17:01,599 --> 02:17:04,070
very last step in that process
and so a good test is a test that points

7738
02:17:04,070 --> 02:17:04,080
and so a good test is a test that points
 

7739
02:17:04,080 --> 02:17:06,070
and so a good test is a test that points
you towards the first step

7740
02:17:06,070 --> 02:17:06,080
you towards the first step
 

7741
02:17:06,080 --> 02:17:07,990
you towards the first step
uh on the ladder not towards the top of

7742
02:17:07,990 --> 02:17:08,000
uh on the ladder not towards the top of
 

7743
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:09,990
uh on the ladder not towards the top of
the ladder right yeah so to push back on

7744
02:17:09,990 --> 02:17:10,000
the ladder right yeah so to push back on
 

7745
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:11,190
the ladder right yeah so to push back on
that so i guess

7746
02:17:11,190 --> 02:17:11,200
that so i guess
 

7747
02:17:11,200 --> 02:17:13,349
that so i guess
i usually agree with you on most things

7748
02:17:13,349 --> 02:17:13,359
i usually agree with you on most things
 

7749
02:17:13,359 --> 02:17:14,950
i usually agree with you on most things
i remember you i think at some point

7750
02:17:14,950 --> 02:17:14,960
i remember you i think at some point
 

7751
02:17:14,960 --> 02:17:15,589
i remember you i think at some point
tweeting

7752
02:17:15,589 --> 02:17:15,599
tweeting
 

7753
02:17:15,599 --> 02:17:17,270
tweeting
something about the turing test not

7754
02:17:17,270 --> 02:17:17,280
something about the turing test not
 

7755
02:17:17,280 --> 02:17:19,030
something about the turing test not
being being counterproductive or

7756
02:17:19,030 --> 02:17:19,040
being being counterproductive or
 

7757
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:20,230
being being counterproductive or
something like that

7758
02:17:20,230 --> 02:17:20,240
something like that
 

7759
02:17:20,240 --> 02:17:21,910
something like that
and i think a lot of very smart people

7760
02:17:21,910 --> 02:17:21,920
and i think a lot of very smart people
 

7761
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:24,790
and i think a lot of very smart people
agree with that i

7762
02:17:24,790 --> 02:17:24,800
agree with that i
 

7763
02:17:24,800 --> 02:17:28,549
agree with that i
uh uh a uh you know uh

7764
02:17:28,549 --> 02:17:28,559
uh uh a uh you know uh
 

7765
02:17:28,559 --> 02:17:30,150
uh uh a uh you know uh
computation speaking not very smart

7766
02:17:30,150 --> 02:17:30,160
computation speaking not very smart
 

7767
02:17:30,160 --> 02:17:32,629
computation speaking not very smart
person uh disagree with that because i

7768
02:17:32,629 --> 02:17:32,639
person uh disagree with that because i
 

7769
02:17:32,639 --> 02:17:33,910
person uh disagree with that because i
think there's some magic to the

7770
02:17:33,910 --> 02:17:33,920
think there's some magic to the
 

7771
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:34,870
think there's some magic to the
interactivity

7772
02:17:34,870 --> 02:17:34,880
interactivity
 

7773
02:17:34,880 --> 02:17:37,190
interactivity
interactivity with other humans so to

7774
02:17:37,190 --> 02:17:37,200
interactivity with other humans so to
 

7775
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:39,110
interactivity with other humans so to
push to play devil's advocate on your

7776
02:17:39,110 --> 02:17:39,120
push to play devil's advocate on your
 

7777
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:39,589
push to play devil's advocate on your
statement

7778
02:17:39,589 --> 02:17:39,599
statement
 

7779
02:17:39,599 --> 02:17:42,070
statement
it's possible that in order to

7780
02:17:42,070 --> 02:17:42,080
it's possible that in order to
 

7781
02:17:42,080 --> 02:17:42,950
it's possible that in order to
demonstrate the

7782
02:17:42,950 --> 02:17:42,960
demonstrate the
 

7783
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:45,429
demonstrate the
the generalization abilities of a system

7784
02:17:45,429 --> 02:17:45,439
the generalization abilities of a system
 

7785
02:17:45,439 --> 02:17:47,910
the generalization abilities of a system
you have to

7786
02:17:47,910 --> 02:17:47,920
you have to
 

7787
02:17:47,920 --> 02:17:49,990
you have to
show your ability in conversation show

7788
02:17:49,990 --> 02:17:50,000
show your ability in conversation show
 

7789
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:51,750
show your ability in conversation show
your ability to

7790
02:17:51,750 --> 02:17:51,760
your ability to
 

7791
02:17:51,760 --> 02:17:55,349
your ability to
adjust adapt to the conversation

7792
02:17:55,349 --> 02:17:55,359
adjust adapt to the conversation
 

7793
02:17:55,359 --> 02:17:57,509
adjust adapt to the conversation
through not just like as a standalone

7794
02:17:57,509 --> 02:17:57,519
through not just like as a standalone
 

7795
02:17:57,519 --> 02:17:58,629
through not just like as a standalone
system but

7796
02:17:58,629 --> 02:17:58,639
system but
 

7797
02:17:58,639 --> 02:18:00,629
system but
through the process of like the

7798
02:18:00,629 --> 02:18:00,639
through the process of like the
 

7799
02:18:00,639 --> 02:18:02,790
through the process of like the
interaction like game theoretic

7800
02:18:02,790 --> 02:18:02,800
interaction like game theoretic
 

7801
02:18:02,800 --> 02:18:06,629
interaction like game theoretic
where you're you really are

7802
02:18:06,629 --> 02:18:06,639
where you're you really are
 

7803
02:18:06,639 --> 02:18:09,030
where you're you really are
changing the environment by your actions

7804
02:18:09,030 --> 02:18:09,040
changing the environment by your actions
 

7805
02:18:09,040 --> 02:18:11,589
changing the environment by your actions
so in the arc challenge for example

7806
02:18:11,589 --> 02:18:11,599
so in the arc challenge for example
 

7807
02:18:11,599 --> 02:18:14,230
so in the arc challenge for example
you're an observer you can't you can't

7808
02:18:14,230 --> 02:18:14,240
you're an observer you can't you can't
 

7809
02:18:14,240 --> 02:18:14,870
you're an observer you can't you can't
scare

7810
02:18:14,870 --> 02:18:14,880
scare
 

7811
02:18:14,880 --> 02:18:17,910
scare
the test into into changing you can't

7812
02:18:17,910 --> 02:18:17,920
the test into into changing you can't
 

7813
02:18:17,920 --> 02:18:19,270
the test into into changing you can't
talk to the test

7814
02:18:19,270 --> 02:18:19,280
talk to the test
 

7815
02:18:19,280 --> 02:18:21,990
talk to the test
you can't play with it so there's some

7816
02:18:21,990 --> 02:18:22,000
you can't play with it so there's some
 

7817
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,230
you can't play with it so there's some
aspect of that interactivity

7818
02:18:24,230 --> 02:18:24,240
aspect of that interactivity
 

7819
02:18:24,240 --> 02:18:26,230
aspect of that interactivity
that becomes highly subjective but it

7820
02:18:26,230 --> 02:18:26,240
that becomes highly subjective but it
 

7821
02:18:26,240 --> 02:18:28,230
that becomes highly subjective but it
feels like it could be conducive

7822
02:18:28,230 --> 02:18:28,240
feels like it could be conducive
 

7823
02:18:28,240 --> 02:18:30,549
feels like it could be conducive
to yeah generalization you make a great

7824
02:18:30,549 --> 02:18:30,559
to yeah generalization you make a great
 

7825
02:18:30,559 --> 02:18:32,070
to yeah generalization you make a great
point the interactivity

7826
02:18:32,070 --> 02:18:32,080
point the interactivity
 

7827
02:18:32,080 --> 02:18:34,070
point the interactivity
is a very good setting to force the

7828
02:18:34,070 --> 02:18:34,080
is a very good setting to force the
 

7829
02:18:34,080 --> 02:18:35,270
is a very good setting to force the
system to show

7830
02:18:35,270 --> 02:18:35,280
system to show
 

7831
02:18:35,280 --> 02:18:39,270
system to show
adaptation to shoot generalization uh

7832
02:18:39,270 --> 02:18:39,280
adaptation to shoot generalization uh
 

7833
02:18:39,280 --> 02:18:42,309
adaptation to shoot generalization uh
that that said you at the same time uh

7834
02:18:42,309 --> 02:18:42,319
that that said you at the same time uh
 

7835
02:18:42,319 --> 02:18:44,549
that that said you at the same time uh
it's not something very scalable because

7836
02:18:44,549 --> 02:18:44,559
it's not something very scalable because
 

7837
02:18:44,559 --> 02:18:46,070
it's not something very scalable because
you rely on human judges

7838
02:18:46,070 --> 02:18:46,080
you rely on human judges
 

7839
02:18:46,080 --> 02:18:47,750
you rely on human judges
it's not something reliable because the

7840
02:18:47,750 --> 02:18:47,760
it's not something reliable because the
 

7841
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:49,910
it's not something reliable because the
images may not may not so you don't like

7842
02:18:49,910 --> 02:18:49,920
images may not may not so you don't like
 

7843
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:50,950
images may not may not so you don't like
human judges

7844
02:18:50,950 --> 02:18:50,960
human judges
 

7845
02:18:50,960 --> 02:18:53,349
human judges
basically yes and i think so i i love

7846
02:18:53,349 --> 02:18:53,359
basically yes and i think so i i love
 

7847
02:18:53,359 --> 02:18:55,349
basically yes and i think so i i love
the idea of interactivity

7848
02:18:55,349 --> 02:18:55,359
the idea of interactivity
 

7849
02:18:55,359 --> 02:18:59,270
the idea of interactivity
um i initially wanted an arc test

7850
02:18:59,270 --> 02:18:59,280
um i initially wanted an arc test
 

7851
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:01,270
um i initially wanted an arc test
that had some amount of interactivity

7852
02:19:01,270 --> 02:19:01,280
that had some amount of interactivity
 

7853
02:19:01,280 --> 02:19:03,509
that had some amount of interactivity
where your score on a task would not be

7854
02:19:03,509 --> 02:19:03,519
where your score on a task would not be
 

7855
02:19:03,519 --> 02:19:05,270
where your score on a task would not be
one or zero if you can solve it or not

7856
02:19:05,270 --> 02:19:05,280
one or zero if you can solve it or not
 

7857
02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:07,270
one or zero if you can solve it or not
but would be the

7858
02:19:07,270 --> 02:19:07,280
but would be the
 

7859
02:19:07,280 --> 02:19:11,429
but would be the
number of attempts

7860
02:19:11,429 --> 02:19:11,439
number of attempts
 

7861
02:19:11,439 --> 02:19:12,950
number of attempts
that you can make before you hit the

7862
02:19:12,950 --> 02:19:12,960
that you can make before you hit the
 

7863
02:19:12,960 --> 02:19:14,709
that you can make before you hit the
right solution which

7864
02:19:14,709 --> 02:19:14,719
right solution which
 

7865
02:19:14,719 --> 02:19:16,790
right solution which
means that now you can start applying

7866
02:19:16,790 --> 02:19:16,800
means that now you can start applying
 

7867
02:19:16,800 --> 02:19:18,389
means that now you can start applying
the scientific method

7868
02:19:18,389 --> 02:19:18,399
the scientific method
 

7869
02:19:18,399 --> 02:19:20,230
the scientific method
as you solve our tasks that you can

7870
02:19:20,230 --> 02:19:20,240
as you solve our tasks that you can
 

7871
02:19:20,240 --> 02:19:22,230
as you solve our tasks that you can
start formulating hypothesis

7872
02:19:22,230 --> 02:19:22,240
start formulating hypothesis
 

7873
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:24,709
start formulating hypothesis
and and and probing the system to see

7874
02:19:24,709 --> 02:19:24,719
and and and probing the system to see
 

7875
02:19:24,719 --> 02:19:26,389
and and and probing the system to see
whether the hypothesis is

7876
02:19:26,389 --> 02:19:26,399
whether the hypothesis is
 

7877
02:19:26,399 --> 02:19:27,990
whether the hypothesis is
the observation will match the buddhists

7878
02:19:27,990 --> 02:19:28,000
the observation will match the buddhists
 

7879
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,150
the observation will match the buddhists
or not it would be amazing if you could

7880
02:19:30,150 --> 02:19:30,160
or not it would be amazing if you could
 

7881
02:19:30,160 --> 02:19:30,629
or not it would be amazing if you could
also

7882
02:19:30,629 --> 02:19:30,639
also
 

7883
02:19:30,639 --> 02:19:33,429
also
even higher level than that measure the

7884
02:19:33,429 --> 02:19:33,439
even higher level than that measure the
 

7885
02:19:33,439 --> 02:19:35,349
even higher level than that measure the
quality of your attempts

7886
02:19:35,349 --> 02:19:35,359
quality of your attempts
 

7887
02:19:35,359 --> 02:19:36,870
quality of your attempts
which of course is impossible but again

7888
02:19:36,870 --> 02:19:36,880
which of course is impossible but again
 

7889
02:19:36,880 --> 02:19:38,870
which of course is impossible but again
that's gets subjective yes like how good

7890
02:19:38,870 --> 02:19:38,880
that's gets subjective yes like how good
 

7891
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:40,070
that's gets subjective yes like how good
was your thinking

7892
02:19:40,070 --> 02:19:40,080
was your thinking
 

7893
02:19:40,080 --> 02:19:43,190
was your thinking
like it's yeah how efficient

7894
02:19:43,190 --> 02:19:43,200
like it's yeah how efficient
 

7895
02:19:43,200 --> 02:19:45,830
like it's yeah how efficient
was so one thing that's interesting

7896
02:19:45,830 --> 02:19:45,840
was so one thing that's interesting
 

7897
02:19:45,840 --> 02:19:47,349
was so one thing that's interesting
about this notion of

7898
02:19:47,349 --> 02:19:47,359
about this notion of
 

7899
02:19:47,359 --> 02:19:49,429
about this notion of
scoring you as how many attempts you

7900
02:19:49,429 --> 02:19:49,439
scoring you as how many attempts you
 

7901
02:19:49,439 --> 02:19:51,429
scoring you as how many attempts you
need is that you can start producing

7902
02:19:51,429 --> 02:19:51,439
need is that you can start producing
 

7903
02:19:51,439 --> 02:19:53,590
need is that you can start producing
tasks that are way more ambiguous

7904
02:19:53,590 --> 02:19:53,600
tasks that are way more ambiguous
 

7905
02:19:53,600 --> 02:19:57,190
tasks that are way more ambiguous
right right because

7906
02:19:57,190 --> 02:19:57,200
right right because
 

7907
02:19:57,200 --> 02:19:58,710
right right because
you can with the problem with the with

7908
02:19:58,710 --> 02:19:58,720
you can with the problem with the with
 

7909
02:19:58,720 --> 02:20:00,630
you can with the problem with the with
the different attempts you can actually

7910
02:20:00,630 --> 02:20:00,640
the different attempts you can actually
 

7911
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:04,070
the different attempts you can actually
probe that ambiguity right right

7912
02:20:04,070 --> 02:20:04,080
probe that ambiguity right right
 

7913
02:20:04,080 --> 02:20:07,190
probe that ambiguity right right
so that's in a sense which yeah so

7914
02:20:07,190 --> 02:20:07,200
so that's in a sense which yeah so
 

7915
02:20:07,200 --> 02:20:10,550
so that's in a sense which yeah so
it's how good can you adapt to the

7916
02:20:10,550 --> 02:20:10,560
it's how good can you adapt to the
 

7917
02:20:10,560 --> 02:20:12,230
it's how good can you adapt to the
uncertainty

7918
02:20:12,230 --> 02:20:12,240
uncertainty
 

7919
02:20:12,240 --> 02:20:16,070
uncertainty
and reduce the uncertainty yes

7920
02:20:16,070 --> 02:20:16,080
and reduce the uncertainty yes
 

7921
02:20:16,080 --> 02:20:19,190
and reduce the uncertainty yes
it's half fast with is the efficiency

7922
02:20:19,190 --> 02:20:19,200
it's half fast with is the efficiency
 

7923
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:21,110
it's half fast with is the efficiency
with which to reduce uncertainty

7924
02:20:21,110 --> 02:20:21,120
with which to reduce uncertainty
 

7925
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:23,190
with which to reduce uncertainty
in in program space exactly very

7926
02:20:23,190 --> 02:20:23,200
in in program space exactly very
 

7927
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:24,309
in in program space exactly very
difficult to come up with that kind of

7928
02:20:24,309 --> 02:20:24,319
difficult to come up with that kind of
 

7929
02:20:24,319 --> 02:20:25,910
difficult to come up with that kind of
test though yeah so

7930
02:20:25,910 --> 02:20:25,920
test though yeah so
 

7931
02:20:25,920 --> 02:20:27,590
test though yeah so
uh i would love to be able to create

7932
02:20:27,590 --> 02:20:27,600
uh i would love to be able to create
 

7933
02:20:27,600 --> 02:20:29,190
uh i would love to be able to create
something like this in practice

7934
02:20:29,190 --> 02:20:29,200
something like this in practice
 

7935
02:20:29,200 --> 02:20:30,710
something like this in practice
it would be it would be very very

7936
02:20:30,710 --> 02:20:30,720
it would be it would be very very
 

7937
02:20:30,720 --> 02:20:32,950
it would be it would be very very
difficult but yes but uh

7938
02:20:32,950 --> 02:20:32,960
difficult but yes but uh
 

7939
02:20:32,960 --> 02:20:34,550
difficult but yes but uh
i mean what you're doing what you've

7940
02:20:34,550 --> 02:20:34,560
i mean what you're doing what you've
 

7941
02:20:34,560 --> 02:20:35,990
i mean what you're doing what you've
done with the arc challenge is

7942
02:20:35,990 --> 02:20:36,000
done with the arc challenge is
 

7943
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,469
done with the arc challenge is
is uh brilliant i'm also not i'm

7944
02:20:38,469 --> 02:20:38,479
is uh brilliant i'm also not i'm
 

7945
02:20:38,479 --> 02:20:40,790
is uh brilliant i'm also not i'm
surprised that it's not more popular

7946
02:20:40,790 --> 02:20:40,800
surprised that it's not more popular
 

7947
02:20:40,800 --> 02:20:42,309
surprised that it's not more popular
but i think it's picking up what does it

7948
02:20:42,309 --> 02:20:42,319
but i think it's picking up what does it
 

7949
02:20:42,319 --> 02:20:43,990
but i think it's picking up what does it
snitch it does

7950
02:20:43,990 --> 02:20:44,000
snitch it does
 

7951
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:45,750
snitch it does
yeah what are your thoughts about

7952
02:20:45,750 --> 02:20:45,760
yeah what are your thoughts about
 

7953
02:20:45,760 --> 02:20:47,110
yeah what are your thoughts about
another test that

7954
02:20:47,110 --> 02:20:47,120
another test that
 

7955
02:20:47,120 --> 02:20:49,110
another test that
talks with marcus hutter he has the

7956
02:20:49,110 --> 02:20:49,120
talks with marcus hutter he has the
 

7957
02:20:49,120 --> 02:20:50,309
talks with marcus hutter he has the
harder prize for

7958
02:20:50,309 --> 02:20:50,319
harder prize for
 

7959
02:20:50,319 --> 02:20:51,750
harder prize for
compression of human knowledge and the

7960
02:20:51,750 --> 02:20:51,760
compression of human knowledge and the
 

7961
02:20:51,760 --> 02:20:54,070
compression of human knowledge and the
idea is really sort of

7962
02:20:54,070 --> 02:20:54,080
idea is really sort of
 

7963
02:20:54,080 --> 02:20:55,990
idea is really sort of
quantify like reduce the test of

7964
02:20:55,990 --> 02:20:56,000
quantify like reduce the test of
 

7965
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:57,670
quantify like reduce the test of
intelligence purely to just

7966
02:20:57,670 --> 02:20:57,680
intelligence purely to just
 

7967
02:20:57,680 --> 02:21:01,030
intelligence purely to just
ability to compress what's your

7968
02:21:01,030 --> 02:21:01,040
ability to compress what's your
 

7969
02:21:01,040 --> 02:21:03,910
ability to compress what's your
thoughts about this intelligence that's

7970
02:21:03,910 --> 02:21:03,920
thoughts about this intelligence that's
 

7971
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:04,550
thoughts about this intelligence that's
compression

7972
02:21:04,550 --> 02:21:04,560
compression
 

7973
02:21:04,560 --> 02:21:07,030
compression
i mean it's a it's a very uh fun test

7974
02:21:07,030 --> 02:21:07,040
i mean it's a it's a very uh fun test
 

7975
02:21:07,040 --> 02:21:09,190
i mean it's a it's a very uh fun test
because it's it's such a simple idea

7976
02:21:09,190 --> 02:21:09,200
because it's it's such a simple idea
 

7977
02:21:09,200 --> 02:21:12,469
because it's it's such a simple idea
like you're given wikipedia basically

7978
02:21:12,469 --> 02:21:12,479
like you're given wikipedia basically
 

7979
02:21:12,479 --> 02:21:13,750
like you're given wikipedia basically
english wikipedia

7980
02:21:13,750 --> 02:21:13,760
english wikipedia
 

7981
02:21:13,760 --> 02:21:16,309
english wikipedia
and you must compress it and so it stems

7982
02:21:16,309 --> 02:21:16,319
and you must compress it and so it stems
 

7983
02:21:16,319 --> 02:21:17,670
and you must compress it and so it stems
from

7984
02:21:17,670 --> 02:21:17,680
from
 

7985
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:21,110
from
the idea that cognition is compression

7986
02:21:21,110 --> 02:21:21,120
the idea that cognition is compression
 

7987
02:21:21,120 --> 02:21:22,550
the idea that cognition is compression
that the brain is basically a

7988
02:21:22,550 --> 02:21:22,560
that the brain is basically a
 

7989
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:24,630
that the brain is basically a
compression algorithm this is a very old

7990
02:21:24,630 --> 02:21:24,640
compression algorithm this is a very old
 

7991
02:21:24,640 --> 02:21:25,590
compression algorithm this is a very old
idea

7992
02:21:25,590 --> 02:21:25,600
idea
 

7993
02:21:25,600 --> 02:21:28,790
idea
it's a very i think striking

7994
02:21:28,790 --> 02:21:28,800
it's a very i think striking
 

7995
02:21:28,800 --> 02:21:32,230
it's a very i think striking
and beautiful idea i used to believe it

7996
02:21:32,230 --> 02:21:32,240
and beautiful idea i used to believe it
 

7997
02:21:32,240 --> 02:21:34,630
and beautiful idea i used to believe it
uh i eventually had to realize that it

7998
02:21:34,630 --> 02:21:34,640
uh i eventually had to realize that it
 

7999
02:21:34,640 --> 02:21:35,590
uh i eventually had to realize that it
was it was

8000
02:21:35,590 --> 02:21:35,600
was it was
 

8001
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:37,590
was it was
very much a flawed idea so i no longer

8002
02:21:37,590 --> 02:21:37,600
very much a flawed idea so i no longer
 

8003
02:21:37,600 --> 02:21:39,349
very much a flawed idea so i no longer
believe that compression

8004
02:21:39,349 --> 02:21:39,359
believe that compression
 

8005
02:21:39,359 --> 02:21:42,070
believe that compression
is recognition is compression so but i

8006
02:21:42,070 --> 02:21:42,080
is recognition is compression so but i
 

8007
02:21:42,080 --> 02:21:43,030
is recognition is compression so but i
can tell you

8008
02:21:43,030 --> 02:21:43,040
can tell you
 

8009
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:46,150
can tell you
what's the difference so it's very easy

8010
02:21:46,150 --> 02:21:46,160
what's the difference so it's very easy
 

8011
02:21:46,160 --> 02:21:47,030
what's the difference so it's very easy
to believe

8012
02:21:47,030 --> 02:21:47,040
to believe
 

8013
02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:49,030
to believe
that cognition and compression are the

8014
02:21:49,030 --> 02:21:49,040
that cognition and compression are the
 

8015
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:50,469
that cognition and compression are the
same thing because

8016
02:21:50,469 --> 02:21:50,479
same thing because
 

8017
02:21:50,479 --> 02:21:53,110
same thing because
uh so jeff hawkins for instance says

8018
02:21:53,110 --> 02:21:53,120
uh so jeff hawkins for instance says
 

8019
02:21:53,120 --> 02:21:53,990
uh so jeff hawkins for instance says
that cognition

8020
02:21:53,990 --> 02:21:54,000
that cognition
 

8021
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:55,670
that cognition
is prediction and of course prediction

8022
02:21:55,670 --> 02:21:55,680
is prediction and of course prediction
 

8023
02:21:55,680 --> 02:21:57,030
is prediction and of course prediction
is basically

8024
02:21:57,030 --> 02:21:57,040
is basically
 

8025
02:21:57,040 --> 02:21:58,870
is basically
the same thing as compression right it's

8026
02:21:58,870 --> 02:21:58,880
the same thing as compression right it's
 

8027
02:21:58,880 --> 02:22:00,790
the same thing as compression right it's
just

8028
02:22:00,790 --> 02:22:00,800
just
 

8029
02:22:00,800 --> 02:22:03,910
just
including the temporal axis and it's

8030
02:22:03,910 --> 02:22:03,920
including the temporal axis and it's
 

8031
02:22:03,920 --> 02:22:05,429
including the temporal axis and it's
very easy to believe this because

8032
02:22:05,429 --> 02:22:05,439
very easy to believe this because
 

8033
02:22:05,439 --> 02:22:07,190
very easy to believe this because
compression is something that we do

8034
02:22:07,190 --> 02:22:07,200
compression is something that we do
 

8035
02:22:07,200 --> 02:22:09,190
compression is something that we do
all the time very naturally we are

8036
02:22:09,190 --> 02:22:09,200
all the time very naturally we are
 

8037
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:10,710
all the time very naturally we are
constantly you know

8038
02:22:10,710 --> 02:22:10,720
constantly you know
 

8039
02:22:10,720 --> 02:22:13,990
constantly you know
compressing information we are um

8040
02:22:13,990 --> 02:22:14,000
compressing information we are um
 

8041
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,630
compressing information we are um
uh constantly trying we have this bias

8042
02:22:16,630 --> 02:22:16,640
uh constantly trying we have this bias
 

8043
02:22:16,640 --> 02:22:18,150
uh constantly trying we have this bias
towards simplicity we

8044
02:22:18,150 --> 02:22:18,160
towards simplicity we
 

8045
02:22:18,160 --> 02:22:20,070
towards simplicity we
we're constantly trying to organize

8046
02:22:20,070 --> 02:22:20,080
we're constantly trying to organize
 

8047
02:22:20,080 --> 02:22:21,670
we're constantly trying to organize
things in our mind and around

8048
02:22:21,670 --> 02:22:21,680
things in our mind and around
 

8049
02:22:21,680 --> 02:22:25,110
things in our mind and around
us to be more regular right so

8050
02:22:25,110 --> 02:22:25,120
us to be more regular right so
 

8051
02:22:25,120 --> 02:22:27,110
us to be more regular right so
uh it's it's a beautiful idea it's very

8052
02:22:27,110 --> 02:22:27,120
uh it's it's a beautiful idea it's very
 

8053
02:22:27,120 --> 02:22:28,230
uh it's it's a beautiful idea it's very
easy to believe

8054
02:22:28,230 --> 02:22:28,240
easy to believe
 

8055
02:22:28,240 --> 02:22:31,270
easy to believe
uh there is a big difference between uh

8056
02:22:31,270 --> 02:22:31,280
uh there is a big difference between uh
 

8057
02:22:31,280 --> 02:22:32,870
uh there is a big difference between uh
what we do with our brains

8058
02:22:32,870 --> 02:22:32,880
what we do with our brains
 

8059
02:22:32,880 --> 02:22:35,190
what we do with our brains
and and compression so compression is

8060
02:22:35,190 --> 02:22:35,200
and and compression so compression is
 

8061
02:22:35,200 --> 02:22:36,550
and and compression so compression is
actually kind of

8062
02:22:36,550 --> 02:22:36,560
actually kind of
 

8063
02:22:36,560 --> 02:22:39,990
actually kind of
a tool in the human cognitive toolkits

8064
02:22:39,990 --> 02:22:40,000
a tool in the human cognitive toolkits
 

8065
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:40,550
a tool in the human cognitive toolkits
that is

8066
02:22:40,550 --> 02:22:40,560
that is
 

8067
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:43,110
that is
is used in many ways but it's just a

8068
02:22:43,110 --> 02:22:43,120
is used in many ways but it's just a
 

8069
02:22:43,120 --> 02:22:44,469
is used in many ways but it's just a
tool it is not

8070
02:22:44,469 --> 02:22:44,479
tool it is not
 

8071
02:22:44,479 --> 02:22:46,309
tool it is not
it is a tool for cognition it is not

8072
02:22:46,309 --> 02:22:46,319
it is a tool for cognition it is not
 

8073
02:22:46,319 --> 02:22:47,590
it is a tool for cognition it is not
cognition itself

8074
02:22:47,590 --> 02:22:47,600
cognition itself
 

8075
02:22:47,600 --> 02:22:50,309
cognition itself
and the big fundamental difference is

8076
02:22:50,309 --> 02:22:50,319
and the big fundamental difference is
 

8077
02:22:50,319 --> 02:22:51,110
and the big fundamental difference is
that

8078
02:22:51,110 --> 02:22:51,120
that
 

8079
02:22:51,120 --> 02:22:54,309
that
cognition is about being able

8080
02:22:54,309 --> 02:22:54,319
cognition is about being able
 

8081
02:22:54,319 --> 02:22:57,510
cognition is about being able
to operate in future situations

8082
02:22:57,510 --> 02:22:57,520
to operate in future situations
 

8083
02:22:57,520 --> 02:23:00,790
to operate in future situations
that include fundamental uncertainty

8084
02:23:00,790 --> 02:23:00,800
that include fundamental uncertainty
 

8085
02:23:00,800 --> 02:23:04,389
that include fundamental uncertainty
and novelty so for instance consider a

8086
02:23:04,389 --> 02:23:04,399
and novelty so for instance consider a
 

8087
02:23:04,399 --> 02:23:05,510
and novelty so for instance consider a
child

8088
02:23:05,510 --> 02:23:05,520
child
 

8089
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:08,950
child
at age 10 and so they have 10 years

8090
02:23:08,950 --> 02:23:08,960
at age 10 and so they have 10 years
 

8091
02:23:08,960 --> 02:23:11,030
at age 10 and so they have 10 years
of life experience they've gotten you

8092
02:23:11,030 --> 02:23:11,040
of life experience they've gotten you
 

8093
02:23:11,040 --> 02:23:12,150
of life experience they've gotten you
know pain pleasure

8094
02:23:12,150 --> 02:23:12,160
know pain pleasure
 

8095
02:23:12,160 --> 02:23:14,870
know pain pleasure
rewards and and punishment in a period

8096
02:23:14,870 --> 02:23:14,880
rewards and and punishment in a period
 

8097
02:23:14,880 --> 02:23:16,550
rewards and and punishment in a period
of time

8098
02:23:16,550 --> 02:23:16,560
of time
 

8099
02:23:16,560 --> 02:23:20,389

02:23:23,270 --> 02:23:23,280
behavioral program that would have
 

8103
02:23:23,280 --> 02:23:24,230
behavioral program that would have
basically

8104
02:23:24,230 --> 02:23:24,240
basically
 

8105
02:23:24,240 --> 02:23:27,110
basically
run that child over this 10 years in an

8106
02:23:27,110 --> 02:23:27,120
run that child over this 10 years in an
 

8107
02:23:27,120 --> 02:23:28,550
run that child over this 10 years in an
optimal way

8108
02:23:28,550 --> 02:23:28,560
optimal way
 

8109
02:23:28,560 --> 02:23:31,750
optimal way
right the shortest optimal behavioral

that program
that that compress program this is what

02:23:38,309 --> 02:23:38,319
that that compress program this is what
 

8119
02:23:38,319 --> 02:23:39,830
that that compress program this is what
you would get if the mind of the child

8120
02:23:39,830 --> 02:23:39,840
you would get if the mind of the child
 

8121
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:41,990
you would get if the mind of the child
was a compression algorithm essentially

02:23:41,990 --> 02:23:42,000
was a compression algorithm essentially
 

8123
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:45,110
was a compression algorithm essentially
um would be utterly

but they are not perfectly compressed
 

8145
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:14,389
but they are not perfectly compressed
because they need to include

but that may turn out to be useful
 

8153
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:25,190
but that may turn out to be useful
in the future because you just don't

02:24:25,190 --> 02:24:25,200
in the future because you just don't

02:24:32,160 --> 02:24:34,389
that intelligence arises from is that
you need to be able to run appropriate

you need to be able to run appropriate
 

8165
02:24:34,399 --> 02:24:36,070
you need to be able to run appropriate
behavioral programs except you have

behavioral programs except you have
 

8167
02:24:36,080 --> 02:24:37,910

02:24:37,920 --> 02:24:39,750
absolutely no idea
what sort of context environment

8170
02:24:39,750 --> 02:24:39,760
what sort of context environment
 

8171
02:24:39,760 --> 02:24:41,030
what sort of context environment
situation

8172
02:24:41,030 --> 02:24:41,040
situation
 

8173
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:42,630
situation
are going to be running in and you have

8174
02:24:42,630 --> 02:24:42,640
are going to be running in and you have
 

8175
02:24:42,640 --> 02:24:44,230
are going to be running in and you have
to deal with that with that

8176
02:24:44,230 --> 02:24:44,240
to deal with that with that
 

8177
02:24:44,240 --> 02:24:46,550
to deal with that with that
uncertainty with that future normality

8178
02:24:46,550 --> 02:24:46,560
uncertainty with that future normality
 

8179
02:24:46,560 --> 02:24:47,510
uncertainty with that future normality
so an

8180
02:24:47,510 --> 02:24:47,520
so an
 

8181
02:24:47,520 --> 02:24:51,270
so an
analogy an analogy that you can make is

8182
02:24:51,270 --> 02:24:51,280
analogy an analogy that you can make is
 

8183
02:24:51,280 --> 02:24:54,389
analogy an analogy that you can make is
with investing for instance um

8184
02:24:54,389 --> 02:24:54,399
with investing for instance um
 

8185
02:24:54,399 --> 02:24:57,590
with investing for instance um
if i look at the past uh uh you know 20

8186
02:24:57,590 --> 02:24:57,600
if i look at the past uh uh you know 20
 

8187
02:24:57,600 --> 02:24:59,510
if i look at the past uh uh you know 20
years of stock market data

8188
02:24:59,510 --> 02:24:59,520
years of stock market data
 

8189
02:24:59,520 --> 02:25:01,910
years of stock market data
and i use a compression algorithm to

8190
02:25:01,910 --> 02:25:01,920
and i use a compression algorithm to
 

8191
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:03,349
and i use a compression algorithm to
figure out the best

8192
02:25:03,349 --> 02:25:03,359
figure out the best
 

8193
02:25:03,359 --> 02:25:04,870
figure out the best
trading strategy it's going to be you

8194
02:25:04,870 --> 02:25:04,880
trading strategy it's going to be you

02:25:04,880 --> 02:25:06,870
trading strategy it's going to be you
know you buy apple stock then maybe the

8196
02:25:06,870 --> 02:25:06,880
know you buy apple stock then maybe the
 

8197
02:25:06,880 --> 02:25:08,550
know you buy apple stock then maybe the
past few years you buy tesla stock or

8198
02:25:08,550 --> 02:25:08,560
past few years you buy tesla stock or
 

8199
02:25:08,560 --> 02:25:10,389
past few years you buy tesla stock or
something

8200
02:25:10,389 --> 02:25:10,399
something
 

8201
02:25:10,399 --> 02:25:13,270
something
but is that strategy still going to be

8202
02:25:13,270 --> 02:25:13,280
but is that strategy still going to be
 

8203
02:25:13,280 --> 02:25:14,630
but is that strategy still going to be
true for the next 20 years

8204
02:25:14,630 --> 02:25:14,640
true for the next 20 years
 

8205
02:25:14,640 --> 02:25:18,790
true for the next 20 years
well actually probably not which is why

8206
02:25:18,790 --> 02:25:18,800
well actually probably not which is why
 

8207
02:25:18,800 --> 02:25:21,750
well actually probably not which is why
if you're a smart investor you're not

8208
02:25:21,750 --> 02:25:21,760
if you're a smart investor you're not
 

8209
02:25:21,760 --> 02:25:23,030
if you're a smart investor you're not
you're not just going to be

8210
02:25:23,030 --> 02:25:23,040
you're not just going to be
 

8211
02:25:23,040 --> 02:25:26,230
you're not just going to be
following the strategy that

8212
02:25:26,230 --> 02:25:26,240
following the strategy that
 

8213
02:25:26,240 --> 02:25:28,630
following the strategy that
corresponds to compression of the past

8214
02:25:28,630 --> 02:25:28,640
corresponds to compression of the past
 

8215
02:25:28,640 --> 02:25:30,230
corresponds to compression of the past
uh you're going to be following

8216
02:25:30,230 --> 02:25:30,240
uh you're going to be following
 

8217
02:25:30,240 --> 02:25:32,710
uh you're going to be following
uh uh you're going to have a balanced

8218
02:25:32,710 --> 02:25:32,720
uh uh you're going to have a balanced
 

8219
02:25:32,720 --> 02:25:33,750
uh uh you're going to have a balanced
portfolio

8220
02:25:33,750 --> 02:25:33,760
portfolio
 

8221
02:25:33,760 --> 02:25:36,070
portfolio
yeah right because you just don't know

8222
02:25:36,070 --> 02:25:36,080
yeah right because you just don't know
 

8223
02:25:36,080 --> 02:25:38,070
yeah right because you just don't know
what's going to run

8224
02:25:38,070 --> 02:25:38,080
what's going to run
 

8225
02:25:38,080 --> 02:25:40,550
what's going to run
i mean i guess in that same sense the

8226
02:25:40,550 --> 02:25:40,560
i mean i guess in that same sense the
 

8227
02:25:40,560 --> 02:25:42,230
i mean i guess in that same sense the
compression is analogous to

8228
02:25:42,230 --> 02:25:42,240
compression is analogous to
 

8229
02:25:42,240 --> 02:25:43,510
compression is analogous to
what you talked about which is like

8230
02:25:43,510 --> 02:25:43,520
what you talked about which is like
 

8231
02:25:43,520 --> 02:25:45,830
what you talked about which is like
local or robust generalization

8232
02:25:45,830 --> 02:25:45,840
local or robust generalization
 

8233
02:25:45,840 --> 02:25:48,150
local or robust generalization
versus extreme generalization it's much

8234
02:25:48,150 --> 02:25:48,160
versus extreme generalization it's much
 

8235
02:25:48,160 --> 02:25:49,030
versus extreme generalization it's much
closer to that

8236
02:25:49,030 --> 02:25:49,040
closer to that
 

8237
02:25:49,040 --> 02:25:52,389
closer to that
side of being able to generalize in

8238
02:25:52,389 --> 02:25:52,399
side of being able to generalize in
 

8239
02:25:52,399 --> 02:25:54,309
side of being able to generalize in
in a local sense that's why you know as

8240
02:25:54,309 --> 02:25:54,319
in a local sense that's why you know as
 

8241
02:25:54,319 --> 02:25:56,469
in a local sense that's why you know as
humans as uh when we are when we are

8242
02:25:56,469 --> 02:25:56,479
humans as uh when we are when we are
 

8243
02:25:56,479 --> 02:25:57,429
humans as uh when we are when we are
children

8244
02:25:57,429 --> 02:25:57,439
children
 

8245
02:25:57,439 --> 02:26:00,550
children
um in our education so a lot of it is

8246
02:26:00,550 --> 02:26:00,560
um in our education so a lot of it is
 

8247
02:26:00,560 --> 02:26:01,590

driven by place

8248
02:26:01,590 --> 02:26:01,600
driven by place
 

8249
02:26:01,600 --> 02:26:05,510
driven by place
even by curiosity uh we we are not

8250
02:26:05,510 --> 02:26:05,520
even by curiosity uh we we are not
 

8251
02:26:05,520 --> 02:26:07,990
even by curiosity uh we we are not
efficiently compressing things we're

8252
02:26:07,990 --> 02:26:08,000
efficiently compressing things we're
 

8253
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:09,670
efficiently compressing things we're
actually exploring

8254
02:26:09,670 --> 02:26:09,680
actually exploring
 

8255
02:26:09,680 --> 02:26:15,190
actually exploring
we are um retaining all kinds of uh

8256
02:26:15,190 --> 02:26:15,200
we are um retaining all kinds of uh
 

8257
02:26:15,200 --> 02:26:18,070
we are um retaining all kinds of uh
uh things from our environment that that

8258
02:26:18,070 --> 02:26:18,080
uh things from our environment that that
 

8259
02:26:18,080 --> 02:26:19,830
uh things from our environment that that
seem to be completely useless because

8260
02:26:19,830 --> 02:26:19,840
seem to be completely useless because
 

8261
02:26:19,840 --> 02:26:21,030
seem to be completely useless because
they might

8262
02:26:21,030 --> 02:26:21,040
they might
 

8263
02:26:21,040 --> 02:26:24,309
they might
turn out to be eventually useful right

8264
02:26:24,309 --> 02:26:24,319
turn out to be eventually useful right
 

8265
02:26:24,319 --> 02:26:26,309
turn out to be eventually useful right
and it's it's that's what cognition is

8266
02:26:26,309 --> 02:26:26,319
and it's it's that's what cognition is
 

8267
02:26:26,319 --> 02:26:27,750
and it's it's that's what cognition is
really about and that what makes it

8268
02:26:27,750 --> 02:26:27,760
really about and that what makes it
 

8269
02:26:27,760 --> 02:26:30,070
really about and that what makes it
antagonistic to compression is that

8270
02:26:30,070 --> 02:26:30,080
antagonistic to compression is that
 

8271
02:26:30,080 --> 02:26:32,830
antagonistic to compression is that
it is about hedging for future

8272
02:26:32,830 --> 02:26:32,840
it is about hedging for future
 

8273
02:26:32,840 --> 02:26:34,469
it is about hedging for future
uncertainty and that's

8274
02:26:34,469 --> 02:26:34,479
uncertainty and that's
 

8275
02:26:34,479 --> 02:26:36,389
uncertainty and that's
efficient into compression yes

8276
02:26:36,389 --> 02:26:36,399
efficient into compression yes
 

8277
02:26:36,399 --> 02:26:38,230
efficient into compression yes
especially hedging so

8278
02:26:38,230 --> 02:26:38,240
especially hedging so
 

8279
02:26:38,240 --> 02:26:41,270
especially hedging so
uh cognition leverages compression as a

8280
02:26:41,270 --> 02:26:41,280
uh cognition leverages compression as a
 

8281
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:42,550
uh cognition leverages compression as a
tool to promote uh

8282
02:26:42,550 --> 02:26:42,560
tool to promote uh
 

8283
02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:45,670
tool to promote uh
uh to promote efficiency right and so

8284
02:26:45,670 --> 02:26:45,680
uh to promote efficiency right and so
 

8285
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:47,590
uh to promote efficiency right and so
in that sense in our models it's like

8286
02:26:47,590 --> 02:26:47,600
in that sense in our models it's like
 

8287
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:49,830
in that sense in our models it's like

yes so a good model of the world is

yes so a good model of the world is

yes because you need diversity in the

02:27:09,590 --> 02:27:09,600
yes because you need diversity in the
 

8311
02:27:09,600 --> 02:27:11,349
yes because you need diversity in the
same way that in your portfolio you need

8312
02:27:11,349 --> 02:27:11,359
same way that in your portfolio you need
 

8313
02:27:11,359 --> 02:27:12,630
same way that in your portfolio you need
all kinds of stocks that

8314
02:27:12,630 --> 02:27:12,640
all kinds of stocks that
 

8315
02:27:12,640 --> 02:27:14,389
all kinds of stocks that
that may not have performed well so far

8316
02:27:14,389 --> 02:27:14,399
that may not have performed well so far
 

8317
02:27:14,399 --> 02:27:15,910
that may not have performed well so far
but you need diversity and the reason

8318
02:27:15,910 --> 02:27:15,920
but you need diversity and the reason
 

8319
02:27:15,920 --> 02:27:17,429
but you need diversity and the reason
you need diversity because

8320
02:27:17,429 --> 02:27:17,439
you need diversity because
 

8321
02:27:17,439 --> 02:27:18,950
you need diversity because
fundamentally you don't know what you're

8322
02:27:18,950 --> 02:27:18,960
fundamentally you don't know what you're
 

8323
02:27:18,960 --> 02:27:21,190
fundamentally you don't know what you're
doing and the same is true of the human

8324
02:27:21,190 --> 02:27:21,200
doing and the same is true of the human
 

8325
02:27:21,200 --> 02:27:21,990
doing and the same is true of the human
mind

8326
02:27:21,990 --> 02:27:22,000
mind
 

8327
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,630
mind
is that it needs to to behave

8328
02:27:24,630 --> 02:27:24,640
is that it needs to to behave
 

8329
02:27:24,640 --> 02:27:25,990
is that it needs to to behave
appropriately

8330
02:27:25,990 --> 02:27:26,000
appropriately
 

8331
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:27,990
appropriately
in the future and it has no idea what

8332
02:27:27,990 --> 02:27:28,000
in the future and it has no idea what
 

8333
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:29,349
in the future and it has no idea what
the future is going to be like

8334
02:27:29,349 --> 02:27:29,359
the future is going to be like
 

8335
02:27:29,359 --> 02:27:30,870
the future is going to be like
it's a bit it's not going to be like the

8336
02:27:30,870 --> 02:27:30,880
it's a bit it's not going to be like the
 

8337
02:27:30,880 --> 02:27:32,950
it's a bit it's not going to be like the
past so compressing the past is not

8338
02:27:32,950 --> 02:27:32,960
past so compressing the past is not
 

8339
02:27:32,960 --> 02:27:34,710
past so compressing the past is not
appropriate because the past

8340
02:27:34,710 --> 02:27:34,720
appropriate because the past
 

8341
02:27:34,720 --> 02:27:38,309
appropriate because the past
is not uh it's not proactive in the

8342
02:27:38,309 --> 02:27:38,319
is not uh it's not proactive in the
 

8343
02:27:38,319 --> 02:27:40,469
is not uh it's not proactive in the

most inappropriately absurd question
we've talked a lot about intelligence

8354
02:27:54,469 --> 02:27:54,479
we've talked a lot about intelligence
 

8355
02:27:54,479 --> 02:27:57,510
we've talked a lot about intelligence
but you know the bigger question from

but you know the bigger question from
 

8357
02:27:57,520 --> 02:28:00,710

intelligence is of meaning you know
intelligence systems are kind of

8360
02:28:01,830 --> 02:28:01,840
intelligence systems are kind of
 

8361
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:02,870
intelligence systems are kind of
goal-oriented

8362
02:28:02,870 --> 02:28:02,880
goal-oriented
 

8363
02:28:02,880 --> 02:28:05,349
goal-oriented
there's throws optimizing for goal if

8364
02:28:05,349 --> 02:28:05,359
there's throws optimizing for goal if
 

8365
02:28:05,359 --> 02:28:06,469
there's throws optimizing for goal if
you look at the

8366
02:28:06,469 --> 02:28:06,479
you look at the
 

8367
02:28:06,479 --> 02:28:07,910
you look at the
harder prize actually i mean there's

8368
02:28:07,910 --> 02:28:07,920
harder prize actually i mean there's
 

8369
02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:09,110
harder prize actually i mean there's
always there's always a clean

8370
02:28:09,110 --> 02:28:09,120
always there's always a clean
 

8371
02:28:09,120 --> 02:28:10,870
always there's always a clean
formulation of a goal

8372
02:28:10,870 --> 02:28:10,880
formulation of a goal
 

8373
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:14,070
formulation of a goal
but the natural questions for us humans

8374
02:28:14,070 --> 02:28:14,080
but the natural questions for us humans
 

8375
02:28:14,080 --> 02:28:15,510
but the natural questions for us humans
since we don't know our objective

8376
02:28:15,510 --> 02:28:15,520
since we don't know our objective
 

8377
02:28:15,520 --> 02:28:17,349
since we don't know our objective
function is what is the meaning of it

8378
02:28:17,349 --> 02:28:17,359
function is what is the meaning of it
 

8379
02:28:17,359 --> 02:28:18,309
function is what is the meaning of it
all

8380

all
 

8381
02:28:18,319 --> 02:28:22,309
all
so the absurd question is what

8382
02:28:22,309 --> 02:28:22,319
so the absurd question is what
 

8383
02:28:22,319 --> 02:28:23,910
so the absurd question is what
francois chole do you think is the

basically sum up the meaning of life
 

8489
02:30:37,280 --> 02:30:40,150
basically sum up the meaning of life
like in the same way that we are the the

we are ourselves creating reports that

8500
02:30:48,870 --> 02:30:48,880
we are ourselves creating reports that
 

8501
02:30:48,880 --> 02:30:50,630
we are ourselves creating reports that
will propagate into the future

8502
02:30:50,630 --> 02:30:50,640
will propagate into the future
 

8503
02:30:50,640 --> 02:30:53,110
will propagate into the future
and that's why you know we should be

8504
02:30:53,110 --> 02:30:53,120
and that's why you know we should be
 

8505
02:30:53,120 --> 02:30:54,550
and that's why you know we should be
this seems like

8506
02:30:54,550 --> 02:30:54,560
this seems like
 

8507
02:30:54,560 --> 02:30:57,910
this seems like
