and there we was kind of this dichotomy

78
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:42,640
and there we was kind of this dichotomy
 

79
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,710
and there we was kind of this dichotomy
of it seemed really hard so that'd be

80
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:46,720
of it seemed really hard so that'd be
 

81
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,980
of it seemed really hard so that'd be
cool and interesting but you know at the

82
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:49,990
cool and interesting but you know at the
 

83
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,900
cool and interesting but you know at the
time we were the only robotics Institute

84
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:51,910
time we were the only robotics Institute
 

85
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,810

around and so if we went into it and

86
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:54,820
around and so if we went into it and
 

87
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,790
around and so if we went into it and
fell on our faces that would that would

88
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:56,800
fell on our faces that would that would
 

89
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,370

be embarrassing so I think you know just

90
00:01:59,370 --> 00:01:59,380
be embarrassing so I think you know just

00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,980
be embarrassing so I think you know just
having the will to go do it to try to do

this thing that at the time was marked
 

95
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,400
this thing that at the time was marked
as you know darn near impossible and and

96
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:05,410
as you know darn near impossible and and
 

97
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,560
as you know darn near impossible and and
then after a couple of tries be able to

98
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:07,570
then after a couple of tries be able to
 

99
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,770
then after a couple of tries be able to
actually make it happen I think that was

00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:09,780
actually make it happen I think that was
 

101
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,840
actually make it happen I think that was
you know that was really exciting but at

102
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:12,850
you know that was really exciting but at
 

103
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,310
you know that was really exciting but at
which point did you believe it was

00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:14,320
which point did you believe it was
 

105
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:14,940
which point did you believe it was
possible

106
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:14,950
possible
 

107
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,370

00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,140
did I believe it could be done yeah of
course right like why would you go do

124
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:32,150
course right like why would you go do
 

125
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,370
course right like why would you go do
something you thought was impossible

126
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:33,380
something you thought was impossible
 

127
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,590
something you thought was impossible
completely impossible we thought it was

128
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:35,600
completely impossible we thought it was
 

129
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,120
completely impossible we thought it was
gonna be hard we didn't know how we're

130
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,130
gonna be hard we didn't know how we're
 

131
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,170
gonna be hard we didn't know how we're
gonna be able to do it we didn't know if

132
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:38,180
gonna be able to do it we didn't know if
 

133
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,120
gonna be able to do it we didn't know if
we'd be able to do it the first time

134
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,130
we'd be able to do it the first time
 

135
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,140
we'd be able to do it the first time
turns out we couldn't

136
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:45,150
turns out we couldn't
 

137
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,869
turns out we couldn't
that yeah I guess you have to I think

138
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:48,879
that yeah I guess you have to I think
 

139
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,080
that yeah I guess you have to I think
there's a certain benefit to naivete

140

there's a certain benefit to naivete
 

141
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,420
there's a certain benefit to naivete
right that if you don't know how hard

142
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:54,430
right that if you don't know how hard
 

143
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,069
right that if you don't know how hard
something really is you you try

144

something really is you you try
 

145
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:58,740
something really is you you try
different things and you know gives you

different things and you know gives you
 

147
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,199
different things and you know gives you
an opportunity that others who are you

163
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,210
of this field is that it's all hard and
that's you have to be good at at each

164
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:24,220
that's you have to be good at at each
 

165
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,460
that's you have to be good at at each
part of it so for the first for the

166
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:26,470
part of it so for the first for the
 

167
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,250
part of it so for the first for the
urban challenges if I look back at it

168
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:29,260
urban challenges if I look back at it
 

169
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,399
urban challenges if I look back at it
from today

170
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:31,409
from today
 

171
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:37,020
from today
it should be easy today that you know it

172
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,030
it should be easy today that you know it
 

173
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,420
it should be easy today that you know it
was a static world there weren't other

174
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:39,430
was a static world there weren't other
 

175
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,069
was a static world there weren't other
actors moving through it that is what

176
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:41,079
actors moving through it that is what
 

177
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:43,440
actors moving through it that is what
that means it was out in the desert so

178
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:43,450
that means it was out in the desert so
 

179
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:47,490
that means it was out in the desert so
you get really good GPS you know so that

180
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:47,500
you get really good GPS you know so that
 

181
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,140
you get really good GPS you know so that
that went in you know we could map it

182
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:49,150
that went in you know we could map it
 

183
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,399
that went in you know we could map it
roughly and so in retrospect now it's

184
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:53,409
roughly and so in retrospect now it's
 

185
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:54,960
roughly and so in retrospect now it's
you know it's it's within the realm of

186
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:54,970
you know it's it's within the realm of
 

187
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,990
you know it's it's within the realm of
things we could do back then just

188
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,000
things we could do back then just
 

189
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,640
things we could do back then just
actually getting the vehicle and the you

190
00:03:59,640 --> 00:03:59,650
actually getting the vehicle and the you
 

191
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,629
actually getting the vehicle and the you
know there's a bunch of engineering work

192
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:00,639
know there's a bunch of engineering work
 

193
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,830
know there's a bunch of engineering work
to get the vehicle so that we could

194
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:01,840
to get the vehicle so that we could
 

195
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,770
to get the vehicle so that we could
control and drive it that's you know

196
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:04,780
control and drive it that's you know
 

197
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,899
control and drive it that's you know
that's still a pain today but it was

198
00:04:06,899 --> 00:04:06,909
that's still a pain today but it was
 

199
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:10,800
that's still a pain today but it was
even more so back then and then the

200
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:10,810
even more so back then and then the
 

201
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,750
even more so back then and then the
uncertainty of exactly what they wanted

202
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:12,760
uncertainty of exactly what they wanted
 

203
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,990
uncertainty of exactly what they wanted
us to do was was part of the challenge

204
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,000
us to do was was part of the challenge
 

205
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,879
us to do was was part of the challenge
as well right you didn't actually know

206
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:17,889
as well right you didn't actually know
 

207
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:19,710
as well right you didn't actually know
the track heading in you know

208
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:19,720
the track heading in you know
 

209
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,149
the track heading in you know
approximately but you know it didn't

210
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:21,159
approximately but you know it didn't
 

211
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:22,710
approximately but you know it didn't
actually know the route the route that's

212
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,720
actually know the route the route that's
 

213
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,240
actually know the route the route that's
gonna be taken that's right we didn't

214
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,250
gonna be taken that's right we didn't
 

215
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,640
gonna be taken that's right we didn't
know the route we didn't even really the

216
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:26,650
know the route we didn't even really the
 

217
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,830
know the route we didn't even really the
way the rules had been described you had

218
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:28,840
way the rules had been described you had
 

219
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,980
way the rules had been described you had
to kind of guess so if you think back to

220
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:31,990
to kind of guess so if you think back to
 

221
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,490
to kind of guess so if you think back to
that challenge the idea was to that the

222
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:35,500
that challenge the idea was to that the
 

223
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,320
that challenge the idea was to that the
the government would give us the DARPA

224
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:37,330
the government would give us the DARPA
 

225
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,930
the government would give us the DARPA
would give us a set of waypoints and

226
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:39,940
would give us a set of waypoints and
 

227
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,110
would give us a set of waypoints and
kind of the width that you had to stay

228
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,120
kind of the width that you had to stay
 

229
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,460
kind of the width that you had to stay
within between the line that went

230
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:44,470
within between the line that went
 

231
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,230
within between the line that went
between you know each of those waypoints

232
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,240
between you know each of those waypoints
 

233
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,719
between you know each of those waypoints
and so the the most devious thing they

234
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:48,729
and so the the most devious thing they
 

235
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:49,860
and so the the most devious thing they
could have done is set you know a

236
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:49,870
could have done is set you know a
 

237
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,830
could have done is set you know a
kilometer wide corridor across you know

238
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:52,840
kilometer wide corridor across you know
 

239
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,649
kilometer wide corridor across you know
a field of scrub brush and rocks and

240
00:04:55,649 --> 00:04:55,659
a field of scrub brush and rocks and
 

241
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:58,239
a field of scrub brush and rocks and
said you know go figure it out

242
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:58,249
said you know go figure it out
 

243
00:04:58,249 --> 00:05:00,129
said you know go figure it out
fortunately it really it turned into

244
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:00,139
fortunately it really it turned into
 

245
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:02,769
fortunately it really it turned into
basically driving along a set of trails

246
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:02,779
basically driving along a set of trails
 

247
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:05,199
basically driving along a set of trails
which you know is much more relevant to

248
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:05,209
which you know is much more relevant to
 

249
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:07,859
which you know is much more relevant to
to the application they were looking for

250
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:07,869
to the application they were looking for
 

251
00:05:07,869 --> 00:05:10,899
to the application they were looking for
but no it was it was a hell of a thing

252
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:10,909
but no it was it was a hell of a thing
 

253
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:14,499
but no it was it was a hell of a thing
back in the day so the legend read was

254
00:05:14,499 --> 00:05:14,509
back in the day so the legend read was
 

255
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:16,839
back in the day so the legend read was
kind of leading that effort in terms

256
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:16,849
kind of leading that effort in terms
 

257
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:21,100
kind of leading that effort in terms
just broadly speaking so you're a leader

258
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,110
just broadly speaking so you're a leader
 

259
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,259
just broadly speaking so you're a leader
now what have you learned from reading

260
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:23,269
now what have you learned from reading
 

261
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:25,689
now what have you learned from reading
about leadership I think there's a

262
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:25,699
about leadership I think there's a
 

263
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:29,679
about leadership I think there's a
couple things one is you know go and try

264
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:29,689
couple things one is you know go and try
 

265
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:31,179
couple things one is you know go and try
those really hard things that that's

266
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:31,189
those really hard things that that's
 

267
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:33,540
those really hard things that that's
where there is an incredible opportunity

268
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:33,550
where there is an incredible opportunity
 

269
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,029
where there is an incredible opportunity
I think the other big one though is to

270
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:37,039
I think the other big one though is to
 

271
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,999
I think the other big one though is to
see people for who they can be not who

272
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:40,009
see people for who they can be not who
 

273
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:42,879
see people for who they can be not who
they are it's one of the things that I

274
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:42,889
they are it's one of the things that I
 

275
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:44,709
they are it's one of the things that I
actually one of the deepest lessons I

276
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:44,719
actually one of the deepest lessons I
 

277
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:48,040
actually one of the deepest lessons I
learned from read was that he would look

278
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,050
learned from read was that he would look
 

279
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,519
learned from read was that he would look
at you know undergraduates or graduate

280
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:50,529
at you know undergraduates or graduate
 

281
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:55,779
at you know undergraduates or graduate
students and empower them to be leaders

282
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:55,789
students and empower them to be leaders
 

283
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:59,290
students and empower them to be leaders
to to you know have responsibility to do

284
00:05:59,290 --> 00:05:59,300
to to you know have responsibility to do
 

285
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,969
to to you know have responsibility to do
great things that I think another person

286
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:03,979
great things that I think another person
 

287
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:05,109
great things that I think another person
might look at them and think oh that's

288
00:06:05,109 --> 00:06:05,119
might look at them and think oh that's
 

289
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:06,369
might look at them and think oh that's
just you know another graduate student

290
00:06:06,369 --> 00:06:06,379
just you know another graduate student
 

291
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:09,359
just you know another graduate student
what could they know and so I think that

292
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:09,369
what could they know and so I think that
 

293
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,639
what could they know and so I think that
that you know kind of trust but verify I

294
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:12,649
that you know kind of trust but verify I
 

295
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:13,959
that you know kind of trust but verify I
have confidence and what people can

296
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:13,969
have confidence and what people can
 

297
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:15,669
have confidence and what people can
become I think is a really powerful

298
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:15,679
become I think is a really powerful
 

299
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:18,069
become I think is a really powerful
thing so through that it's just like

300
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:18,079
thing so through that it's just like
 

301
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,649
thing so through that it's just like
fast-forward through the history can you

302
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:20,659
fast-forward through the history can you
 

303
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:22,689
fast-forward through the history can you
maybe talk through the technical

304
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:22,699
maybe talk through the technical
 

305
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:25,839
maybe talk through the technical
evolution of autonomous vehicle systems

306
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:25,849
evolution of autonomous vehicle systems
 

307
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:28,419
evolution of autonomous vehicle systems
from the first to Grand Challenges to

308
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:28,429
from the first to Grand Challenges to
 

309
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:31,350
from the first to Grand Challenges to
the urban challenge to today are there

310
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:31,360
the urban challenge to today are there
 

311
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,119
the urban challenge to today are there
major shifts in your mind or is it the

312
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:34,129
major shifts in your mind or is it the
 

313
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:36,459
major shifts in your mind or is it the
same kind of technology just made more

314
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:36,469
same kind of technology just made more
 

315
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:39,069
same kind of technology just made more
robust I think there's been some big big

316
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:39,079
robust I think there's been some big big
 

317
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,390
robust I think there's been some big big
steps

318
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,400
steps
 

319
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,330
steps
so the for the grand challenge the real

320
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:45,340
so the for the grand challenge the real
 

321
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:50,290
so the for the grand challenge the real
technology that unlocked that was HD

322
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:50,300
technology that unlocked that was HD
 

323
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,540
technology that unlocked that was HD
mapping prior to that a lot of the

324
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:52,550
mapping prior to that a lot of the
 

325
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,890
mapping prior to that a lot of the
off-road robotics work had been done

326
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:55,900
off-road robotics work had been done
 

327
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,020
off-road robotics work had been done
without any real prior model of what the

328
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,030
without any real prior model of what the
 

329
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,780
without any real prior model of what the
vehicle was going to encounter and so

330
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:01,790
vehicle was going to encounter and so
 

331
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,150
vehicle was going to encounter and so
that innovation that the fact that we

332
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,160
that innovation that the fact that we
 

333
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,060
that innovation that the fact that we
could get you know decimeter resolution

334
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,070
could get you know decimeter resolution
 

335
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:13,930
could get you know decimeter resolution
models was really a big deal and that

336
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:13,940
models was really a big deal and that
 

337
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,560
models was really a big deal and that
allowed us to to kind of bound the

338
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:17,570
allowed us to to kind of bound the
 

339
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,120
allowed us to to kind of bound the
complexity of the driving problem the

340
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,130
complexity of the driving problem the
 

341
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,680
complexity of the driving problem the
vehicle had and allowed it to operate at

342
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:20,690
vehicle had and allowed it to operate at
 

343
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,180
vehicle had and allowed it to operate at
speed because we could assume things

344
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:22,190
speed because we could assume things
 

345
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,279
speed because we could assume things
about the environment that it was going

346
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:24,289
about the environment that it was going
 

347
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:27,550
about the environment that it was going
to encounter so that was a that was one

348
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:27,560
to encounter so that was a that was one
 

349
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,279
to encounter so that was a that was one
of the that was the big step there

350
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:31,289
of the that was the big step there
 

351
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:37,429
of the that was the big step there
for the urban challenge you know one of

352
00:07:37,429 --> 00:07:37,439
for the urban challenge you know one of
 

353
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:39,200
for the urban challenge you know one of
the big technological innovations there

354
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,210
the big technological innovations there
 

355
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,469
the big technological innovations there
was the multi beam lidar and being able

356
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
was the multi beam lidar and being able
 

357
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,709
was the multi beam lidar and being able
to generate a high resolution you know

358
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:45,719
to generate a high resolution you know
 

359
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:48,529
to generate a high resolution you know
mid to long range 3d models the world

360
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:48,539
mid to long range 3d models the world
 

361
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:52,820
mid to long range 3d models the world
and use that for you know for

362
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:52,830
and use that for you know for
 

363
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,809
and use that for you know for
understanding the world around the

364
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:53,819
understanding the world around the
 

365
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:55,219
understanding the world around the
vehicle and that was really a you know

366
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:55,229
vehicle and that was really a you know
 

367
00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:58,939
vehicle and that was really a you know
kind of a game-changing technology in

368
00:07:58,939 --> 00:07:58,949
kind of a game-changing technology in
 

369
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:02,929
kind of a game-changing technology in
parallel with that we saw a bunch of

370
00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:02,939
parallel with that we saw a bunch of
 

371
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:05,689
parallel with that we saw a bunch of
other technologies that have been kind

372
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:05,699
other technologies that have been kind
 

373
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:07,609
other technologies that have been kind
of converging half their their day in

374
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:07,619
of converging half their their day in
 

375
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:12,409
of converging half their their day in
the Sun so Bayesian estimation had been

376
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:12,419
the Sun so Bayesian estimation had been
 

377
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:17,139
the Sun so Bayesian estimation had been
you know slam had been a big field in

378
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:17,149
you know slam had been a big field in
 

379
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:19,369
you know slam had been a big field in
robotics you know you would go to a

380
00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:19,379
robotics you know you would go to a
 

381
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:20,809
robotics you know you would go to a
conference you know a couple years

382
00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:20,819
conference you know a couple years
 

383
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:23,209
conference you know a couple years
before that and every paper would

384
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:23,219
before that and every paper would
 

385
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:25,159
before that and every paper would
effectively have slams somewhere in it

386
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:25,169
effectively have slams somewhere in it
 

387
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:28,549
effectively have slams somewhere in it
and so seeing that you know that looks

388
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:28,559
and so seeing that you know that looks
 

389
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:31,549
and so seeing that you know that looks
Bayesian estimation techniques you know

390
00:08:31,549 --> 00:08:31,559
Bayesian estimation techniques you know
 

391
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:33,980
Bayesian estimation techniques you know
play out on a very visible stage you

392
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:33,990
play out on a very visible stage you
 

393
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,719
play out on a very visible stage you
know I thought that was that was pretty

394
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:35,729
know I thought that was that was pretty
 

395
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:38,250
know I thought that was that was pretty
exciting to see

396
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:38,260
exciting to see
 

397
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,560
exciting to see
and mostly slam was done based on lidar

398
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:40,570
and mostly slam was done based on lidar
 

399
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,870
and mostly slam was done based on lidar
that time well yeah and in fact we

400
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:42,880
that time well yeah and in fact we
 

401
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,360
that time well yeah and in fact we
weren't really doing slam per se you

402
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:45,370
weren't really doing slam per se you
 

403
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,100
weren't really doing slam per se you
know it you know in real time because we

404
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,110
know it you know in real time because we
 

405
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,570
know it you know in real time because we
had a model ahead of time we had a road

406
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:48,580
had a model ahead of time we had a road
 

407
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,660
had a model ahead of time we had a road
map but we were doing localization and

408
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:51,670
map but we were doing localization and
 

409
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,610
map but we were doing localization and
we were using you know the lidar or the

410
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:53,620
we were using you know the lidar or the
 

411
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,080
we were using you know the lidar or the
cameras depending on you know who

412
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,090
cameras depending on you know who
 

413
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,090
cameras depending on you know who
exactly was doing it to localize to a

414
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:57,100
exactly was doing it to localize to a
 

415
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,590
exactly was doing it to localize to a
model of the world and I thought that

416
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:58,600
model of the world and I thought that
 

417
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,980
model of the world and I thought that
was that was a big step from kind of

418
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:01,990
was that was a big step from kind of
 

419
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:06,360
was that was a big step from kind of
naively trusting GPS I and s before that

420
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:06,370
naively trusting GPS I and s before that
 

421
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,030
naively trusting GPS I and s before that
and and again like lots of work had been

422
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,040
and and again like lots of work had been
 

423
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,950
and and again like lots of work had been
going on in this field certainly this

424
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:10,960
going on in this field certainly this
 

425
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,920
going on in this field certainly this
was not doing anything particularly

426
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:13,930
was not doing anything particularly
 

427
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,400
was not doing anything particularly
innovative in slam over in localization

428
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:17,410
innovative in slam over in localization
 

429
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,680
innovative in slam over in localization
but it was seeing that technology

430
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:19,690
but it was seeing that technology
 

431
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,420
but it was seeing that technology
necessary in a real application on a big

432
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:21,430
necessary in a real application on a big
 

433
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,490
necessary in a real application on a big
stage I thought was very cool so for the

434
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:23,500
stage I thought was very cool so for the
 

435
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,130
stage I thought was very cool so for the
urban challenge that was already maps

436
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:25,140
urban challenge that was already maps
 

437
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,380
urban challenge that was already maps
constructed offline yes in general okay

438
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:28,390
constructed offline yes in general okay
 

439
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,720
constructed offline yes in general okay
and did people do that individually

440
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:30,730
and did people do that individually
 

441
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,780
and did people do that individually
individual teams do it individually so

442
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:33,790
individual teams do it individually so
 

443
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,190
individual teams do it individually so
they had their own difference of

444
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,200
they had their own difference of
 

445
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,560
they had their own difference of
different approaches there or they never

446
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:37,570
different approaches there or they never
 

447
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,190
different approaches there or they never
really kind of

448
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:40,200
really kind of
 

449
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,050
really kind of
share that information at least

450
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:42,060
share that information at least
 

451
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,500
share that information at least
intuitively so so the DARPA gave all the

452
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:45,510
intuitively so so the DARPA gave all the
 

453
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,170
intuitively so so the DARPA gave all the
teams a a model of the world they you

454
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:48,180
teams a a model of the world they you
 

455
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,220
teams a a model of the world they you
know a map and then you know one of the

456
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:52,230
know a map and then you know one of the
 

457
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,360
know a map and then you know one of the
things that we had to figure out back

458
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:53,370
things that we had to figure out back
 

459
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,880
things that we had to figure out back
then was and it's still one of these

460
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:55,890
then was and it's still one of these
 

461
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,320
then was and it's still one of these
things that trips people up today is

462
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:57,330
things that trips people up today is
 

463
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,220
things that trips people up today is
actually the coordinate system so you

464
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:01,230
actually the coordinate system so you
 

465
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,980
actually the coordinate system so you
get a latitude longitude and you know -

466
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:03,990
get a latitude longitude and you know -
 

467
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,450
get a latitude longitude and you know -
so many decimal places you don't really

468
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:05,460
so many decimal places you don't really
 

469
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,550
so many decimal places you don't really
care about kind of the ellipsoid of the

470
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:07,560
care about kind of the ellipsoid of the
 

471
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,920
care about kind of the ellipsoid of the
earth that's being used but when you

472
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:09,930
earth that's being used but when you
 

473
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,320
earth that's being used but when you
want to get to ten centimeter or

474
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:12,330
want to get to ten centimeter or
 

475
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,110
want to get to ten centimeter or
centimeter resolution you care whether

476
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,120
centimeter resolution you care whether
 

477
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,170
centimeter resolution you care whether
the the core system is you know Nats 83

478
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:18,180

00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,990
kind of the actually in I think I can't
remember which one the tectonic shifts

you know the the global datum as a

492
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:36,270
you know the the global datum as a
 

493
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:39,320
you know the the global datum as a
function of that so you're getting a map

494
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,330
function of that so you're getting a map
 

495
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,730
function of that so you're getting a map
and then actually matching it to reality

00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:44,310
of interesting and fun back then so how
 

501
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,160

much work was the perception doing there
 

503
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,680
much work was the perception doing there
so how how much were you relying on

00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:50,690
so how how much were you relying on
 

505
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,540
so how how much were you relying on

00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,760
a left turn
and we had to deal with the challenge of

552
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:43,770
and we had to deal with the challenge of
 

553
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,430
and we had to deal with the challenge of

you know the scale over which that you

00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,050
you know the scale over which that you
 

601
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,570
you know the scale over which that you
have to operate us now you know is much

602
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:49,580
have to operate us now you know is much
 

603
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,610
have to operate us now you know is much
larger than you know the airbase that we

so what easy question what do you think

608
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:56,720
so what easy question what do you think
 

609
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,890
so what easy question what do you think
is the hardest part about driving easy

610
00:12:59,890 --> 00:12:59,900
is the hardest part about driving easy

is the hardest part about driving easy
question yeah no I'm joking I I'm sure

difference is that were doing it for

difference is that were doing it for

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,260
difference is that were doing it for
real and that in that environment it was

00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:38,870
people separate from from robots at the
 

639
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:42,370
people separate from from robots at the
time and it only had to work for 60

640
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:42,380
time and it only had to work for 60
 

641
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,280
time and it only had to work for 60
miles which looking at it from you know

642
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:45,290
miles which looking at it from you know
 

643
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,800
miles which looking at it from you know
2006 it had to work for 60 miles yeah

644
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:47,810
2006 it had to work for 60 miles yeah
 

645
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:52,000
2006 it had to work for 60 miles yeah
right looking at it from now you know we

646
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,010
right looking at it from now you know we
 

647
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,530
right looking at it from now you know we
we want things that will go and drive

648
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:53,540
we want things that will go and drive
 

649
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,410
we want things that will go and drive
for you know half a half a million miles

650
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:56,420
for you know half a half a million miles
 

651
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,900
for you know half a half a million miles
and you know it's just a it's a

652
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:58,910
and you know it's just a it's a
 

653
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:03,730
and you know it's just a it's a
different game so how important he said

654
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:03,740
different game so how important he said
 

655
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,220
different game so how important he said
leiter came into the game early on and

656
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:06,230
leiter came into the game early on and
 

657
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,750
leiter came into the game early on and
it's really the primary driver of

658
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:07,760
it's really the primary driver of
 

659
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,360
it's really the primary driver of
autonomous vehicles today as a sensor so

660
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,370
autonomous vehicles today as a sensor so
 

661
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,980
autonomous vehicles today as a sensor so
how important is the role of lidar in

662
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:11,990
how important is the role of lidar in
 

663
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,920
how important is the role of lidar in
the sense of suite in the near term so I

664
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:14,930
the sense of suite in the near term so I
 

665
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,860
the sense of suite in the near term so I
think it's I think it's essential you

666
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:16,870
think it's I think it's essential you
 

667
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,450
think it's I think it's essential you
know I believe it but I also believe is

668
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:19,460
know I believe it but I also believe is
 

669
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,830
know I believe it but I also believe is
the cameras are essential and I believe

670
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:20,840
the cameras are essential and I believe
 

671
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,870
the cameras are essential and I believe
the radars is essential I think that you

672
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:22,880
the radars is essential I think that you
 

673
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,010
the radars is essential I think that you
you really need to use the composition

674
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:27,020
you really need to use the composition
 

675
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,300
you really need to use the composition
of data from from these different

676
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:28,310
of data from from these different
 

677
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,579
of data from from these different
sensors if you want the thing to to

678
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:30,589
sensors if you want the thing to to
 

679
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:33,730

00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:33,740
really be robust the question I want to
 

681
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,470
really be robust the question I want to
ask let's see if we kind of tangle is

682
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:35,480
ask let's see if we kind of tangle is
 

683
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,130
ask let's see if we kind of tangle is
what are your thoughts on the Elon Musk

684
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:39,140
what are your thoughts on the Elon Musk
 

685
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,900
what are your thoughts on the Elon Musk
provocative statement that lidar is a

686
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:40,910
provocative statement that lidar is a
 

687
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:45,490
provocative statement that lidar is a
crutch that is the kind of I guess

688
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:45,500
crutch that is the kind of I guess
 

689
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,090
crutch that is the kind of I guess
growing pains and that's much of the

690
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:49,100
growing pains and that's much of the
 

691
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,620
growing pains and that's much of the
perception tasks can be done with

692
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:50,630
perception tasks can be done with
 

693
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:55,050
perception tasks can be done with
cameras so I think it is undeniable that

694
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:55,060
cameras so I think it is undeniable that
 

695
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,670
cameras so I think it is undeniable that
people walk around without you know

696
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:57,680
people walk around without you know
 

697
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,319
people walk around without you know
lasers in their forehead

698
00:14:59,319 --> 00:14:59,329
lasers in their forehead
 

699
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:01,240
lasers in their forehead
and they can get into vehicles and drive

700
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,250
and they can get into vehicles and drive
 

701
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,990
and they can get into vehicles and drive
them and and so there's an existence

702
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:05,000
them and and so there's an existence
 

703
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,319
them and and so there's an existence
proof that you can drive using you know

704
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:08,329
proof that you can drive using you know
 

705
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:11,949
proof that you can drive using you know
passive fission no doubt can't argue

706
00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:11,959
passive fission no doubt can't argue
 

707
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:14,500
passive fission no doubt can't argue
with that in terms of sensors yeah so

708
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:14,510
with that in terms of sensors yeah so
 

709
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,540
with that in terms of sensors yeah so
yes maybe sensors right so like there's

710
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:16,550
yes maybe sensors right so like there's
 

711
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,509
yes maybe sensors right so like there's
there's an example that we all go do it

712
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:19,519
there's an example that we all go do it
 

713
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,300
there's an example that we all go do it
have many of us everyday in terms of

00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:24,310
have many of us everyday in terms of
 

715
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:29,050
have many of us everyday in terms of
latter being a crutch sure but but you

716
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:29,060
latter being a crutch sure but but you
 

717
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,319
latter being a crutch sure but but you
know in the same way that you know the

718
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:32,329
know in the same way that you know the
 

719
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:33,879
know in the same way that you know the
combustion engine was a crutch on the

720
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:33,889
combustion engine was a crutch on the
 

721
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:35,590
combustion engine was a crutch on the
path to an electric vehicle on the same

722
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:35,600
path to an electric vehicle on the same
 

723
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,689
path to an electric vehicle on the same
way that you know any technology

way that you know any technology
 

725
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:40,560
way that you know any technology
ultimately gets

726
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:40,570
ultimately gets
 

727
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,290
ultimately gets
replaced by some superior technology in

728
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:43,300
replaced by some superior technology in
 

729
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,740
replaced by some superior technology in
the future and really what with the way

730
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:46,750
the future and really what with the way
 

731
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,370
the future and really what with the way
that I look at this is that the way we

732
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:50,380
that I look at this is that the way we
 

733
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,960
that I look at this is that the way we
get around on the ground the way that we

734
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:51,970
get around on the ground the way that we
 

735
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:56,010
get around on the ground the way that we
use transportation is broken and that we

736
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:56,020
use transportation is broken and that we
 

737
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,530
use transportation is broken and that we
have you know this this you know what

738
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:58,540
have you know this this you know what
 

739
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,490
have you know this this you know what

00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:49,540
automotive companies and you know if
 

779
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,970
automotive companies and you know if
there's one word that comes up more

780
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:50,980
there's one word that comes up more
 

781
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,010
there's one word that comes up more
often than anything is costs and and

782
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:53,020
often than anything is costs and and
 

783
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,370
often than anything is costs and and
trying to drive cost down so while it's

trying to drive cost down so while it's
 

785
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,640
trying to drive cost down so while it's
it's true that it's a tragic number the

00:16:59,640 --> 00:16:59,650
it's true that it's a tragic number the
 

787
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:03,600
it's true that it's a tragic number the

37,000 the the question is what and I'm
 

789
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,010
37,000 the the question is what and I'm
not the one asking these questions I

790
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:05,020
not the one asking these questions I
 

791
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,470
not the one asking these questions I
hate this question but yeah we want to

hate this question but yeah we want to
 

793
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,670
hate this question but yeah we want to
find the cheapest sensor suite that the

794
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:11,680
find the cheapest sensor suite that the
 

795
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,080
find the cheapest sensor suite that the
creates a safe vehicle so in that

796
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:15,090
creates a safe vehicle so in that
 

797
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:19,020
creates a safe vehicle so in that
uncomfortable trade-off do you foresee

798
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,030
uncomfortable trade-off do you foresee
 

799
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:22,950
uncomfortable trade-off do you foresee
lidar coming down in cost in the future

800
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:22,960
lidar coming down in cost in the future
 

801
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,130
lidar coming down in cost in the future
or do you see a day where level for

802
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:26,140
or do you see a day where level for
 

803
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,550
or do you see a day where level for
autonomy is possible without lighter I

804
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:29,560
autonomy is possible without lighter I
 

805
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,890
autonomy is possible without lighter I
see both of those but it's really a

806
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:31,900
see both of those but it's really a
 

807
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,930
see both of those but it's really a
matter of time and I think really maybe

808
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:33,940
matter of time and I think really maybe
 

809
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,090
matter of time and I think really maybe
the I would talk to the question you

810
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:36,100
the I would talk to the question you
 

811
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,350
the I would talk to the question you
asked about you know the cheapest set

812
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:37,360
asked about you know the cheapest set
 

813
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,540
asked about you know the cheapest set
certainly I don't think that's actually

814
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:39,550
certainly I don't think that's actually
 

815
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,000
certainly I don't think that's actually
what you want what you want is a sensor

816
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,010
what you want what you want is a sensor
 

817
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:45,090
what you want what you want is a sensor
suite that is economically viable and

818
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:45,100
suite that is economically viable and
 

819
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,510
suite that is economically viable and
then after that everything is about

820
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:48,520
then after that everything is about
 

821
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,730
then after that everything is about
margin and driving cost out of the

822
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:50,740
margin and driving cost out of the
 

823
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,460
margin and driving cost out of the
system what you also want is a sense

824
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:53,470
system what you also want is a sense
 

825
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,280
system what you also want is a sense
suite that were

826
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:54,290
suite that were
 

827
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,510
suite that were
and so it's great to tell a story about

828
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:57,520
and so it's great to tell a story about
 

829
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,419
and so it's great to tell a story about
how you know how it'd be better to have

830
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:01,429
how you know how it'd be better to have
 

831
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:04,299
how you know how it'd be better to have
a self-driving system with a $50 sensor

832
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:04,309
a self-driving system with a $50 sensor
 

833
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:08,860
a self-driving system with a $50 sensor
instead of a you know a $500 dancer but

834
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:08,870
instead of a you know a $500 dancer but
 

835
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,690
instead of a you know a $500 dancer but
if the $500 sensor makes it work and the

836
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:10,700
if the $500 sensor makes it work and the
 

837
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,140
if the $500 sensor makes it work and the
$50 sensor doesn't work you know who

838
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:14,150
$50 sensor doesn't work you know who
 

839
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:18,549
$50 sensor doesn't work you know who
cares the longest you can actually you

840
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:18,559
cares the longest you can actually you
 

841
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,230
cares the longest you can actually you
have an economic offer you know there's

842
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:20,240
have an economic offer you know there's
 

843
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,880
have an economic offer you know there's
an economic opportunity there and the

844
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:21,890
an economic opportunity there and the
 

845
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,710
an economic opportunity there and the
economic opportunity is important

846
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:23,720
economic opportunity is important
 

847
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,470
economic opportunity is important
because that's how you actually have a

848
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:26,480
because that's how you actually have a
 

849
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,630
because that's how you actually have a
sustainable business and that's how you

850
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:28,640
sustainable business and that's how you
 

851
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,580
sustainable business and that's how you
can actually see this come to scale and

852
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:30,590
can actually see this come to scale and
 

853
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,190
can actually see this come to scale and
and and be out in the world and so when

854
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:33,200
and and be out in the world and so when
 

855
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,360
and and be out in the world and so when
I look at lidar I see a technology that

856
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:37,370
I look at lidar I see a technology that
 

857
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:40,720
I look at lidar I see a technology that
has no underlying fundamentally you know

858
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:40,730
has no underlying fundamentally you know
 

859
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,400
has no underlying fundamentally you know
expense to it fundamental expense to it

860
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:42,410
expense to it fundamental expense to it
 

861
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,230
expense to it fundamental expense to it
it's it's going to be more expensive

862
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:44,240
it's it's going to be more expensive
 

863
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,380
it's it's going to be more expensive
than an imager because you know CMOS

864
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:47,390
than an imager because you know CMOS
 

865
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:51,990
than an imager because you know CMOS
processes or you know fab processes are

866
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,000
processes or you know fab processes are
 

867
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,740
processes or you know fab processes are
dramatically more scalable than

868
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:53,750
dramatically more scalable than
 

869
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,190
dramatically more scalable than
mechanical processes but we still should

870
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:57,200
mechanical processes but we still should
 

871
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,900
mechanical processes but we still should
be able to drive cost out substantially

872
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:58,910
be able to drive cost out substantially
 

873
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:02,020
be able to drive cost out substantially
on that side and then I also do think

874
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,030
on that side and then I also do think
 

875
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:05,250
on that side and then I also do think
that with the right business model you

876
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:05,260
that with the right business model you
 

877
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,049
that with the right business model you
can absorb more you know certainly more

878
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:08,059
can absorb more you know certainly more
 

879
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:09,760
can absorb more you know certainly more
cost on the Bill of Materials yeah if

880
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:09,770
cost on the Bill of Materials yeah if
 

881
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:12,070
cost on the Bill of Materials yeah if
the sense of sweetie works extra values

882
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,080
the sense of sweetie works extra values
 

883
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,840
the sense of sweetie works extra values
provided thereby you don't need to drive

884
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:13,850
provided thereby you don't need to drive
 

885
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,060
provided thereby you don't need to drive
costs down to zero it's the basic

886
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:16,070
costs down to zero it's the basic
 

887
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,100
costs down to zero it's the basic
economics you've talked about your

888
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:18,110
economics you've talked about your
 

889
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,220
economics you've talked about your
intuition that level to autonomy is

890
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:20,230
intuition that level to autonomy is
 

891
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:23,590
intuition that level to autonomy is
problematic because of the human factor

892
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:23,600
problematic because of the human factor
 

893
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,250
problematic because of the human factor
of vigilance that command complacency

894
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:27,260
of vigilance that command complacency
 

895
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,049
of vigilance that command complacency
over trust and so on just us being human

896
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:29,059
over trust and so on just us being human
 

897
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:31,960
over trust and so on just us being human
yeah we trust the system we start doing

898
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:31,970
yeah we trust the system we start doing
 

899
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,810
yeah we trust the system we start doing
even more so partaking in the secondary

900
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:34,820
even more so partaking in the secondary
 

901
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,950
even more so partaking in the secondary
activities like smart phone and so on

902
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:37,960
activities like smart phone and so on
 

903
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,080
activities like smart phone and so on
have your views evolved on this point in

904
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,090
have your views evolved on this point in
 

905
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:44,020
have your views evolved on this point in
either direction can you can you speak

906
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,030
either direction can you can you speak
 

907
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:47,260
either direction can you can you speak
to it so and I want to be really careful

908
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:47,270
to it so and I want to be really careful
 

909
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,510
to it so and I want to be really careful
because sometimes this gets

910
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:49,520
because sometimes this gets
 

911
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,549
because sometimes this gets
twist in a way that's that that I

912
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:51,559
twist in a way that's that that I
 

913
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:55,480
twist in a way that's that that I
certainly didn't intend so active safety

914
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:55,490
certainly didn't intend so active safety
 

915
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,840
certainly didn't intend so active safety
systems are a really important

916
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:58,850
systems are a really important
 

917
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,070
systems are a really important
technology that we should be pursuing

918
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,080
technology that we should be pursuing
 

919
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,210
technology that we should be pursuing
and integrating into vehicles and

920
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:03,220
and integrating into vehicles and
 

921
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,500
and integrating into vehicles and
there's an opportunity in the near term

922
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:05,510
there's an opportunity in the near term
 

923
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,330
there's an opportunity in the near term
to reduce accidents reduce fatalities

924
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:07,340
to reduce accidents reduce fatalities
 

925
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,720
to reduce accidents reduce fatalities
and that's and we should be we should be

926
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:10,730
and that's and we should be we should be
 

927
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:14,799
and that's and we should be we should be
pushing on that level two systems are

928
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:14,809
pushing on that level two systems are
 

929
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:18,700
pushing on that level two systems are
systems where the vehicle is controlling

930
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:18,710
systems where the vehicle is controlling
 

931
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,639
systems where the vehicle is controlling
two axes so in breaking and braking and

932
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:21,649
two axes so in breaking and braking and
 

933
00:20:21,649 --> 00:20:25,570
two axes so in breaking and braking and
throttle / steering and I think there

934
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:25,580
throttle / steering and I think there
 

935
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,130
throttle / steering and I think there
are variants of level two systems that

936
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:27,140
are variants of level two systems that
 

937
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,019
are variants of level two systems that
are supporting the driver that

938
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:29,029
are supporting the driver that
 

939
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:30,700
are supporting the driver that
absolutely like we should we should

940
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:30,710
absolutely like we should we should
 

941
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:33,039
absolutely like we should we should
encourage to be out there where I think

942
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:33,049
encourage to be out there where I think
 

943
00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:37,060
encourage to be out there where I think
there's a real challenge is in the the

944
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,070
there's a real challenge is in the the
 

945
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,850
there's a real challenge is in the the
human factors part around this and the

946
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:39,860
human factors part around this and the
 

947
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:43,090
human factors part around this and the
misconception from the public around the

948
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:43,100
misconception from the public around the
 

949
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,370
misconception from the public around the
capability set that that enables and the

950
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:45,380
capability set that that enables and the

00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,610
capability set that that enables and the
trust they should have in it and that is

952
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:48,620
trust they should have in it and that is
 

953
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:52,120
trust they should have in it and that is
where I you know I kind of I am actually

incremental II more you know concerned
 

957
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:56,350
incremental II more you know concerned
around level three systems and you know

958
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:56,360
around level three systems and you know
 

959
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,149
around level three systems and you know
how exactly a level two system is

960
00:20:58,149 --> 00:20:58,159
how exactly a level two system is
 

961
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,880
how exactly a level two system is
marketed and delivered and you know how

962
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:00,890
marketed and delivered and you know how
 

963
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,320

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:02,330
people how much effort people have put
 

965
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:04,960
people how much effort people have put
into those human factors so I still

966
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:04,970
into those human factors so I still
 

967
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,299
into those human factors so I still
believe several things around this one

968
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:07,309
believe several things around this one
 

969
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:10,019
believe several things around this one
is people will over trust the technology

970
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:10,029
is people will over trust the technology
 

971
00:21:10,029 --> 00:21:12,639
is people will over trust the technology
we've seen over the last few weeks you

night of Trevor Noah
 

979
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,899
night of Trevor Noah
talking about this and you know him you

980
00:21:25,899 --> 00:21:25,909
talking about this and you know him you
 

981
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:28,299
talking about this and you know him you
know this is a smart guy who's has a lot

982
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:28,309
know this is a smart guy who's has a lot
 

983
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:31,029
know this is a smart guy who's has a lot
of resources at his disposal describing

984
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:31,039
of resources at his disposal describing
 

985
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,340
of resources at his disposal describing
a Tesla's a self-driving car and that

986
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:33,350
a Tesla's a self-driving car and that
 

987
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,659
a Tesla's a self-driving car and that
why shouldn't people be sleeping in

988
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:34,669
why shouldn't people be sleeping in
 

989
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:37,419
why shouldn't people be sleeping in
their Tesla there's like well because

990
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:37,429
their Tesla there's like well because
 

991
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,490
their Tesla there's like well because
it's not a self-driving car and it is

992
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:39,500
it's not a self-driving car and it is
 

993
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,909
it's not a self-driving car and it is
not intended to be and you know these

994
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:42,919
not intended to be and you know these
 

995
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:45,310
not intended to be and you know these
people will almost certainly you know

996
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:45,320
people will almost certainly you know
 

997
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,870
people will almost certainly you know
die at some point or hurt other people

998
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:49,880
die at some point or hurt other people
 

999
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,120
die at some point or hurt other people
and so we need to really be thoughtful

1000
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,130
and so we need to really be thoughtful
 

1001
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,769
and so we need to really be thoughtful
about how that technology is described

1002
00:21:53,769 --> 00:21:53,779
about how that technology is described
 

1003
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:57,039
about how that technology is described
and brought to market I also think that

1004
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:57,049
and brought to market I also think that
 

1005
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,830
and brought to market I also think that
because of the economic issue

1006
00:21:59,830 --> 00:21:59,840
because of the economic issue
 

1007
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,450
because of the economic issue
you know Iike my economic challenges we

00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,519
were just talking about
that that technology path will ugly

again the economics are very different

1030
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:27,539
again the economics are very different
 

1031
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:30,930
again the economics are very different
in those two worlds and so that leads to

1032
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:30,940
in those two worlds and so that leads to
 

1033
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,909
in those two worlds and so that leads to
you know divergent technology so you

1034
00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:32,919
you know divergent technology so you
 

1035
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:34,729
you know divergent technology so you
just don't see the economics of

00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:34,739
just don't see the economics of
 

1037
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:38,720
just don't see the economics of
gradually increasing from level two and

different basically different routes and

1048
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:50,830
different basically different routes and
 

1049
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:54,349
different basically different routes and
really that comes back to what are those

1050
00:22:54,349 --> 00:22:54,359
really that comes back to what are those
 

1051
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:57,659
really that comes back to what are those
l2 and l1 systems doing and and they are

1052
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:57,669
l2 and l1 systems doing and and they are
 

1053
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:01,529
l2 and l1 systems doing and and they are

00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:08,320
putting human factors in place such that
 

1061
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,009
putting human factors in place such that
the driver is actually responsible for

1062
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:11,019
the driver is actually responsible for
 

1063
00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:13,470
the driver is actually responsible for
the vehicle and that the technology is

1064
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:13,480
the vehicle and that the technology is
 

1065
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,409
the vehicle and that the technology is
there to support the driver and the

1066
00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:16,419
there to support the driver and the
 

1067
00:23:16,419 --> 00:23:19,739
there to support the driver and the
safety cases that are built around those

1068
00:23:19,739 --> 00:23:19,749
safety cases that are built around those
 

1069
00:23:19,749 --> 00:23:22,019
safety cases that are built around those
or dependence on that driver attention

1070
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:22,029
or dependence on that driver attention
 

1071
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:25,609
or dependence on that driver attention
and attentiveness and at that point you

1072
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:25,619
and attentiveness and at that point you
 

1073
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:29,100
and attentiveness and at that point you
you can kind of give up

1074
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:29,110
you can kind of give up
 

1075
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,320
you can kind of give up
to some degree for economic reasons you

1076
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:31,330
to some degree for economic reasons you
 

1077
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:33,960
to some degree for economic reasons you
can give up on safe false negatives and

1078
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:33,970
can give up on safe false negatives and
 

1079
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:36,270
can give up on safe false negatives and
so and the way to think about this is

1080
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:36,280
so and the way to think about this is
 

1081
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,340
so and the way to think about this is
for a for collision mitigation braking

1082
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:38,350
for a for collision mitigation braking
 

1083
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:42,900
for a for collision mitigation braking
system if it half the times the driver

1084
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:42,910
system if it half the times the driver
 

1085
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:45,660
system if it half the times the driver
missed a vehicle in front of it it hit

1086
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:45,670
missed a vehicle in front of it it hit
 

1087
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,740
missed a vehicle in front of it it hit
the brakes and brought the vehicle to a

1088
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:46,750
the brakes and brought the vehicle to a
 

1089
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,460
the brakes and brought the vehicle to a
stop that would be an incredible

1090
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:49,470
stop that would be an incredible
 

1091
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,350
stop that would be an incredible
incredible advance and in safety on our

1092
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:52,360
incredible advance and in safety on our
 

1093
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,730
incredible advance and in safety on our
roads right that would be equivalent to

1094
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:53,740
roads right that would be equivalent to
 

1095
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,130
roads right that would be equivalent to
seatbelts but it would mean that if that

1096
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:56,140
seatbelts but it would mean that if that
 

1097
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,750
seatbelts but it would mean that if that
vehicle wasn't being monitored it would

1098
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:57,760
vehicle wasn't being monitored it would
 

1099
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,130
vehicle wasn't being monitored it would
hit one out of two cars and so

1100
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:01,140
hit one out of two cars and so
 

1101
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,010
hit one out of two cars and so
economically that's a perfectly good

1102
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:04,020
economically that's a perfectly good
 

1103
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,210
economically that's a perfectly good
solution for a driver assistance system

1104
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:06,220
solution for a driver assistance system
 

1105
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,350
solution for a driver assistance system
what you should do at that point if you

1106
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,360
what you should do at that point if you
 

1107
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,610
what you should do at that point if you
can get it to work 50 percent of the

1108
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:08,620
can get it to work 50 percent of the
 

1109
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,620
can get it to work 50 percent of the
time is drive the cost out of that so

1110
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:10,630
time is drive the cost out of that so
 

1111
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,300
time is drive the cost out of that so
you can get it on as many vehicles as

1112
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:12,310
you can get it on as many vehicles as
 

1113
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,670
you can get it on as many vehicles as
possible but driving the cost out of it

1114
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:14,680
possible but driving the cost out of it
 

1115
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,250
possible but driving the cost out of it
doesn't drive up performance on the

1116
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:17,260
doesn't drive up performance on the
 

1117
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,740
doesn't drive up performance on the
false negative case and so you'll

1118
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:19,750
false negative case and so you'll
 

1119
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,450
false negative case and so you'll
continue to not have a technology that

1120
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:21,460
continue to not have a technology that
 

1121
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,640
continue to not have a technology that
could you know really be available for

1122
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:23,650
could you know really be available for
 

1123
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:27,750
could you know really be available for
for a self driven vehicle so clearly the

1124
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:27,760
for a self driven vehicle so clearly the
 

1125
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,220
for a self driven vehicle so clearly the
communication and this probably applies

1126
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:29,230
communication and this probably applies
 

1127
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:32,510
communication and this probably applies
though for vehicles as well the

1128
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:32,520
though for vehicles as well the
 

1129
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,890
though for vehicles as well the
marketing and a communication of what

1130
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:34,900
marketing and a communication of what
 

1131
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,360
marketing and a communication of what
the technology is actually capable of

1132
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:36,370
the technology is actually capable of
 

1133
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:38,640
the technology is actually capable of
how hard it is how easy it is all that

1134
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:38,650
how hard it is how easy it is all that
 

1135
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:41,220
how hard it is how easy it is all that
kind of stuff is highly problematic so

1136
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:41,230
kind of stuff is highly problematic so
 

1137
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,470
kind of stuff is highly problematic so
but it's say everybody in the world was

1138
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:43,480
but it's say everybody in the world was
 

1139
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,710
but it's say everybody in the world was
perfectly communicated and were made to

1140
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:46,720
perfectly communicated and were made to
 

1141
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,110
perfectly communicated and were made to
be completely aware of every single

1142
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,120
be completely aware of every single
 

1143
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,180
be completely aware of every single
technology out there what they what it's

1144
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:51,190
technology out there what they what it's
 

1145
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,360
technology out there what they what it's
able to do what's your intuition and now

1146
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:54,370
able to do what's your intuition and now
 

1147
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,250
able to do what's your intuition and now
maybe getting into philosophical ground

1148
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:56,260
maybe getting into philosophical ground
 

1149
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,460
maybe getting into philosophical ground
is it possible to have a level 2 vehicle

1150
00:24:59,460 --> 00:24:59,470
is it possible to have a level 2 vehicle
 

1151
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:04,950
is it possible to have a level 2 vehicle
where we don't over trust it I don't

1152
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:04,960
where we don't over trust it I don't
 

1153
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,410
where we don't over trust it I don't
think so if people truly understood the

1154
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:07,420
think so if people truly understood the
 

1155
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:13,170
think so if people truly understood the
risks and internalized it then then sure

1156
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:13,180
risks and internalized it then then sure
 

1157
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,730
risks and internalized it then then sure
you could do that safely but that that's

1158
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:14,740
you could do that safely but that that's
 

1159
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,620
you could do that safely but that that's
a world that doesn't exist that people

1160
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:16,630
a world that doesn't exist that people
 

1161
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,470
a world that doesn't exist that people
are going to they're gonna you know if

1162
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:19,480
are going to they're gonna you know if
 

1163
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,700
are going to they're gonna you know if
the facts are put in front of them

1164
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:20,710
the facts are put in front of them
 

1165
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,100
the facts are put in front of them
they're gonna then combine that with

1166
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:22,110
they're gonna then combine that with
 

1167
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:25,710
they're gonna then combine that with
their experience and you know let's say

1168
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:25,720
their experience and you know let's say
 

1169
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,380
their experience and you know let's say
they're they're using an l2 system and

1170
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:28,390
they're they're using an l2 system and
 

1171
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,390
they're they're using an l2 system and
they go up and down the 101 every day

1172
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:30,400
they go up and down the 101 every day
 

1173
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,450
they go up and down the 101 every day
and they do that for a month and it just

1174
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:33,460
and they do that for a month and it just
 

1175
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,570
and they do that for a month and it just
worked every day for a month like that's

1176
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:36,580
worked every day for a month like that's
 

1177
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,240
worked every day for a month like that's
pretty compelling at that point you know

1178
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:38,250
pretty compelling at that point you know
 

1179
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:41,340
pretty compelling at that point you know
just even if you know the statistics

1180
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:41,350
just even if you know the statistics
 

1181
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,049
just even if you know the statistics
like well

1182
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:43,059
like well
 

1183
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:43,950
like well
I don't know maybe there's something

1184
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:43,960
I don't know maybe there's something
 

1185
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,749
I don't know maybe there's something
funny about those maybe they're you know

1186
00:25:45,749 --> 00:25:45,759
funny about those maybe they're you know
 

1187
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:47,220
funny about those maybe they're you know
driving in difficult places like I've

1188
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:47,230
driving in difficult places like I've
 

1189
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,499
driving in difficult places like I've
seen it with my own eyes it works and

1190
00:25:49,499 --> 00:25:49,509
seen it with my own eyes it works and
 

1191
00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:51,810
seen it with my own eyes it works and
the problem is that that sample size

1192
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:51,820
the problem is that that sample size
 

1193
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,700
the problem is that that sample size
that they have so it's 30 miles up but

1194
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:53,710
that they have so it's 30 miles up but
 

1195
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:57,299
that they have so it's 30 miles up but
now so 60 miles times 30 days so 60 180

1196
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:57,309
now so 60 miles times 30 days so 60 180
 

1197
00:25:57,309 --> 00:26:01,830
now so 60 miles times 30 days so 60 180
a thousand eight hundred miles that's

1198
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:01,840
a thousand eight hundred miles that's
 

1199
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,720
a thousand eight hundred miles that's
that's a drop in the bucket compared to

1200
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:03,730
that's a drop in the bucket compared to
 

1201
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,820
that's a drop in the bucket compared to
the one you know what eighty-five

1202
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:05,830
the one you know what eighty-five
 

1203
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,799
the one you know what eighty-five
million miles between fatalities and so

1204
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:07,809
million miles between fatalities and so
 

1205
00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:10,499
million miles between fatalities and so
they don't really have a true estimate

1206
00:26:10,499 --> 00:26:10,509
they don't really have a true estimate
 

1207
00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:12,899
they don't really have a true estimate
based on their personal experience of

1208
00:26:12,899 --> 00:26:12,909
based on their personal experience of
 

1209
00:26:12,909 --> 00:26:15,029
based on their personal experience of
the real risks but they're gonna trust

1210
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:15,039
the real risks but they're gonna trust
 

1211
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,710
the real risks but they're gonna trust
it anyway because it's hard not to work

1212
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:16,720
it anyway because it's hard not to work
 

1213
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,310
it anyway because it's hard not to work
for a month

1214
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:17,320
for a month
 

1215
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,350
for a month
West what's gonna change so even if you

1216
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:19,360
West what's gonna change so even if you
 

1217
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,669
West what's gonna change so even if you
start at perfect understanding of the

1218
00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:20,679
start at perfect understanding of the
 

1219
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,580
start at perfect understanding of the
system your own experience will make it

1220
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:23,590
system your own experience will make it
 

1221
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,739
system your own experience will make it
drift and that's a big concern you know

1222
00:26:25,739 --> 00:26:25,749
drift and that's a big concern you know
 

1223
00:26:25,749 --> 00:26:28,259
drift and that's a big concern you know
over a year over two years even it

1224
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:28,269
over a year over two years even it
 

1225
00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:30,090
over a year over two years even it
doesn't have to be months and I think

1226
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:30,100
doesn't have to be months and I think
 

1227
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:35,580
doesn't have to be months and I think
that as this technology moves from what

1228
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:35,590
that as this technology moves from what
 

1229
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,810
that as this technology moves from what
I say it's kind of the more technology

1230
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:36,820
I say it's kind of the more technology
 

1231
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,779
I say it's kind of the more technology
savvy ownership group to you know the

1232
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:39,789
savvy ownership group to you know the
 

1233
00:26:39,789 --> 00:26:43,950
savvy ownership group to you know the
mass market you may be able to have some

1234
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:43,960
mass market you may be able to have some
 

1235
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,450
mass market you may be able to have some
of those folks who are really familiar

1236
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:45,460
of those folks who are really familiar
 

1237
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,950
of those folks who are really familiar
with technology they may be able to

1238
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:46,960
with technology they may be able to
 

1239
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,560
with technology they may be able to
internalize it better and you know

1240
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:49,570
internalize it better and you know
 

1241
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:51,869
internalize it better and you know
you're kind of immunization against this

1242
00:26:51,869 --> 00:26:51,879
you're kind of immunization against this
 

1243
00:26:51,879 --> 00:26:53,759
you're kind of immunization against this
kind of false risk assessment might last

1244
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:53,769
kind of false risk assessment might last
 

1245
00:26:53,769 --> 00:26:56,460
kind of false risk assessment might last
longer but as folks who are who aren't

1246
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:56,470
longer but as folks who are who aren't
 

1247
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:59,759
longer but as folks who are who aren't
as savvy about that you know read the

1248
00:26:59,759 --> 00:26:59,769
as savvy about that you know read the
 

1249
00:26:59,769 --> 00:27:01,109
as savvy about that you know read the
material and they compare that to their

1250
00:27:01,109 --> 00:27:01,119
material and they compare that to their
 

1251
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,879
material and they compare that to their
personal experience I think there that

1252
00:27:02,879 --> 00:27:02,889
personal experience I think there that
 

1253
00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:06,480
personal experience I think there that
you know it's it's going to it's gonna

1254
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:06,490
you know it's it's going to it's gonna
 

1255
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:09,600
you know it's it's going to it's gonna
move more quickly so your work the

1256
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:09,610
move more quickly so your work the
 

1257
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:11,369
move more quickly so your work the
program that you've created a Google and

1258
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:11,379
program that you've created a Google and
 

1259
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:15,330
program that you've created a Google and
now at Aurora is focused more on the

1260
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:15,340
now at Aurora is focused more on the
 

1261
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:18,600
now at Aurora is focused more on the
second path of creating full autonomy so

1262
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:18,610
second path of creating full autonomy so
 

1263
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:22,409
second path of creating full autonomy so
it's such a fascinating I think it's one

1264
00:27:22,409 --> 00:27:22,419
it's such a fascinating I think it's one
 

1265
00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:24,659
it's such a fascinating I think it's one
of the most interesting AI problems of

1266
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:24,669
of the most interesting AI problems of
 

1267
00:27:24,669 --> 00:27:27,299
of the most interesting AI problems of
the century right it's a I just talked

1268
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:27,309
the century right it's a I just talked
 

1269
00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:29,220
the century right it's a I just talked
to a lot of people just regular people I

1270
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:29,230
to a lot of people just regular people I
 

1271
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,019
to a lot of people just regular people I
don't know my mom about autonomous

1272
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:31,029
don't know my mom about autonomous
 

1273
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:33,779
don't know my mom about autonomous
vehicles and you begin to grapple with

1274
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:33,789
vehicles and you begin to grapple with
 

1275
00:27:33,789 --> 00:27:37,350
vehicles and you begin to grapple with
ideas of giving your life control over

1276
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:37,360
ideas of giving your life control over
 

1277
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,269
ideas of giving your life control over
to a machine is philosophically

1278
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:39,279
to a machine is philosophically
 

1279
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,220
to a machine is philosophically
interesting it's practically interesting

1280
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:41,230
interesting it's practically interesting
 

1281
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:44,070
interesting it's practically interesting
so let's talk about safety how do you

1282
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:44,080
so let's talk about safety how do you
 

1283
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,710
so let's talk about safety how do you
think we demonstrate you spoken about

1284
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:46,720
think we demonstrate you spoken about
 

1285
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,310
think we demonstrate you spoken about
metrics in the past how do you think we

1286
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:49,320
metrics in the past how do you think we
 

1287
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,560
metrics in the past how do you think we
demonstrate to the world that an

1288
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:52,570
demonstrate to the world that an
 

1289
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,200
demonstrate to the world that an
autonomous vehicle an Aurora system is

1290
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,210
autonomous vehicle an Aurora system is
 

1291
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,140
autonomous vehicle an Aurora system is
safe

1292
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:56,150
safe
 

1293
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,430
safe
this is one where it's difficult because

1294
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:57,440
this is one where it's difficult because
 

1295
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,120
this is one where it's difficult because
there isn't a soundbite answer that we

1296
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,130
there isn't a soundbite answer that we
 

1297
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:06,160
there isn't a soundbite answer that we
have to show a combination of work that

1298
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:06,170
have to show a combination of work that
 

1299
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:08,410
have to show a combination of work that
was done diligently and thoughtfully and

1300
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:08,420
was done diligently and thoughtfully and
 

1301
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,310
was done diligently and thoughtfully and
this is where something like a

1302
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:09,320
this is where something like a
 

1303
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,260
this is where something like a
functional safety process as part of

1304
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:11,270
functional safety process as part of
 

1305
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:13,390
functional safety process as part of
that is like here's here's the way we

1306
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:13,400
that is like here's here's the way we
 

1307
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,030
that is like here's here's the way we
did the work that means that we were

1308
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:16,040
did the work that means that we were
 

1309
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,880
did the work that means that we were
very thorough so you know if you believe

1310
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:18,890
very thorough so you know if you believe
 

1311
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,830
very thorough so you know if you believe
that we what we said about this is the

1312
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:20,840
that we what we said about this is the
 

1313
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,150
that we what we said about this is the
way we did it then you can have some

1314
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:22,160
way we did it then you can have some
 

1315
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,920
way we did it then you can have some
confidence that we were thorough in in

1316
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:23,930
confidence that we were thorough in in
 

1317
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,750
confidence that we were thorough in in
in the engineering work we put into the

1318
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:25,760
in the engineering work we put into the
 

1319
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,810
in the engineering work we put into the
system and then on top of that the you

1320
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:28,820
system and then on top of that the you
 

1321
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,360
system and then on top of that the you
know to kind of demonstrate that we

1322
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:31,370
know to kind of demonstrate that we
 

1323
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,560
know to kind of demonstrate that we
weren't just thorough we were actually

1324
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:32,570
weren't just thorough we were actually
 

1325
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:36,310
weren't just thorough we were actually
good at what we did there'll be a kind

1326
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:36,320
good at what we did there'll be a kind
 

1327
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,980
good at what we did there'll be a kind
of a collection of evidence in terms of

1328
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:38,990
of a collection of evidence in terms of
 

1329
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,690
of a collection of evidence in terms of
demonstrating that the capabilities work

1330
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:40,700
demonstrating that the capabilities work
 

1331
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,940
demonstrating that the capabilities work
the way we thought they did you know

1332
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:42,950
the way we thought they did you know
 

1333
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:45,220
the way we thought they did you know
statistically and and to whatever degree

1334
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:45,230
statistically and and to whatever degree
 

1335
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:48,730
statistically and and to whatever degree
we can we can demonstrate that both in

1336
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:48,740
we can we can demonstrate that both in
 

1337
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,500
we can we can demonstrate that both in
some combination of simulations some

1338
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:50,510
some combination of simulations some
 

1339
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:53,200
some combination of simulations some
combination of unit testing and

1340
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:53,210
combination of unit testing and
 

1341
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:55,390
combination of unit testing and
decomposition testing and then some part

1342
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:55,400
decomposition testing and then some part
 

1343
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,020
decomposition testing and then some part
of it will be on Road data and and I

1344
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,030
of it will be on Road data and and I
 

1345
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:02,040
of it will be on Road data and and I
think the the way we will ultimately

1346
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,050
think the the way we will ultimately
 

1347
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:04,540
think the the way we will ultimately
convey this to the public is they'll be

1348
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:04,550
convey this to the public is they'll be
 

1349
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:07,000
convey this to the public is they'll be
clearly some conversation with the

1350
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,010
clearly some conversation with the
 

1351
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:09,670
clearly some conversation with the
public about it but we'll you know kind

1352
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:09,680
public about it but we'll you know kind
 

1353
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,560
public about it but we'll you know kind
of invoke the the kind of the trusted

1354
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:11,570
of invoke the the kind of the trusted
 

1355
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:13,270
of invoke the the kind of the trusted
nodes and that will spend more time

1356
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:13,280
nodes and that will spend more time
 

1357
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,220
nodes and that will spend more time
being able to go into more depth with

1358
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:15,230
being able to go into more depth with
 

1359
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:18,550
being able to go into more depth with
folks like like nitsa and other federal

1360
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:18,560
folks like like nitsa and other federal
 

1361
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,230
folks like like nitsa and other federal
and state regulatory bodies and kind of

1362
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:20,240
and state regulatory bodies and kind of
 

1363
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,750
and state regulatory bodies and kind of
given that they are operating in the

1364
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:22,760
given that they are operating in the
 

1365
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,160
given that they are operating in the
public interest and they're trusted

1366
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,170
public interest and they're trusted
 

1367
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:28,260
public interest and they're trusted
that if we can you know show enough work

1368
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:28,270
that if we can you know show enough work
 

1369
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,780
that if we can you know show enough work
to them that they're convinced then you

1370
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:30,790
to them that they're convinced then you
 

1371
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,610
to them that they're convinced then you
know I think we're in a in a pretty good

1372
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:32,620
know I think we're in a in a pretty good
 

1373
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,090
know I think we're in a in a pretty good
place

1374
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:33,100
place
 

1375
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,190
place
that means you work with people that are

1376
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:35,200
that means you work with people that are
 

1377
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,350
that means you work with people that are
essentially experts at safety to try to

1378
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:37,360
essentially experts at safety to try to
 

1379
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,980
essentially experts at safety to try to
discuss and show do you think the answer

1380
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:40,990
discuss and show do you think the answer
 

1381
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:43,050
discuss and show do you think the answer
is probably no but just in case do you

1382
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:43,060
is probably no but just in case do you
 

1383
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,150
is probably no but just in case do you
think there exists a metric so currently

1384
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:45,160
think there exists a metric so currently
 

1385
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,650
think there exists a metric so currently
people have been using number of

1386
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:46,660
people have been using number of
 

1387
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,960
people have been using number of
disengagement yeah and it quickly turns

1388
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:48,970
disengagement yeah and it quickly turns
 

1389
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:50,850
disengagement yeah and it quickly turns
into a marketing scheme to just sort of

1390
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:50,860
into a marketing scheme to just sort of
 

1391
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,220
into a marketing scheme to just sort of
you alter the experiments you run to

1392
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:53,230
you alter the experiments you run to
 

1393
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,350
you alter the experiments you run to
adjust I think you've spoken that you

1394
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:55,360
adjust I think you've spoken that you
 

1395
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,810
adjust I think you've spoken that you
don't like no Mohammed no in fact I I

1396
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:57,820
don't like no Mohammed no in fact I I
 

1397
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,850
don't like no Mohammed no in fact I I
was on the record telling DMV that I

1398
00:29:59,850 --> 00:29:59,860
was on the record telling DMV that I
 

1399
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,070
was on the record telling DMV that I
thought this was not a great metric do

1400
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,080
thought this was not a great metric do
 

1401
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,990
thought this was not a great metric do
you think it's possible to create a

1402
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,000
you think it's possible to create a
 

1403
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,430
you think it's possible to create a
metric a number that that could

1404
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:08,440
metric a number that that could
 

1405
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,580
metric a number that that could
demonstrate safety outside of fatalities

1406
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:11,590
demonstrate safety outside of fatalities
 

1407
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:15,450
demonstrate safety outside of fatalities
so so I I do and I think that it won't

1408
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:15,460
so so I I do and I think that it won't
 

1409
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:19,250
so so I I do and I think that it won't
be just one number so as we are

1410
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:19,260
be just one number so as we are
 

1411
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,930
be just one number so as we are
internally grappling with us and at some

1412
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:21,940
internally grappling with us and at some
 

1413
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,340
internally grappling with us and at some
point we'll be we'll be able to talk

1414
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:23,350
point we'll be we'll be able to talk
 

1415
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,710
point we'll be we'll be able to talk
more publicly about it is how do we

1416
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:25,720
more publicly about it is how do we
 

1417
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,620
more publicly about it is how do we
think about human performance in

1418
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:28,630
think about human performance in
 

1419
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:31,620
think about human performance in
different tasks say detecting traffic

1420
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:31,630
different tasks say detecting traffic
 

1421
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:35,040
different tasks say detecting traffic
lights or safely making a left turn

1422
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,050
lights or safely making a left turn
 

1423
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:39,480
lights or safely making a left turn
across traffic and what do we think the

1424
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:39,490
across traffic and what do we think the
 

1425
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:40,740
across traffic and what do we think the
failure rates are for those different

1426
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:40,750
failure rates are for those different
 

1427
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,190
failure rates are for those different
capabilities for people and then

1428
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:43,200
capabilities for people and then
 

1429
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,970
capabilities for people and then
demonstrating to ourselves and then

1430
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:44,980
demonstrating to ourselves and then
 

1431
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:48,630
demonstrating to ourselves and then
ultimately folks the regulatory role and

1432
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:48,640
ultimately folks the regulatory role and
 

1433
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,180
ultimately folks the regulatory role and
and then ultimately the public that we

1434
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:51,190
and then ultimately the public that we
 

1435
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,590
and then ultimately the public that we
have confidence that our system will

1436
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:52,600
have confidence that our system will
 

1437
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,800
have confidence that our system will
work better than that and so these these

1438
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:55,810
work better than that and so these these
 

1439
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:58,580
work better than that and so these these
individual metrics will can tell a

1440
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:58,590
individual metrics will can tell a
 

1441
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:02,370
individual metrics will can tell a
compelling story ultimately I do think

1442
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:02,380
compelling story ultimately I do think
 

1443
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,920
compelling story ultimately I do think
at the end of the day what we care about

1444
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:04,930
at the end of the day what we care about
 

1445
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:09,990
at the end of the day what we care about
in terms of safety is life saved and

1446
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:10,000
in terms of safety is life saved and
 

1447
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,750
in terms of safety is life saved and
injuries reduced and then and then

1448
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:12,760
injuries reduced and then and then
 

1449
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,460
injuries reduced and then and then
ultimately you know kind of casualty

1450
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:14,470
ultimately you know kind of casualty
 

1451
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,410
ultimately you know kind of casualty
dollars

1452
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:16,420
dollars
 

1453
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,060
dollars
that people aren't having to pay to get

1454
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:18,070
that people aren't having to pay to get
 

1455
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,520
that people aren't having to pay to get
their car fixed and I do think that you

1456
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:20,530
their car fixed and I do think that you
 

1457
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:23,160
their car fixed and I do think that you
can you know we in aviation they look at

1458
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:23,170
can you know we in aviation they look at
 

1459
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:26,700
can you know we in aviation they look at
a kind of an event pyramid where you

1460
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:26,710
a kind of an event pyramid where you
 

1461
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,560
a kind of an event pyramid where you
know a crash is at the top of that and

1462
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:28,570
know a crash is at the top of that and
 

1463
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:30,540
know a crash is at the top of that and
that's the worst event obviously and

1464
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:30,550
that's the worst event obviously and
 

1465
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,610
that's the worst event obviously and
then there's injuries and you know

1466
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:32,620
then there's injuries and you know
 

1467
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,220
then there's injuries and you know
near-miss events and whatnot and and you

1468
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:35,230
near-miss events and whatnot and and you
 

1469
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,230
near-miss events and whatnot and and you
know violation of operating procedures

1470
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:37,240
know violation of operating procedures
 

1471
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,690
know violation of operating procedures
and and you kind of build a statistical

1472
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:39,700
and and you kind of build a statistical
 

1473
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:43,470
and and you kind of build a statistical
model of the relevance of the low

1474
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:43,480
model of the relevance of the low
 

1475
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,000
model of the relevance of the low
severity things to the high spirit of

1476
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,010
severity things to the high spirit of
 

1477
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,110
severity things to the high spirit of
things I think that's something where

1478
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:46,120
things I think that's something where
 

1479
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,560
things I think that's something where
we'll be able to look at as well because

1480
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:48,570
we'll be able to look at as well because
 

1481
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:51,690
we'll be able to look at as well because
you know an event per 85 million miles

1482
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:51,700
you know an event per 85 million miles
 

1483
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,270
you know an event per 85 million miles
that you know statistically a difficult

1484
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:54,280
that you know statistically a difficult
 

1485
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,940
that you know statistically a difficult
thing even at the scale of the u.s. to

1486
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:56,950
thing even at the scale of the u.s. to
 

1487
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,270
thing even at the scale of the u.s. to
to to kind of compare directly and that

1488
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:00,280
to to kind of compare directly and that
 

1489
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,370
to to kind of compare directly and that
event the fatality that's connected to

1490
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:02,380
event the fatality that's connected to
 

1491
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:07,290
event the fatality that's connected to
an autonomous vehicle is significantly

1492
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:07,300
an autonomous vehicle is significantly
 

1493
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,780
an autonomous vehicle is significantly
at least currently magnified in the

1494
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:09,790
at least currently magnified in the
 

1495
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:12,900
at least currently magnified in the
amount of attention and yet so that

1496
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:12,910
amount of attention and yet so that
 

1497
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:15,540
amount of attention and yet so that
speaks to public perception I think the

1498
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:15,550
speaks to public perception I think the
 

1499
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,370
speaks to public perception I think the
most popular topic about autonomous

1500
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:17,380
most popular topic about autonomous
 

1501
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:21,270
most popular topic about autonomous
vehicles in the public is the trolley

1502
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:21,280
vehicles in the public is the trolley
 

1503
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,980
vehicles in the public is the trolley
problem formulation right which has

to the fact that people are grappling

00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:35,160
to the fact that people are grappling
with this idea of giving control over to

a machine so how do you win the hearts
 

1515
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:43,110
a machine so how do you win the hearts
and minds of the people that autonomy is

and minds of the people that autonomy is

something that could be a part of their

alright I think it's I think I think

00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:49,930
alright I think it's I think I think
 

1523
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,300
alright I think it's I think I think
it's right I think people should be

00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:51,310
it's right I think people should be
 

1525
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:54,900
it's right I think people should be
skeptical I think people should ask

1526
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:54,910
skeptical I think people should ask
 

1527
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:57,380
skeptical I think people should ask
questions I think they should doubt

1528
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:57,390
questions I think they should doubt
 

1529
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:59,400
questions I think they should doubt
because this is something new and

1530
00:32:59,400 --> 00:32:59,410
because this is something new and

00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,080
because this is something new and
different

different
they haven't touched it yet and I think

1534
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:02,200
they haven't touched it yet and I think
 

1535
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,670
they haven't touched it yet and I think
it's perfectly reasonable and but at the

1536
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:05,680
it's perfectly reasonable and but at the
 

1537
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,190
it's perfectly reasonable and but at the
same time it's clear there's an

1538
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:08,200
same time it's clear there's an
 

1539
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,480
same time it's clear there's an
opportunity to make the roads safer it's

1540
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:09,490
opportunity to make the roads safer it's
 

1541
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,940
opportunity to make the roads safer it's
clear that we can improve access to

1542
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:11,950
clear that we can improve access to
 

1543
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,470
clear that we can improve access to
mobility it's clear that we can reduce

1544
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:13,480
mobility it's clear that we can reduce
 

1545
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,160
mobility it's clear that we can reduce
the cost of mobility and that once

1546
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,170
the cost of mobility and that once
 

1547
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:21,510
the cost of mobility and that once
people try that and are you know

1548
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:21,520
people try that and are you know
 

1549
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,430
people try that and are you know
understand that it's safe and are able

1550
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:23,440
understand that it's safe and are able
 

1551
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,810
understand that it's safe and are able
to use in their daily lives I think it's

1552
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:24,820
to use in their daily lives I think it's
 

1553
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,450
to use in their daily lives I think it's
one of these things that will will just

00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:27,460
one of these things that will will just
 

1555
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,770
one of these things that will will just
be obvious and I've seen this

1556
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:28,780
be obvious and I've seen this
 

1557
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,430
be obvious and I've seen this
practically

1558
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:30,440
practically
 

1559
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,040

1563
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:38,680
know given where I've had people come in

00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:45,410
65 miles an hour
 

1573
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:47,950
65 miles an hour
and after ten minutes they they kind of

1574
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:47,960
and after ten minutes they they kind of
 

1575
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,600
and after ten minutes they they kind of
turn and ask is that all it does and

1576
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:49,610
turn and ask is that all it does and
 

1577
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,090
turn and ask is that all it does and
you're like yeah it's self-driving car

1578
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:52,100
you're like yeah it's self-driving car
 

1579
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,410
you're like yeah it's self-driving car
not sure exactly which I thought it

1580
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:53,420
not sure exactly which I thought it
 

1581
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:56,590
not sure exactly which I thought it
would be right but they you know they it

1582
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:56,600
would be right but they you know they it
 

1583
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,620
would be right but they you know they it
becomes mundane which is which is

1584
00:33:59,620 --> 00:33:59,630
becomes mundane which is which is
 

1585
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,630
becomes mundane which is which is
exactly what you want a technology like

1586
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:01,640
exactly what you want a technology like
 

1587
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,810
exactly what you want a technology like
this to be right we don't really when I

1588
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:04,820
this to be right we don't really when I
 

1589
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,480
this to be right we don't really when I
turn the light switch on in here I don't

1590
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:07,490
turn the light switch on in here I don't
 

1591
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,970
turn the light switch on in here I don't
think about the complexity of you know

1592
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:09,980
think about the complexity of you know
 

1593
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,220
think about the complexity of you know
the those electrons you know being

1594
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:12,230
the those electrons you know being
 

1595
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,930
the those electrons you know being
pushed down a wire from wherever it was

1596
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:13,940
pushed down a wire from wherever it was
 

1597
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:16,000
pushed down a wire from wherever it was
and being generated it's not like it's

1598
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,010
and being generated it's not like it's
 

1599
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,830
and being generated it's not like it's
just it's like I just get annoyed if it

1600
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:17,840
just it's like I just get annoyed if it
 

1601
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,980
just it's like I just get annoyed if it
doesn't work right and and what I value

1602
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:20,990
doesn't work right and and what I value
 

1603
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:22,419
doesn't work right and and what I value
is the fact that I can do other things

1604
00:34:22,419 --> 00:34:22,429
is the fact that I can do other things
 

1605
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:24,100
is the fact that I can do other things
in this space I can you know see my

1606
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:24,110
in this space I can you know see my
 

1607
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,139
in this space I can you know see my
colleagues I can read stuff on a paper I

1608
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:26,149
colleagues I can read stuff on a paper I
 

1609
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:29,980
colleagues I can read stuff on a paper I
can you know not be afraid of the dark

1610
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:29,990
can you know not be afraid of the dark
 

1611
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:32,200
can you know not be afraid of the dark
and I think that's what we want this

1612
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:32,210
and I think that's what we want this
 

1613
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:34,030
and I think that's what we want this
technology to be like is it's it's in

1614
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:34,040
technology to be like is it's it's in
 

1615
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,379
technology to be like is it's it's in
the background and people get to have

1616
00:34:35,379 --> 00:34:35,389
the background and people get to have
 

1617
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:37,659
the background and people get to have
those those life experiences and and do

1618
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:37,669
those those life experiences and and do
 

1619
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:38,260
those those life experiences and and do
so safely

1620
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:38,270
so safely
 

1621
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:41,619
so safely
so putting this technology in the hands

1622
00:34:41,619 --> 00:34:41,629
so putting this technology in the hands
 

1623
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:45,490
so putting this technology in the hands
of people speaks to scale the deployment

1624
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:45,500
of people speaks to scale the deployment
 

1625
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,570
of people speaks to scale the deployment
all right so what do you think the the

1626
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:49,580
all right so what do you think the the
 

1627
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,680
all right so what do you think the the
dreaded question about the future

1628
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:50,690
dreaded question about the future
 

1629
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:52,119
dreaded question about the future
because nobody can predict the future

1630
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:52,129
because nobody can predict the future
 

1631
00:34:52,129 --> 00:34:57,129
because nobody can predict the future
yeah but just maybe speak poetically

1632
00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:57,139
yeah but just maybe speak poetically
 

1633
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:59,260
yeah but just maybe speak poetically
about when do you think we'll see a

1634
00:34:59,260 --> 00:34:59,270
about when do you think we'll see a
 

1635
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:02,590
about when do you think we'll see a
large-scale deployment of autonomous

1636
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:02,600
large-scale deployment of autonomous
 

1637
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,680
large-scale deployment of autonomous
vehicles ten thousand those kinds of

1638
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:05,690
vehicles ten thousand those kinds of
 

1639
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,750
vehicles ten thousand those kinds of
numbers you will see that within ten

1640
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:07,760
numbers you will see that within ten
 

1641
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:14,440
numbers you will see that within ten
years I'm pretty confident we what's an

1642
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:14,450
years I'm pretty confident we what's an
 

1643
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:18,280
years I'm pretty confident we what's an
impressive scale what moment so you've

1644
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:18,290
impressive scale what moment so you've
 

1645
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,660
impressive scale what moment so you've
done DARPA Challenger there's one

1646
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:19,670
done DARPA Challenger there's one
 

1647
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,820
done DARPA Challenger there's one
vehicle at which moment does it become

1648
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:21,830
vehicle at which moment does it become
 

1649
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:25,120
vehicle at which moment does it become
wow this is serious scale so so I think

1650
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,130
wow this is serious scale so so I think
 

1651
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:28,390
wow this is serious scale so so I think
the moment it gets serious is when we

1652
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:28,400
the moment it gets serious is when we
 

1653
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,230
the moment it gets serious is when we
really do have driverless vehicle

1654
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:32,240
really do have driverless vehicle
 

1655
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,680
really do have driverless vehicle
operating on public roads and that we

1656
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:35,690
operating on public roads and that we
 

1657
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:38,110
operating on public roads and that we
can do that kind of continuously without

1658
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:38,120
can do that kind of continuously without
 

1659
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,910
can do that kind of continuously without
a safety dry without a safety driver in

1660
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:39,920
a safety dry without a safety driver in
 

1661
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,680
a safety dry without a safety driver in
the vehicle I think at that moment we've

1662
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:41,690
the vehicle I think at that moment we've
 

1663
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:43,570
the vehicle I think at that moment we've
we've kind of crossed the zero to one

1664
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:43,580
we've kind of crossed the zero to one
 

1665
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:43,920
we've kind of crossed the zero to one
throw

1666
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:43,930
throw
 

1667
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:48,750
throw
shoulde and then it is about how do we

1668
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:48,760
shoulde and then it is about how do we
 

1669
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,740
shoulde and then it is about how do we
continue to scale that how do we build

1670
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:52,750
continue to scale that how do we build
 

1671
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,270
continue to scale that how do we build
the right business models how do we

1672
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:54,280
the right business models how do we
 

1673
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,740
the right business models how do we
build the right customer experience

1674
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:55,750
build the right customer experience
 

1675
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,870
build the right customer experience
around it so that it is actually you

1676
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:57,880
around it so that it is actually you
 

1677
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,609
around it so that it is actually you
know a useful product out in the world

1678
00:35:59,609 --> 00:35:59,619
know a useful product out in the world
 

1679
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:04,380
know a useful product out in the world
and I think that is really at that point

1680
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:04,390
and I think that is really at that point
 

1681
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,390
and I think that is really at that point
it moves from a you know what is this

1682
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:06,400
it moves from a you know what is this
 

1683
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,980
it moves from a you know what is this
kind of mixed science engineering

1684
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:07,990
kind of mixed science engineering

00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:14,200
commercialization and really starting to
 

1689
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,829
commercialization and really starting to
deliver on the value that we all see

1690
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:16,839
deliver on the value that we all see
 

1691
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:19,500
deliver on the value that we all see
here and you know actually making that

1692
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:19,510
here and you know actually making that
 

1693
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,240
here and you know actually making that
real in the world what do you think that

1694
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:21,250
real in the world what do you think that
 

1695
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,130
real in the world what do you think that
deployment looks like where do we first

1696
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:23,140
deployment looks like where do we first
 

1697
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:26,579
deployment looks like where do we first
see the inkling of no safety driver one

1698
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:26,589
see the inkling of no safety driver one
 

1699
00:36:26,589 --> 00:36:29,099
see the inkling of no safety driver one
or two cars here and there is it on the

1700
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:29,109
or two cars here and there is it on the
 

1701
00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:31,380
or two cars here and there is it on the
highway is it in specific roads in the

1702
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:31,390
highway is it in specific roads in the
 

1703
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,079
highway is it in specific roads in the
urban environment I think it's going to

1704
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:34,089
urban environment I think it's going to
 

1705
00:36:34,089 --> 00:36:38,010
urban environment I think it's going to
be urban suburban type environments you

1706
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:38,020
be urban suburban type environments you
 

1707
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,990
be urban suburban type environments you
know with a roar when we we thought

1708
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:40,000
know with a roar when we we thought
 

1709
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,079
know with a roar when we we thought
about how to tackle this I is kind of

1710
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:43,089
about how to tackle this I is kind of
 

1711
00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:45,530
about how to tackle this I is kind of
enfoque to think about trucking as

1712
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:45,540
enfoque to think about trucking as
 

1713
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,930
enfoque to think about trucking as
opposed to urban driving and and you

1714
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:48,940
opposed to urban driving and and you
 

1715
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,220
opposed to urban driving and and you
know the again the human intuition

1716
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:50,230
know the again the human intuition
 

1717
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:54,059
know the again the human intuition
around this is that freeways are easier

1718
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:54,069
around this is that freeways are easier
 

1719
00:36:54,069 --> 00:36:58,020
around this is that freeways are easier
to drive on because everybody's kind of

1720
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,030
to drive on because everybody's kind of
 

1721
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,700
to drive on because everybody's kind of
going in the same direction and you know

1722
00:36:59,700 --> 00:36:59,710
going in the same direction and you know
 

1723
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:02,069
going in the same direction and you know
lanes are wider etc and I think that

1724
00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:02,079
lanes are wider etc and I think that
 

1725
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,960
lanes are wider etc and I think that
that intuition is pretty good except we

1726
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:03,970
that intuition is pretty good except we
 

1727
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:05,730
that intuition is pretty good except we
don't really care about most of the time

1728
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:05,740
don't really care about most of the time
 

1729
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,700
don't really care about most of the time
we we care about all of the time and

1730
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:08,710
we we care about all of the time and
 

1731
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,380
we we care about all of the time and
when you're driving on a freeway with a

1732
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:10,390
when you're driving on a freeway with a
 

1733
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:14,730
when you're driving on a freeway with a
truck say 70 70 miles an hour and you've

1734
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:14,740
truck say 70 70 miles an hour and you've
 

1735
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,289
truck say 70 70 miles an hour and you've
got 70,000 pound load with you that's

1736
00:37:16,289 --> 00:37:16,299
got 70,000 pound load with you that's
 

1737
00:37:16,299 --> 00:37:17,640
got 70,000 pound load with you that's
just an incredible amount of kinetic

1738
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:17,650
just an incredible amount of kinetic
 

1739
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:20,309
just an incredible amount of kinetic
energy and so when that goes wrong it

1740
00:37:20,309 --> 00:37:20,319
energy and so when that goes wrong it
 

1741
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:25,109
energy and so when that goes wrong it
goes really wrong and that those those

1742
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:25,119
goes really wrong and that those those
 

1743
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,000
goes really wrong and that those those
challenges that you see occur more

1744
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,010
challenges that you see occur more
 

1745
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:29,460
challenges that you see occur more
rarely so you don't get to learn as all

1746
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:29,470
rarely so you don't get to learn as all
 

1747
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:31,980
rarely so you don't get to learn as all
as quickly and there you know

1748
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:31,990
as quickly and there you know
 

1749
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:34,020
as quickly and there you know
incrementally more difficult than urban

1750
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:34,030
incrementally more difficult than urban
 

1751
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,030
incrementally more difficult than urban
driving but they're not easier than

1752
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:36,040
driving but they're not easier than
 

1753
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,730
driving but they're not easier than
urban driving and so I think this

1754
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:38,740
urban driving and so I think this
 

1755
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,849
urban driving and so I think this
happens in moderate speed urban

1756
00:37:41,849 --> 00:37:41,859
happens in moderate speed urban
 

1757
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:43,950
happens in moderate speed urban
environments because they're you know if

1758
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:43,960
environments because they're you know if
 

1759
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,079
environments because they're you know if
if two vehicles crash at 25 miles per

1760
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:46,089
if two vehicles crash at 25 miles per
 

1761
00:37:46,089 --> 00:37:48,390
if two vehicles crash at 25 miles per
hour it's not good but probably

1762
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:48,400
hour it's not good but probably
 

1763
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,200
hour it's not good but probably
everybody walks away

1764
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:51,210
everybody walks away
 

1765
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,970
everybody walks away
those those events where there's the

1766
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:52,980
those those events where there's the
 

1767
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,710
those those events where there's the
possibility for that occurring happened

1768
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:54,720
possibility for that occurring happened
 

1769
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,200
possibility for that occurring happened
frequently so we get to learn more

1770
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:57,210
frequently so we get to learn more
 

1771
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,150
frequently so we get to learn more
rapidly we get to do that with lower

1772
00:37:59,150 --> 00:37:59,160
rapidly we get to do that with lower
 

1773
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,930
rapidly we get to do that with lower
risk for everyone and then we can

1774
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:02,940
risk for everyone and then we can
 

1775
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,730
risk for everyone and then we can
deliver value to people that they need

1776
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:04,740
deliver value to people that they need
 

1777
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,780
deliver value to people that they need
to get from one place to another and

1778
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:05,790
to get from one place to another and
 

1779
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:08,599
to get from one place to another and
then once we've got that solved then the

1780
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:08,609
then once we've got that solved then the
 

1781
00:38:08,609 --> 00:38:09,890
then once we've got that solved then the
kind of the freeway driving part of this

1782
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:09,900
kind of the freeway driving part of this
 

1783
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,050
kind of the freeway driving part of this
just falls out but we were able to learn

1784
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:12,060
just falls out but we were able to learn
 

1785
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,760
just falls out but we were able to learn
it's more safely more quickly in the

1786
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:13,770
it's more safely more quickly in the
 

1787
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:16,250
it's more safely more quickly in the
urban environment so ten years and then

1788
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:16,260
urban environment so ten years and then
 

1789
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,859
urban environment so ten years and then
scale twenty thirty year I mean who

1790
00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:18,869
scale twenty thirty year I mean who
 

1791
00:38:18,869 --> 00:38:21,290
scale twenty thirty year I mean who
knows if if it's sufficiently compelling

1792
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:21,300
knows if if it's sufficiently compelling
 

1793
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,480
knows if if it's sufficiently compelling
experience is created it can be faster

1794
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:23,490
experience is created it can be faster
 

1795
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:26,020
experience is created it can be faster
and slower do you think there could be

1796
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:26,030
and slower do you think there could be
 

1797
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,890
and slower do you think there could be
breakthroughs and what kind of break

1798
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:27,900
breakthroughs and what kind of break
 

1799
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,500
breakthroughs and what kind of break
throughs might there be that completely

1800
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:30,510
throughs might there be that completely
 

1801
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:33,470
throughs might there be that completely
changed that timeline again not only am

1802
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:33,480
changed that timeline again not only am
 

1803
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,240

I asked to predict the future oh yeah

1804
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:35,250
I asked to predict the future oh yeah
 

1805
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,250
I asked to predict the future oh yeah
I'm asking you to predict breakthroughs

1806
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:37,260
I'm asking you to predict breakthroughs
 

1807
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,930
I'm asking you to predict breakthroughs
that haven't happened yet so what's the

1808
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:38,940
that haven't happened yet so what's the
 

1809
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,880
that haven't happened yet so what's the
I think another way to ask that was

1810
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:40,890
I think another way to ask that was
 

1811
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:43,540
I think another way to ask that was
would be if I could wave a magic wand

1812
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:43,550
would be if I could wave a magic wand
 

1813
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,620
would be if I could wave a magic wand
what part of the system would I make

1814
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:45,630
what part of the system would I make
 

1815
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,870
what part of the system would I make
work today to accelerate it as quick as

00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:47,880
work today to accelerate it as quick as
 

1817
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,280
work today to accelerate it as quick as
possible as quickly as possible

00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,540

don't say infrastructure please don't

1820
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:53,550
don't say infrastructure please don't
 

1821
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,770
don't say infrastructure please don't
say infrastruc no it's definitely not

1822
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:54,780
say infrastruc no it's definitely not
 

1823
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,589
say infrastruc no it's definitely not
infrastructure it's really that car that

1824
00:38:57,589 --> 00:38:57,599
infrastructure it's really that car that
 

1825

infrastructure it's really that car that
perception forecasting capability so if

1826
00:39:00,859 --> 00:39:00,869
perception forecasting capability so if
 

1827
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:04,130
perception forecasting capability so if
if tomorrow you could give me a perfect

1828
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:04,140
if tomorrow you could give me a perfect
 

1829
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,380
if tomorrow you could give me a perfect
model of what's happened what is

1830
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:06,390
model of what's happened what is
 

1831
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,730
model of what's happened what is
happening and what will happen for the

1832
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:07,740
happening and what will happen for the
 

1833
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:11,480
happening and what will happen for the
next five seconds around a vehicle on

1834
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:11,490
next five seconds around a vehicle on
 

1835
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:13,880
next five seconds around a vehicle on
the roadway that would accelerate things

1836
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:13,890
the roadway that would accelerate things
 

1837
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:16,640
the roadway that would accelerate things
pretty dramatically how you in terms of

1838
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:16,650
pretty dramatically how you in terms of
 

1839
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,170
pretty dramatically how you in terms of
staying up at night are you mostly

1840
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:18,180
staying up at night are you mostly
 

1841
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:21,380
staying up at night are you mostly
bothered by cars pedestrians or cyclists

1842
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:21,390
bothered by cars pedestrians or cyclists
 

1843
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:25,339
bothered by cars pedestrians or cyclists
so I I worry most about the vulnerable

1844
00:39:25,339 --> 00:39:25,349
so I I worry most about the vulnerable
 

1845
00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:26,750
so I I worry most about the vulnerable
road users about the combination of

1846
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:26,760
road users about the combination of
 

1847
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,640
road users about the combination of
cyclists and cars right just because I

1848
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:28,650
cyclists and cars right just because I
 

1849
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,829
cyclists and cars right just because I
khlyst and pedestrians because you know

1850
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:30,839
khlyst and pedestrians because you know
 

1851
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:33,349
khlyst and pedestrians because you know
they're not in armor you know with the

1852
00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:33,359
they're not in armor you know with the
 

1853
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,940
they're not in armor you know with the
cars they're bigger

1854
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:34,950
cars they're bigger
 

1855
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,950
cars they're bigger
they've got protection for the people

1856
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:36,960
they've got protection for the people
 

1857
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,839
they've got protection for the people
and so the ultimate risk is is lower

1858
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:38,849
and so the ultimate risk is is lower
 

1859
00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:40,620
and so the ultimate risk is is lower
there

1860
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:40,630
there
 

1861
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:43,359
there
whereas a pedestrian or cyclist they're

1862
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:43,369
whereas a pedestrian or cyclist they're
 

1863
00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:45,519
whereas a pedestrian or cyclist they're
out in the road you know they they don't

1864
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:45,529
out in the road you know they they don't
 

1865
00:39:45,529 --> 00:39:47,470
out in the road you know they they don't
have any protection and so you know we

1866
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:47,480
have any protection and so you know we
 

1867
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,809
have any protection and so you know we
need to pay extra attention to that do

1868
00:39:49,809 --> 00:39:49,819
need to pay extra attention to that do
 

1869
00:39:49,819 --> 00:39:52,349
need to pay extra attention to that do
you think about a very difficult

1870
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:52,359
you think about a very difficult
 

1871
00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:56,950
you think about a very difficult
technical challenge of the fact that

1872
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:56,960
technical challenge of the fact that
 

1873
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,589
technical challenge of the fact that
pedestrians if you try to protect

1874
00:39:59,589 --> 00:39:59,599
pedestrians if you try to protect
 

1875
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,190
pedestrians if you try to protect
pedestrians by being careful and slow

1876
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:02,200
pedestrians by being careful and slow
 

1877
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,870
pedestrians by being careful and slow
they'll take advantage of that so the

1878
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:04,880
they'll take advantage of that so the
 

1879
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,660
they'll take advantage of that so the
game theoretic dance yeah does that

1880
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:07,670
game theoretic dance yeah does that
 

1881
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:10,150
game theoretic dance yeah does that
worry you of how from a technical

1882
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:10,160
worry you of how from a technical
 

1883
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,730
worry you of how from a technical
perspective how we solve that because as

1884
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:12,740
perspective how we solve that because as
 

1885
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,890
perspective how we solve that because as
humans the way we solve that it's kind

1886
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:14,900
humans the way we solve that it's kind
 

1887
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,630
humans the way we solve that it's kind
of nudge our way through the pedestrians

1888
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:16,640
of nudge our way through the pedestrians
 

1889
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,210
of nudge our way through the pedestrians
which doesn't feel from a technical

1890
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:19,220
which doesn't feel from a technical
 

1891
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:22,349
which doesn't feel from a technical
perspective as a appropriate algorithm

1892
00:40:22,349 --> 00:40:22,359
perspective as a appropriate algorithm
 

1893
00:40:22,359 --> 00:40:24,940
perspective as a appropriate algorithm
but do you think about how we solve that

1894
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:24,950
but do you think about how we solve that
 

1895
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:27,480
but do you think about how we solve that
problem yeah I think I think there's

1896
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:27,490
problem yeah I think I think there's
 

1897
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:29,710
problem yeah I think I think there's
there's I think that was actually

1898
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:29,720
there's I think that was actually
 

1899
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,509
there's I think that was actually
there's two different concepts there so

1900
00:40:31,509 --> 00:40:31,519
there's two different concepts there so
 

1901
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:35,380
there's two different concepts there so
one is am I worried that because these

1902
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:35,390
one is am I worried that because these
 

1903
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,029
one is am I worried that because these
vehicles are self-driving people kind of

1904
00:40:37,029 --> 00:40:37,039
vehicles are self-driving people kind of
 

1905
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:38,380
vehicles are self-driving people kind of
step in the road and take advantage of

1906
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:38,390
step in the road and take advantage of
 

1907
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:42,249
step in the road and take advantage of
them and I've heard this and I don't

1908
00:40:42,249 --> 00:40:42,259
them and I've heard this and I don't
 

1909
00:40:42,259 --> 00:40:45,430
them and I've heard this and I don't
really believe it because if I'm driving

1910
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:45,440
really believe it because if I'm driving
 

1911
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,660
really believe it because if I'm driving
down the road and somebody steps in

1912
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:46,670
down the road and somebody steps in
 

1913
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:49,269
down the road and somebody steps in
front of me I'm going to stop right like

1914
00:40:49,269 --> 00:40:49,279
front of me I'm going to stop right like
 

1915
00:40:49,279 --> 00:40:53,229
front of me I'm going to stop right like
a even if I'm annoyed I'm not going to

1916
00:40:53,229 --> 00:40:53,239
a even if I'm annoyed I'm not going to
 

1917
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:54,489
a even if I'm annoyed I'm not going to
just drive through a person stood on the

1918
00:40:54,489 --> 00:40:54,499
just drive through a person stood on the
 

1919
00:40:54,499 --> 00:40:59,349
just drive through a person stood on the
road right and so I think today people

1920
00:40:59,349 --> 00:40:59,359
road right and so I think today people
 

1921
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:00,700
road right and so I think today people
can take advantage of this and you and

1922
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:00,710
can take advantage of this and you and
 

1923
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:02,979
can take advantage of this and you and
you do see some people do it I guess

1924
00:41:02,979 --> 00:41:02,989
you do see some people do it I guess
 

1925
00:41:02,989 --> 00:41:04,390
you do see some people do it I guess
there's an incremental risk because

1926
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:04,400
there's an incremental risk because
 

1927
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,979
there's an incremental risk because
maybe they have lower confidence that

1928
00:41:05,979 --> 00:41:05,989
maybe they have lower confidence that
 

1929
00:41:05,989 --> 00:41:07,029
maybe they have lower confidence that
I'm going to see them than they might

1930
00:41:07,029 --> 00:41:07,039
I'm going to see them than they might
 

1931
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:09,489
I'm going to see them than they might
have for an automated vehicle and so

1932
00:41:09,489 --> 00:41:09,499
have for an automated vehicle and so
 

1933
00:41:09,499 --> 00:41:11,220
have for an automated vehicle and so
maybe that shifts it a little bit I

1934
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:11,230
maybe that shifts it a little bit I
 

1935
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:13,059
maybe that shifts it a little bit I
think people don't want to get hit by

1936
00:41:13,059 --> 00:41:13,069
think people don't want to get hit by
 

1937
00:41:13,069 --> 00:41:16,630
think people don't want to get hit by
cars and so I think that I'm not that

1938
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:16,640
cars and so I think that I'm not that
 

1939
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,220
cars and so I think that I'm not that
worried about people walking out of the

1940
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:18,230
worried about people walking out of the
 

1941
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:20,620
worried about people walking out of the
101 and you know creating chaos more

1942
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:20,630
101 and you know creating chaos more
 

1943
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:25,299
101 and you know creating chaos more
than they would today regarding kind of

1944
00:41:25,299 --> 00:41:25,309
than they would today regarding kind of
 

1945
00:41:25,309 --> 00:41:27,069
than they would today regarding kind of
the nudging through a big stream of

1946
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:27,079
the nudging through a big stream of
 

1947
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:28,450
the nudging through a big stream of
pedestrians leaving a concert or

1948
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:28,460
pedestrians leaving a concert or
 

1949
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:31,960
pedestrians leaving a concert or
something I think that is further down

1950
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:31,970
something I think that is further down
 

1951
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:34,329
something I think that is further down
the technology pipeline I think that

1952
00:41:34,329 --> 00:41:34,339
the technology pipeline I think that
 

1953
00:41:34,339 --> 00:41:37,390
the technology pipeline I think that
you're right that's tricky I don't think

1954
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:37,400
you're right that's tricky I don't think
 

1955
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,989
you're right that's tricky I don't think
it's necessarily I think the algorithm

1956
00:41:40,989 --> 00:41:40,999
it's necessarily I think the algorithm
 

1957
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,190
it's necessarily I think the algorithm
people use for this is pretty simple

1958
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:42,200
people use for this is pretty simple
 

1959
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,170
people use for this is pretty simple
Yeah right it's kind of just move

1960
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:44,180
Yeah right it's kind of just move
 

1961
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,460
Yeah right it's kind of just move
forward slowly and if somebody's really

1962
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:45,470
forward slowly and if somebody's really
 

1963
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:49,329
forward slowly and if somebody's really
close and stop and and I think that that

1964
00:41:49,329 --> 00:41:49,339
close and stop and and I think that that
 

1965
00:41:49,339 --> 00:41:51,819
close and stop and and I think that that
probably can be replicated pretty pretty

1966
00:41:51,819 --> 00:41:51,829
probably can be replicated pretty pretty
 

1967
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:54,070
probably can be replicated pretty pretty
easily and particularly given that it's

1968
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:54,080
easily and particularly given that it's
 

1969
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,600
easily and particularly given that it's
you don't do this at 30 miles an hour

1970
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:55,610
you don't do this at 30 miles an hour
 

1971
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:58,450
you don't do this at 30 miles an hour
you do it at one that even in those

1972
00:41:58,450 --> 00:41:58,460
you do it at one that even in those
 

1973
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,190
you do it at one that even in those
situations the risk is relatively

1974
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:00,200
situations the risk is relatively
 

1975
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,350
situations the risk is relatively
minimal but I you know it's not

1976
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:02,360
minimal but I you know it's not
 

1977
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,760
minimal but I you know it's not
something we're thinking about in any

1978
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:03,770
something we're thinking about in any
 

1979
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:06,970
something we're thinking about in any
serious way and probably the that's less

1980
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:06,980
serious way and probably the that's less
 

1981
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,610
serious way and probably the that's less
an algorithm problem or creating a human

1982
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:09,620
an algorithm problem or creating a human
 

1983
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,340
an algorithm problem or creating a human
experience so they see AI people that

1984
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:12,350
experience so they see AI people that
 

1985
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:14,710
experience so they see AI people that
create a visual display that you're

1986
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:14,720
create a visual display that you're
 

1987
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,840
create a visual display that you're

the way yes that's a that's a yeah

1990
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:19,160
the way yes that's a that's a yeah
 

1991
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,040
the way yes that's a that's a yeah
that's an experienced problem not an

00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:21,050
that's an experienced problem not an

competitor to Arora today and how do you

1996
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:26,210
competitor to Arora today and how do you
 

1997
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,870
competitor to Arora today and how do you
out-compete them in the long run so we

1998
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:28,880
out-compete them in the long run so we
 

1999
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,640
out-compete them in the long run so we
really focus a lot of what we're doing

2000
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:30,650
really focus a lot of what we're doing
 

2001
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:33,640
really focus a lot of what we're doing
here I think that you know I've said

2002
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:33,650
here I think that you know I've said
 

2003
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:36,160
here I think that you know I've said
this a few times that this is a huge

2004
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:36,170
this a few times that this is a huge
 

2005
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:38,830
this a few times that this is a huge
difficult problem and it's great that a

2006
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:38,840
difficult problem and it's great that a
 

2007
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,210
difficult problem and it's great that a
bunch of companies are tackling it

2008
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:40,220
bunch of companies are tackling it
 

2009
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,710
bunch of companies are tackling it
because I think it's so important for

2010
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:41,720
because I think it's so important for
 

2011
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,610
because I think it's so important for
society that somebody gets there so we

2012
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:45,620
society that somebody gets there so we
 

2013
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,500
society that somebody gets there so we
you know we're we don't spend a whole

2014
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:47,510
you know we're we don't spend a whole
 

2015
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:50,440
you know we're we don't spend a whole
lot of time like thinking tactically

2016
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:50,450
lot of time like thinking tactically
 

2017
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:52,510
lot of time like thinking tactically
about who's out there and and how do we

2018
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:52,520
about who's out there and and how do we
 

2019
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,660
about who's out there and and how do we
beat that that that person individually

2020
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:54,670
beat that that that person individually
 

2021
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:57,940
beat that that that person individually
what are we trying to do to go faster

2022
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:57,950
what are we trying to do to go faster
 

2023
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,810
what are we trying to do to go faster
ultimately well part of it is the

2024
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:01,820
ultimately well part of it is the
 

2025
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,160
ultimately well part of it is the
leadership team we have has got pretty

2026
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:03,170
leadership team we have has got pretty
 

2027
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:05,200
leadership team we have has got pretty
tremendous experience and so we kind of

2028
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:05,210
tremendous experience and so we kind of
 

2029
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:07,480
tremendous experience and so we kind of
understand the landscape and understand

2030
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:07,490
understand the landscape and understand
 

2031
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:08,770
understand the landscape and understand
where the coldest acts are to some

2032
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:08,780
where the coldest acts are to some
 

2033
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,180
where the coldest acts are to some
degree and you know we try and avoid

2034
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:10,190
degree and you know we try and avoid
 

2035
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:14,230
degree and you know we try and avoid
those I think there's a part of it just

2036
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:14,240
those I think there's a part of it just
 

2037

this great team we've built people this
 

2039
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:19,180
this great team we've built people this
is a technology and a company that

2040
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:19,190
is a technology and a company that
 

2041
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:22,720
is a technology and a company that
people believe in the mission of and so

2042
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:22,730
people believe in the mission of and so
 

2043

it allows us to attract just awesome
people to go work we've got a culture I

2046
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:27,680
people to go work we've got a culture I
 

2047
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,620
people to go work we've got a culture I
think that people appreciate that allows

2048
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:29,630
think that people appreciate that allows
 

2049
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:30,940

them to focus allows them to really

2050
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:30,950
them to focus allows them to really
 

2051
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:33,610
them to focus allows them to really
spend time solving problems and I think

2052
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:33,620
spend time solving problems and I think
 

2053
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:36,580
spend time solving problems and I think
that keeps them energized and then we've

2054
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:36,590
that keeps them energized and then we've
 

2055
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:42,090
that keeps them energized and then we've
invested hard invested heavily in the

2056
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:42,100
invested hard invested heavily in the
 

2057
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,920
invested hard invested heavily in the
infrastructure and architectures that we

2058
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:44,930
infrastructure and architectures that we
 

2059
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:46,720
infrastructure and architectures that we
think will ultimately accelerate us so

2060
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:46,730
think will ultimately accelerate us so
 

2061
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:49,930
think will ultimately accelerate us so
because of the folks were able to bring

2062
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:49,940
because of the folks were able to bring
 

2063
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:51,790
because of the folks were able to bring
in early on because the the the great

2064
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:51,800
in early on because the the the great
 

2065
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,070
in early on because the the the great
investors we have you know we don't

2066
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:54,080
investors we have you know we don't
 

2067
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,470
investors we have you know we don't
spend all of our time doing demos and

2068
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:56,480
spend all of our time doing demos and
 

2069
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,360
spend all of our time doing demos and
kind of leaping from one demo to the

2070
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:58,370
kind of leaping from one demo to the
 

2071
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:00,870
kind of leaping from one demo to the
next we've been given the freedom to

2072
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:00,880
next we've been given the freedom to
 

2073
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,940
next we've been given the freedom to
invest in

2074
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:03,950
invest in
 

2075
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:05,190

that to accelerate engineering and I

2082
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:11,839
that to accelerate engineering and I
 

2083
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,440
that to accelerate engineering and I
think that that early investment and

continuing investment and those kind of
 

2087
00:44:16,369 --> 00:44:18,549
continuing investment and those kind of
tools will ultimately allow us to

2088
00:44:18,549 --> 00:44:18,559
tools will ultimately allow us to
 

2089
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,069
tools will ultimately allow us to
accelerate and do something pretty

2090
00:44:21,069 --> 00:44:21,079
accelerate and do something pretty
 

2091
