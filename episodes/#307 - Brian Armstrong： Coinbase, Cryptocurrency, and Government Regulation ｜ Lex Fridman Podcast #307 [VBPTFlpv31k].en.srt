world app in java

170
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,160
world app in java
 

171
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,030
world app in java
but it was so i felt like i was so

172
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,040
but it was so i felt like i was so
 

173
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,229
but it was so i felt like i was so
confused about what was actually

174
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:52,239
confused about what was actually
 

175
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,229
confused about what was actually
happening that i later

176
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
happening that i later
 

177
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,869
happening that i later
learned a bit of php and php was like

178
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:56,879
learned a bit of php and php was like
 

179
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,309
learned a bit of php and php was like
more fun for me because it was like oh

180
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
more fun for me because it was like oh
 

181
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,390
more fun for me because it was like oh
just print out what you want you know it

182
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
just print out what you want you know it
 

183
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,830
just print out what you want you know it
didn't have all this complexity around

184
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:01,840
didn't have all this complexity around
 

185
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,550
didn't have all this complexity around
it so then i got more into php i started

186
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:04,560
it so then i got more into php i started
 

187
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,949
it so then i got more into php i started
building like some simple websites i

188
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:06,959
building like some simple websites i
 

189
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:07,830
building like some simple websites i
think

190
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:07,840
think
 

191
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,869
think
learned some html so i think that was my

192
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:10,879
learned some html so i think that was my
 

193
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,309
learned some html so i think that was my
introduction to programming at least the

194
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:12,319
introduction to programming at least the
 

195
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,149
introduction to programming at least the
very beginning part yeah

196
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:14,159
very beginning part yeah
 

197
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,309
very beginning part yeah
you know java has a lot of uh

198
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:18,319
you know java has a lot of uh
 

199
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,670
you know java has a lot of uh
out of all the hello worlds you can

200
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
out of all the hello worlds you can
 

201
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,990
out of all the hello worlds you can
possibly write java is the one where i

202
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,000
possibly write java is the one where i
 

203
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,070
possibly write java is the one where i
think it's the longest yeah it's just

204
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,080
think it's the longest yeah it's just
 

205
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,509
think it's the longest yeah it's just
which is quite interesting because java

206
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:25,519
which is quite interesting because java
 

207
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,190
which is quite interesting because java
is often at least for a long time was

208
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,200
is often at least for a long time was
 

209
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,110
is often at least for a long time was
used as the primary programming language

210
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,120
used as the primary programming language
 

211
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,869
used as the primary programming language
to teach people how to program or at

212
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:30,879
to teach people how to program or at
 

213
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,630
to teach people how to program or at
least about object-oriented programming

214
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
least about object-oriented programming
 

215
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,550
least about object-oriented programming
i think most universities have now

216
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
i think most universities have now
 

217
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,149
i think most universities have now
switched in high school switched to

218
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:36,159
switched in high school switched to
 

219
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,190
switched in high school switched to
python

220
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200
python
 

221
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,030
python
i'm not sure if that's the case probably

222
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,040
i'm not sure if that's the case probably
 

223
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,710
i'm not sure if that's the case probably
better it's easier to learn it lowers

224
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:40,720
better it's easier to learn it lowers
 

225
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,470
better it's easier to learn it lowers
the it makes it less scary there's like

226
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
the it makes it less scary there's like
 

227
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,309
the it makes it less scary there's like
less of a hurdle and certainly none of

228
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
less of a hurdle and certainly none of
 

229
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,110
less of a hurdle and certainly none of
them use php i love php and i feel like

230
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,120
them use php i love php and i feel like
 

231
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,830
them use php i love php and i feel like
it's a dirty secret i have to keep

232
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:49,840
it's a dirty secret i have to keep
 

233
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,750
it's a dirty secret i have to keep
private to myself like it's somebody i'm

234
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
private to myself like it's somebody i'm
 

235
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,030
private to myself like it's somebody i'm
seeing on the side or something like

236
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
seeing on the side or something like
 

237
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,949
seeing on the side or something like
that because uh it's just not a

238
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:54,959
that because uh it's just not a
 

239
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,550
that because uh it's just not a
respected programming language because i

240
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:56,560
respected programming language because i
 

241
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,789
respected programming language because i
think there's so many ways you can write

242
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:58,799
think there's so many ways you can write
 

243
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,949
think there's so many ways you can write
poor code with php yeah which is why

244
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
poor code with php yeah which is why
 

245
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,949
poor code with php yeah which is why
it's not respected yeah it's a scripting

246
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:02,959
it's not respected yeah it's a scripting
 

247
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,470
it's not respected yeah it's a scripting
language more so although of course

248
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:04,480
language more so although of course
 

249
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,470
language more so although of course
facebook built like a huge stack on top

00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:10,480
i still love ruby to this day ruby is
 

255
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,630
i still love ruby to this day ruby is
probably my favorite language python is

256
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:12,640
probably my favorite language python is
 

257
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,550
probably my favorite language python is
great too but i just love

258
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:14,560
great too but i just love
 

259
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,150
great too but i just love
the idea behind ruby that it's like

260
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,160
the idea behind ruby that it's like
 

261
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,069
the idea behind ruby that it's like
let's make it easier for the human

262
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:18,079
let's make it easier for the human
 

263
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,150
let's make it easier for the human
harder for the computer and make it a

264
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:20,160
harder for the computer and make it a
 

265
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,150
harder for the computer and make it a
joy to be expressive and all these

266
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,160
joy to be expressive and all these
 

267
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,189
joy to be expressive and all these
things so

268
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
things so
 

269
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,710
things so
i was never the best computer scientist

270
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,720
i was never the best computer scientist
 

271
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,150
i was never the best computer scientist
but i was a good i was good hacker i

272
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,160
but i was a good i was good hacker i
 

273
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,629
but i was a good i was good hacker i
could rapidly prototype products and

274
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:28,639
could rapidly prototype products and
 

275
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,870
could rapidly prototype products and
using languages like ruby do a lot of

276
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
using languages like ruby do a lot of
 

277
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,270
using languages like ruby do a lot of
computer science programs still use like

278
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,280
computer science programs still use like
 

279
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,670
computer science programs still use like
lisp and scheme and things like that no

280
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
lisp and scheme and things like that no
 

281
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,230
lisp and scheme and things like that no
no they do for that's like that's if

282
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
no they do for that's like that's if
 

283
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,990
no they do for that's like that's if
you're hardcore if you're legit you're

284
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,000
you're hardcore if you're legit you're
 

285
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,110
you're hardcore if you're legit you're
gonna do some of the functional

286
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,120
gonna do some of the functional
 

287
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,350
gonna do some of the functional
languages yeah i think there's a there's

288
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
languages yeah i think there's a there's
 

289
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,590
languages yeah i think there's a there's
a few others that popped up but

290
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,600
a few others that popped up but
 

291
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,990
a few others that popped up but
lisp is a distant memory for a lot of

292
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
lisp is a distant memory for a lot of
 

293
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,749
lisp is a distant memory for a lot of
people that's like somebody has to like

294
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:49,759
people that's like somebody has to like
 

295
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,430
people that's like somebody has to like
you go to library

296
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:51,440
you go to library
 

297
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,629
you go to library
you dust off the book yeah but uh scheme

298
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:54,639
you dust off the book yeah but uh scheme
 

299
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,030
you dust off the book yeah but uh scheme
a little bit i think if you're starting

300
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,040
a little bit i think if you're starting
 

301
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,870
a little bit i think if you're starting
i mean there's courses about languages

302
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:58,880
i mean there's courses about languages
 

303
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,950
i mean there's courses about languages
themselves like programming languages

304
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:00,960
themselves like programming languages
 

305
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,110
themselves like programming languages
yeah this might be one of those you know

306
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
yeah this might be one of those you know
 

307
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,790
yeah this might be one of those you know
how there's languages that nobody uses

308
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:04,800
how there's languages that nobody uses
 

309
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,510
how there's languages that nobody uses
anymore like ancient languages yeah

310
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,520
anymore like ancient languages yeah
 

311
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,710
anymore like ancient languages yeah
you might have to go to school in that

312
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:08,720
you might have to go to school in that
 

313
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,469
you might have to go to school in that
same way for programming languages yeah

314
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:10,479
same way for programming languages yeah
 

315
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,749
same way for programming languages yeah
back in the day we used to use

316
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:11,759
back in the day we used to use
 

317
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,950
back in the day we used to use
parentheses i of course still use emacs

318
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:14,960
parentheses i of course still use emacs
 

319
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,350
parentheses i of course still use emacs
as the editor for most things that i do

320
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,360
as the editor for most things that i do
 

321
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,870
as the editor for most things that i do
and emacs is is um you know a lot of the

322
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
and emacs is is um you know a lot of the
 

323
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,270
and emacs is is um you know a lot of the
customization you can do is in lisp

324
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
customization you can do is in lisp
 

325
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,189
customization you can do is in lisp
and that's the language probably when i

326
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:25,199

such a beautiful functional language
but it just somehow didn't pick up

348

php i feel like
 

355
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,270
php i feel like
it's still true that most of the

356
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280
it's still true that most of the
 

357
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,749
it's still true that most of the
web runs on php most of the back end is

358
00:05:59,749 --> 00:05:59,759
web runs on php most of the back end is
 

359
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,070
web runs on php most of the back end is
still is still php

360

yeah uh like power systems and

438
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:21,599
yeah uh like power systems and
 

439
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,589
yeah uh like power systems and
infrastructure systems which is

440

that we rely on that just works and the
 

447
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,629
that we rely on that just works and the
reason we don't change it because it

get get the stuff that's like tech that
 

459
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,309
get get the stuff that's like tech that
was invented

460
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:42,319
was invented
 

461
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,869

okay so you know basically in any given

518
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,000
okay so you know basically in any given
 

519
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,750
okay so you know basically in any given
market there's some people want to buy

some people who want to sell
 

523
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,350
some people who want to sell
and there's you keep an order book of

524
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,360
and there's you keep an order book of
 

525
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,190
and there's you keep an order book of
all those prices

526
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,200
all those prices
 

527
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,030
all those prices
and then um

528
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,040
and then um
 

529
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,430
and then um

you know if someone's willing to buy for
more than the lowest price someone's

532
00:08:59,190 --> 00:08:59,200
more than the lowest price someone's
 

533
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,110
more than the lowest price someone's
willing to sell then you know you get a

this ecosystem
we have to work on cyber security a lot

572
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:33,519
we have to work on cyber security a lot
 

573
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,190
we have to work on cyber security a lot
there's lots of hackers out there trying

574
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,200
there's lots of hackers out there trying
 

575
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,550
there's lots of hackers out there trying
to break into our systems and steal

576
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,560
to break into our systems and steal
 

577
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,110
to break into our systems and steal
crypto or to put stolen credit cards and

578
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,120
crypto or to put stolen credit cards and

bank accounts and things like that into
 

581
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,310
bank accounts and things like that into
these systems

582
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
these systems
 

583
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,670
these systems
um we have to integrate with the

584
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:43,680
um we have to integrate with the
 

585
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,870
um we have to integrate with the
blockchains themselves right which are

586
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:46,880
blockchains themselves right which are
 

587
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,030
blockchains themselves right which are
periodically getting updated and

588
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,040
periodically getting updated and
 

589
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,949
periodically getting updated and
having various airdrops and all kinds of

590
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:50,959
having various airdrops and all kinds of
 

591
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,070
having various airdrops and all kinds of
things so we're integrated with lots of

592
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:52,080
things so we're integrated with lots of
 

593
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,670
things so we're integrated with lots of
different blockchains and then we have

594
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:53,680
different blockchains and then we have
 

595
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,269
different blockchains and then we have
to store the crypto that people buy

596
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:55,279
to store the crypto that people buy
 

597
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,910
to store the crypto that people buy
securely as well so crypto is kind of

598
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:57,920
securely as well so crypto is kind of
 

599
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,190
securely as well so crypto is kind of
like storing

600
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,200
like storing
 

601
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,710
like storing
you store the private keys essentially

602
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:00,720
you store the private keys essentially
 

603
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,389
you store the private keys essentially
and we've invented a lot of cool

604
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:02,399
and we've invented a lot of cool
 

605
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,630
and we've invented a lot of cool
technology about how to do that securely

606
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:04,640
technology about how to do that securely
 

607
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,790
technology about how to do that securely

um yeah okay so you've gotten a lot
like

696
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:28,880
like
 

697
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,150
like
you know when you press the button on

698
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,160
you know when you press the button on
 

699
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,990
you know when you press the button on
your keyboard like the electrical signal

700
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,000
your keyboard like the electrical signal
 

701
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,710
your keyboard like the electrical signal
goes up the wire on your keyboard

702
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:34,720
goes up the wire on your keyboard
 

703
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,310
goes up the wire on your keyboard
well that's also important the timing

704
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:36,320
well that's also important the timing
 

705
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,630
well that's also important the timing
right because it's not pricing

706
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:38,640
right because it's not pricing
 

707
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,230
right because it's not pricing
yeah it's true it's giving you a quote

708
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:40,240
yeah it's true it's giving you a quote
 

709
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,710
yeah it's true it's giving you a quote
right that's that's um you know some

710
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:42,720
right that's that's um you know some
 

711
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,310
right that's that's um you know some
there's a whole concept of like slippage

712
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:44,320
there's a whole concept of like slippage
 

713
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,230
there's a whole concept of like slippage
and like by the time the quote is

714
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,240
and like by the time the quote is
 

715
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,670
and like by the time the quote is
executed

716
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:47,680
executed
 

717
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,590
executed
um if the price has moved too much like

718
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:49,600
um if the price has moved too much like
 

719
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,269
um if the price has moved too much like
we may reject it and you know there's

720
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:51,279
we may reject it and you know there's
 

721
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,030
we may reject it and you know there's
there's various things like that but how

722
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,040
there's various things like that but how
 

723
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,550
there's various things like that but how
do i i mean what's the simple version i

724
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:54,560
do i i mean what's the simple version i
 

725
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,150
do i i mean what's the simple version i
can give you so we you know we'll we'll

726
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
can give you so we you know we'll we'll
 

727
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,670
can give you so we you know we'll we'll
basically check the order book give you

728
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:57,680
basically check the order book give you
 

729
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,870
basically check the order book give you
a quote

730
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:58,880
a quote
 

731
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,030
a quote
it's good for some period of time or for

732
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,040
it's good for some period of time or for
 

733
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,509
it's good for some period of time or for
some amount of slippage and then

734
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:03,519
some amount of slippage and then
 

735
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,590
some amount of slippage and then
what's happening is we're initiating a

736
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:05,600
what's happening is we're initiating a
 

737
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,110
what's happening is we're initiating a
debit to your payment method whether

738
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,120
debit to your payment method whether
 

739
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,870
debit to your payment method whether
that's a credit card or a bank account

740
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:08,880
that's a credit card or a bank account
 

741
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,670
that's a credit card or a bank account
or

742
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:09,680
or
 

743
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,110
or
you know you're storing dollars or euros

744
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,120
you know you're storing dollars or euros
 

745
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,389
you know you're storing dollars or euros
or something on our platform there's

746
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:12,399
or something on our platform there's
 

747
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,910
or something on our platform there's
various payment methods so we're

748
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:13,920
various payment methods so we're
 

749
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,829
various payment methods so we're
basically debiting that and then we're

750
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:15,839
basically debiting that and then we're
 

751
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,230
basically debiting that and then we're
crediting you the crypto and uh we're

752
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,240
crediting you the crypto and uh we're
 

753
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,350
crediting you the crypto and uh we're
taking a fee for it too so um

754
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:21,360
taking a fee for it too so um
 

755
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,269
taking a fee for it too so um
that's fundamentally what's happening

756
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:23,279
that's fundamentally what's happening
 

757
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,870
that's fundamentally what's happening
underneath and then there's some

758
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:24,880
underneath and then there's some
 

759
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,870
underneath and then there's some
interesting slippage how do you how do

760
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:26,880
interesting slippage how do you how do
 

761
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,509
interesting slippage how do you how do
you calculate the uh how much slippage

762
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:29,519
you calculate the uh how much slippage
 

763
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,509
you calculate the uh how much slippage
is allowed like how do you how do you

764
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:31,519
is allowed like how do you how do you
 

765
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,870
is allowed like how do you how do you
know these things

766
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:32,880
know these things
 

767
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,230
know these things
you know because order books are

768
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:34,240
you know because order books are
 

769
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,990
you know because order books are
fascinating

770
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,000
fascinating
 

771
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,910
fascinating
you know the dynamics of that is pretty

772
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:37,920
you know the dynamics of that is pretty
 

773
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,910
you know the dynamics of that is pretty
interesting yeah and the little i know

774
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:39,920
interesting yeah and the little i know
 

775
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,310
interesting yeah and the little i know
about it yeah so

776
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,320
about it yeah so
 

777
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,670
about it yeah so
there's a lot of people like traders who

778
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:43,680
there's a lot of people like traders who
 

779
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,110
there's a lot of people like traders who
get super into this and like high

780
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,120
get super into this and like high
 

781
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,110
get super into this and like high
frequency traders and arbitrage and all

782
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,120
frequency traders and arbitrage and all
 

783
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,790

kinds of interesting topics flash boys

784
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:48,800
kinds of interesting topics flash boys
 

785
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,990
kinds of interesting topics flash boys
was like an interesting book on this

786
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,000
was like an interesting book on this
 

787
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,470
was like an interesting book on this
whole thing you want like access to

788
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,480
whole thing you want like access to
 

789
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,310
whole thing you want like access to
information the fastest sometimes even

790
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,320
information the fastest sometimes even
 

791
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,430
information the fastest sometimes even
putting your

792
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:55,440
putting your
 

793
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,710
putting your
you know your thing in the data center

794
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:56,720
you know your thing in the data center
 

795
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,470
you know your thing in the data center
right next to the thing we don't allow

796
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,480
right next to the thing we don't allow
 

797
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,990
right next to the thing we don't allow
that colo stuff because we want it to be

798
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,000
that colo stuff because we want it to be
 

799
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,110
that colo stuff because we want it to be
more democratized

800
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,120
more democratized
 

801
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,269
more democratized
but you know basically you give a let's

802
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
but you know basically you give a let's
 

803
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,710
but you know basically you give a let's
say we wanted to just keep it math

804
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
say we wanted to just keep it math
 

805
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,990
say we wanted to just keep it math
simple we want to charge a one percent

806
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,000
simple we want to charge a one percent
 

807
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,750
simple we want to charge a one percent
fee so if you're buying a hundred

808
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:09,760
fee so if you're buying a hundred
 

809
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,829
fee so if you're buying a hundred
dollars of bitcoin and we'll charge you

810
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:11,839
dollars of bitcoin and we'll charge you
 

811
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:12,949
dollars of bitcoin and we'll charge you
101

812
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:12,959
101
 

813
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,310
101
you know we've presented you the amount

814
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,320
you know we've presented you the amount
 

815
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,150
you know we've presented you the amount
of bitcoin you're going to get for 100

816
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,160
of bitcoin you're going to get for 100
 

817
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,990
of bitcoin you're going to get for 100
now let's say 10 seconds later you hit

818
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,000
now let's say 10 seconds later you hit
 

819
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,870
now let's say 10 seconds later you hit
accept we go to we go to fill the order

820
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:20,880
accept we go to we go to fill the order
 

821
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,470
accept we go to we go to fill the order
so it's going to be

822
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:22,480
so it's going to be
 

823
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,710
so it's going to be
some error bound around that one percent

824
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
some error bound around that one percent
 

825
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,310
some error bound around that one percent
fee right and if we think we're actually

826
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:26,320
fee right and if we think we're actually
 

827
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,750
fee right and if we think we're actually
losing money on the trade i think we'll

828
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:27,760
losing money on the trade i think we'll
 

829
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,829
losing money on the trade i think we'll
often reject it so some part of the fee

830
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:31,839
often reject it so some part of the fee
 

831
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,870
often reject it so some part of the fee
the slippage is incorporated into that

832
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:34,880
the slippage is incorporated into that
 

833
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,310
the slippage is incorporated into that
averaged over

834
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:36,320
averaged over
 

835
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,790
averaged over
a large number of people they just just

836
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:38,800
a large number of people they just just
 

837
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,230
a large number of people they just just
it's fascinating because like even just

838
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:40,240
it's fascinating because like even just
 

839
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,750
it's fascinating because like even just
like that little detail probably

840
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:41,760
like that little detail probably
 

841
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,550
like that little detail probably
requires a lot of experimentation yeah

842
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:44,560
requires a lot of experimentation yeah
 

843
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,550
requires a lot of experimentation yeah
and it's kind of like a giant bug bounty

844
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:46,560
and it's kind of like a giant bug bounty
 

845
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,310
and it's kind of like a giant bug bounty
out there because if you get it wrong

846
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,320
out there because if you get it wrong
 

847
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,110
out there because if you get it wrong
there's people who are going to

848
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:49,120
there's people who are going to
 

849
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,870
there's people who are going to
arbitrage that and we've we've had

850
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:50,880
arbitrage that and we've we've had
 

851
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,590
arbitrage that and we've we've had
people sort of pen test our systems in

852
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:53,600
people sort of pen test our systems in
 

853
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,470
people sort of pen test our systems in
you know really creative ways where like

854
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:56,480
you know really creative ways where like
 

855
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,910
you know really creative ways where like
um

856
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:57,920
um
 

857
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,230
um
they'll just fire like programmatically

858
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,240
they'll just fire like programmatically
 

859
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,150
they'll just fire like programmatically
with apis they'll fire off like a

860
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,160
with apis they'll fire off like a
 

861
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,910
with apis they'll fire off like a
million different quotes and look for

862
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:03,920
million different quotes and look for
 

863
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,189
million different quotes and look for
one of them that's out of bounds and

864
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:05,199
one of them that's out of bounds and
 

865
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,790
one of them that's out of bounds and
then actually take that money right

866
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:06,800
then actually take that money right
 

867
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,870
then actually take that money right
there and you know we get people doing

868
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:08,880
there and you know we get people doing
 

869
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,550
there and you know we get people doing
all kinds of crazy stuff but so how do

870
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:10,560
all kinds of crazy stuff but so how do
 

871
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,470
all kinds of crazy stuff but so how do
you protect against that how do you

872
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,480
you protect against that how do you
 

873
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,389
you protect against that how do you
protect so we'll talk about cyber

874
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:14,399
protect so we'll talk about cyber
 

875
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,230
protect so we'll talk about cyber
security in interesting ways but there's

876
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:16,240
security in interesting ways but there's
 

877
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,069
security in interesting ways but there's
a lot of clever people

878
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:18,079
a lot of clever people
 

879
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,790
a lot of clever people
trying to do clever things to earn

880
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:20,800
trying to do clever things to earn
 

881
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,470
trying to do clever things to earn
not even just to break into the system

882
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:22,480
not even just to break into the system
 

883
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,110
not even just to break into the system
but to earn an edge of some kind yeah in

884
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,120
but to earn an edge of some kind yeah in
 

885
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,150
but to earn an edge of some kind yeah in
the system

886
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,160
the system
 

887
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,069
the system
how do you uh how do you stay one step

888
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:28,079
how do you uh how do you stay one step
 

889
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,670
how do you uh how do you stay one step
ahead there's no silver bullet there's a

890
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:29,680
ahead there's no silver bullet there's a
 

891
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,670
ahead there's no silver bullet there's a
bunch of lead bullets right so it's it's

892
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:31,680
bunch of lead bullets right so it's it's
 

893
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,189
bunch of lead bullets right so it's it's
like

894
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:33,199
like
 

895
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,870
like
you know one thing we do is we just have

896
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:34,880
you know one thing we do is we just have
 

897
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,110
you know one thing we do is we just have
good test suites right so you're testing

898
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,120
good test suites right so you're testing
 

899
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,470
good test suites right so you're testing
every piece of code that goes out that's

900
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:38,480
every piece of code that goes out that's
 

901
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,150
every piece of code that goes out that's
like just common good best practice but

902
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,160
like just common good best practice but
 

903
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,069
like just common good best practice but
it's particularly important in financial

904
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:42,079
it's particularly important in financial
 

905
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,509
it's particularly important in financial
services

906
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:43,519
services
 

907
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,710
services
another thing we do is we hire

908
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:44,720
another thing we do is we hire
 

909
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,629
another thing we do is we hire
third-party firms to try to audit this

910
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:46,639
third-party firms to try to audit this
 

911
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,710
third-party firms to try to audit this
stuff and break in another one we do is

912
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:48,720
stuff and break in another one we do is
 

913
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,189
stuff and break in another one we do is
we have a bug bounty program

914
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:51,199
we have a bug bounty program
 

915
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:51,990
we have a bug bounty program
so

916
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
so
 

917
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,710
so
we

918
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:52,720
we
 

919
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,870
we
basically pay white hat hackers to find

920
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880
basically pay white hat hackers to find
 

921
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,910
basically pay white hat hackers to find
this stuff before the black hats do and

922
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:57,920
this stuff before the black hats do and
 

923
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,670
this stuff before the black hats do and
we've paid out lots of good bug bounties

924
00:14:59,670 --> 00:14:59,680
we've paid out lots of good bug bounties
 

925
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,790
we've paid out lots of good bug bounties
so

926
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:00,800
so
 

927
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,750
so
you know

928
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:01,760
you know
 

929
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,110
you know
try all the above and occasionally you

930
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,120
try all the above and occasionally you
 

931
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,470
try all the above and occasionally you
don't get it right you lose some money

932
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:04,480
don't get it right you lose some money
 

933
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,910
don't get it right you lose some money
and then you fix it and you keep going

934
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:05,920
and then you fix it and you keep going
 

935
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,710
and then you fix it and you keep going
so

936
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:06,720
so
 

937
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,790
so
yeah let's talk about sebastian security

938
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:08,800
yeah let's talk about sebastian security
 

939
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,629
yeah let's talk about sebastian security
a little bit more yeah you mentioned

940
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:10,639
a little bit more yeah you mentioned
 

941
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,389
a little bit more yeah you mentioned
using stolen bank accounts

942
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:12,399
using stolen bank accounts
 

943
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,069
using stolen bank accounts
yeah so that's another one that's

944
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:14,079
yeah so that's another one that's
 

945
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,430
yeah so that's another one that's
another interesting one how do you

946
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:15,440
another interesting one how do you
 

947
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,350
another interesting one how do you
protect against that

948
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:17,360
protect against that
 

949
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,350
protect against that
okay so fraud prevention

950
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:19,360
okay so fraud prevention
 

951
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,829
okay so fraud prevention
yeah is a big topic so one of the

952
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:21,839
yeah is a big topic so one of the
 

953
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,990
yeah is a big topic so one of the
there's a lot of things people do but

954
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,000
there's a lot of things people do but
 

955
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,870
there's a lot of things people do but
one of the things they do is that

956
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:26,880
one of the things they do is that
 

957
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,310
one of the things they do is that
you use machine learning right so you

958
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,320
you use machine learning right so you
 

959
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,509
you use machine learning right so you
look at

960
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:29,519
look at
 

961
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,150
look at
protector to attack to protect against

962
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,160
protector to attack to protect against
 

963
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,269
protector to attack to protect against
it so

964
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:33,279
it so
 

965
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,269
it so
um what you want to do is kind of build

966
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:35,279
um what you want to do is kind of build
 

967
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,910
um what you want to do is kind of build
up a labeled data set of

968
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:37,920
up a labeled data set of
 

969
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,150
up a labeled data set of
all the different people who have turned

970
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,160
all the different people who have turned
 

971
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,749
all the different people who have turned
out to be fraudulent and good good

972
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:41,759
out to be fraudulent and good good
 

973
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,509
out to be fraudulent and good good
actors and hopefully collect as much

974
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:43,519
actors and hopefully collect as much
 

975
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,710
actors and hopefully collect as much
data as you can and then you'll you know

976
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:44,720
data as you can and then you'll you know
 

977
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,310
data as you can and then you'll you know
you might feed hundreds or thousands of

978
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,320
you might feed hundreds or thousands of
 

979
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,110
you might feed hundreds or thousands of
these factors into your machine learning

980
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:49,120
these factors into your machine learning
 

981
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,509
these factors into your machine learning
model it'll come back with a risk score

982
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:51,519
model it'll come back with a risk score
 

983
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,829
model it'll come back with a risk score
so you know an example of like the kinds

984
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:53,839
so you know an example of like the kinds
 

985
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,069
so you know an example of like the kinds
of factors people create or put in there

986
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:56,079
of factors people create or put in there
 

987
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:56,949
of factors people create or put in there
you know obviously i don't want to

988
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:56,959
you know obviously i don't want to
 

989
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,230
you know obviously i don't want to
disclose too many of them because it's

990
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:58,240
disclose too many of them because it's
 

991
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,389
disclose too many of them because it's
it's it's a cat and mouse game but just

992
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:00,399
it's it's a cat and mouse game but just
 

993
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,910
it's it's a cat and mouse game but just
kind of i don't know relatively well

994
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:01,920
kind of i don't know relatively well
 

995
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,749
kind of i don't know relatively well
known stuff might be

996
00:16:03,749 --> 00:16:03,759
known stuff might be
 

997
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,030
known stuff might be
um

998
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,040
um
 

999
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,470
um
you know you have device fingerprints

1000
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:06,480
you know you have device fingerprints
 

1001
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,389
you know you have device fingerprints
right so like what kind of device are

1002
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
right so like what kind of device are
 

1003
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,590
right so like what kind of device are
you on and what fonts do you have

1004
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:09,600
you on and what fonts do you have
 

1005
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,030
you on and what fonts do you have
installed a lot of people who are

1006
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,040
installed a lot of people who are
 

1007
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,310
installed a lot of people who are
farming lots of these accounts they're

1008
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:12,320
farming lots of these accounts they're
 

1009
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,069
farming lots of these accounts they're
using emulators and like virtual

1010
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:14,079
using emulators and like virtual
 

1011
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,150
using emulators and like virtual
machines and stuff they're not like you

1012
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,160
machines and stuff they're not like you
 

1013
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,470
machines and stuff they're not like you
know an average person on that device

1014
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:18,480
know an average person on that device
 

1015
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,030
know an average person on that device
um and then you'll see sometimes like

1016
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,040
um and then you'll see sometimes like
 

1017
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,470
um and then you'll see sometimes like
one of my favorite metrics we tracked

1018
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:22,480
one of my favorite metrics we tracked
 

1019
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,550
one of my favorite metrics we tracked
for for this was called like improbable

1020
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:24,560
for for this was called like improbable
 

1021
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,870
for for this was called like improbable
travel velocity so we would we're

1022
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:26,880
travel velocity so we would we're
 

1023
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,110
travel velocity so we would we're
tracking people's ips right and you

1024
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,120
tracking people's ips right and you
 

1025
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,189
tracking people's ips right and you
might see someone um

1026
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:31,199
might see someone um
 

1027
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,509
might see someone um
who was one day in austin texas and then

1028
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:33,519
who was one day in austin texas and then
 

1029
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,590
who was one day in austin texas and then
like an hour later they were in london

1030
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:35,600
like an hour later they were in london
 

1031
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,870
like an hour later they were in london
or something it's like well that's very

1032
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:36,880
or something it's like well that's very
 

1033
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,550
or something it's like well that's very
improbable i mean sometimes people are

1034
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:38,560
improbable i mean sometimes people are
 

1035
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,150
improbable i mean sometimes people are
using vpns so you got to be careful with

1036
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,160
using vpns so you got to be careful with
 

1037
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,509
using vpns so you got to be careful with
that because like there's legitimate

1038
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:41,519
that because like there's legitimate
 

1039
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,790
that because like there's legitimate
people who use vpns too but

1040
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:44,800
people who use vpns too but
 

1041
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,990
people who use vpns too but
if it's not possible for them to have

1042
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,000
if it's not possible for them to have
 

1043
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,110
if it's not possible for them to have
gotten on a plane and gotten there that

1044
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:47,120
gotten on a plane and gotten there that
 

1045
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,710
gotten on a plane and gotten there that
quickly then that's usually they're like

1046
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:48,720
quickly then that's usually they're like
 

1047
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,790
quickly then that's usually they're like
spoofing a device or ip sometimes those

1048
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:50,800
spoofing a device or ip sometimes those
 

1049
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,870
spoofing a device or ip sometimes those
are interesting factors but yeah if you

1050
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:52,880
are interesting factors but yeah if you
 

1051
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,350
are interesting factors but yeah if you
feed enough of these in um

1052
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,360
feed enough of these in um
 

1053
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,350
feed enough of these in um
you will oh oh the another fun one is

1054
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:57,360
you will oh oh the another fun one is
 

1055
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,629
you will oh oh the another fun one is
like

1056
00:16:58,629 --> 00:16:58,639
like
 

1057
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,870
like
you know real users will type their

1058
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:00,880
you know real users will type their
 

1059
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,189
you know real users will type their
credit card like one number at a time

1060
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:03,199
credit card like one number at a time
 

1061
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,189
credit card like one number at a time
yeah scammers have a list of them and

1062
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:05,199
yeah scammers have a list of them and
 

1063
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,789
yeah scammers have a list of them and
they'll just paste in a whole a whole

1064
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:06,799
they'll just paste in a whole a whole
 

1065
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:07,750
they'll just paste in a whole a whole
number

1066
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:07,760
number
 

1067
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,669
number
um so you can look at like the the

1068
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:09,679
um so you can look at like the the
 

1069
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:10,949
um so you can look at like the the
number of milliseconds between

1070
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:10,959
number of milliseconds between
 

1071
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,549
number of milliseconds between
keystrokes like there's all kinds of

1072
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:12,559
keystrokes like there's all kinds of
 

1073
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,150
keystrokes like there's all kinds of
stuff people have come up with you for

1074
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,160
stuff people have come up with you for
 

1075
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,150
stuff people have come up with you for
travel velocity you could probably

1076
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,160
travel velocity you could probably
 

1077
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,069
travel velocity you could probably
incorporate vpns too because there's

1078
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:18,079
incorporate vpns too because there's
 

1079
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,029
incorporate vpns too because there's
probably

1080
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:19,039
probably
 

1081
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:19,909
probably
a

1082
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:19,919
a
 

1083
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,270
a
travel velocity for vpn switching too

1084
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,280
travel velocity for vpn switching too
 

1085
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,189
travel velocity for vpn switching too
that's human-like like if you're using

1086
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:25,199
that's human-like like if you're using
 

1087
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,669
that's human-like like if you're using
legitimately vpn for something else yeah

1088
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:27,679
legitimately vpn for something else yeah
 

1089
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,590
legitimately vpn for something else yeah
um that that might be there's like

1090
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:29,600
um that that might be there's like
 

1091
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,830
um that that might be there's like
legitimate uses too actually you know i

1092
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:31,840
legitimate uses too actually you know i
 

1093
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,590
legitimate uses too actually you know i
feel embarrassed that i don't know this

1094
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:33,600
feel embarrassed that i don't know this
 

1095
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,510
feel embarrassed that i don't know this
probably should but the i'm not a robot

1096
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:37,520
probably should but the i'm not a robot
 

1097
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,070
probably should but the i'm not a robot
capture thing capture thing yeah so that

1098
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
capture thing capture thing yeah so that
 

1099
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,669
capture thing capture thing yeah so that
probably works in the same way like how

1100
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:43,679
probably works in the same way like how
 

1101
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,789
probably works in the same way like how
do you move your mouse maybe or how the

1102
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:46,799
do you move your mouse maybe or how the
 

1103
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,669
do you move your mouse maybe or how the
dynamics of the clicking totally

1104
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:49,679
dynamics of the clicking totally
 

1105
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,270
dynamics of the clicking totally
but how does that even work that well

1106
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:51,280
but how does that even work that well
 

1107
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,190
but how does that even work that well
then and why can't it be fake i need to

1108
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:53,200
then and why can't it be fake i need to
 

1109
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,510
then and why can't it be fake i need to
look into this because it's it's such a

1110
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:55,520
look into this because it's it's such a
 

1111
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,750
look into this because it's it's such a
trivial captcha it feels like should be

1112
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:57,760
trivial captcha it feels like should be
 

1113
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,549
trivial captcha it feels like should be
very crackable and yet a lot of high

1114
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:00,559
very crackable and yet a lot of high
 

1115
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,870
very crackable and yet a lot of high
security places use that yeah it's

1116
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:02,880
security places use that yeah it's
 

1117
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,310
security places use that yeah it's
really interesting it's another cat and

1118
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:04,320
really interesting it's another cat and
 

1119
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,909
really interesting it's another cat and
mouse game so i think they've yeah but

1120
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:05,919
mouse game so i think they've yeah but
 

1121
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,750
mouse game so i think they've yeah but
it's using a lot of similar signals like

1122
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:07,760
it's using a lot of similar signals like
 

1123
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,310
it's using a lot of similar signals like
mouse movements um keystrokes and then

1124
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,320
mouse movements um keystrokes and then
 

1125
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,909
mouse movements um keystrokes and then
obviously all the stuff that comes over

1126
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:11,919
obviously all the stuff that comes over
 

1127
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:12,630
obviously all the stuff that comes over
the

1128
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:12,640
the
 

1129
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,270
the
the wire with your browser so like

1130
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:15,280
the wire with your browser so like
 

1131
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,110
the wire with your browser so like
what operating system what fonts you

1132
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,120
what operating system what fonts you
 

1133
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,870
what operating system what fonts you
know what headers are being sent over

1134
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:18,880
know what headers are being sent over
 

1135
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,029
know what headers are being sent over
and yeah um there's actually there's an

1136
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:21,039
and yeah um there's actually there's an
 

1137
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,789
and yeah um there's actually there's an
old website a camera was called it was

1138
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:22,799
old website a camera was called it was
 

1139
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,150
old website a camera was called it was
kind of like panoptix click or

1140
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:24,160
kind of like panoptix click or
 

1141
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,909
kind of like panoptix click or
panopticon or something but it basically

1142
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:25,919
panopticon or something but it basically
 

1143
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,710
panopticon or something but it basically
was like a proof of concept site that um

1144
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:28,720
was like a proof of concept site that um
 

1145
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,990
was like a proof of concept site that um
they would just show you all the data

1146
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,000
they would just show you all the data
 

1147
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,350
they would just show you all the data
that was kind of getting sent over with

1148
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:31,360
that was kind of getting sent over with
 

1149
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,549
that was kind of getting sent over with
your your request and like

1150
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:34,559
your your request and like
 

1151
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,830
your your request and like
say that there's only one person in the

1152
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:35,840
say that there's only one person in the
 

1153
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,350
say that there's only one person in the
world who has this exact set of data

1154
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:37,360
world who has this exact set of data
 

1155
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,310
world who has this exact set of data
it's you and so it's almost like um

1156
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:40,320
it's you and so it's almost like um
 

1157
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,669
it's you and so it's almost like um
a work around a clever workaround to

1158
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:41,679
a work around a clever workaround to
 

1159
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,029
a work around a clever workaround to
track somebody

1160
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:43,039
track somebody
 

1161
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,669
track somebody
um make identify a unique person even if

1162
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:45,679
um make identify a unique person even if
 

1163
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,510
um make identify a unique person even if
like there wasn't a cookie involved or

1164
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:47,520
like there wasn't a cookie involved or
 

1165
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,510
like there wasn't a cookie involved or
something yeah this is a fascinating

1166
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:49,520
something yeah this is a fascinating
 

1167
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,350
something yeah this is a fascinating
world where you can't see anybody you're

1168
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:51,360
world where you can't see anybody you're
 

1169
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,549
world where you can't see anybody you're
in the dark

1170
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:52,559
in the dark
 

1171
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,070
in the dark
and yet you have a lot of signal you

1172
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,080
and yet you have a lot of signal you
 

1173
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,590
and yet you have a lot of signal you
have to figure out who's the real person

1174
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:55,600
have to figure out who's the real person
 

1175
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,990
have to figure out who's the real person
who's not who's a robot who's not yeah

1176
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,000
who's not who's a robot who's not yeah
 

1177
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,350
who's not who's a robot who's not yeah
uh let me step back we're gonna jump

1178
00:18:59,350 --> 00:18:59,360
uh let me step back we're gonna jump
 

1179
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,950
uh let me step back we're gonna jump
around all over the place step back

1180
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:00,960
around all over the place step back
 

1181
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,070
around all over the place step back
that's why i like your interviews you

1182
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,080
that's why i like your interviews you
 

1183
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,549
that's why i like your interviews you
get into like technical topics

1184
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:04,559
get into like technical topics
 

1185
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,669
get into like technical topics
so so uh just let's use bitcoin as a

1186
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:07,679
so so uh just let's use bitcoin as a
 

1187
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,110
so so uh just let's use bitcoin as a
measure of time

1188
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,120
measure of time
 

1189
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,510
measure of time
you started coinbase when bitcoin was

1190
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:11,520
you started coinbase when bitcoin was
 

1191
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,029
you started coinbase when bitcoin was
ten dollars

1192
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:13,039
ten dollars
 

1193
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,310
ten dollars
yeah um

1194
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,320
yeah um
 

1195
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,909
yeah um
and you just mentioned an incredible

1196
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:15,919
and you just mentioned an incredible
 

1197
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,669
and you just mentioned an incredible
system with security with transactions

1198
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:19,679
system with security with transactions
 

1199
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,029
system with security with transactions
everything is thought through there's a

1200
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:21,039
everything is thought through there's a
 

1201
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,830
everything is thought through there's a
lot going on but what was version one

1202
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:23,840
lot going on but what was version one
 

1203
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,270
lot going on but what was version one
back in those early days the first

1204
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:25,280
back in those early days the first
 

1205
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,350
back in those early days the first
prototype of coinbase what did that look

1206
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:27,360
prototype of coinbase what did that look
 

1207
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,430
prototype of coinbase what did that look
like yeah like what what did it take to

1208
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:29,440
like yeah like what what did it take to
 

1209
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,950
like yeah like what what did it take to
write it

1210
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:30,960
write it
 

1211
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,950
write it
to think through it

1212
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:32,960
to think through it
 

1213
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,510
to think through it
and and uh make it work enough to at

1214
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:35,520
and and uh make it work enough to at
 

1215
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,270
and and uh make it work enough to at
least make you believe that it's gonna

1216
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:37,280
least make you believe that it's gonna
 

1217
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,390
least make you believe that it's gonna
work

1218
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:38,400
work
 

1219
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,510
work
well i definitely didn't know if it was

1220
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:39,520
well i definitely didn't know if it was

gonna work i mean it was kind of i felt
like i was just

1224
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:43,200
like i was just
 

1225
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,950
like i was just
following my gut so

software engineer there

1230
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,280
software engineer there
 

1231
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,470
software engineer there
project manager i was working on some

1232

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,270
fraud prevention stuff for instance
and um i read the bitcoin white paper in

1236
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:55,280
and um i read the bitcoin white paper in
 

1237
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,669
and um i read the bitcoin white paper in
kind of december of 2010

i started going to some bitcoin meetups
 

1241
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,870
i started going to some bitcoin meetups
in the bay area

1242
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:00,880
in the bay area
 

1243
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,149
in the bay area

met lots of interesting people there
 

1245
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,310
met lots of interesting people there
like crazy people anarchists you know

1246
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:04,320
like crazy people anarchists you know
 

1247
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,230
like crazy people anarchists you know
like really brilliant people all the

1248
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:06,240
like really brilliant people all the
 

1249
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,510
like really brilliant people all the
above and

1250
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:07,520
above and
 

1251
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,350
above and
so i started nights and weekends trying

1252
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:09,360
so i started nights and weekends trying
 

1253
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,350
so i started nights and weekends trying
to hack put together a prototype and my

1254
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:11,360
to hack put together a prototype and my
 

1255
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,590
to hack put together a prototype and my
initial thought was

1256
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:13,600
initial thought was
 

1257
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,669
initial thought was
well you know smtp is a protocol that

1258
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:15,679
well you know smtp is a protocol that
 

1259
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,909
well you know smtp is a protocol that
runs email and

1260
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:17,919
runs email and
 

1261
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,990
runs email and
you know git is is a protocol for

1262
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,000
you know git is is a protocol for
 

1263
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,510
you know git is is a protocol for
version control that and but people made

1264
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:21,520
version control that and but people made
 

1265
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,430
version control that and but people made
like gmail and github they don't most

1266
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:23,440
like gmail and github they don't most
 

1267
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,549
like gmail and github they don't most
people don't want to run their own email

1268
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:24,559
people don't want to run their own email
 

1269
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,870
people don't want to run their own email
server or even their own git server they

1270
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:26,880
server or even their own git server they
 

1271
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,789
server or even their own git server they
just want to like use a hosted thing

1272
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:28,799
just want to like use a hosted thing
 

1273
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,149
just want to like use a hosted thing
that you know will do all the security

1274
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:30,159
that you know will do all the security
 

1275
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,510
that you know will do all the security
and backups for them

1276
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:31,520
and backups for them
 

1277
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,870
and backups for them
so the thought in my head at that time

1278
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:32,880
so the thought in my head at that time
 

1279
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,630
so the thought in my head at that time
was bitcoin's this new protocol there's

1280
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:34,640
was bitcoin's this new protocol there's
 

1281
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,310
was bitcoin's this new protocol there's
probably going to be somebody who makes

1282
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:36,320
probably going to be somebody who makes
 

1283
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,830
probably going to be somebody who makes
a hosted service that does all the

1284
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:37,840
a hosted service that does all the
 

1285
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,430
a hosted service that does all the
security and backups for you makes

1286
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:39,440
security and backups for you makes
 

1287
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,909
security and backups for you makes
bitcoin as a protocol easy to use

happened like all at once and it was so

1722
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:05,440
happened like all at once and it was so
 

1723
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,470
happened like all at once and it was so
first of all

1724
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:06,480
first of all
 

1725
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,710
first of all
you have to remember at this time

you have to remember at this time
 

1727
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,470
you have to remember at this time
we were all very sleep deprived which

1728
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:10,480
we were all very sleep deprived which
 

1729
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,990
we were all very sleep deprived which
kind of exacerbates everything if you

1730
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:12,000
kind of exacerbates everything if you
 

1731
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,909
kind of exacerbates everything if you
look at like the exxon valdez spell

1732
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:13,919
look at like the exxon valdez spell
 

1733
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,669
look at like the exxon valdez spell
spill and all these like natural

often involved
 

1739
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,470
often involved
so because the reason why we're so sleep

1740
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:20,480
so because the reason why we're so sleep
 

1741
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,350
so because the reason why we're so sleep
deprived is not just because we were

1742
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:21,360
deprived is not just because we were
 

1743
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,710
deprived is not just because we were
working so much but

1744
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:22,720
working so much but
 

1745
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,549
working so much but
like the site would go offline in the

1746
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:24,559
like the site would go offline in the
 

1747
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,830
like the site would go offline in the
middle of the night and we'd get i get

1748
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:25,840
middle of the night and we'd get i get
 

1749
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,269
middle of the night and we'd get i get
paged i was like on pager duty so i'd

1750
00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:27,279
paged i was like on pager duty so i'd
 

1751
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,710
paged i was like on pager duty so i'd
get woken up sometimes like two or three

1752
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:28,720
get woken up sometimes like two or three
 

1753
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,070
get woken up sometimes like two or three
times a night like have to try to fix

1754
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,080

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,789
something go back to sleep
so

1758
00:27:32,789 --> 00:27:32,799
so
 

1759
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,870
so
in that environment you can kind of get

1760
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:34,880
in that environment you can kind of get
 

1761

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,470
um but you also can't care so much about
what people think because then you'll

1992
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:18,480
what people think because then you'll
 

1993
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,070

never do anything that's truly authentic

1994

never do anything that's truly authentic
 

1995
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,509
never do anything that's truly authentic
to yourself

1996
00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:21,519
to yourself
 

1997
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,710
to yourself
one other thought on that by the way i

1998
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:22,720
one other thought on that by the way i
 

1999
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,029
one other thought on that by the way i
think it's a really good question

2000
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:25,039
think it's a really good question
 

2001
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,630
think it's a really good question
so i've thought about this a lot like

2002
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:26,640
so i've thought about this a lot like
 

2003
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,509
so i've thought about this a lot like
why

2004
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:27,519
why
 

2005
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,950
why
you know people generally kind of hate

2006
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:28,960
you know people generally kind of hate
 

2007
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,350
you know people generally kind of hate
on zuck and they hate on bill gates and

2008
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:31,360
on zuck and they hate on bill gates and
 

2009
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,110
on zuck and they hate on bill gates and
they hate on um

2010
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:33,120
they hate on um
 

2011
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,110
they hate on um
they don't really hate on elon actually

2012
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:35,120
they don't really hate on elon actually
 

2013
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,389
they don't really hate on elon actually
has a lot of haters too but it's a

2014
00:31:36,389 --> 00:31:36,399
has a lot of haters too but it's a
 

2015
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,630
has a lot of haters too but it's a
different thing this is measured this is

2016
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:38,640
different thing this is measured this is
 

2017
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,110
different thing this is measured this is
measured i was looking at some surveys

2018
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,120
measured i was looking at some surveys
 

2019
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,470
measured i was looking at some surveys
so i think

2020
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:42,480
so i think
 

2021
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,029
so i think
uh zuck is the most so loved and hated

2022
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:45,039
uh zuck is the most so loved and hated
 

2023
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,990
uh zuck is the most so loved and hated
right yeah uh zuckerberg is the most

2024
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:48,000

2027
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,509

hated and then i think it's bill gates
 

2029
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,070
hated and then i think it's bill gates
and elon is down there i think it's like

2030
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:56,080
and elon is down there i think it's like
 

2031
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,750
and elon is down there i think it's like
uh 40 percent

2032
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:57,760
uh 40 percent
 

2033
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,029
uh 40 percent
hey zuck people asked and then elon is

2034
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:01,039

2036
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:03,200
in the double digits but low double
 

2037
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,509
in the double digits but low double
digits and so it's interesting you you

2038
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:05,519
digits and so it's interesting you you
 

2039
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,070
digits and so it's interesting you you
just look at this ask yourself why

2040
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:08,080
just look at this ask yourself why
 

2041
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,310
just look at this ask yourself why
right so i ask myself this sometimes too

2042
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:10,320
right so i ask myself this sometimes too
 

2043
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,430
right so i ask myself this sometimes too
because

2044
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:11,440
because
 

2045
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,470
because
i don't claim to know any of these

2046
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:12,480
i don't claim to know any of these
 

2047
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,389
i don't claim to know any of these
people well but like i've i've met them

2048
00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:14,399
people well but like i've i've met them
 

2049
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,149
people well but like i've i've met them
briefly and i my impression is that

2050
00:32:16,149 --> 00:32:16,159
briefly and i my impression is that
 

2051
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:17,750
briefly and i my impression is that
they're actually all smart people trying

2052
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:17,760
they're actually all smart people trying
 

2053

to do good things in the world so
 

2055
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,950
to do good things in the world so
there's not too much difference there

2056
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:20,960
there's not too much difference there
 

2057
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,350
there's not too much difference there

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,030
do i get up there but you can only see
like three or four steps ahead because

2544
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:51,040
like three or four steps ahead because
 

2545
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,470
like three or four steps ahead because
the fog is so thick

2546

the fog is so thick
 

2547
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,470
the fog is so thick
so you have to just take steps into the

00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:54,480
so you have to just take steps into the
 

2549

so you have to just take steps into the
unknown

unknown
 

2551
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,470
unknown
and

00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:56,480
and
 

2553
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,069
and
when you take three steps another three

2554
00:39:58,069 --> 00:39:58,079
when you take three steps another three

they have sort of a comfort with this
 

2589
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,470
they have sort of a comfort with this
risk tolerance but it's actually not

risk tolerance but it's actually not
 

2591
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,910

00:40:47,109 --> 00:40:47,119
seed round pay yourself a salary
 

2607
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,870
seed round pay yourself a salary
try it for like two years or three years

2608
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:48,880
try it for like two years or three years
 

2609

try it for like two years or three years
if it doesn't work go get another job

2610
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:50,400
if it doesn't work go get another job
 

2611

if it doesn't work go get another job
it's not like you're you weren't paying

2612
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:51,920
it's not like you're you weren't paying
 

2613
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,349
it's not like you're you weren't paying
yourself a salary during that time so i

2614
00:40:53,349 --> 00:40:53,359
yourself a salary during that time so i
 

2615
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,270
yourself a salary during that time so i
think i think people overestimate the

2616
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:55,280
think i think people overestimate the
 

2617
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,870
think i think people overestimate the
risk of doing a startup and they just

2618
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:56,880
risk of doing a startup and they just
 

2619
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,829
risk of doing a startup and they just
never they never start because

2620
00:40:59,829 --> 00:40:59,839
never they never start because
 

2621
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,349
never they never start because

it seems crazy and all your friends
 

2623
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,790
it seems crazy and all your friends
think it's silly like that's sort of the

2624

think it's silly like that's sort of the
 

2625
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,430
think it's silly like that's sort of the
default nature of every big startup idea

2626
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:05,440
default nature of every big startup idea
 

2627
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,349
default nature of every big startup idea
it's just basic fear it's the same kind

2628
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:07,359
it's just basic fear it's the same kind
 

2629
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,750
it's just basic fear it's the same kind
of fear that if you see a if you're a

2630
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:09,760

of fear that if you see a if you're a
guy see a cute girl at a bar it's the

2632
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:11,920
guy see a cute girl at a bar it's the
 

2633
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,069
guy see a cute girl at a bar it's the
fear associated with coming up to her

2634
00:41:14,069 --> 00:41:14,079
fear associated with coming up to her
 

2635
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,990
fear associated with coming up to her
yeah you like her asking her it's like

2636
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:16,000
yeah you like her asking her it's like
 

2637
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,190
yeah you like her asking her it's like
what's the actual risk exactly right um

2638
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:19,200
what's the actual risk exactly right um
 

2639
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,870
what's the actual risk exactly right um
she'll say i'm no thanks i'm not no

2640
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:20,880
she'll say i'm no thanks i'm not no
 

2641
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,270
she'll say i'm no thanks i'm not no
thanks and i i guess the risk is like

2642
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:23,280
thanks and i i guess the risk is like
 

2643
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,910
thanks and i i guess the risk is like
that's going to be mentally difficult

2644
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:25,920
that's going to be mentally difficult
 

2645
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,630
that's going to be mentally difficult
to deal with rejection so just like it's

2646
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:28,640
to deal with rejection so just like it's
 

2647
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,630
to deal with rejection so just like it's
mentally difficult to deal with failure

2648
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:30,640
mentally difficult to deal with failure
 

2649
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,069
mentally difficult to deal with failure
if you if you had a bunch of ideas and

2650
00:41:32,069 --> 00:41:32,079
if you if you had a bunch of ideas and
 

2651
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,829
if you if you had a bunch of ideas and
you were excited about them and you

2652
00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:33,839
you were excited about them and you
 

2653
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,589
you were excited about them and you
implement them and you realize

2654
00:41:35,589 --> 00:41:35,599
implement them and you realize
 

2655
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,710
implement them and you realize
they're not good that could be difficult

2656
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:38,720
they're not good that could be difficult
 

2657
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,710
they're not good that could be difficult
to to keep pushing through that but i

2658
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:40,720
to to keep pushing through that but i
 

2659
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,670
to to keep pushing through that but i
suppose that's life you're supposed to

2660
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:43,680
suppose that's life you're supposed to
 

2661
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,109
suppose that's life you're supposed to
you know perseverance through the

2662
00:41:45,109 --> 00:41:45,119
you know perseverance through the
 

2663
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,910
you know perseverance through the
failures yeah and then the risk is low

2664
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:47,920
failures yeah and then the risk is low
 

2665
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,270
failures yeah and then the risk is low
so that's and then the whole time

2666
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:49,280
so that's and then the whole time
 

2667
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,630
so that's and then the whole time
through the fog up the mountain you're

2668
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:50,640
through the fog up the mountain you're
 

2669
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,710
through the fog up the mountain you're
looking for product market fit yeah

2670
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:52,720
looking for product market fit yeah
 

2671
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,150
looking for product market fit yeah
that's right so you know you have it

2672
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:54,160
that's right so you know you have it
 

2673
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,750
that's right so you know you have it
when the usage of your product keeps

2674
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:55,760
when the usage of your product keeps

2677
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:58,470
growing without any marketing dollars or
anything like that it's just like more

2678
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:58,480
anything like that it's just like more

general belief at the time

3114
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:20,480
general belief at the time
 

3115
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,790
general belief at the time
was in order to discover

3116
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:22,800
was in order to discover
 

3117
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,950
was in order to discover
what it means to

3118
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:24,960
what it means to
 

3119
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,950
what it means to
work smart to be efficient to you have

3120
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:26,960
work smart to be efficient to you have
 

3121
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,349
work smart to be efficient to you have
to work your ass off so you have to

3122
00:48:29,349 --> 00:48:29,359
to work your ass off so you have to
 

3123
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:32,069
to work your ass off so you have to
really fail a lot and failure feels like

3124
00:48:32,069 --> 00:48:32,079
really fail a lot and failure feels like
 

3125
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,270
really fail a lot and failure feels like
hard work

3126
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:33,280
hard work
 

3127
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,230
hard work
and so i was always suspicious of people

3128
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:36,240
and so i was always suspicious of people
 

3129
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,150
and so i was always suspicious of people
that would say work smart i would want

3130
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:38,160
that would say work smart i would want
 

3131
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,790
that would say work smart i would want
to interrogate that question

3132
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:40,800
to interrogate that question
 

3133
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,270
to interrogate that question
um but then i also you know have have

3134
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:43,280
um but then i also you know have have
 

3135
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,109
um but then i also you know have have
learned that there is

3136
00:48:45,109 --> 00:48:45,119
learned that there is
 

3137
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:49,109
learned that there is
people that are just exceptionally um

3138
00:48:49,109 --> 00:48:49,119
people that are just exceptionally um
 

3139
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,190
people that are just exceptionally um
exceptionally efficient

3140
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:51,200
exceptionally efficient
 

3141
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,030
exceptionally efficient
they really do know what it means to

3142
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:53,040

00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:55,520
work smart even at a young age
 

3145
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,750
work smart even at a young age
and so like you can't just disqualify

3146
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:57,760
and so like you can't just disqualify
 

3147
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,150
and so like you can't just disqualify
based on that you have to dig in deeper

3148
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:00,160
based on that you have to dig in deeper
 

3149
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,990
based on that you have to dig in deeper

profound about them
in as brief of a question as possible

3172
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:26,800
in as brief of a question as possible
 

3173
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,390
in as brief of a question as possible
and i you know and then of course

3174
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:28,400
and i you know and then of course
 

3175
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,630
and i you know and then of course
there's basic attention to detail and

3176
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:30,640
there's basic attention to detail and
 

3177
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,390
there's basic attention to detail and
brain teasers and stuff like that

3178
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:32,400
brain teasers and stuff like that
 

3179
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,069
brain teasers and stuff like that
depending on the role programming and so

3180
00:49:34,069 --> 00:49:34,079
depending on the role programming and so
 

3181
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,549
depending on the role programming and so
on to see can they can they solve a

3182
00:49:36,549 --> 00:49:36,559
on to see can they can they solve a
 

3183
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:37,910
on to see can they can they solve a
tricky puzzle

3184
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:37,920
tricky puzzle
 

3185
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,150
tricky puzzle
and do so like one that doesn't require

3186
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:40,160
and do so like one that doesn't require
 

3187
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,109
and do so like one that doesn't require
a lot of effort but requires a certain

3188
00:49:43,109 --> 00:49:43,119
a lot of effort but requires a certain
 

3189
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,470
a lot of effort but requires a certain
um non-linear way of thinking is there

3190
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:46,480
um non-linear way of thinking is there
 

3191
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,990
um non-linear way of thinking is there
is there some

3192
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:48,000
is there some
 

3193
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,670
is there some
i mean maybe you don't want to reveal

3194
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:49,680
i mean maybe you don't want to reveal
 

3195
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,589
i mean maybe you don't want to reveal
but is there some questions

3196
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:51,599
but is there some questions
 

3197
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:53,829
but is there some questions
that you sometimes find yourself leaning

3198
00:49:53,829 --> 00:49:53,839
that you sometimes find yourself leaning
 

3199
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:54,790
that you sometimes find yourself leaning
on

3200
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:54,800
on
 

3201
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,109
on
you said like how did you solve

3202
00:49:57,109 --> 00:49:57,119
you said like how did you solve
 

3203
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,349
you said like how did you solve
a hard problem in your past

3204
00:49:59,349 --> 00:49:59,359
a hard problem in your past
 

3205
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,990
a hard problem in your past
and have them talk through it that's one

3206
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:02,000
and have them talk through it that's one
 

3207
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,990
and have them talk through it that's one
you know we started with brain teasers

3208
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:04,000
you know we started with brain teasers
 

3209
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,990
you know we started with brain teasers
periodically at coinbase and i we got we

3210
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:06,000
periodically at coinbase and i we got we
 

3211
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,589
periodically at coinbase and i we got we
got away from that relatively quickly

3212
00:50:07,589 --> 00:50:07,599
got away from that relatively quickly
 

3213
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:08,870
got away from that relatively quickly
and i think

3214
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:08,880
and i think
 

3215
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,030
and i think
one i it's a tough one because i

3216
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:11,040
one i it's a tough one because i
 

3217
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,470
one i it's a tough one because i
actually think

3218
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:12,480
actually think
 

3219
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,030
actually think
it does show how somebody

3220
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:15,040
it does show how somebody
 

3221
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,630
it does show how somebody
kind of performs under pressure but it's

3222
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:16,640
kind of performs under pressure but it's
 

3223
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,150
kind of performs under pressure but it's
i don't think it's a super reliable

3224
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:18,160
i don't think it's a super reliable
 

3225
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,829
i don't think it's a super reliable
indicator because there's some people

3226
00:50:19,829 --> 00:50:19,839
indicator because there's some people
 

3227
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:21,190
indicator because there's some people
who are really

3228
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:21,200
who are really
 

3229
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,309
who are really
good

3230
00:50:22,309 --> 00:50:22,319
good
 

3231
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:25,109
good
in what the typical work situation but

3232
00:50:25,109 --> 00:50:25,119
in what the typical work situation but
 

3233
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:26,309
in what the typical work situation but
that's not a typical work situation

3234
00:50:26,309 --> 00:50:26,319
that's not a typical work situation
 

3235
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:27,670
that's not a typical work situation
where somebody puts you on the spot like

3236
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:27,680
where somebody puts you on the spot like
 

3237
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,270
where somebody puts you on the spot like
in a live interview and sometimes people

3238
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:29,280
in a live interview and sometimes people
 

3239
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,870
in a live interview and sometimes people
get nervous and they can't think clearly

3240
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:30,880
get nervous and they can't think clearly
 

3241
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,150
get nervous and they can't think clearly
and like they don't have their computer

3242
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:32,160
and like they don't have their computer
 

3243
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,589
and like they don't have their computer
in front of them or whatever they

3244
00:50:33,589 --> 00:50:33,599
in front of them or whatever they
 

3245
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,670
in front of them or whatever they
normally use

3246
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:35,680
normally use
 

3247
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,270
normally use
so

3248
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:37,280
so
 

3249
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,589
so
yeah i i'm a little skeptical now of the

3250
00:50:39,589 --> 00:50:39,599
yeah i i'm a little skeptical now of the
 

3251
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,069
yeah i i'm a little skeptical now of the
of the brain teaser thing um

3252
00:50:42,069 --> 00:50:42,079
of the brain teaser thing um
 

3253
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:43,910
of the brain teaser thing um
there is a whole

3254
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:43,920
there is a whole
 

3255
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:44,790
there is a whole
yeah

3256
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:44,800
yeah
 

3257
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,390
yeah
there is a whole question about like a

3258
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:46,400
there is a whole question about like a
 

3259
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,910
there is a whole question about like a
lot of universities are getting rid of

3260
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:47,920
lot of universities are getting rid of
 

3261
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,589
lot of universities are getting rid of
you know entrance exams so if you're

3262
00:50:49,589 --> 00:50:49,599
you know entrance exams so if you're
 

3263
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:52,549
you know entrance exams so if you're
hiring right out of universities um

3264
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:52,559
hiring right out of universities um
 

3265
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:54,069
hiring right out of universities um
sometimes it's becoming a less reliable

3266
00:50:54,069 --> 00:50:54,079
sometimes it's becoming a less reliable
 

3267
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,910
sometimes it's becoming a less reliable
indicator of like are they in that

3268
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:55,920
indicator of like are they in that
 

3269
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,670
indicator of like are they in that
university and i've heard some companies

3270
00:50:57,670 --> 00:50:57,680
university and i've heard some companies
 

3271
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,630
university and i've heard some companies
we haven't done this yet but i've heard

3272
00:50:58,630 --> 00:50:58,640
we haven't done this yet but i've heard
 

3273
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,670
we haven't done this yet but i've heard
some companies are actually creating

3274
00:50:59,670 --> 00:50:59,680
some companies are actually creating
 

3275
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,390
some companies are actually creating
their own like for college grads like

3276
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:02,400
their own like for college grads like
 

3277
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,950
their own like for college grads like
their own um basically

3278
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:04,960
their own um basically
 

3279
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,790
their own um basically
exams like standardized testing almost

3280
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:06,800
exams like standardized testing almost
 

3281
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,950
exams like standardized testing almost
to get people in the door because the

3282
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:08,960
to get people in the door because the
 

3283
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,470
to get people in the door because the
degree almost like doesn't mean what it

3284
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:10,480
degree almost like doesn't mean what it
 

3285
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,710
degree almost like doesn't mean what it
used to which is the whole topic but

3286
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:12,720
used to which is the whole topic but
 

3287
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,150
used to which is the whole topic but
yeah that's fascinating because um

3288
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:16,160
yeah that's fascinating because um
 

3289
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,069
yeah that's fascinating because um
it's fascinating both for that because

3290
00:51:18,069 --> 00:51:18,079
it's fascinating both for that because
 

3291
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:19,670
it's fascinating both for that because
it's not just about you trying to hire a

3292
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:19,680
it's not just about you trying to hire a
 

3293
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,069
it's not just about you trying to hire a
great team it's also to help them find

3294
00:51:22,069 --> 00:51:22,079
great team it's also to help them find
 

3295
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,990
great team it's also to help them find
the right place to work at yeah

3296
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:24,000
the right place to work at yeah
 

3297
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,230
the right place to work at yeah
just like it's like a two-way street

3298
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:26,240
just like it's like a two-way street
 

3299
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,990
just like it's like a two-way street
um

3300
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:28,000
um
 

3301
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,549
um
all right so once you found the

3302
00:51:30,549 --> 00:51:30,559
all right so once you found the
 

3303
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,430
all right so once you found the
the product market fit

3304
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:33,440
the product market fit
 

3305
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,630
the product market fit
how did coinbase become what it is today

3306
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:38,640

 

3307
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,829

so

3308
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:39,839
so
 

3309
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:41,589
so
let me ask on an engineering question

3310
00:51:41,589 --> 00:51:41,599
let me ask on an engineering question
 

3311
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,670
let me ask on an engineering question
actually sort of

3312
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:43,680
actually sort of
 

3313
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:47,750
actually sort of
uh from the the ruby wallet days

3314
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:47,760
uh from the the ruby wallet days
 

3315
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,190
uh from the the ruby wallet days
what are some of the interesting

3316
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:49,200
what are some of the interesting
 

3317
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,190
what are some of the interesting
challenges there or are they not

3318
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:51,200
challenges there or are they not
 

3319
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,150
challenges there or are they not
engineering just the the things that had

3320
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:54,160
engineering just the the things that had
 

3321
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,390
engineering just the the things that had
to be solved uh what were they

3322
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:56,400
to be solved uh what were they
 

3323
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,750
to be solved uh what were they
engineering

3324
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:57,760
engineering
 

3325
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,829
engineering
regulation

3326
00:51:59,829 --> 00:51:59,839
regulation
 

3327
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:02,150
regulation
um

3328
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:02,160
um

00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:06,069
um
financial hiring lawyers

3330
00:52:06,069 --> 00:52:06,079
financial hiring lawyers
 

3331
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:07,589
financial hiring lawyers
what was it

3332
00:52:07,589 --> 00:52:07,599
what was it
 

3333

3335
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,109
so post product market fit yeah a lot of
it's scaling and you got to build up

3336
00:52:11,109 --> 00:52:11,119
it's scaling and you got to build up
 

3337

i think you need to flip those numbers

3362
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:35,040
i think you need to flip those numbers
 

3363
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,470
i think you need to flip those numbers
like this company's not gonna scale

3364
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:36,480
like this company's not gonna scale
 

3365
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,750
like this company's not gonna scale
you're the ceo you don't need to be

3366
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:37,760
you're the ceo you don't need to be
 

3367
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,190

writing code every day

3368
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:39,200
writing code every day
 

3369
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,309
writing code every day
you're gonna have to transition that

3370
00:52:40,309 --> 00:52:40,319
you're gonna have to transition that
 

3371
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,069
you're gonna have to transition that
stuff like even if people can't all that

3372
00:52:42,069 --> 00:52:42,079
stuff like even if people can't all that
 

3373
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:43,589
stuff like even if people can't all that
stuff's locked in your head so maybe

3374
00:52:43,589 --> 00:52:43,599
stuff's locked in your head so maybe
 

3375
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:44,630
stuff's locked in your head so maybe
they're not gonna do it as well as you

3376
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:44,640
they're not gonna do it as well as you
 

3377
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,390
they're not gonna do it as well as you
for the first six months or something

3378
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:46,400
for the first six months or something
 

3379
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,510
for the first six months or something
but like if you don't start to

3380
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:47,520
but like if you don't start to
 

3381
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,870
but like if you don't start to
transition it you're never gonna build a

3382
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:48,880
transition it you're never gonna build a
 

3383
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,870
transition it you're never gonna build a
real company it's just gonna be

3384
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:50,880
real company it's just gonna be
 

3385
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,470
real company it's just gonna be
you're gonna be the bottleneck

3386
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:52,480
you're gonna be the bottleneck
 

3387
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,790
you're gonna be the bottleneck
so you know like a lot of founders

3388
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:54,800
so you know like a lot of founders
 

3389
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,230
so you know like a lot of founders
that took me a while to like really

3390
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:56,240
that took me a while to like really
 

3391
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,589
that took me a while to like really
internalize that lesson i'd always heard

3392
00:52:57,589 --> 00:52:57,599
internalize that lesson i'd always heard
 

3393
00:52:57,599 --> 00:52:59,589
internalize that lesson i'd always heard
people say that and you know

3394
00:52:59,589 --> 00:52:59,599
people say that and you know
 

3395
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:01,990
people say that and you know
but i still was holding on too much to

3396
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:02,000
but i still was holding on too much to
 

3397
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,589
but i still was holding on too much to
decision making and i probably still am

3398
00:53:03,589 --> 00:53:03,599
decision making and i probably still am
 

3399
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:04,790
decision making and i probably still am
by the way like even to this day at

3400
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:04,800
by the way like even to this day at
 

3401
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,230
by the way like even to this day at
coinbase where

3402
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:06,240
coinbase where
 

3403
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,750
coinbase where
we uh continually have to push down

3404
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:07,760
we uh continually have to push down
 

3405
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,670
we uh continually have to push down
decision making in the org like even

3406
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:09,680
decision making in the org like even
 

3407
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,270
decision making in the org like even
with 5000 people like who are the owners

3408
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:11,280
with 5000 people like who are the owners
 

3409
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,790
with 5000 people like who are the owners
of each of these things and so the

3410
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:12,800
of each of these things and so the
 

3411
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,069
of each of these things and so the
temptation is people to push it up and

3412
00:53:14,069 --> 00:53:14,079
temptation is people to push it up and
 

3413
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,549
temptation is people to push it up and
you become a bottleneck and anyway

3414
00:53:16,549 --> 00:53:16,559
you become a bottleneck and anyway
 

3415
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,549
you become a bottleneck and anyway
um so yeah you want you basically need

3416
00:53:18,549 --> 00:53:18,559
um so yeah you want you basically need
 

3417
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:19,589
um so yeah you want you basically need
to make sure you have enough money where

3418
00:53:19,589 --> 00:53:19,599
to make sure you have enough money where
 

3419
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:21,030
to make sure you have enough money where
you don't die

3420
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:21,040
you don't die
 

3421
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,150
you don't die
if there's in some some kind of a

3422
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:22,160
if there's in some some kind of a
 

3423
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,950
if there's in some some kind of a
downturn or hit break even profitability

3424
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:24,960
downturn or hit break even profitability
 

3425
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,630
downturn or hit break even profitability
we were in a position where we were

3426
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:26,640
we were in a position where we were
 

3427
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:27,829
we were in a position where we were
periodically profitable during up

3428
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:27,839
periodically profitable during up
 

3429
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:29,109
periodically profitable during up
periods but then crypto would go down

3430
00:53:29,109 --> 00:53:29,119
periods but then crypto would go down
 

3431
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:30,950
periods but then crypto would go down
and we were unprofitable and so we had

3432
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:30,960
and we were unprofitable and so we had
 

3433
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,430
and we were unprofitable and so we had
to kind of manage our own psychology and

3434
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:33,440
to kind of manage our own psychology and
 

3435
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,030
to kind of manage our own psychology and
the balance sheet to make sure we didn't

3436
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:35,040
the balance sheet to make sure we didn't
 

3437
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,630
the balance sheet to make sure we didn't
like die in the downturn which a lot of

3438
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:36,640
like die in the downturn which a lot of
 

3439
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,069
like die in the downturn which a lot of
crypto companies did

3440
00:53:38,069 --> 00:53:38,079
crypto companies did
 

3441
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:40,470
crypto companies did
um we had to basically professionalize a

3442
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:40,480
um we had to basically professionalize a
 

3443
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,069
um we had to basically professionalize a
whole bunch of services that had been

3444
00:53:42,069 --> 00:53:42,079
whole bunch of services that had been
 

3445
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:44,069
whole bunch of services that had been
just very quickly thrown together by

3446
00:53:44,069 --> 00:53:44,079
just very quickly thrown together by
 

3447
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:45,829
just very quickly thrown together by
like 20 year olds right

3448
00:53:45,829 --> 00:53:45,839
like 20 year olds right
 

3449
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:47,270
like 20 year olds right
whether that was cyber security it's

3450
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:47,280
whether that was cyber security it's
 

3451
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,109
whether that was cyber security it's
like okay how do you get like a really

3452
00:53:49,109 --> 00:53:49,119
like okay how do you get like a really
 

3453
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:51,030
like okay how do you get like a really
senior experienced cyber security person

3454
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:51,040
senior experienced cyber security person
 

3455
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,309
senior experienced cyber security person
but not someone who's so senior that

3456
00:53:52,309 --> 00:53:52,319
but not someone who's so senior that
 

3457

they can't get their hands dirty and
 

3459
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:55,349
they can't get their hands dirty and
they can come into a company with 25 50

3460
00:53:55,349 --> 00:53:55,359
they can come into a company with 25 50
 

3461

00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,069
very kind of
i think that simplifies things that

3648
00:56:38,069 --> 00:56:38,079
i think that simplifies things that
 

3649
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:39,349
i think that simplifies things that
makes

3650
00:56:39,349 --> 00:56:39,359
makes
 

3651
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:41,270
makes
that makes hiring easier that makes

3652
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:41,280
that makes hiring easier that makes
 

3653
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,349
that makes hiring easier that makes
working a coinbase easier that makes

3654
00:56:43,349 --> 00:56:43,359
working a coinbase easier that makes
 

3655
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:45,510
working a coinbase easier that makes
yeah i mean it's similar sort of elon

3656
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:45,520
yeah i mean it's similar sort of elon
 

3657
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,510
yeah i mean it's similar sort of elon
has the same thing it's pretty clear

3658
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:47,520
has the same thing it's pretty clear
 

3659
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,069
has the same thing it's pretty clear
it's pretty clear what we're here to do

it's pretty clear what we're here to do
yeah so

3662
00:56:51,349 --> 00:56:51,359
yeah so
 

3663
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,750
yeah so
i suppose what's the mission

3664
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:53,760
i suppose what's the mission
 

3665
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,270
i suppose what's the mission
of coinbase

3666
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:55,280
of coinbase
 

3667
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,789
of coinbase

organizations that basically score
 

3703
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:27,270
organizations that basically score
countries by economic freedom and the

3704
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:27,280
countries by economic freedom and the
 

3705
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,789

really cool thing about economic freedom
 

3707
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:30,150
really cool thing about economic freedom
is that

3708
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:30,160
is that
 

3709
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,750
is that
basically it positively correlates with

3710
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:31,760
basically it positively correlates with

basically it positively correlates with
things that we all want in society like

3712
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:34,160
things that we all want in society like
 

3713
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,470
things that we all want in society like
um not only higher growth of the economy

3714
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:36,480
um not only higher growth of the economy
 

3715
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,150
um not only higher growth of the economy
but also things like higher

3716
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:38,160
but also things like higher
 

3717
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,470
but also things like higher
self-reported happiness of citizens

3718
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:40,480
self-reported happiness of citizens
 

3719
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,589
self-reported happiness of citizens
better treatment of the environment

3720
00:57:41,589 --> 00:57:41,599
better treatment of the environment
 

3721
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:42,789
better treatment of the environment
better income for the poorest ten

3722
00:57:42,789 --> 00:57:42,799
better income for the poorest ten
 

3723
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:44,150
better income for the poorest ten
percent of people

3724
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:44,160
percent of people
 

3725
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,670
percent of people
and it negatively correlates with things

3726
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:45,680
and it negatively correlates with things
 

3727
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,750
and it negatively correlates with things
we don't want in society like corruption

3728
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:47,760
we don't want in society like corruption

and bribery and war even and things like
 

3731
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,069
and bribery and war even and things like
that and so it's this pretty pretty

3732
00:57:52,069 --> 00:57:52,079
that and so it's this pretty pretty
 

3733
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:55,349
that and so it's this pretty pretty
crazy provocative idea which is that

3734
00:57:55,349 --> 00:57:55,359
crazy provocative idea which is that
 

3735
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:57,430
crazy provocative idea which is that
if you give people good

3736
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:57,440
if you give people good
 

3737
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,589
if you give people good
property rights and rule of law and

3738
00:57:59,589 --> 00:57:59,599
property rights and rule of law and
 

3739
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:00,950
property rights and rule of law and
allow them to trade

3740
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:00,960
allow them to trade
 

3741
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,710
allow them to trade

3749
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,829
you may have noticed this
growing up in various places you did or

3750
00:58:09,829 --> 00:58:09,839
growing up in various places you did or

aires argentina that went through
 

3755
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,829
aires argentina that went through
hyperinflation and

3756
00:58:13,829 --> 00:58:13,839
hyperinflation and
 

3757
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:15,829
hyperinflation and
there's a certain like pessimism that

3758
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:15,839
there's a certain like pessimism that
 

3759
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:17,349
there's a certain like pessimism that
can creep into

3760
00:58:17,349 --> 00:58:17,359
can creep into
 

3761
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:20,150
can creep into
countries when they don't have

3762
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:20,160
countries when they don't have
 

3763
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,910
countries when they don't have
economic freedom which it's basically

3764
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:21,920
economic freedom which it's basically
 

3765
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,829
economic freedom which it's basically
like everyone has this bit of this vibe

3766
00:58:23,829 --> 00:58:23,839
like everyone has this bit of this vibe
 

3767
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:26,150
like everyone has this bit of this vibe
which is like don't stick your head up

3768
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:26,160
which is like don't stick your head up

which is like don't stick your head up
you know don't try too hard because it

3770
00:58:27,829 --> 00:58:27,839
you know don't try too hard because it
 

3771
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:29,190
you know don't try too hard because it
could all be gone tomorrow like the

3772
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:29,200
could all be gone tomorrow like the
 

3773
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,789
could all be gone tomorrow like the
things that really are valuable in life

3774
00:58:30,789 --> 00:58:30,799
things that really are valuable in life
 

3775
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:31,589
things that really are valuable in life
are just

3776
00:58:31,589 --> 00:58:31,599
are just
 

3777
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:33,270
are just
family and friends and the past was

3778
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:33,280
family and friends and the past was
 

3779
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,270
family and friends and the past was
better than the future will be and

3780
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:35,280
better than the future will be and
 

3781
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,870
better than the future will be and
and so you don't really people don't try

3782
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:36,880
and so you don't really people don't try
 

3783
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,349
and so you don't really people don't try

with just as long as you had a
 

3839
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,549
with just as long as you had a
smartphone and now crypto got invented

00:59:24,549 --> 00:59:24,559
smartphone and now crypto got invented
 

3841
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:26,230
smartphone and now crypto got invented
we could everybody could have economic

3842
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:26,240
we could everybody could have economic
 

3843
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,069
we could everybody could have economic
freedom and it's crypto is kind of

3844
00:59:28,069 --> 00:59:28,079
freedom and it's crypto is kind of
 

3845
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:29,510
freedom and it's crypto is kind of
really well suited for economic freedom

3846
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:29,520
really well suited for economic freedom
 

3847
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,470

it can't be taken away from you you can
even

3862
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:41,040
even
 

3863
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,390
even
you know there's like refugees who need

3864
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:42,400
you know there's like refugees who need
 

3865
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,750
you know there's like refugees who need
to flee and they want to take their

3866
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:43,760

often in the traditional financial
system and so

3872
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:48,240
system and so
 

3873
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,069
system and so

resist that so can you sort of elaborate
 

4005
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,510
resist that so can you sort of elaborate
a little bit further

4006
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:55,520
a little bit further

what are the things that limit economic

4008
01:01:57,349 --> 01:01:57,359

ease that

4014
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:02,160
ease that
 

4015
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,190
ease that
you know

4016
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:03,200
you know
 

4017
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,549
you know
today the world like traditional

4018
01:02:04,549 --> 01:02:04,559
today the world like traditional
 

4019
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:06,069
today the world like traditional
financial system is basically every

4020
01:02:06,069 --> 01:02:06,079
financial system is basically every
 

4021
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,990
financial system is basically every
country of the world for the most part

4022
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:08,000
country of the world for the most part
 

4023
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,069
country of the world for the most part
has their own currency

4024
01:02:10,069 --> 01:02:10,079
has their own currency
 

4025
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:12,549
has their own currency
and so there's a group of people or

4026
01:02:12,549 --> 01:02:12,559
and so there's a group of people or
 

4027
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:13,910
and so there's a group of people or
institutions in each of those countries

4028
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:13,920
institutions in each of those countries
 

4029
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,270
institutions in each of those countries
that's controlling

4030
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:15,280
that's controlling
 

4031
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,270
that's controlling
that economic policy or that money

4032
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:17,280
that economic policy or that money
 

4033
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,470
that economic policy or that money
supply

4034
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:18,480
supply
 

4035
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,589
supply
and

4036
01:02:19,589 --> 01:02:19,599
and
 

4037
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:21,029
and
you know it can be

4038
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:21,039
you know it can be
 

4039
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:23,430
you know it can be
it can be manipulated right so

4040
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:23,440
it can be manipulated right so
 

4041
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,950
it can be manipulated right so
it's not like many of these currencies

4042
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:24,960
it's not like many of these currencies
 

4043
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,710
it's not like many of these currencies
are not linked to gold standard you know

4044
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:26,720
are not linked to gold standard you know
 

4045
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,309
are not linked to gold standard you know
the u.s kind of famously came off that

4046
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:28,319
the u.s kind of famously came off that
 

4047
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:30,470
the u.s kind of famously came off that
in the 1970s for instance but if you

4048
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:30,480
in the 1970s for instance but if you
 

4049
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,990
in the 1970s for instance but if you
read ray dalio and all this stuff like

4050
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:32,000
read ray dalio and all this stuff like
 

4051
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,910
read ray dalio and all this stuff like
he talks about there's thousands of fiat

4052
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:33,920
he talks about there's thousands of fiat
 

4053
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,349
he talks about there's thousands of fiat
currencies that have been in existence

4054
01:02:35,349 --> 01:02:35,359
currencies that have been in existence
 

4055
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:36,549
currencies that have been in existence
over time

4056
01:02:36,549 --> 01:02:36,559
over time
 

4057
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:37,589
over time
and

4058
01:02:37,589 --> 01:02:37,599
and
 

4059
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:38,950
and
basically all of them eventually get

4060
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:38,960
basically all of them eventually get
 

4061
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,910
basically all of them eventually get
disconnected from um backing of like

4062
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:41,920
disconnected from um backing of like
 

4063
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,510
disconnected from um backing of like
hard commodities

4064
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:43,520
hard commodities
 

4065
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,829
hard commodities
and then they get over inflated and

4066
01:02:45,829 --> 01:02:45,839
and then they get over inflated and
 

4067
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:47,190
and then they get over inflated and
printed and so

4068
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:47,200
printed and so
 

4069
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,270
printed and so
in times of stress

4070
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:49,280
in times of stress
 

4071
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,430
in times of stress
um you know with nixon i guess it was

4072
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:51,440
um you know with nixon i guess it was
 

4073
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,589
um you know with nixon i guess it was
like in the u.s it was the vietnam war

4074
01:02:53,589 --> 01:02:53,599
like in the u.s it was the vietnam war
 

4075
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:55,510
like in the u.s it was the vietnam war
or something like that it kind of drove

4076
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:55,520
or something like that it kind of drove
 

4077
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,029
or something like that it kind of drove
government spending and so under times

4078
01:02:57,029 --> 01:02:57,039
government spending and so under times
 

4079
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:58,549
government spending and so under times
of stress they say hey it's a temporary

4080
01:02:58,549 --> 01:02:58,559
of stress they say hey it's a temporary
 

4081
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,630
of stress they say hey it's a temporary
measure we need to break the peg um

4082
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:00,640
measure we need to break the peg um
 

4083
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,309
measure we need to break the peg um
temporary was like you know famous words

4084
01:03:02,309 --> 01:03:02,319
temporary was like you know famous words
 

4085
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:04,950
temporary was like you know famous words
that he used and um

4086
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:04,960
that he used and um
 

4087
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,349
that he used and um
and they go they go like they go print

4088
01:03:07,349 --> 01:03:07,359
and they go they go like they go print
 

4089
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:08,870
and they go they go like they go print
and so the bad thing about that of

4090
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:08,880
and so the bad thing about that of
 

4091
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,470
and so the bad thing about that of
course is that it sort of erodes

4092
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:10,480
course is that it sort of erodes
 

4093
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,390
course is that it sort of erodes
people's like wealth if they can only

4094
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:12,400
people's like wealth if they can only
 

4095
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,589
people's like wealth if they can only
hold their assets in cash which

4096
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:13,599
hold their assets in cash which
 

4097
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:15,589
hold their assets in cash which
basically like poor people tend to do

4098
01:03:15,589 --> 01:03:15,599
basically like poor people tend to do
 

4099
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:16,390
basically like poor people tend to do
that

4100
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:16,400
that
 

4101
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,230
that
you know if you're wealthy you can hold

4102
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:18,240
you know if you're wealthy you can hold
 

4103
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,390
you know if you're wealthy you can hold
um stocks or like real estate and things

4104
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:20,400
um stocks or like real estate and things
 

4105
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,829
um stocks or like real estate and things
like that but so it's a really attacks

4106
01:03:21,829 --> 01:03:21,839
like that but so it's a really attacks
 

4107
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,589
like that but so it's a really attacks
on the poorest people in society

4108
01:03:23,589 --> 01:03:23,599
on the poorest people in society
 

4109
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:27,349
on the poorest people in society
inflation so anyway crypto in in a way

4110
01:03:27,349 --> 01:03:27,359
inflation so anyway crypto in in a way
 

4111
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:29,430
inflation so anyway crypto in in a way
is a little bit of like um a return to

4112
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:29,440
is a little bit of like um a return to
 

4113
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,190
is a little bit of like um a return to
the gold standard in this digital era

4114
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:31,200
the gold standard in this digital era
 

4115
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,870
the gold standard in this digital era
right bitcoin there's guaranteed

4116
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:32,880
right bitcoin there's guaranteed
 

4117
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,950
right bitcoin there's guaranteed
scarcity of it it's deflationary there's

4118
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:34,960
scarcity of it it's deflationary there's
 

4119
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,230
scarcity of it it's deflationary there's
never going to be more than 21 million

4120
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:36,240
never going to be more than 21 million
 

4121
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,270
never going to be more than 21 million
bitcoin

4122
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:37,280
bitcoin
 

4123
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,510
bitcoin
and so that's that's a really

4124
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:39,520
and so that's that's a really
 

4125
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,109
and so that's that's a really
important principle

4126
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:41,119
important principle
 

4127

you would have to go to all 200
countries in the world sometimes like

um
 

4245
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:22,470
um
yeah and in some ways it is um

4246
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:22,480
yeah and in some ways it is um
 

4247
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,549
yeah and in some ways it is um
it's a it's a clever it's a clever way

that's
 

4251
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,430
that's
not yeah it's it's enabling people to do

4252
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:27,440
not yeah it's it's enabling people to do
 

4253
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,670
not yeah it's it's enabling people to do
that in a novel way so is unit swap in

4254
01:05:29,670 --> 01:05:29,680
that in a novel way so is unit swap in
 

4255
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,150
that in a novel way so is unit swap in
some sense a competitor coinbase in

4256
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:32,160
some sense a competitor coinbase in
 

4257
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,549
some sense a competitor coinbase in
which way is it and which way is it not

4258
01:05:34,549 --> 01:05:34,559
which way is it and which way is it not
 

4259
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:36,470
which way is it and which way is it not
so because

4260
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:36,480
so because
 

4261
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,150
so because
for people who don't know

4262
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:38,160
for people who don't know
 

4263
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,470
for people who don't know
coinbase is centralized

4264
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:40,480
coinbase is centralized
 

4265
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,470
coinbase is centralized
so let me ask uh

4266
01:05:42,470 --> 01:05:42,480
so let me ask uh
 

4267
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,870
so let me ask uh
doesn't that go against the spirit of

4268
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:44,880
doesn't that go against the spirit of
 

4269
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,870
doesn't that go against the spirit of
crypto since kryptos is is decentralized

4270
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:48,880
crypto since kryptos is is decentralized
 

4271
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,470

what are the pros and cons of being

4272
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:50,480
what are the pros and cons of being
 

4273
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,750
what are the pros and cons of being
centralized as an exchange

centralized as an exchange
 

4275
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:54,950
centralized as an exchange
so i don't think coinbase is fully

4276
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:54,960
so i don't think coinbase is fully
 

4277
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,470
so i don't think coinbase is fully
centralized there we have many different

4278
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:56,480
centralized there we have many different
 

4279
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,150
centralized there we have many different
products and the way that i think about

4280
01:05:58,150 --> 01:05:58,160
products and the way that i think about
 

4281
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,510
products and the way that i think about
it is that

4282
01:05:59,510 --> 01:05:59,520
it is that
 

4283
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:00,870
it is that
our exchange

4284
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:00,880

centralized regulated financial service
 

4289
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:07,029
centralized regulated financial service
business and it's actually important for

4290
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:07,039
business and it's actually important for
 

4291
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:08,549
business and it's actually important for
the crypto ecosystem to have that

4292
01:06:08,549 --> 01:06:08,559
the crypto ecosystem to have that
 

4293
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:10,069
the crypto ecosystem to have that
because you want to

4294
01:06:10,069 --> 01:06:10,079
because you want to
 

4295
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:11,430
because you want to
allow a lot of the fiat money in the

4296
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:11,440
allow a lot of the fiat money in the
 

4297
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,349
allow a lot of the fiat money in the
world to flow into the crypto economy so

4298
01:06:13,349 --> 01:06:13,359
world to flow into the crypto economy so
 

4299
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:14,150
world to flow into the crypto economy so
we

4300
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:14,160
we
 

4301
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,990
we
you know we're very proud of that and i

4302
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:16,000
you know we're very proud of that and i
 

4303
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,270
you know we're very proud of that and i
think we've helped a lot of that money

4304
01:06:17,270 --> 01:06:17,280
think we've helped a lot of that money
 

4305
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,390
think we've helped a lot of that money
flow in

4306
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:18,400
flow in
 

4307
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,390
flow in
now once people have money in crypto

4308
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:20,400
now once people have money in crypto
 

4309
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,750
now once people have money in crypto
they can choose to hold it in a variety

4310
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:21,760
they can choose to hold it in a variety
 

4311
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,109
they can choose to hold it in a variety
of ways and they can choose to hold it

4312
01:06:23,109 --> 01:06:23,119
of ways and they can choose to hold it
 

4313
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:24,870
of ways and they can choose to hold it
in a self-custodial wallet which is more

4314
01:06:24,870 --> 01:06:24,880
in a self-custodial wallet which is more
 

4315
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,829
in a self-custodial wallet which is more
decentralized they can choose to use

4316
01:06:27,829 --> 01:06:27,839
decentralized they can choose to use
 

4317
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:30,390
decentralized they can choose to use
decentralized exchanges which

4318
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:30,400
decentralized exchanges which
 

4319
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,789
decentralized exchanges which
we we love and uniswap is not really i

4320
01:06:32,789 --> 01:06:32,799
we we love and uniswap is not really i
 

4321
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:34,069
we we love and uniswap is not really i
don't think of them as like a direct

4322
01:06:34,069 --> 01:06:34,079
don't think of them as like a direct
 

4323
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:35,829
don't think of them as like a direct
competitor to us we we basically have

4324
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:35,839
competitor to us we we basically have
 

4325
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:37,750
competitor to us we we basically have
integrated um unit swap into a number of

4326
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:37,760
integrated um unit swap into a number of
 

4327
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,510
integrated um unit swap into a number of
our products we we love d5 decentralized

4328
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:39,520
our products we we love d5 decentralized
 

4329
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,270
our products we we love d5 decentralized
exchanges all the whole thing

4330
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:41,280
exchanges all the whole thing
 

4331
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,150
exchanges all the whole thing
so

4332
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:42,160
so
 

4333
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,230
so
any coinbase wallet which is a

4334
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:44,240
any coinbase wallet which is a
 

4335
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,630
any coinbase wallet which is a
self-custodial wallet is more

4336
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:46,640
self-custodial wallet is more
 

4337
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,670
self-custodial wallet is more
decentralized and it allows people to

4338
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:49,680
decentralized and it allows people to
 

4339
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,670
decentralized and it allows people to
um hold their own crypto they don't have

4340
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:51,680
um hold their own crypto they don't have
 

4341
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,270
um hold their own crypto they don't have
to trust us can you explain what a

4342
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:53,280
to trust us can you explain what a
 

4343
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,150
to trust us can you explain what a
self-custodial wallet is what is the

4344
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:56,160
self-custodial wallet is what is the
 

4345
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,990
self-custodial wallet is what is the
wallet and what is the self-custodial

4346
01:06:57,990 --> 01:06:58,000
wallet and what is the self-custodial
 

4347
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,750
wallet and what is the self-custodial
wallet yeah so it's confusing so um so a

4348
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:01,760
wallet yeah so it's confusing so um so a
 

4349
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,670
wallet yeah so it's confusing so um so a
custodial wallet means you're trusting

4350
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:03,680
custodial wallet means you're trusting
 

4351
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,270
custodial wallet means you're trusting
coinbase to store

4352
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:05,280
coinbase to store
 

4353
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,309
coinbase to store
your crypto the private keys themselves

4354
01:07:08,309 --> 01:07:08,319
your crypto the private keys themselves
 

4355
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:09,829
your crypto the private keys themselves
and you know for some people in

4356
01:07:09,829 --> 01:07:09,839
and you know for some people in
 

4357
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:11,750
and you know for some people in
institutions and everything just meeting

4358
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:11,760
institutions and everything just meeting
 

4359
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,349
institutions and everything just meeting
them where they are today that's nice

4360
01:07:13,349 --> 01:07:13,359
them where they are today that's nice
 

4361
01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:16,230
them where they are today that's nice
because it's simpler you know

4362
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:16,240
because it's simpler you know
 

4363
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,150
because it's simpler you know
um they're not afraid of losing their

4364
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:18,160
um they're not afraid of losing their
 

4365
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:19,589
um they're not afraid of losing their
crypto if they make some accident

4366
01:07:19,589 --> 01:07:19,599
crypto if they make some accident
 

4367
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:22,150
crypto if they make some accident
accidental mistake or so you know a

4368
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:22,160
accidental mistake or so you know a
 

4369
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:23,270
accidental mistake or so you know a
custodial

4370
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:23,280
custodial
 

4371
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,190
custodial
um crypto products are important to help

4372
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:25,200
um crypto products are important to help
 

4373
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,349
um crypto products are important to help
get a bunch of people into the ecosystem

4374
01:07:27,349 --> 01:07:27,359
get a bunch of people into the ecosystem
 

4375
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,470
get a bunch of people into the ecosystem
but

4376
01:07:28,470 --> 01:07:28,480
but
 

4377
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,069
but
i'm very supportive of self-custodial

4378
01:07:30,069 --> 01:07:30,079
i'm very supportive of self-custodial
 

4379
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,750
i'm very supportive of self-custodial
wallets and i think in some ways they

4380
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:31,760
wallets and i think in some ways they
 

4381
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,589
wallets and i think in some ways they
are the future because more and more

4382
01:07:33,589 --> 01:07:33,599
are the future because more and more
 

4383
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:34,630
are the future because more and more
people are going to want to store their

4384
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:34,640
people are going to want to store their
 

4385
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,390
people are going to want to store their
own crypto not trust a third-party

4386
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:36,400
own crypto not trust a third-party
 

4387
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,910
own crypto not trust a third-party
institution do it and in some ways that

4388
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:37,920
institution do it and in some ways that
 

4389
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,670
institution do it and in some ways that
is much more authentic to the ethos of

4390
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:39,680
is much more authentic to the ethos of
 

4391
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:40,870
is much more authentic to the ethos of
crypto so

4392
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:40,880
crypto so
 

4393
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,870
crypto so
coinbase will help you convert the fiat

4394
01:07:42,870 --> 01:07:42,880
coinbase will help you convert the fiat
 

4395
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,470
coinbase will help you convert the fiat
into crypto in a

4396
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:44,480
into crypto in a
 

4397
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:45,829
into crypto in a
frankly that's a more centralized thing

4398
01:07:45,829 --> 01:07:45,839
frankly that's a more centralized thing
 

4399
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:47,589
frankly that's a more centralized thing
but once you have crypto you can then go

4400
01:07:47,589 --> 01:07:47,599
but once you have crypto you can then go
 

4401
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:49,270
but once you have crypto you can then go
to the self custodial world store it

4402
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:49,280
to the self custodial world store it
 

4403
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,349
to the self custodial world store it
yourself in in a to get into the

4404
01:07:51,349 --> 01:07:51,359
yourself in in a to get into the
 

4405
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,349
yourself in in a to get into the
technical details just for a second

4406
01:07:53,349 --> 01:07:53,359
technical details just for a second
 

4407
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:55,430
technical details just for a second
it's basically saying um

4408
01:07:55,430 --> 01:07:55,440
it's basically saying um
 

4409
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:56,630
it's basically saying um
you're going to store the keys on your

4410
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:56,640
you're going to store the keys on your
 

4411
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:57,829
you're going to store the keys on your
own device

4412
01:07:57,829 --> 01:07:57,839
own device
 

4413
01:07:57,839 --> 01:08:01,029
own device
and so um even if coinbase you know

4414
01:08:01,029 --> 01:08:01,039
and so um even if coinbase you know
 

4415
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:02,950
and so um even if coinbase you know
gets some court order to seize it we

4416
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:02,960
gets some court order to seize it we
 

4417
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,470
gets some court order to seize it we
actually can't like from an architecture

4418
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:04,480
actually can't like from an architecture
 

4419
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,950
actually can't like from an architecture
point of view we can't do it um or you

4420
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:06,960
point of view we can't do it um or you
 

4421
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,069
point of view we can't do it um or you
know if coinbase gets hacked or

4422
01:08:08,069 --> 01:08:08,079
know if coinbase gets hacked or
 

4423
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:09,750
know if coinbase gets hacked or
something we can't lose your funds like

4424
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:09,760
something we can't lose your funds like
 

4425
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,430
something we can't lose your funds like
now you the thing is you have to take

4426
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:11,440
now you the thing is you have to take
 

4427
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:12,630
now you the thing is you have to take
the responsibility because we're not

4428
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:12,640
the responsibility because we're not
 

4429
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:15,029
the responsibility because we're not
taking it so the individual person could

4430
01:08:15,029 --> 01:08:15,039
taking it so the individual person could
 

4431
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:16,709
taking it so the individual person could
get hacked right and

4432
01:08:16,709 --> 01:08:16,719
get hacked right and
 

4433
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:18,070
get hacked right and
there's a whole bunch of really cool

4434
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:18,080
there's a whole bunch of really cool
 

4435
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:19,349
there's a whole bunch of really cool
research happening to make self

4436
01:08:19,349 --> 01:08:19,359
research happening to make self
 

4437
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:20,870
research happening to make self
custodial wallets

4438
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:20,880
custodial wallets
 

4439
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,669
custodial wallets
more resilient to accidental loss

4440
01:08:23,669 --> 01:08:23,679
more resilient to accidental loss
 

4441
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:26,550
more resilient to accidental loss
hacks and just user error like

4442
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:26,560
hacks and just user error like
 

4443
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:27,430
hacks and just user error like
you know

4444
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:27,440
you know
 

4445
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:28,630
you know
they're i don't know how much you've

4446
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:28,640
they're i don't know how much you've
 

4447
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:29,990
they're i don't know how much you've
looked at like various cryptography

4448
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:30,000
looked at like various cryptography
 

4449
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,229
looked at like various cryptography
things but there's like basically um you

4450
01:08:32,229 --> 01:08:32,239
things but there's like basically um you
 

4451
01:08:32,239 --> 01:08:34,789
things but there's like basically um you
can have multiple key multi-sig

4452
01:08:34,789 --> 01:08:34,799
can have multiple key multi-sig
 

4453
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:36,309
can have multiple key multi-sig
multiple signatures from different keys

4454
01:08:36,309 --> 01:08:36,319
multiple signatures from different keys
 

4455
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:37,829
multiple signatures from different keys
on different devices where you need like

4456
01:08:37,829 --> 01:08:37,839
on different devices where you need like
 

4457
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:39,590
on different devices where you need like
two of the three or three of the five

4458
01:08:39,590 --> 01:08:39,600
two of the three or three of the five
 

4459
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,829
two of the three or three of the five
there's a whole um technology called

4460
01:08:41,829 --> 01:08:41,839
there's a whole um technology called
 

4461
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:43,669
there's a whole um technology called
multi-party computation or threshold

4462
01:08:43,669 --> 01:08:43,679
multi-party computation or threshold
 

4463
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:45,669
multi-party computation or threshold
signing signatures which is really cool

4464
01:08:45,669 --> 01:08:45,679
signing signatures which is really cool
 

4465
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:47,349
signing signatures which is really cool
um but those are the things you would

4466
01:08:47,349 --> 01:08:47,359
um but those are the things you would
 

4467
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:48,950
um but those are the things you would
run locally

4468
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:48,960
run locally
 

4469
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,950
run locally
like these are all security measures

4470
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:50,960
like these are all security measures
 

4471
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,950
like these are all security measures
like cryptography measures to protect

4472
01:08:52,950 --> 01:08:52,960
like cryptography measures to protect
 

4473
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:53,749
like cryptography measures to protect
you

4474
01:08:53,749 --> 01:08:53,759
you
 

4475
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:56,550
you
without a centralized component

4476
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:56,560
without a centralized component
 

4477
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,789
without a centralized component
right so like a simple example would be

4478
01:08:58,789 --> 01:08:58,799
right so like a simple example would be
 

4479
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:00,870
right so like a simple example would be
let's say you had a two of three

4480
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:00,880
let's say you had a two of three
 

4481
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,110
let's say you had a two of three
key signature and

4482
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:03,120
key signature and
 

4483
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,309
key signature and
you know one key might be sort of

4484
01:09:04,309 --> 01:09:04,319
you know one key might be sort of
 

4485
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:06,309
you know one key might be sort of
coinbase but that's not a quorum so we

4486
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:06,319
coinbase but that's not a quorum so we
 

4487
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:07,990
coinbase but that's not a quorum so we
couldn't unilaterally move your funds

4488
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:08,000
couldn't unilaterally move your funds
 

4489
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,669
couldn't unilaterally move your funds
but another key is on your device on

4490
01:09:09,669 --> 01:09:09,679
but another key is on your device on
 

4491
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:11,990
but another key is on your device on
your phone let's say oh cool um so that

4492
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:12,000
your phone let's say oh cool um so that
 

4493
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,229
your phone let's say oh cool um so that
so in a normal situation you have a key

4494
01:09:14,229 --> 01:09:14,239
so in a normal situation you have a key
 

4495
01:09:14,239 --> 01:09:15,990
so in a normal situation you have a key
on your phone we have one

4496
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:16,000
on your phone we have one
 

4497
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,709
on your phone we have one
um but you and so two out of three now

4498
01:09:18,709 --> 01:09:18,719
um but you and so two out of three now
 

4499
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,550
um but you and so two out of three now
just you know it can all get signed very

4500
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:20,560
just you know it can all get signed very
 

4501
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,229
just you know it can all get signed very
quickly for day-to-day use but let's say

4502
01:09:22,229 --> 01:09:22,239
quickly for day-to-day use but let's say
 

4503
01:09:22,239 --> 01:09:23,829
quickly for day-to-day use but let's say
you lose your phone or something

4504
01:09:23,829 --> 01:09:23,839
you lose your phone or something
 

4505
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,590
you lose your phone or something
now there has to be a third key and

4506
01:09:25,590 --> 01:09:25,600
now there has to be a third key and
 

4507
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,269
now there has to be a third key and
that's where you know you could store it

4508
01:09:27,269 --> 01:09:27,279
that's where you know you could store it
 

4509
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:30,309
that's where you know you could store it
in a backup somewhere um like in google

4510
01:09:30,309 --> 01:09:30,319
in a backup somewhere um like in google
 

4511
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:33,590
in a backup somewhere um like in google
drive or icloud you could trust a third

4512
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:33,600
drive or icloud you could trust a third
 

4513
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,430
drive or icloud you could trust a third
party that's not coinbase to also have

4514
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:35,440
party that's not coinbase to also have
 

4515
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,349
party that's not coinbase to also have
that one key and they can't do anything

4516
01:09:37,349 --> 01:09:37,359
that one key and they can't do anything
 

4517
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:39,829
that one key and they can't do anything
unilaterally with that one key so that's

4518
01:09:39,829 --> 01:09:39,839
unilaterally with that one key so that's
 

4519
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:41,269
unilaterally with that one key so that's
a simple example you can get you can get

4520
01:09:41,269 --> 01:09:41,279
a simple example you can get you can get
 

4521
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:42,550
a simple example you can get you can get
way more complicated yeah that's an

4522
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:42,560
way more complicated yeah that's an
 

4523
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,470
way more complicated yeah that's an
awesome idea and so like yeah if your

4524
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:44,480
awesome idea and so like yeah if your
 

4525
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,309
awesome idea and so like yeah if your
funds get seized

4526
01:09:46,309 --> 01:09:46,319
funds get seized
 

4527
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:49,430
funds get seized
coinbase can't can't do anything right

4528
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:49,440
coinbase can't can't do anything right
 

4529
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,110
coinbase can't can't do anything right
uh but you better not lose your phone

4530
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:51,120
uh but you better not lose your phone
 

4531
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,950
uh but you better not lose your phone
maybe in that case yeah

4532
01:09:52,950 --> 01:09:52,960
maybe in that case yeah
 

4533
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,310
maybe in that case yeah
so yeah that's

4534
01:09:54,310 --> 01:09:54,320
so yeah that's
 

4535
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,990
so yeah that's
but it provides a there is so even if

4536
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:56,000
but it provides a there is so even if
 

4537
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:56,950
but it provides a there is so even if
you lose your phone then there is a

4538
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:56,960
you lose your phone then there is a
 

4539
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,070
you lose your phone then there is a
recovery mechanism because you can get

4540
01:09:58,070 --> 01:09:58,080
recovery mechanism because you can get
 

4541
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,510
recovery mechanism because you can get
the one key from coinbase the one from

4542
01:09:59,510 --> 01:09:59,520
the one key from coinbase the one from
 

4543
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,350
the one key from coinbase the one from
your backup provider

4544
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:01,360
your backup provider
 

4545
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,630
your backup provider
and recover

4546
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:02,640
and recover
 

4547
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,390
and recover
a new one back on your phone i know yeah

4548
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:04,400
a new one back on your phone i know yeah
 

4549
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,709
a new one back on your phone i know yeah
but but what if coinbase is no longer

4550
01:10:06,709 --> 01:10:06,719
but but what if coinbase is no longer
 

4551
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:08,630
but but what if coinbase is no longer
but because of government because of

4552
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:08,640
but because of government because of
 

4553
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,950
but because of government because of
what say it's in north korea

4554
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:10,960
what say it's in north korea
 

4555
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,709
what say it's in north korea
government says you're no longer like

4556
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:12,719
government says you're no longer like
 

4557
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:14,709
government says you're no longer like
coinbase is shut down in that country or

4558
01:10:14,709 --> 01:10:14,719
coinbase is shut down in that country or
 

4559
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:16,310
coinbase is shut down in that country or
something like that right then you can

4560
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:16,320
something like that right then you can
 

4561
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:18,310
something like that right then you can
get it even if you have access to those

4562
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:18,320
get it even if you have access to those
 

4563
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:19,430
get it even if you have access to those
too right

4564
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:19,440
too right
 

4565
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,830
too right
so uh again

4566
01:10:21,830 --> 01:10:21,840
so uh again
 

4567
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,669
so uh again
perhaps a silly question but isn't a

4568
01:10:23,669 --> 01:10:23,679
perhaps a silly question but isn't a
 

4569
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:25,669
perhaps a silly question but isn't a
self-custodial wallet

4570
01:10:25,669 --> 01:10:25,679
self-custodial wallet
 

4571
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:27,990
self-custodial wallet
a competitor as a notion

4572
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:28,000
a competitor as a notion
 

4573
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,669
a competitor as a notion
to coinbase

4574
01:10:29,669 --> 01:10:29,679
to coinbase
 

4575
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:31,750
to coinbase
no i mean we so we offer

4576
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:31,760
no i mean we so we offer
 

4577
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,669
no i mean we so we offer
a self custodial wallet um we've built

4578
01:10:33,669 --> 01:10:33,679
a self custodial wallet um we've built
 

4579
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:35,669
a self custodial wallet um we've built
one and it's like but doesn't it bleed

4580
01:10:35,669 --> 01:10:35,679
one and it's like but doesn't it bleed
 

4581
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:37,830
one and it's like but doesn't it bleed
the like i guess i'm asking a sort of a

4582
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:37,840
the like i guess i'm asking a sort of a
 

4583
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,510
the like i guess i'm asking a sort of a
financial question

4584
01:10:39,510 --> 01:10:39,520
financial question
 

4585
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,470
financial question
is uh like how does coinbase make money

4586
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:42,480
is uh like how does coinbase make money
 

4587
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:45,350
is uh like how does coinbase make money
on transactions so does this not does it

4588
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:45,360
on transactions so does this not does it
 

4589
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,510
on transactions so does this not does it
does not decrease the number or does not

4590
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:47,520
does not decrease the number or does not
 

4591
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,830
does not decrease the number or does not
significantly negatively affect

4592
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:49,840
significantly negatively affect
 

4593
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,830
significantly negatively affect
transactions or are you more focused on

4594
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:51,840
transactions or are you more focused on
 

4595
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,070
transactions or are you more focused on
growing the number of the pie of the

4596
01:10:54,070 --> 01:10:54,080
growing the number of the pie of the
 

4597
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:55,350
growing the number of the pie of the
number of people that are using

4598
01:10:55,350 --> 01:10:55,360
number of people that are using
 

4599
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,430
number of people that are using
cryptocurrency yeah like a traditional

4600
01:10:57,430 --> 01:10:57,440
cryptocurrency yeah like a traditional
 

4601
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,110
cryptocurrency yeah like a traditional
financial service firm would probably

4602
01:10:59,110 --> 01:10:59,120
financial service firm would probably
 

4603
01:10:59,120 --> 01:10:59,990
financial service firm would probably
say

4604
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:00,000
say
 

4605
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,070
say
well we should be storing let's keep

4606
01:11:02,070 --> 01:11:02,080
well we should be storing let's keep
 

4607
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,830
well we should be storing let's keep
more of the custody with us because

4608
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:03,840
more of the custody with us because
 

4609
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,669
more of the custody with us because
that's how we prove to the world that

4610
01:11:05,669 --> 01:11:05,679
that's how we prove to the world that
 

4611
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:07,350
that's how we prove to the world that
we're valuable or whatever

4612
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:07,360
we're valuable or whatever
 

4613
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,110
we're valuable or whatever
i don't really believe that like i think

4614
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:09,120
i don't really believe that like i think
 

4615
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:10,470
i don't really believe that like i think
that actually we kind of want to

4616
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:10,480
that actually we kind of want to
 

4617
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:11,750
that actually we kind of want to
encourage our users to move to

4618
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:11,760
encourage our users to move to
 

4619
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,510
encourage our users to move to
self-custody over time for those who are

4620
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:13,520
self-custody over time for those who are
 

4621
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,870
self-custody over time for those who are
ready and willing

4622
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:14,880
ready and willing
 

4623
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,630
ready and willing
and that technology needs to mature i'm

4624
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:16,640
and that technology needs to mature i'm
 

4625
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:17,990
and that technology needs to mature i'm
not trying to like force anybody to do

4626
01:11:17,990 --> 01:11:18,000
not trying to like force anybody to do
 

4627
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,910
not trying to like force anybody to do
it who doesn't want to do it but

4628
01:11:19,910 --> 01:11:19,920
it who doesn't want to do it but
 

4629
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,590
it who doesn't want to do it but
to me that's like the future of how we

4630
01:11:21,590 --> 01:11:21,600
to me that's like the future of how we
 

4631
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,830
to me that's like the future of how we
get billions of people using crypto but

4632
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:23,840
get billions of people using crypto but
 

4633
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,189
get billions of people using crypto but
doesn't that mean they can go somewhere

4634
01:11:25,189 --> 01:11:25,199
doesn't that mean they can go somewhere
 

4635
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:26,550
doesn't that mean they can go somewhere
else

4636
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:26,560
else
 

4637
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:29,030
else
easier yeah that's sort of the point is

4638
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:29,040
easier yeah that's sort of the point is
 

4639
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,870
easier yeah that's sort of the point is
like we're all using the same protocol

4640
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:30,880
like we're all using the same protocol
 

4641
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,390
like we're all using the same protocol
so there's low switching costs which

4642
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:32,400
so there's low switching costs which
 

4643
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,750
so there's low switching costs which
keeps all the companies accountable

4644
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:33,760
keeps all the companies accountable
 

4645
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,990
keeps all the companies accountable
right like

4646
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:36,000
right like
 

4647
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:36,950
right like
if you

4648
01:11:36,950 --> 01:11:36,960
if you
 

4649
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,310
if you
if you want to access the visa network

4650
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:38,320
if you want to access the visa network
 

4651
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:39,510
if you want to access the visa network
there's only one company in the world

4652
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:39,520
there's only one company in the world
 

4653
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:41,510
there's only one company in the world
you can go through to do that like visa

4654
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:41,520
you can go through to do that like visa
 

4655
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:42,870
you can go through to do that like visa
but if you want to access the bitcoin

4656
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:42,880
but if you want to access the bitcoin
 

4657
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,950
but if you want to access the bitcoin
network there's dozens or hundreds of

4658
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:44,960
network there's dozens or hundreds of
 

4659
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,030
network there's dozens or hundreds of
companies out there who can do that so

4660
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:47,040
companies out there who can do that so
 

4661
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,189
companies out there who can do that so
it's you know it's arguably you could

4662
01:11:49,189 --> 01:11:49,199
it's you know it's arguably you could
 

4663
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:51,430
it's you know it's arguably you could
argue it's worse for us as a company but

4664
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:51,440
argue it's worse for us as a company but
 

4665
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,590
argue it's worse for us as a company but
i think it's better for it's what makes

4666
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:53,600
i think it's better for it's what makes
 

4667
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,189
i think it's better for it's what makes
bitcoin interesting and cryptocurrency

4668
01:11:55,189 --> 01:11:55,199
bitcoin interesting and cryptocurrency
 

4669
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:57,910
bitcoin interesting and cryptocurrency
interesting is that nobody controls it

4670
01:11:57,910 --> 01:11:57,920
interesting is that nobody controls it
 

4671
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,350
interesting is that nobody controls it
there is low switching cost for

4672
01:11:59,350 --> 01:11:59,360
there is low switching cost for
 

4673
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,189
there is low switching cost for
customers it's better for customers and

4674
01:12:01,189 --> 01:12:01,199
customers it's better for customers and
 

4675
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:02,790
customers it's better for customers and
that means that all the companies in the

4676
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:02,800
that means that all the companies in the
 

4677
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,070
that means that all the companies in the
space are going to be held to a high

4678
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:04,080
space are going to be held to a high
 

4679
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,510
space are going to be held to a high
standard because the minute you lose

4680
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:05,520
standard because the minute you lose
 

4681
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,390
standard because the minute you lose
someone's trust they're going to move

4682
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:06,400
someone's trust they're going to move
 

4683
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,390
someone's trust they're going to move
their bitcoin to some other service

4684
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:08,400
their bitcoin to some other service
 

4685
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,229
their bitcoin to some other service
and that's good for the world do you

4686
01:12:10,229 --> 01:12:10,239
and that's good for the world do you
 

4687
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:13,030
and that's good for the world do you
think of coinbase as uh so there's these

4688
01:12:13,030 --> 01:12:13,040
think of coinbase as uh so there's these
 

4689
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,430
think of coinbase as uh so there's these
ideas of layer one layer two layer three

4690
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:15,440
ideas of layer one layer two layer three
 

4691
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,430
ideas of layer one layer two layer three
technologies yeah do you think of

4692
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:17,440
technologies yeah do you think of
 

4693
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:18,790
technologies yeah do you think of
coinbase

4694
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:18,800
coinbase
 

4695
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,750
coinbase
as layer one layer two layer three now

4696
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:21,760
as layer one layer two layer three now
 

4697
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:22,550
as layer one layer two layer three now
that

4698
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:22,560
that
 

4699
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,430
that
that said there's so many

4700
01:12:25,430 --> 01:12:25,440
that said there's so many
 

4701
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:26,550
that said there's so many
um

4702
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:26,560
um
 

4703
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,229
um
products that are under the coinbase

4704
01:12:28,229 --> 01:12:28,239
products that are under the coinbase
 

4705
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:29,750
products that are under the coinbase
umbrella that's hard to answer that

4706
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:29,760
umbrella that's hard to answer that
 

4707
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,510
umbrella that's hard to answer that
question but what do you think

4708
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:31,520
question but what do you think
 

4709
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,030
question but what do you think
yeah do you acknowledge the existence of

4710
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:33,040
yeah do you acknowledge the existence of
 

4711
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,270
yeah do you acknowledge the existence of
layer three

4712
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:35,280
layer three
 

4713
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:38,070
layer three
so so you know usually when people are

4714
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:38,080
so so you know usually when people are
 

4715
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,350
so so you know usually when people are
using those terms layer one layer to

4716
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:39,360
using those terms layer one layer to
 

4717
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:40,630
using those terms layer one layer to
this so they're referring to like layer

4718
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:40,640
this so they're referring to like layer
 

4719
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:43,110
this so they're referring to like layer
one would be um the blockchain layer one

4720
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:43,120
one would be um the blockchain layer one
 

4721
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:44,550
one would be um the blockchain layer one
blockchain itself like like a bitcoin or

4722
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:44,560
blockchain itself like like a bitcoin or
 

4723
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,709
blockchain itself like like a bitcoin or
ethereum or something not like a a

4724
01:12:46,709 --> 01:12:46,719
ethereum or something not like a a
 

4725
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:48,149
ethereum or something not like a a
centralized service like coinbase or

4726
01:12:48,149 --> 01:12:48,159
centralized service like coinbase or
 

4727
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:50,630
centralized service like coinbase or
even our decentralized um self-custodial

4728
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:50,640
even our decentralized um self-custodial
 

4729
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:51,669
even our decentralized um self-custodial
wallet

4730
01:12:51,669 --> 01:12:51,679
wallet
 

4731
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:54,070
wallet
so um

4732
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:54,080
so um
 

4733
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,590
so um
yeah i wouldn't consider us to be like a

4734
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:55,600
yeah i wouldn't consider us to be like a
 

4735
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,350
yeah i wouldn't consider us to be like a
layer one these are these are the

4736
01:12:57,350 --> 01:12:57,360
layer one these are these are the
 

4737
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,110
layer one these are these are the
decentralized protocols that we're

4738
01:12:59,110 --> 01:12:59,120
decentralized protocols that we're
 

4739
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:00,870
decentralized protocols that we're
integrating but we are coinbase itself

4740
01:13:00,870 --> 01:13:00,880
integrating but we are coinbase itself
 

4741
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:03,590
integrating but we are coinbase itself
is not those yes but layer two is the

4742
01:13:03,590 --> 01:13:03,600
is not those yes but layer two is the
 

4743
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,350
is not those yes but layer two is the
thing that was basically doing

4744
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:05,360
thing that was basically doing
 

4745
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:07,510
thing that was basically doing
transactions without the settlement

4746
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:07,520
transactions without the settlement
 

4747
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,950
transactions without the settlement
on the blockchain

4748
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:08,960
on the blockchain
 

4749
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,630
on the blockchain
and so you you get to have some of the

4750
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:10,640
and so you you get to have some of the
 

4751
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,950
and so you you get to have some of the
benefits of faster transactions without

4752
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:12,960
benefits of faster transactions without
 

4753
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,149
benefits of faster transactions without
um

4754
01:13:14,149 --> 01:13:14,159
um
 

4755
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:15,669
um
the the security associated with the

4756
01:13:15,669 --> 01:13:15,679
the the security associated with the
 

4757
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:17,189
the the security associated with the
blockchain and

4758
01:13:17,189 --> 01:13:17,199
blockchain and
 

4759
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:18,630
blockchain and
layer three

4760
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:18,640
layer three
 

4761
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,149
layer three
is i suppose

4762
01:13:20,149 --> 01:13:20,159
is i suppose
 

4763
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:22,950
is i suppose
sort of apps built on top of that

4764
01:13:22,950 --> 01:13:22,960
sort of apps built on top of that
 

4765
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,510
sort of apps built on top of that
so you know uh at least i think talking

4766
01:13:25,510 --> 01:13:25,520
so you know uh at least i think talking
 

4767
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,990
so you know uh at least i think talking
to michael saylor he considers coinbase

4768
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:28,000
to michael saylor he considers coinbase
 

4769
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,830
to michael saylor he considers coinbase
a layer three technology

4770
01:13:29,830 --> 01:13:29,840
a layer three technology
 

4771
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:30,830
a layer three technology
interesting

4772
01:13:30,830 --> 01:13:30,840
interesting
 

4773
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,270
interesting
okay i'm not really

4774
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:33,280
okay i'm not really
 

4775
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,350
okay i'm not really
particularly familiar with this kind of

4776
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:35,360
particularly familiar with this kind of
 

4777
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,430
particularly familiar with this kind of
distinctional there three and two i

4778
01:13:37,430 --> 01:13:37,440
distinctional there three and two i
 

4779
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:38,790
distinctional there three and two i
don't see them as fundamentally

4780
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:38,800
don't see them as fundamentally
 

4781
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:39,990
don't see them as fundamentally
different

4782
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:40,000
different
 

4783
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,350
different
uh but

4784
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:41,360
uh but
 

4785
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,950
uh but
some of the okay i mean one way of

4786
01:13:42,950 --> 01:13:42,960
some of the okay i mean one way of
 

4787
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,630
some of the okay i mean one way of
asking that

4788
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:44,640
asking that
 

4789
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,510
asking that
is there some layer two like of magic

4790
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:47,520
is there some layer two like of magic
 

4791
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,510
is there some layer two like of magic
happening in order to make transactions

4792
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:49,520
happening in order to make transactions
 

4793
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:52,709
happening in order to make transactions
associated with the blockchain happen

4794
01:13:52,709 --> 01:13:52,719
associated with the blockchain happen
 

4795
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:55,350
associated with the blockchain happen
instant so that they're quick

4796
01:13:55,350 --> 01:13:55,360
instant so that they're quick
 

4797
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,070
instant so that they're quick
so that coinbase on coinbase yeah

4798
01:13:58,070 --> 01:13:58,080
so that coinbase on coinbase yeah
 

4799
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,149
so that coinbase on coinbase yeah
um is there some magic going on because

4800
01:14:00,149 --> 01:14:00,159
um is there some magic going on because
 

4801
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:02,229
um is there some magic going on because
you're okay we should say how many

4802
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:02,239
you're okay we should say how many
 

4803
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:03,990
you're okay we should say how many
cryptocurrencies are currently on

4804
01:14:03,990 --> 01:14:04,000
cryptocurrencies are currently on
 

4805
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,310
cryptocurrencies are currently on
coinbase so it's more than two

4806
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:06,320
coinbase so it's more than two
 

4807
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,350
coinbase so it's more than two
yeah

4808
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:07,360
yeah
 

4809
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,110
yeah
it's a lot more than two yeah so you

4810
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:09,120
it's a lot more than two yeah so you
 

4811
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,630
it's a lot more than two yeah so you
have to understand they have to

4812
01:14:10,630 --> 01:14:10,640
have to understand they have to
 

4813
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:13,669
have to understand they have to
incorporate all these technologies yeah

4814
01:14:13,669 --> 01:14:13,679
incorporate all these technologies yeah
 

4815
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:16,070
incorporate all these technologies yeah
so how do you make that magic

4816
01:14:16,070 --> 01:14:16,080
so how do you make that magic
 

4817
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,709
so how do you make that magic
of sort of universal transactions happen

4818
01:14:18,709 --> 01:14:18,719
of sort of universal transactions happen
 

4819
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:19,990
of sort of universal transactions happen
across all of these different

4820
01:14:19,990 --> 01:14:20,000
across all of these different
 

4821
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,110
across all of these different
cryptocurrencies

4822
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:23,120

 

4823
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,470

there's our centralized products and

4824
01:14:24,470 --> 01:14:24,480
there's our centralized products and
 

4825
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:25,750
there's our centralized products and
decentralized products right the

4826
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:25,760
decentralized products right the
 

4827
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:27,350
decentralized products right the
centralized products

4828
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:27,360
centralized products
 

4829
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,669
centralized products
um we are storing

4830
01:14:29,669 --> 01:14:29,679
um we are storing
 

4831
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:31,830
um we are storing
that crypto for you and so if you're

4832
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:31,840
that crypto for you and so if you're
 

4833
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,350
that crypto for you and so if you're
moving from one of your accounts to

4834
01:14:33,350 --> 01:14:33,360
moving from one of your accounts to
 

4835
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:34,630
moving from one of your accounts to
another account like

4836
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:34,640
another account like
 

4837
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,950
another account like
each one account to eth2 account or

4838
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:36,960
each one account to eth2 account or
 

4839
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:39,030
each one account to eth2 account or
um from my ether ethe coinbase

4840
01:14:39,030 --> 01:14:39,040
um from my ether ethe coinbase
 

4841
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,030
um from my ether ethe coinbase
centralized account to your ether so we

4842
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:41,040
centralized account to your ether so we
 

4843
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:42,790
centralized account to your ether so we
can do that transaction off chain to

4844
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:42,800
can do that transaction off chain to
 

4845
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,709
can do that transaction off chain to
make it faster and it saves the customer

4846
01:14:44,709 --> 01:14:44,719
make it faster and it saves the customer
 

4847
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:46,950
make it faster and it saves the customer
fees and it just confirms instantly but

4848
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:46,960
fees and it just confirms instantly but
 

4849
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,630
fees and it just confirms instantly but
it's not truly using the decentralized

4850
01:14:48,630 --> 01:14:48,640
it's not truly using the decentralized
 

4851
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,709
it's not truly using the decentralized
blockchain right so you can also send to

4852
01:14:50,709 --> 01:14:50,719
blockchain right so you can also send to
 

4853
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:52,470
blockchain right so you can also send to
any any bitcoin address or a theorem

4854
01:14:52,470 --> 01:14:52,480
any any bitcoin address or a theorem
 

4855
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,470
any any bitcoin address or a theorem
address for instance and that is putting

4856
01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:54,480
address for instance and that is putting
 

4857
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,630
address for instance and that is putting
the transaction on chain now our

4858
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:56,640
the transaction on chain now our
 

4859
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,709
the transaction on chain now our
decentralized products like coinbase

4860
01:14:58,709 --> 01:14:58,719
decentralized products like coinbase
 

4861
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:00,870
decentralized products like coinbase
wallet the the self custodial wallet

4862
01:15:00,870 --> 01:15:00,880
wallet the the self custodial wallet
 

4863
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,550
wallet the the self custodial wallet
every transaction is happening on chain

4864
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:02,560
every transaction is happening on chain
 

4865
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,030
every transaction is happening on chain
with that and so basically what it just

4866
01:15:05,030 --> 01:15:05,040
with that and so basically what it just
 

4867
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,310
with that and so basically what it just
shows a little bit of the evolution of

4868
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:06,320
shows a little bit of the evolution of
 

4869
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,830
shows a little bit of the evolution of
coinbase and the blockchains themselves

4870
01:15:07,830 --> 01:15:07,840
coinbase and the blockchains themselves
 

4871
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:11,110
coinbase and the blockchains themselves
like in the early days um these you know

4872
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:11,120
like in the early days um these you know
 

4873
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,110
like in the early days um these you know
the we these networks were not scalable

4874
01:15:13,110 --> 01:15:13,120
the we these networks were not scalable
 

4875
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:15,350
the we these networks were not scalable
and so there were no l2 solutions for

4876
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:15,360
and so there were no l2 solutions for
 

4877
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,630
and so there were no l2 solutions for
instance

4878
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:16,640
instance
 

4879
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,390
instance
and so we had to do sort of these hacks

4880
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:18,400
and so we had to do sort of these hacks
 

4881
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,149
and so we had to do sort of these hacks
like moving the crypto off chain if you

4882
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:20,159
like moving the crypto off chain if you
 

4883
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:21,350
like moving the crypto off chain if you
were moving between your own accounts

4884
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:21,360
were moving between your own accounts
 

4885
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,350
were moving between your own accounts
and stuff like that otherwise the miner

4886
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:23,360
and stuff like that otherwise the miner
 

4887
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,630
and stuff like that otherwise the miner
fees would have just eaten us alive as a

4888
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:24,640
fees would have just eaten us alive as a
 

4889
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,870
fees would have just eaten us alive as a
company right and we yeah but now that

4890
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:26,880
company right and we yeah but now that
 

4891
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:27,590
company right and we yeah but now that
like

4892
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:27,600
like
 

4893
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:28,870
like
the blockchains are starting to scale

4894
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:28,880
the blockchains are starting to scale
 

4895
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:29,830
the blockchains are starting to scale
there's a whole bunch more work that

4896
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:29,840
there's a whole bunch more work that
 

4897
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:30,709
there's a whole bunch more work that
needs to be done on that and we're

4898
01:15:30,709 --> 01:15:30,719
needs to be done on that and we're
 

4899
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:32,870
needs to be done on that and we're
getting l2 solutions so i think more and

4900
01:15:32,870 --> 01:15:32,880
getting l2 solutions so i think more and
 

4901
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,310
getting l2 solutions so i think more and
more of the transactions are going on

4902
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:34,320
more of the transactions are going on
 

4903
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,550
more of the transactions are going on
chain whether it's l2 l1

4904
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:36,560
chain whether it's l2 l1
 

4905
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,910
chain whether it's l2 l1
and you know we shouldn't be like

4906
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:39,920
and you know we shouldn't be like
 

4907
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:41,430
and you know we shouldn't be like
ideally we shouldn't be doing that many

4908
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:41,440
ideally we shouldn't be doing that many
 

4909
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:45,110
ideally we shouldn't be doing that many
transactions um you know off chain but

4910
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:45,120
transactions um you know off chain but
 

4911
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,630
transactions um you know off chain but
just internal coinbase ledger or

4912
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:46,640
just internal coinbase ledger or
 

4913
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:47,750
just internal coinbase ledger or
something that's not really in the

4914
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:47,760
something that's not really in the
 

4915
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,270
something that's not really in the
spirit of crypto so when you say

4916
01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:49,280
spirit of crypto so when you say
 

4917
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:50,870
spirit of crypto so when you say
unchained that includes like a lightning

4918
01:15:50,870 --> 01:15:50,880
unchained that includes like a lightning
 

4919
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,709
unchained that includes like a lightning
net that includes layer

4920
01:15:52,709 --> 01:15:52,719
net that includes layer
 

4921
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:55,669
net that includes layer
layer two technology that the blockchain

4922
01:15:55,669 --> 01:15:55,679
layer two technology that the blockchain
 

4923
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:58,470
layer two technology that the blockchain
proposes yeah so you're when you yeah

4924
01:15:58,470 --> 01:15:58,480
proposes yeah so you're when you yeah
 

4925
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,870
proposes yeah so you're when you yeah
okay so i guess i was asking how much

4926
01:16:00,870 --> 01:16:00,880
okay so i guess i was asking how much
 

4927
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:03,750
okay so i guess i was asking how much
fun magic is happening off-chain within

4928
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:03,760
fun magic is happening off-chain within
 

4929
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,430
fun magic is happening off-chain within
coinbase and you're saying in the early

4930
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:05,440
coinbase and you're saying in the early
 

4931
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,189
coinbase and you're saying in the early
days you had to

4932
01:16:07,189 --> 01:16:07,199
days you had to
 

4933
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:09,430
days you had to
but you try and do less and less

4934
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:09,440
but you try and do less and less
 

4935
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,709
but you try and do less and less
so look there's a bunch of like high

4936
01:16:10,709 --> 01:16:10,719
so look there's a bunch of like high
 

4937
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:11,910
so look there's a bunch of like high
frequency traders that use the

4938
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:11,920
frequency traders that use the
 

4939
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:14,149
frequency traders that use the
centralized products and even just

4940
01:16:14,149 --> 01:16:14,159
centralized products and even just
 

4941
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:15,750
centralized products and even just
regular retail people like they don't

4942
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:15,760
regular retail people like they don't
 

4943
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:17,590
regular retail people like they don't
want to pay the gas fees and stuff and

4944
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:17,600
want to pay the gas fees and stuff and
 

4945
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,149
want to pay the gas fees and stuff and
they're trying to it actually we we

4946
01:16:20,149 --> 01:16:20,159
they're trying to it actually we we
 

4947
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:22,390
they're trying to it actually we we
um back at the envelope you know

4948
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:22,400
um back at the envelope you know
 

4949
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,070
um back at the envelope you know
calculated this out at one point

4950
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:24,080
calculated this out at one point
 

4951
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,430
calculated this out at one point
and just like

4952
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:25,440
and just like
 

4953
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:26,950
and just like
it would be completely infeasible for

4954
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:26,960
it would be completely infeasible for
 

4955
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,310
it would be completely infeasible for
like high frequency traders to put

4956
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:28,320
like high frequency traders to put
 

4957
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:29,830
like high frequency traders to put
everything on chain at this point that's

4958
01:16:29,830 --> 01:16:29,840
everything on chain at this point that's
 

4959
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:32,470
everything on chain at this point that's
basically what dexes are doing and so

4960
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:32,480
basically what dexes are doing and so
 

4961
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,390
basically what dexes are doing and so
both are important i think more and more

4962
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:34,400
both are important i think more and more
 

4963
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,149
both are important i think more and more
is going to move decentralized over time

4964
01:16:36,149 --> 01:16:36,159
is going to move decentralized over time
 

4965
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:37,910
is going to move decentralized over time
which is great and we're and we're

4966
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:37,920
which is great and we're and we're
 

4967
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,510
which is great and we're and we're
basically our decentralized exchanges

4968
01:16:39,510 --> 01:16:39,520
basically our decentralized exchanges
 

4969
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:41,669
basically our decentralized exchanges
yeah by the way yeah yeah

4970
01:16:41,669 --> 01:16:41,679
yeah by the way yeah yeah
 

4971
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:42,550
yeah by the way yeah yeah
um

4972
01:16:42,550 --> 01:16:42,560
um
 

4973
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:44,310
um
so anyway we want to we want to

4974
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:44,320
so anyway we want to we want to
 

4975
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,590
so anyway we want to we want to
encourage more and more of it to move

4976
01:16:45,590 --> 01:16:45,600
encourage more and more of it to move
 

4977
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,270
encourage more and more of it to move
decentralized over time but i don't the

4978
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:47,280
decentralized over time but i don't the
 

4979
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,870
decentralized over time but i don't the
centralized things aren't going away for

4980
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:48,880
centralized things aren't going away for
 

4981
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:51,189
centralized things aren't going away for
like a long time it's a decade from now

4982
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:51,199
like a long time it's a decade from now
 

4983
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:53,030
like a long time it's a decade from now
there's gonna be some

4984
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:53,040
there's gonna be some
 

4985
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,910
there's gonna be some
big institution or pension fund or

4986
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:55,920
big institution or pension fund or
 

4987
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,189
big institution or pension fund or
central bank that's like all right we

4988
01:16:57,189 --> 01:16:57,199
central bank that's like all right we
 

4989
01:16:57,199 --> 01:16:58,709
central bank that's like all right we
gotta hold crypto

4990
01:16:58,709 --> 01:16:58,719
gotta hold crypto
 

4991
01:16:58,719 --> 01:16:59,830
gotta hold crypto
let's set up the account in a

4992
01:16:59,830 --> 01:16:59,840
let's set up the account in a
 

4993
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,830
let's set up the account in a
centralized way so that's that's fine

4994
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:01,840
centralized way so that's that's fine
 

4995
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,669
centralized way so that's that's fine
both both are important do you know the

4996
01:17:03,669 --> 01:17:03,679
both both are important do you know the
 

4997
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:06,229
both both are important do you know the
number of cryptocurrencies currently on

4998
01:17:06,229 --> 01:17:06,239
number of cryptocurrencies currently on
 

4999
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:08,229
number of cryptocurrencies currently on
coinbase do you know that number it's

5000
01:17:08,229 --> 01:17:08,239
coinbase do you know that number it's
 

5001
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:10,870
coinbase do you know that number it's
over a hundred but it depends it depends

5002
01:17:10,870 --> 01:17:10,880
over a hundred but it depends it depends
 

5003
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,950
over a hundred but it depends it depends
what jurisdiction you're in and you know

5004
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:12,960
what jurisdiction you're in and you know
 

5005
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,709
what jurisdiction you're in and you know
are you um

5006
01:17:14,709 --> 01:17:14,719
are you um
 

5007
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:16,310
are you um
an institution versus retail it's like

5008
01:17:16,310 --> 01:17:16,320
an institution versus retail it's like
 

5009
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:20,070
an institution versus retail it's like
there's so many different categories now

5010
01:17:20,070 --> 01:17:20,080
there's so many different categories now
 

5011
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,510
there's so many different categories now
yeah

5012
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:21,520
yeah
 

5013
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:24,070
yeah
so what does it take to become

5014
01:17:24,070 --> 01:17:24,080
so what does it take to become
 

5015
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,149
so what does it take to become
to to to become an asset to become a

5016
01:17:26,149 --> 01:17:26,159
to to to become an asset to become a
 

5017
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:28,830
to to to become an asset to become a
cryptocurrency on coinbase to

5018
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:28,840
cryptocurrency on coinbase to
 

5019
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:33,110
cryptocurrency on coinbase to
add your technology to coinbase

5020
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:33,120
add your technology to coinbase
 

5021
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:35,350
add your technology to coinbase
okay well so we're trying to get away

5022
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:35,360
okay well so we're trying to get away
 

5023
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:37,669
okay well so we're trying to get away
from this idea of being listed on

5024
01:17:37,669 --> 01:17:37,679
from this idea of being listed on
 

5025
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:39,189
from this idea of being listed on
coinbase as being seen as like an

5026
01:17:39,189 --> 01:17:39,199
coinbase as being seen as like an
 

5027
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:41,189
coinbase as being seen as like an
endorsement or something because

5028
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:41,199
endorsement or something because
 

5029
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:42,470
endorsement or something because
i actually think it's very important

5030
01:17:42,470 --> 01:17:42,480
i actually think it's very important
 

5031
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:45,430
i actually think it's very important

process right
 

5055
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:03,590

and so

5056
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:03,600
and so
 

5057
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:04,950
and so
something that you think like a

01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,750
looks silly may turn out to be the next
big thing right and so it's very

5064
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:09,760
big thing right and so it's very
 

5065
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:12,149
big thing right and so it's very
difficult so what do we do i mean we

5066
01:18:12,149 --> 01:18:12,159
difficult so what do we do i mean we
 

5067
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:14,870
difficult so what do we do i mean we
basically have a test of legality right

5068
01:18:14,870 --> 01:18:14,880
basically have a test of legality right
 

5069
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:17,189
basically have a test of legality right
we we check um

5070
01:18:17,189 --> 01:18:17,199
we we check um
 

5071
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:18,950
we we check um
you know do we belie do we believe this

01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:25,110
on coinbase and there's a very rigorous
process we go through for that um just

5078
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:25,120
process we go through for that um just
 

5079
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:26,550
process we go through for that um just
currently the way the laws are in the us

you can't you can't do that and we've
 

5083
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,070
you can't you can't do that and we've
been we acquired a broker dealer license

5084
01:18:30,070 --> 01:18:30,080
been we acquired a broker dealer license
 

5085
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,590
been we acquired a broker dealer license
from the sec we're trying to work with

5086
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:31,600
from the sec we're trying to work with
 

5087
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:32,790
from the sec we're trying to work with
them to get that operational and

5088
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:32,800
them to get that operational and
 

5089
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,310
them to get that operational and
hopefully someday we can trade real

5090
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:34,320
hopefully someday we can trade real
 

5091
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,310
hopefully someday we can trade real
crypto securities but today that's not

5092
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:36,320
crypto securities but today that's not
 

5093
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,229
crypto securities but today that's not
possible in the us at least

5094
01:18:38,229 --> 01:18:38,239
possible in the us at least
 

5095
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:40,229
possible in the us at least
um then we look at sort of the cyber

5096
01:18:40,229 --> 01:18:40,239
um then we look at sort of the cyber
 

5097
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:42,709
um then we look at sort of the cyber
security of the the crypto asset does it

5098
01:18:42,709 --> 01:18:42,719
security of the the crypto asset does it
 

5099
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:44,310
security of the the crypto asset does it
do we think there's some flaw in the

5100
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:44,320
do we think there's some flaw in the
 

5101
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,630
do we think there's some flaw in the
smart contract or

5102
01:18:46,630 --> 01:18:46,640
smart contract or
 

5103
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,470
smart contract or
you know a way that somebody could um

5104
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:48,480
you know a way that somebody could um
 

5105
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,470
you know a way that somebody could um
manipulate it without the customer's

5106
01:18:50,470 --> 01:18:50,480
manipulate it without the customer's
 

5107
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,310
manipulate it without the customer's
permission

5108
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:52,320
permission
 

5109
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,310
permission
we look at some compliance pieces to it

5110
01:18:54,310 --> 01:18:54,320
we look at some compliance pieces to it
 

5111
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,590
we look at some compliance pieces to it
as well like the

5112
01:18:55,590 --> 01:18:55,600
as well like the
 

5113
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,430
as well like the
the actors behind it and like you know

5114
01:18:57,430 --> 01:18:57,440
the actors behind it and like you know
 

5115
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,030
the actors behind it and like you know
they're any kind of criminal history

5116
01:18:59,030 --> 01:18:59,040
they're any kind of criminal history
 

5117
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,709
they're any kind of criminal history
anything like that but if we believe it

5118
01:19:00,709 --> 01:19:00,719
anything like that but if we believe it
 

5119
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:01,990
anything like that but if we believe it
meets our our

5120
01:19:01,990 --> 01:19:02,000
meets our our
 

5121
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,070
meets our our
listing standards basically the this

5122
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:04,080
listing standards basically the this
 

5123
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,470
listing standards basically the this
test of um legality and everything for

5124
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:06,480
test of um legality and everything for
 

5125
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,790
test of um legality and everything for
for customer protection then we want to

5126
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:08,800
for customer protection then we want to
 

5127
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,550
for customer protection then we want to
list it because we want the market to at

5128
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:10,560
list it because we want the market to at
 

5129
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,550
list it because we want the market to at
that point decide and it's kind of like

5130
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:12,560
that point decide and it's kind of like
 

5131
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:13,669
that point decide and it's kind of like
um

5132
01:19:13,669 --> 01:19:13,679
um
 

5133
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:15,110
um
it's kind of like amazon or something

5134
01:19:15,110 --> 01:19:15,120
it's kind of like amazon or something
 

5135
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,910
it's kind of like amazon or something
like that where you know it a product

5136
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:17,920
like that where you know it a product
 

5137
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,110
like that where you know it a product
might have three stars or it might have

5138
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:19,120
might have three stars or it might have
 

5139
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,430
might have three stars or it might have
five stars but if it starts to get one

5140
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:21,440
five stars but if it starts to get one
 

5141
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:23,110
five stars but if it starts to get one
star consistently like it's probably

5142
01:19:23,110 --> 01:19:23,120
star consistently like it's probably
 

5143
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,630
star consistently like it's probably
fraudulent or it's defective or

5144
01:19:24,630 --> 01:19:24,640
fraudulent or it's defective or
 

5145
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,070
fraudulent or it's defective or
something like maybe amazon will remove

5146
01:19:26,070 --> 01:19:26,080
something like maybe amazon will remove
 

5147
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:28,070
something like maybe amazon will remove
it but otherwise you want to let the

5148
01:19:28,070 --> 01:19:28,080
it but otherwise you want to let the
 

5149
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,390
it but otherwise you want to let the
market decide what these things are

5150
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:30,400
market decide what these things are
 

5151
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:31,189
market decide what these things are
um

5152
01:19:31,189 --> 01:19:31,199
um
 

5153
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:33,030
um
so that's generally how we do it and by

5154
01:19:33,030 --> 01:19:33,040
so that's generally how we do it and by
 

5155
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:34,870
so that's generally how we do it and by
the way more and more of these

5156
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:34,880
the way more and more of these
 

5157
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:37,270
the way more and more of these
assets um i think especially like low

5158
01:19:37,270 --> 01:19:37,280
assets um i think especially like low
 

5159
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,030
assets um i think especially like low
market cap assets are going to be traded

5160
01:19:39,030 --> 01:19:39,040
market cap assets are going to be traded
 

5161
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,950
market cap assets are going to be traded
on dexes through coinbase it's not that

5162
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:40,960
on dexes through coinbase it's not that
 

5163
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:42,630
on dexes through coinbase it's not that
we

5164
01:19:42,630 --> 01:19:42,640
we
 

5165
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:44,229
we
we don't need to list every asset on a

5166
01:19:44,229 --> 01:19:44,239
we don't need to list every asset on a
 

5167
01:19:44,239 --> 01:19:45,910
we don't need to list every asset on a
centralized exchange i think dexes are

5168
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:45,920
centralized exchange i think dexes are
 

5169
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,910
centralized exchange i think dexes are
really good for the long tail and then

5170
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:47,920
really good for the long tail and then
 

5171
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,510
really good for the long tail and then
it becomes an even

5172
01:19:49,510 --> 01:19:49,520
it becomes an even
 

5173
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,030
it becomes an even
it's even more clear to people like this

5174
01:19:51,030 --> 01:19:51,040
it's even more clear to people like this
 

5175
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:53,030
it's even more clear to people like this
is not some endorsement by a coinbase of

5176
01:19:53,030 --> 01:19:53,040
is not some endorsement by a coinbase of
 

5177
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:53,830
is not some endorsement by a coinbase of
like

5178
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:53,840
like
 

5179
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,590
like
this assets good and this one's bad like

5180
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:55,600
this assets good and this one's bad like
 

5181
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,350
this assets good and this one's bad like
you know my belief is there's going to

5182
01:19:57,350 --> 01:19:57,360
you know my belief is there's going to
 

5183
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:58,950
you know my belief is there's going to
be millions of these assets over time

5184
01:19:58,950 --> 01:19:58,960
be millions of these assets over time
 

5185
01:19:58,960 --> 01:19:59,910
be millions of these assets over time
and so

5186
01:19:59,910 --> 01:19:59,920
and so
 

5187
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:00,870
and so
um

5188
01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:00,880
um
 

5189
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,390
um
i hope it doesn't like make news every

5190
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:02,400
i hope it doesn't like make news every
 

5191
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:03,750
i hope it doesn't like make news every
time we add one in the future basically

5192
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:03,760
time we add one in the future basically
 

5193
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:06,229
time we add one in the future basically
yeah i wonder how you get there because

5194
01:20:06,229 --> 01:20:06,239
yeah i wonder how you get there because
 

5195
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:09,110
yeah i wonder how you get there because
i even i look to coinbase

5196
01:20:09,110 --> 01:20:09,120
i even i look to coinbase
 

5197
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,750
i even i look to coinbase
for for example you know people as you

5198
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:11,760
for for example you know people as you
 

5199
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:12,950
for for example you know people as you
could imagine

5200
01:20:12,950 --> 01:20:12,960
could imagine
 

5201
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:14,149
could imagine
sort of tagged me on twitter or

5202
01:20:14,149 --> 01:20:14,159
sort of tagged me on twitter or
 

5203

sort of tagged me on twitter or
something like that and all that like

5204
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:16,960
something like that and all that like
 

5205
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:18,870
something like that and all that like
you should interview

5206
01:20:18,870 --> 01:20:18,880
you should interview
 

5207
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,510
you should interview
our sort of this the the founder of this

a scam
 

5227
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:46,070
a scam
and i you know there's very few sources

5228
01:20:46,070 --> 01:20:46,080
and i you know there's very few sources
 

5229

of uh
 

5231
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:50,390
of uh
like verification signal

5232
01:20:50,390 --> 01:20:50,400
like verification signal
 

5233
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,870
like verification signal
and unfortunately coinbase in part has

5234
01:20:52,870 --> 01:20:52,880
and unfortunately coinbase in part has
 

5235
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:53,910
and unfortunately coinbase in part has
become

become
 

5237
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,750
become
a little bit of that too and you're

amazon star type system

5246
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:03,760
amazon star type system
 

5247
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,590
amazon star type system
where the people could rate

5248
01:21:05,590 --> 01:21:05,600
where the people could rate
 

5249
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,030
where the people could rate
yeah so i think we'll actually probably

5250
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:07,040
yeah so i think we'll actually probably
 

5251
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:09,669
yeah so i think we'll actually probably
add like user ratings and reviews so um

5252
01:21:09,669 --> 01:21:09,679
add like user ratings and reviews so um
 

5253
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:11,830
add like user ratings and reviews so um
and and we'll be very cautious about

5254
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:11,840
and and we'll be very cautious about
 

5255
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:15,270
and and we'll be very cautious about
like you know these are real people um

5256
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:15,280
like you know these are real people um

5259
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,629
there's a bunch of stuff we have to do
from that already so i think wisdom of

5260
01:21:18,629 --> 01:21:18,639
from that already so i think wisdom of
 

5261
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:20,390
from that already so i think wisdom of
the crowds is good in terms of getting

5262
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:20,400
the crowds is good in terms of getting
 

5263

um there's a difference between
 

5311
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:12,070
um there's a difference between
something which is

5312

something which is
 

5313
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:14,390
something which is
just a me too product it's like it

just a me too product it's like it
 

5315
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,750
just a me too product it's like it
doesn't have anything interesting about

5316
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:15,760
doesn't have anything interesting about
 

5317
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:17,270
doesn't have anything interesting about
it and something that's an actual fraud

um
 

5323
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,350
um
you have to a lot of this data what's

5324
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:21,360
you have to a lot of this data what's
 

5325
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:22,870
you have to a lot of this data what's
cool about it is that it's now available

5326
01:22:22,870 --> 01:22:22,880
cool about it is that it's now available
 

5327
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,229
cool about it is that it's now available
on chain you can look at like the

5328
01:22:24,229 --> 01:22:24,239
on chain you can look at like the
 

5329
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:25,910
on chain you can look at like the
tokenomics behind it and see who owns

5330
01:22:25,910 --> 01:22:25,920
tokenomics behind it and see who owns
 

5331
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,470
tokenomics behind it and see who owns
economics and are they yeah and are they

5332
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:28,480
economics and are they yeah and are they
 

5333
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,470
economics and are they yeah and are they
selling it you know

pumping it on like youtube and twitter
and making promises about hey the value

5340
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:38,560
and making promises about hey the value
 

5341
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:39,750
and making promises about hey the value
of this thing may be a higher in the

5342
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:39,760
of this thing may be a higher in the
 

5343
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,430
of this thing may be a higher in the
future and like all those are just big

5344
01:22:41,430 --> 01:22:41,440
future and like all those are just big
 

5345
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:43,270
future and like all those are just big
big no-nos that we would

tricky industry because i'm trying to
 

5367
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:03,189
tricky industry because i'm trying to
figure out who to you know

5368
01:23:03,189 --> 01:23:03,199
figure out who to you know
 

5369
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:05,910
figure out who to you know
uh what's interesting to to to to

5370
01:23:05,910 --> 01:23:05,920
uh what's interesting to to to to
 

5371
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:08,870
uh what's interesting to to to to
understand to research yeah and uh it's

5372
01:23:08,870 --> 01:23:08,880
understand to research yeah and uh it's
 

5373
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:11,030
understand to research yeah and uh it's
hard to know let me ask you about a

5374
01:23:11,030 --> 01:23:11,040
hard to know let me ask you about a
 

5375
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,870
hard to know let me ask you about a
trick you want to add to a centralized

5376
01:23:12,870 --> 01:23:12,880
trick you want to add to a centralized
 

5377
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,350
trick you want to add to a centralized
exchange which is privacy preserving

5378
01:23:15,350 --> 01:23:15,360
exchange which is privacy preserving
 

5379
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:18,149
exchange which is privacy preserving
cryptocurrency so like monero yeah is

5380
01:23:18,149 --> 01:23:18,159
cryptocurrency so like monero yeah is
 

5381
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:20,390
cryptocurrency so like monero yeah is
that is that technically difficult or is

5382
01:23:20,390 --> 01:23:20,400
that is that technically difficult or is
 

5383
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,510
that is that technically difficult or is
that why

5384
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:21,520
that why
 

5385
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,510
that why
why is like monero for example forget

5386
01:23:23,510 --> 01:23:23,520
why is like monero for example forget
 

5387
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,830
why is like monero for example forget
that specific one but like privacy

5388
01:23:25,830 --> 01:23:25,840
that specific one but like privacy
 

5389
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,030
that specific one but like privacy
preserving

5390
01:23:27,030 --> 01:23:27,040
preserving
 

5391
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:30,470
preserving
cryptocurrency blockchains uh why is

5392
01:23:30,470 --> 01:23:30,480
cryptocurrency blockchains uh why is
 

5393
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:33,189
cryptocurrency blockchains uh why is
that ever possible to add

5394
01:23:33,189 --> 01:23:33,199
that ever possible to add
 

5395
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:35,189
that ever possible to add
so that's that's a great question so the

5396
01:23:35,189 --> 01:23:35,199
so that's that's a great question so the
 

5397
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:36,709
so that's that's a great question so the
answer is maybe

5398
01:23:36,709 --> 01:23:36,719
answer is maybe
 

5399
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:38,229
answer is maybe
so um

5400
01:23:38,229 --> 01:23:38,239
so um
 

5401
01:23:38,239 --> 01:23:39,669
so um
here here's the here's the what the

5402
01:23:39,669 --> 01:23:39,679
here here's the here's the what the
 

5403
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:41,189
here here's the here's the what the
reason why so

5404
01:23:41,189 --> 01:23:41,199
reason why so
 

5405
01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:42,629
reason why so
um because we're a regulated financial

5406
01:23:42,629 --> 01:23:42,639
um because we're a regulated financial
 

5407
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:45,110
um because we're a regulated financial
service business we have various um

5408
01:23:45,110 --> 01:23:45,120
service business we have various um
 

5409
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,709
service business we have various um
licenses to do that we are we are

5410
01:23:46,709 --> 01:23:46,719
licenses to do that we are we are
 

5411
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:48,629
licenses to do that we are we are
regulated by various regulators part of

5412
01:23:48,629 --> 01:23:48,639
regulated by various regulators part of
 

5413
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:50,629
regulated by various regulators part of
those licenses requires us to have a

5414
01:23:50,629 --> 01:23:50,639
those licenses requires us to have a
 

5415
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:53,510
those licenses requires us to have a
quote reasonable um program to monitor

5416
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:53,520
quote reasonable um program to monitor
 

5417
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:54,550
quote reasonable um program to monitor
for

5418
01:23:54,550 --> 01:23:54,560
for
 

5419
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:57,030
for
suspicious activity um

5420
01:23:57,030 --> 01:23:57,040
suspicious activity um
 

5421
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,550
suspicious activity um
you know an aml program anti-money

5422
01:23:58,550 --> 01:23:58,560
you know an aml program anti-money
 

5423
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:01,669
you know an aml program anti-money
laundering right and so if it if a coin

5424
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:01,679
laundering right and so if it if a coin
 

5425
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:04,470
laundering right and so if it if a coin
is 100 anonymous and we can't really do

5426
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:04,480
is 100 anonymous and we can't really do
 

5427
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,390
is 100 anonymous and we can't really do
blockchain analytics to track

5428
01:24:06,390 --> 01:24:06,400
blockchain analytics to track
 

5429
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,310
blockchain analytics to track
um sorts of funds and where these things

5430
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:08,320
um sorts of funds and where these things
 

5431
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,510
um sorts of funds and where these things
might be going

5432
01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:09,520
might be going
 

5433
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:12,310
might be going
it makes it harder to have a

5434
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:12,320
it makes it harder to have a
 

5435
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,950
it makes it harder to have a
um a reasonable program around that

5436
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:14,960
um a reasonable program around that
 

5437
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:17,830
um a reasonable program around that
that's defensible now there are privacy

5438
01:24:17,830 --> 01:24:17,840
that's defensible now there are privacy
 

5439
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,590
that's defensible now there are privacy
preserving coins like zcash which have

5440
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:19,600
preserving coins like zcash which have
 

5441
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,510
preserving coins like zcash which have
something called a view key and a view

5442
01:24:21,510 --> 01:24:21,520
something called a view key and a view
 

5443
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:23,350
something called a view key and a view
key is basically another key which

5444
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:23,360
key is basically another key which
 

5445
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:25,350
key is basically another key which
allows you to de-anonymize the

5446
01:24:25,350 --> 01:24:25,360
allows you to de-anonymize the
 

5447
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:26,870
allows you to de-anonymize the
transactions in specific situations

5448
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:26,880
transactions in specific situations
 

5449
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:29,270
transactions in specific situations
where you want that so for instance um

5450
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:29,280
where you want that so for instance um
 

5451
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:31,270
where you want that so for instance um
you know we do support zcash and one of

5452
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:31,280
you know we do support zcash and one of
 

5453
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:32,470
you know we do support zcash and one of
the ways we got comfortable with that is

5454
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:32,480
the ways we got comfortable with that is
 

5455
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:33,510
the ways we got comfortable with that is
that

5456
01:24:33,510 --> 01:24:33,520
that
 

5457
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:36,070
that
when you're buying it on coinbase um you

5458
01:24:36,070 --> 01:24:36,080
when you're buying it on coinbase um you
 

5459
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:38,149
when you're buying it on coinbase um you
know you can basically have a view key

5460
01:24:38,149 --> 01:24:38,159
know you can basically have a view key
 

5461
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:40,149
know you can basically have a view key
the the transactions are not anonymous

5462
01:24:40,149 --> 01:24:40,159
the the transactions are not anonymous
 

5463
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:41,430
the the transactions are not anonymous
while you're buying it and we can see

5464
01:24:41,430 --> 01:24:41,440
while you're buying it and we can see
 

5465
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:43,110
while you're buying it and we can see
where it goes afterwards and do our our

5466
01:24:43,110 --> 01:24:43,120
where it goes afterwards and do our our
 

5467
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,709
where it goes afterwards and do our our
whole standard program

5468
01:24:44,709 --> 01:24:44,719
whole standard program
 

5469
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:47,510
whole standard program
um now if it gets a few hops away down

5470
01:24:47,510 --> 01:24:47,520
um now if it gets a few hops away down
 

5471
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,510
um now if it gets a few hops away down
the road i mean people could eventually

5472
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:49,520
the road i mean people could eventually
 

5473
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,750
the road i mean people could eventually
turn on privacy preserving aspects

5474
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:51,760
turn on privacy preserving aspects
 

5475
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,430
turn on privacy preserving aspects
so you know these are tough judgment

5476
01:24:53,430 --> 01:24:53,440
so you know these are tough judgment
 

5477
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:55,110
so you know these are tough judgment
calls but at least in terms of our

5478
01:24:55,110 --> 01:24:55,120
calls but at least in terms of our
 

5479
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:56,470
calls but at least in terms of our
interaction with the customer and

5480
01:24:56,470 --> 01:24:56,480
interaction with the customer and
 

5481
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:58,470
interaction with the customer and
everything we feel comfortable at that

5482
01:24:58,470 --> 01:24:58,480
everything we feel comfortable at that
 

5483
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,229
everything we feel comfortable at that
i think there's a broader point here

5484
01:25:00,229 --> 01:25:00,239
i think there's a broader point here
 

5485
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:02,550
i think there's a broader point here
which is that i actually think privacy

5486
01:25:02,550 --> 01:25:02,560
which is that i actually think privacy
 

5487
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:04,310
which is that i actually think privacy
coins are a good thing for the world and

5488
01:25:04,310 --> 01:25:04,320
coins are a good thing for the world and
 

5489
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,310
coins are a good thing for the world and
we and they should be allowed and more

5490
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:06,320
we and they should be allowed and more
 

5491
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:07,990
we and they should be allowed and more
like you know

5492
01:25:07,990 --> 01:25:08,000
like you know
 

5493
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,830
like you know
despite we've made this judgment call to

5494
01:25:09,830 --> 01:25:09,840
despite we've made this judgment call to
 

5495
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,270
despite we've made this judgment call to
operate in a regulated and safe and

5496
01:25:11,270 --> 01:25:11,280
operate in a regulated and safe and
 

5497
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,950
operate in a regulated and safe and
compliant way but

5498
01:25:12,950 --> 01:25:12,960
compliant way but
 

5499
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,870
compliant way but
just taking my coinbase head off for a

5500
01:25:14,870 --> 01:25:14,880
just taking my coinbase head off for a
 

5501
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,149
just taking my coinbase head off for a
minute i think the world would be a

5502
01:25:16,149 --> 01:25:16,159
minute i think the world would be a
 

5503
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:17,030
minute i think the world would be a
better

5504
01:25:17,030 --> 01:25:17,040
better
 

5505
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:19,030
better
place if there were more privacy coins

5506
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:19,040
place if there were more privacy coins
 

5507
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,629
place if there were more privacy coins
because it's kind of like the internet

5508
01:25:20,629 --> 01:25:20,639
because it's kind of like the internet
 

5509
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:22,470
because it's kind of like the internet
when it first came online like there was

5510
01:25:22,470 --> 01:25:22,480
when it first came online like there was
 

5511
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:25,590
when it first came online like there was
no https everything was http and there

5512
01:25:25,590 --> 01:25:25,600
no https everything was http and there
 

5513
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,270
no https everything was http and there
was you know so people were afraid to

5514
01:25:27,270 --> 01:25:27,280
was you know so people were afraid to
 

5515
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:28,709
was you know so people were afraid to
put their credit cards on the internet

5516
01:25:28,709 --> 01:25:28,719
put their credit cards on the internet
 

5517
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:30,950
put their credit cards on the internet
and um your your messages could be

5518
01:25:30,950 --> 01:25:30,960
and um your your messages could be
 

5519
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,149
and um your your messages could be
intercepted and all the stuff and now

5520
01:25:32,149 --> 01:25:32,159
intercepted and all the stuff and now
 

5521
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:33,430
intercepted and all the stuff and now
the whole internet has basically moved

5522
01:25:33,430 --> 01:25:33,440
the whole internet has basically moved
 

5523
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,510
the whole internet has basically moved
to https with a little lock icon in your

5524
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:35,520
to https with a little lock icon in your
 

5525
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:36,550
to https with a little lock icon in your
browser

5526
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:36,560

which is better like and and financial

5528
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:38,400
which is better like and and financial
 

5529
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,229
which is better like and and financial
information is like the most important

5530
01:25:40,229 --> 01:25:40,239
information is like the most important
 

5531
01:25:40,239 --> 01:25:42,550
information is like the most important
information to keep private right

5532
01:25:42,550 --> 01:25:42,560
information to keep private right
 

5533
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:44,709
information to keep private right
so there's times where let's say you're

5534
01:25:44,709 --> 01:25:44,719
so there's times where let's say you're
 

5535
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:46,149
so there's times where let's say you're
running a charity or something and you

5536
01:25:46,149 --> 01:25:46,159
running a charity or something and you
 

5537
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:47,830
running a charity or something and you
want to have total auditability

5538
01:25:47,830 --> 01:25:47,840
want to have total auditability
 

5539
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,750
want to have total auditability
transparency for the whole world who

5540
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:49,760
transparency for the whole world who
 

5541
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,189
transparency for the whole world who
donated and where did the money go

5542
01:25:51,189 --> 01:25:51,199
donated and where did the money go
 

5543
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:53,110
donated and where did the money go
that's great you want it to be public

5544
01:25:53,110 --> 01:25:53,120
that's great you want it to be public
 

5545
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:55,189
that's great you want it to be public
but if it's like your personal money or

5546
01:25:55,189 --> 01:25:55,199
but if it's like your personal money or
 

5547
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:56,629
but if it's like your personal money or
something like that you don't want to be

5548
01:25:56,629 --> 01:25:56,639
something like that you don't want to be
 

5549
01:25:56,639 --> 01:25:58,229
something like that you don't want to be
broadcasting that to the whole world and

5550
01:25:58,229 --> 01:25:58,239
broadcasting that to the whole world and
 

5551
01:25:58,239 --> 01:25:59,669
broadcasting that to the whole world and
in some ways that's what blockchains are

5552
01:25:59,669 --> 01:25:59,679
in some ways that's what blockchains are
 

5553
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:00,709
in some ways that's what blockchains are
doing

5554
01:26:00,709 --> 01:26:00,719
doing
 

5555
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:02,310
doing
you know pseudonymously because like but

5556
01:26:02,310 --> 01:26:02,320
you know pseudonymously because like but
 

5557
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,470
you know pseudonymously because like but
it is a public ledger and so if you can

5558
01:26:04,470 --> 01:26:04,480
it is a public ledger and so if you can
 

5559
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:05,910
it is a public ledger and so if you can
know who owns each address you can

5560
01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:05,920
know who owns each address you can
 

5561
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,669
know who owns each address you can
basically de-anonymize it

5562
01:26:07,669 --> 01:26:07,679
basically de-anonymize it
 

5563
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:10,870
basically de-anonymize it
i you know i think basically the people

5564
01:26:10,870 --> 01:26:10,880
i you know i think basically the people
 

5565
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:13,430
i you know i think basically the people
should fight for um privacy and freedoms

5566
01:26:13,430 --> 01:26:13,440
should fight for um privacy and freedoms
 

5567
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:15,510
should fight for um privacy and freedoms
of all kind but privacy of money is a

5568
01:26:15,510 --> 01:26:15,520
of all kind but privacy of money is a
 

5569
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:16,950
of all kind but privacy of money is a
good thing so i would like to see more

5570
01:26:16,950 --> 01:26:16,960
good thing so i would like to see more
 

5571
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:18,470
good thing so i would like to see more
of that in the future you chosen with

5572
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:18,480
of that in the future you chosen with
 

5573
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,550
of that in the future you chosen with
coinbase to

5574
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:20,560
coinbase to
 

5575
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:23,750
coinbase to
to uh to have a seat at the table with

5576
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:23,760
to uh to have a seat at the table with
 

5577
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:26,790
to uh to have a seat at the table with
the regulators yeah so what kind of

5578
01:26:26,790 --> 01:26:26,800
the regulators yeah so what kind of
 

5579
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:29,110
the regulators yeah so what kind of
what kind of conversations

5580
01:26:29,110 --> 01:26:29,120
what kind of conversations
 

5581
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,750
what kind of conversations
are there at that table what are the

5582
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:31,760
are there at that table what are the
 

5583
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:33,350
are there at that table what are the
regulations like

5584
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:33,360
regulations like
 

5585
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,350
regulations like
what is the level of understanding with

5586
01:26:35,350 --> 01:26:35,360
what is the level of understanding with
 

5587
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:36,709
what is the level of understanding with
regulators

5588
01:26:36,709 --> 01:26:36,719
regulators
 

5589
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:38,229
regulators
what are they worried about what are

5590
01:26:38,229 --> 01:26:38,239
what are they worried about what are
 

5591
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:39,590
what are they worried about what are
they thinking about what are the

5592
01:26:39,590 --> 01:26:39,600
they thinking about what are the
 

5593
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,990
they thinking about what are the
positive and what are the negative

5594
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:42,000
positive and what are the negative
 

5595
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,470
positive and what are the negative
regulations that you're facing

5596
01:26:44,470 --> 01:26:44,480
regulations that you're facing
 

5597
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,950
regulations that you're facing
that you're educating struggling with

5598
01:26:46,950 --> 01:26:46,960
that you're educating struggling with
 

5599
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:49,030
that you're educating struggling with
pushing back on supporting all that kind

5600
01:26:49,030 --> 01:26:49,040
pushing back on supporting all that kind
 

5601
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:51,030
pushing back on supporting all that kind
of stuff yeah

5602
01:26:51,030 --> 01:26:51,040
of stuff yeah
 

5603
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:52,950
of stuff yeah
oh man there's so many because we're i

5604
01:26:52,950 --> 01:26:52,960
oh man there's so many because we're i
 

5605
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:54,390
oh man there's so many because we're i
mean we're live in

5606
01:26:54,390 --> 01:26:54,400
mean we're live in
 

5607
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:55,189
mean we're live in
like

5608
01:26:55,189 --> 01:26:55,199
like
 

5609
01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:56,550
like
you know maybe 100 countries or more at

5610
01:26:56,550 --> 01:26:56,560
you know maybe 100 countries or more at
 

5611
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,149
you know maybe 100 countries or more at
this point so the the conversations are

5612
01:26:58,149 --> 01:26:58,159
this point so the the conversations are
 

5613
01:26:58,159 --> 01:26:59,350
this point so the the conversations are
all over the map

5614
01:26:59,350 --> 01:26:59,360
all over the map
 

5615
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:00,709
all over the map
um i'm trying to think what broad

5616
01:27:00,709 --> 01:27:00,719
um i'm trying to think what broad
 

5617
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:02,790
um i'm trying to think what broad
strokes i could paint for you so i'd say

5618
01:27:02,790 --> 01:27:02,800
strokes i could paint for you so i'd say
 

5619
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:05,910
strokes i could paint for you so i'd say
one trend that's that's positive is that

5620
01:27:05,910 --> 01:27:05,920
one trend that's that's positive is that
 

5621
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,350
one trend that's that's positive is that
basically regulators around the world

5622
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:07,360
basically regulators around the world
 

5623
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,270
basically regulators around the world
are con are more and more as over the

5624
01:27:09,270 --> 01:27:09,280
are con are more and more as over the
 

5625
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:11,350
are con are more and more as over the
last five years i would say

5626
01:27:11,350 --> 01:27:11,360
last five years i would say
 

5627
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,790
last five years i would say
it's more and more common to find a

5628
01:27:12,790 --> 01:27:12,800
it's more and more common to find a
 

5629
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,550
it's more and more common to find a
regulator today

5630
01:27:14,550 --> 01:27:14,560
regulator today
 

5631
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:15,669
regulator today
asking

5632
01:27:15,669 --> 01:27:15,679
asking
 

5633
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:17,189
asking
how can we preserve the innovation

5634
01:27:17,189 --> 01:27:17,199
how can we preserve the innovation
 

5635
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:19,110
how can we preserve the innovation
potential of this technology

5636
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:19,120
potential of this technology
 

5637
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:21,350
potential of this technology
while keeping the bad actors out than it

5638
01:27:21,350 --> 01:27:21,360
while keeping the bad actors out than it
 

5639
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:22,629
while keeping the bad actors out than it
was five years ago where they were

5640
01:27:22,629 --> 01:27:22,639
was five years ago where they were
 

5641
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:24,550
was five years ago where they were
saying this is all bad activity how do

5642
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:24,560
saying this is all bad activity how do
 

5643
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:25,830
saying this is all bad activity how do
we prevent it

5644
01:27:25,830 --> 01:27:25,840
we prevent it
 

5645
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:26,950
we prevent it
and so

5646
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:26,960
and so
 

5647
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:29,189
and so
um maybe this is when you say more and

5648
01:27:29,189 --> 01:27:29,199
um maybe this is when you say more and
 

5649
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:31,189
um maybe this is when you say more and
more

5650
01:27:31,189 --> 01:27:31,199
more
 

5651
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:32,150
more
what fraction

5652
01:27:32,150 --> 01:27:32,160
what fraction
 

5653
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:34,229
what fraction
[Laughter]

5654
01:27:34,229 --> 01:27:34,239
[Laughter]
 

5655
01:27:34,239 --> 01:27:35,830
[Laughter]
i'll give you like a u.s specific

5656
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:35,840
i'll give you like a u.s specific
 

5657
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:37,669
i'll give you like a u.s specific
example although we operate in many

5658
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:37,679
example although we operate in many
 

5659
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:40,550
example although we operate in many
countries so when i go to dc now i would

5660
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:40,560
countries so when i go to dc now i would
 

5661
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,070
countries so when i go to dc now i would
say

5662
01:27:42,070 --> 01:27:42,080
say
 

5663
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:44,470
say
you know 50 60 of the people who i meet

5664
01:27:44,470 --> 01:27:44,480
you know 50 60 of the people who i meet
 

5665
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:46,470
you know 50 60 of the people who i meet
with are basically

5666
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:46,480
with are basically
 

5667
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:48,870
with are basically
you know they're in the camp of crypto

5668
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:48,880
you know they're in the camp of crypto
 

5669
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,470
you know they're in the camp of crypto
has a lot of potential we should

5670
01:27:50,470 --> 01:27:50,480
has a lot of potential we should
 

5671
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:52,149
has a lot of potential we should
regulate it to make sure the bad people

5672
01:27:52,149 --> 01:27:52,159
regulate it to make sure the bad people
 

5673
01:27:52,159 --> 01:27:53,910
regulate it to make sure the bad people
don't do something bad with it but this

5674
01:27:53,910 --> 01:27:53,920
don't do something bad with it but this
 

5675
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:55,510
don't do something bad with it but this
is here to stay and it has a lot of

5676
01:27:55,510 --> 01:27:55,520
is here to stay and it has a lot of
 

5677
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,510
is here to stay and it has a lot of
upside we should basically

5678
01:27:57,510 --> 01:27:57,520
upside we should basically
 

5679
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,990
upside we should basically
um create thoughtful regulation and

5680
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:00,000
um create thoughtful regulation and
 

5681
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,510
um create thoughtful regulation and
celebrate it and actually encourage this

5682
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:01,520
celebrate it and actually encourage this
 

5683
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:04,149
celebrate it and actually encourage this
innovation to happen in the u.s that's

5684
01:28:04,149 --> 01:28:04,159
innovation to happen in the u.s that's
 

5685
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:06,390
innovation to happen in the u.s that's
a huge change from just three years ago

5686
01:28:06,390 --> 01:28:06,400
a huge change from just three years ago
 

5687
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,910
a huge change from just three years ago
where it was probably 30 of people

5688
01:28:07,910 --> 01:28:07,920
where it was probably 30 of people
 

5689
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:09,270
where it was probably 30 of people
saying that now it's like 60. it's like

5690
01:28:09,270 --> 01:28:09,280
saying that now it's like 60. it's like
 

5691
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:11,270
saying that now it's like 60. it's like
almost double it's getting harder to

5692
01:28:11,270 --> 01:28:11,280
almost double it's getting harder to
 

5693
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:15,189
almost double it's getting harder to
find like true cryptoskeptics in dc

5694
01:28:15,189 --> 01:28:15,199
find like true cryptoskeptics in dc
 

5695
01:28:15,199 --> 01:28:17,110
find like true cryptoskeptics in dc
um i'd say that you know

5696
01:28:17,110 --> 01:28:17,120
um i'd say that you know
 

5697
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:19,430
um i'd say that you know
maybe maybe only like 20 or 30 of people

5698
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:19,440
maybe maybe only like 20 or 30 of people
 

5699
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:21,110
maybe maybe only like 20 or 30 of people
are like willing to say something

5700
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:21,120
are like willing to say something
 

5701
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:22,790
are like willing to say something
negative like they actually think it's

5702
01:28:22,790 --> 01:28:22,800
negative like they actually think it's
 

5703
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,390
negative like they actually think it's
net negative it's like it's really hard

5704
01:28:24,390 --> 01:28:24,400
net negative it's like it's really hard
 

5705
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:25,990
net negative it's like it's really hard
to defend that position at this point

5706
01:28:25,990 --> 01:28:26,000
to defend that position at this point
 

5707
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,189
to defend that position at this point
because

5708
01:28:27,189 --> 01:28:27,199
because
 

5709
01:28:27,199 --> 01:28:28,629
because
almost like one in five americans have

5710
01:28:28,629 --> 01:28:28,639
almost like one in five americans have
 

5711
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:30,070
almost like one in five americans have
used or tried crypto at this point so

5712
01:28:30,070 --> 01:28:30,080
used or tried crypto at this point so
 

5713
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:32,070
used or tried crypto at this point so
you're kind of condemning 20 of your

5714
01:28:32,070 --> 01:28:32,080
you're kind of condemning 20 of your
 

5715
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:33,590
you're kind of condemning 20 of your
fellow citizens if you say that at this

5716
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:33,600
fellow citizens if you say that at this
 

5717
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:34,390
fellow citizens if you say that at this
point

5718

01:30:53,350 --> 01:30:53,360
fraud and the scams we all want to get
 

5881
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,310
fraud and the scams we all want to get
rid of that

5882
01:30:54,310 --> 01:30:54,320
rid of that
 

5883
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:57,510
rid of that
so let's create a relatively simple test

5884
01:30:57,510 --> 01:30:57,520
so let's create a relatively simple test
 

5885
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:58,709
so let's create a relatively simple test
which says

5886
01:30:58,709 --> 01:30:58,719
which says
 

5887
01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:01,110
which says
you know if it's like

5888
01:31:01,110 --> 01:31:01,120
you know if it's like
 

5889
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:02,790
you know if it's like
nobody controls more than 20 of it or

5890
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:02,800
nobody controls more than 20 of it or
 

5891
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:04,390
nobody controls more than 20 of it or
some threshold it probably is more like

5892
01:31:04,390 --> 01:31:04,400
some threshold it probably is more like
 

5893
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:06,950
some threshold it probably is more like
a commodity if someone's raising money

5894
01:31:06,950 --> 01:31:06,960
a commodity if someone's raising money
 

5895
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:09,350
a commodity if someone's raising money
for they're selling this thing for a

5896
01:31:09,350 --> 01:31:09,360
for they're selling this thing for a
 

5897
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:10,950
for they're selling this thing for a
business then it's probably a security

5898
01:31:10,950 --> 01:31:10,960
business then it's probably a security
 

5899
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:13,350
business then it's probably a security
and then you know if it's more like a

5900
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:13,360
and then you know if it's more like a
 

5901
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:15,030
and then you know if it's more like a
medium of exchange it's a currency and

5902
01:31:15,030 --> 01:31:15,040
medium of exchange it's a currency and
 

5903
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,470
medium of exchange it's a currency and
if it's none of those things maybe it's

5904
01:31:16,470 --> 01:31:16,480
if it's none of those things maybe it's
 

5905
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:18,070
if it's none of those things maybe it's
artwork or whatever

5906
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:18,080
artwork or whatever
 

5907
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:20,149
artwork or whatever
a legal test like that would help

5908
01:31:20,149 --> 01:31:20,159
a legal test like that would help
 

5909
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:22,070
a legal test like that would help
clarify who which regulator is

5910
01:31:22,070 --> 01:31:22,080
clarify who which regulator is
 

5911
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,430
clarify who which regulator is
regulating what

5912
01:31:23,430 --> 01:31:23,440
regulating what
 

5913
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:25,430
regulating what
and then um you know we also want to

5914
01:31:25,430 --> 01:31:25,440
and then um you know we also want to
 

5915
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:27,030
and then um you know we also want to
have probably like a sandbox for

5916
01:31:27,030 --> 01:31:27,040
have probably like a sandbox for
 

5917
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:29,110
have probably like a sandbox for
innovation where if you're a startup and

5918
01:31:29,110 --> 01:31:29,120
innovation where if you're a startup and
 

5919
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:30,950
innovation where if you're a startup and
you're doing less than i don't know some

5920
01:31:30,950 --> 01:31:30,960
you're doing less than i don't know some
 

5921
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:31,830
you're doing less than i don't know some
number

5922
01:31:31,830 --> 01:31:31,840
number
 

5923
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,189
number
um

5924
01:31:33,189 --> 01:31:33,199
um
 

5925
01:31:33,199 --> 01:31:34,790
um
less than some amount of payment volume

5926
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:34,800
less than some amount of payment volume
 

5927
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,470
less than some amount of payment volume
or customer funds you're storing it's

5928
01:31:36,470 --> 01:31:36,480
or customer funds you're storing it's
 

5929
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,310
or customer funds you're storing it's
like just let those things get off the

5930
01:31:38,310 --> 01:31:38,320
like just let those things get off the
 

5931
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:39,750
like just let those things get off the
ground without

5932
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:39,760
ground without
 

5933
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,430
ground without
a soul-crushing amount of legal bills

5934
01:31:41,430 --> 01:31:41,440
a soul-crushing amount of legal bills
 

5935
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:44,629
a soul-crushing amount of legal bills
you know and uncertainty so if the u.s

5936
01:31:44,629 --> 01:31:44,639
you know and uncertainty so if the u.s
 

5937
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:45,990
you know and uncertainty so if the u.s
can get there that would be great i

5938
01:31:45,990 --> 01:31:46,000
can get there that would be great i
 

5939
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,510
can get there that would be great i
think a bunch of other countries now are

5940
01:31:47,510 --> 01:31:47,520
think a bunch of other countries now are
 

5941
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:49,110
think a bunch of other countries now are
rushing around the world to sort of

5942
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:49,120
rushing around the world to sort of
 

5943
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,709
rushing around the world to sort of
create that regulation that it does

5944
01:31:50,709 --> 01:31:50,719
create that regulation that it does
 

5945
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:52,390

i hope that coinbase and a bunch of
 

5957
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:02,550
i hope that coinbase and a bunch of
other crypto companies can help in that

5958
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:02,560
other crypto companies can help in that
 

5959

conversation too we have a whole policy
effort i think actually crypto policy

5962
01:32:06,629 --> 01:32:06,639
effort i think actually crypto policy
 

5963
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:07,750
effort i think actually crypto policy
efforts are like probably one of the

5964
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:07,760
efforts are like probably one of the
 

5965
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:09,990
efforts are like probably one of the
biggest things in dc right now so

5966
01:32:09,990 --> 01:32:10,000
biggest things in dc right now so
 

5967
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:10,870
biggest things in dc right now so
um

5968

um
it moves it moves slow at the speed of

5970
01:32:12,790 --> 01:32:12,800
it moves it moves slow at the speed of
 

5971
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:15,189
it moves it moves slow at the speed of
government but um

5972
01:32:15,189 --> 01:32:15,199
government but um
 

5973

what is supposed to make sense of nfts
 

5995
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:39,110
what is supposed to make sense of nfts
what is nfts exactly from a perspective

5996
01:32:39,110 --> 01:32:39,120
what is nfts exactly from a perspective
 

5997
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:41,030
what is nfts exactly from a perspective
of a regulator

5998

it'll be very interesting to see where
nfts go over time it could get

6048
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:28,880
nfts go over time it could get
 

6049
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:29,990
nfts go over time it could get
that's and that's the danger you don't

6050
01:33:29,990 --> 01:33:30,000
that's and that's the danger you don't
 

6051
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,030
that's and that's the danger you don't
want to try to like define the

and uh
that's part of like innovating in a

6096
01:34:07,669 --> 01:34:07,679
that's part of like innovating in a
 

6097
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:09,830
that's part of like innovating in a
regulated field which is you know whole

6098
01:34:09,830 --> 01:34:09,840
regulated field which is you know whole
 

6099
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:12,709
regulated field which is you know whole
topic in itself so if you are

6100
01:34:12,709 --> 01:34:12,719
topic in itself so if you are
 

6101
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:14,709
topic in itself so if you are
at the table i mean

6102
01:34:14,709 --> 01:34:14,719
at the table i mean
 

6103
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:16,870
at the table i mean
this is less the case in the united

passed on to the the customer in higher
fees so

6224
01:36:15,910 --> 01:36:15,920
fees so
 

6225
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:17,430
fees so
you have to employ armies of lawyers to

6226
01:36:17,430 --> 01:36:17,440
you have to employ armies of lawyers to
 

6227
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:19,109
you have to employ armies of lawyers to
deal with this stuff can you educate me

6228
01:36:19,109 --> 01:36:19,119
deal with this stuff can you educate me
 

6229
01:36:19,119 --> 01:36:21,430
deal with this stuff can you educate me
on something how much innovation

6230
01:36:21,430 --> 01:36:21,440
on something how much innovation
 

6231
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:23,669
on something how much innovation
is there in the legal space

6232
01:36:23,669 --> 01:36:23,679
is there in the legal space
 

6233
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:26,229
is there in the legal space
so for lawyers working with coinbase

6234
01:36:26,229 --> 01:36:26,239
so for lawyers working with coinbase
 

6235
01:36:26,239 --> 01:36:28,470
so for lawyers working with coinbase
because it's such a new

6236
01:36:28,470 --> 01:36:28,480
because it's such a new
 

6237
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:30,629
because it's such a new
cutting-edge thing

6238
01:36:30,629 --> 01:36:30,639
cutting-edge thing
 

6239
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:31,910
cutting-edge thing
so you're

6240
01:36:31,910 --> 01:36:31,920
so you're
 

6241
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:33,669
so you're
if there's a lot of gray area you're

6242
01:36:33,669 --> 01:36:33,679
if there's a lot of gray area you're
 

6243
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:35,910
if there's a lot of gray area you're
supposed to be operating

6244
01:36:35,910 --> 01:36:35,920
supposed to be operating
 

6245
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:38,229
supposed to be operating
under like how hard is is it being a

6246
01:36:38,229 --> 01:36:38,239
under like how hard is is it being a
 

6247
01:36:38,239 --> 01:36:40,950
under like how hard is is it being a
lawyer at coinbase

6248
01:36:40,950 --> 01:36:40,960
lawyer at coinbase
 

6249
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:43,350
lawyer at coinbase
like uh how much precedence is there i

6250
01:36:43,350 --> 01:36:43,360
like uh how much precedence is there i
 

6251
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:45,030
like uh how much precedence is there i
guess is what i'm asking i mean just

6252
01:36:45,030 --> 01:36:45,040
guess is what i'm asking i mean just
 

6253
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:47,910
guess is what i'm asking i mean just
like you said three years

6254
01:36:47,910 --> 01:36:47,920
like you said three years
 

6255
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:50,550
like you said three years
it's kind of a new space yeah well it's

6256
01:36:50,550 --> 01:36:50,560
it's kind of a new space yeah well it's
 

6257
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:52,550
it's kind of a new space yeah well it's
probably very hard to be alert coinbase

6258
01:36:52,550 --> 01:36:52,560
probably very hard to be alert coinbase
 

6259
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:54,390
probably very hard to be alert coinbase
and very fun because

6260
01:36:54,390 --> 01:36:54,400
and very fun because
 

6261
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:55,990
and very fun because
you know whenever you're in a new field

6262
01:36:55,990 --> 01:36:56,000
you know whenever you're in a new field
 

6263
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,790
you know whenever you're in a new field
that's growing fast there isn't a lot of

6264

that's growing fast there isn't a lot of
 

6265
01:36:58,800 --> 01:36:59,669
that's growing fast there isn't a lot of
um

6266
01:36:59,669 --> 01:36:59,679

6273
01:37:06,159 --> 01:37:08,229
create that stuff and that's what a lot
of legal careers are made out of is like

6274
01:37:08,229 --> 01:37:08,239
of legal careers are made out of is like
 

6275
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:09,830
of legal careers are made out of is like
take a complex situation where you have

6276
01:37:09,830 --> 01:37:09,840
take a complex situation where you have
 

6277
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:11,750
take a complex situation where you have
to balance difficult things like how do

6278
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:11,760
to balance difficult things like how do
 

6279
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:13,510

we prevent bad activity but still enable

6280
01:37:13,510 --> 01:37:13,520
we prevent bad activity but still enable
 

6281
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:15,750
we prevent bad activity but still enable
an innovation that's a hard question

6282
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:15,760
an innovation that's a hard question
 

6283
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:18,310
an innovation that's a hard question
and there's you can go draft legislation

6284
01:37:18,310 --> 01:37:18,320
and there's you can go draft legislation
 

6285
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:19,590
and there's you can go draft legislation
and circulate it to policy policymakers

6286

6304
01:37:35,669 --> 01:37:35,679
yeah a lot of our lawyers have to come
 

6305
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:37,750
yeah a lot of our lawyers have to come
up with that very creative stuff you

6306
01:37:37,750 --> 01:37:37,760
up with that very creative stuff you
 

6307
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:38,870
up with that very creative stuff you
mentioned one of the things you're

6308
01:37:38,870 --> 01:37:38,880
mentioned one of the things you're

focused on is expanding the number of
 

6311
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:43,189
focused on is expanding the number of
people maybe a billion people

6312
01:37:43,189 --> 01:37:43,199
people maybe a billion people
 

6313
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:46,229
people maybe a billion people
on coinbase or using cryptocurrency

6314
01:37:46,229 --> 01:37:46,239
on coinbase or using cryptocurrency
 

6315
01:37:46,239 --> 01:37:47,750
on coinbase or using cryptocurrency
where are we at now how did we get to a

6316
01:37:47,750 --> 01:37:47,760
where are we at now how did we get to a
 

6317
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:48,870
where are we at now how did we get to a
billion

6318
01:37:48,870 --> 01:37:48,880
billion
 

6319
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:51,830
billion
as of q4 last year we had 89 million

6320
01:37:51,830 --> 01:37:51,840
as of q4 last year we had 89 million
 

6321
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:54,149
as of q4 last year we had 89 million
verified accounts on coinbase but in any

6322
01:37:54,149 --> 01:37:54,159
verified accounts on coinbase but in any
 

6323
01:37:54,159 --> 01:37:55,510
verified accounts on coinbase but in any
given

6324
01:37:55,510 --> 01:37:55,520
given
 

6325
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:58,229
given
uh quarter only you know maybe

6326
01:37:58,229 --> 01:37:58,239
uh quarter only you know maybe
 

6327
01:37:58,239 --> 01:37:59,830
uh quarter only you know maybe
like 10 or a little more million of

6328
01:37:59,830 --> 01:37:59,840
like 10 or a little more million of
 

6329
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:02,870
like 10 or a little more million of
those are like really active so

6330
01:38:02,870 --> 01:38:02,880
those are like really active so
 

6331
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:04,870
those are like really active so
um and then if you look at globally i

6332
01:38:04,870 --> 01:38:04,880
um and then if you look at globally i
 

6333
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:06,229
um and then if you look at globally i
think some of the estimates i've seen is

6334
01:38:06,229 --> 01:38:06,239
think some of the estimates i've seen is
 

6335
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:08,470
think some of the estimates i've seen is
maybe there's like 200 million people or

6336
01:38:08,470 --> 01:38:08,480
maybe there's like 200 million people or
 

6337
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:09,910
maybe there's like 200 million people or
something like that who have ever used

6338
01:38:09,910 --> 01:38:09,920
something like that who have ever used
 

6339
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:11,510
something like that who have ever used
or tried crypto

6340
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:11,520
or tried crypto
 

6341
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:13,189
or tried crypto
so

6342
01:38:13,189 --> 01:38:13,199
so
 

6343
01:38:13,199 --> 01:38:14,709
so
we're along you know

6344
01:38:14,709 --> 01:38:14,719
we're along you know
 

6345
01:38:14,719 --> 01:38:16,390
we're along you know
ways from a billion but it's not like

6346
01:38:16,390 --> 01:38:16,400
ways from a billion but it's not like
 

6347
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:17,910
ways from a billion but it's not like
that far off

6348
01:38:17,910 --> 01:38:17,920
that far off
 

6349
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:19,750
that far off
um how do you get there

6350
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:19,760
um how do you get there
 

6351
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,270
um how do you get there
yeah

6352
01:38:21,270 --> 01:38:21,280
yeah
 

6353
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:23,189
yeah
so a few things one is the blockchains

6354
01:38:23,189 --> 01:38:23,199
so a few things one is the blockchains
 

6355
01:38:23,199 --> 01:38:25,350
so a few things one is the blockchains
have got to become way more scalable

6356
01:38:25,350 --> 01:38:25,360
have got to become way more scalable
 

6357
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:27,030
have got to become way more scalable
um it's kind of like we're all running

6358
01:38:27,030 --> 01:38:27,040
um it's kind of like we're all running
 

6359
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:29,109
um it's kind of like we're all running
dial-up modems and we need broadband and

6360
01:38:29,109 --> 01:38:29,119
dial-up modems and we need broadband and
 

6361
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:31,030
dial-up modems and we need broadband and
so it's just like

6362
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:31,040
so it's just like
 

6363
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,470
so it's just like
too expensive too slow to do all these

6364
01:38:32,470 --> 01:38:32,480
too expensive too slow to do all these
 

6365
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:33,990
too expensive too slow to do all these
transactions and i think

6366
01:38:33,990 --> 01:38:34,000
transactions and i think
 

6367
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,870
transactions and i think
if we just get l2s working and

6368
01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:36,880
if we just get l2s working and
 

6369
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:38,790
if we just get l2s working and
scalability you know we'll see another

6370
01:38:38,790 --> 01:38:38,800
scalability you know we'll see another
 

6371
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,870
scalability you know we'll see another
order of magnitude kind of come out just

6372
01:38:40,870 --> 01:38:40,880
order of magnitude kind of come out just
 

6373
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:42,229
order of magnitude kind of come out just
from that

6374
01:38:42,229 --> 01:38:42,239
from that
 

6375
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:44,070
from that
um i think the second one be more clear

6376
01:38:44,070 --> 01:38:44,080
um i think the second one be more clear
 

6377
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:46,709
um i think the second one be more clear
regulation that would help a lot um

6378
01:38:46,709 --> 01:38:46,719
regulation that would help a lot um
 

6379
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:49,750
regulation that would help a lot um
i do talk to you know pension funds and

6389
01:38:56,159 --> 01:38:57,750
a lot of them tell me we've we've got
one percent of our portfolio in crypto

6390
01:38:57,750 --> 01:38:57,760
one percent of our portfolio in crypto
 

6391
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:58,790
one percent of our portfolio in crypto
today

6392
01:38:58,790 --> 01:38:58,800
today
 

6393
01:38:58,800 --> 01:38:59,830
today
but

6394
01:38:59,830 --> 01:38:59,840
but
 

6395
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:01,830
but
we really would rather have like 20 in

6396
01:39:01,830 --> 01:39:01,840
we really would rather have like 20 in
 

6397
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:04,470
we really would rather have like 20 in
there but what we're waiting for is

6398
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:04,480
there but what we're waiting for is
 

6399
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:07,030
there but what we're waiting for is
more clear regulation um coming out and

6400
01:39:07,030 --> 01:39:07,040
more clear regulation um coming out and
 

6401
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:08,709
more clear regulation um coming out and
saying that clear test that i was saying

6402
01:39:08,709 --> 01:39:08,719
saying that clear test that i was saying
 

6403
01:39:08,719 --> 01:39:10,229
saying that clear test that i was saying
these assets are commodities regulated

6404
01:39:10,229 --> 01:39:10,239
these assets are commodities regulated
 

6405
01:39:10,239 --> 01:39:11,910
these assets are commodities regulated
by so if you see these are my sec these

6406
01:39:11,910 --> 01:39:11,920
by so if you see these are my sec these
 

6407
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:13,590
by so if you see these are my sec these
are about treasury whatever

6408
01:39:13,590 --> 01:39:13,600
are about treasury whatever
 

6409
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:15,350
are about treasury whatever
so that would be a big unlock

6410
01:39:15,350 --> 01:39:15,360
so that would be a big unlock
 

6411
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:17,750
so that would be a big unlock
do transactions so one of the things

6412
01:39:17,750 --> 01:39:17,760
do transactions so one of the things
 

6413
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:20,790
do transactions so one of the things
that you mentioned uh payments sorry

6414
01:39:20,790 --> 01:39:20,800
that you mentioned uh payments sorry
 

6415
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:23,030
that you mentioned uh payments sorry
yeah well does that unlock a lot of

6416
01:39:23,030 --> 01:39:23,040
yeah well does that unlock a lot of
 

6417
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:25,109
yeah well does that unlock a lot of
users

6418
01:39:25,109 --> 01:39:25,119
users
 

6419
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:27,590
users
yeah it does i mean remittance is like a

6420
01:39:27,590 --> 01:39:27,600
yeah it does i mean remittance is like a
 

6421
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:29,350
yeah it does i mean remittance is like a
huge thing people sending money home to

6422
01:39:29,350 --> 01:39:29,360
huge thing people sending money home to
 

6423
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:31,270
huge thing people sending money home to
their families in other countries where

6424
01:39:31,270 --> 01:39:31,280
their families in other countries where
 

6425
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:33,910
their families in other countries where
the fees are super high so yeah if we

6426
01:39:33,910 --> 01:39:33,920
the fees are super high so yeah if we
 

6427
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:35,590
the fees are super high so yeah if we
get blockchains to be more scalable and

6428
01:39:35,590 --> 01:39:35,600
get blockchains to be more scalable and
 

6429
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:37,109
get blockchains to be more scalable and
there's more global adoption like i

6430
01:39:37,109 --> 01:39:37,119
there's more global adoption like i
 

6431
01:39:37,119 --> 01:39:38,390
there's more global adoption like i
think we'll see

6432
01:39:38,390 --> 01:39:38,400
think we'll see
 

6433
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:40,629
think we'll see
remittance quarters um move over to

6434
01:39:40,629 --> 01:39:40,639
remittance quarters um move over to
 

6435
01:39:40,639 --> 01:39:42,149
remittance quarters um move over to
crypto a lot

6436
01:39:42,149 --> 01:39:42,159
crypto a lot
 

6437
01:39:42,159 --> 01:39:43,830
crypto a lot
there's also just um the other thing

6438
01:39:43,830 --> 01:39:43,840
there's also just um the other thing
 

6439
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:45,270
there's also just um the other thing
that's driving a lot of crypto adoption

6440
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:45,280
that's driving a lot of crypto adoption
 

6441
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,550
that's driving a lot of crypto adoption
is basically

6442
01:39:46,550 --> 01:39:46,560
is basically
 

6443
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,669
is basically
the creation of more and more

6444
01:39:47,669 --> 01:39:47,679
the creation of more and more
 

6445
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:50,310
the creation of more and more
third-party apps so or adapts they're

6446
01:39:50,310 --> 01:39:50,320
third-party apps so or adapts they're
 

6447
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:52,629
third-party apps so or adapts they're
sometimes called decentralized apps so a

6448
01:39:52,629 --> 01:39:52,639
sometimes called decentralized apps so a
 

6449
01:39:52,639 --> 01:39:54,950
sometimes called decentralized apps so a
lot of startups now um

6450
01:39:54,950 --> 01:39:54,960
lot of startups now um
 

6451
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:56,470
lot of startups now um
you know how like you used to use in the

6452
01:39:56,470 --> 01:39:56,480
you know how like you used to use in the
 

6453
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:58,070
you know how like you used to use in the
early 2000s they called them.com

6454
01:39:58,070 --> 01:39:58,080
early 2000s they called them.com
 

6455
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:59,270
early 2000s they called them.com
startups but now you don't need to

6456
01:39:59,270 --> 01:39:59,280
startups but now you don't need to
 

6457
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:00,629
startups but now you don't need to
say.com because everybody's using the

6458
01:40:00,629 --> 01:40:00,639
say.com because everybody's using the
 

6459
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:03,430
say.com because everybody's using the
internet and so now there's like

6460
01:40:03,430 --> 01:40:03,440
internet and so now there's like
 

6461
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:04,790
internet and so now there's like
hundreds or thousands of these crypto

6462
01:40:04,790 --> 01:40:04,800
hundreds or thousands of these crypto
 

6463
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:05,990
hundreds or thousands of these crypto
startups

6464
01:40:05,990 --> 01:40:06,000
startups
 

6465
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,109
startups
but i think in the future you won't need

6466
01:40:07,109 --> 01:40:07,119
but i think in the future you won't need
 

6467
01:40:07,119 --> 01:40:08,149
but i think in the future you won't need
to call them crypto startups because

6468
01:40:08,149 --> 01:40:08,159
to call them crypto startups because
 

6469
01:40:08,159 --> 01:40:09,350
to call them crypto startups because
they'll just be called startups because

6470
01:40:09,350 --> 01:40:09,360
they'll just be called startups because
 

6471
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:10,790
they'll just be called startups because
everyone's using the internet and crypto

6472
01:40:10,790 --> 01:40:10,800
everyone's using the internet and crypto
 

6473
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,950
everyone's using the internet and crypto
and whatever so

6474
01:40:12,950 --> 01:40:12,960
and whatever so
 

6475
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:15,270
and whatever so
anyway the the the use cases the utility

6476
01:40:15,270 --> 01:40:15,280
anyway the the the use cases the utility
 

6477
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:16,709
anyway the the the use cases the utility
of crypto is is getting better and

6478
01:40:16,709 --> 01:40:16,719
of crypto is is getting better and
 

6479
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:18,629
of crypto is is getting better and
better with like all these third-party

6480
01:40:18,629 --> 01:40:18,639
better with like all these third-party
 

6481
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:20,390
better with like all these third-party
apps getting funded and created and do

6482
01:40:20,390 --> 01:40:20,400
apps getting funded and created and do
 

6483
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:22,470
apps getting funded and created and do
you think there's gonna be a killer

6484
01:40:22,470 --> 01:40:22,480
you think there's gonna be a killer
 

6485
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:24,790
you think there's gonna be a killer
or a set of killer daps

6486
01:40:24,790 --> 01:40:24,800
or a set of killer daps
 

6487
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:26,629
or a set of killer daps
like a thing where nobody can live

6488
01:40:26,629 --> 01:40:26,639
like a thing where nobody can live
 

6489
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:29,109
like a thing where nobody can live
without are we still waiting for that

6490
01:40:29,109 --> 01:40:29,119
without are we still waiting for that
 

6491
01:40:29,119 --> 01:40:30,229
without are we still waiting for that
there's gonna be a bunch of them it's

6492
01:40:30,229 --> 01:40:30,239
there's gonna be a bunch of them it's
 

6493
01:40:30,239 --> 01:40:31,990
there's gonna be a bunch of them it's
just like it's like the internet like

6494
01:40:31,990 --> 01:40:32,000
just like it's like the internet like
 

6495
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,669
just like it's like the internet like
what were the killer web companies you

6496
01:40:33,669 --> 01:40:33,679
what were the killer web companies you
 

6497
01:40:33,679 --> 01:40:36,470
what were the killer web companies you
know like uber and wikipedia and airbnb

6498
01:40:36,470 --> 01:40:36,480
know like uber and wikipedia and airbnb
 

6499
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,149
know like uber and wikipedia and airbnb
and google and like

6500
01:40:38,149 --> 01:40:38,159
and google and like
 

6501
01:40:38,159 --> 01:40:39,030
and google and like
so

6502
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:39,040
so
 

6503
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:40,390
so
there's going to be some big winners but

6504
01:40:40,390 --> 01:40:40,400
there's going to be some big winners but
 

6505
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:42,950
there's going to be some big winners but
there'll be thousands of this is

6506
01:40:42,950 --> 01:40:42,960
there'll be thousands of this is
 

6507
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:44,870
there'll be thousands of this is
basically the new

6508
01:40:44,870 --> 01:40:44,880
basically the new
 

6509
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:46,310
basically the new
it's like what happened with the dot-com

6510
01:40:46,310 --> 01:40:46,320
it's like what happened with the dot-com
 

6511
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:47,990
it's like what happened with the dot-com
startups in the early 2000s it's like a

6512
01:40:47,990 --> 01:40:48,000
startups in the early 2000s it's like a
 

6513
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,109
startups in the early 2000s it's like a

so
the u.s by some measures is kind of

6572
01:41:43,590 --> 01:41:43,600
the u.s by some measures is kind of
 

6573
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:46,149
the u.s by some measures is kind of
looks like it's maybe it's had a really

6574
01:41:46,149 --> 01:41:46,159
looks like it's maybe it's had a really
 

6575
01:41:46,159 --> 01:41:47,510
looks like it's maybe it's had a really
good run and it's coming down a little

6576
01:41:47,510 --> 01:41:47,520
good run and it's coming down a little
 

6577
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:49,109
good run and it's coming down a little
bit and china is kind of kind of coming

6578
01:41:49,109 --> 01:41:49,119
bit and china is kind of kind of coming
 

6579
01:41:49,119 --> 01:41:50,870
bit and china is kind of kind of coming
up who knows how that'll play out by the

6580
01:41:50,870 --> 01:41:50,880
up who knows how that'll play out by the
 

6581
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,390
up who knows how that'll play out by the
way like the world is very complicated

6582
01:41:52,390 --> 01:41:52,400
way like the world is very complicated
 

6583
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:54,629
way like the world is very complicated
it could that could switch

6584
01:41:54,629 --> 01:41:54,639
it could that could switch
 

6585
01:41:54,639 --> 01:41:55,430
it could that could switch
um

6586
01:41:55,430 --> 01:41:55,440
um
 

6587
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:57,270
um
but i guess

6588
01:41:57,270 --> 01:41:57,280
but i guess
 

6589
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:59,109
but i guess
if the u.s dollar is going to be seeing

6590
01:41:59,109 --> 01:41:59,119
if the u.s dollar is going to be seeing
 

6591
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:01,830
if the u.s dollar is going to be seeing
more inflation in the future

6592
01:42:01,830 --> 01:42:01,840
more inflation in the future
 

6593
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:04,229
more inflation in the future
the chinese yuan is not like

6594
01:42:04,229 --> 01:42:04,239
the chinese yuan is not like
 

6595
01:42:04,239 --> 01:42:06,790
the chinese yuan is not like
necessarily better right i mean

6596
01:42:06,790 --> 01:42:06,800
necessarily better right i mean
 

6597
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:10,149
necessarily better right i mean
they have a ton of debt as well and um

6598
01:42:10,149 --> 01:42:10,159
they have a ton of debt as well and um
 

6599
01:42:10,159 --> 01:42:12,149
they have a ton of debt as well and um
you know it's not like

6600
01:42:12,149 --> 01:42:12,159
you know it's not like
 

6601
01:42:12,159 --> 01:42:14,149
you know it's not like
you could really that that the yuan

6602
01:42:14,149 --> 01:42:14,159
you could really that that the yuan
 

6603
01:42:14,159 --> 01:42:15,590
you could really that that the yuan
could be inflated as well right i

6604
01:42:15,590 --> 01:42:15,600
could be inflated as well right i
 

6605
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:17,990
could be inflated as well right i
probably will be and so i do think that

6606
01:42:17,990 --> 01:42:18,000
probably will be and so i do think that
 

6607
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,390
probably will be and so i do think that
there's this group of people today which

6608
01:42:20,390 --> 01:42:20,400
there's this group of people today which
 

6609
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:23,750
there's this group of people today which
probably most traditional um

6610
01:42:23,750 --> 01:42:23,760
probably most traditional um
 

6611
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:26,310
probably most traditional um
i don't know like the people

6612

6617
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:30,229
and stuff that they're not this is not
really on their radar today but i think

6618
01:42:30,229 --> 01:42:30,239
really on their radar today but i think
 

6619
01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:31,990
really on their radar today but i think
there's there's a basically a group of

younger people in that kind of
 

6623
01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:36,070
younger people in that kind of
you know 25 35 year old range who are

that last minute it's like if i if i go
 

6643
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:52,709

so this segment of the population is not

6652
01:42:59,270 --> 01:42:59,280
so this segment of the population is not
 

6653
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:00,390
so this segment of the population is not
like

6654
01:43:00,390 --> 01:43:00,400
like
 

6655
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:03,270
like
massive yet from a gdp point of view but

6656
01:43:03,270 --> 01:43:03,280
massive yet from a gdp point of view but
 

6657
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:05,430
massive yet from a gdp point of view but
um i think it's a leading indicator of

6658
01:43:05,430 --> 01:43:05,440
um i think it's a leading indicator of
 

6659
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:06,950
um i think it's a leading indicator of
where things could be going and this is

6660
01:43:06,950 --> 01:43:06,960
where things could be going and this is
 

6661
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:08,149
where things could be going and this is
actually good for the world it's kind of

6662
01:43:08,149 --> 01:43:08,159
actually good for the world it's kind of
 

6663
01:43:08,159 --> 01:43:09,350
actually good for the world it's kind of
like

6664
01:43:09,350 --> 01:43:09,360
like
 

6665
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:10,870
like
especially if china does continue to

6666
01:43:10,870 --> 01:43:10,880
especially if china does continue to
 

6667
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:13,109
especially if china does continue to
rise and it has a more authoritarian

6668
01:43:13,109 --> 01:43:13,119
rise and it has a more authoritarian
 

6669
01:43:13,119 --> 01:43:15,510
rise and it has a more authoritarian
view it'll be kind of this very

6670
01:43:15,510 --> 01:43:15,520
view it'll be kind of this very
 

6671
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:17,990
view it'll be kind of this very
centralized east versus a decentralized

6705
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:47,830
i feel like china will drive a lot of
this

6706
01:43:47,830 --> 01:43:47,840
this
 

6707
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:51,109
this
either in response or directly i mean um

6708
01:43:51,109 --> 01:43:51,119
either in response or directly i mean um
 

6709

i think they're trying to tie it to gold
 

6717
01:43:59,199 --> 01:44:01,510
i think they're trying to tie it to gold
once again so that's an interesting

6718
01:44:01,510 --> 01:44:01,520
once again so that's an interesting
 

6719
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:03,350
once again so that's an interesting
maybe it'll be one of the more

6720
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:03,360
maybe it'll be one of the more
 

6721
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:05,350
maybe it'll be one of the more
authoritarian regime that will switch to

6722
01:44:05,350 --> 01:44:05,360
authoritarian regime that will switch to
 

6723
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:07,830
authoritarian regime that will switch to
bitcoin standard first

01:44:07,830 --> 01:44:07,840
bitcoin standard first
 

6725
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:08,709
bitcoin standard first
and then

6726
01:44:08,709 --> 01:44:08,719
and then
 

6727
01:44:08,719 --> 01:44:12,310
and then
um it's the the west that will

6728
01:44:12,310 --> 01:44:12,320
um it's the the west that will
 

6729
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:14,790
um it's the the west that will
out of that pressure will catch up

6730
01:44:14,790 --> 01:44:14,800
out of that pressure will catch up
 

6731
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:17,350
out of that pressure will catch up
versus uh versus the other way around

6732
01:44:17,350 --> 01:44:17,360
versus uh versus the other way around
 

6733
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:18,070
versus uh versus the other way around
it's

6734
01:44:18,070 --> 01:44:18,080
it's
 

6735
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:20,149
it's
it's it's fascinating to think of what

6736
01:44:20,149 --> 01:44:20,159
it's it's fascinating to think of what
 

6737
01:44:20,159 --> 01:44:21,350
it's it's fascinating to think of what
is the

6738
01:44:21,350 --> 01:44:21,360
is the
 

6739
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:23,030
is the
the forcing function

6740
01:44:23,030 --> 01:44:23,040
the forcing function
 

6741
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:25,430
the forcing function
what kind of perturbation is required to

6742
01:44:25,430 --> 01:44:25,440
what kind of perturbation is required to
 

6743
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:27,510
what kind of perturbation is required to
switch to change anything honestly about

6744
01:44:27,510 --> 01:44:27,520
switch to change anything honestly about
 

6745
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:29,189
switch to change anything honestly about
the financial system but

6746

6748
01:44:30,790 --> 01:44:30,800
it could be
 

6749
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:31,669
it could be
um

6750
01:44:31,669 --> 01:44:31,679
um
 

6751
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:33,590
um
as you're saying just waiting for the

6752
01:44:33,590 --> 01:44:33,600
as you're saying just waiting for the
 

6753
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,109
as you're saying just waiting for the
people that are young now that are

01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:40,790
enter the positions of power
essentially

6760
01:44:40,790 --> 01:44:40,800
essentially
 

6761
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:42,310
essentially
but i hope that's not the case because

6762
01:44:42,310 --> 01:44:42,320
but i hope that's not the case because
 

6763
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:43,830
but i hope that's not the case because
that's uh

6764
01:44:43,830 --> 01:44:43,840
that's uh
 

6765
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:46,790
that's uh
if for any innovation we have to wait

6766
01:44:46,790 --> 01:44:46,800
if for any innovation we have to wait
 

6767
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:49,990
if for any innovation we have to wait

make change yeah
 

6775
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:57,350
make change yeah
that is that's a super interesting topic

6776
01:44:57,350 --> 01:44:57,360
that is that's a super interesting topic
 

6777
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:58,629
that is that's a super interesting topic
of how

6778
01:44:58,629 --> 01:44:58,639
of how
 

6779
01:44:58,639 --> 01:45:00,709
of how
people's minds become less plastic as

6780
01:45:00,709 --> 01:45:00,719
people's minds become less plastic as
 

6781
01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:02,790
people's minds become less plastic as
they age yeah

6782

they age yeah
 

6783
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:04,550
they age yeah
i guess it's a feature

i guess it's a feature
 

6785
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:07,510
i guess it's a feature
it's called wisdom but then we also need

was really
 

7101
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:55,030
was really
really

7102
01:49:55,030 --> 01:49:55,040
really
 

7103
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:57,109
really
really refreshing to hear

7104
01:49:57,109 --> 01:49:57,119
really refreshing to hear
 

7105
01:49:57,119 --> 01:49:59,910
really refreshing to hear
so this is me speaking but there's a

7106
01:49:59,910 --> 01:49:59,920
so this is me speaking but there's a
 

7107
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:01,510
so this is me speaking but there's a
sense when companies

7108
01:50:01,510 --> 01:50:01,520
sense when companies
 

7109
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:03,990
sense when companies
take on these issues publicly from a ceo

7110
01:50:03,990 --> 01:50:04,000
take on these issues publicly from a ceo
 

7111

take on these issues publicly from a ceo
position or anywhere else

position or anywhere else
 

7113
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,550
position or anywhere else
that it does seem to optimize

01:50:08,550 --> 01:50:08,560
that it does seem to optimize
 

7115
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:11,830

you really have to
really put in a huge you have to hire a

7124

really put in a huge you have to hire a
 

7125
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:21,270
really put in a huge you have to hire a
huge number you basically have to create

7126
01:50:21,270 --> 01:50:21,280
huge number you basically have to create
 

7127
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:23,430
huge number you basically have to create
a company within a company to take on a

7128
01:50:23,430 --> 01:50:23,440
a company within a company to take on a
 

7129
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:26,229
a company within a company to take on a
particular thing right uh but if you

7130
01:50:26,229 --> 01:50:26,239
particular thing right uh but if you
 

7131
01:50:26,239 --> 01:50:29,270
particular thing right uh but if you
allow yourself to internally care

7132
01:50:29,270 --> 01:50:29,280
allow yourself to internally care
 

7133
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:30,709
allow yourself to internally care
about a particular issue you're

01:50:30,709 --> 01:50:30,719
about a particular issue you're
 

7135
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:33,510
about a particular issue you're
basically pacifying some number of

7136
01:50:33,510 --> 01:50:33,520
basically pacifying some number of
 

7137
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:35,589
basically pacifying some number of
employee like making sure slack doesn't

7138
01:50:35,589 --> 01:50:35,599
employee like making sure slack doesn't
 

7139
01:50:35,599 --> 01:50:38,229
employee like making sure slack doesn't
get out of hand and then you're doing

7140
01:50:38,229 --> 01:50:38,239
get out of hand and then you're doing
 

7141
01:50:38,239 --> 01:50:39,990
get out of hand and then you're doing
this kind of from my perspective

7142
01:50:39,990 --> 01:50:40,000
this kind of from my perspective
 

7143
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,149
this kind of from my perspective
especially on issues that care about

7144
01:50:42,149 --> 01:50:42,159
especially on issues that care about
 

7145
01:50:42,159 --> 01:50:44,310
especially on issues that care about
fake virtue signaling basically trying

7146
01:50:44,310 --> 01:50:44,320
fake virtue signaling basically trying
 

7147
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:46,629
fake virtue signaling basically trying
to understand what will make me look the

7148
01:50:46,629 --> 01:50:46,639
to understand what will make me look the
 

7149
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:48,149
to understand what will make me look the
best what would make the company look

7150
01:50:48,149 --> 01:50:48,159
best what would make the company look
 

7151
01:50:48,159 --> 01:50:50,310
best what would make the company look
the best in this particular aspect and

7152
01:50:50,310 --> 01:50:50,320
the best in this particular aspect and
 

7153
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:52,310
the best in this particular aspect and
it just seems very shallow and it's

7154
01:50:52,310 --> 01:50:52,320
it just seems very shallow and it's
 

7155
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:54,709
it just seems very shallow and it's
optimizing for the wrong thing not for

7156
01:50:54,709 --> 01:50:54,719

01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:26,950
culture emerge there
where like the innovation was done by

7240
01:52:26,950 --> 01:52:26,960

and of course it's kind of become
 

7365
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:23,750

7371
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:28,550
politicized at this point it's basically
either super left or super right and

7372
01:54:28,550 --> 01:54:28,560
either super left or super right and
 

7373
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:29,669
either super left or super right and
it's not really

7374
01:54:29,669 --> 01:54:29,679
it's not really
 

7375
01:54:29,679 --> 01:54:31,430
it's not really

01:59:27,750 --> 01:59:27,760
it's kind of the internet which is where
 

7715
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:29,830
it's kind of the internet which is where
is the source of a lot of this where

7716
01:59:29,830 --> 01:59:29,840
is the source of a lot of this where
 

7717
01:59:29,840 --> 01:59:32,310
is the source of a lot of this where
people have a voice is making the power

7718
01:59:32,310 --> 01:59:32,320
people have a voice is making the power

02:00:04,550 --> 02:00:04,560
world where the internet is really
 

7751
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:06,310
world where the internet is really
finally taking hold where there's

7752
02:00:06,310 --> 02:00:06,320
finally taking hold where there's
 

7753
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:08,390
finally taking hold where there's
billions of devices and everybody has a

7754
02:00:08,390 --> 02:00:08,400
billions of devices and everybody has a
 

7755
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:10,830
billions of devices and everybody has a
voice it's it's almost

7756
02:00:10,830 --> 02:00:10,840
voice it's it's almost
 

7757
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:13,830
voice it's it's almost
uh basically governments

7758
02:00:13,830 --> 02:00:13,840
uh basically governments
 

7759
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:15,830
uh basically governments
and powerful people

7760
02:00:15,830 --> 02:00:15,840
and powerful people
 

7761
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:18,310
and powerful people
are slightly losing hold of power and

7762
02:00:18,310 --> 02:00:18,320
are slightly losing hold of power and
 

7763
02:00:18,320 --> 02:00:19,589
are slightly losing hold of power and
they're starting to freak out a little

7764
02:00:19,589 --> 02:00:19,599
they're starting to freak out a little
 

7765
02:00:19,599 --> 02:00:20,310
they're starting to freak out a little
bit

7766
02:00:20,310 --> 02:00:20,320
bit
 

7767
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:22,950
bit
that's it and so and then once you have

7768
02:00:22,950 --> 02:00:22,960
that's it and so and then once you have
 

7769
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:25,589
that's it and so and then once you have
young people that are coming up now

7770
02:00:25,589 --> 02:00:25,599
young people that are coming up now
 

7771
02:00:25,599 --> 02:00:27,910
young people that are coming up now
gain power i think will will rebalance

7772
02:00:27,910 --> 02:00:27,920
gain power i think will will rebalance
 

7773
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:29,750
gain power i think will will rebalance
everything and and then there's yeah

7774
02:00:29,750 --> 02:00:29,760
everything and and then there's yeah
 

7775
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:31,910
everything and and then there's yeah
like you said promising signs

7776
02:00:31,910 --> 02:00:31,920
like you said promising signs
 

7777
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:33,109
like you said promising signs

your question about leadership i think
 

7943
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:13,030
your question about leadership i think
i basically just kept doing things that

7944
02:03:13,030 --> 02:03:13,040
i basically just kept doing things that
 

7945
02:03:13,040 --> 02:03:14,950
i basically just kept doing things that
were a little outside my comfort zone

7946
02:03:14,950 --> 02:03:14,960
were a little outside my comfort zone
 

7947
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:16,390
were a little outside my comfort zone
and then my comfort zone kept getting

7948
02:03:16,390 --> 02:03:16,400
and then my comfort zone kept getting
 

7949
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:18,709
and then my comfort zone kept getting
bigger and bigger you know yeah and so

7961
02:03:28,080 --> 02:03:29,350
it's like a little outside and like when
i first started coinbase i had never

7962
02:03:29,350 --> 02:03:29,360
i first started coinbase i had never
 

7963
02:03:29,360 --> 02:03:30,629
i first started coinbase i had never
managed anybody i would have i would

7964
02:03:30,629 --> 02:03:30,639
managed anybody i would have i would
 

7965
02:03:30,639 --> 02:03:31,669
managed anybody i would have i would
have never i would have been scared to

7966
02:03:31,669 --> 02:03:31,679
have never i would have been scared to
 

7967
02:03:31,679 --> 02:03:33,189
have never i would have been scared to
death to have put out like a very

7968
02:03:33,189 --> 02:03:33,199
death to have put out like a very
 

7969
02:03:33,199 --> 02:03:34,790
death to have put out like a very
controversial opinion like that and sort

7970
02:03:34,790 --> 02:03:34,800
controversial opinion like that and sort
 

7971
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:35,750
controversial opinion like that and sort
of

7972
02:03:35,750 --> 02:03:35,760
of
 

7973
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:36,629
of
all right

7974
02:03:36,629 --> 02:03:36,639
all right
 

7975
02:03:36,639 --> 02:03:38,229
all right
five percent of people go you know we

7976
02:03:38,229 --> 02:03:38,239
five percent of people go you know we
 

7977
02:03:38,239 --> 02:03:39,189
five percent of people go you know we
didn't know what percent was gonna be by

7978
02:03:39,189 --> 02:03:39,199
didn't know what percent was gonna be by
 

7979
02:03:39,199 --> 02:03:40,070
didn't know what percent was gonna be by
the way it could have been one percent

7980
02:03:40,070 --> 02:03:40,080
the way it could have been one percent
 

7981
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:42,390
the way it could have been one percent
it could have been fifty percent like

7982
02:03:42,390 --> 02:03:42,400
it could have been fifty percent like
 

7983
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:44,550
it could have been fifty percent like
but we went into it scary because i it

7984
02:03:44,550 --> 02:03:44,560
but we went into it scary because i it
 

7985
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:46,070
but we went into it scary because i it
was a scary thing i was like i don't

7986
02:03:46,070 --> 02:03:46,080
was a scary thing i was like i don't
 

7987
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:47,669
was a scary thing i was like i don't
know i think this is right i'm just

7988
02:03:47,669 --> 02:03:47,679
know i think this is right i'm just
 

7989
02:03:47,679 --> 02:03:49,189
know i think this is right i'm just
gonna do it

7990
02:03:49,189 --> 02:03:49,199
gonna do it
 

7991
02:03:49,199 --> 02:03:50,550
gonna do it
so if you do if you do enough scary

7992
02:03:50,550 --> 02:03:50,560
so if you do if you do enough scary
 

7993
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:52,709
so if you do if you do enough scary
things like you'll build the confidence

7994
02:03:52,709 --> 02:03:52,719
things like you'll build the confidence
 

7995
02:03:52,719 --> 02:03:54,069
things like you'll build the confidence
and i feel like i'm still on that

7996
02:03:54,069 --> 02:03:54,079
and i feel like i'm still on that
 

7997
02:03:54,079 --> 02:03:56,069
and i feel like i'm still on that
journey every every year or two at

7998
02:03:56,069 --> 02:03:56,079
journey every every year or two at
 

7999
02:03:56,079 --> 02:03:57,910
journey every every year or two at
coinbase there's some big thing that

8000
02:03:57,910 --> 02:03:57,920
coinbase there's some big thing that
 

8001
02:03:57,920 --> 02:03:59,430
coinbase there's some big thing that
comes out is like oh my god like i

8002
02:03:59,430 --> 02:03:59,440
comes out is like oh my god like i
 

8003
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:00,790
comes out is like oh my god like i
didn't sleep well for a week and like

8004
02:04:00,790 --> 02:04:00,800
didn't sleep well for a week and like
 

8005
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:03,109
didn't sleep well for a week and like
this is the next level right

8006
02:04:03,109 --> 02:04:03,119
this is the next level right
 

8007
02:04:03,119 --> 02:04:04,390
this is the next level right
um but that's how you that's how you

02:04:04,390 --> 02:04:04,400
um but that's how you that's how you
 

8009
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:06,390
um but that's how you that's how you
learn and grow so you're still going up

8010
02:04:06,390 --> 02:04:06,400
learn and grow so you're still going up
 

8011
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:08,629
learn and grow so you're still going up
that mountain through the fog one step

8012
02:04:08,629 --> 02:04:08,639
that mountain through the fog one step
 

8013
02:04:08,639 --> 02:04:11,830
that mountain through the fog one step
at a time yeah uh can i just quickly ask

8014
02:04:11,830 --> 02:04:11,840
at a time yeah uh can i just quickly ask
 

8015
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:13,910
at a time yeah uh can i just quickly ask
you about a couple of other efforts that

8016
02:04:13,910 --> 02:04:13,920
you about a couple of other efforts that
 

8017
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:15,109
you about a couple of other efforts that
are super interesting that you're

8018
02:04:15,109 --> 02:04:15,119
are super interesting that you're
 

8019

involved with so first of all
a little bit more old school fascinating

8022
02:04:19,270 --> 02:04:19,280
a little bit more old school fascinating
 

8023
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:21,109
a little bit more old school fascinating
effort of research hub

8024
02:04:21,109 --> 02:04:21,119
effort of research hub
 

8025
02:04:21,119 --> 02:04:22,229
effort of research hub
um

8026
02:04:22,229 --> 02:04:22,239
um
 

8027
02:04:22,239 --> 02:04:24,310

so what what what's that about the
 

8029
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:26,870
so what what what's that about the
github for open science

8030
02:04:26,870 --> 02:04:26,880
github for open science
 

8031
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:28,629
github for open science
yeah okay so basically i've had a chance

8032
02:04:28,629 --> 02:04:28,639
yeah okay so basically i've had a chance
 

8033
02:04:28,639 --> 02:04:29,910
yeah okay so basically i've had a chance
to try to help a couple other companies

and
um one of them i've always thought about

8042
02:04:37,030 --> 02:04:37,040
um one of them i've always thought about
 

8043
02:04:37,040 --> 02:04:39,750
um one of them i've always thought about
like why is scientific research

8044
02:04:39,750 --> 02:04:39,760
like why is scientific research
 

8045
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:41,189
like why is scientific research
not more like open source software or

8046
02:04:41,189 --> 02:04:41,199
not more like open source software or
 

8047
02:04:41,199 --> 02:04:42,709
not more like open source software or
why couldn't it be much faster right and

8048
02:04:42,709 --> 02:04:42,719
why couldn't it be much faster right and
 

8049
02:04:42,719 --> 02:04:43,430
why couldn't it be much faster right and
there's

8050
02:04:43,430 --> 02:04:43,440
there's
 

8051
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:44,870
there's
you've probably have seen this like in

8052
02:04:44,870 --> 02:04:44,880
you've probably have seen this like in
 

8053
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:46,790
you've probably have seen this like in
an academic setting right but

8054
02:04:46,790 --> 02:04:46,800
an academic setting right but
 

8055
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:47,910
an academic setting right but
there's all kinds of things that feel

8056
02:04:47,910 --> 02:04:47,920
there's all kinds of things that feel
 

8057
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:49,750
there's all kinds of things that feel
very antiquated to me about scientific

8058
02:04:49,750 --> 02:04:49,760
very antiquated to me about scientific
 

8059
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:51,589
very antiquated to me about scientific
research everything from

8060
02:04:51,589 --> 02:04:51,599
research everything from
 

8061
02:04:51,599 --> 02:04:54,390
research everything from
the funding process and grants to how

8062
02:04:54,390 --> 02:04:54,400
the funding process and grants to how
 

8063
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:56,950
the funding process and grants to how
peer review works to how you submit the

8064
02:04:56,950 --> 02:04:56,960
peer review works to how you submit the
 

8065
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:58,790
peer review works to how you submit the
journals all the costs associated with

8066
02:04:58,790 --> 02:04:58,800
journals all the costs associated with
 

8067
02:04:58,800 --> 02:04:59,830
journals all the costs associated with
journals

8068
02:04:59,830 --> 02:04:59,840
journals
 

8069
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:01,430
journals
you know that the people you'd think

8070
02:05:01,430 --> 02:05:01,440
you know that the people you'd think
 

8071
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:02,550
you know that the people you'd think
like you'd get paid for this or

8072
02:05:02,550 --> 02:05:02,560
like you'd get paid for this or
 

8073
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:03,669
like you'd get paid for this or
something and it would then be available

8074
02:05:03,669 --> 02:05:03,679
something and it would then be available
 

8075
02:05:03,679 --> 02:05:05,350
something and it would then be available
to all the taxpayers for free but no

8076
02:05:05,350 --> 02:05:05,360
to all the taxpayers for free but no
 

8077
02:05:05,360 --> 02:05:06,629
to all the taxpayers for free but no
they're like they're all paywalled and

8078
02:05:06,629 --> 02:05:06,639
they're like they're all paywalled and
 

8079
02:05:06,639 --> 02:05:08,069
they're like they're all paywalled and
there's like these big companies that

8080
02:05:08,069 --> 02:05:08,079
there's like these big companies that
 

8081
02:05:08,079 --> 02:05:09,270
there's like these big companies that
have sort of

8082
02:05:09,270 --> 02:05:09,280
have sort of
 

8083
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:10,709
have sort of
in my view kind of held back um

8084
02:05:10,709 --> 02:05:10,719
in my view kind of held back um
 

8085
02:05:10,719 --> 02:05:11,910
in my view kind of held back um
innovation here

8086
02:05:11,910 --> 02:05:11,920
innovation here
 

8087
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:13,030
innovation here
so and

8088
02:05:13,030 --> 02:05:13,040
so and
 

8089
02:05:13,040 --> 02:05:14,950
so and
the preprint servers like bioarchive and

8090
02:05:14,950 --> 02:05:14,960
the preprint servers like bioarchive and
 

8091
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:16,629
the preprint servers like bioarchive and
archive.org have really helped this but

8092
02:05:16,629 --> 02:05:16,639
archive.org have really helped this but
 

8093
02:05:16,639 --> 02:05:18,069
archive.org have really helped this but
those websites are they look like

8094
02:05:18,069 --> 02:05:18,079
those websites are they look like
 

8095
02:05:18,079 --> 02:05:19,669
those websites are they look like
they're kind of from like 15 years ago

8096
02:05:19,669 --> 02:05:19,679
they're kind of from like 15 years ago
 

8097
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:21,669
they're kind of from like 15 years ago
or something yeah it's like craigslist

yeah
so anyway i one of the things i

8102
02:05:24,629 --> 02:05:24,639
so anyway i one of the things i
 

8103
02:05:24,639 --> 02:05:26,149
so anyway i one of the things i
once once coinbase went public last year

8104
02:05:26,149 --> 02:05:26,159
once once coinbase went public last year
 

8105
02:05:26,159 --> 02:05:27,189
once once coinbase went public last year
i had a little bit of liquidity and i

8106
02:05:27,189 --> 02:05:27,199
i had a little bit of liquidity and i
 

8107
02:05:27,199 --> 02:05:28,550
i had a little bit of liquidity and i
was like all right let me fund a small

8108
02:05:28,550 --> 02:05:28,560
was like all right let me fund a small
 

8109
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:30,390
was like all right let me fund a small
team let's see if we can

8110
02:05:30,390 --> 02:05:30,400
team let's see if we can
 

8111
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:31,910
team let's see if we can

02:06:16,470 --> 02:06:16,480
the other thing i've noticed in life is
 

8163
02:06:16,480 --> 02:06:17,990
the other thing i've noticed in life is
that there's kind of like there's a

8164
02:06:17,990 --> 02:06:18,000
that there's kind of like there's a
 

8165
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:19,189
that there's kind of like there's a
bunch of people working on science and

8166
02:06:19,189 --> 02:06:19,199
bunch of people working on science and
 

8167
02:06:19,199 --> 02:06:20,069
bunch of people working on science and
there's a bunch of people building

8168
02:06:20,069 --> 02:06:20,079
there's a bunch of people building
 

8169
02:06:20,079 --> 02:06:22,470
there's a bunch of people building
companies and they very very rarely

8170
02:06:22,470 --> 02:06:22,480
companies and they very very rarely
 

8171
02:06:22,480 --> 02:06:24,550
companies and they very very rarely
intersect but when they do you get the

8172
02:06:24,550 --> 02:06:24,560
intersect but when they do you get the
 

8173
02:06:24,560 --> 02:06:26,470
intersect but when they do you get the
best things like like spacex and

8174
02:06:26,470 --> 02:06:26,480
best things like like spacex and
 

8175
02:06:26,480 --> 02:06:28,790
best things like like spacex and
genentech and even google and like even

8176
02:06:28,790 --> 02:06:28,800
genentech and even google and like even
 

8177
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:30,870
genentech and even google and like even
coinbase was based on a research paper

8178
02:06:30,870 --> 02:06:30,880
coinbase was based on a research paper
 

8179
02:06:30,880 --> 02:06:32,310
coinbase was based on a research paper
the bitcoin white paper

8180
02:06:32,310 --> 02:06:32,320
the bitcoin white paper
 

8181
02:06:32,320 --> 02:06:34,390
the bitcoin white paper
and so most business people are like

8182
02:06:34,390 --> 02:06:34,400
and so most business people are like
 

8183
02:06:34,400 --> 02:06:35,750
and so most business people are like
creating companies that don't have any

8184
02:06:35,750 --> 02:06:35,760
creating companies that don't have any
 

8185
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:37,830
creating companies that don't have any
scientific innovation they're just like

8186
02:06:37,830 --> 02:06:37,840
scientific innovation they're just like
 

8187
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:40,229
scientific innovation they're just like
marketing based on you know whatever and

8188
02:06:40,229 --> 02:06:40,239
marketing based on you know whatever and
 

8189
02:06:40,239 --> 02:06:42,390
marketing based on you know whatever and
then a lot of scientists are making

8190
02:06:42,390 --> 02:06:42,400
then a lot of scientists are making
 

8191
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:44,149
then a lot of scientists are making
things which never actually benefit

8192
02:06:44,149 --> 02:06:44,159
things which never actually benefit
 

8193
02:06:44,159 --> 02:06:45,109
things which never actually benefit
humanity because they're not

8194
02:06:45,109 --> 02:06:45,119
humanity because they're not
 

8195
02:06:45,119 --> 02:06:47,510

commercialized and turned into products

8196
02:06:47,510 --> 02:06:47,520
commercialized and turned into products
 

8197
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:48,390
commercialized and turned into products
and so

8198
02:06:48,390 --> 02:06:48,400
and so
 

8199
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:50,310
and so
if we can somehow create a translation

8200
02:06:50,310 --> 02:06:50,320
if we can somehow create a translation
 

8201
02:06:50,320 --> 02:06:52,149
if we can somehow create a translation
layer between those two groups and help

8210
02:06:59,030 --> 02:06:59,040
forces so that they're more incentivized
 

8211
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:01,109
forces so that they're more incentivized
like if you if you discover crispr or

8212

scientific innovations and so that's

8228
02:07:15,589 --> 02:07:15,599
scientific innovations and so that's
 

8229
02:07:15,599 --> 02:07:17,109
scientific innovations and so that's
kind of like the long-term vision for

outside of academia might not be
 

8257
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:44,390
outside of academia might not be
familiar with an absurd situation so

8258
02:07:44,390 --> 02:07:44,400
familiar with an absurd situation so
 

8259
02:07:44,400 --> 02:07:47,189
familiar with an absurd situation so
there's journals like you mentioned

8260
02:07:47,189 --> 02:07:47,199
there's journals like you mentioned
 

8261

there's journals like you mentioned
and

8262

and
 

8267
02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:56,310
and
the journals provide very little value

8268
02:07:56,310 --> 02:07:56,320
the journals provide very little value
 

8269
02:07:56,320 --> 02:07:57,589
the journals provide very little value
except

8270
02:07:57,589 --> 02:07:57,599
except
 

8271
02:07:57,599 --> 02:07:59,669
except
matching you with reviewers that are

8272
02:07:59,669 --> 02:07:59,679
matching you with reviewers that are
 

8273
02:07:59,679 --> 02:08:01,669
matching you with reviewers that are
unpaid

8274
02:08:01,669 --> 02:08:01,679
unpaid
 

8275
02:08:01,679 --> 02:08:03,270
unpaid
and so

8276
02:08:03,270 --> 02:08:03,280
and so
 

8277
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:04,149
and so
uh

8278
02:08:04,149 --> 02:08:04,159
uh
 

8279
02:08:04,159 --> 02:08:06,069
uh
in the digital world they're providing

8280
02:08:06,069 --> 02:08:06,079
in the digital world they're providing
 

8281
02:08:06,079 --> 02:08:08,069
in the digital world they're providing
basically almost no value except hosting

8282
02:08:08,069 --> 02:08:08,079
basically almost no value except hosting
 

8283
02:08:08,079 --> 02:08:10,229
basically almost no value except hosting
your paper

8284
02:08:10,229 --> 02:08:10,239
your paper
 

8285
02:08:10,239 --> 02:08:13,510
your paper
and they put up a paywall and charge

8286
02:08:13,510 --> 02:08:13,520
and they put up a paywall and charge
 

8287
02:08:13,520 --> 02:08:14,470
and they put up a paywall and charge
people

8288
02:08:14,470 --> 02:08:14,480
people
 

8289
02:08:14,480 --> 02:08:16,950
people
to access that and that charge is not

8290
02:08:16,950 --> 02:08:16,960
to access that and that charge is not
 

8291
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:18,870
to access that and that charge is not
like even netflix fees you're talking

8292
02:08:18,870 --> 02:08:18,880
like even netflix fees you're talking
 

8293
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:20,790
like even netflix fees you're talking
about a lot of money

8294
02:08:20,790 --> 02:08:20,800
about a lot of money
 

8295
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:22,629
about a lot of money
so they're basically

8296
02:08:22,629 --> 02:08:22,639
so they're basically
 

8297
02:08:22,639 --> 02:08:24,470
so they're basically
blocking your research that should be

8298
02:08:24,470 --> 02:08:24,480
blocking your research that should be
 

8299
02:08:24,480 --> 02:08:25,990
blocking your research that should be
wide open

8300
02:08:25,990 --> 02:08:26,000
wide open
 

8301
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,310
wide open
uh from the world and creating a paywall

8302
02:08:28,310 --> 02:08:28,320
uh from the world and creating a paywall
 

8303
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:30,709
uh from the world and creating a paywall
it's a fascinating like scam that's

8304
02:08:30,709 --> 02:08:30,719
it's a fascinating like scam that's
 

8305
02:08:30,719 --> 02:08:32,629
it's a fascinating like scam that's
actually holding back

8306
02:08:32,629 --> 02:08:32,639
actually holding back
 

8307
02:08:32,639 --> 02:08:34,550
actually holding back
i don't it's it's a shitty scam because

8308
02:08:34,550 --> 02:08:34,560
i don't it's it's a shitty scam because
 

8309
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:37,109
i don't it's it's a shitty scam because
you're not making that much money

8310
02:08:37,109 --> 02:08:37,119
you're not making that much money
 

8311
02:08:37,119 --> 02:08:38,709
you're not making that much money
i feel like a definition of a scam you

8312
02:08:38,709 --> 02:08:38,719
i feel like a definition of a scam you
 

8313
02:08:38,719 --> 02:08:40,870
i feel like a definition of a scam you
should at least be making money that's

8314
02:08:40,870 --> 02:08:40,880
should at least be making money that's
 

8315
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:42,550
should at least be making money that's
like significant amount of money you're

8316
02:08:42,550 --> 02:08:42,560
like significant amount of money you're
 

8317
02:08:42,560 --> 02:08:44,470
like significant amount of money you're
basically making shitty money and

8318
02:08:44,470 --> 02:08:44,480
basically making shitty money and
 

8319
02:08:44,480 --> 02:08:46,709
basically making shitty money and
holding back all of human knowledge okay

8320
02:08:46,709 --> 02:08:46,719
holding back all of human knowledge okay
 

8321
02:08:46,719 --> 02:08:48,390
holding back all of human knowledge okay
so that put aside and people get a

8322
02:08:48,390 --> 02:08:48,400
so that put aside and people get a
 

8323
02:08:48,400 --> 02:08:51,189
so that put aside and people get a
little confused because the journals

8324
02:08:51,189 --> 02:08:51,199
little confused because the journals
 

8325
02:08:51,199 --> 02:08:53,270
little confused because the journals
aren't the ones paying the scientists

8326
02:08:53,270 --> 02:08:53,280
aren't the ones paying the scientists
 

8327
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:55,109
aren't the ones paying the scientists
people think like the journals are

8328
02:08:55,109 --> 02:08:55,119
people think like the journals are
 

8329
02:08:55,119 --> 02:08:57,589
people think like the journals are
somehow funding the scientists

8330
02:08:57,589 --> 02:08:57,599
somehow funding the scientists
 

8331
02:08:57,599 --> 02:08:59,030
somehow funding the scientists
therefore

8332
02:08:59,030 --> 02:08:59,040
therefore
 

8333
02:08:59,040 --> 02:09:01,030
therefore
they have the right to put up a paywall

8334
02:09:01,030 --> 02:09:01,040
they have the right to put up a paywall
 

8335
02:09:01,040 --> 02:09:02,870
they have the right to put up a paywall
no no the funding is coming from

8336
02:09:02,870 --> 02:09:02,880
no no the funding is coming from
 

8337
02:09:02,880 --> 02:09:04,790
no no the funding is coming from
elsewhere journals yeah are the middle

8338
02:09:04,790 --> 02:09:04,800
elsewhere journals yeah are the middle
 

8339
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:07,430
elsewhere journals yeah are the middle
man that nobody asked for especially in

8340
02:09:07,430 --> 02:09:07,440
man that nobody asked for especially in
 

8341
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:09,270
man that nobody asked for especially in
the digital world anyway

8342
02:09:09,270 --> 02:09:09,280
the digital world anyway
 

8343
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:11,350
the digital world anyway
that said there is uh

8344
02:09:11,350 --> 02:09:11,360
that said there is uh
 

8345
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:13,510
that said there is uh
interesting kind of incentives for

8346
02:09:13,510 --> 02:09:13,520
interesting kind of incentives for
 

8347
02:09:13,520 --> 02:09:15,990
interesting kind of incentives for
scientists which is prestige and so on

8348
02:09:15,990 --> 02:09:16,000
scientists which is prestige and so on
 

8349
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:17,589
scientists which is prestige and so on
so

8350
02:09:17,589 --> 02:09:17,599
so
 

8351
02:09:17,599 --> 02:09:18,709
so
there's a

8352
02:09:18,709 --> 02:09:18,719
there's a
 

8353
02:09:18,719 --> 02:09:20,470
there's a
thing with journals if there's if

8354
02:09:20,470 --> 02:09:20,480
thing with journals if there's if
 

8355
02:09:20,480 --> 02:09:22,229
thing with journals if there's if
there's a prestigious journal

8356
02:09:22,229 --> 02:09:22,239
there's a prestigious journal
 

8357
02:09:22,239 --> 02:09:25,109
there's a prestigious journal
and you uh pass the review process you

8358
02:09:25,109 --> 02:09:25,119
and you uh pass the review process you
 

8359
02:09:25,119 --> 02:09:26,629
and you uh pass the review process you
get into that journal

8360
02:09:26,629 --> 02:09:26,639
get into that journal
 

8361
02:09:26,639 --> 02:09:28,870
get into that journal
or a prestigious conference in computer

8362
02:09:28,870 --> 02:09:28,880
or a prestigious conference in computer
 

8363
02:09:28,880 --> 02:09:31,750
or a prestigious conference in computer
science then that's seen as a good thing

8364
02:09:31,750 --> 02:09:31,760
science then that's seen as a good thing
 

8365
02:09:31,760 --> 02:09:33,350
science then that's seen as a good thing
in your resume

8366
02:09:33,350 --> 02:09:33,360
in your resume
 

8367
02:09:33,360 --> 02:09:35,430
in your resume
and not just your resume within your

and not just your resume within your
 

8369
02:09:35,440 --> 02:09:37,430
and not just your resume within your
community that's a respected thing is

8370
02:09:37,430 --> 02:09:37,440
community that's a respected thing is
 

8371
02:09:37,440 --> 02:09:39,750
community that's a respected thing is
there some way to achieve that same kind

8372
02:09:39,750 --> 02:09:39,760
there some way to achieve that same kind
 

8373
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:42,550
there some way to achieve that same kind
of incentive in an open um

8374
02:09:42,550 --> 02:09:42,560
of incentive in an open um
 

8375
02:09:42,560 --> 02:09:44,790
of incentive in an open um
in the open setting of research hub so

8376
02:09:44,790 --> 02:09:44,800
in the open setting of research hub so
 

8377
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:47,990
in the open setting of research hub so
like where i could say i got

8378
02:09:47,990 --> 02:09:48,000
like where i could say i got
 

8379
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,709
like where i could say i got
x y and z like look i'm impressive

8380
02:09:50,709 --> 02:09:50,719
x y and z like look i'm impressive
 

8381
02:09:50,719 --> 02:09:52,629
x y and z like look i'm impressive
because this happened on research hub i

8382
02:09:52,629 --> 02:09:52,639
because this happened on research hub i
 

8383
02:09:52,639 --> 02:09:54,470
because this happened on research hub i
think you're right like the whole um

8384
02:09:54,470 --> 02:09:54,480
think you're right like the whole um
 

8385
02:09:54,480 --> 02:09:57,350
think you're right like the whole um
academia like progress track is about

8386
02:09:57,350 --> 02:09:57,360
academia like progress track is about
 

8387
02:09:57,360 --> 02:09:58,950
academia like progress track is about
like where you got published and how

8388
02:09:58,950 --> 02:09:58,960
like where you got published and how
 

8389
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:00,629
like where you got published and how
many citations and it's kind of like a

8390
02:10:00,629 --> 02:10:00,639
many citations and it's kind of like a
 

8391
02:10:00,639 --> 02:10:02,069
many citations and it's kind of like a
false economy

8392
02:10:02,069 --> 02:10:02,079
false economy
 

8393
02:10:02,079 --> 02:10:03,430
false economy
of um

8394
02:10:03,430 --> 02:10:03,440
of um
 

8395
02:10:03,440 --> 02:10:05,109
of um
reputation because like there's not real

8396
02:10:05,109 --> 02:10:05,119
reputation because like there's not real
 

8397
02:10:05,119 --> 02:10:07,910
reputation because like there's not real
money backing it and so i think we've

8398
02:10:07,910 --> 02:10:07,920
money backing it and so i think we've
 

8399
02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:10,069
money backing it and so i think we've
thought about this a little bit um

8400
02:10:10,069 --> 02:10:10,079
thought about this a little bit um
 

8401
02:10:10,079 --> 02:10:11,510
thought about this a little bit um
and i think the research hub team has an

8402
02:10:11,510 --> 02:10:11,520
and i think the research hub team has an
 

8403
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:13,990
and i think the research hub team has an
opportunity to do something here that

8404
02:10:13,990 --> 02:10:14,000
opportunity to do something here that
 

8405
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:15,830
opportunity to do something here that
basically says like okay i had the top

8406
02:10:15,830 --> 02:10:15,840
basically says like okay i had the top
 

8407
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:18,790
basically says like okay i had the top
paper for 2022 in

8408
02:10:18,790 --> 02:10:18,800
paper for 2022 in
 

8409
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:21,910
paper for 2022 in
um you know biology on in here and you

8410
02:10:21,910 --> 02:10:21,920
um you know biology on in here and you
 

8411
02:10:21,920 --> 02:10:23,589
um you know biology on in here and you
basically publish a list a leaderboards

8412
02:10:23,589 --> 02:10:23,599
basically publish a list a leaderboards
 

8413
02:10:23,599 --> 02:10:25,990
basically publish a list a leaderboards
of these like top you know for the month

8414
02:10:25,990 --> 02:10:26,000
of these like top you know for the month
 

8415
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,229
of these like top you know for the month
the the year um in all these different

8416
02:10:28,229 --> 02:10:28,239
the the year um in all these different
 

8417
02:10:28,239 --> 02:10:30,069
the the year um in all these different
categories then actually you know we

8418
02:10:30,069 --> 02:10:30,079
categories then actually you know we
 

8419
02:10:30,079 --> 02:10:31,830
categories then actually you know we
should probably give out grants and

8420
02:10:31,830 --> 02:10:31,840
should probably give out grants and
 

8421
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:34,629
should probably give out grants and
awards um in in addition to that fund

8422
02:10:34,629 --> 02:10:34,639
awards um in in addition to that fund
 

8423
02:10:34,639 --> 02:10:37,109
awards um in in addition to that fund
those people almost like fellows or

8424
02:10:37,109 --> 02:10:37,119
those people almost like fellows or
 

8425
02:10:37,119 --> 02:10:38,709
those people almost like fellows or
even give out like you know like the

8426
02:10:38,709 --> 02:10:38,719
even give out like you know like the
 

8427

even give out like you know like the
nobel prize

8428
02:10:39,910 --> 02:10:39,920
nobel prize
 

8429
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:41,109
nobel prize
there should be like a research hub

8430
02:10:41,109 --> 02:10:41,119
there should be like a research hub
 

8431
02:10:41,119 --> 02:10:43,750
there should be like a research hub
prize or something and like ship people

8432
02:10:43,750 --> 02:10:43,760
prize or something and like ship people
 

8433
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:46,149
prize or something and like ship people
maybe maybe even ship like a print

8434
02:10:46,149 --> 02:10:46,159
maybe maybe even ship like a print
 

8435
02:10:46,159 --> 02:10:48,629
maybe maybe even ship like a print
version of a journal that is the top

8436
02:10:48,629 --> 02:10:48,639

8437
02:10:48,639 --> 02:10:50,709

whatever and like people want to put
 

8441
02:10:52,239 --> 02:10:53,750
whatever and like people want to put
that in their wall in in the lab and

8442
02:10:53,750 --> 02:10:53,760
that in their wall in in the lab and
 

8443
02:10:53,760 --> 02:10:56,550
that in their wall in in the lab and
like so i do think we need to sort of

8444
02:10:56,550 --> 02:10:56,560
like so i do think we need to sort of
 

8445
02:10:56,560 --> 02:10:58,870
like so i do think we need to sort of
change i don't know like the traditional

8446
02:10:58,870 --> 02:10:58,880
change i don't know like the traditional
 

8447
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:00,390
change i don't know like the traditional
folks in academia or science would

8448
02:11:00,390 --> 02:11:00,400
folks in academia or science would
 

8449
02:11:00,400 --> 02:11:01,830
folks in academia or science would
probably think this is like crazy a

8450
02:11:01,830 --> 02:11:01,840
probably think this is like crazy a
 

8451
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:03,669
probably think this is like crazy a
crazy idea but i think we need to change

like
 

8465
02:11:13,119 --> 02:11:15,030
like
paywall journals like because that's

8466
02:11:15,030 --> 02:11:15,040
paywall journals like because that's
 

8467
02:11:15,040 --> 02:11:17,189
paywall journals like because that's

it's just not helping humanity so like
 

8469
02:11:17,199 --> 02:11:18,950
it's just not helping humanity so like
you know it should be more prestigious

8470
02:11:18,950 --> 02:11:18,960
you know it should be more prestigious
 

8471
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:19,990
you know it should be more prestigious
to publish

8472

to publish
 

8473
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,310
to publish
in an open science way

8474
02:11:22,310 --> 02:11:22,320
in an open science way
 

8475
02:11:22,320 --> 02:11:24,229
in an open science way
and get the top spot that should be

8476
02:11:24,229 --> 02:11:24,239
and get the top spot that should be
 

8477
02:11:24,239 --> 02:11:25,750
and get the top spot that should be
celebrated above being published in

8478

of them you know well there's currently

8482
02:11:29,510 --> 02:11:29,520
of them you know well there's currently
 

8483
02:11:29,520 --> 02:11:31,270
of them you know well there's currently
it's the culture has already shifted to

8484
02:11:31,270 --> 02:11:31,280
it's the culture has already shifted to
 

8485
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:33,030
it's the culture has already shifted to
where almost everybody publishes an

8486
02:11:33,030 --> 02:11:33,040
where almost everybody publishes an
 

8487
02:11:33,040 --> 02:11:36,069
where almost everybody publishes an
archive and by archive and so on yeah

8488
02:11:36,069 --> 02:11:36,079
archive and by archive and so on yeah
 

8489
02:11:36,079 --> 02:11:37,270
archive and by archive and so on yeah
but

8490
02:11:37,270 --> 02:11:37,280
but
 

8491
02:11:37,280 --> 02:11:39,030
but
so that the culture is there on that

8492
02:11:39,030 --> 02:11:39,040
so that the culture is there on that
 

8493
02:11:39,040 --> 02:11:41,109
so that the culture is there on that
that scene friends don't let friends not

that scene friends don't let friends not
 

8495
02:11:41,119 --> 02:11:44,069
that scene friends don't let friends not
publish open but then the prestige thing

8496
02:11:44,069 --> 02:11:44,079
publish open but then the prestige thing
 

8497
02:11:44,079 --> 02:11:45,910
publish open but then the prestige thing
is missing which is like anyone can

8498
02:11:45,910 --> 02:11:45,920
is missing which is like anyone can
 

8499
02:11:45,920 --> 02:11:48,229
is missing which is like anyone can
publish an archive yeah so how do you

8500
02:11:48,229 --> 02:11:48,239
publish an archive yeah so how do you
 

8501
02:11:48,239 --> 02:11:50,390
publish an archive yeah so how do you
know it's actually a strong paper now

8502
02:11:50,390 --> 02:11:50,400
know it's actually a strong paper now
 

8503
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:53,270
know it's actually a strong paper now
funny enough even with the crappy

8504
02:11:53,270 --> 02:11:53,280
funny enough even with the crappy
 

8505
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:55,030
funny enough even with the crappy
systems we have now

8506
02:11:55,030 --> 02:11:55,040
systems we have now
 

8507
02:11:55,040 --> 02:11:57,109
systems we have now
word of mouth is powerful like you have

8508
02:11:57,109 --> 02:11:57,119
word of mouth is powerful like you have
 

8509
02:11:57,119 --> 02:11:59,669
word of mouth is powerful like you have
a like citation system is pretty

8510
02:11:59,669 --> 02:11:59,679
a like citation system is pretty
 

8511
02:11:59,679 --> 02:12:01,430
a like citation system is pretty
powerful so like you say okay this is a

8512
02:12:01,430 --> 02:12:01,440
powerful so like you say okay this is a
 

8513
02:12:01,440 --> 02:12:04,470
powerful so like you say okay this is a
strong paper we don't need reviewers our

8514
02:12:04,470 --> 02:12:04,480
strong paper we don't need reviewers our
 

8515
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:06,470
strong paper we don't need reviewers our
human eyes are the reviewers like that

8516
02:12:06,470 --> 02:12:06,480
human eyes are the reviewers like that
 

8517
02:12:06,480 --> 02:12:08,629
human eyes are the reviewers like that
the community are the reviewers so it's

8518
02:12:08,629 --> 02:12:08,639
the community are the reviewers so it's
 

8519
02:12:08,639 --> 02:12:11,030
the community are the reviewers so it's
already it's like that part is there but

8520
02:12:11,030 --> 02:12:11,040
already it's like that part is there but
 

8521
02:12:11,040 --> 02:12:14,310
already it's like that part is there but
it it would be nice to have like

8522
02:12:14,310 --> 02:12:14,320
it it would be nice to have like
 

8523
02:12:14,320 --> 02:12:15,350
it it would be nice to have like
uh

8524
02:12:15,350 --> 02:12:15,360
uh
 

8525
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:17,669
uh
you know nature level like this is

8526
02:12:17,669 --> 02:12:17,679
you know nature level like this is
 

8527
02:12:17,679 --> 02:12:19,910
you know nature level like this is
respect this is a respectful

8528
02:12:19,910 --> 02:12:19,920
respect this is a respectful
 

8529
02:12:19,920 --> 02:12:22,629
respect this is a respectful
accomplishment yeah and something like a

8530
02:12:22,629 --> 02:12:22,639
accomplishment yeah and something like a
 

8531
02:12:22,639 --> 02:12:25,830
accomplishment yeah and something like a
leaderboard but a stable kind of system

8532
02:12:25,830 --> 02:12:25,840
leaderboard but a stable kind of system
 

8533
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:27,830
leaderboard but a stable kind of system
yeah and i should mention so there's a

8534
02:12:27,830 --> 02:12:27,840
yeah and i should mention so there's a
 

8535
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:29,990
yeah and i should mention so there's a
crypto angle to this too which is um so

8536
02:12:29,990 --> 02:12:30,000
crypto angle to this too which is um so
 

8537
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:31,430
crypto angle to this too which is um so
research hub has a coin associated with

8538
02:12:31,430 --> 02:12:31,440
research hub has a coin associated with
 

8539
02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:33,510
research hub has a coin associated with
research coin and it's basically if if

8540
02:12:33,510 --> 02:12:33,520
research coin and it's basically if if
 

8541
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:35,589
research coin and it's basically if if
people you know upvote your paper or

8542
02:12:35,589 --> 02:12:35,599
people you know upvote your paper or
 

8543
02:12:35,599 --> 02:12:36,310
people you know upvote your paper or
like

8544
02:12:36,310 --> 02:12:36,320
like
 

8545
02:12:36,320 --> 02:12:38,229
like
support it you'll accumulate more

8546
02:12:38,229 --> 02:12:38,239
support it you'll accumulate more
 

8547
02:12:38,239 --> 02:12:39,669
support it you'll accumulate more
research coin which is basically like

8548
02:12:39,669 --> 02:12:39,679
research coin which is basically like
 

8549
02:12:39,679 --> 02:12:42,709
research coin which is basically like
rep or like a reward token um and so

8550
02:12:42,709 --> 02:12:42,719
rep or like a reward token um and so
 

8551
02:12:42,719 --> 02:12:44,870
rep or like a reward token um and so
that is a way to um

8552
02:12:44,870 --> 02:12:44,880
that is a way to um
 

8553
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:47,030
that is a way to um
i guess measure the the community's

8554
02:12:47,030 --> 02:12:47,040
i guess measure the the community's
 

8555
02:12:47,040 --> 02:12:49,270
i guess measure the the community's
collective view of that paper

8556
02:12:49,270 --> 02:12:49,280
collective view of that paper
 

8557
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:51,430
collective view of that paper
a form of peer review um and it can even

8558
02:12:51,430 --> 02:12:51,440
a form of peer review um and it can even
 

8559
02:12:51,440 --> 02:12:53,030
a form of peer review um and it can even
be weighted by like the reputation of

8560
02:12:53,030 --> 02:12:53,040
be weighted by like the reputation of
 

8561
02:12:53,040 --> 02:12:54,470
be weighted by like the reputation of
the people voting on it and that sort of

8562
02:12:54,470 --> 02:12:54,480
the people voting on it and that sort of
 

8563
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:55,910
the people voting on it and that sort of
thing over time

8564
02:12:55,910 --> 02:12:55,920
thing over time
 

8565
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:56,870
thing over time
um

8566
02:12:56,870 --> 02:12:56,880
um
 

8567
02:12:56,880 --> 02:12:58,310
um
yeah i think the last thing i'll just

8568
02:12:58,310 --> 02:12:58,320
yeah i think the last thing i'll just
 

8569
02:12:58,320 --> 02:13:00,629
yeah i think the last thing i'll just
say is that so i think from from a rep

8570
02:13:00,629 --> 02:13:00,639
say is that so i think from from a rep
 

8571
02:13:00,639 --> 02:13:03,510
say is that so i think from from a rep
like a prestige point of view

8572
02:13:03,510 --> 02:13:03,520
like a prestige point of view
 

8573
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:05,109
like a prestige point of view
it won't start off that way it'll

8574
02:13:05,109 --> 02:13:05,119
it won't start off that way it'll
 

8575
02:13:05,119 --> 02:13:06,390
it won't start off that way it'll
probably start off like being a little

8576
02:13:06,390 --> 02:13:06,400
probably start off like being a little
 

8577
02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:08,950
probably start off like being a little
more quirky like you know like remember

8578
02:13:08,950 --> 02:13:08,960
more quirky like you know like remember
 

8579
02:13:08,960 --> 02:13:10,709
more quirky like you know like remember
when youtube first started it was like

8580
02:13:10,709 --> 02:13:10,719
when youtube first started it was like
 

8581
02:13:10,719 --> 02:13:12,550
when youtube first started it was like
people posting weird cat videos and

8582
02:13:12,550 --> 02:13:12,560
people posting weird cat videos and
 

8583
02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:14,390
people posting weird cat videos and
stuff and but now like you know if you

8584
02:13:14,390 --> 02:13:14,400
stuff and but now like you know if you
 

8585
02:13:14,400 --> 02:13:15,830
stuff and but now like you know if you
have a million subscribers on youtube

8586
02:13:15,830 --> 02:13:15,840
have a million subscribers on youtube
 

8587
02:13:15,840 --> 02:13:17,030
have a million subscribers on youtube
that's probably better than getting like

8588
02:13:17,030 --> 02:13:17,040
that's probably better than getting like
 

8589
02:13:17,040 --> 02:13:18,870
that's probably better than getting like
a tv show on nbc or whoever the

8590
02:13:18,870 --> 02:13:18,880
a tv show on nbc or whoever the
 

8591
02:13:18,880 --> 02:13:20,870
a tv show on nbc or whoever the
traditional gatekeeper was

8592
02:13:20,870 --> 02:13:20,880
traditional gatekeeper was
 

8593
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:22,790
traditional gatekeeper was
so my hope it might take 10 years 20

8594
02:13:22,790 --> 02:13:22,800
so my hope it might take 10 years 20
 

8595
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:24,870
so my hope it might take 10 years 20
years whatever but i'm hoping that

8596
02:13:24,870 --> 02:13:24,880
years whatever but i'm hoping that
 

8597
02:13:24,880 --> 02:13:27,510
years whatever but i'm hoping that
this can sort of be the new prestigious

8598
02:13:27,510 --> 02:13:27,520
this can sort of be the new prestigious
 

8599
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:29,430
this can sort of be the new prestigious
way that that young people publish in

8600
02:13:29,430 --> 02:13:29,440
way that that young people publish in
 

8601
02:13:29,440 --> 02:13:31,350
way that that young people publish in
science and it'll become to be viewed as

8602
02:13:31,350 --> 02:13:31,360
science and it'll become to be viewed as
 

8603
02:13:31,360 --> 02:13:32,870
science and it'll become to be viewed as
more prestigious the the journals

8604
02:13:32,870 --> 02:13:32,880
more prestigious the the journals
 

8605
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:34,950
more prestigious the the journals
nutritional journals will be viewed as

8606
02:13:34,950 --> 02:13:34,960
nutritional journals will be viewed as
 

8607
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:36,709
nutritional journals will be viewed as
old-fashioned well

8608
02:13:36,709 --> 02:13:36,719
old-fashioned well
 

8609
02:13:36,719 --> 02:13:38,709
old-fashioned well
it's definitely a

8610
02:13:38,709 --> 02:13:38,719
it's definitely a
 

8611
02:13:38,719 --> 02:13:41,430
it's definitely a
system that could do a lot better and

8612
02:13:41,430 --> 02:13:41,440
system that could do a lot better and
 

8613
02:13:41,440 --> 02:13:42,950
system that could do a lot better and
there's a lot of incredible brilliant

8614
02:13:42,950 --> 02:13:42,960
there's a lot of incredible brilliant
 

8615
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:44,470
there's a lot of incredible brilliant
people doing science

8616
02:13:44,470 --> 02:13:44,480
people doing science
 

8617
02:13:44,480 --> 02:13:46,629
people doing science
they deserve better the better platforms

8618
02:13:46,629 --> 02:13:46,639
they deserve better the better platforms
 

8619
02:13:46,639 --> 02:13:49,270
they deserve better the better platforms
yeah uh so another thing you're taking

8620
02:13:49,270 --> 02:13:49,280
yeah uh so another thing you're taking
 

8621
02:13:49,280 --> 02:13:50,790
yeah uh so another thing you're taking
on and helping out with is this new

8622
02:13:50,790 --> 02:13:50,800
on and helping out with is this new
 

8623
02:13:50,800 --> 02:13:53,750
on and helping out with is this new
limit which is looking at longevity yeah

8624
02:13:53,750 --> 02:13:53,760
limit which is looking at longevity yeah
 

8625
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:55,510
limit which is looking at longevity yeah
what's what's the idea there

8626
02:13:55,510 --> 02:13:55,520
what's what's the idea there
 

8627
02:13:55,520 --> 02:13:57,270
what's what's the idea there
yeah okay so as you can see i'm excited

8628
02:13:57,270 --> 02:13:57,280
yeah okay so as you can see i'm excited
 

8629
02:13:57,280 --> 02:13:59,189
yeah okay so as you can see i'm excited
about science like i think you know

8630
02:13:59,189 --> 02:13:59,199
about science like i think you know
 

8631
02:13:59,199 --> 02:14:00,950
about science like i think you know
science is sort of the

8632
02:14:00,950 --> 02:14:00,960
science is sort of the
 

8633
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:02,550
science is sort of the
basically if you get scientific

8634
02:14:02,550 --> 02:14:02,560
basically if you get scientific
 

8635
02:14:02,560 --> 02:14:05,109
basically if you get scientific
innovation then you get um better

8636
02:14:05,109 --> 02:14:05,119
innovation then you get um better
 

8637
02:14:05,119 --> 02:14:06,629
innovation then you get um better
products and you get better economic

8638
02:14:06,629 --> 02:14:06,639
products and you get better economic
 

8639
02:14:06,639 --> 02:14:08,229
products and you get better economic
growth and then you get

8640
02:14:08,229 --> 02:14:08,239
growth and then you get
 

8641
02:14:08,239 --> 02:14:10,149
growth and then you get
all kinds of like surplus in society

8642
02:14:10,149 --> 02:14:10,159
all kinds of like surplus in society
 

8643
02:14:10,159 --> 02:14:12,470
all kinds of like surplus in society
that can go to arts and philosophy and

8644
02:14:12,470 --> 02:14:12,480
that can go to arts and philosophy and
 

8645
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:14,310
that can go to arts and philosophy and
like all kinds of stuff but

8646
02:14:14,310 --> 02:14:14,320
like all kinds of stuff but
 

8647
02:14:14,320 --> 02:14:17,510
like all kinds of stuff but
um with new limits so yeah i kind of got

8648
02:14:17,510 --> 02:14:17,520
um with new limits so yeah i kind of got
 

8649
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:18,709
um with new limits so yeah i kind of got
i started hosting some dinners with

8650
02:14:18,709 --> 02:14:18,719
i started hosting some dinners with
 

8651
02:14:18,719 --> 02:14:20,390
i started hosting some dinners with
scientists um

8652
02:14:20,390 --> 02:14:20,400
scientists um
 

8653
02:14:20,400 --> 02:14:22,069
scientists um
last year and i was

8654
02:14:22,069 --> 02:14:22,079
last year and i was
 

8655
02:14:22,079 --> 02:14:23,189
last year and i was
learning about all kinds of the latest

8656
02:14:23,189 --> 02:14:23,199
learning about all kinds of the latest
 

8657
02:14:23,199 --> 02:14:25,350
learning about all kinds of the latest
stuff happening in bio and there's a lot

8658
02:14:25,350 --> 02:14:25,360
stuff happening in bio and there's a lot
 

8659
02:14:25,360 --> 02:14:26,950
stuff happening in bio and there's a lot
of really cool stuff happening with like

8660
02:14:26,950 --> 02:14:26,960
of really cool stuff happening with like
 

8661
02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:28,550
of really cool stuff happening with like
car t cells and crispr and all these

8662
02:14:28,550 --> 02:14:28,560
car t cells and crispr and all these
 

8663
02:14:28,560 --> 02:14:31,109
car t cells and crispr and all these
things and um anyway one of the

8664
02:14:31,109 --> 02:14:31,119
things and um anyway one of the
 

8665
02:14:31,119 --> 02:14:32,390
things and um anyway one of the
topics that i started to learn more

8666
02:14:32,390 --> 02:14:32,400
topics that i started to learn more
 

8667
02:14:32,400 --> 02:14:33,910
topics that i started to learn more
about was um something called cell

8668
02:14:33,910 --> 02:14:33,920
about was um something called cell
 

8669
02:14:33,920 --> 02:14:36,310
about was um something called cell
reprogramming and you know

8670
02:14:36,310 --> 02:14:36,320
reprogramming and you know
 

8671
02:14:36,320 --> 02:14:38,470
reprogramming and you know
people maybe have heard of this

8672
02:14:38,470 --> 02:14:38,480
people maybe have heard of this
 

8673
02:14:38,480 --> 02:14:40,149
people maybe have heard of this
induced pluripotent stem cells where you

8674
02:14:40,149 --> 02:14:40,159
induced pluripotent stem cells where you
 

8675
02:14:40,159 --> 02:14:41,589
induced pluripotent stem cells where you
could take like a skin cell and turn it

8676
02:14:41,589 --> 02:14:41,599
could take like a skin cell and turn it
 

8677
02:14:41,599 --> 02:14:43,189
could take like a skin cell and turn it
back into a stem cell

8678
02:14:43,189 --> 02:14:43,199
back into a stem cell
 

8679
02:14:43,199 --> 02:14:45,430
back into a stem cell
and um shinya yamanaka won the nobel

8680
02:14:45,430 --> 02:14:45,440
and um shinya yamanaka won the nobel
 

8681
02:14:45,440 --> 02:14:47,510
and um shinya yamanaka won the nobel
prize for this work that was done in

8682
02:14:47,510 --> 02:14:47,520
prize for this work that was done in
 

8683
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:48,870
prize for this work that was done in
2006

8684
02:14:48,870 --> 02:14:48,880
2006
 

8685
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:50,470
2006
and um

8686
02:14:50,470 --> 02:14:50,480
and um
 

8687
02:14:50,480 --> 02:14:51,750
and um
you know it's kind of a crazy thing you

8688
02:14:51,750 --> 02:14:51,760
you know it's kind of a crazy thing you
 

8689
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:53,589
you know it's kind of a crazy thing you
can turn one cell into another another

8690
02:14:53,589 --> 02:14:53,599
can turn one cell into another another
 

8691
02:14:53,599 --> 02:14:54,950
can turn one cell into another another
type of cell well

8692
02:14:54,950 --> 02:14:54,960
type of cell well
 

8693
02:14:54,960 --> 02:14:57,270
type of cell well
people recently have been

8694
02:14:57,270 --> 02:14:57,280
people recently have been
 

8695
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:59,589
people recently have been
experimenting with um different types of

8696
02:14:59,589 --> 02:14:59,599
experimenting with um different types of
 

8697
02:14:59,599 --> 02:15:01,910
experimenting with um different types of
transcription factors that

8698
02:15:01,910 --> 02:15:01,920
transcription factors that
 

8699
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:03,430
transcription factors that
would either not you don't want the cell

8700
02:15:03,430 --> 02:15:03,440
would either not you don't want the cell
 

8701
02:15:03,440 --> 02:15:04,470
would either not you don't want the cell
to go all the way back to being a stem

8702
02:15:04,470 --> 02:15:04,480
to go all the way back to being a stem
 

8703
02:15:04,480 --> 02:15:06,470
to go all the way back to being a stem
cell um you can end up getting like

8704
02:15:06,470 --> 02:15:06,480
cell um you can end up getting like
 

8705
02:15:06,480 --> 02:15:08,069
cell um you can end up getting like
cancerous cells and things like that but

8706
02:15:08,069 --> 02:15:08,079
cancerous cells and things like that but
 

8707
02:15:08,079 --> 02:15:09,830
cancerous cells and things like that but
you want it basically to the cell to

8708
02:15:09,830 --> 02:15:09,840
you want it basically to the cell to
 

8709
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:12,790
you want it basically to the cell to
revert a little bit um earlier in its

8710
02:15:12,790 --> 02:15:12,800
revert a little bit um earlier in its
 

8711
02:15:12,800 --> 02:15:14,310
revert a little bit um earlier in its
you know it would call it the waddington

8712
02:15:14,310 --> 02:15:14,320
you know it would call it the waddington
 

8713
02:15:14,320 --> 02:15:16,870
you know it would call it the waddington
landscape but it's basically like um go

8714
02:15:16,870 --> 02:15:16,880
landscape but it's basically like um go
 

8715
02:15:16,880 --> 02:15:18,390
landscape but it's basically like um go
become act start to act like a bit of a

8716
02:15:18,390 --> 02:15:18,400
become act start to act like a bit of a
 

8717
02:15:18,400 --> 02:15:20,390
become act start to act like a bit of a
younger cell but not to to

8718
02:15:20,390 --> 02:15:20,400
younger cell but not to to
 

8719
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:22,069
younger cell but not to to
de-differentiate and become more like a

8720
02:15:22,069 --> 02:15:22,079
de-differentiate and become more like a
 

8721
02:15:22,079 --> 02:15:24,790
de-differentiate and become more like a
stem cell and so i decided this might be

8722
02:15:24,790 --> 02:15:24,800
stem cell and so i decided this might be
 

8723
02:15:24,800 --> 02:15:26,790
stem cell and so i decided this might be
an interesting area to go fund

8724
02:15:26,790 --> 02:15:26,800
an interesting area to go fund
 

8725
02:15:26,800 --> 02:15:28,709
an interesting area to go fund
i think that that team has come together

8726
02:15:28,709 --> 02:15:28,719
i think that that team has come together
 

8727
02:15:28,719 --> 02:15:30,629
i think that that team has come together
there's like some really talented people

8728
02:15:30,629 --> 02:15:30,639
there's like some really talented people
 

8729
02:15:30,639 --> 02:15:31,910
there's like some really talented people
who've come together to help get that

8730
02:15:31,910 --> 02:15:31,920
who've come together to help get that
 

8731
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:33,669
who've come together to help get that
off the ground and they're basically

8732
02:15:33,669 --> 02:15:33,679
off the ground and they're basically
 

8733
02:15:33,679 --> 02:15:35,189
off the ground and they're basically
building a

8734
02:15:35,189 --> 02:15:35,199
building a
 

8735
02:15:35,199 --> 02:15:37,270
building a
a platform that can test a lot of

8736
02:15:37,270 --> 02:15:37,280
a platform that can test a lot of
 

8737
02:15:37,280 --> 02:15:38,790
a platform that can test a lot of
different transcription factors on

8738
02:15:38,790 --> 02:15:38,800
different transcription factors on
 

8739
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:40,950
different transcription factors on
different cell types and hopefully find

8740
02:15:40,950 --> 02:15:40,960
different cell types and hopefully find
 

8741
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:43,030
different cell types and hopefully find
ways to rejuvenate different types of

8742
02:15:43,030 --> 02:15:43,040
ways to rejuvenate different types of
 

8743
02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:45,030
ways to rejuvenate different types of
cells and tissues to extend human health

8744
02:15:45,030 --> 02:15:45,040
cells and tissues to extend human health
 

8745
02:15:45,040 --> 02:15:47,430
cells and tissues to extend human health
span i mean the moonshot goal here you

8746
02:15:47,430 --> 02:15:47,440
span i mean the moonshot goal here you
 

8747
02:15:47,440 --> 02:15:48,950
span i mean the moonshot goal here you
know the get to mars

8748
02:15:48,950 --> 02:15:48,960
know the get to mars
 

8749
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:51,270
know the get to mars
is um that there could be some therapy

8750
02:15:51,270 --> 02:15:51,280
is um that there could be some therapy
 

8751
02:15:51,280 --> 02:15:53,589
is um that there could be some therapy
here that in i don't know 10 or 20 years

8752
02:15:53,589 --> 02:15:53,599
here that in i don't know 10 or 20 years
 

8753
02:15:53,599 --> 02:15:55,030
here that in i don't know 10 or 20 years
that you take and from a whole body

8754
02:15:55,030 --> 02:15:55,040
that you take and from a whole body
 

8755
02:15:55,040 --> 02:15:56,709
that you take and from a whole body
point of view um it's sort of

8756
02:15:56,709 --> 02:15:56,719
point of view um it's sort of
 

8757
02:15:56,719 --> 02:15:59,350
point of view um it's sort of
rejuvenating tissue not just one type of

8758
02:15:59,350 --> 02:15:59,360
rejuvenating tissue not just one type of
 

8759
02:15:59,360 --> 02:16:00,709
rejuvenating tissue not just one type of
tissue like your immune system but

8760
02:16:00,709 --> 02:16:00,719
tissue like your immune system but
 

8761
02:16:00,719 --> 02:16:01,990
tissue like your immune system but
eventually your whole body maybe even

8762
02:16:01,990 --> 02:16:02,000
eventually your whole body maybe even
 

8763
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:03,510
eventually your whole body maybe even
your brain so that

8764
02:16:03,510 --> 02:16:03,520
your brain so that
 

8765
02:16:03,520 --> 02:16:04,870
your brain so that
you know we don't have that issue where

8766
02:16:04,870 --> 02:16:04,880
you know we don't have that issue where
 

8767
02:16:04,880 --> 02:16:05,990
you know we don't have that issue where
people who are older have trouble

8768
02:16:05,990 --> 02:16:06,000
people who are older have trouble
 

8769
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:07,669
people who are older have trouble
learning or they're more ossified in

8770
02:16:07,669 --> 02:16:07,679
learning or they're more ossified in
 

8771
02:16:07,679 --> 02:16:08,790
learning or they're more ossified in
their thinking

8772
02:16:08,790 --> 02:16:08,800
their thinking
 

8773
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:09,830
their thinking
um

8774
02:16:09,830 --> 02:16:09,840
um
 

8775
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:13,189
um
to me this is just i always think about

8776
02:16:13,189 --> 02:16:13,199
to me this is just i always think about
 

8777
02:16:13,199 --> 02:16:14,470
to me this is just i always think about
you know it's it's actually a little

8778
02:16:14,470 --> 02:16:14,480
you know it's it's actually a little
 

8779
02:16:14,480 --> 02:16:16,310
you know it's it's actually a little
inspired by elon right it's like what

8780
02:16:16,310 --> 02:16:16,320
inspired by elon right it's like what
 

8781
02:16:16,320 --> 02:16:17,669
inspired by elon right it's like what
are some of the biggest things in the

8782
02:16:17,669 --> 02:16:17,679
are some of the biggest things in the
 

8783
02:16:17,679 --> 02:16:19,430
are some of the biggest things in the
world like that are probably high

8784
02:16:19,430 --> 02:16:19,440
world like that are probably high
 

8785
02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:21,350
world like that are probably high
technology risk but if they did work

8786
02:16:21,350 --> 02:16:21,360
technology risk but if they did work
 

8787
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:22,950
technology risk but if they did work
maybe they're they're kind of low chance

8788
02:16:22,950 --> 02:16:22,960
maybe they're they're kind of low chance
 

8789
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:24,310
maybe they're they're kind of low chance
of working but if they did work would

8790
02:16:24,310 --> 02:16:24,320
of working but if they did work would
 

8791
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:26,550
of working but if they did work would
have enormous impact i like the idea of

8792
02:16:26,550 --> 02:16:26,560
have enormous impact i like the idea of
 

8793
02:16:26,560 --> 02:16:29,350
have enormous impact i like the idea of
trying hard tech problems especially

8794
02:16:29,350 --> 02:16:29,360
trying hard tech problems especially
 

8795
02:16:29,360 --> 02:16:30,950
trying hard tech problems especially
for people like founders like me who've

8796
02:16:30,950 --> 02:16:30,960
for people like founders like me who've
 

8797
02:16:30,960 --> 02:16:32,549
for people like founders like me who've
made some money in software which i

8798
02:16:32,549 --> 02:16:32,559
made some money in software which i
 

8799
02:16:32,559 --> 02:16:34,070
made some money in software which i
think we're in kind of like a golden age

8800
02:16:34,070 --> 02:16:34,080
think we're in kind of like a golden age
 

8801
02:16:34,080 --> 02:16:35,589
think we're in kind of like a golden age
of software so there's like fortunes to

8802
02:16:35,589 --> 02:16:35,599
of software so there's like fortunes to
 

8803
02:16:35,599 --> 02:16:37,910
of software so there's like fortunes to
be made but if you if you do make some

8804
02:16:37,910 --> 02:16:37,920
be made but if you if you do make some
 

8805
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:39,669
be made but if you if you do make some
money in that my hope is people will

8806
02:16:39,669 --> 02:16:39,679
money in that my hope is people will
 

8807
02:16:39,679 --> 02:16:40,870
money in that my hope is people will
like

8808
02:16:40,870 --> 02:16:40,880
like
 

8809
02:16:40,880 --> 02:16:43,190
like
do atoms not bits you know and try some

8810
02:16:43,190 --> 02:16:43,200
do atoms not bits you know and try some
 

8811
02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:46,549
do atoms not bits you know and try some
of the harder things like in biotech or

8812
02:16:46,549 --> 02:16:46,559
of the harder things like in biotech or
 

8813
02:16:46,559 --> 02:16:47,589
of the harder things like in biotech or
you know i guess he's doing cars and

8814
02:16:47,589 --> 02:16:47,599
you know i guess he's doing cars and
 

8815
02:16:47,599 --> 02:16:49,110
you know i guess he's doing cars and
rockets and stuff but

8816
02:16:49,110 --> 02:16:49,120
rockets and stuff but
 

8817
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:51,750
rockets and stuff but
anyway it i think we should try hard

8818
02:16:51,750 --> 02:16:51,760
anyway it i think we should try hard
 

8819
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:53,589
anyway it i think we should try hard
hard tech or you know physical science

8820
02:16:53,589 --> 02:16:53,599
hard tech or you know physical science
 

8821
02:16:53,599 --> 02:16:55,830
hard tech or you know physical science
problems as well and see if that can

8822
02:16:55,830 --> 02:16:55,840
problems as well and see if that can
 

8823
02:16:55,840 --> 02:16:56,790
problems as well and see if that can
advance

8824
02:16:56,790 --> 02:16:56,800
advance
 

8825
02:16:56,800 --> 02:16:58,070
advance
for team human

8826
02:16:58,070 --> 02:16:58,080
for team human
 

8827
02:16:58,080 --> 02:17:01,110
for team human
yeah so he's also doing bio with

8828
02:17:01,110 --> 02:17:01,120
yeah so he's also doing bio with
 

8829
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:02,389
yeah so he's also doing bio with
neuralink

8830
02:17:02,389 --> 02:17:02,399
neuralink
 

8831
02:17:02,399 --> 02:17:06,070
neuralink
yeah and i feel like bio is tough yeah

8832
02:17:06,070 --> 02:17:06,080
yeah and i feel like bio is tough yeah
 

8833
02:17:06,080 --> 02:17:07,750
yeah and i feel like bio is tough yeah
because it's messy we don't understand

8834
02:17:07,750 --> 02:17:07,760
because it's messy we don't understand
 

8835
02:17:07,760 --> 02:17:09,509
because it's messy we don't understand
it as well we don't understand it the

8836
02:17:09,509 --> 02:17:09,519
it as well we don't understand it the
 

8837
02:17:09,519 --> 02:17:11,429
it as well we don't understand it the
risk is higher

8838
02:17:11,429 --> 02:17:11,439
risk is higher
 

8839
02:17:11,439 --> 02:17:14,070
risk is higher
in terms of uh not the risk is higher

8840
02:17:14,070 --> 02:17:14,080
in terms of uh not the risk is higher
 

8841
02:17:14,080 --> 02:17:16,070
in terms of uh not the risk is higher
but like you have to deal with

8842
02:17:16,070 --> 02:17:16,080
but like you have to deal with
 

8843
02:17:16,080 --> 02:17:19,830
but like you have to deal with
uh the actual sort of um to get to human

8844
02:17:19,830 --> 02:17:19,840
uh the actual sort of um to get to human
 

8845
02:17:19,840 --> 02:17:22,629
uh the actual sort of um to get to human
to get to stuff where it could be uh

8846
02:17:22,629 --> 02:17:22,639
to get to stuff where it could be uh
 

8847
02:17:22,639 --> 02:17:25,110
to get to stuff where it could be uh
therapies for actual human bodies

8848
02:17:25,110 --> 02:17:25,120

um
 

8851
02:17:26,880 --> 02:17:28,870
um
is is tricky because you have to prove

8852
02:17:28,870 --> 02:17:28,880
is is tricky because you have to prove
 

8853
02:17:28,880 --> 02:17:30,389
is is tricky because you have to prove
that it's safe it's effective all those

8854
02:17:30,389 --> 02:17:30,399
that it's safe it's effective all those
 

8855
02:17:30,399 --> 02:17:33,669
that it's safe it's effective all those
kinds of things with uh with fda i mean

tell we are just some organic molecules
 

9247
02:23:26,800 --> 02:23:29,190

in the ocean started like dividing and

9248
02:23:29,190 --> 02:23:29,200
in the ocean started like dividing and
 

9249
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:31,830
in the ocean started like dividing and
replicating and the selfish gene and all

9250
02:23:31,830 --> 02:23:31,840
replicating and the selfish gene and all
 

9251
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:34,389
replicating and the selfish gene and all
this stuff like basically ended up here

9252
02:23:34,389 --> 02:23:34,399
this stuff like basically ended up here
 

9253
02:23:34,399 --> 02:23:36,389
this stuff like basically ended up here
and our only it's it's some kind of like

9254
02:23:36,389 --> 02:23:36,399
and our only it's it's some kind of like
 

9255
02:23:36,399 --> 02:23:38,469
and our only it's it's some kind of like
really naive algorithm that's just kind

9256
02:23:38,469 --> 02:23:38,479
really naive algorithm that's just kind
 

9257
02:23:38,479 --> 02:23:40,230
really naive algorithm that's just kind
of trying to get us to survive and

9258
02:23:40,230 --> 02:23:40,240
of trying to get us to survive and
 

9259
02:23:40,240 --> 02:23:42,230
of trying to get us to survive and
replicate and we have dna just like

9260
02:23:42,230 --> 02:23:42,240
replicate and we have dna just like
 

9261
02:23:42,240 --> 02:23:44,389
replicate and we have dna just like
every other animal and so we and we

9262
02:23:44,389 --> 02:23:44,399
every other animal and so we and we
 

9263
02:23:44,399 --> 02:23:45,830
every other animal and so we and we
happen to develop these like really cool

9264
02:23:45,830 --> 02:23:45,840
happen to develop these like really cool
 

9265
02:23:45,840 --> 02:23:47,670
happen to develop these like really cool
neocortexes and so now we're sort of

9266
02:23:47,670 --> 02:23:47,680
neocortexes and so now we're sort of
 

9267
02:23:47,680 --> 02:23:49,349
neocortexes and so now we're sort of
self-aware and we have all these big

9268
02:23:49,349 --> 02:23:49,359
self-aware and we have all these big
 

9269
02:23:49,359 --> 02:23:50,790
self-aware and we have all these big
questions

9270
02:23:50,790 --> 02:23:50,800
questions
 

9271
02:23:50,800 --> 02:23:51,910
questions
and maybe

9272
02:23:51,910 --> 02:23:51,920
and maybe
 

9273
02:23:51,920 --> 02:23:54,070
and maybe
maybe we'll create another you know as

9274
02:23:54,070 --> 02:23:54,080
maybe we'll create another you know as
 

9275
02:23:54,080 --> 02:23:55,349
maybe we'll create another you know as
computers get better we'll create the

9276
02:23:55,349 --> 02:23:55,359
computers get better we'll create the
 

9277
02:23:55,359 --> 02:23:57,590
computers get better we'll create the
simulation inside our thing and

9278
02:23:57,590 --> 02:23:57,600
simulation inside our thing and
 

9279
02:23:57,600 --> 02:23:59,110
simulation inside our thing and
um i think it's cool like we should

9280
02:23:59,110 --> 02:23:59,120
um i think it's cool like we should
 

9281
02:23:59,120 --> 02:24:00,790
um i think it's cool like we should
basically i just want to keep watching

why i want to work on um like new limit

9286
02:24:05,190 --> 02:24:05,200
why i want to work on um like new limit
 

9287
02:24:05,200 --> 02:24:06,550
why i want to work on um like new limit
is really cool because it's help if

9288
02:24:06,550 --> 02:24:06,560
is really cool because it's help if
 

9289
02:24:06,560 --> 02:24:08,790
is really cool because it's help if
people can live longer whether that's

9290
02:24:08,790 --> 02:24:08,800
people can live longer whether that's
 

9291
02:24:08,800 --> 02:24:11,429
people can live longer whether that's
uploading their brain to the cloud or

9292
02:24:11,429 --> 02:24:11,439
uploading their brain to the cloud or
 

9293
02:24:11,439 --> 02:24:13,349
uploading their brain to the cloud or
um you know basically through we get

9294
02:24:13,349 --> 02:24:13,359
um you know basically through we get
 

9295
02:24:13,359 --> 02:24:15,990
um you know basically through we get
biology to work or the strong ai to work

9296
02:24:15,990 --> 02:24:16,000
biology to work or the strong ai to work
 

9297
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:17,990
biology to work or the strong ai to work
or whatever one of those two hopefully

9298
02:24:17,990 --> 02:24:18,000
or whatever one of those two hopefully
 

9299
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:19,750
or whatever one of those two hopefully
works out and then we get to we get to

9300
02:24:19,750 --> 02:24:19,760
works out and then we get to we get to
 

9301
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:20,950
works out and then we get to we get to
keep watching the movie and see how it

anyway
 

9449
02:26:26,160 --> 02:26:29,750
anyway
you you know i think like within

9450
02:26:29,750 --> 02:26:29,760
you you know i think like within
 

9451
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:31,429
you you know i think like within
seven years

9452
02:26:31,429 --> 02:26:31,439
seven years
 

9453
02:26:31,439 --> 02:26:33,110
seven years
uh no it's probably more like 10 years

9454
02:26:33,110 --> 02:26:33,120
uh no it's probably more like 10 years
 

9455
02:26:33,120 --> 02:26:35,429
uh no it's probably more like 10 years
of me writing that goal down

9456
02:26:35,429 --> 02:26:35,439
of me writing that goal down
 

9457
02:26:35,439 --> 02:26:37,190
of me writing that goal down
um coinbase had a valuation over a

9458
02:26:37,190 --> 02:26:37,200
um coinbase had a valuation over a
 

9459
02:26:37,200 --> 02:26:38,710
um coinbase had a valuation over a
billion dollars

9460
02:26:38,710 --> 02:26:38,720
billion dollars
 

9461
02:26:38,720 --> 02:26:39,750
billion dollars
so it

9462
02:26:39,750 --> 02:26:39,760
so it
 

9463
02:26:39,760 --> 02:26:41,590
so it
it was out of my realm of what was even

9464
02:26:41,590 --> 02:26:41,600
it was out of my realm of what was even
 

9465
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:42,790
it was out of my realm of what was even
possible

9466
02:26:42,790 --> 02:26:42,800
possible
 

9467
02:26:42,800 --> 02:26:43,670
possible
and then

9468
02:26:43,670 --> 02:26:43,680
and then
 

9469
02:26:43,680 --> 02:26:45,030
and then
within 10 years you can you can

9470
02:26:45,030 --> 02:26:45,040
within 10 years you can you can
 

9471
02:26:45,040 --> 02:26:46,309
within 10 years you can you can
accomplish more in 10 years than you

9472
02:26:46,309 --> 02:26:46,319
accomplish more in 10 years than you
 

9473
02:26:46,319 --> 02:26:48,309
accomplish more in 10 years than you
think less than in a year than you think
