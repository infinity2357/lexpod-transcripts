I'm sure if Mei was the idea but it's

I'm sure if Mei was the idea but it's

I'm sure if Mei was the idea but it's
the idea that if you were to build

108
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:18,340

general AI problem-solving algorithms
 

111
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,600
general AI problem-solving algorithms
well the problem of building such an AI

112
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:25,610
well the problem of building such an AI
 

113
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,380
well the problem of building such an AI
that itself is a problem that could be

114
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:29,390
that itself is a problem that could be
 

115
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,240
that itself is a problem that could be
solved by your eye and maybe it could be

116
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,250
solved by your eye and maybe it could be
 

117
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,190
solved by your eye and maybe it could be
so better than that then what humans can

118
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,200
so better than that then what humans can
 

119
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,800
so better than that then what humans can
do so you're a I could start tweaking

120
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:35,810
do so you're a I could start tweaking
 

121
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,750
do so you're a I could start tweaking
its own algorithm good that start being

00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,760
its own algorithm good that start being
 

123
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,810
its own algorithm good that start being
a better version of itself and so on

124
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:40,820
a better version of itself and so on
 

125
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,390
a better version of itself and so on
it's ratified in a recursive fashion and

126
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:43,400
it's ratified in a recursive fashion and
 

127
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,730
it's ratified in a recursive fashion and
so you would end up with an AI with

128
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:47,740
so you would end up with an AI with
 

129
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,390
so you would end up with an AI with
exponentially increasing intelligence

130
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:49,400
exponentially increasing intelligence
 

131
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,270
exponentially increasing intelligence
all right and I was basically

132
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:54,280
all right and I was basically
 

133
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,410
all right and I was basically
questioning this idea first of all

134
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:56,420
questioning this idea first of all
 

135
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,570
questioning this idea first of all
because the notion of intelligence

136
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:58,580
because the notion of intelligence
 

137
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,390
because the notion of intelligence
explosion uses an implicit definition of

138
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:01,400
explosion uses an implicit definition of
 

139
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,370
explosion uses an implicit definition of
intelligence that doesn't sound quite

140
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:03,380
intelligence that doesn't sound quite
 

141
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:09,210
intelligence that doesn't sound quite
right to me it considers intelligence as

142
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:09,220

 

143
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,640

property of a grain that you can

144
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:11,650
property of a grain that you can
 

145
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,490
property of a grain that you can
consider in isolation like the height of

146
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:14,500
consider in isolation like the height of
 

147
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,830
consider in isolation like the height of
the building for instance right but

148
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:16,840
the building for instance right but
 

149
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,660
the building for instance right but
that's not really what intelligence is

150
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:18,670
that's not really what intelligence is
 

151
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,600
that's not really what intelligence is
intelligence emerges from the

152
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:21,610
intelligence emerges from the
 

153
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,380
intelligence emerges from the
interaction between a brain a body like

154
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:25,390
interaction between a brain a body like
 

155
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,720
interaction between a brain a body like
embodied intelligence and an environment

156
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:27,730
embodied intelligence and an environment
 

157
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,700
embodied intelligence and an environment
and if you're missing one of these

158
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:29,710
and if you're missing one of these
 

159
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,220
and if you're missing one of these
pieces then you can actually define

160
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:32,230
pieces then you can actually define
 

161
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,400
pieces then you can actually define
interagency so just tweaking a brain to

162
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:35,410
interagency so just tweaking a brain to
 

163
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,170
interagency so just tweaking a brain to
make it smaller and smaller doesn't

164
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:37,180

an information processing system so
what's the theoretical limit like it

what's the theoretical limit like it
 

183
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,400
what's the theoretical limit like it
doesn't make sense that there should be

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,300
this information processing system and
then if you just scale it if you're able

00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:18,310
then if you just scale it if you're able
 

197
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,979
then if you just scale it if you're able
to build something that's on par with

00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,390
you're trying to make so most people who

00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:44,470
doesn't their thought process this
 

217
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,690
doesn't their thought process this
doesn't feel right

doesn't feel right
 

219
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,510
doesn't feel right
like that's for me as well so I'm more

00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:48,520
like that's for me as well so I'm more
 

221
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,990
like that's for me as well so I'm more
like it doesn't we the whole thing is

222
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,000
like it doesn't we the whole thing is
 

223
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,270
like it doesn't we the whole thing is
shrouded in mystery where you you can't

00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:54,280
shrouded in mystery where you you can't
 

225
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,070
shrouded in mystery where you you can't
really say anything concrete but you

226
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,080
really say anything concrete but you
 

227
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,990
really say anything concrete but you
could say this doesn't feel right this

228
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
could say this doesn't feel right this
 

229
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,090
could say this doesn't feel right this
doesn't feel like that's how the brain

230
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:00,100
doesn't feel like that's how the brain
 

231
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,770
doesn't feel like that's how the brain
works and you're trying to with your

232
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:01,780
works and you're trying to with your
 

233
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,290
works and you're trying to with your
blog post and now making a little more

234
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:04,300
blog post and now making a little more
 

235
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,510
blog post and now making a little more
explicit so one idea is that the brain

236
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:08,520
explicit so one idea is that the brain
 

237
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,240
explicit so one idea is that the brain
isn't exists alone it exists within the

238
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,250
isn't exists alone it exists within the
 

239
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,960
isn't exists alone it exists within the
environment so you can't exponentially

240
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:15,970
environment so you can't exponentially
 

241
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,150
environment so you can't exponentially
you have to somehow exponentially

242
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
you have to somehow exponentially
 

243
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,860
you have to somehow exponentially
improve the environment and the brain

244
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:19,870
improve the environment and the brain
 

245
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,890
improve the environment and the brain
together almost yeah in order to create

246
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:22,900
together almost yeah in order to create
 

247
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,999
together almost yeah in order to create
something that's much smarter in some

248
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:27,009
something that's much smarter in some
 

249
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:29,159
something that's much smarter in some
kind of of course we don't have a

250
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:29,169
kind of of course we don't have a
 

251
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:31,020
kind of of course we don't have a
definition of intelligence that's right

252
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,030
definition of intelligence that's right
 

253
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:31,770
definition of intelligence that's right
that's correct

254
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:31,780
that's correct
 

255
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,900
that's correct

00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:58,840
we can think of the world earth but also
 

325
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,070
we can think of the world earth but also
the universe is just as the space of

326
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
the universe is just as the space of
 

327
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,110
the universe is just as the space of
problems so all these problems and tasks

328
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:04,120
problems so all these problems and tasks
 

329
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,710
problems so all these problems and tasks
are roaming it a various difficulty and

330
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:06,720
are roaming it a various difficulty and
 

331
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,080
are roaming it a various difficulty and
there's agents creatures like ourselves

332
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,090
there's agents creatures like ourselves
 

333
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,790
there's agents creatures like ourselves
and animals and so on that are also

334
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:11,800
and animals and so on that are also
 

335
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,120
and animals and so on that are also
roaming it and then you get coupled with

336
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,130
roaming it and then you get coupled with
 

337
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,760
roaming it and then you get coupled with
a problem and then you solve it but

338
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:17,770
a problem and then you solve it but
 

339
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,980
a problem and then you solve it but
without that coupling

340
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:18,990
without that coupling
 

341
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,480
without that coupling
you can't demonstrate your quote-unquote

342
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:21,490
you can't demonstrate your quote-unquote
 

343
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,939
you can't demonstrate your quote-unquote
intelligence exactly intelligence is the

344
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:23,949
intelligence exactly intelligence is the
 

345
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:26,550
intelligence exactly intelligence is the
meaning of great problem-solving

346
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:26,560
meaning of great problem-solving
 

347
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,040
meaning of great problem-solving
capabilities with a great problem and if

348
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,050
capabilities with a great problem and if
 

349
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,839
capabilities with a great problem and if
you don't have the problem you don't

350
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:30,849
you don't have the problem you don't
 

351
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:32,820
you don't have the problem you don't
react spreche in intelligence all you're

352
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:32,830
react spreche in intelligence all you're
 

353
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,890
react spreche in intelligence all you're
left with is potential intelligence like

354
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:34,900
left with is potential intelligence like
 

355
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,420
left with is potential intelligence like
the performance of your brain are you

356
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:36,430
the performance of your brain are you
 

357
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:36,780
the performance of your brain are you
know

358
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:36,790
know
 

359
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:40,440
know
haha your IQ is which in itself it's

360
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:40,450
haha your IQ is which in itself it's
 

361
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,030
haha your IQ is which in itself it's
just a number right

362
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:42,040
just a number right
 

363
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,180
just a number right
so you mentioned problem-solving

364
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:45,190
so you mentioned problem-solving
 

365
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:48,780
so you mentioned problem-solving
capacity yeah what what do you think of

366
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:48,790
capacity yeah what what do you think of
 

367
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:52,110
capacity yeah what what do you think of
as problem-solving about what can you

368
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:52,120
as problem-solving about what can you
 

369
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,910
as problem-solving about what can you
try to define intelligence like what

370
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:56,920
try to define intelligence like what
 

371
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,260
try to define intelligence like what
does it mean to be more or less

372
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:58,270
does it mean to be more or less
 

373
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,470
does it mean to be more or less
intelligent is it completely coupled to

374
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:01,480
intelligent is it completely coupled to
 

375
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,330
intelligent is it completely coupled to
a particular problem or is there

376
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:03,340
a particular problem or is there
 

377
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,950
a particular problem or is there
something a little bit more universal

378
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:04,960
something a little bit more universal
 

379
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,440
something a little bit more universal
yeah I do believe all intelligence is

380
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:07,450
yeah I do believe all intelligence is
 

381
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,600
yeah I do believe all intelligence is
specialized intelligence even human

382
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:09,610
specialized intelligence even human
 

383
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,640
specialized intelligence even human
intelligence has some degree of

384
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:11,650
intelligence has some degree of
 

385
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,500
intelligence has some degree of
generality well all intelligence systems

386
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:13,510
generality well all intelligence systems
 

387
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,540
generality well all intelligence systems
have some degree of generality they're

388
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:15,550
have some degree of generality they're
 

389
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,390
have some degree of generality they're
always specialized in in one category of

390
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:18,400
always specialized in in one category of
 

391
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,090
always specialized in in one category of
problems so the human intelligence is

392
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:21,100
problems so the human intelligence is
 

393
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,190
problems so the human intelligence is
specialized in the human experience and

394
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:23,200
specialized in the human experience and
 

395
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,090
specialized in the human experience and
that shows at various levels that shows

396
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:26,100
that shows at various levels that shows
 

397
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,880
that shows at various levels that shows
in some prior knowledge that's innate

398
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:29,890
in some prior knowledge that's innate
 

399
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,810
in some prior knowledge that's innate
that we have at birth knowledge about

400
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:32,820
that we have at birth knowledge about
 

401
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,469
that we have at birth knowledge about
things like agents goal-driven behavior

402
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479
things like agents goal-driven behavior
 

403
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,560
things like agents goal-driven behavior
visual priors about what makes an object

404
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:39,570
visual priors about what makes an object
 

405
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:43,860
visual priors about what makes an object
try us about time and so on that shows

406
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:43,870
try us about time and so on that shows
 

407
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,960
try us about time and so on that shows
also in the way we learn for instance is

408
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:45,970
also in the way we learn for instance is
 

409
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,710
also in the way we learn for instance is
very very fast to pick up language it's

410
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:49,720
very very fast to pick up language it's
 

411
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,510
very very fast to pick up language it's
very very easy for us to learn certain

412
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:51,520
very very easy for us to learn certain
 

413
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,740
very very easy for us to learn certain
things because we are basically

414
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:52,750
things because we are basically
 

415
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,440
things because we are basically
hard-coded to learn them and we are

416
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:55,450
hard-coded to learn them and we are
 

417
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,810
hard-coded to learn them and we are
specialized in solving certain kinds of

00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:57,820
specialized in solving certain kinds of
 

419
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,850
specialized in solving certain kinds of

to handle very long term problems we

426
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:08,920
to handle very long term problems we
 

427
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,040
to handle very long term problems we
have no capability of seeing that the

have no capability of seeing that the
 

429
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,990
have no capability of seeing that the
very long term we don't have them

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,540
how much working memory you know so how
do you think about long term using long

of years millennia what do you mean by

438
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:25,410
of years millennia what do you mean by
 

439
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,580
of years millennia what do you mean by
long term were not very good well human

00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,410
hierarchical view you have the brain at
the top of the pyramid then you have to

the top of the pyramid then you have to
 

579
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,020
the top of the pyramid then you have to
bother just plainly receiving orders and

580
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,030
bother just plainly receiving orders and

00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:40,190
work like this right there is no strong
 

593
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,950
work like this right there is no strong
delimitation between the brain and the

594
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:41,960
delimitation between the brain and the
 

595
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,230
delimitation between the brain and the
body stalin's you have to look not just

596
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:44,240
body stalin's you have to look not just
 

597
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,000
body stalin's you have to look not just
to the brain but at the nervous system

598
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,010
to the brain but at the nervous system
 

599
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,640
to the brain but at the nervous system
but then the nervous system and the body

600
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:48,650
but then the nervous system and the body
 

601
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,750
but then the nervous system and the body
are not free to step

602
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:49,760
are not free to step
 

603
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,910
are not free to step
and it is so you have to look at an

604
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:51,920
and it is so you have to look at an
 

605
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,400
and it is so you have to look at an
entire animal as one agent but then you

606
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:54,410
entire animal as one agent but then you
 

607
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,830
entire animal as one agent but then you
start realizing as you observe an animal

608
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:56,840
start realizing as you observe an animal
 

609
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:01,660
start realizing as you observe an animal
of any length of time that a lot of the

610
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:01,670
of any length of time that a lot of the
 

611
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,460
of any length of time that a lot of the
intelligence of an animal is actually

612
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:03,470
intelligence of an animal is actually
 

613
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,800
intelligence of an animal is actually
externalized that's especially true for

614
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:05,810
externalized that's especially true for
 

615
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,510
externalized that's especially true for
humans a lot of our intelligence is

616
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:07,520
humans a lot of our intelligence is
 

617
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,820
humans a lot of our intelligence is
externalized when you write down some

618
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:09,830
externalized when you write down some
 

619
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,830
externalized when you write down some
notes that is externalized intelligence

620
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:11,840
notes that is externalized intelligence
 

621
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,660
notes that is externalized intelligence
when you write the computer program you

622
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:13,670
when you write the computer program you
 

623
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,610
when you write the computer program you
are externalizing cognition

624
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:15,620
are externalizing cognition
 

625
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,440
are externalizing cognition
so it's externalizing books it's

626
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:17,450
so it's externalizing books it's
 

627
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,900
so it's externalizing books it's
generalized in in computers the internet

628

in other humans
 

631
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,600
in other humans
it's externalizing language and so on so

632
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:25,610
it's externalizing language and so on so
 

633
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:30,380
it's externalizing language and so on so
it's there is no like hardly limitation

634
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:30,390
it's there is no like hardly limitation
 

635
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,780
it's there is no like hardly limitation
of what makes an intelligent agent it's

do you think there is such a ability as

00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,040
do you think there is such a ability as
such a concept as a intelligence

646
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,050
such a concept as a intelligence
 

647
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:55,810
such a concept as a intelligence
explosion and a specific task and then

648
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:55,820
explosion and a specific task and then
 

649
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,550
explosion and a specific task and then
well yeah do you think it's possible to

650
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:58,560
well yeah do you think it's possible to
 

651
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,740
well yeah do you think it's possible to
have a category of tasks on which you do

652
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:00,750
have a category of tasks on which you do
 

653
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,810
have a category of tasks on which you do
have something like an exponential

654
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:02,820
have something like an exponential
 

655
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,510
have something like an exponential
growth of ability to solve that

656
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:05,520

particular problem
 

659
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,230

I think if you consider specificity corn

660
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:09,240
I think if you consider specificity corn
 

661
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,560
I think if you consider specificity corn
is probably possible to some extent I

662
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:14,570
is probably possible to some extent I
 

663
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,390
is probably possible to some extent I
also don't think we have to speculate

664
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:17,400
also don't think we have to speculate
 

665
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,840
also don't think we have to speculate
about it's because we have real-world

about it's because we have real-world

is the ad put is progress in terms of

is the ad put is progress in terms of

measure that like Michael Neilson for
 

807

00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:21,960
instance he had a very nice paper I
 

809
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,210
instance he had a very nice paper I
think that was last year about it so his

810
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:26,220
think that was last year about it so his
 

811
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,620
think that was last year about it so his
approach to measure a scientific

812
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:27,630
approach to measure a scientific
 

813
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,880
approach to measure a scientific
progress was to look at the time line of

814
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:31,890
progress was to look at the time line of
 

815
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,520
progress was to look at the time line of
scientific discoveries over the past you

816
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:34,530
scientific discoveries over the past you
 

817
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:39,380
scientific discoveries over the past you
know hundred 150 years and for each

818
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:39,390
know hundred 150 years and for each
 

819
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:42,770
know hundred 150 years and for each
measure discovery ask a panel of experts

820
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:42,780
measure discovery ask a panel of experts
 

821
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,680
measure discovery ask a panel of experts
to rate the significance of the

822
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:45,690
to rate the significance of the
 

823
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,770
to rate the significance of the
discovery and if the output of Sciences

824
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:48,780
discovery and if the output of Sciences
 

825
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,720
discovery and if the output of Sciences
institution were exponential you will

826
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:50,730
institution were exponential you will
 

827
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:55,280
institution were exponential you will
expect the example density of

828
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:55,290
expect the example density of
 

829
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,830
expect the example density of
significance to go up exponentially

830
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:57,840
significance to go up exponentially
 

831
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,200
significance to go up exponentially
maybe because there's a faster rate of

832
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,210
maybe because there's a faster rate of
 

833
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,580
maybe because there's a faster rate of
discoveries maybe because the

834
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:01,590
discoveries maybe because the
 

835
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,470
discoveries maybe because the
discoveries are you know increasingly

836
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:03,480
discoveries are you know increasingly
 

837
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,530
discoveries are you know increasingly
more important and what actually happens

838
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:06,540
more important and what actually happens
 

839
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,080
more important and what actually happens
if you if you plot this temporal density

840
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,090
if you if you plot this temporal density
 

841
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,360
if you if you plot this temporal density
of significance measured in this way is

842
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:11,370
of significance measured in this way is
 

843
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:14,600
of significance measured in this way is
that you see very much a flat graph you

844
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:14,610
that you see very much a flat graph you
 

845
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,220
that you see very much a flat graph you
see a flat graph across all disciplines

846
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:16,230
see a flat graph across all disciplines
 

847
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,950
see a flat graph across all disciplines
across physics biology medicine and so

848
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:18,960
across physics biology medicine and so
 

849
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,370
across physics biology medicine and so
on and it actually makes a lot of sense

850
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:22,380
on and it actually makes a lot of sense
 

851
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,750

about the progress of physics a hundred
 

855
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,610
about the progress of physics a hundred
and ten years ago right it was a time of

00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:28,620
and ten years ago right it was a time of
 

857
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,950
and ten years ago right it was a time of
crazy change think about the progress of

00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:30,960
crazy change think about the progress of
 

859
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,700
crazy change think about the progress of
technology

scars
 

867
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,170

when we saw that in electricity and so

868
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:39,180
when we saw that in electricity and so
 

869
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,150
when we saw that in electricity and so
on it was a time of incredible change

00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:41,160
on it was a time of incredible change
 

871
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,550
on it was a time of incredible change
and today is also a time a very fast

and today is also a time a very fast
 

873
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,640

you have significance idea of seeing a
 

889
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,419
you have significance idea of seeing a
family sorry you do see very flat curves

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:14,650
the paper that Michael Nielson had about
 

895
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:19,680
the paper that Michael Nielson had about
this idea and so the way interpret is as

896
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:19,690
this idea and so the way interpret is as
 

897
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:23,520
this idea and so the way interpret is as
you make progress in an in a given field

898
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:23,530
you make progress in an in a given field
 

899
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,720
you make progress in an in a given field
on any given subtitles it becomes

900
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:26,730
on any given subtitles it becomes
 

901
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:29,010
on any given subtitles it becomes
exponentially more difficult to make

902
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:29,020
exponentially more difficult to make
 

903
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,760
exponentially more difficult to make
further progress like the very first

904
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:31,770
further progress like the very first
 

905
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,010
further progress like the very first
person to work on information theory if

906
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:35,020
person to work on information theory if
 

907
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,110
person to work on information theory if
you enter a new field and still the very

908
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,120
you enter a new field and still the very
 

909
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,870
you enter a new field and still the very
early years there's a lot of low-hanging

910
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:39,880
early years there's a lot of low-hanging
 

911
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,730
early years there's a lot of low-hanging
fruits you can take that's right yeah

912
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:41,740
fruits you can take that's right yeah
 

913
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,770
fruits you can take that's right yeah
but the next generation of researchers

914
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:43,780
but the next generation of researchers
 

915
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,530
but the next generation of researchers
is gonna have to dig much harder

916
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:46,540
is gonna have to dig much harder
 

917
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,940
is gonna have to dig much harder
actually to make smaller discoveries a

918
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:49,950
actually to make smaller discoveries a
 

919
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,780
actually to make smaller discoveries a
probably larger number of small

920
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:51,790
probably larger number of small
 

921
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,580
probably larger number of small
discoveries and to achieve the same

922
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:53,590
discoveries and to achieve the same
 

923
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,470
discoveries and to achieve the same
amount of impact you're gonna need a

924
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:55,480
amount of impact you're gonna need a
 

925
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,000
amount of impact you're gonna need a
much greater headcount

926
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,010
much greater headcount
 

927
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,860
much greater headcount
and that's exactly the picture you're

928
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:58,870
and that's exactly the picture you're
 

929
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,549
and that's exactly the picture you're
seeing with science that the number of

930
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:01,559
seeing with science that the number of
 

931
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:04,409
seeing with science that the number of
scientists and engineers is in fact

932
00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:04,419
scientists and engineers is in fact
 

933
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:07,049
scientists and engineers is in fact
increasing exponentially the amount of

934
00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:07,059
increasing exponentially the amount of
 

935
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:08,640
increasing exponentially the amount of
computational resources that are

936
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:08,650
computational resources that are
 

937
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:11,010
computational resources that are
available to science is increasing

938
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:11,020
available to science is increasing
 

939
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,570
available to science is increasing
exponentially and so on so the resource

940
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:12,580
exponentially and so on so the resource
 

941
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,030
exponentially and so on so the resource
consumption of science is exponential

942
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:15,040
consumption of science is exponential
 

943
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,270
consumption of science is exponential
but the output in terms of progress in

944
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:18,280
but the output in terms of progress in
 

945
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,240
but the output in terms of progress in
terms of significance is linear and the

946
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,250
terms of significance is linear and the
 

947
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,820
terms of significance is linear and the
reason why is because and even though

948
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:23,830
reason why is because and even though
 

949
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,860
reason why is because and even though
science is recursively self-improving

950
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:25,870
science is recursively self-improving
 

951
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,049
science is recursively self-improving
meaning that scientific progress mm-hmm

952
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:28,059
meaning that scientific progress mm-hmm
 

953
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:30,330
meaning that scientific progress mm-hmm
turns into technological progress which

954
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:30,340
turns into technological progress which
 

955
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,510
turns into technological progress which
in turn helps science if you look at

956
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:33,520
in turn helps science if you look at
 

957
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,210
in turn helps science if you look at
computers for instance our products of

958
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:36,220
computers for instance our products of
 

959
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,210
computers for instance our products of
science and computers are tremendously

960
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:39,220
science and computers are tremendously
 

961
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,640
science and computers are tremendously
useful in spinning up science the

962
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:41,650
useful in spinning up science the
 

963
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,140
useful in spinning up science the
internet same thing the engine is a

964
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:43,150
internet same thing the engine is a
 

965
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,870
internet same thing the engine is a
technology that's made possible by

966
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:44,880
technology that's made possible by
 

967
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,039
technology that's made possible by
various incentive advances and itself

968
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:49,049
various incentive advances and itself
 

969
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:51,180
various incentive advances and itself

communication across researchers if you
 

1135
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,350
communication across researchers if you
look at you were mentioned in quantum

1136
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:21,360
look at you were mentioned in quantum
 

1137
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,320
look at you were mentioned in quantum
mechanics right well if you wants to

1139
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,720

knowledge you have to ingest which is
 

1147
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:35,869
knowledge you have to ingest which is
huge so there is a very large overhead

00:24:35,869 --> 00:24:35,879
huge so there is a very large overhead
 

1149
00:24:35,879 --> 00:24:39,470
huge so there is a very large overhead
to even start to contribute there is a

go against this narrative because
 

1215
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:07,279
go against this narrative because
because it is not really a scientific

in computer science and most people who
 

1243
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,690

00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,050
more so the pushback you're getting it's
 

1253
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:47,890
more so the pushback you're getting it's
from people who get attached to the

the ways that all of human civilization
 

1277
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,400
the ways that all of human civilization
will be destroyed I think it's a good

1285
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,920
stories right reiji's mythology if you
look at the mythology of most

1286
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:32,930
look at the mythology of most
 

1287
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:36,250
look at the mythology of most
civilizations it's about the world being

1288
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:36,260
civilizations it's about the world being
 

1289
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,560
civilizations it's about the world being
headed towards some final event in which

1290
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:38,570
headed towards some final event in which
 

1291
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:41,050
headed towards some final event in which
the world will be destroyed and some new

1292
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:41,060
the world will be destroyed and some new
 

1293
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,300
the world will be destroyed and some new
world order will arise that will be

1294
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:43,310
world order will arise that will be
 

1295
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,460
world order will arise that will be
mostly spiritual like the apocalypse

1296
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:45,470
mostly spiritual like the apocalypse
 

1297
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:49,600
mostly spiritual like the apocalypse
followed by products probably yeah it's

1298
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:49,610
followed by products probably yeah it's
 

1299
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,790
followed by products probably yeah it's
a very appealing story on a fundamental

1300
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:51,800
a very appealing story on a fundamental
 

1301
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,880
a very appealing story on a fundamental
level and we all need stories we own

1302
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:54,890
level and we all need stories we own
 

1303
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:57,100
level and we all need stories we own
stories to structure in the way we see

1304
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,110
stories to structure in the way we see
 

1305
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:00,070
stories to structure in the way we see
the world especially at time scales that

1306
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,080
the world especially at time scales that
 

1307
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,590
the world especially at time scales that
are beyond our ability to make

1308
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:02,600
are beyond our ability to make
 

1309
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,670
are beyond our ability to make
predictions right so on a more serious

1310
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:06,680
predictions right so on a more serious
 

1311
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,810
predictions right so on a more serious
non exponential explosion

1312
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:09,820
non exponential explosion
 

1313
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,720
non exponential explosion
question do you think there will be a

1314
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:12,730
question do you think there will be a
 

1315
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:18,370
question do you think there will be a
time when we'll create something like

1316
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:18,380
time when we'll create something like
 

1317
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,370
time when we'll create something like
human level intelligence or intelligence

1318
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:21,380
human level intelligence or intelligence
 

1319
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,500
human level intelligence or intelligence
systems that will make you sit back and

1320
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:23,510
systems that will make you sit back and
 

1321
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:27,010
systems that will make you sit back and
be just surprised at damn how smart this

1322
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:27,020
be just surprised at damn how smart this
 

1323
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,169
be just surprised at damn how smart this
thing is that doesn't require

1324
00:28:29,169 --> 00:28:29,179
thing is that doesn't require
 

1325
00:28:29,179 --> 00:28:30,820
thing is that doesn't require
exponential growth and an exponential

1326
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:30,830
exponential growth and an exponential
 

1327
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:33,970
exponential growth and an exponential
improvement but what what's your sense

1328
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:33,980
improvement but what what's your sense
 

1329
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,539
improvement but what what's your sense
than a time line and so on that where

1330
00:28:37,539 --> 00:28:37,549
than a time line and so on that where
 

1331
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,269
than a time line and so on that where
you'll be really surprised at certain

1332
00:28:40,269 --> 00:28:40,279
you'll be really surprised at certain
 

1333
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:41,500
you'll be really surprised at certain
capabilities and we'll talk about

1334
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:41,510
capabilities and we'll talk about
 

1335
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,299
capabilities and we'll talk about
limitations and deep learners so when do

1336
00:28:43,299 --> 00:28:43,309
limitations and deep learners so when do
 

1337
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:44,680
limitations and deep learners so when do
you think in your lifetime you'll be

1338
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:44,690
you think in your lifetime you'll be
 

1339
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:48,610
you think in your lifetime you'll be
really damn surprised around 2013-2014 I

1340
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:48,620
really damn surprised around 2013-2014 I
 

1341
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,549
really damn surprised around 2013-2014 I
was many times surprised by the

1342
00:28:51,549 --> 00:28:51,559
was many times surprised by the
 

1343
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:53,470
was many times surprised by the
capabilities of deep learning actually

1344
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:53,480
capabilities of deep learning actually
 

1345
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,840
capabilities of deep learning actually
that was before we had assess exactly

1346
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:55,850
that was before we had assess exactly
 

1347
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,730
that was before we had assess exactly
well deepening could do and could not do

1348
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:57,740
well deepening could do and could not do
 

1349
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,560
well deepening could do and could not do
and it felt like a time of immense

1350
00:28:59,560 --> 00:28:59,570
and it felt like a time of immense
 

1351
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,570
and it felt like a time of immense
potential and then we started you know

1352
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:01,580
potential and then we started you know
 

1353
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,519
potential and then we started you know
narrowing it down but I was very

1354
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:03,529
narrowing it down but I was very
 

1355
00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:05,710
narrowing it down but I was very
surprised so it's a it's it's it's it

1356
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:05,720
surprised so it's a it's it's it's it
 

1357
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,750
surprised so it's a it's it's it's it
has already happened was there a moment

1358
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:07,760
has already happened was there a moment
 

1359
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,990
has already happened was there a moment
there must have been a day in there

1360
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,000
there must have been a day in there
 

1361
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,139
there must have been a day in there
where your surprise was almost bordering

1362
00:29:14,139 --> 00:29:14,149
where your surprise was almost bordering
 

1363
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:17,590
where your surprise was almost bordering
on the belief of the narrative that we

1364
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:17,600
on the belief of the narrative that we
 

1365
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,870
on the belief of the narrative that we
just discussed what it was there a

1366
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:19,880
just discussed what it was there a
 

1367
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,909
just discussed what it was there a
moment because you've written quite

1368
00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:21,919
moment because you've written quite
 

1369
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,260
moment because you've written quite
eloquently about the limits of deep

1370
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:23,270
eloquently about the limits of deep
 

1371
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,240
eloquently about the limits of deep
learning was there a moment that you

1372
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:25,250
learning was there a moment that you
 

1373
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,950
learning was there a moment that you
thought that maybe deep learning is

1374
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:26,960
thought that maybe deep learning is
 

1375
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,240
thought that maybe deep learning is
limitless no I don't think I've ever

1376
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:31,250
limitless no I don't think I've ever
 

1377
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,610
limitless no I don't think I've ever
believed this what was restocking is

1378
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:33,620
believed this what was restocking is
 

1379
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,799
believed this what was restocking is
that it it worked all right they worked

1380
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:35,809
that it it worked all right they worked
 

1381
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:38,860
that it it worked all right they worked
at all yes yeah but there's a there's a

1382
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:38,870
at all yes yeah but there's a there's a
 

1383
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:41,740
at all yes yeah but there's a there's a
big jump between being able to do really

1384
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:41,750
big jump between being able to do really
 

1385
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,200
big jump between being able to do really
good computer vision and human level

1386
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:44,210
good computer vision and human level
 

1387
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:46,840
good computer vision and human level
intelligence so I I don't think at any

1388
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:46,850
intelligence so I I don't think at any
 

1389
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:49,750
intelligence so I I don't think at any
points I wasn't an impression that the

1390
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:49,760
points I wasn't an impression that the
 

1391
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,460
points I wasn't an impression that the
results we got in computer vision meant

1392
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:51,470
results we got in computer vision meant
 

1393
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:53,230
results we got in computer vision meant
that we were very close to him and even

1394
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:53,240
that we were very close to him and even
 

1395
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,639
that we were very close to him and even
intelligence I don't think we're very

1396
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:54,649
intelligence I don't think we're very
 

1397
00:29:54,649 --> 00:29:56,169
intelligence I don't think we're very
close to human ever intelligence I do

1398
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:56,179
close to human ever intelligence I do
 

1399
00:29:56,179 --> 00:29:58,990
close to human ever intelligence I do
believe that there's no reason why we

1400
00:29:58,990 --> 00:29:59,000
believe that there's no reason why we
 

1401
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,049
believe that there's no reason why we
want achieve it at some point I also

1402
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:02,059
want achieve it at some point I also
 

1403
00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:06,010
want achieve it at some point I also
believe that you know it's the problem

1404
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:06,020
believe that you know it's the problem
 

1405
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,840
believe that you know it's the problem
is with talking about human level

1406
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:07,850
is with talking about human level
 

1407
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:10,600
is with talking about human level
intelligence that implicitly you are

1408
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:10,610
intelligence that implicitly you are
 

1409
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,820
intelligence that implicitly you are
considering like an axis of intelligence

1410
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:12,830
considering like an axis of intelligence
 

1411
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,769
considering like an axis of intelligence
with different levels but that's not

1412
00:30:14,769 --> 00:30:14,779
with different levels but that's not
 

1413
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:16,230
with different levels but that's not
really how intelligence works

1414
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:16,240
really how intelligence works
 

1415
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,220
really how intelligence works
intelligence is very multi-dimensional

1416
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:18,230
intelligence is very multi-dimensional
 

1417
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,299
intelligence is very multi-dimensional
and so there's the question of

1418
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:21,309
and so there's the question of
 

1419
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:23,090
and so there's the question of
capabilities but there's

1420
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:23,100
capabilities but there's
 

1421
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,649
capabilities but there's
also the question is being human-like

1422
00:30:24,649 --> 00:30:24,659
also the question is being human-like
 

1423
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:27,289
also the question is being human-like
and two very different things like you

1424
00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:27,299
and two very different things like you
 

1425
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:29,629
and two very different things like you
can be potentially very advanced

1426
00:30:29,629 --> 00:30:29,639
can be potentially very advanced
 

1427
00:30:29,639 --> 00:30:31,460
can be potentially very advanced
intelligent agents that are not human

1428
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:31,470
intelligent agents that are not human
 

1429
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,950
intelligent agents that are not human
like at all and you can also build very

1430
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:33,960
like at all and you can also build very
 

1431
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,169
like at all and you can also build very
human-like agents and this out okay

1432
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:36,179
human-like agents and this out okay
 

1433
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:37,999
human-like agents and this out okay
two very different things right right

1434
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:38,009
two very different things right right
 

1435
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:41,090
two very different things right right
let's go from the philosophical to the

1436
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:41,100
let's go from the philosophical to the
 

1437
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,249
let's go from the philosophical to the
practical I can give me a history of

1438
00:30:43,249 --> 00:30:43,259
practical I can give me a history of
 

1439
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:45,649
practical I can give me a history of
Karis and all the major deep learning

1440
00:30:45,649 --> 00:30:45,659

discussions yeah that's a broad topic so

1452
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:00,990
discussions yeah that's a broad topic so
 

1453
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:05,299
discussions yeah that's a broad topic so
I started working on chaos to the name

1454
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:05,309
I started working on chaos to the name
 

1455
00:31:05,309 --> 00:31:06,889
I started working on chaos to the name
chaos at the time I actually pick the

1456
00:31:06,889 --> 00:31:06,899
chaos at the time I actually pick the
 

1457
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:09,680
chaos at the time I actually pick the
name like just today I was gonna release

1458
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:09,690
name like just today I was gonna release
 

1459
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,629
name like just today I was gonna release
it so I started working on it in

1460
00:31:11,629 --> 00:31:11,639
it so I started working on it in
 

1461
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:16,399
it so I started working on it in
February 2015 and so at the time there

1462
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:16,409
February 2015 and so at the time there
 

1463
00:31:16,409 --> 00:31:17,690
February 2015 and so at the time there
weren't too many people working on deep

1464
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:17,700
weren't too many people working on deep
 

1465
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,700
weren't too many people working on deep
learning maybe like fewer than 10,000

1466
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:19,710

the software tuning was not really

1468
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:22,169
the software tuning was not really
 

1469
00:31:22,169 --> 00:31:24,529
the software tuning was not really
developed

1470
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:24,539

 

1471
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:26,220

so the

1472
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:26,230
so the
 

1473
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:29,160
so the
deepening library was cafe which was

1474
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,170
deepening library was cafe which was
 

1475
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:32,160
deepening library was cafe which was
mostly C++ why do I say cafe was the

1476
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,170
mostly C++ why do I say cafe was the
 

1477
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:34,890
mostly C++ why do I say cafe was the
main one cafe was vastly more popular

1478
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:34,900
main one cafe was vastly more popular
 

1479
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,490
main one cafe was vastly more popular
than ya know in in late 2014 early 2015

1480
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:38,500
than ya know in in late 2014 early 2015
 

1481
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,760
than ya know in in late 2014 early 2015
cafe was the one library that everyone

1482
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:41,770
cafe was the one library that everyone
 

1483
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,470
cafe was the one library that everyone
was using for computer vision and

1484
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:43,480
was using for computer vision and
 

1485
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,270
was using for computer vision and
computer vision was the most popular

1486
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:45,280
computer vision was the most popular
 

1487
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,880
computer vision was the most popular

covenants was like the subfield of

1490
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:49,960
covenants was like the subfield of
 

1491
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,310
covenants was like the subfield of
deplaning it everyone was working on so

1492
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:53,320
deplaning it everyone was working on so
 

1493
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,930

1516
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:31,380
in lsdm for instance so I decided to
 

1517
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,410
in lsdm for instance so I decided to
build my own and that first the pitch

1518
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:34,420
build my own and that first the pitch
 

1519
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,900
build my own and that first the pitch
for that was it was going to be mostly

1520
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:36,910
for that was it was going to be mostly
 

1521
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:40,500
for that was it was going to be mostly
around lsdm Iconia networks it was going

1522
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:40,510
around lsdm Iconia networks it was going
 

1523
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:44,040
around lsdm Iconia networks it was going

00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:45,670
the time that was Canon are obvious is
 

1527
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:49,230
the time that was Canon are obvious is
that the models would be defined yeah a

1528
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:49,240
that the models would be defined yeah a
 

1529
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,640
that the models would be defined yeah a
Python code which was kind of like going

1530
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:52,650
Python code which was kind of like going
 

1531
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,930
Python code which was kind of like going
against the mainstream at the time

1532
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:54,940
against the mainstream at the time

all the big libraries were actually

1536
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:00,160
all the big libraries were actually
 

1537
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,580
all the big libraries were actually
going with you approach sharing static

00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:04,870
configuration files in Yemen to define
 

1541
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:08,190
configuration files in Yemen to define
models so some libraries were using code

1542
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:08,200
models so some libraries were using code
 

1543
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
models so some libraries were using code
to define models like torch 7 obviously

1544
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:10,210
to define models like torch 7 obviously
 

1545
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:13,770
to define models like torch 7 obviously
that was not Python Lezyne was like a

1546
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:13,780
that was not Python Lezyne was like a
 

1547
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:17,160
that was not Python Lezyne was like a
piano based very early library that was

1548
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,170
piano based very early library that was
 

1549
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:18,210
piano based very early library that was
I think developed I don't remember

1550
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:18,220
I think developed I don't remember
 

1551
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,520
I think developed I don't remember
exactly probably late 2014

1552
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:20,530
exactly probably late 2014
 

1553
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,230

Python as well it's Python as well it

1554
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:22,240
Python as well it's Python as well it
 

1555
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,310
Python as well it's Python as well it
was it was like on top of Tiano and so I

1556
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:26,320
was it was like on top of Tiano and so I
 

1557
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,460
was it was like on top of Tiano and so I
started working on something

1558
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:29,470
started working on something
 

1559
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,590
started working on something
and in the value proposition at the time

1560
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:31,600
and in the value proposition at the time
 

1561
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,560
and in the value proposition at the time
was that not only that the what I think

1562
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:34,570
was that not only that the what I think
 

1563
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:37,350
was that not only that the what I think
was the first reducible open-source

1564
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:37,360
was the first reducible open-source
 

1565
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,020
was the first reducible open-source
implementation FRS diem

you could combine Islands and covenants

1568
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:43,560
you could combine Islands and covenants
 

1569
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,840
you could combine Islands and covenants
with the same library which is not

1570
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:45,850
with the same library which is not
 

1571
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,880
with the same library which is not
really possible before like a he was on

1572
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:47,890
really possible before like a he was on
 

1573
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:51,750
really possible before like a he was on
into incontinence and it was kind of

1574
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:51,760
into incontinence and it was kind of
 

1575
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,880
into incontinence and it was kind of
easy to use because so before I was

1576
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:53,890
easy to use because so before I was
 

1577
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:54,930
easy to use because so before I was
using ten I was actually using

1578
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:54,940
using ten I was actually using
 

1579
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,580
using ten I was actually using
psychically on and I loved psychically

1580
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:56,590
psychically on and I loved psychically
 

1581
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:59,730
psychically on and I loved psychically
for its usability so I drew a lot of

1582
00:33:59,730 --> 00:33:59,740
for its usability so I drew a lot of
 

1583
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,710
for its usability so I drew a lot of
inspiration from psychic then when I

1584
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:01,720
inspiration from psychic then when I
 

1585
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,020
inspiration from psychic then when I
went Cara's it's almost like cycling for

1586
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:04,030
went Cara's it's almost like cycling for
 

1587
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,340
went Cara's it's almost like cycling for
neural networks yeah

1588
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:05,350
neural networks yeah
 

1589
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,410

right and of course you know some people

1596
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:13,930
right and of course you know some people
 

1597
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:16,260
right and of course you know some people
will say this is hiding a lot of details

1598
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:16,270
will say this is hiding a lot of details
 

1599
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,120
will say this is hiding a lot of details
but that's exactly the point

1600
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:18,130
but that's exactly the point
 

1601
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,070
but that's exactly the point
all right the magic is the point all

1602
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:20,080
all right the magic is the point all
 

1603
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,440
all right the magic is the point all
right so it's magical but in a good way

1604
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:22,450
right so it's magical but in a good way
 

1605
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:24,090
right so it's magical but in a good way
it's magical in the sense that it's

1606
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:24,100
it's magical in the sense that it's
 

1607
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,550
it's magical in the sense that it's
delightful yeah right yeah I'm actually

1608
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:26,560
delightful yeah right yeah I'm actually
 

1609
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,290
delightful yeah right yeah I'm actually
quite surprised I didn't know that it

1610
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:28,300
quite surprised I didn't know that it
 

1611
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,020
quite surprised I didn't know that it
was born out of desire to implement our

1612
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:31,030
was born out of desire to implement our
 

1613
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:33,690
was born out of desire to implement our
hands in lc/ms it was that's fascinating

1614
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:33,700
hands in lc/ms it was that's fascinating
 

1615
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,640
hands in lc/ms it was that's fascinating
so you were actually one of the first

1616
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:35,650
so you were actually one of the first
 

1617
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:38,670
so you were actually one of the first
people to really try to attempt to get

1618
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:38,680
people to really try to attempt to get
 

1619
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,760
people to really try to attempt to get
the major architectures together and

1620
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:40,770
the major architectures together and
 

1621
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:43,020
the major architectures together and
it's also interesting you made me

1622
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:43,030
it's also interesting you made me
 

1623
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,610
it's also interesting you made me
realize that that was a design decision

1624
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:44,620
realize that that was a design decision
 

1625
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,560
realize that that was a design decision
at all is defining the model in code

1626
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:46,570
at all is defining the model in code
 

1627
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:49,040
at all is defining the model in code
just I'm putting myself in your shoes

1628
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,050
just I'm putting myself in your shoes
 

1629
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:51,960
just I'm putting myself in your shoes
whether the yamo especially if cafe was

1630
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:51,970
whether the yamo especially if cafe was
 

1631
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:54,030
whether the yamo especially if cafe was
the most popular it was the most but I

1632
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:54,040
the most popular it was the most but I
 

1633
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,120
the most popular it was the most but I
might fall if I was I'm if I were yeah I

1634
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:57,130
might fall if I was I'm if I were yeah I
 

1635
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,490
might fall if I was I'm if I were yeah I
don't it I didn't like the yellow thing

1636
00:34:59,490 --> 00:34:59,500
don't it I didn't like the yellow thing
 

1637
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,520
don't it I didn't like the yellow thing
but it makes more sense that you will

1638
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:02,530
but it makes more sense that you will
 

1639
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,050
but it makes more sense that you will
put in a configuration file the

1640
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:04,060
put in a configuration file the
 

1641
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,940
put in a configuration file the
definition of a model that's an

1642
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:05,950
definition of a model that's an
 

1643
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,920
definition of a model that's an
interesting gutsy move just stick with

1644
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:07,930
interesting gutsy move just stick with
 

1645
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:10,860
interesting gutsy move just stick with
defining it in code just if you look

1646
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:10,870
defining it in code just if you look
 

1647
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:13,170
defining it in code just if you look
back other libraries we're doing it as

1648
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:13,180
back other libraries we're doing it as
 

1649
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,180
back other libraries we're doing it as
well but it was definitely the more

1650
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:15,190
well but it was definitely the more
 

1651
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:18,210
well but it was definitely the more
niche option yeah okay Cara's and then

1652
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:18,220
niche option yeah okay Cara's and then
 

1653
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,490
niche option yeah okay Cara's and then
girls so I really scare us in March 2015

1654
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:20,500
girls so I really scare us in March 2015
 

1655
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,160
girls so I really scare us in March 2015
and it got she's just pretty much from

1656
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:23,170
and it got she's just pretty much from
 

1657
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:25,050
and it got she's just pretty much from
the start so the deep learning community

1658
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:25,060
the start so the deep learning community
 

1659
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,880
the start so the deep learning community
was very small at the time

1660
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:26,890
was very small at the time
 

1661
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:29,010
was very small at the time
lots of people were starting to be

1662
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:29,020
lots of people were starting to be
 

1663
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,930
lots of people were starting to be
interested in the rest um so it was

1664
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:30,940
interested in the rest um so it was
 

1665
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,250
interested in the rest um so it was
gonna release it at the right time

1666
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:32,260
gonna release it at the right time
 

1667
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,750
gonna release it at the right time
because it was offering an easy to use

1668
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:33,760
because it was offering an easy to use
 

1669
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,210
because it was offering an easy to use
it as team implementation exactly at the

1670
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:36,220
it as team implementation exactly at the
 

1671
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,920
it as team implementation exactly at the
time where lots of yours started to be

1672
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:37,930
time where lots of yours started to be
 

1673
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:41,460
time where lots of yours started to be
intrigued by the capabilities of onin on

1674
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:41,470
intrigued by the capabilities of onin on
 

1675
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:46,100
intrigued by the capabilities of onin on
ins one LP so it it grew from there

1676
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:46,110

 

1677
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:50,020

then I joined Google

1678
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:50,030
then I joined Google
 

1679
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:52,360
then I joined Google
about six months later and that was

1680
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:52,370
about six months later and that was
 

1681
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:54,550
about six months later and that was
actually completely unrelated to took

1682
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:54,560
actually completely unrelated to took
 

1683
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,530
actually completely unrelated to took
care us actually joined a research team

1684
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:56,540
care us actually joined a research team
 

1685
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:59,830
care us actually joined a research team
working on image classification mostly

1686
00:35:59,830 --> 00:35:59,840
working on image classification mostly
 

1687
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,150
working on image classification mostly
like computer vision so I was doing

1688
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:01,160
like computer vision so I was doing
 

1689
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,530
like computer vision so I was doing
computer vision research at Google

1690
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:02,540
computer vision research at Google
 

1691
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:05,050
computer vision research at Google
initially and immediately when I joined

1692
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:05,060
initially and immediately when I joined
 

1693
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:08,410
initially and immediately when I joined
Google I was exposed to the early

1694
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:08,420
Google I was exposed to the early
 

1695
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,360
Google I was exposed to the early
internal version of tensorflow

1696
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:10,370
internal version of tensorflow
 

1697
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:13,540
internal version of tensorflow
and the way to appeal to me at the time

1698
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:13,550
and the way to appeal to me at the time
 

1699
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,220
and the way to appeal to me at the time
and that was definitely the way it was

1700
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:15,230
and that was definitely the way it was
 

1701
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:18,940
and that was definitely the way it was
at the time is that this was an improved

1702
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:18,950
at the time is that this was an improved
 

1703
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,110
at the time is that this was an improved
version of Tiano

1704
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:20,120
version of Tiano
 

1705
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:24,100
version of Tiano
so I immediately knew I had to port cars

1706
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:24,110
so I immediately knew I had to port cars
 

1707
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:27,430
so I immediately knew I had to port cars
to this new tensorflow thing and I was

1708
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:27,440
to this new tensorflow thing and I was
 

1709
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,860
to this new tensorflow thing and I was
actually very busy as as as a noogler as

1710
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:29,870
actually very busy as as as a noogler as
 

1711
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:33,460
actually very busy as as as a noogler as
a new Googler so I had not time to work

1712
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:33,470
a new Googler so I had not time to work
 

1713
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,830
a new Googler so I had not time to work
on that but then in November I think

1714
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:35,840
on that but then in November I think
 

1715
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,380
on that but then in November I think
twist November 2015

1716
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:38,390
twist November 2015
 

1717
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:41,920
twist November 2015
tensorflow got released and it was kind

1718
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:41,930
tensorflow got released and it was kind
 

1719
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:45,310
tensorflow got released and it was kind
of like my my wake-up call at hey to

1720
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:45,320
of like my my wake-up call at hey to
 

1721
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,870
of like my my wake-up call at hey to
actually you know go and make it happen

1722
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:46,880
actually you know go and make it happen
 

1723
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,430
actually you know go and make it happen
so in December I I putted cars to run on

1724
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:51,440
so in December I I putted cars to run on
 

1725
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,870
so in December I I putted cars to run on
two of tensorflow but it was not exactly

1726
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:52,880
two of tensorflow but it was not exactly
 

1727
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,480
two of tensorflow but it was not exactly
port it was more like a refactoring

1728
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:54,490
port it was more like a refactoring
 

1729
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:58,210
port it was more like a refactoring
where I was abstracting away all the

1730
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:58,220
where I was abstracting away all the
 

1731
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,070
where I was abstracting away all the
backend functionality into one module

1732
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:00,080
backend functionality into one module
 

1733
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,950
backend functionality into one module
then the same codebase could run on top

1734
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:02,960
then the same codebase could run on top
 

1735
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,220
then the same codebase could run on top
of multiple backends right so on top of

1736
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:06,230
of multiple backends right so on top of
 

1737
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:09,070
of multiple backends right so on top of
things fluor Theano and for the next

1738
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:09,080
things fluor Theano and for the next
 

1739
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:13,510
things fluor Theano and for the next
year yeah no you know stayed as the

1740
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:13,520
year yeah no you know stayed as the
 

1741
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,930
year yeah no you know stayed as the
default option it was you know it was

1742
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:16,940
default option it was you know it was
 

1743
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:20,830
default option it was you know it was
easier to use somewhat let's begin it

1744
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:20,840
easier to use somewhat let's begin it
 

1745
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,390
easier to use somewhat let's begin it
was much faster especially when he came

1746
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:22,400
was much faster especially when he came
 

1747
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,460
was much faster especially when he came
to Orleans but eventually you know a

1748
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:24,470
to Orleans but eventually you know a
 

1749
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,210
to Orleans but eventually you know a
tensorflow

architectural decisions there's the
 

1757
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,780
architectural decisions there's the
arrow yeah so what is there was a

1758
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:34,790
arrow yeah so what is there was a
 

1759
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:37,570
arrow yeah so what is there was a
natural as a natural transition yeah

1760
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:37,580
natural as a natural transition yeah
 

1761
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,050

so what I mean that still carries is the
 

1765
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,880
so what I mean that still carries is the
side almost fun project right yeah so it

1766
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:45,890
side almost fun project right yeah so it
 

1767
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:49,570
side almost fun project right yeah so it
it was not my job assignment it's not I

you're excited about what are you
 

1861
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:05,080
you're excited about what are you
excited about in 2.0 I mean eager

execution there's so many things that

1864
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:06,590
execution there's so many things that
 

1865
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,990
execution there's so many things that
just make it a lot easier

1866

what's also really hard what are the
 

1871
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,420
what's also really hard what are the
problems you have to kind of saw

1872
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:15,430
problems you have to kind of saw
 

1873
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,550
problems you have to kind of saw
so I've spent the past year and a half

1874

so I've spent the past year and a half
 

1875
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,420
so I've spent the past year and a half
working on 1002 and it's been a long

carrot side what I'm really excited
 

1887
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:38,270
carrot side what I'm really excited
about is that so

1888

you know previously Kara's has been this

1890
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:40,840
you know previously Kara's has been this
 

1891
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,250
you know previously Kara's has been this
very easy-to-use high level interface to

1892
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:44,260
very easy-to-use high level interface to
 

1893
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:49,000
very easy-to-use high level interface to
do deep learning but if you wanted to

1894
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,010
do deep learning but if you wanted to
 

1895
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,490
do deep learning but if you wanted to
you know if you wanted a lot of

1896
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:51,500
you know if you wanted a lot of
 

1897
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,810
you know if you wanted a lot of
flexibility the chaos framework you know

1898
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:54,820
flexibility the chaos framework you know
 

1899
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,089
flexibility the chaos framework you know
was probably not the optimal way to do

1900
00:40:58,089 --> 00:40:58,099
was probably not the optimal way to do
 

1901
00:40:58,099 --> 00:40:59,620
was probably not the optimal way to do
things compared to just writing

1902
00:40:59,620 --> 00:40:59,630
things compared to just writing
 

1903
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:02,770
things compared to just writing
everything from scratch so in some way

1904
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:02,780
everything from scratch so in some way
 

1905
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,630
everything from scratch so in some way
the framework was getting in the way and

1906
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:04,640
the framework was getting in the way and
 

1907
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,790
the framework was getting in the way and
in terms of you to you don't have this

1908
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:06,800
in terms of you to you don't have this
 

1909
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,460
in terms of you to you don't have this
at all actually you have the usability

1910
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:09,470
at all actually you have the usability
 

1911
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:11,650
at all actually you have the usability
of the high level interface but you have

1912
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:11,660
of the high level interface but you have
 

1913
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,780
of the high level interface but you have
the flexibility of this lower level

1914
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:13,790
the flexibility of this lower level
 

1915
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:16,030
the flexibility of this lower level
interface and you have this spectrum of

1916
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:16,040
interface and you have this spectrum of
 

1917
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:20,250
interface and you have this spectrum of
workflows where you can get more or less

1918
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:20,260
workflows where you can get more or less
 

1919
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:24,540
workflows where you can get more or less
usability and flexibility the trade-offs

1920
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:24,550
usability and flexibility the trade-offs
 

1921
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:27,220
usability and flexibility the trade-offs
depending on your needs right you can

1922
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:27,230
depending on your needs right you can
 

1923
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:30,040
depending on your needs right you can
write everything from scratch and you

1924
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:30,050
write everything from scratch and you
 

1925
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:33,130
write everything from scratch and you
get a lot of help doing so by you know

1926
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:33,140
get a lot of help doing so by you know
 

1927
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,950
get a lot of help doing so by you know
subclassing models and writing some

00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:29,320
to the process I don't know just magic
to the process but there definitely is a

2060
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:29,330
to the process but there definitely is a
 

2061
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:33,820
to the process but there definitely is a
process so making design decision is

2062
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:33,830
process so making design decision is
 

2063
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:35,410
process so making design decision is
about satisfying a set of constraints

2064
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:35,420
about satisfying a set of constraints
 

2065
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:38,920
about satisfying a set of constraints
but also trying to do so in the simplest

2066
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:38,930
but also trying to do so in the simplest
 

2067
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:41,590
but also trying to do so in the simplest
way possible because this is what can be

2068
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:41,600
way possible because this is what can be
 

2069
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,840
way possible because this is what can be
maintained is what can be expanding in

2070
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:43,850
maintained is what can be expanding in
 

2071
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:46,860
maintained is what can be expanding in
the future so you don't want to naively

2072
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:46,870
the future so you don't want to naively
 

2073
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:49,750
the future so you don't want to naively
satisfy the constraints by just you know

2074
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:49,760
satisfy the constraints by just you know
 

2075
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,850
satisfy the constraints by just you know
for each capability you need available

2076
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:51,860
for each capability you need available
 

2077
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:53,260
for each capability you need available
you're gonna come up with one argument

2078
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:53,270
you're gonna come up with one argument
 

2079
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:55,450
you're gonna come up with one argument
new idea and so on you want to design

2080
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:55,460
new idea and so on you want to design
 

2081
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:59,380
new idea and so on you want to design
api's and that are modular and

2082
00:44:59,380 --> 00:44:59,390
api's and that are modular and
 

2083
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:01,780
api's and that are modular and
hierarchical so that they're there they

2084
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:01,790
hierarchical so that they're there they
 

2085
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:05,200
hierarchical so that they're there they
have an API surface that is as small as

2086
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:05,210
have an API surface that is as small as
 

2087
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:09,070
have an API surface that is as small as
possible right and and you want this

2088
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:09,080
possible right and and you want this
 

2089
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,800
possible right and and you want this
modular hierarchical architecture to

2090
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:11,810
modular hierarchical architecture to
 

2091
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:14,140
modular hierarchical architecture to
reflect the way that domain experts

2092
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:14,150
reflect the way that domain experts
 

2093
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:17,260
reflect the way that domain experts
think about the problem because as the

2094
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:17,270
think about the problem because as the
 

2095
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:19,090
think about the problem because as the
men expect when you're reading about a

00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:39,690
you're trying to build as quickly as
 

2115
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:41,660
you're trying to build as quickly as
possible and mapping between the

possible and mapping between the
 

2117
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:43,700

concepts
 

2119
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:46,130
concepts
feature the new API and the concepts in

2120
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:46,140
feature the new API and the concepts in
 

2121
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,690
feature the new API and the concepts in
your mind so you are trying to map your

2122
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:47,700
your mind so you are trying to map your
 

2123
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,930
your mind so you are trying to map your
mental model as a domain expert to the

2124
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:50,940
mental model as a domain expert to the
 

2125
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,290
mental model as a domain expert to the
way things work in the API so you need

2126
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:54,300
way things work in the API so you need
 

2127
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,599
way things work in the API so you need
an API and an underlying implementation

2128
00:45:56,599 --> 00:45:56,609
an API and an underlying implementation
 

2129
00:45:56,609 --> 00:45:59,120
an API and an underlying implementation
that are reflecting the way people think

2130
00:45:59,120 --> 00:45:59,130
that are reflecting the way people think
 

2131
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:00,950
that are reflecting the way people think
about these things so in minimizing the

2132
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:00,960
about these things so in minimizing the
 

2133
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,319
about these things so in minimizing the
time it takes them this mapping yes

2134
00:46:03,319 --> 00:46:03,329
time it takes them this mapping yes
 

2135
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:05,480
time it takes them this mapping yes
minimizing the time the cognitive load

2136
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:05,490
minimizing the time the cognitive load
 

2137
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:09,589
minimizing the time the cognitive load
there is in in just industry knowledge

brilliant so what's the future of

2150
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:25,710
brilliant so what's the future of
 

2151
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:27,829
brilliant so what's the future of
kerosene transfer look like what it

2152
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:27,839
kerosene transfer look like what it
 

2153
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:31,880
kerosene transfer look like what it
stands for 3.0 look like so that's gonna

2154
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:31,890
stands for 3.0 look like so that's gonna
 

2155
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:33,650
stands for 3.0 look like so that's gonna
to fall in the future for me to answer

2156
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:33,660
to fall in the future for me to answer
 

2157
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,500
to fall in the future for me to answer
especially since I'm now I'm not even

2158
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:36,510
especially since I'm now I'm not even
 

2159
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:39,440
especially since I'm now I'm not even
the one making these decisions okay but

2160
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:39,450
the one making these decisions okay but
 

2161
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:41,930
the one making these decisions okay but
so from my perspective which is you know

2162
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:41,940
so from my perspective which is you know
 

2163
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,849
so from my perspective which is you know
just one perspective among many

2164
00:46:43,849 --> 00:46:43,859
just one perspective among many
 

2165
00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:45,500
just one perspective among many
different perspectives on the transferor

2166
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:45,510
different perspectives on the transferor
 

2167
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:49,730
different perspectives on the transferor
team I'm really excited by developing

2168
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:49,740
team I'm really excited by developing
 

2169
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:53,120
team I'm really excited by developing
even higher level api's higher level and

2170
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:53,130
even higher level api's higher level and
 

2171
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:55,099
even higher level api's higher level and
Carols I'm really excited by hyper

2172
00:46:55,099 --> 00:46:55,109
Carols I'm really excited by hyper
 

2173
00:46:55,109 --> 00:46:58,069

learning or two ml I think the future is

2176
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:02,130
learning or two ml I think the future is
 

2177
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:05,170
learning or two ml I think the future is
not just you know defining a model like

2178
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:05,180
not just you know defining a model like
 

2179
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:07,819
not just you know defining a model like
like us and being Lego blocks and then

2180
00:47:07,819 --> 00:47:07,829
like us and being Lego blocks and then
 

2181
00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:12,099
like us and being Lego blocks and then
click fit on it it's more like an

2182
00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:12,109
click fit on it it's more like an
 

2183
00:47:12,109 --> 00:47:14,450
click fit on it it's more like an
automatical model let me just look at

2184
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:14,460
automatical model let me just look at
 

2185
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,359
automatical model let me just look at
your data and optimize the objective

2186
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:17,369
your data and optimize the objective
 

2187
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:21,049
your data and optimize the objective
view after right so that's that's what

2188
00:47:21,049 --> 00:47:21,059
view after right so that's that's what
 

2189
00:47:21,059 --> 00:47:24,319
view after right so that's that's what
what I'm looking - yeah so you put the

2190
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:24,329
what I'm looking - yeah so you put the
 

2191
00:47:24,329 --> 00:47:26,539
what I'm looking - yeah so you put the
baby into a room with the problem and

2192
00:47:26,539 --> 00:47:26,549
baby into a room with the problem and
 

2193
00:47:26,549 --> 00:47:30,109
baby into a room with the problem and
come back a few hours later with a fully

2194
00:47:30,109 --> 00:47:30,119
come back a few hours later with a fully
 

2195
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:31,819
come back a few hours later with a fully
solved problem exactly it's not like a

2196
00:47:31,819 --> 00:47:31,829
solved problem exactly it's not like a
 

2197
00:47:31,829 --> 00:47:34,370
solved problem exactly it's not like a
box of Lego's right it's more like the

2198
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:34,380
box of Lego's right it's more like the
 

2199
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,500
box of Lego's right it's more like the
combination of a kid that's pretty good

2200
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:36,510
combination of a kid that's pretty good
 

2201
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:39,049
combination of a kid that's pretty good
at Legos blocks of Legos yeah it's just

2202
00:47:39,049 --> 00:47:39,059
at Legos blocks of Legos yeah it's just
 

2203
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:40,660
at Legos blocks of Legos yeah it's just
building the thing

2204
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:40,670
building the thing
 

2205
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:43,640
building the thing
very nice so that's that's an exciting

2206
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:43,650
very nice so that's that's an exciting
 

2207
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:44,960
very nice so that's that's an exciting
feature and I think there's a huge

2208
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:44,970
feature and I think there's a huge
 

2209
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:47,750
feature and I think there's a huge
amount of applications and revolutions

2210
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:47,760
amount of applications and revolutions
 

2211
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,870
amount of applications and revolutions
to be had under the constraints of the

2212
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:50,880
to be had under the constraints of the
 

2213
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,720
to be had under the constraints of the
discussion we previously had but what do

is a set of rules so deep learning is
 

2341
00:50:43,209 --> 00:50:45,539
is a set of rules so deep learning is
really like point by point geometric

2342
00:50:45,539 --> 00:50:45,549
really like point by point geometric
 

2343

really like point by point geometric
more things more things train with

00:50:47,529 --> 00:50:51,120
more things more things train with

2347
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:54,509

can generalize much better and I think

2348
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:54,519

2349
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:56,789
can generalize much better and I think
the future is which combine the two so

2350
00:50:56,789 --> 00:50:56,799
the future is which combine the two so
 

2351
00:50:56,799 --> 00:50:59,519
the future is which combine the two so
how do we do you think combine the tools

2352

how do we do you think combine the tools
 

2353
00:50:59,529 --> 00:51:02,219
how do we do you think combine the tools
how do we combine good point by point

2358
00:51:09,689 --> 00:51:09,699
symbolic AI type systems yeah at which
 

2359
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:12,239
symbolic AI type systems yeah at which
levels the combination happen and you

2360
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:12,249
levels the combination happen and you
 

2361
00:51:12,249 --> 00:51:14,759
levels the combination happen and you
know obviously we're jumping into the

2362
00:51:14,759 --> 00:51:14,769
know obviously we're jumping into the
 

2363
00:51:14,769 --> 00:51:16,499

it just kind of ideas and intuitions and

2367
00:51:19,299 --> 00:51:22,049
it just kind of ideas and intuitions and
so on well if you look at the really

2368
00:51:22,049 --> 00:51:22,059
so on well if you look at the really
 

2369
00:51:22,059 --> 00:51:24,719
so on well if you look at the really
successful AI systems today I think they

00:51:24,729 --> 00:51:26,549
successful AI systems today I think they
are already hybrid systems that are

they're using deep learning as
 

2385
00:51:42,309 --> 00:51:44,519
they're using deep learning as

mean let's say still driving itself

2438
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:53,260
mean let's say still driving itself

00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:57,720
mean let's say still driving itself
driving permit for many people but let's

2440
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:57,730
driving permit for many people but let's
 

2441
00:52:57,730 --> 00:52:59,700
driving permit for many people but let's
not even talk about self-driving let's

2442
00:52:59,700 --> 00:52:59,710
not even talk about self-driving let's
 

2443
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:03,060
not even talk about self-driving let's
talk about steering so staying inside

2444

the lane lines following yeah it's

2446
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:06,220
the lane lines following yeah it's
 

2447
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,859
the lane lines following yeah it's
definitely a problem cancel reason and

2448
00:53:07,859 --> 00:53:07,869
definitely a problem cancel reason and
 

2449
00:53:07,869 --> 00:53:09,180
definitely a problem cancel reason and
two in the planning model but that's

2450
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:09,190
two in the planning model but that's
 

2451
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:11,460
two in the planning model but that's
like one small subset on a second

2452
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:11,470
like one small subset on a second
 

2453
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:12,930
like one small subset on a second
yeah I don't like you're jumping from

2454
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:12,940
yeah I don't like you're jumping from
 

2455
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:15,180
yeah I don't like you're jumping from
the extreme so easily because I disagree

2456
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:15,190
the extreme so easily because I disagree
 

2457
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:16,530
the extreme so easily because I disagree
with you on that

2458
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:16,540
with you on that
 

2459
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:20,940
with you on that
I think well it's it's not obvious to me

2460
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:20,950
I think well it's it's not obvious to me
 

2461
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:23,190
I think well it's it's not obvious to me
that you can solve Lane following it's

2462
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:23,200
that you can solve Lane following it's
 

2463
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,840
that you can solve Lane following it's
no it's not it's not obvious I think

2464
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:24,850
no it's not it's not obvious I think
 

2465
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:26,940
no it's not it's not obvious I think
it's doable I think in general you know

2466
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:26,950
it's doable I think in general you know
 

2467
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:31,590
it's doable I think in general you know
there is no hard limitations to what you

2468
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:31,600
there is no hard limitations to what you
 

2469
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,080
there is no hard limitations to what you
can learn with a DP on network as long

2470
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:34,090
can learn with a DP on network as long
 

2471
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:39,870
can learn with a DP on network as long
as this the search space like is rich

2472
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:39,880
as this the search space like is rich
 

2473
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,790
as this the search space like is rich
enough is flexible enough and as long as

2474
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:41,800
enough is flexible enough and as long as
 

2475
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,010
enough is flexible enough and as long as
you have this dense sampling of the

2476
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:44,020
you have this dense sampling of the
 

2477
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,870
you have this dense sampling of the
input cross output space the problem is

2478
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:45,880
input cross output space the problem is
 

2479
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,880
input cross output space the problem is
that you know this dense sampling could

2480
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:47,890
that you know this dense sampling could
 

2481
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:51,240
that you know this dense sampling could
mean anything from 10,000 examples to

2482
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:51,250
mean anything from 10,000 examples to
 

2483
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:53,400
mean anything from 10,000 examples to
like trillions and trillions so that's

2484
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:53,410
like trillions and trillions so that's
 

2485
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:54,840
like trillions and trillions so that's
that's my question so what's your

2486
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:54,850
that's my question so what's your
 

2487
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:58,020
that's my question so what's your
intuition and if you could just give it

2488
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:58,030
intuition and if you could just give it
 

2489
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:00,660
intuition and if you could just give it
a chance and think what kind of problems

2490
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:00,670
a chance and think what kind of problems
 

2491
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:03,000
a chance and think what kind of problems
can be solved by getting a huge amounts

2492
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:03,010
can be solved by getting a huge amounts
 

2493
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:06,930
can be solved by getting a huge amounts
of data and thereby creating a dense

2494
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:06,940
of data and thereby creating a dense
 

2495
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:10,349
of data and thereby creating a dense
mapping so let's think about natural

2496
00:54:10,349 --> 00:54:10,359
mapping so let's think about natural
 

2497
00:54:10,359 --> 00:54:14,160
mapping so let's think about natural
language dialogue the Turing test do you

2498
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:14,170
language dialogue the Turing test do you
 

2499
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:17,220
language dialogue the Turing test do you
think the Turing test can be solved with

2500
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:17,230
think the Turing test can be solved with
 

2501
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:21,450
think the Turing test can be solved with
a neural network alone well the

2502
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:21,460
a neural network alone well the
 

2503
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,880
a neural network alone well the
deterrent test is all about tricking

2504
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:23,890
deterrent test is all about tricking
 

2505
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:26,160

human
 

2509
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:27,860
human
I don't think that's actually very

2510
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:27,870
I don't think that's actually very
 

2511
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:31,160
I don't think that's actually very
difficult because it's more about

2512
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:31,170
difficult because it's more about
 

2513
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:36,060
difficult because it's more about
exploiting a human perception and not so

2514
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:36,070
exploiting a human perception and not so
 

2515
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:37,950
exploiting a human perception and not so
much about intelligence there's a big

2684
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:03,220
algorithms are very promising so I was
 

2685
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:05,069
algorithms are very promising so I was
like genetic programming genic priming

2686
00:58:05,069 --> 00:58:05,079
like genetic programming genic priming
 

2687

like genetic programming genic priming
Zack can you discuss the field of

00:58:07,470 --> 00:58:07,480
Zack can you discuss the field of
 

2689
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:11,190
Zack can you discuss the field of
program synthesis like what how many

2690
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:11,200
program synthesis like what how many
 

2691
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,960
program synthesis like what how many
people are working and thinking about it

00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:12,970
people are working and thinking about it
 

2693
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:16,400
people are working and thinking about it
what where we are in the history

2694
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:16,410
what where we are in the history
 

2695
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:19,230

planning this is like the 90s so meaning

2700
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:25,180
planning this is like the 90s so meaning
 

2701
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:26,760
planning this is like the 90s so meaning
that already have we already have

have some basic understanding of where
this is about but it still I feel that

00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:36,700
this is about but it still I feel that
 

2709
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,760
this is about but it still I feel that

few samples to excel what it's able to
 

2735
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:14,190
few samples to excel what it's able to
figure out like just giving it a few

2736
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:14,200
figure out like just giving it a few
 

2737
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,650
figure out like just giving it a few
dates mm-hmm what are you able to figure

2738
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:16,660
dates mm-hmm what are you able to figure
 

2739
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:18,150
dates mm-hmm what are you able to figure
out from the pattern I just gave you

2740
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:18,160
out from the pattern I just gave you
 

2741
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,800
out from the pattern I just gave you
it's just a fascinating question and

2742
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:19,810
it's just a fascinating question and
 

2743
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:21,030
it's just a fascinating question and
it's fascinating whether that's learn

2744
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:21,040
it's fascinating whether that's learn
 

2745
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,820
it's fascinating whether that's learn
about the patterns and you're saying

2746
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:23,830
about the patterns and you're saying
 

2747
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:25,920
about the patterns and you're saying
they're working on that yeah how big is

2748
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:25,930
they're working on that yeah how big is
 

2749
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:28,770
they're working on that yeah how big is
the toolbox currently are we completely

the toolbox currently are we completely
in the dark so if you said enjoying the

00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:30,370
in the dark so if you said enjoying the
 

2753
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:35,370

in terms of provinces no I would say so

2754
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:35,380
in terms of provinces no I would say so
 

2755
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:37,080
in terms of provinces no I would say so
maybe not even even too optimistic

2756
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:37,090
maybe not even even too optimistic
 

2757
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:39,090
maybe not even even too optimistic
because by the nineties you know we

2758
00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:39,100
because by the nineties you know we
 

2759
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:41,370
because by the nineties you know we
already understood that prop we already

2760
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:41,380
already understood that prop we already
 

2761
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:43,350
already understood that prop we already
understood you know the engine of

2762
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:43,360
understood you know the engine of
 

2763
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:44,700
understood you know the engine of
deplaning even though we couldn't

2764
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:44,710
deplaning even though we couldn't
 

2765
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:47,550
deplaning even though we couldn't
release its potential quite today I

2766
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:47,560
release its potential quite today I
 

2767
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,140
release its potential quite today I
don't think we've found the engine of

00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:49,150
don't think we've found the engine of
 

2769
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:50,850
don't think we've found the engine of
problems into this so we're in the

2770
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:50,860
problems into this so we're in the
 

2771
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:54,800
problems into this so we're in the
winter before backprop yeah anyway yes

00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:54,810
winter before backprop yeah anyway yes
 

2773
00:59:54,810 --> 00:59:58,530

00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:00,930
so I do believe program synthesis in

01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,839
get straight to the point is it's
probably true and so you say that you

01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:07,849
probably true and so you say that you
 

2833
01:01:07,849 --> 01:01:10,150
probably true and so you say that you

01:04:35,590 --> 01:04:35,600
computation are ultimately the most
 

2997
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:39,220
computation are ultimately the most
effective so as opposed to figuring out

2998
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:39,230
effective so as opposed to figuring out
 

2999
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:41,050
effective so as opposed to figuring out
methods that can generalize effectively

3000
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:41,060
methods that can generalize effectively
 

3001
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:46,750
methods that can generalize effectively
do you think we can get pretty far by

3002
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:46,760
do you think we can get pretty far by
 

3003
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:48,460
do you think we can get pretty far by
just having something that leverages

3004
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:48,470
just having something that leverages
 

3005
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:50,770
just having something that leverages
computation than the improvement of

3006
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:50,780
computation than the improvement of
 

3007
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:52,450
computation than the improvement of
computation yes so I think rich is

3008
01:04:52,450 --> 01:04:52,460
computation yes so I think rich is
 

3009
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:55,480
computation yes so I think rich is
making very good points which is that a

3010
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:55,490
making very good points which is that a
 

3011
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:57,460
making very good points which is that a
lot of these papers which are actually

3012
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:57,470
lot of these papers which are actually
 

3013
01:04:57,470 --> 01:05:01,240
lot of these papers which are actually
all about manually hot coding prior

3014
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:01,250
all about manually hot coding prior
 

3015
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:03,400
all about manually hot coding prior
knowledge about the task into some

3016
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:03,410
knowledge about the task into some
 

3017
01:05:03,410 --> 01:05:05,230
knowledge about the task into some
system doesn't have to be deep in

3018
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:05,240

3019
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:07,380
system doesn't have to be deep in
architecture but into some system right

3020
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:07,390
architecture but into some system right
 

3021
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:09,850
architecture but into some system right
you know is these papers are not

3022
01:05:09,850 --> 01:05:09,860
you know is these papers are not
 

3023
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:12,250
you know is these papers are not
actually making any impact instead

3024
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:12,260
actually making any impact instead
 

3025
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:14,710
actually making any impact instead
what's making real long-term impact is

3026
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:14,720
what's making real long-term impact is
 

3027
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:18,700
what's making real long-term impact is
very simple very general systems that

3028
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:18,710
very simple very general systems that
 

3029
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:21,400
very simple very general systems that
are agnostic to all these tricks because

3030
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:21,410
are agnostic to all these tricks because
 

3031
01:05:21,410 --> 01:05:23,230
are agnostic to all these tricks because
districts do not generalize

3032
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:23,240
districts do not generalize
 

3033
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:26,980
districts do not generalize
and of course the one general and simple

3034
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:26,990
and of course the one general and simple
 

3035
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:31,270
and of course the one general and simple
thing that you should focus on is that

3036
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:31,280
thing that you should focus on is that
 

3037
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,400
thing that you should focus on is that
which leverages computation because

3038
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:33,410
which leverages computation because
 

3039
01:05:33,410 --> 01:05:36,190
which leverages computation because
computation the availability of

3040
01:05:36,190 --> 01:05:36,200
computation the availability of
 

3041
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,780
computation the availability of
large-scale computation has been you

3042
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:37,790
large-scale computation has been you
 

3043
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:39,700
large-scale computation has been you
know increasing exponentially following

3044
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:39,710
know increasing exponentially following
 

3045
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:42,609
know increasing exponentially following
Moore's law so if your algorithm is all

3046
01:05:42,609 --> 01:05:42,619
Moore's law so if your algorithm is all
 

3047
01:05:42,619 --> 01:05:44,650
Moore's law so if your algorithm is all
about exploiting this the new algorithm

3048
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:44,660
about exploiting this the new algorithm
 

3049
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:46,270
about exploiting this the new algorithm
is suddenly exponentially improving

3050
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:46,280
is suddenly exponentially improving
 

3051
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:50,500
is suddenly exponentially improving
right so I think rich is definitely

3052
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:50,510
right so I think rich is definitely
 

3053
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:55,720
right so I think rich is definitely
right either you know is right about the

3054
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:55,730
right either you know is right about the
 

3055
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:58,750
right either you know is right about the
past 70 years is regressing the past 70

3056
01:05:58,750 --> 01:05:58,760
past 70 years is regressing the past 70
 

3057
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:01,390
past 70 years is regressing the past 70
years I am Not sure that this assessment

3061
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,880

years it's it's might to some extent I

3062

3063
01:06:06,890 --> 01:06:10,570
years it's it's might to some extent I
suspect it will not because the truth of

3064
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:10,580
suspect it will not because the truth of

3067
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:15,550

3071
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:19,930

changing like Moore's law might not be

3072
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:19,940
changing like Moore's law might not be
 

3073
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:22,750
changing like Moore's law might not be

future and I do believe that you know

3076
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:26,300
future and I do believe that you know
 

3077
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:30,220

when you when you we need to pick one

3078

starts becoming the bottleneck let's say

3084
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:36,830
starts becoming the bottleneck let's say
 

3085
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:39,250
starts becoming the bottleneck let's say
you have unlimited competition well then

3086
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:39,260
you have unlimited competition well then
 

3087
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:42,040
you have unlimited competition well then
data is the bottleneck and I think we

3088
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:42,050
data is the bottleneck and I think we
 

3089
01:06:42,050 --> 01:06:44,320
data is the bottleneck and I think we
are already starting to be in a regime

3090
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:44,330
are already starting to be in a regime
 

3091
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:47,020
are already starting to be in a regime
where our systems are so large in scale

3092
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:47,030
where our systems are so large in scale
 

3093
01:06:47,030 --> 01:06:49,450
where our systems are so large in scale
and so data and grain the data today and

3094
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:49,460
and so data and grain the data today and
 

3095
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:51,820
and so data and grain the data today and
quality of data and the scale of data is

3096
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:51,830
quality of data and the scale of data is
 

3097
01:06:51,830 --> 01:06:54,810
quality of data and the scale of data is
the bottleneck and in this environment

3098
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:54,820
the bottleneck and in this environment
 

3099
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:58,630
the bottleneck and in this environment
the the bitter lesson from rich is it's

3100
01:06:58,630 --> 01:06:58,640
the the bitter lesson from rich is it's
 

3101
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,609
the the bitter lesson from rich is it's
not going to be true anymore right all

3102
01:07:00,609 --> 01:07:00,619
not going to be true anymore right all
 

3103
01:07:00,619 --> 01:07:03,460
not going to be true anymore right all
right so I think we are gonna move from

3104
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:03,470
right so I think we are gonna move from
 

3105
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:06,880
right so I think we are gonna move from
a focus on a scale of a competition

3106
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:06,890
a focus on a scale of a competition
 

3107
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:10,030
a focus on a scale of a competition
scale to focus on data efficiency their

3108
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:10,040
scale to focus on data efficiency their
 

3109
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,040
scale to focus on data efficiency their
efficiency so that's getting to this the

3110
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:12,050
efficiency so that's getting to this the
 

3111
01:07:12,050 --> 01:07:13,720
efficiency so that's getting to this the
question is symbolic AI but to linger on

3112
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:13,730
question is symbolic AI but to linger on
 

3113
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:16,690
question is symbolic AI but to linger on
the deep learning approaches do you have

3114
01:07:16,690 --> 01:07:16,700
the deep learning approaches do you have
 

3115
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:19,359
the deep learning approaches do you have
hope for either unsupervised learning or

3116
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:19,369
hope for either unsupervised learning or
 

3117
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:25,870
hope for either unsupervised learning or
reinforcement learning which are ways of

3118
01:07:25,870 --> 01:07:25,880
reinforcement learning which are ways of
 

3119
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:28,209
reinforcement learning which are ways of
being more data efficient in terms of

3120
01:07:28,209 --> 01:07:28,219
being more data efficient in terms of
 

3121
01:07:28,219 --> 01:07:29,769
being more data efficient in terms of
the amount of data they need that

3122
01:07:29,769 --> 01:07:29,779
the amount of data they need that
 

3123
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:32,229
the amount of data they need that
required human annotation so in

01:07:32,229 --> 01:07:32,239
required human annotation so in
 

3125
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:33,400

3141
01:07:48,589 --> 01:07:51,279

3283
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:19,799

possibility yeah so you're talking about

3284
01:11:19,799 --> 01:11:19,809
possibility yeah so you're talking about
 

3285
01:11:19,809 --> 01:11:22,290
possibility yeah so you're talking about
any kind of recommender system let's

3286
01:11:22,290 --> 01:11:22,300
any kind of recommender system let's
 

3287
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:25,830
any kind of recommender system let's
look at the YouTube algorithm Facebook

3288
01:11:25,830 --> 01:11:25,840
look at the YouTube algorithm Facebook
 

3289
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:28,020
look at the YouTube algorithm Facebook
anything that recommends content you

3290
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:28,030
anything that recommends content you
 

3291
01:11:28,030 --> 01:11:28,770
anything that recommends content you
should watch next

3292
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:28,780
should watch next
 

3293
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:32,699
should watch next
yeah and it's fascinating to think that

3294
01:11:32,699 --> 01:11:32,709
yeah and it's fascinating to think that
 

3295
01:11:32,709 --> 01:11:34,669
yeah and it's fascinating to think that
there's some aspects of human behavior

3296
01:11:34,669 --> 01:11:34,679
there's some aspects of human behavior
 

3297
01:11:34,679 --> 01:11:40,199
there's some aspects of human behavior
that you can you know say a problem of

3298
01:11:40,199 --> 01:11:40,209
that you can you know say a problem of
 

3299
01:11:40,209 --> 01:11:43,379
that you can you know say a problem of
is this person hold the republican

3300
01:11:43,379 --> 01:11:43,389
is this person hold the republican
 

3301
01:11:43,389 --> 01:11:45,629
is this person hold the republican
beliefs the Democratic beliefs and this

3302
01:11:45,629 --> 01:11:45,639
beliefs the Democratic beliefs and this
 

3303
01:11:45,639 --> 01:11:48,899
beliefs the Democratic beliefs and this
is but trivial that's an objective

3304
01:11:48,899 --> 01:11:48,909
is but trivial that's an objective
 

3305
01:11:48,909 --> 01:11:51,930
is but trivial that's an objective
function and you can optimize and you

3306
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:51,940
function and you can optimize and you
 

3307
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:53,459
function and you can optimize and you
can measure and you can turn everybody

3308
01:11:53,459 --> 01:11:53,469
can measure and you can turn everybody
 

3309
01:11:53,469 --> 01:11:54,719
can measure and you can turn everybody
into a Republican or everybody

3310
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:54,729
into a Republican or everybody
 

3311
01:11:54,729 --> 01:11:57,180
into a Republican or everybody

3470
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:49,560
creates division and and and destruction
 

3471
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:53,479
creates division and and and destruction
civil war a lot of bad stuff and the

3472
01:15:53,479 --> 01:15:53,489
civil war a lot of bad stuff and the
 

3473
01:15:53,489 --> 01:15:56,810
civil war a lot of bad stuff and the
worry is naturally probably that space

3474
01:15:56,810 --> 01:15:56,820
worry is naturally probably that space
 

3475
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:59,990
worry is naturally probably that space
is bigger first of all and if we don't

3476
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:00,000
is bigger first of all and if we don't
 

3477
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,729
is bigger first of all and if we don't
explicitly think about what kind of

3478
01:16:03,729 --> 01:16:03,739
explicitly think about what kind of
 

3479
01:16:03,739 --> 01:16:06,919
explicitly think about what kind of
effects are going to be observed from

3480
01:16:06,919 --> 01:16:06,929
effects are going to be observed from
 

3481
01:16:06,929 --> 01:16:08,540
effects are going to be observed from
different objective functions then we

3482
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:08,550
different objective functions then we
 

3483
01:16:08,550 --> 01:16:10,850
different objective functions then we
can get into trouble but the question is

3484
01:16:10,850 --> 01:16:10,860
can get into trouble but the question is
 

3485
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:14,240
can get into trouble but the question is
how do we how do we get into rooms and

3486
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:14,250
how do we how do we get into rooms and
 

3487
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:17,959
how do we how do we get into rooms and
have discussions so inside Google inside

3488
01:16:17,959 --> 01:16:17,969
have discussions so inside Google inside
 

3489
01:16:17,969 --> 01:16:20,930
have discussions so inside Google inside
Facebook inside Twitter and think about

3490
01:16:20,930 --> 01:16:20,940
Facebook inside Twitter and think about
 

3491
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:23,660
Facebook inside Twitter and think about
okay how can we drive up engagement and

3492
01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:23,670
okay how can we drive up engagement and
 

3493
01:16:23,670 --> 01:16:27,080
okay how can we drive up engagement and
at the same time create a good society

3494
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:27,090
at the same time create a good society
 

3495
01:16:27,090 --> 01:16:29,270
at the same time create a good society
is there is it even possible to have

3496
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:29,280
is there is it even possible to have
 

3497
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,040
is there is it even possible to have
that kind of philosophical discussion I

3498
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:31,050
that kind of philosophical discussion I
 

3499
01:16:31,050 --> 01:16:33,620
that kind of philosophical discussion I
think you can different try so from my

3500
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:33,630
think you can different try so from my
 

3501
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:35,780
think you can different try so from my
perspective I would feel rather

3502
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:35,790
perspective I would feel rather
 

3503
01:16:35,790 --> 01:16:39,770

maybe I want to maximize learning about

3542
01:17:28,490 --> 01:17:28,500
maybe I want to maximize learning about
 

3543
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:31,250
maybe I want to maximize learning about
a specific topic right so I want the

3544
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:31,260
a specific topic right so I want the
 

3545
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:36,470
a specific topic right so I want the
algorithm to feed my curiosity right

3546
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:36,480
algorithm to feed my curiosity right
 

3547
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,330
algorithm to feed my curiosity right
which is in itself a very interesting

3548
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:38,340
which is in itself a very interesting
 

3549
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:40,070
which is in itself a very interesting
problem so instead of maximizing my

3550
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:40,080
problem so instead of maximizing my
 

3551
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,770
problem so instead of maximizing my
engagement it will maximize half fast

3552
01:17:42,770 --> 01:17:42,780
engagement it will maximize half fast
 

3553
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:45,290
engagement it will maximize half fast
and how much I'm learning and it will

01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:45,300
and how much I'm learning and it will
 

3555
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:46,940
and how much I'm learning and it will
also take into account the accuracy

also take into account the accuracy
hopefully you know if the information

hopefully you know if the information
I'm learning so yeah the user should be

01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:55,940
I'm learning so yeah the user should be

I want I want technology so aii these

you know their own personal growth goals

3588
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:37,050
you know their own personal growth goals
 

3589
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:39,800
you know their own personal growth goals
they should be able to configure

3590
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:39,810
they should be able to configure
 

3591
01:18:39,810 --> 01:18:42,770
they should be able to configure
algorithms in such a way yeah but so I

3592
01:18:42,770 --> 01:18:42,780
algorithms in such a way yeah but so I
 

3593
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:45,890
algorithms in such a way yeah but so I
know it's painful to have explicit

3594
01:18:45,890 --> 01:18:45,900
know it's painful to have explicit
 

3595
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:49,480
know it's painful to have explicit
decisions but there is underlying

3596
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:49,490
decisions but there is underlying
 

3597
01:18:49,490 --> 01:18:51,770
decisions but there is underlying
explicit decisions which is some of the

3598
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:51,780
explicit decisions which is some of the
 

3599
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:54,250
explicit decisions which is some of the
most beautiful fundamental philosophy

3600
01:18:54,250 --> 01:18:54,260
most beautiful fundamental philosophy
 

3601
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:58,750
most beautiful fundamental philosophy
that that we have before us which is

3602
01:18:58,750 --> 01:18:58,760
that that we have before us which is
 

3603
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:02,570
that that we have before us which is
personal growth if I want to watch

3604
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:02,580
personal growth if I want to watch
 

3605
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:06,110
personal growth if I want to watch
videos from which I can learn what does

3606
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:06,120
videos from which I can learn what does
 

3607
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:09,140
videos from which I can learn what does
that mean so if I have a check box that

3608
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:09,150
that mean so if I have a check box that
 

3609
01:19:09,150 --> 01:19:12,050
that mean so if I have a check box that
wants to emphasize learning there's

3610
01:19:12,050 --> 01:19:12,060
wants to emphasize learning there's
 

3611
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:14,000
wants to emphasize learning there's
still an algorithm with explicit

3612
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:14,010
still an algorithm with explicit
 

3613
01:19:14,010 --> 01:19:15,950
still an algorithm with explicit
decisions in it that would promote

3614
01:19:15,950 --> 01:19:15,960
decisions in it that would promote
 

3615
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:19,010
decisions in it that would promote
learning what does that mean for me

3616
01:19:19,010 --> 01:19:19,020
learning what does that mean for me
 

3617
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:20,090
learning what does that mean for me
like for example I've watched a

3618
01:19:20,090 --> 01:19:20,100
like for example I've watched a
 

3619
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:23,300
like for example I've watched a
documentary on Flat Earth theory I guess

3620
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:23,310
documentary on Flat Earth theory I guess
 

3621
01:19:23,310 --> 01:19:27,860
documentary on Flat Earth theory I guess
a it was very like that I learned a lot

3622
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:27,870
a it was very like that I learned a lot
 

3623
01:19:27,870 --> 01:19:30,410
a it was very like that I learned a lot
I really glad I watched it was a friend

3624
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:30,420
I really glad I watched it was a friend
 

3625
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:32,650
I really glad I watched it was a friend
recommended it to me not

3626
01:19:32,650 --> 01:19:32,660
recommended it to me not
 

3627
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:34,570
recommended it to me not
I don't have such an allergic reaction

3628
01:19:34,570 --> 01:19:34,580
I don't have such an allergic reaction
 

3629
01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:37,480
I don't have such an allergic reaction
to crazy people as my fellow colleagues

3630
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:37,490
to crazy people as my fellow colleagues
 

3631
01:19:37,490 --> 01:19:39,280
to crazy people as my fellow colleagues
do but it was very well it was very

3632
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:39,290
do but it was very well it was very
 

3633
01:19:39,290 --> 01:19:40,060
do but it was very well it was very
eye-opening

3634
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:40,070
eye-opening
 

3635
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:42,310
eye-opening
and for others it might not be from

3636
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:42,320
and for others it might not be from
 

3637
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,920
and for others it might not be from
others they might just get turned off

3638
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:44,930
others they might just get turned off
 

3639
01:19:44,930 --> 01:19:46,390
others they might just get turned off
for that same with a Republican Democrat

3640
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:46,400
for that same with a Republican Democrat
 

3641
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:50,380
for that same with a Republican Democrat
and what it's a non-trivial problem when

3642
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:50,390
and what it's a non-trivial problem when
 

3643
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:53,230
and what it's a non-trivial problem when
first of all if it's done well I don't

3644
01:19:53,230 --> 01:19:53,240
first of all if it's done well I don't
 

3645
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:56,020
first of all if it's done well I don't
think it's something that wouldn't

3646
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:56,030
think it's something that wouldn't
 

3647
01:19:56,030 --> 01:19:58,780
think it's something that wouldn't
happen that the youtubes wouldn't be

3648
01:19:58,780 --> 01:19:58,790
happen that the youtubes wouldn't be
 

3649
01:19:58,790 --> 01:20:00,190
happen that the youtubes wouldn't be
promoting or Twitter wouldn't be it's

3650
01:20:00,190 --> 01:20:00,200
promoting or Twitter wouldn't be it's
 

3651
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,470
promoting or Twitter wouldn't be it's
just a really difficult problem how do

3652
01:20:02,470 --> 01:20:02,480
just a really difficult problem how do
 

3653
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:05,680
just a really difficult problem how do
we do how to give people control well

3654
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:05,690
we do how to give people control well
 

3655
01:20:05,690 --> 01:20:07,990
we do how to give people control well
it's mostly an interface design problem

3656
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:08,000
it's mostly an interface design problem
 

3657
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,360
it's mostly an interface design problem
right the way since you want to create

doing what you want you should be able
 

3673
01:20:32,450 --> 01:20:34,060
doing what you want you should be able
to switch to different algorithm you

3674
01:20:34,060 --> 01:20:34,070
to switch to different algorithm you
 

3675
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:36,760
to switch to different algorithm you
know so that fine-tuned control you kind

3676
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:36,770
know so that fine-tuned control you kind
 

3677

of learn you're trusting the human

3678
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:39,260
of learn you're trusting the human
 

3679
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:40,870
of learn you're trusting the human
collaboration and that's how I see

3680
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:40,880
collaboration and that's how I see
 

3681
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:43,180
collaboration and that's how I see
autonomous vehicles too is giving as

3682
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:43,190
autonomous vehicles too is giving as
 

3683
01:20:43,190 --> 01:20:44,710
autonomous vehicles too is giving as
much information as possible and you

3684
01:20:44,710 --> 01:20:44,720
much information as possible and you
 

3685
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:48,340

learn that dance yourself mmm yeah Adobe

3686
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:48,350
learn that dance yourself mmm yeah Adobe
 

3687
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:50,590
learn that dance yourself mmm yeah Adobe
I don't use Adobe products like

3688
01:20:50,590 --> 01:20:50,600
I don't use Adobe products like
 

3689
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:53,410
I don't use Adobe products like
Photoshop yeah they're trying to see if

3690
01:20:53,410 --> 01:20:53,420
Photoshop yeah they're trying to see if
 

3691
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:55,510
Photoshop yeah they're trying to see if
they can inject YouTube into their

3692
01:20:55,510 --> 01:20:55,520
they can inject YouTube into their
 

3693
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:57,250
they can inject YouTube into their
interface but basically allow you to

3694
01:20:57,250 --> 01:20:57,260
interface but basically allow you to
 

3695
01:20:57,260 --> 01:21:00,670
interface but basically allow you to
show you all these videos that cuz

3696
01:21:00,670 --> 01:21:00,680
show you all these videos that cuz
 

3697
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:02,140
show you all these videos that cuz
everybody's confused about what to do

3698
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:02,150
everybody's confused about what to do
 

3699
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:04,870
everybody's confused about what to do
with feature so basically teach people

3700
01:21:04,870 --> 01:21:04,880
with feature so basically teach people
 

3701
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:08,050
with feature so basically teach people
by linking to and that way it's an

3702
01:21:08,050 --> 01:21:08,060
by linking to and that way it's an
 

3703
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:10,390
by linking to and that way it's an
assistant that shows users videos as a

3704
01:21:10,390 --> 01:21:10,400
assistant that shows users videos as a
 

3705
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,760
assistant that shows users videos as a
basic element of information yeah

3706
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:12,770
basic element of information yeah
 

3707
01:21:12,770 --> 01:21:17,470
basic element of information yeah
okay so what practically should people

3708
01:21:17,470 --> 01:21:17,480
okay so what practically should people
 

3709
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:22,060
okay so what practically should people
do to try to to try to fight against

3710
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:22,070
do to try to to try to fight against
 

3711
01:21:22,070 --> 01:21:24,880
do to try to to try to fight against
abuses of these algorithms or algorithms

3712
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:24,890
abuses of these algorithms or algorithms
 

3713
01:21:24,890 --> 01:21:28,420
abuses of these algorithms or algorithms
that manipulate us us it's a very very

3714
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:28,430
that manipulate us us it's a very very
 

3715
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:30,100
that manipulate us us it's a very very
difficult problem because the star is

3716
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:30,110
difficult problem because the star is
 

3717
01:21:30,110 --> 01:21:33,100
difficult problem because the star is
very little public awareness of these

3718
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:33,110
very little public awareness of these
 

3719
01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:35,920
very little public awareness of these
issues there are a few people would

3720
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:35,930
issues there are a few people would
 

3721
01:21:35,930 --> 01:21:38,650
issues there are a few people would
think as you know anything wrong with

3722
01:21:38,650 --> 01:21:38,660
think as you know anything wrong with
 

3723
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:40,120
think as you know anything wrong with
their news feed algorithm even though

3724
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:40,130
their news feed algorithm even though
 

3725
01:21:40,130 --> 01:21:41,560
their news feed algorithm even though
there is actually something wrong

3726
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:41,570
there is actually something wrong
 

3727
01:21:41,570 --> 01:21:43,150
there is actually something wrong
already which is that it's trying to

3728
01:21:43,150 --> 01:21:43,160
already which is that it's trying to
 

3729
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:45,100
already which is that it's trying to
maximize engagement rest of the time

3730
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:45,110
maximize engagement rest of the time
 

3731
01:21:45,110 --> 01:21:45,870
maximize engagement rest of the time
which

3732
01:21:45,870 --> 01:21:45,880
which
 

3733
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:50,689
which
as a very negative side effects right so

3734
01:21:50,689 --> 01:21:50,699
as a very negative side effects right so
 

3735
01:21:50,699 --> 01:21:54,470
as a very negative side effects right so
ideally so the very first thing is to

3736
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:54,480
ideally so the very first thing is to
 

3737
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:57,899
ideally so the very first thing is to
stop trying to purely maximize

3738
01:21:57,899 --> 01:21:57,909
stop trying to purely maximize
 

3739
01:21:57,909 --> 01:22:01,290
stop trying to purely maximize
engagement try to propagate contents

3740
01:22:01,290 --> 01:22:01,300
engagement try to propagate contents
 

3741
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:07,439
engagement try to propagate contents
based on popularity right instead take

3742
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:07,449
based on popularity right instead take
 

3743
01:22:07,449 --> 01:22:11,790
based on popularity right instead take
into account the goals and the profiles

3744
01:22:11,790 --> 01:22:11,800
into account the goals and the profiles
 

3745
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:15,689
into account the goals and the profiles
of each user so you will you will be one

3746
01:22:15,689 --> 01:22:15,699
of each user so you will you will be one
 

3747
01:22:15,699 --> 01:22:18,470
of each user so you will you will be one
example is for instance when I look at

3748
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:18,480
example is for instance when I look at
 

3749
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,939
example is for instance when I look at
tactic recommendations on Twitter's like

3750
01:22:20,939 --> 01:22:20,949
tactic recommendations on Twitter's like
 

3751
01:22:20,949 --> 01:22:24,209
tactic recommendations on Twitter's like
you know they have this a news tab where

3752
01:22:24,209 --> 01:22:24,219
you know they have this a news tab where
 

3753
01:22:24,219 --> 01:22:25,590
you know they have this a news tab where
I will switch recommendations it's

3754
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:25,600
I will switch recommendations it's
 

3755
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:28,890
I will switch recommendations it's
always the worst garbage because it's

3756
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:28,900
always the worst garbage because it's
 

3757
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:32,669
always the worst garbage because it's
it's content that appeals to them the

3758
01:22:32,669 --> 01:22:32,679
it's content that appeals to them the
 

3759
01:22:32,679 --> 01:22:34,470
it's content that appeals to them the
smallest common denominator to all

3760
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:34,480
smallest common denominator to all
 

3761
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,120
smallest common denominator to all
Twitter users because they are trying to

3762
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:36,130
Twitter users because they are trying to
 

3763
01:22:36,130 --> 01:22:37,950
Twitter users because they are trying to
optimize the purely trying to

3764
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:37,960
optimize the purely trying to
 

3765
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:39,510
optimize the purely trying to
opportunist popularity the purely

01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,430
opportunist popularity the purely
friendship you know as an engagement but

3768
01:22:41,430 --> 01:22:41,440
friendship you know as an engagement but
 

3769
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:43,500
friendship you know as an engagement but
that's not what I want so this should

3770
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:43,510
that's not what I want so this should
 

3771
01:22:43,510 --> 01:22:46,290
that's not what I want so this should
put me in control of some setting so

3772
01:22:46,290 --> 01:22:46,300
put me in control of some setting so
 

3773
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:49,189
put me in control of some setting so
that I define was the objective function

3774
01:22:49,189 --> 01:22:49,199
that I define was the objective function
 

3775
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:51,540
that I define was the objective function
and the twitter is going to be following

3776
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:51,550
and the twitter is going to be following
 

3777
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:54,990
and the twitter is going to be following
- to show me this cannon so and honestly

3778
01:22:54,990 --> 01:22:55,000
- to show me this cannon so and honestly
 

3779
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,820
- to show me this cannon so and honestly
so this is all about interface design

3780
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:56,830
so this is all about interface design
 

3781
01:22:56,830 --> 01:22:59,129
so this is all about interface design
and we are not where it's not realistic

3782
01:22:59,129 --> 01:22:59,139
and we are not where it's not realistic
 

3783
01:22:59,139 --> 01:23:01,110
and we are not where it's not realistic

3945
01:26:42,190 --> 01:26:44,879

we're still in this period a very fast

4099
01:29:57,269 --> 01:30:01,449
with my humaneness so imagine that I was
in fact a robot so what does that mean

4100
01:30:01,449 --> 01:30:01,459
in fact a robot so what does that mean
 

4101
01:30:01,459 --> 01:30:03,589

I'm impressing you with natural language

4102
01:30:03,589 --> 01:30:03,599
I'm impressing you with natural language
 

4103
01:30:03,599 --> 01:30:05,899
I'm impressing you with natural language
processing maybe if you weren't able to

4104
01:30:05,899 --> 01:30:05,909
processing maybe if you weren't able to
 

4105
01:30:05,909 --> 01:30:08,029

see me maybe this is a phone call yes

4106
01:30:08,029 --> 01:30:08,039
see me maybe this is a phone call yes
 

4107
01:30:08,039 --> 01:30:11,750
see me maybe this is a phone call yes
Zack okay so companion so that that's

4108
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:11,760
Zack okay so companion so that that's
 

4109
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:14,209

very much about building human-like AI

4110
01:30:14,209 --> 01:30:14,219
very much about building human-like AI
 

4111
01:30:14,219 --> 01:30:16,790
very much about building human-like AI
and you're asking me you know is this is

4112
01:30:16,790 --> 01:30:16,800
and you're asking me you know is this is
 

4113
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,759
and you're asking me you know is this is
this an exciting perspective yes I think

4114
01:30:19,759 --> 01:30:19,769
this an exciting perspective yes I think
 

4115
01:30:19,769 --> 01:30:24,669
this an exciting perspective yes I think
so yes not so much because of what I

4116
01:30:24,669 --> 01:30:24,679
so yes not so much because of what I
 

4117
01:30:24,679 --> 01:30:27,679
so yes not so much because of what I
artificial human-like intelligence could

4118
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:27,689
artificial human-like intelligence could
 

4119
01:30:27,689 --> 01:30:30,169
artificial human-like intelligence could
do but you know from an intellectual

4120
01:30:30,169 --> 01:30:30,179
do but you know from an intellectual
 

4121
01:30:30,179 --> 01:30:31,790
do but you know from an intellectual
perspective I think if you could build

4122
01:30:31,790 --> 01:30:31,800
perspective I think if you could build
 

4123
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:34,250
perspective I think if you could build
truly human right intelligence that

4124
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:34,260
truly human right intelligence that
 

4125
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:35,870
truly human right intelligence that
means you could actually understand

4126
01:30:35,870 --> 01:30:35,880
means you could actually understand
 

4127
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:38,179
means you could actually understand
human intelligence which is fascinating

4128
01:30:38,179 --> 01:30:38,189
human intelligence which is fascinating
 

4129
01:30:38,189 --> 01:30:38,750
human intelligence which is fascinating
right

4130
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:38,760
right
 

4131
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:41,330
right
yeah human-like intelligence is gonna

4132
01:30:41,330 --> 01:30:41,340
yeah human-like intelligence is gonna
 

4133
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:43,190
yeah human-like intelligence is gonna
require emotions it's gonna require

4134
01:30:43,190 --> 01:30:43,200
require emotions it's gonna require
 

4135
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:45,260
require emotions it's gonna require
consciousness which is not things that

of artificial AR in artificial
intelligence in the sense that it is

4256
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:29,190
intelligence in the sense that it is
 

4257
01:33:29,190 --> 01:33:31,280
intelligence in the sense that it is
solving problems this is a community

4258
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:31,290
solving problems this is a community
 

4259
01:33:31,290 --> 01:33:34,300
solving problems this is a community
knowledge creating a solutions and so on

4260
01:33:34,300 --> 01:33:34,310
knowledge creating a solutions and so on
 

4261
01:33:34,310 --> 01:33:38,060
knowledge creating a solutions and so on
so if you're not explicitly implementing

4262
01:33:38,060 --> 01:33:38,070
so if you're not explicitly implementing
 

4263
01:33:38,070 --> 01:33:40,090
so if you're not explicitly implementing
a subjective experience implementing

4264
01:33:40,090 --> 01:33:40,100
a subjective experience implementing
 

4265
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:43,130
a subjective experience implementing
certain emotions and implementing

4266
01:33:43,130 --> 01:33:43,140
certain emotions and implementing
 

4267
01:33:43,140 --> 01:33:45,500
certain emotions and implementing
consciousness it's not going to just

4268
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:45,510
consciousness it's not going to just
 

4269
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:49,220
consciousness it's not going to just
spontaneously emerge yeah but so for

4270
01:33:49,220 --> 01:33:49,230
spontaneously emerge yeah but so for
 

4271
01:33:49,230 --> 01:33:51,020
spontaneously emerge yeah but so for
system like human-like intelligence

4272
01:33:51,020 --> 01:33:51,030
system like human-like intelligence
 

4273
01:33:51,030 --> 01:33:53,480
system like human-like intelligence
system that has consciousness yeah do

4274
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:53,490
system that has consciousness yeah do
 

4275
01:33:53,490 --> 01:33:56,180
system that has consciousness yeah do
you think he needs to have a body yeah

4276
01:33:56,180 --> 01:33:56,190
you think he needs to have a body yeah
 

4277
01:33:56,190 --> 01:33:57,530
you think he needs to have a body yeah
it's definitely I mean doesn't have to

4278
01:33:57,530 --> 01:33:57,540
it's definitely I mean doesn't have to
 

4279
01:33:57,540 --> 01:34:00,290
it's definitely I mean doesn't have to
be a physical body right and there's not

4280
01:34:00,290 --> 01:34:00,300
be a physical body right and there's not
 

4281
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:02,210
be a physical body right and there's not
that much difference between a realistic

4282
01:34:02,210 --> 01:34:02,220
that much difference between a realistic
 

4283
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:04,100
that much difference between a realistic
simulation or your world so there has to

4284
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:04,110
simulation or your world so there has to
 

4285
01:34:04,110 --> 01:34:06,020
simulation or your world so there has to
be something you have to preserve kind

4286
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:06,030
be something you have to preserve kind
 

4287
01:34:06,030 --> 01:34:08,270
be something you have to preserve kind
of thing yes but human-like intelligence

4288
01:34:08,270 --> 01:34:08,280
of thing yes but human-like intelligence
 

4289
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:10,790
of thing yes but human-like intelligence
can only arise in the in human right

4290
01:34:10,790 --> 01:34:10,800
can only arise in the in human right
 

4291
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:14,030
can only arise in the in human right
context intelligence in other humans in

4292
01:34:14,030 --> 01:34:14,040
context intelligence in other humans in
 

4293
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:17,420
context intelligence in other humans in
order for you to demonstrate that you

4294
01:34:17,420 --> 01:34:17,430
order for you to demonstrate that you
 

4295
01:34:17,430 --> 01:34:18,980
order for you to demonstrate that you
have human-like intelligence essentially

4296
01:34:18,980 --> 01:34:18,990
have human-like intelligence essentially
 

4297
01:34:18,990 --> 01:34:25,040
have human-like intelligence essentially
yes so what kind of test and

4298
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:25,050
yes so what kind of test and
 

4299
01:34:25,050 --> 01:34:27,140
yes so what kind of test and
demonstration would be sufficient for

4300
01:34:27,140 --> 01:34:27,150
demonstration would be sufficient for
 

4301
01:34:27,150 --> 01:34:29,450
demonstration would be sufficient for
you to demonstrate human-like

4302
01:34:29,450 --> 01:34:29,460
you to demonstrate human-like
 

4303
01:34:29,460 --> 01:34:31,850
you to demonstrate human-like
intelligence yeah I just started

4304
01:34:31,850 --> 01:34:31,860
intelligence yeah I just started
 

4305
01:34:31,860 --> 01:34:34,550
intelligence yeah I just started
curiosity you you talked about in terms

4306
01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:34,560
curiosity you you talked about in terms
 

4307
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,980
curiosity you you talked about in terms
of theorem proving and program synthesis

4308
01:34:36,980 --> 01:34:36,990
of theorem proving and program synthesis
 

4309
01:34:36,990 --> 01:34:38,030
of theorem proving and program synthesis
I think you've written about that

4310
01:34:38,030 --> 01:34:38,040
I think you've written about that
 

4311
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:40,730
I think you've written about that
there's no good benchmarks for this yeah

4312
01:34:40,730 --> 01:34:40,740
there's no good benchmarks for this yeah
 

4313
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:43,060
there's no good benchmarks for this yeah
that's one of the problems so let's

4314
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:43,070
that's one of the problems so let's
 

4315
01:34:43,070 --> 01:34:46,610
that's one of the problems so let's
let's talk programs program synthesis so

4316
01:34:46,610 --> 01:34:46,620
let's talk programs program synthesis so
 

4317
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:48,970
let's talk programs program synthesis so
what do you imagine is the goods

4318
01:34:48,970 --> 01:34:48,980
what do you imagine is the goods
 

4319
01:34:48,980 --> 01:34:50,560
what do you imagine is the goods
I think it's related questions for

4320
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:50,570
I think it's related questions for
 

4321
01:34:50,570 --> 01:34:51,790
I think it's related questions for
human-like intelligence therefore

4322
01:34:51,790 --> 01:34:51,800
human-like intelligence therefore
 

4323
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:53,979
human-like intelligence therefore
program synthesis what's a good

4324
01:34:53,979 --> 01:34:53,989
program synthesis what's a good
 

4325
01:34:53,989 --> 01:34:56,770
program synthesis what's a good
benchmark for either both right so I

4326
01:34:56,770 --> 01:34:56,780
benchmark for either both right so I
 

4327
01:34:56,780 --> 01:34:58,840
benchmark for either both right so I
mean you're actually asking asking two

4328
01:34:58,840 --> 01:34:58,850
mean you're actually asking asking two
 

4329
01:34:58,850 --> 01:35:00,510
mean you're actually asking asking two
questions which is one is about

4330
01:35:00,510 --> 01:35:00,520
questions which is one is about
 

4331
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:04,020
questions which is one is about
quantifying intelligence and comparing

4332
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:04,030
quantifying intelligence and comparing
 

4333
01:35:04,030 --> 01:35:06,790
quantifying intelligence and comparing
the intelligence of an artificial system

4334
01:35:06,790 --> 01:35:06,800
the intelligence of an artificial system
 

4335
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,950
the intelligence of an artificial system
to the intelligence of a human and the

4336
01:35:08,950 --> 01:35:08,960
to the intelligence of a human and the
 

4337
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:12,100
to the intelligence of a human and the
other is about a degree to which this

4338
01:35:12,100 --> 01:35:12,110
other is about a degree to which this
 

4339
01:35:12,110 --> 01:35:14,140
other is about a degree to which this
intelligence is human right is actually

4340
01:35:14,140 --> 01:35:14,150
intelligence is human right is actually
 

4341
01:35:14,150 --> 01:35:17,380
intelligence is human right is actually
two different questions so if you look

4342
01:35:17,380 --> 01:35:17,390
two different questions so if you look
 

4343
01:35:17,390 --> 01:35:19,050
two different questions so if you look
at you mentioned earlier the Turing test

4344
01:35:19,050 --> 01:35:19,060
at you mentioned earlier the Turing test
 

4345
01:35:19,060 --> 01:35:21,340
at you mentioned earlier the Turing test
well I actually don't like the Turing

4346
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:21,350
well I actually don't like the Turing
 

4347
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:24,070
well I actually don't like the Turing
test because it's very lazy it's it's

4348
01:35:24,070 --> 01:35:24,080
test because it's very lazy it's it's
 

4349
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:26,320
test because it's very lazy it's it's
all about completely bypassing the

4350
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:26,330
all about completely bypassing the
 

4351
01:35:26,330 --> 01:35:27,700
all about completely bypassing the
problem of defining and measuring

4352
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:27,710
problem of defining and measuring
 

4353
01:35:27,710 --> 01:35:29,460
problem of defining and measuring
intelligence right and instead

4354
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:29,470
intelligence right and instead
 

4355
01:35:29,470 --> 01:35:33,250
intelligence right and instead
delegating to a human judge or panel of

4356
01:35:33,250 --> 01:35:33,260
delegating to a human judge or panel of
 

4357
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:35,770
delegating to a human judge or panel of
human judges so it's it's it's at or

4358
01:35:35,770 --> 01:35:35,780
human judges so it's it's it's at or
 

4359
01:35:35,780 --> 01:35:41,160
human judges so it's it's it's at or
cop-out right if you want to measure how

4360
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:41,170
cop-out right if you want to measure how
 

4361
01:35:41,170 --> 01:35:44,470
cop-out right if you want to measure how
human-like an agent is I think you have

4362
01:35:44,470 --> 01:35:44,480
human-like an agent is I think you have
 

4363
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:46,890
human-like an agent is I think you have
to make it interact with other humans

4364
01:35:46,890 --> 01:35:46,900
to make it interact with other humans
 

4365
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:49,240
to make it interact with other humans
maybe it's it's not necessarily good

4366
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:49,250
maybe it's it's not necessarily good
 

4367
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:52,930
maybe it's it's not necessarily good
idea to have these other humans be the

4368
01:35:52,930 --> 01:35:52,940
idea to have these other humans be the
 

4369
01:35:52,940 --> 01:35:56,320
idea to have these other humans be the
judges maybe you should just observe

4370
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:56,330
judges maybe you should just observe
 

4371
01:35:56,330 --> 01:35:58,090
judges maybe you should just observe
behavior and comparison where the human

4372
01:35:58,090 --> 01:35:58,100
behavior and comparison where the human
 

4373
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:00,790
behavior and comparison where the human
will actually have done

4374
01:36:00,790 --> 01:36:00,800
will actually have done
 

4375
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:03,339
will actually have done
when it comes to measuring how smart our

4376
01:36:03,339 --> 01:36:03,349
when it comes to measuring how smart our
 

4377
01:36:03,349 --> 01:36:03,850
when it comes to measuring how smart our
clever

4378
01:36:03,850 --> 01:36:03,860
clever
 

4379
01:36:03,860 --> 01:36:08,160
clever
an agent is and comparing that today to

4380
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:08,170
an agent is and comparing that today to
 

4381
01:36:08,170 --> 01:36:11,319
an agent is and comparing that today to
the degree of human intelligence so

4382
01:36:11,319 --> 01:36:11,329
the degree of human intelligence so
 

4383
01:36:11,329 --> 01:36:12,729
the degree of human intelligence so
we're already talking about two things

4384
01:36:12,729 --> 01:36:12,739
we're already talking about two things
 

4385
01:36:12,739 --> 01:36:15,430
we're already talking about two things
right the degree I kind of like the

4386
01:36:15,430 --> 01:36:15,440
right the degree I kind of like the
 

4387
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:17,290
right the degree I kind of like the
magnitude magnitude of an intelligence

4388
01:36:17,290 --> 01:36:17,300
magnitude magnitude of an intelligence
 

4389
01:36:17,300 --> 01:36:21,069
magnitude magnitude of an intelligence
and its direction right like the norm of

4390
01:36:21,069 --> 01:36:21,079
and its direction right like the norm of
 

4391
01:36:21,079 --> 01:36:23,410
and its direction right like the norm of
the vector right and its direction and

4392
01:36:23,410 --> 01:36:23,420
the vector right and its direction and
 

4393
01:36:23,420 --> 01:36:26,560
the vector right and its direction and
the direction is like human likeness and

4394
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:26,570
the direction is like human likeness and
 

4395
01:36:26,570 --> 01:36:32,049
the direction is like human likeness and
the magnitude the norm is intelligence

4396
01:36:32,049 --> 01:36:32,059
the magnitude the norm is intelligence
 

4397
01:36:32,059 --> 01:36:34,359
the magnitude the norm is intelligence
you could call it intelligence right so

4398
01:36:34,359 --> 01:36:34,369
you could call it intelligence right so
 

4399
01:36:34,369 --> 01:36:36,549
you could call it intelligence right so
the the direction here your sense the

4400
01:36:36,549 --> 01:36:36,559
the the direction here your sense the
 

4401
01:36:36,559 --> 01:36:39,010
the the direction here your sense the
the space of directions that are

4402
01:36:39,010 --> 01:36:39,020
the space of directions that are
 

4403
01:36:39,020 --> 01:36:40,959
the space of directions that are
human-like is very narrow

4404
01:36:40,959 --> 01:36:40,969
human-like is very narrow
 

4405
01:36:40,969 --> 01:36:45,620
human-like is very narrow
yeah so the the way you would measure

4406
01:36:45,620 --> 01:36:45,630
yeah so the the way you would measure
 

4407
01:36:45,630 --> 01:36:48,530
yeah so the the way you would measure
the magnitude of intelligence in a

4408
01:36:48,530 --> 01:36:48,540
the magnitude of intelligence in a
 

4409
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:50,390
the magnitude of intelligence in a
system in a way that that also enables

4410
01:36:50,390 --> 01:36:50,400
system in a way that that also enables
 

4411
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:54,410
system in a way that that also enables
you to compare it to that of a human

4412
01:36:54,410 --> 01:36:54,420

Duda and I I think that's that's not the
 

4427
01:37:13,409 --> 01:37:14,959
Duda and I I think that's that's not the
right way to go about it because you can

4428
01:37:14,959 --> 01:37:14,969
right way to go about it because you can
 

4429
01:37:14,969 --> 01:37:18,649
right way to go about it because you can
always be too human it at one specific

01:37:18,649 --> 01:37:18,659
always be too human it at one specific

always be too human it at one specific
task the reason why our skill at playing

4435
01:37:24,329 --> 01:37:25,939
goal or our juggling or anything is
impressive is because we are expressing

01:37:25,939 --> 01:37:25,949
impressive is because we are expressing
 

4437
01:37:25,949 --> 01:37:28,550
impressive is because we are expressing
this skill within a certain set of

this skill within a certain set of
 

4439
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:30,140
this skill within a certain set of
constraints if you remove the

01:37:30,140 --> 01:37:30,150
constraints if you remove the
 

4441
01:37:30,150 --> 01:37:32,479
constraints if you remove the
constraints the constraints that we have

achieving arbitrary levels of skill is

4456
01:37:48,950 --> 01:37:48,960
achieving arbitrary levels of skill is
 

4457
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:50,810
achieving arbitrary levels of skill is
not very interesting it and says nothing

4458
01:37:50,810 --> 01:37:50,820
not very interesting it and says nothing
 

4459
01:37:50,820 --> 01:37:53,149
not very interesting it and says nothing
about the amount of intelligence you've

4460
01:37:53,149 --> 01:37:53,159
about the amount of intelligence you've
 

4461
01:37:53,159 --> 01:37:54,950
about the amount of intelligence you've
achieved so if you want to measure

4462
01:37:54,950 --> 01:37:54,960
achieved so if you want to measure
 

4463
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:57,439
achieved so if you want to measure
intelligence you need to rigorously

4464
01:37:57,439 --> 01:37:57,449
intelligence you need to rigorously
 

4465
01:37:57,449 --> 01:38:00,319
intelligence you need to rigorously
define what intelligence is which in

4466
01:38:00,319 --> 01:38:00,329
define what intelligence is which in

4469
01:38:03,510 --> 01:38:05,569
itself units it's a very challenging
problem and do you think that's possible

4470
01:38:05,569 --> 01:38:05,579
problem and do you think that's possible
 

4471
01:38:05,579 --> 01:38:07,520
problem and do you think that's possible
if you define integers yes absolutely

4472
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:07,530
if you define integers yes absolutely
 

4473
01:38:07,530 --> 01:38:09,530
if you define integers yes absolutely
I mean you can provide many people have

4474
01:38:09,530 --> 01:38:09,540
I mean you can provide many people have
 

4475
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:12,350
I mean you can provide many people have
provided you know some definition I have

4476
01:38:12,350 --> 01:38:12,360
provided you know some definition I have
 

4477
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:13,220
provided you know some definition I have
my own definition

4478
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:13,230
my own definition
 

4479
01:38:13,230 --> 01:38:15,470
my own definition
where does your definition begin if it

4480
01:38:15,470 --> 01:38:15,480
where does your definition begin if it
 

4481
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:19,399
where does your definition begin if it
doesn't end well I think intelligence is

4482
01:38:19,399 --> 01:38:19,409
doesn't end well I think intelligence is
 

4483
01:38:19,409 --> 01:38:22,780
doesn't end well I think intelligence is
essentially the efficiency with which

4484
01:38:22,780 --> 01:38:22,790
essentially the efficiency with which
 

4485
01:38:22,790 --> 01:38:28,700
essentially the efficiency with which
you turn experience into generalizable

4486
01:38:28,700 --> 01:38:28,710
you turn experience into generalizable
 

4487
01:38:28,710 --> 01:38:31,310
you turn experience into generalizable
programs so what that means is it's the

4488
01:38:31,310 --> 01:38:31,320
programs so what that means is it's the
 

4489
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:33,830
programs so what that means is it's the
efficiency with which you turn a

4490
01:38:33,830 --> 01:38:33,840
efficiency with which you turn a
 

4491
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:40,010
efficiency with which you turn a
sampling of experience base into the

4492
01:38:40,010 --> 01:38:40,020
sampling of experience base into the
 

4493
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:45,020
sampling of experience base into the
ability to process a larger chunk of

4494
01:38:45,020 --> 01:38:45,030
ability to process a larger chunk of
 

4495
01:38:45,030 --> 01:38:45,800
ability to process a larger chunk of
experience base

4496
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:45,810
experience base
 

4497
01:38:45,810 --> 01:38:50,510
experience base
so measuring skill can be one proxy

4498
01:38:50,510 --> 01:38:50,520
so measuring skill can be one proxy
 

4499
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:53,120
so measuring skill can be one proxy
because many management tasks can be one

4500
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:53,130
because many management tasks can be one
 

4501
01:38:53,130 --> 01:38:55,939
because many management tasks can be one
proxy for measure intelligence but if

01:38:55,939 --> 01:38:55,949
proxy for measure intelligence but if
 

4503
01:38:55,949 --> 01:38:57,470

would say human intelligence is general

4582
01:40:28,900 --> 01:40:28,910
would say human intelligence is general
 

4583
01:40:28,910 --> 01:40:31,180
would say human intelligence is general
in fact it is it is quite specialized

4584
01:40:31,180 --> 01:40:31,190
in fact it is it is quite specialized
 

4585
01:40:31,190 --> 01:40:34,030
in fact it is it is quite specialized
you know the we can definitely build

01:40:34,030 --> 01:40:34,040
you know the we can definitely build
 

4587
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:36,310
you know the we can definitely build
systems that start from the same innate

systems that start from the same innate
priors that's what humans have at Birth

4590
01:40:38,590 --> 01:40:38,600
priors that's what humans have at Birth
 

4591
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:41,950
priors that's what humans have at Birth
because we already understand very well

4592
01:40:41,950 --> 01:40:41,960
because we already understand very well
 

4593
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:44,110
because we already understand very well
what sort of priors we have as humans

01:40:44,110 --> 01:40:44,120
what sort of priors we have as humans
 

4595
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:45,760
what sort of priors we have as humans
like many people have worked on this

4596
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:45,770
like many people have worked on this

01:40:57,130 --> 01:40:57,140
core knowledge and it is very much about
 

4605
01:40:57,140 --> 01:41:00,250

trying to determine and and and describe
 

4607
01:41:00,260 --> 01:41:02,590
trying to determine and and and describe
what priors we are born with like

4608
01:41:02,590 --> 01:41:02,600
what priors we are born with like
 

4609
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:04,330
what priors we are born with like
language skills and so on and all that

4610
01:41:04,330 --> 01:41:04,340
language skills and so on and all that
 

4611
01:41:04,340 --> 01:41:06,699
language skills and so on and all that
kind of stuff exactly

4612
01:41:06,699 --> 01:41:06,709
kind of stuff exactly
 

4613
01:41:06,709 --> 01:41:09,160
kind of stuff exactly
so we we have some some pretty good

4614
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:09,170
so we we have some some pretty good
 

4615
01:41:09,170 --> 01:41:10,989
so we we have some some pretty good
understanding of what price we are born

4616
01:41:10,989 --> 01:41:10,999
understanding of what price we are born
 

4617
01:41:10,999 --> 01:41:14,560
understanding of what price we are born
with so we could so I've actually been

4618
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:14,570
with so we could so I've actually been
 

4619
01:41:14,570 --> 01:41:17,169
with so we could so I've actually been
working on a benchmark for the past

4620
01:41:17,169 --> 01:41:17,179
working on a benchmark for the past
 

4621
01:41:17,179 --> 01:41:19,179
working on a benchmark for the past
couple years you know on earth I hope to

4622
01:41:19,179 --> 01:41:19,189
couple years you know on earth I hope to
 

4623
01:41:19,189 --> 01:41:22,689
couple years you know on earth I hope to
be able is it at some point is to

4624
01:41:22,689 --> 01:41:22,699
be able is it at some point is to
 

4625
01:41:22,699 --> 01:41:27,009
be able is it at some point is to
measure intelligence of systems by

4626
01:41:27,009 --> 01:41:27,019
measure intelligence of systems by
 

4627
01:41:27,019 --> 01:41:29,350
measure intelligence of systems by
culturing for priors culturing for

4628
01:41:29,350 --> 01:41:29,360
culturing for priors culturing for
 

4629
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:32,290
culturing for priors culturing for
amount of expands and by assuming the

4630
01:41:32,290 --> 01:41:32,300
amount of expands and by assuming the
 

4631
01:41:32,300 --> 01:41:34,899
amount of expands and by assuming the
same priors as with humans are born with

4632
01:41:34,899 --> 01:41:34,909
same priors as with humans are born with
 

4633
01:41:34,909 --> 01:41:37,089
same priors as with humans are born with
so that you can actually compare this

4634
01:41:37,089 --> 01:41:37,099
so that you can actually compare this
 

4635
01:41:37,099 --> 01:41:39,910
so that you can actually compare this
course to human intelligence and you can

4636
01:41:39,910 --> 01:41:39,920
course to human intelligence and you can
 

4637
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:41,799
course to human intelligence and you can
actually have humans pass the same test

4638
01:41:41,799 --> 01:41:41,809
actually have humans pass the same test
 

4639
01:41:41,809 --> 01:41:44,770
actually have humans pass the same test
in in a way that's fair yeah and so

4640
01:41:44,770 --> 01:41:44,780
in in a way that's fair yeah and so
 

4641
01:41:44,780 --> 01:41:48,429
in in a way that's fair yeah and so
importantly such a benchmark should be

4642
01:41:48,429 --> 01:41:48,439
importantly such a benchmark should be
 

4643
01:41:48,439 --> 01:41:50,860
importantly such a benchmark should be
such that

4644
01:41:50,860 --> 01:41:50,870

 

4645
01:41:50,870 --> 01:41:54,970

any amount of practicing does not

4646
01:41:54,970 --> 01:41:54,980
any amount of practicing does not
 

4647
01:41:54,980 --> 01:41:57,610
any amount of practicing does not
increase your score so try to picture a

4648
01:41:57,610 --> 01:41:57,620
increase your score so try to picture a
 

4649
01:41:57,620 --> 01:42:00,190
increase your score so try to picture a
game where no matter how much you play

4650
01:42:00,190 --> 01:42:00,200
game where no matter how much you play
 

4651
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:04,270
game where no matter how much you play
this game that does not change your

4652
01:42:04,270 --> 01:42:04,280
this game that does not change your
 

4653
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:07,530
this game that does not change your
skill at the game can you picture that

4654
01:42:07,530 --> 01:42:07,540
skill at the game can you picture that
 

4655
01:42:07,540 --> 01:42:11,050
skill at the game can you picture that
as a person who deeply appreciates

4656
01:42:11,050 --> 01:42:11,060
as a person who deeply appreciates
 

4657
01:42:11,060 --> 01:42:14,230
as a person who deeply appreciates
practice I cannot actually so it is not

4658
01:42:14,230 --> 01:42:14,240
practice I cannot actually so it is not
 

4659
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:18,490
practice I cannot actually so it is not
I can a there's actually a very simple

4660
01:42:18,490 --> 01:42:18,500
I can a there's actually a very simple
 

4661
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:21,070
I can a there's actually a very simple
trick so in order to come up with a task

4662
01:42:21,070 --> 01:42:21,080
trick so in order to come up with a task
 

4663
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:22,960
trick so in order to come up with a task
so the only thing you can measure is

4664
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:22,970
so the only thing you can measure is
 

4665
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:25,390
so the only thing you can measure is
skill at the task yes all tasks are

4666
01:42:25,390 --> 01:42:25,400
skill at the task yes all tasks are
 

4667
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:28,840
skill at the task yes all tasks are
gonna involve Pryor's here the trick is

4668
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:28,850
gonna involve Pryor's here the trick is
 

4669
01:42:28,850 --> 01:42:31,150
gonna involve Pryor's here the trick is
to know where they are and and to

4670
01:42:31,150 --> 01:42:31,160
to know where they are and and to
 

4671
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:32,920
to know where they are and and to
describe that and then you make sure

4672
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:32,930
describe that and then you make sure
 

4673
01:42:32,930 --> 01:42:34,930
describe that and then you make sure
that this is the same set of priors as

4674
01:42:34,930 --> 01:42:34,940
that this is the same set of priors as
 

4675
01:42:34,940 --> 01:42:37,000
that this is the same set of priors as
what human stuff is so you create a task

4676
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:37,010
what human stuff is so you create a task
 

4677
01:42:37,010 --> 01:42:39,640
what human stuff is so you create a task
that assumes this priors that exactly

4678
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:39,650
that assumes this priors that exactly
 

4679
01:42:39,650 --> 01:42:41,200
that assumes this priors that exactly
documents is brightest so that's the

4680
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:41,210
documents is brightest so that's the
 

4681
01:42:41,210 --> 01:42:43,240
documents is brightest so that's the
price I made explicit and I'll no other

4682
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:43,250
price I made explicit and I'll no other
 

4683
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:46,060
price I made explicit and I'll no other
priors involved and then you generate a

4684
01:42:46,060 --> 01:42:46,070
priors involved and then you generate a
 

4685
01:42:46,070 --> 01:42:49,720
priors involved and then you generate a
certain number of samples in experience

4686
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:49,730
certain number of samples in experience
 

4687
01:42:49,730 --> 01:42:53,740
certain number of samples in experience
base for this task right and this for

4688
01:42:53,740 --> 01:42:53,750
base for this task right and this for
 

4689
01:42:53,750 --> 01:42:56,200
base for this task right and this for
one task assuming that the task is new

4690
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:56,210
one task assuming that the task is new
 

4691
01:42:56,210 --> 01:43:01,330
one task assuming that the task is new
for the agent passing it that's one test

4692
01:43:01,330 --> 01:43:01,340
for the agent passing it that's one test
 

4693
01:43:01,340 --> 01:43:05,920
for the agent passing it that's one test
of this definition of intelligence and

4694
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:05,930
of this definition of intelligence and
 

4695
01:43:05,930 --> 01:43:07,960
of this definition of intelligence and
between that we set up and now you can

4696
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:07,970
between that we set up and now you can
 

4697
01:43:07,970 --> 01:43:10,270
between that we set up and now you can
scale that to management tasks that all

4698
01:43:10,270 --> 01:43:10,280
scale that to management tasks that all
 

4699
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:12,340
scale that to management tasks that all
you know each task should be new to the

4700
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:12,350
you know each task should be new to the
 

4701
01:43:12,350 --> 01:43:15,250
you know each task should be new to the
agent bassinet so the switch will be

4702
01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:15,260
agent bassinet so the switch will be
 

4703
01:43:15,260 --> 01:43:17,020
agent bassinet so the switch will be
human human interpretive ball and the

4704
01:43:17,020 --> 01:43:17,030
human human interpretive ball and the
 

4705
01:43:17,030 --> 01:43:18,730
human human interpretive ball and the
son of also lets you can actually have a

4706
01:43:18,730 --> 01:43:18,740
son of also lets you can actually have a
 

4707
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:20,260
son of also lets you can actually have a
human pass the same test and then you

4708
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:20,270
human pass the same test and then you
 

4709
01:43:20,270 --> 01:43:21,760
human pass the same test and then you
can compare the squash a machine and

4710
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:21,770
can compare the squash a machine and
 

4711
01:43:21,770 --> 01:43:23,560
can compare the squash a machine and
squash your human which could be a lot

4712
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:23,570
squash your human which could be a lot
 

4713
01:43:23,570 --> 01:43:25,510
squash your human which could be a lot
as they could even start a task a

order to to make the game fair you would
 

4735
01:43:52,210 --> 01:43:55,290
order to to make the game fair you would
have to isolate these priors and

4736
01:43:55,290 --> 01:43:55,300
have to isolate these priors and
 

4737
01:43:55,300 --> 01:43:57,660
have to isolate these priors and
describe them and then express them as

4738
01:43:57,660 --> 01:43:57,670
describe them and then express them as
 

4739
01:43:57,670 --> 01:43:59,670
describe them and then express them as
computational rules having worked a lot

exceptionally difficult process has been
 

4745
01:44:04,120 --> 01:44:05,730
exceptionally difficult process has been
a there's been a lot of good tests and

4746
01:44:05,730 --> 01:44:05,740
a there's been a lot of good tests and
 

4747
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:08,280
a there's been a lot of good tests and
basically reducing all human vision into

4748
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:08,290
basically reducing all human vision into
 

4749
01:44:08,290 --> 01:44:10,380
basically reducing all human vision into
some good priors and we're still

4750
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:10,390
some good priors and we're still
 

4751
01:44:10,390 --> 01:44:12,120
some good priors and we're still
probably far away from that perfectly

4752
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:12,130
probably far away from that perfectly
 

4753
01:44:12,130 --> 01:44:14,670
probably far away from that perfectly
but as a start for a benchmark that's an

but as a start for a benchmark that's an
 

4755
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:17,280
but as a start for a benchmark that's an
exciting possibility yeah so I said with

01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:17,290
exciting possibility yeah so I said with
 

4757
01:44:17,290 --> 01:44:21,020

we have priors about object nests like

4764
01:44:29,660 --> 01:44:29,670
we have priors about object nests like
 

4765
01:44:29,670 --> 01:44:31,850
we have priors about object nests like
about the visual space about time about

4769
01:44:35,190 --> 01:44:38,480
agents but goal-oriented behavior we
have many different priors but what's

4770
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:38,490
have many different priors but what's
 

4771
01:44:38,490 --> 01:44:41,630
have many different priors but what's
interesting is that sure we have you

4772
01:44:41,630 --> 01:44:41,640
interesting is that sure we have you
 

4773
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:43,970
interesting is that sure we have you

easy it is to encode those priors maybe
 

4799
01:45:20,449 --> 01:45:23,839
easy it is to encode those priors maybe
it requires building a universe mm-hmm

4804
01:45:28,220 --> 01:45:28,230
those priors what do you have a hope
 

4805
01:45:28,230 --> 01:45:30,680
those priors what do you have a hope
that it's can be listed like an accent I

don't think so so you have to keep in

4808
01:45:32,180 --> 01:45:32,190
don't think so so you have to keep in
 

4809
01:45:32,190 --> 01:45:34,189
don't think so so you have to keep in
mind that any knowledge about the world

4810
01:45:34,189 --> 01:45:34,199
mind that any knowledge about the world
 

4811
01:45:34,199 --> 01:45:37,030
mind that any knowledge about the world
that we are born with is something that

4812
01:45:37,030 --> 01:45:37,040
that we are born with is something that
 

4813
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:41,180
that we are born with is something that
has to have been encoded into our DNA by

4814
01:45:41,180 --> 01:45:41,190
has to have been encoded into our DNA by
 

4815
01:45:41,190 --> 01:45:43,640
has to have been encoded into our DNA by
evolution at some point right and Gina

4816
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:43,650
evolution at some point right and Gina
 

4817
01:45:43,650 --> 01:45:47,689
evolution at some point right and Gina
is a very very low bandwidth medium like

4818
01:45:47,689 --> 01:45:47,699
is a very very low bandwidth medium like
 

4819
01:45:47,699 --> 01:45:50,750
is a very very low bandwidth medium like
it's extremely long and expensive to

4820
01:45:50,750 --> 01:45:50,760
it's extremely long and expensive to
 

4821
01:45:50,760 --> 01:45:52,520
it's extremely long and expensive to
include anything into DNA because first

4822
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:52,530
include anything into DNA because first
 

4823
01:45:52,530 --> 01:45:55,100
include anything into DNA because first
of all you need some sort of

4824
01:45:55,100 --> 01:45:55,110
of all you need some sort of
 

4825
01:45:55,110 --> 01:45:57,770
of all you need some sort of
evolutionary pressure to guide this

4826
01:45:57,770 --> 01:45:57,780
evolutionary pressure to guide this
 

4827
01:45:57,780 --> 01:46:01,760
evolutionary pressure to guide this
writing process and then you know the

4828
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:01,770
writing process and then you know the
 

4829
01:46:01,770 --> 01:46:03,649
writing process and then you know the
higher level information in trying to

4830
01:46:03,649 --> 01:46:03,659
higher level information in trying to
 

4831
01:46:03,659 --> 01:46:08,770
higher level information in trying to
write the longer it's gonna take and the

4832
01:46:08,770 --> 01:46:08,780
write the longer it's gonna take and the
 

4833
01:46:08,780 --> 01:46:11,959
write the longer it's gonna take and the
thing in the environment that you are

4834
01:46:11,959 --> 01:46:11,969
thing in the environment that you are
 

4835
01:46:11,969 --> 01:46:14,209
thing in the environment that you are
trying to encode knowledge but has to be

4836
01:46:14,209 --> 01:46:14,219
trying to encode knowledge but has to be
 

4837
01:46:14,219 --> 01:46:17,270
trying to encode knowledge but has to be
stable over this this duration yes so

4838
01:46:17,270 --> 01:46:17,280
stable over this this duration yes so
 

4839
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:19,490
stable over this this duration yes so
you can only include into DNA things

4840
01:46:19,490 --> 01:46:19,500
you can only include into DNA things
 

4841
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:21,919
you can only include into DNA things
that constitute an evolutionary

4842
01:46:21,919 --> 01:46:21,929
that constitute an evolutionary
 

4843
01:46:21,929 --> 01:46:23,810
that constitute an evolutionary
advantage so this is actually a very

4844
01:46:23,810 --> 01:46:23,820
advantage so this is actually a very
 

4845
01:46:23,820 --> 01:46:26,000
advantage so this is actually a very
small subset of all possible knowledge

4846
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:26,010
small subset of all possible knowledge
 

4847
01:46:26,010 --> 01:46:27,950
small subset of all possible knowledge
about the world you can only encode

4848
01:46:27,950 --> 01:46:27,960
about the world you can only encode
 

4849
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:31,700
about the world you can only encode
things that are a stable that are true

4850
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:31,710
things that are a stable that are true
 

4851
01:46:31,710 --> 01:46:33,859
things that are a stable that are true
with a very very long period of time to

4852
01:46:33,859 --> 01:46:33,869
with a very very long period of time to
 

4853
01:46:33,869 --> 01:46:35,959
with a very very long period of time to
begin millions of years for instance we

4854
01:46:35,959 --> 01:46:35,969
begin millions of years for instance we
 

4855
01:46:35,969 --> 01:46:38,479
begin millions of years for instance we
might have some visual prior but the

4856
01:46:38,479 --> 01:46:38,489
might have some visual prior but the
 

4857
01:46:38,489 --> 01:46:42,200
might have some visual prior but the
shape of snakes right but all what makes

4858
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:42,210
shape of snakes right but all what makes
 

4859
01:46:42,210 --> 01:46:44,600
shape of snakes right but all what makes
a face what's the difference between a

4860
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:44,610
a face what's the difference between a
 

4861
01:46:44,610 --> 01:46:48,950
a face what's the difference between a
face and on face but consider this

4862
01:46:48,950 --> 01:46:48,960
face and on face but consider this
 

4863
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:51,439
face and on face but consider this
interesting question do we have any

4864
01:46:51,439 --> 01:46:51,449
interesting question do we have any
 

4865
01:46:51,449 --> 01:46:55,399
interesting question do we have any
innate sense of the visual difference

4866
01:46:55,399 --> 01:46:55,409
innate sense of the visual difference
 

4867
01:46:55,409 --> 01:46:58,040
innate sense of the visual difference
between a male face and a female face

4868
01:46:58,040 --> 01:46:58,050
between a male face and a female face
 

4869
01:46:58,050 --> 01:47:01,430
between a male face and a female face
what do you think for human I mean I

4870
01:47:01,430 --> 01:47:01,440
what do you think for human I mean I
 

4871
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:02,870
what do you think for human I mean I
would have to look back into

4872
01:47:02,870 --> 01:47:02,880
would have to look back into
 

4873
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:05,149
would have to look back into
evolutionary history when the genders

4874
01:47:05,149 --> 01:47:05,159
evolutionary history when the genders
 

4875
01:47:05,159 --> 01:47:09,049
evolutionary history when the genders
emerged but yeah most I mean the faces

4876
01:47:09,049 --> 01:47:09,059
emerged but yeah most I mean the faces
 

4877
01:47:09,059 --> 01:47:10,939
emerged but yeah most I mean the faces
of humans are quite different to my face

4878
01:47:10,939 --> 01:47:10,949
of humans are quite different to my face
 

4879
01:47:10,949 --> 01:47:15,649
of humans are quite different to my face
of great hips great apes right yeah like

4880
01:47:15,649 --> 01:47:15,659
of great hips great apes right yeah like
 

4881
01:47:15,659 --> 01:47:19,520
of great hips great apes right yeah like
you didn't say you couldn't tell the

4882
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:19,530
you didn't say you couldn't tell the
 

4883
01:47:19,530 --> 01:47:22,219
you didn't say you couldn't tell the
face of human pansy from the face of a

4884
01:47:22,219 --> 01:47:22,229
face of human pansy from the face of a
 

4885
01:47:22,229 --> 01:47:24,080
face of human pansy from the face of a
male ship and she probably yeah that'll

4886
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:24,090
male ship and she probably yeah that'll
 

4887
01:47:24,090 --> 01:47:27,919
male ship and she probably yeah that'll
hide us humans of all that so we do have

4888
01:47:27,919 --> 01:47:27,929
hide us humans of all that so we do have
 

4889
01:47:27,929 --> 01:47:30,290
hide us humans of all that so we do have
innate knowledge of what makes a face

4890
01:47:30,290 --> 01:47:30,300
innate knowledge of what makes a face
 

4891
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:33,199
innate knowledge of what makes a face
but it's actually impossible for us to

4892
01:47:33,199 --> 01:47:33,209
but it's actually impossible for us to
 

4893
01:47:33,209 --> 01:47:36,379
but it's actually impossible for us to
have any DNA encoded knowledge of the

4894
01:47:36,379 --> 01:47:36,389
have any DNA encoded knowledge of the
 

4895
01:47:36,389 --> 01:47:38,989
have any DNA encoded knowledge of the
difference between a female human face

4896
01:47:38,989 --> 01:47:38,999
difference between a female human face
 

4897
01:47:38,999 --> 01:47:41,290
difference between a female human face
and a male human face because the

4898
01:47:41,290 --> 01:47:41,300
and a male human face because the
 

4899
01:47:41,300 --> 01:47:46,310
and a male human face because the
that knowledge that information came up

4900
01:47:46,310 --> 01:47:46,320
that knowledge that information came up
 

4901
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:50,449
that knowledge that information came up
into the world actually very recently if

4902
01:47:50,449 --> 01:47:50,459
into the world actually very recently if
 

4903
01:47:50,459 --> 01:47:53,379
into the world actually very recently if
you look at the at the slowness of the

4904
01:47:53,379 --> 01:47:53,389
you look at the at the slowness of the
 

4905
01:47:53,389 --> 01:47:56,029
you look at the at the slowness of the
process of encoding knowledge into DNA

4906
01:47:56,029 --> 01:47:56,039
process of encoding knowledge into DNA
 

4907
01:47:56,039 --> 01:47:57,799
process of encoding knowledge into DNA
yeah so that's interesting that's a

4908
01:47:57,799 --> 01:47:57,809
yeah so that's interesting that's a
 

4909
01:47:57,809 --> 01:47:59,779
yeah so that's interesting that's a
really powerful argument the DNA is a

4910
01:47:59,779 --> 01:47:59,789
really powerful argument the DNA is a
 

4911
01:47:59,789 --> 01:48:01,430
really powerful argument the DNA is a
low bandwidth and it takes a long time

4912
01:48:01,430 --> 01:48:01,440
low bandwidth and it takes a long time
 

4913
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:03,979
low bandwidth and it takes a long time
to encode here that naturally creates a

4914
01:48:03,979 --> 01:48:03,989
to encode here that naturally creates a
 

4915
01:48:03,989 --> 01:48:05,810
to encode here that naturally creates a
very efficient encoding but hence the

4916
01:48:05,810 --> 01:48:05,820
very efficient encoding but hence the
 

4917
01:48:05,820 --> 01:48:08,810
very efficient encoding but hence the
yeah one one important consequence of

4918
01:48:08,810 --> 01:48:08,820
yeah one one important consequence of
 

4919
01:48:08,820 --> 01:48:11,719
yeah one one important consequence of
this is that so yes we are born into

4920
01:48:11,719 --> 01:48:11,729
this is that so yes we are born into
 

4921
01:48:11,729 --> 01:48:13,279
this is that so yes we are born into
this world with a bunch of knowledge

4922
01:48:13,279 --> 01:48:13,289
this world with a bunch of knowledge
 

4923
01:48:13,289 --> 01:48:15,500
this world with a bunch of knowledge
sometimes I high-level knowledge about

4924
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:15,510
sometimes I high-level knowledge about
 

4925
01:48:15,510 --> 01:48:17,419
sometimes I high-level knowledge about
the world like the shape the rough shape

4926
01:48:17,419 --> 01:48:17,429
the world like the shape the rough shape
 

4927
01:48:17,429 --> 01:48:19,810
the world like the shape the rough shape
of the snake of the raft shape of face

4928
01:48:19,810 --> 01:48:19,820
of the snake of the raft shape of face
 

4929
01:48:19,820 --> 01:48:22,580
of the snake of the raft shape of face
but importantly because this knowledge

4930
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:22,590
but importantly because this knowledge
 

4931
01:48:22,590 --> 01:48:26,089
but importantly because this knowledge
takes so long to write almost all of

4932
01:48:26,089 --> 01:48:26,099
takes so long to write almost all of
 

4933
01:48:26,099 --> 01:48:29,449
takes so long to write almost all of
this innate knowledge is shared with our

4934
01:48:29,449 --> 01:48:29,459
this innate knowledge is shared with our
 

4935
01:48:29,459 --> 01:48:33,500
this innate knowledge is shared with our
cousins with with great apes right so it

4936
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:33,510
cousins with with great apes right so it
 

4937
01:48:33,510 --> 01:48:34,699
cousins with with great apes right so it
is not actually this innate knowledge

4938
01:48:34,699 --> 01:48:34,709
is not actually this innate knowledge
 

4939
01:48:34,709 --> 01:48:37,939
is not actually this innate knowledge
and that makes us special but to throw

4940
01:48:37,939 --> 01:48:37,949
and that makes us special but to throw
 

4941
01:48:37,949 --> 01:48:40,459
and that makes us special but to throw
it right back at you from the earlier on

4942
01:48:40,459 --> 01:48:40,469
it right back at you from the earlier on
 

4943
01:48:40,469 --> 01:48:43,330
it right back at you from the earlier on
in our discussion it's that encoding

4944
01:48:43,330 --> 01:48:43,340
in our discussion it's that encoding
 

4945
01:48:43,340 --> 01:48:48,109
in our discussion it's that encoding
might also include the entirety of the

4946
01:48:48,109 --> 01:48:48,119
might also include the entirety of the
 

4947
01:48:48,119 --> 01:48:51,140
might also include the entirety of the
environment of Earth to some extent so

4948
01:48:51,140 --> 01:48:51,150
environment of Earth to some extent so
 

4949
01:48:51,150 --> 01:48:53,629
environment of Earth to some extent so
it can it can include things that are

4950
01:48:53,629 --> 01:48:53,639
it can it can include things that are
 

4951
01:48:53,639 --> 01:48:55,969
it can it can include things that are
important to survival and reproduction

4952
01:48:55,969 --> 01:48:55,979
important to survival and reproduction
 

4953
01:48:55,979 --> 01:48:57,500
important to survival and reproduction
so the for which there is some

4954
01:48:57,500 --> 01:48:57,510
so the for which there is some
 

4955
01:48:57,510 --> 01:48:59,600
so the for which there is some
evolutionary pressure and things that

4956
01:48:59,600 --> 01:48:59,610
evolutionary pressure and things that
 

4957
01:48:59,610 --> 01:49:02,299
evolutionary pressure and things that
are a stable constant over very very

4958
01:49:02,299 --> 01:49:02,309
are a stable constant over very very
 

4959
01:49:02,309 --> 01:49:06,020
are a stable constant over very very
very long time players and honestly it's

4960
01:49:06,020 --> 01:49:06,030
very long time players and honestly it's
 

4961
01:49:06,030 --> 01:49:07,640
very long time players and honestly it's
not that much information there's also

4962
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:07,650
not that much information there's also
 

4963
01:49:07,650 --> 01:49:12,790
not that much information there's also
beside the bandwidths constrain and

4964
01:49:12,790 --> 01:49:12,800

 

4965
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:14,709

constraints of the writing process

4966
01:49:14,709 --> 01:49:14,719
constraints of the writing process
 

4967
01:49:14,719 --> 01:49:18,720
constraints of the writing process
there's also a memory constraints like

4968
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:18,730
there's also a memory constraints like
 

4969
01:49:18,730 --> 01:49:21,610
there's also a memory constraints like
DNA the part of DNA that deals with the

4970
01:49:21,610 --> 01:49:21,620
DNA the part of DNA that deals with the
 

4971
01:49:21,620 --> 01:49:23,650
DNA the part of DNA that deals with the
human brain is actually very small it's

4972
01:49:23,650 --> 01:49:23,660
human brain is actually very small it's
 

4973
01:49:23,660 --> 01:49:25,510
human brain is actually very small it's
like you know on the order of megabytes

4974
01:49:25,510 --> 01:49:25,520
like you know on the order of megabytes
 

4975
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:28,240
like you know on the order of megabytes
right it's not that much high-level

4976
01:49:28,240 --> 01:49:28,250
right it's not that much high-level
 

4977
01:49:28,250 --> 01:49:30,900
right it's not that much high-level
knowledge about the world you can encode

4978
01:49:30,900 --> 01:49:30,910
knowledge about the world you can encode
 

4979
01:49:30,910 --> 01:49:34,330
knowledge about the world you can encode
that's quite brilliant and hopeful for

4980
01:49:34,330 --> 01:49:34,340
that's quite brilliant and hopeful for
 

4981
01:49:34,340 --> 01:49:38,590
that's quite brilliant and hopeful for
benchmark of that you're referring to of

4982
01:49:38,590 --> 01:49:38,600
benchmark of that you're referring to of
 

4983
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:40,560
benchmark of that you're referring to of
encoding priors actually look forward to

4984
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:40,570
encoding priors actually look forward to
 

4985
01:49:40,570 --> 01:49:42,910
encoding priors actually look forward to
i'm skeptical whether you can do in this

4986
01:49:42,910 --> 01:49:42,920
i'm skeptical whether you can do in this
 

4987
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:45,490
i'm skeptical whether you can do in this
couple years but hopefully i've been

4988
01:49:45,490 --> 01:49:45,500
couple years but hopefully i've been
 

4989
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:47,290
couple years but hopefully i've been
working so honestly it's a very simple

4990
01:49:47,290 --> 01:49:47,300
working so honestly it's a very simple
 

4991
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:49,150
working so honestly it's a very simple
benchmark and it's not like a big

4992
01:49:49,150 --> 01:49:49,160
benchmark and it's not like a big
 

4993
01:49:49,160 --> 01:49:50,709
benchmark and it's not like a big
breakfast or anything it's more like a

4994
01:49:50,709 --> 01:49:50,719
breakfast or anything it's more like a
 

4995
01:49:50,719 --> 01:49:54,490
breakfast or anything it's more like a
fun a fun side project right these fun

4996
01:49:54,490 --> 01:49:54,500
fun a fun side project right these fun
 

4997
01:49:54,500 --> 01:49:57,790
fun a fun side project right these fun
so is imagenet these fun side projects

4998
01:49:57,790 --> 01:49:57,800
so is imagenet these fun side projects
 

4999
01:49:57,800 --> 01:50:01,240
so is imagenet these fun side projects
could launch entire groups of efforts

5000
01:50:01,240 --> 01:50:01,250
could launch entire groups of efforts
 

5001
01:50:01,250 --> 01:50:04,209
could launch entire groups of efforts
towards uh towards creating reasoning

5002
01:50:04,209 --> 01:50:04,219
towards uh towards creating reasoning
 

5003
01:50:04,219 --> 01:50:05,709
towards uh towards creating reasoning
systems and so on and i think yeah

5004
01:50:05,709 --> 01:50:05,719
systems and so on and i think yeah
 

5005
01:50:05,719 --> 01:50:07,410
systems and so on and i think yeah
that's Nicole it's trying to measure a

5006
01:50:07,410 --> 01:50:07,420
that's Nicole it's trying to measure a
 

5007
01:50:07,420 --> 01:50:09,700
that's Nicole it's trying to measure a
strong generalization to measure the

5008
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:09,710
strong generalization to measure the
 

5009
01:50:09,710 --> 01:50:12,070
strong generalization to measure the
strength of abstraction

5010
01:50:12,070 --> 01:50:12,080
strength of abstraction
 

5011
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:13,630
strength of abstraction
you know minds right now mind something

5012
01:50:13,630 --> 01:50:13,640
you know minds right now mind something
 

5013
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:17,290
you know minds right now mind something
in a in a fishery contagion and if

5014
01:50:17,290 --> 01:50:17,300
in a in a fishery contagion and if
 

5015
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:18,459
in a in a fishery contagion and if
there's anything through about this

5016
01:50:18,459 --> 01:50:18,469
there's anything through about this
 

5017
01:50:18,469 --> 01:50:23,590
there's anything through about this
science organism is its individual cells

5018
01:50:23,590 --> 01:50:23,600
science organism is its individual cells
 

5019
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:24,700
science organism is its individual cells
love competition

5020
01:50:24,700 --> 01:50:24,710
love competition
 

5021
01:50:24,710 --> 01:50:26,530
love competition
so in benchmarks encourage competition

5022
01:50:26,530 --> 01:50:26,540
so in benchmarks encourage competition
 

5023
01:50:26,540 --> 01:50:28,750
so in benchmarks encourage competition
so that's uh yeah that's an exciting

5024
01:50:28,750 --> 01:50:28,760
so that's uh yeah that's an exciting
 

5025
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:31,300
so that's uh yeah that's an exciting
possibility if you are do you think an

5026
01:50:31,300 --> 01:50:31,310
possibility if you are do you think an
 

5027
01:50:31,310 --> 01:50:34,090
possibility if you are do you think an
AI winter is coming and how do we

5028
01:50:34,090 --> 01:50:34,100
AI winter is coming and how do we
 

5029
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:37,479
AI winter is coming and how do we
prevent it not really so an AI winter is

5030
01:50:37,479 --> 01:50:37,489
prevent it not really so an AI winter is
 

5031
01:50:37,489 --> 01:50:40,060
prevent it not really so an AI winter is
something that would occur when there's

5032
01:50:40,060 --> 01:50:40,070
something that would occur when there's
 

5033
01:50:40,070 --> 01:50:42,310
something that would occur when there's
a big mismatch between how we are

5034
01:50:42,310 --> 01:50:42,320
a big mismatch between how we are
 

5035
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:45,400
a big mismatch between how we are
selling the capabilities of VI and and

5036
01:50:45,400 --> 01:50:45,410
selling the capabilities of VI and and
 

5037
01:50:45,410 --> 01:50:47,190
selling the capabilities of VI and and
the actual capabilities of VI and

5038
01:50:47,190 --> 01:50:47,200

the the concern is you actually tweet
 

5141
01:53:02,370 --> 01:53:03,800
the the concern is you actually tweet
about the skooled autonomous vehicles

about the skooled autonomous vehicles
 

5143
01:53:03,810 --> 01:53:05,750
about the skooled autonomous vehicles
right there's a almost every single

twenty one twenty two this is a good
 

5151
01:53:12,300 --> 01:53:15,250
twenty one twenty two this is a good
example of that the consequences of

01:53:23,190 --> 01:53:26,660
especially a lot recently in this area I
have a deep concern of what happens when

5160
01:53:26,660 --> 01:53:26,670
have a deep concern of what happens when
 

5161
01:53:26,670 --> 01:53:28,430
have a deep concern of what happens when
all these companies after I've invested

5162
01:53:28,430 --> 01:53:28,440
all these companies after I've invested
 

5163
01:53:28,440 --> 01:53:31,280
all these companies after I've invested
billions have a meeting and say how much

5164

billions have a meeting and say how much
 

5165
01:53:31,290 --> 01:53:32,720
billions have a meeting and say how much
do we actually first of all do we have

5166
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:32,730
do we actually first of all do we have
 

5167
01:53:32,730 --> 01:53:34,490
do we actually first of all do we have
an autonomous vehicles the answer it

5168
01:53:34,490 --> 01:53:34,500
an autonomous vehicles the answer it
 

5169
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:37,100
an autonomous vehicles the answer it
will definitely be no and second will be

5170
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:37,110
will definitely be no and second will be
 

5171
01:53:37,110 --> 01:53:39,320
will definitely be no and second will be
wait a minute we've invested one two

5172
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:39,330
wait a minute we've invested one two
 

5173
01:53:39,330 --> 01:53:39,830
wait a minute we've invested one two
three

5174

three
 

5175
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:41,689
three
for a billion dollars into this and we

5176
01:53:41,689 --> 01:53:41,699
for a billion dollars into this and we
 

5177
01:53:41,699 --> 01:53:44,890
for a billion dollars into this and we
made no profit and the reaction to that

5178
01:53:44,890 --> 01:53:44,900
made no profit and the reaction to that
 

5179
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:47,629
made no profit and the reaction to that
may be going very hard in another

5180
01:53:47,629 --> 01:53:47,639
may be going very hard in another
 

5181
01:53:47,639 --> 01:53:49,820
may be going very hard in another
directions that might impact either even

5182
01:53:49,820 --> 01:53:49,830
directions that might impact either even
 

5183
01:53:49,830 --> 01:53:51,500
directions that might impact either even
other industries and that's what we call

5184
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:51,510
other industries and that's what we call
 

5185
01:53:51,510 --> 01:53:52,910
other industries and that's what we call
in the air winter is when there is

5186
01:53:52,910 --> 01:53:52,920
in the air winter is when there is
 

5187
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:55,790
in the air winter is when there is
backlash well no one believes any of

5188
01:53:55,790 --> 01:53:55,800
backlash well no one believes any of
 

5189
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:57,350
backlash well no one believes any of
these promises anymore because they've

5190
01:53:57,350 --> 01:53:57,360
these promises anymore because they've
 

5191
01:53:57,360 --> 01:53:59,390
these promises anymore because they've
turned that be big lies the first time

5192
01:53:59,390 --> 01:53:59,400
turned that be big lies the first time
 

5193
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:01,669
turned that be big lies the first time
around yeah and this will definitely

5194
01:54:01,669 --> 01:54:01,679
around yeah and this will definitely
 

5195
01:54:01,679 --> 01:54:03,680
around yeah and this will definitely
happen to some extent for autonomous

don't believe we are going to have a

right but there is also too much hype so

5222
01:54:40,189 --> 01:54:40,199
right but there is also too much hype so
 

5223
01:54:40,199 --> 01:54:42,140
right but there is also too much hype so
there will be some backlash especially

there will be some backlash especially
 

5225
01:54:42,150 --> 01:54:45,740
there will be some backlash especially
there will be backlash so you know some

AGI alright and and the fact that Asia

01:54:52,370 --> 01:54:52,380
AGI alright and and the fact that Asia
 

5231
01:54:52,380 --> 01:54:54,020
AGI alright and and the fact that Asia
is going to create infinite value like

if you can develop an AI system that

5236
01:54:59,209 --> 01:54:59,219
if you can develop an AI system that
 

5237
01:54:59,219 --> 01:55:02,270
if you can develop an AI system that
passes a certain threshold they of IQ or

5238
01:55:02,270 --> 01:55:02,280
passes a certain threshold they of IQ or
 

5239
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:03,800
passes a certain threshold they of IQ or
something then suddenly you have

5240
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:03,810
something then suddenly you have
 

5241
01:55:03,810 --> 01:55:07,640
something then suddenly you have
infinite value yes and well there are

after all I don't know about you but
 

5259
01:55:29,090 --> 01:55:32,120
after all I don't know about you but
because I've spoken about AGI sometimes

5260
01:55:32,120 --> 01:55:32,130
because I've spoken about AGI sometimes
 

5261
01:55:32,130 --> 01:55:34,580

emails from people giving me they're
 

5265
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:39,320
emails from people giving me they're
usually like a large manifestos

usually like a large manifestos
 

5267
01:55:39,330 --> 01:55:44,290
usually like a large manifestos
of they've they say to me that they have

of they've they say to me that they have
 

5269
01:55:44,300 --> 01:55:46,790
of they've they say to me that they have
created an AGI system or they know how

5270
01:55:46,790 --> 01:55:46,800
created an AGI system or they know how
 

5271
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:48,470
created an AGI system or they know how
to do it and there's the long write-up

5272
01:55:48,470 --> 01:55:48,480
to do it and there's the long write-up
 

5273
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:50,100
to do it and there's the long write-up
of how to doing it so that was easy man

5274
01:55:50,100 --> 01:55:50,110
of how to doing it so that was easy man
 

5275
01:55:50,110 --> 01:55:53,100
of how to doing it so that was easy man
they are there little bit feel like it's

01:55:53,100 --> 01:55:53,110
they are there little bit feel like it's
 

5277
01:55:53,110 --> 01:55:56,360
they are there little bit feel like it's
generated by an AI system actually but

it's you have a transformer generating
crank papers about this yeah so what the

01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:07,510
crank papers about this yeah so what the
 

5287
01:56:07,510 --> 01:56:09,090
crank papers about this yeah so what the
question is about because you've been

how do I so when you start to talk about

5296
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:20,530
how do I so when you start to talk about
 

5297
01:56:20,530 --> 01:56:23,850
how do I so when you start to talk about
a GI or anything like the reasoning

a GI or anything like the reasoning

benchmarks and so on so something that

5300
01:56:26,130 --> 01:56:26,140
benchmarks and so on so something that
 

5301
01:56:26,140 --> 01:56:27,510
benchmarks and so on so something that
doesn't have a benchmark it's really

doesn't have a benchmark it's really
 

5303
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:30,660
doesn't have a benchmark it's really
difficult to know I mean I talked to

5304
01:56:30,660 --> 01:56:30,670
difficult to know I mean I talked to
 

5305
01:56:30,670 --> 01:56:32,520
difficult to know I mean I talked to
Jeff Hawkins who's really looking at

01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:32,530
Jeff Hawkins who's really looking at
 

5307
01:56:32,530 --> 01:56:35,070
Jeff Hawkins who's really looking at
neuroscience approaches to hug and

5308
01:56:35,070 --> 01:56:35,080
neuroscience approaches to hug and
 

5309
01:56:35,080 --> 01:56:39,150
neuroscience approaches to hug and
there's some there's echoes of really

01:56:39,150 --> 01:56:39,160
there's some there's echoes of really
 

5311
01:56:39,160 --> 01:56:41,430
there's some there's echoes of really
interesting ideas in at least just case

5312
01:56:41,430 --> 01:56:41,440
interesting ideas in at least just case
 

5313
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:44,130
interesting ideas in at least just case
which is Charlie how do you usually

5314
01:56:44,130 --> 01:56:44,140
which is Charlie how do you usually
 

5315
01:56:44,140 --> 01:56:47,640
which is Charlie how do you usually
think about this they like preventing

5316
01:56:47,640 --> 01:56:47,650
think about this they like preventing
 

5317
01:56:47,650 --> 01:56:49,170
think about this they like preventing
yourself from being too narrow-minded

5318
01:56:49,170 --> 01:56:49,180
yourself from being too narrow-minded
 

5319
01:56:49,180 --> 01:56:52,020
yourself from being too narrow-minded
and elitist about you know deep learning

5320
01:56:52,020 --> 01:56:52,030
and elitist about you know deep learning
 

5321
01:56:52,030 --> 01:56:54,690
and elitist about you know deep learning
it has to work on these particular

5322
01:56:54,690 --> 01:56:54,700
it has to work on these particular
 

5323
01:56:54,700 --> 01:56:57,690
it has to work on these particular
benchmarks otherwise it's trash well you

5324
01:56:57,690 --> 01:56:57,700
benchmarks otherwise it's trash well you
 

5325
01:56:57,700 --> 01:57:03,060
benchmarks otherwise it's trash well you
know the thing is intelligence does not

5326
01:57:03,060 --> 01:57:03,070
know the thing is intelligence does not
 

5327
01:57:03,070 --> 01:57:06,270
know the thing is intelligence does not
exist in the abstract intelligences to

5328
01:57:06,270 --> 01:57:06,280
exist in the abstract intelligences to
 

5329
01:57:06,280 --> 01:57:08,040
exist in the abstract intelligences to
be applied so if you don't have a

5330
01:57:08,040 --> 01:57:08,050
be applied so if you don't have a
 

5331
01:57:08,050 --> 01:57:09,930
be applied so if you don't have a
benchmark if you're an improvement and

5332
01:57:09,930 --> 01:57:09,940
benchmark if you're an improvement and
 

5333
01:57:09,940 --> 01:57:11,430
benchmark if you're an improvement and
some benchmark maybe it's a new

5334
01:57:11,430 --> 01:57:11,440
some benchmark maybe it's a new
 

5335
01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:12,990
some benchmark maybe it's a new
benchmark all right maybe it's not

5336
01:57:12,990 --> 01:57:13,000
benchmark all right maybe it's not
 

5337
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,940
benchmark all right maybe it's not
something I've been you again before but

5338
01:57:14,940 --> 01:57:14,950
something I've been you again before but
 

5339
01:57:14,950 --> 01:57:17,010
something I've been you again before but
you juni is a problem that you're trying

5340
01:57:17,010 --> 01:57:17,020
you juni is a problem that you're trying
 

5341
01:57:17,020 --> 01:57:18,660
you juni is a problem that you're trying
so you're not gonna come up with a

5342
01:57:18,660 --> 01:57:18,670
so you're not gonna come up with a
 

5343
01:57:18,670 --> 01:57:20,130
so you're not gonna come up with a
solution with that a problem

5344
01:57:20,130 --> 01:57:20,140
solution with that a problem
 

5345
01:57:20,140 --> 01:57:23,850
solution with that a problem
so you general intelligence I mean

5346
01:57:23,850 --> 01:57:23,860
so you general intelligence I mean
 

5347
01:57:23,860 --> 01:57:24,690
so you general intelligence I mean
you've clearly highlight a

5348
01:57:24,690 --> 01:57:24,700
you've clearly highlight a
 

5349
01:57:24,700 --> 01:57:27,660
you've clearly highlight a
generalization if you want to claim that

5350
01:57:27,660 --> 01:57:27,670
generalization if you want to claim that
 

5351
01:57:27,670 --> 01:57:30,510
generalization if you want to claim that
you have an intelligent system it should

5352
01:57:30,510 --> 01:57:30,520
you have an intelligent system it should
 

5353
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:32,340
you have an intelligent system it should
come with the benchmark issued yes it

5354
01:57:32,340 --> 01:57:32,350
come with the benchmark issued yes it
 

5355
01:57:32,350 --> 01:57:35,640
come with the benchmark issued yes it
should display capabilities of some kind

5356
01:57:35,640 --> 01:57:35,650
should display capabilities of some kind
 

5357
01:57:35,650 --> 01:57:38,400
should display capabilities of some kind
it should it should show that it can

5358
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:38,410
it should it should show that it can
 

5359
01:57:38,410 --> 01:57:40,920
it should it should show that it can
create some form of value even if it's a

5360
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:40,930
create some form of value even if it's a
 

5361
01:57:40,930 --> 01:57:43,710
create some form of value even if it's a
very artificial form of value and that's

5362
01:57:43,710 --> 01:57:43,720
very artificial form of value and that's
 

5363
01:57:43,720 --> 01:57:45,150
very artificial form of value and that's
also the reason why you don't actually

5364
01:57:45,150 --> 01:57:45,160
also the reason why you don't actually
 

5365
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:48,510
also the reason why you don't actually
need to care about turning which papers

5366
01:57:48,510 --> 01:57:48,520
need to care about turning which papers
 

5367
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:50,750
need to care about turning which papers
actually submit in potential and which

5368
01:57:50,750 --> 01:57:50,760
actually submit in potential and which
 

5369
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:52,550
actually submit in potential and which
do not

5370
01:57:52,550 --> 01:57:52,560
do not
 

5371
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:55,410
do not
because if

5372
01:57:55,410 --> 01:57:55,420
because if
 

5373
01:57:55,420 --> 01:57:56,760
because if
if there is a new technique it's

5374
01:57:56,760 --> 01:57:56,770
if there is a new technique it's
 

5375
01:57:56,770 --> 01:57:59,100
if there is a new technique it's
actually creating value you know this is

5376
01:57:59,100 --> 01:57:59,110
actually creating value you know this is
 

5377
01:57:59,110 --> 01:58:00,300
actually creating value you know this is
going to be brought to light very

5378
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:00,310
going to be brought to light very
 

5379
01:58:00,310 --> 01:58:01,740
going to be brought to light very
quickly because it's actually making a

5380
01:58:01,740 --> 01:58:01,750
quickly because it's actually making a
 

5381
01:58:01,750 --> 01:58:03,660
quickly because it's actually making a
difference so it's the difference

5382
01:58:03,660 --> 01:58:03,670
difference so it's the difference
 

5383
01:58:03,670 --> 01:58:05,160
difference so it's the difference
between something that's ineffective and

5384
01:58:05,160 --> 01:58:05,170
between something that's ineffective and
 

5385
01:58:05,170 --> 01:58:08,790
between something that's ineffective and
something that is actually useful and

5386
01:58:08,790 --> 01:58:08,800
something that is actually useful and
 

5387
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:12,090
something that is actually useful and
ultimately usefulness is our guide not

5388
01:58:12,090 --> 01:58:12,100
ultimately usefulness is our guide not
 

5389
01:58:12,100 --> 01:58:13,710
ultimately usefulness is our guide not
just in this field but if you look at

5390
01:58:13,710 --> 01:58:13,720
just in this field but if you look at
 

5391
01:58:13,720 --> 01:58:15,870
just in this field but if you look at
science in general maybe there are many

5392
01:58:15,870 --> 01:58:15,880
science in general maybe there are many
 

5393
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:17,370
science in general maybe there are many
many people over the years that have had

5394
01:58:17,370 --> 01:58:17,380
many people over the years that have had
 

5395
01:58:17,380 --> 01:58:20,130
many people over the years that have had
some really interesting theories of

5396
01:58:20,130 --> 01:58:20,140
some really interesting theories of
 

5397
01:58:20,140 --> 01:58:22,140
some really interesting theories of
everything but they were just completely

5398
01:58:22,140 --> 01:58:22,150
everything but they were just completely
 

5399
01:58:22,150 --> 01:58:24,630
everything but they were just completely
useless and you don't actually need to

5400
01:58:24,630 --> 01:58:24,640
useless and you don't actually need to
 

5401
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:26,670
useless and you don't actually need to
tell the interesting theories from the

5402
01:58:26,670 --> 01:58:26,680
tell the interesting theories from the
 

5403
01:58:26,680 --> 01:58:29,760
tell the interesting theories from the
user series all you need is to see you

5404
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:29,770
user series all you need is to see you
 

5405
01:58:29,770 --> 01:58:33,090
user series all you need is to see you
know is this actually having an effect

you know is this actually useful it is

cranks stuck with it right yeah and so

5444
01:59:13,740 --> 01:59:13,750
cranks stuck with it right yeah and so
 

5445
01:59:13,750 --> 01:59:16,320
cranks stuck with it right yeah and so
us individual agents even if everyone's

5446
01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:16,330
us individual agents even if everyone's
 

5447
01:59:16,330 --> 01:59:17,810
us individual agents even if everyone's
laughing at us just stick with it

5448
01:59:17,810 --> 01:59:17,820
laughing at us just stick with it
 

5449
01:59:17,820 --> 01:59:19,740
laughing at us just stick with it
because if you believe you have

5450
01:59:19,740 --> 01:59:19,750
because if you believe you have
 

5451
01:59:19,750 --> 01:59:21,150
because if you believe you have
something you should stick with it and

5452
01:59:21,150 --> 01:59:21,160
something you should stick with it and
 

5453
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:24,510
something you should stick with it and
see it's true that's a beautiful
