the way a lot of scientists work is
almost as the sum of eureka moments

170
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,280
almost as the sum of eureka moments
 

171
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,110
almost as the sum of eureka moments
where all of a sudden they sit down and

172
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,120
where all of a sudden they sit down and
 

173
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,270
where all of a sudden they sit down and
start writing two papers in a row and

174
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:13,280
start writing two papers in a row and
 

175
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,830
start writing two papers in a row and
the papers are usually isolated and when

176
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:15,840
the papers are usually isolated and when
 

177
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,750
the papers are usually isolated and when
you actually look at it it's the papers

178
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:17,760
you actually look at it it's the papers
 

179
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,910
you actually look at it it's the papers
are you know chapters of a way more

180
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:19,920
are you know chapters of a way more
 

181
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,390
are you know chapters of a way more
complex uh story

182
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,400
complex uh story
 

183
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,949
complex uh story
and the definement qed paper is a good

184
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:24,959
and the definement qed paper is a good
 

185
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,789
and the definement qed paper is a good
example so feynman was actually going

186
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:26,799
example so feynman was actually going
 

187
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,270
example so feynman was actually going
through a pretty dark phase before

188
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,280
through a pretty dark phase before
 

189
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,670
through a pretty dark phase before
writing that paper it was he lost

190
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:31,680
writing that paper it was he lost
 

191
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,830
writing that paper it was he lost
enthusiasm with physics and doing

192
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
enthusiasm with physics and doing
 

193
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,149
enthusiasm with physics and doing
physics problems and there was one time

194
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:36,159
physics problems and there was one time
 

195
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,869
physics problems and there was one time
when he was in the cafeteria of cornell

196
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:38,879
when he was in the cafeteria of cornell
 

197
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,869
when he was in the cafeteria of cornell
and he saw a guy that was throwing

198
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
and he saw a guy that was throwing
 

199
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,949
and he saw a guy that was throwing
flights in the air and he noticed that

200
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:42,959
flights in the air and he noticed that
 

201
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,630
flights in the air and he noticed that
there was when the plate was in the air

202
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:44,640
there was when the plate was in the air
 

203
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,710
there was when the plate was in the air
there were two movements there the plate

204
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:46,720
there were two movements there the plate
 

205
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,789
there were two movements there the plate
was wobbling but he also noticed that

206
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:48,799
was wobbling but he also noticed that
 

207
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,750
was wobbling but he also noticed that
the the cornell symbol was rotating and

208
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
the the cornell symbol was rotating and
 

209
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,350
the the cornell symbol was rotating and
he was able to figure out the equations

210
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:53,360
he was able to figure out the equations
 

211
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,589
he was able to figure out the equations
of motions uh the equations of motions

212
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:55,599
of motions uh the equations of motions
 

213
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,589
of motions uh the equations of motions
of those uh plates and that uh led him

214
00:03:59,589 --> 00:03:59,599
of those uh plates and that uh led him
 

215
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,710
of those uh plates and that uh led him
to kind of think a little bit about

216
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:02,720
to kind of think a little bit about
 

217
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,350
to kind of think a little bit about
electron orbits in relativity which led

218
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,360
electron orbits in relativity which led
 

219
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,149
electron orbits in relativity which led
to the paper of

220
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:08,159
to the paper of
 

221
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,070
to the paper of
about quantum electrodynamics so that

222
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,080
about quantum electrodynamics so that
 

223
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,990
about quantum electrodynamics so that
kind of reignited

224
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,000
kind of reignited
 

225
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,030
kind of reignited
his interest in physics and and and

226
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,040
his interest in physics and and and
 

227
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,110
his interest in physics and and and
ended up publishing the paper that led

228
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,120
ended up publishing the paper that led
 

229
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,390
ended up publishing the paper that led
to the his nobel prize basically and i

230
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,400
to the his nobel prize basically and i
 

231
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,909
to the his nobel prize basically and i
think it's it's

232
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
think it's it's
 

233
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,350
think it's it's
there are a lot of really interesting

234
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,360
there are a lot of really interesting
 

235
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,430
there are a lot of really interesting
backstories about papers that readers

236
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:25,440
backstories about papers that readers
 

237
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,350
backstories about papers that readers
never get to know friends we did a

238
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:27,360
never get to know friends we did a
 

239
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,830
never get to know friends we did a
couple of months ago um

240
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:29,840
couple of months ago um
 

241
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,990
couple of months ago um
an ama around a paper a pretty famous

242
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,000
an ama around a paper a pretty famous
 

243

paper the gans paper with ian goodfellow

244
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,880
paper the gans paper with ian goodfellow
 

245
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,270
paper the gans paper with ian goodfellow
and so we did an ama where everyone was

246
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:39,280
and so we did an ama where everyone was
 

247
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,030
and so we did an ama where everyone was
could ask questions about the paper and

248
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,040
could ask questions about the paper and
 

249
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,030
could ask questions about the paper and
ian was responding to those questions

250
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,040
ian was responding to those questions
 

251
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,909
ian was responding to those questions
you also he was also telling the story

252
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:45,919
you also he was also telling the story
 

253
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,830
you also he was also telling the story
of how he got the idea for that paper in

254
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:47,840
of how he got the idea for that paper in
 

255
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,909
of how he got the idea for that paper in
a bar so there was also an interesting

256
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919
a bar so there was also an interesting
 

257
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,710
a bar so there was also an interesting
and a back story i also read a book by

258
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:54,720
and a back story i also read a book by
 

259

a phd student to the fields metal and he
 

271
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,870
a phd student to the fields metal and he
tries to be as descriptive as possible

tries to be as descriptive as possible
 

273
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,790
tries to be as descriptive as possible
every single step how we got to the

274
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:10,800
every single step how we got to the
 

275
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,189
every single step how we got to the
fields metal and it's interesting also

276
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:13,199
fields metal and it's interesting also
 

277
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,870
fields metal and it's interesting also
to see just the amount of random

278
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:14,880
to see just the amount of random
 

279

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,029
researchers sometimes over coffee and
how it led to like

284
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
how it led to like
 

285
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,790
how it led to like
fundamental breakthroughs and some of

286
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:22,800
fundamental breakthroughs and some of
 

287
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,629
fundamental breakthroughs and some of
his most important papers so i think

288
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:24,639
his most important papers so i think
 

289
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,749
his most important papers so i think
it's super interesting to have that

290
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:25,759
it's super interesting to have that
 

291
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,390
it's super interesting to have that
context of of the backstory well the ian

292
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
context of of the backstory well the ian
 

293
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,990
context of of the backstory well the ian
goodfellow story is kind of interesting

294
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
goodfellow story is kind of interesting
 

295
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,749
goodfellow story is kind of interesting
and perhaps that's true for feynman as

296
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:31,759
and perhaps that's true for feynman as
 

297
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,430
and perhaps that's true for feynman as
well i don't know if it's romanticizing

298
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
well i don't know if it's romanticizing
 

299
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,710
well i don't know if it's romanticizing
the thing but

300
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:34,720
the thing but
 

301
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,469
the thing but
it seems like just

302
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:36,479
it seems like just
 

303
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,469
it seems like just
a few little insights and a little bit

304
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:38,479
a few little insights and a little bit
 

305
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,430
a few little insights and a little bit
of work

306
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
of work
 

307
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,230
of work
does most of the leap required

308
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,240
does most of the leap required
 

309
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,590
does most of the leap required
do you have a sense that for a lot of

310
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:43,600
do you have a sense that for a lot of
 

311
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,350
do you have a sense that for a lot of
the stuff you've looked at

312
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
the stuff you've looked at
 

313
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,590
the stuff you've looked at
just looking back through history

314
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:47,600
just looking back through history
 

315
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,590
just looking back through history
uh it it wasn't necessarily the grind

316
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
uh it it wasn't necessarily the grind
 

317
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,430
uh it it wasn't necessarily the grind
of like andrew wiles of the females last

318
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:53,440
of like andrew wiles of the females last
 

319
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,029
of like andrew wiles of the females last
theorem for example

320

it was more like a a brilliant moment of

322
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600
it was more like a a brilliant moment of
 

323
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,070
it was more like a a brilliant moment of
insight in fact ian goodfellow has a

324
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,080
insight in fact ian goodfellow has a
 

325
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,189
insight in fact ian goodfellow has a
kind of sadness to him almost in that

326
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:03,199
kind of sadness to him almost in that
 

327
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,150
kind of sadness to him almost in that
at that time in machine learning like at

328
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,160
at that time in machine learning like at
 

329
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,150
at that time in machine learning like at
that time especially in uh

330
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
that time especially in uh
 

331
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,990
that time especially in uh
for gans

332
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,000
for gans
 

333
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,029
for gans
you could

334
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:11,039
you could
 

335
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,550
you could
code something up really quickly on a

336
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:12,560
code something up really quickly on a
 

337
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,830
code something up really quickly on a
single machine

338
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:13,840
single machine
 

339
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,510
single machine
and almost do the invention go from idea

340
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,520
and almost do the invention go from idea
 

341
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,909
and almost do the invention go from idea
to uh experimental validation and like a

342
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:19,919
to uh experimental validation and like a
 

343
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,550
to uh experimental validation and like a
single night a single person could do it

344
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:22,560
single night a single person could do it
 

345
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,230
single night a single person could do it
and now there's kind of a sadness that a

346
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
and now there's kind of a sadness that a
 

347
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,830
and now there's kind of a sadness that a
lot of the breakthroughs you might have

348
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:25,840
lot of the breakthroughs you might have
 

349
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,670
lot of the breakthroughs you might have
in machine learning kind of require

350
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:27,680
in machine learning kind of require
 

351
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,510
in machine learning kind of require
large-scale experiments

352
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:29,520
large-scale experiments
 

353
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,790
large-scale experiments
so it was almost like the early days

354
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:32,800
so it was almost like the early days
 

355
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,350
so it was almost like the early days
so i wonder how many

356
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:35,360
so i wonder how many
 

357
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,830
so i wonder how many
low-hanging fruit there are in science

358
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:37,840
low-hanging fruit there are in science
 

359
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,350
low-hanging fruit there are in science
and mathematics

360
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
and mathematics
 

361
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,150
and mathematics
and even engineering where it's like

362
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,160
and even engineering where it's like
 

363
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,990
and even engineering where it's like
you could do that little experiment

364
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,000
you could do that little experiment
 

365
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,430
you could do that little experiment
quickly like you have an insight and a

366
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,440
quickly like you have an insight and a
 

367
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,590
quickly like you have an insight and a
bar why is it always a bar but you have

368
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:47,600
bar why is it always a bar but you have
 

369
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,909
bar why is it always a bar but you have
an insight at a bar and then just

370
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:49,919
an insight at a bar and then just
 

371
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,029
an insight at a bar and then just
implement

372
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:51,039
implement
 

373
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,430
implement
and the world changes

374
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:53,440
and the world changes
 

375
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,029
and the world changes
it's it's a good point i think it also

376
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:55,039
it's it's a good point i think it also
 

377
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,950
it's it's a good point i think it also
depends a lot on the maturity of the

378
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960
depends a lot on the maturity of the
 

379
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,270
depends a lot on the maturity of the
field when you look at a field like

380
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,280
field when you look at a field like
 

381
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,909
field when you look at a field like
mathematics like it's a pretty mature

382
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:01,919
mathematics like it's a pretty mature
 

383
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,550
mathematics like it's a pretty mature
field uh feels like machine learning um

384
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:04,560
field uh feels like machine learning um
 

385
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,950
field uh feels like machine learning um
it's it's growing pretty fast

386
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
it's it's growing pretty fast
 

387
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,589
it's it's growing pretty fast
and um it's actually pretty pretty

388
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
and um it's actually pretty pretty
 

389
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,350
and um it's actually pretty pretty
interesting i i looked up like the

390
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:11,360
interesting i i looked up like the
 

391
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,469
interesting i i looked up like the
number of

392
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:12,479
number of
 

393
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,629
number of
new papers

394
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:14,639
new papers
 

395
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,469
new papers
on archive with the keyword machine

396
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:16,479
on archive with the keyword machine
 

397
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,110
on archive with the keyword machine
learning and like 50 of those papers

398
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,120
learning and like 50 of those papers
 

399
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,270
learning and like 50 of those papers
have been published on in the last 12

400
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:21,280
have been published on in the last 12
 

401
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,150
have been published on in the last 12
months so you can see just the same zero

402
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:24,160
months so you can see just the same zero
 

403
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,309
months so you can see just the same zero
five zero fifty percent so you can see

404
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:26,319
five zero fifty percent so you can see
 

405
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,270
five zero fifty percent so you can see
the the the the magnitude of growth in

406
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,280
the the the the magnitude of growth in
 

407
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,070
the the the the magnitude of growth in
that field and so i think like as fields

408
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,080
that field and so i think like as fields
 

409
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,710
that field and so i think like as fields
mature like those types of moments i

410
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:34,720
mature like those types of moments i
 

411
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,070
mature like those types of moments i
think naturally

412
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,080
think naturally
 

413
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,629
think naturally
uh are less frequent um

414
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:38,639
uh are less frequent um
 

415
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,790
uh are less frequent um
it's just a consequence of

416
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800
it's just a consequence of
 

417
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,550
it's just a consequence of
that the other point that is interesting

418
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:42,560
that the other point that is interesting
 

419
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,150
that the other point that is interesting
about the backstory is that it can

420
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,160
about the backstory is that it can
 

421
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,629
about the backstory is that it can
really make it more memorable in a way

422
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:46,639
really make it more memorable in a way
 

423
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,790
really make it more memorable in a way
and and by making it more memorable it's

424
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:48,800
and and by making it more memorable it's
 

425
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,790
and and by making it more memorable it's
it kind of sediments the knowledge more

426
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:50,800
it kind of sediments the knowledge more
 

427
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,589
it kind of sediments the knowledge more
in your mind i remember also reading the

428
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:53,599
in your mind i remember also reading the
 

429
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,749
in your mind i remember also reading the
sort of the backstory to

430
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759
sort of the backstory to
 

431
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,710
sort of the backstory to
to dijkstra's shortest path algorithm

432
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
to dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
 

433
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,189
to dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
right where he came up with it uh

434
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:01,199
right where he came up with it uh
 

435
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,950
right where he came up with it uh
essentially while he was

436
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:02,960
essentially while he was
 

437
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,430
essentially while he was
sitting down at a at a coffee shop in

438
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:05,440
sitting down at a at a coffee shop in
 

439
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,830
sitting down at a at a coffee shop in
amsterdam and he and he came up with

440
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:07,840
amsterdam and he and he came up with
 

441
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,150
amsterdam and he and he came up with
that algorithm over 20 minutes and one

442
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,160
that algorithm over 20 minutes and one
 

443
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,990
that algorithm over 20 minutes and one
interesting aspect is he didn't have any

444
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000
interesting aspect is he didn't have any
 

445
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,670
interesting aspect is he didn't have any
pen or paper at the time and so he had

446
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
pen or paper at the time and so he had
 

447
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,589
pen or paper at the time and so he had
to do it all in his mind and so

448
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:15,599
to do it all in his mind and so
 

449
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,430
to do it all in his mind and so
there's only so much complexity that you

450
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:17,440
there's only so much complexity that you
 

451
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,029
there's only so much complexity that you
can handle if you're just thinking about

452
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:19,039
can handle if you're just thinking about
 

453
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,430
can handle if you're just thinking about
it in your mind and that like when you

454
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440
it in your mind and that like when you
 

455
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,990
it in your mind and that like when you
think about the simplicity of dijkstra's

456
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,000
think about the simplicity of dijkstra's
 

457
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,869
think about the simplicity of dijkstra's
shortest path finding algorithm it's you

458
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:26,879
shortest path finding algorithm it's you
 

459
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,189
shortest path finding algorithm it's you
know knowing that backstory helps

460
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:29,199
know knowing that backstory helps
 

461
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,430
know knowing that backstory helps
sediment that algorithm in your mind so

462
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:31,440
sediment that algorithm in your mind so
 

463
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,269
sediment that algorithm in your mind so
that you don't forget about it as easily

464
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:33,279
that you don't forget about it as easily
 

465
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,990
that you don't forget about it as easily
it might be from you that i saw

466
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,000
it might be from you that i saw
 

467
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,430
it might be from you that i saw
a meme about texture

468
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:39,440
a meme about texture
 

469
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,430
a meme about texture
it's like he's trying to solve it he

470
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,440
it's like he's trying to solve it he
 

471
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,029
it's like he's trying to solve it he
comes up with some kind of random path

472
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:43,039
comes up with some kind of random path
 

473
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,949
comes up with some kind of random path
and then it's like my parents aren't

474
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
and then it's like my parents aren't
 

475
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,190
and then it's like my parents aren't
home and then he does uh

476
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:47,200
home and then he does uh
 

477
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,949
home and then he does uh
he figures out the algorithm for the

478
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959
he figures out the algorithm for the
 

479
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,910
he figures out the algorithm for the
shortest path

480
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:51,920

 

481
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,150

i strike through words to convey memes

482
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,160
i strike through words to convey memes
 

483
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,310
i strike through words to convey memes
but that's hilarious i don't know if

484
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,320
but that's hilarious i don't know if
 

485

but that's hilarious i don't know if
it's in post that we construct stories

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,870
newton there was no apple
especially when you're working on

492
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:04,880
especially when you're working on
 

493
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,150
especially when you're working on
problems that have a physical

494
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,160
problems that have a physical
 

495
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,070
problems that have a physical
manifestation or a visual manifestation

496
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,080
manifestation or a visual manifestation

00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,240
it feels like the world

it feels like the world
could be an inspiration to you

500
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:14,480
could be an inspiration to you
 

501
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,670
could be an inspiration to you
so it doesn't have to be completely in

502
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:17,680
so it doesn't have to be completely in
 

503
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,870
so it doesn't have to be completely in
on paper

504
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:18,880
on paper
 

505
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,790
on paper
like you could be sitting at a bar and

506
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800
like you could be sitting at a bar and
 

507
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,310
like you could be sitting at a bar and
all of a sudden see something and a

508
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,320
all of a sudden see something and a
 

509
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,910
all of a sudden see something and a
pattern will

510
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:23,920
pattern will
 

511
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,150
pattern will
will spark another pattern and you can

512
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
will spark another pattern and you can
 

513
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,790
will spark another pattern and you can
visualize it and rethink a problem in a

514
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
visualize it and rethink a problem in a
 

515
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,550
visualize it and rethink a problem in a
particular way

516
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:30,560
particular way
 

517
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,230
particular way
of course you can also load the math

518
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,240
of course you can also load the math
 

519
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,990
of course you can also load the math
that you have on paper and always carry

520
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,000
that you have on paper and always carry
 

521
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,509
that you have on paper and always carry
that with you so when you show up to the

522
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:35,519
that with you so when you show up to the
 

523
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,750
that with you so when you show up to the
bar some little inspiration could be the

563
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,470
forms it has a wit and a cleverness and
a humor about him so it does that come

a humor about him so it does that come
 

565
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,389
a humor about him so it does that come
into play in terms of the construction

into play in terms of the construction

well i think you brought up newton

570
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:27,279
well i think you brought up newton
 

571
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,430
well i think you brought up newton
newton is it's a good example also to

572
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:29,440
newton is it's a good example also to
 

573
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,110
newton is it's a good example also to
think about his backstory because you

574
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
think about his backstory because you
 

575
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,790
think about his backstory because you
know there's a certain backstory of

576
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:32,800
know there's a certain backstory of
 

577
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,350
know there's a certain backstory of
newton that people always talk about but

578
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:35,360
newton that people always talk about but
 

579
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,870
newton that people always talk about but
then there's a whole

580
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:36,880
then there's a whole
 

581
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,710
then there's a whole
another aspect of him

582
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:38,720
another aspect of him
 

583
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,550
another aspect of him
that is also a big part of the person

584
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:40,560
that is also a big part of the person
 

585
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,230
that is also a big part of the person
that he was but you know he was really

586
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,240
that he was but you know he was really
 

587
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,630
that he was but you know he was really
into alchemy right and that he spent a

588
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:44,640
into alchemy right and that he spent a
 

589
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,470
into alchemy right and that he spent a
lot of time

590
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:46,480
lot of time
 

591
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,389
lot of time
thinking about that and writing about it

592
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:48,399
thinking about that and writing about it
 

593
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,069
thinking about that and writing about it
and he took it very seriously he was

594
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:50,079
and he took it very seriously he was
 

595
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,710
and he took it very seriously he was
really into bible interpretation and

596
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:52,720
really into bible interpretation and
 

597
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,389
really into bible interpretation and
trying to predict things based on the

598
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
trying to predict things based on the
 

599
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,550
trying to predict things based on the
bible and so there's also a whole

600
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:56,560
bible and so there's also a whole
 

601
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,230
bible and so there's also a whole
backstory then and of course you need to

602
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,240
backstory then and of course you need to
 

603
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,949
backstory then and of course you need to
look at it in the context that and the

604
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
look at it in the context that and the
 

605
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,870
look at it in the context that and the
time that when newton lived um but a but

606
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:04,880
time that when newton lived um but a but
 

607
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,630
time that when newton lived um but a but
it adds to his personality and it's

608
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,640
it adds to his personality and it's
 

609
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,310
it adds to his personality and it's
important to also understand those

610
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:08,320
important to also understand those
 

611
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,750
important to also understand those
aspects then maybe

612
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:09,760
aspects then maybe
 

613
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,990
aspects then maybe
you know uh i'm not people people are

614
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,000
you know uh i'm not people people are
 

615
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,389
you know uh i'm not people people are
not as proud to teach to little kids

616
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:14,399
not as proud to teach to little kids
 

617
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,310
not as proud to teach to little kids
but it's important it was part of who he

618
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:16,320
but it's important it was part of who he
 

619
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,550
but it's important it was part of who he
was and and maybe without those he who

620
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:18,560
was and and maybe without those he who
 

621
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,630
was and and maybe without those he who
knows what he would have done otherwise

622
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:20,640
knows what he would have done otherwise
 

623
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,750
knows what he would have done otherwise
so

624
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:21,760
so
 

625
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,310
so
well the the cool thing about alchemy

626
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:24,320
well the the cool thing about alchemy
 

627
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,150
well the the cool thing about alchemy
i don't know how it was viewed at the

628
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
i don't know how it was viewed at the
 

629
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,430
i don't know how it was viewed at the
time

630
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:27,440
time
 

631
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,470
time
but it almost like to me symbolizes

632
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:30,480
but it almost like to me symbolizes
 

633
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,870
but it almost like to me symbolizes
dreaming of the impossible

634
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:32,880
dreaming of the impossible
 

635
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,350
dreaming of the impossible
like most of the breakthrough ideas kind

636
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:35,360
like most of the breakthrough ideas kind
 

637
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,949
like most of the breakthrough ideas kind
of seem impossible until they're

638
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:36,959
of seem impossible until they're
 

639
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,710
of seem impossible until they're
actually done it's like achieving human

640
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:38,720
actually done it's like achieving human
 

641
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,030
actually done it's like achieving human
flight it's not completely obvious to me

642
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,040
flight it's not completely obvious to me
 

643
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,670
flight it's not completely obvious to me
that alchemy is impossible or like

644
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
that alchemy is impossible or like
 

645
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,910
that alchemy is impossible or like
putting myself in the mindset of the

646
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:45,920
putting myself in the mindset of the
 

647
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,110
putting myself in the mindset of the
time

648
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,120
time
 

649
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,190
time
and perhaps even still

650
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200
and perhaps even still
 

651
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,590
and perhaps even still
every everything that uh

652
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:51,600
every everything that uh
 

653
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,870
every everything that uh
you know some of the most incredible

654
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:52,880
you know some of the most incredible
 

655
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,629
you know some of the most incredible
breakthroughs are

656
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:54,639
breakthroughs are
 

657
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,550
breakthroughs are
would seem impossible

658
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:56,560
would seem impossible
 

659
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,150
would seem impossible
and i wonder the value of

660
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,160
and i wonder the value of
 

661
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,350
and i wonder the value of
believing

662
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:01,360
believing
 

663
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,829
believing
almost like focusing and dreaming of the

664
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:03,839
almost like focusing and dreaming of the
 

665
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,710
almost like focusing and dreaming of the
impossible such that it is actually is

666
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:06,720
impossible such that it is actually is
 

667
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,829
impossible such that it is actually is
possible in your mind and that in itself

668
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:08,839
possible in your mind and that in itself
 

669
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,389
possible in your mind and that in itself
manifests

670
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:10,399
manifests
 

671
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,509
manifests
whether the accomplishing that goal or

672
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:13,519
whether the accomplishing that goal or
 

673
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,269
whether the accomplishing that goal or
making progress in some unexpected

674
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:15,279
making progress in some unexpected
 

675
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,509
making progress in some unexpected
direction so alchemy almost symbolizes

676
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:17,519
direction so alchemy almost symbolizes
 

677
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,550
direction so alchemy almost symbolizes
that for me i distinctly remember having

678
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:20,560
that for me i distinctly remember having
 

679
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,910
that for me i distinctly remember having
the same thought of thinking you know

680
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:21,920
the same thought of thinking you know
 

681
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,910
the same thought of thinking you know
when i learned about atoms and that they

682
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:23,920
when i learned about atoms and that they
 

683
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,590
when i learned about atoms and that they
have protons and electrons i was like

684
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:25,600
have protons and electrons i was like
 

685
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,509
have protons and electrons i was like
okay to make gold you just take whatever

686
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:27,519
okay to make gold you just take whatever
 

687
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,590
okay to make gold you just take whatever
has an atomic weight below it and then

688
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:29,600
has an atomic weight below it and then
 

689
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,030
has an atomic weight below it and then
shove another proton in there and then

690
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,040
shove another proton in there and then
 

691
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,190
shove another proton in there and then
you have a bunch of gold so like why

692
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:33,200
you have a bunch of gold so like why
 

693
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,629
you have a bunch of gold so like why
don't people do that

694
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:34,639
don't people do that
 

695
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,310
don't people do that
it seemed like conceptually is like you

696
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:36,320
it seemed like conceptually is like you
 

697
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,310
it seemed like conceptually is like you
know this sounds feasible you might be

698
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:38,320
know this sounds feasible you might be
 

699
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,389
know this sounds feasible you might be
able to do it and you can actually it's

700
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:40,399
able to do it and you can actually it's
 

701
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,230
able to do it and you can actually it's
just very very expensive yeah yeah

702
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,240
just very very expensive yeah yeah
 

703
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,790
just very very expensive yeah yeah
exactly exactly so in a sense we do have

704
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:44,800
exactly exactly so in a sense we do have
 

705
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,550
exactly exactly so in a sense we do have
alchemy and

706
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:46,560
alchemy and
 

707
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,389
alchemy and
maybe even back then it wasn't as crazy

708
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:48,399
maybe even back then it wasn't as crazy
 

709
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,710
maybe even back then it wasn't as crazy
that he was so into it

710
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:50,720
that he was so into it
 

711
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,230
that he was so into it
but good people just don't like to talk

712
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:52,240
but good people just don't like to talk
 

713

we're actually trying to convince him to
 

747
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,509
we're actually trying to convince him to
annotate a paper on fermat's library

748
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:31,519
annotate a paper on fermat's library
 

749
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,870
annotate a paper on fermat's library
and i sent him an email asking him

750
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:34,880
and i sent him an email asking him
 

751
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,030
and i sent him an email asking him
if you could annotate a paper and his

752
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,040
if you could annotate a paper and his
 

753
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,509
if you could annotate a paper and his
response was something like i have very

754
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:39,519
response was something like i have very
 

755

limited knowledge i just know a couple
 

757
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,509
limited knowledge i just know a couple
of things about certain fields i'm not

758
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:43,519
of things about certain fields i'm not
 

759
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,150
of things about certain fields i'm not
sure if i'm qualified to do that that

760
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,160
sure if i'm qualified to do that that
 

761

767
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,389
won an opera fry's and worked on a bunch
of different fields um did some really

768
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:54,399
of different fields um did some really
 

769
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,350
of different fields um did some really
really

770
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:55,360
really
 

771
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,790
really
great work

great work
 

773
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,310
great work
and then just the interactions that i

774
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:58,320
and then just the interactions that i
 

775
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,389
and then just the interactions that i
had with him every time i asked him a

776
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:00,399
had with him every time i asked him a
 

777
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,949
had with him every time i asked him a
couple of questions about his papers and

778
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:02,959
couple of questions about his papers and
 

779
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,590
couple of questions about his papers and
uh he always responded saying i'm not

780
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:05,600
uh he always responded saying i'm not
 

781
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,829
uh he always responded saying i'm not
here to answer your questions i just

accomplished
 

795
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,990
accomplished
uh scientist and feynman was also a big

796
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,000
uh scientist and feynman was also a big
 

797
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,670
uh scientist and feynman was also a big
big inspiration in the sense that he was

00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:46,959
work in terms of um
 

819
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,670
work in terms of um
explaining physics to to the masses and

820
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:49,680
explaining physics to to the masses and
 

821
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,350
explaining physics to to the masses and
motivating and getting people interested

822
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:51,360
motivating and getting people interested
 

823
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,470
motivating and getting people interested
in physics

824
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:52,480
in physics
 

825
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,150
in physics
and that for me was was also a big

826
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,160
and that for me was was also a big
 

827
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,750
and that for me was was also a big
inspiration

828
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:55,760
inspiration
 

829
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,590
inspiration
yeah i like the childlike curiosity of

830
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:57,600
yeah i like the childlike curiosity of
 

831
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,870
yeah i like the childlike curiosity of
some of those folks like you mentioned

832
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:58,880
some of those folks like you mentioned
 

833
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,269
some of those folks like you mentioned
freeman i have daniel kahneman i got a

834
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:01,279
freeman i have daniel kahneman i got a
 

835
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,269
freeman i have daniel kahneman i got a
chance to meet and interact with

836
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:03,279
chance to meet and interact with
 

837
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,110
chance to meet and interact with
some some of these truly special

838
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:05,120
some some of these truly special
 

839
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,389
some some of these truly special
scientists

840
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:06,399
scientists
 

841
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,550
scientists
what makes them special is that even in

842
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:08,560
what makes them special is that even in
 

843
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,389
what makes them special is that even in
uh older age

844
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:10,399
uh older age
 

845
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,509
uh older age
they're still

846
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:11,519
they're still
 

847
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,670
they're still
like there's still that fire of

848
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:13,680
like there's still that fire of
 

849
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,910
like there's still that fire of
childlike curiosity that burns

850
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:15,920
childlike curiosity that burns
 

851
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,550
childlike curiosity that burns
and uh some of that is like not taking

852
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:18,560
and uh some of that is like not taking
 

853
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,150
and uh some of that is like not taking
yourself so seriously that you think

854
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,160
yourself so seriously that you think
 

855
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,829
yourself so seriously that you think
you've figured it all out

856
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:21,839
you've figured it all out
 

857
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,150
you've figured it all out
but almost like thinking that you don't

858
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,160
but almost like thinking that you don't
 

859
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,670
but almost like thinking that you don't
know much of it

860
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:25,680
know much of it
 

861
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,470
know much of it
and

862
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:26,480
and
 

863
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,230
and
that's like step one in having a great

864
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,240
that's like step one in having a great
 

865
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,350
that's like step one in having a great
conversation or collaboration or

866
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,360
conversation or collaboration or
 

867
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,430
conversation or collaboration or
exploring a scientific question it's

868
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:35,440
exploring a scientific question it's
 

869
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,829
exploring a scientific question it's
cool how the very thing that probably

870
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:37,839
cool how the very thing that probably
 

871
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,389
cool how the very thing that probably
earned people the nobel prize or

872
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:40,399
earned people the nobel prize or
 

873
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,749
earned people the nobel prize or
or work that's seminal in some way

874
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:43,759
or work that's seminal in some way
 

875
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,310
or work that's seminal in some way
is the very thing that still burns even

876
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,320
is the very thing that still burns even
 

877
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,430
is the very thing that still burns even
after

878
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:47,440
after
 

879
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,829
after
uh they've won the prize it's cool to

880
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:49,839
uh they've won the prize it's cool to
 

881
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,749
uh they've won the prize it's cool to
see and they're rare humans

882
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:51,759
see and they're rare humans
 

883
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,749
see and they're rare humans
it seems and to that point i remember

884
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:53,759
it seems and to that point i remember
 

885
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,350
it seems and to that point i remember
like the last email that i sent to

886
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:55,360
like the last email that i sent to
 

887
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,110
like the last email that i sent to
freeman dyson was like in his last

888
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,120
freeman dyson was like in his last
 

889
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,350
freeman dyson was like in his last
birthday he was really into number

890
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,360
birthday he was really into number
 

891
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,990
birthday he was really into number
theory and primes so what i did is i

892
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,000
theory and primes so what i did is i
 

893
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,629
theory and primes so what i did is i
took like a photo of him a picture and

894
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:04,639
took like a photo of him a picture and
 

895
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,030
took like a photo of him a picture and
then i turned that into like

896
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,040
then i turned that into like
 

897
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,949
then i turned that into like
a giant prime number

898
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:08,959
a giant prime number
 

899
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,110
a giant prime number
so i converted the picture into a bunch

900
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,120
so i converted the picture into a bunch
 

901
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,949
so i converted the picture into a bunch
of one and eight and then i moved some

902
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:12,959
of one and eight and then i moved some
 

903
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,350
of one and eight and then i moved some
numbers around until it was a prime

904
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:15,360
numbers around until it was a prime
 

905
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,350
numbers around until it was a prime
um and then i sent him that

906
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:17,360
um and then i sent him that
 

907
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,590
um and then i sent him that
also the the visual like it still looked

908
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:19,600
also the the visual like it still looked
 

909
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,269
also the the visual like it still looked
like the picture it's made up of a

910
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:21,279
like the picture it's made up of a
 

911
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,590
like the picture it's made up of a
problem that's tricky to do it's hard to

912
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:23,600
problem that's tricky to do it's hard to
 

913
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,150
problem that's tricky to do it's hard to
do it looks harder than it actually is

914
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,160
do it looks harder than it actually is
 

915
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,150
do it looks harder than it actually is
so the the way you do it is like you

916
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,160
so the the way you do it is like you
 

917
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,550
so the the way you do it is like you
convert the darker regions into eights

918
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:30,560
convert the darker regions into eights
 

919
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,030
convert the darker regions into eights
and the lighter regions in ones

920
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,040
and the lighter regions in ones
 

921
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,110
and the lighter regions in ones
and then there's just keep flipping yeah

922
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,120
and then there's just keep flipping yeah
 

923
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,030
and then there's just keep flipping yeah
but there's like some primality tests

924
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,040
but there's like some primality tests
 

925
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,110
but there's like some primality tests
that are cheaper from a computational

926
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,120
that are cheaper from a computational
 

927
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,990
that are cheaper from a computational
standpoint yes but what it tells you is

928
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,000
standpoint yes but what it tells you is
 

929
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,230
standpoint yes but what it tells you is
it excludes numbers that are not prime

930
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:46,240
it excludes numbers that are not prime
 

931
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,829
it excludes numbers that are not prime
then you end up with a set of numbers

932
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:47,839
then you end up with a set of numbers
 

933
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,350
then you end up with a set of numbers
that you don't know if they are prime or

934
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:49,360
that you don't know if they are prime or
 

935
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,069
that you don't know if they are prime or
not and then you run the full primality

936
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:52,079
not and then you run the full primality
 

937
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,590
not and then you run the full primality
test on that so you just have to keep

938
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:53,600
test on that so you just have to keep
 

939
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,829
test on that so you just have to keep
iterating on that and it was it was it's

940
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:55,839
iterating on that and it was it was it's
 

941
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,110
iterating on that and it was it was it's
it's funny because when he got the

942
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,120
it's funny because when he got the
 

943
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,710
it's funny because when he got the
picture he was like how did you do that

944
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:58,720
picture he was like how did you do that
 

945
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,110
picture he was like how did you do that
it was super curious too and then we got

946
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,120
it was super curious too and then we got
 

947
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,269
it was super curious too and then we got
into the details and again this was he

948
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:03,279
into the details and again this was he
 

949
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,470
into the details and again this was he
was already 90 i think 92 or something

950
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:06,480
was already 90 i think 92 or something
 

951
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,990
was already 90 i think 92 or something
and that curiosity was still there um

952
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,000
and that curiosity was still there um
 

953
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,390
and that curiosity was still there um
so you could really see that in in some

954
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:12,400
so you could really see that in in some
 

955
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,150
so you could really see that in in some
of these scientists

956
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,160
of these scientists
 

957
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,029
of these scientists
so could we talk about vermont's library

958
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:17,039
so could we talk about vermont's library
 

959
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,110
so could we talk about vermont's library
yeah absolutely what

960
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,120
yeah absolutely what
 

961
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,990
yeah absolutely what
is it

962
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,000
is it
 

963
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,710
is it
what's the main goal what's the dream

964
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:22,720
what's the main goal what's the dream
 

965
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,270
what's the main goal what's the dream
it is a platform for annotating papers

966
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:25,280
it is a platform for annotating papers
 

967
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,510
it is a platform for annotating papers
in its essence right and so academic

968
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:27,520
in its essence right and so academic
 

969
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,830
in its essence right and so academic
papers can be one of the densest forms

970
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:29,840
papers can be one of the densest forms
 

971
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,029
papers can be one of the densest forms
of content out there and generally

972
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:33,039
of content out there and generally
 

973
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,470
of content out there and generally
pretty hard to understand at times and

974
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:36,480
pretty hard to understand at times and
 

975
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,990
pretty hard to understand at times and
the idea is that you can make them more

976
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,000
the idea is that you can make them more
 

977
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,150
the idea is that you can make them more
accessible and easier to understand by

978
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:40,160
accessible and easier to understand by
 

979
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,549
accessible and easier to understand by
adding these rich annotations to the

980
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:42,559
adding these rich annotations to the
 

981
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,549
adding these rich annotations to the
site right and so we can just imagine a

982
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:44,559
site right and so we can just imagine a
 

983
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,310
site right and so we can just imagine a
pdf view on your browser and then you

984
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:46,320
pdf view on your browser and then you
 

985
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,750
pdf view on your browser and then you
have annotations on each side and then

986
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:47,760
have annotations on each side and then
 

987
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,830
have annotations on each side and then
when you click on them a sidebar expands

988
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:49,840
when you click on them a sidebar expands
 

989
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,510
when you click on them a sidebar expands
and then you have

990
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:51,520
and then you have
 

991
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,110
and then you have
annotations that support latex and

992
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,120
annotations that support latex and
 

993
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,230
annotations that support latex and
markdown

994
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:54,240
markdown
 

995
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,750
markdown
and so the idea is that you can

996
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:55,760
and so the idea is that you can
 

997
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,630
and so the idea is that you can
say explain a tougher part of a paper

998
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:58,640
say explain a tougher part of a paper
 

999
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,150
say explain a tougher part of a paper
where there's a step that is not

1000
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:00,160
where there's a step that is not
 

1001
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,669
where there's a step that is not
completely obvious

1002
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:01,679
completely obvious
 

1003
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,630
completely obvious
or you can add more context to it

1004
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:04,640
or you can add more context to it
 

1005
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,190
or you can add more context to it
and then over time papers can become

1006
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,200
and then over time papers can become
 

1007
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,470
and then over time papers can become
easier and

1008
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:08,480
easier and
 

1009
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,710
easier and
easier to understand and can evolve in a

1010
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:10,720
easier to understand and can evolve in a
 

1011
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,590
easier to understand and can evolve in a
way but it really came from

1012
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:13,600
way but it really came from
 

1013
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,510
way but it really came from
myself luige and two other friends we've

1014
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:15,520
myself luige and two other friends we've
 

1015
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,310
myself luige and two other friends we've
been

1016
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,320
been
 

1017
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,630
been
we've had this this long-running habit

1018
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:18,640
we've had this this long-running habit
 

1019
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,390
we've had this this long-running habit
of kind of running a journal club

1020
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:20,400
of kind of running a journal club
 

1021
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,990
of kind of running a journal club
amongst us we come from different

1022
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,000
amongst us we come from different
 

1023
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,909
amongst us we come from different
backgrounds right i studied cs we

1024
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:23,919
backgrounds right i studied cs we
 

1025
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,070
backgrounds right i studied cs we
studied physics and so we read papers

1026
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:26,080
studied physics and so we read papers
 

1027
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,270
studied physics and so we read papers
and present them to each other and uh

1028
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:29,280
and present them to each other and uh
 

1029
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,430
and present them to each other and uh
and then we tried to bring some of that

1030
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:31,440
and then we tried to bring some of that
 

1031
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,549
and then we tried to bring some of that
online and that's that's that's when we

1032
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:34,559
online and that's that's that's when we
 

1033
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,350
online and that's that's that's when we
decided to to to build fermat's library

1034
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:37,360
decided to to to build fermat's library
 

1035
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,150
decided to to to build fermat's library
um

1036
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,160
um
 

1037
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,830
um
then over time it kind of

1038
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:39,840
then over time it kind of
 

1039
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,830
then over time it kind of
grew into into something uh with with a

1040
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:43,840
grew into into something uh with with a
 

1041
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,150
grew into into something uh with with a
broader goal uh

1042
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,160
broader goal uh
 

1043
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,830
broader goal uh
and really what we're trying to do is

1044
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:47,840
and really what we're trying to do is
 

1045
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,110
and really what we're trying to do is
trying to help

1046
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,120
trying to help
 

1047
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,110
trying to help
uh move science in the in the the right

1048
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,120
uh move science in the in the the right
 

1049
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,310
uh move science in the in the the right
direction

1050
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:52,320
direction
 

1051
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,230
direction
that's really the ultimate goal and and

1052
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,240
that's really the ultimate goal and and
 

1053
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,390
that's really the ultimate goal and and
where we want to take it now so there's

1054
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:56,400
where we want to take it now so there's
 

1055
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,549
where we want to take it now so there's
a lot to be said so first of all for

1056
00:18:58,549 --> 00:18:58,559
a lot to be said so first of all for
 

1057
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,029
a lot to be said so first of all for
people who haven't seen it

1058
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:01,039
people who haven't seen it
 

1059
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,110
people who haven't seen it
the interface is exceptionally well done

1060
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,120
the interface is exceptionally well done
 

1061
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,950
the interface is exceptionally well done
that's like execution is really

1062
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:04,960
that's like execution is really
 

1063
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,870
that's like execution is really
important here absolutely the other

1064
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:06,880
important here absolutely the other
 

1065
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,789
important here absolutely the other
things just to mention

1066
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:08,799
things just to mention

for
 

1069
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,510
for
a large number of people apparently

1070
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:11,520
a large number of people apparently
 

1071
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,070
a large number of people apparently
which is new to me don't know what latex

1072
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,080
which is new to me don't know what latex
 

1073
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,350
which is new to me don't know what latex
is

1074
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:15,360
is
 

1075
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,310
is
so it's spelled like latex so be careful

1076
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:18,320
so it's spelled like latex so be careful
 

1077
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,470
so it's spelled like latex so be careful
googling it if you haven't before

uh
 

1083
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,990
uh
sorry i don't even know the correct

1084
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,000
sorry i don't even know the correct
 

1085
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,510
sorry i don't even know the correct
terminology type setting it's a

1086
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:25,520
terminology type setting it's a
 

1087
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,350
terminology type setting it's a
typesetting language

1088
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:27,360
typesetting language
 

1089
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,310
typesetting language
where it's you're basically program

1090
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:30,320
where it's you're basically program
 

1091
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,950
where it's you're basically program
writing a program that then generates

1092
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:32,960
writing a program that then generates
 

1093
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,870
writing a program that then generates
something that looks

1094
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:34,880
something that looks
 

1095
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,110
something that looks
from a typography perspective beautiful

1096
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,120
from a typography perspective beautiful
 

1097
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,990
from a typography perspective beautiful
absolutely and uh so a lot of academics

1098
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:40,000
absolutely and uh so a lot of academics
 

1099
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,870
absolutely and uh so a lot of academics
use it to write papers i i think there's

1100
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:42,880
use it to write papers i i think there's
 

1101
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,950
use it to write papers i i think there's
like a bunch of communities that use it

1102
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:44,960
like a bunch of communities that use it
 

1103
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,029
like a bunch of communities that use it
to write papers i would say it's

1104
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:47,039
to write papers i would say it's
 

1105
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,150
to write papers i would say it's
mathematics physics computer science

1106
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,160
mathematics physics computer science
 

1107
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,870
mathematics physics computer science
yeah that's yeah that's the because i'm

1108
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:52,880
yeah that's yeah that's the because i'm
 

1109
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,029
yeah that's yeah that's the because i'm
collaborating currently on a paper with

1110
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:55,039
collaborating currently on a paper with
 

1111
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,510
collaborating currently on a paper with
uh two neuroscientists from stanford and

1112
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:57,520
uh two neuroscientists from stanford and
 

1113
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,150
uh two neuroscientists from stanford and
they don't know what

1114
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:00,160
they don't know what
 

1115
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,310
they don't know what
so i'm using uh microsoft word and uh

1116
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:04,320
so i'm using uh microsoft word and uh
 

1117
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,990
so i'm using uh microsoft word and uh
mendeley

1118
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,000
mendeley
 

1119
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,669
mendeley
and like all of those kinds of things

1120
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:07,679
and like all of those kinds of things
 

1121
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:08,549
and like all of those kinds of things
and it's

1122
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:08,559
and it's
 

1123
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,190
and it's
and i'm being very zen like about about

1124
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:11,200
and i'm being very zen like about about
 

1125
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,750
and i'm being very zen like about about
the whole process but it's fascinating

1126
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:13,760
the whole process but it's fascinating
 

1127
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,310
the whole process but it's fascinating
it's a little heartbreaking actually

1128
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:16,320
it's a little heartbreaking actually
 

1129
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,070
it's a little heartbreaking actually
because uh

1130
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:18,080
because uh
 

1131
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,950
because uh
it actually it's it's funny to say but

1132
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:20,960
it actually it's it's funny to say but
 

1133
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,870
it actually it's it's funny to say but
uh and we'll talk about open science

1134
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:22,880
uh and we'll talk about open science
 

1135
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,230
uh and we'll talk about open science
actually the bigger mission behind for

1136
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:24,240
actually the bigger mission behind for
 

1137
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,669
actually the bigger mission behind for
mars libraries like

1138
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:25,679
mars libraries like
 

1139
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,750
mars libraries like
really opening up the world of science

1140
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:27,760
really opening up the world of science
 

1141
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,350
really opening up the world of science
to everybody

1142
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:29,360
to everybody
 

1143
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,430
to everybody
is these silly

1144
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:31,440
is these silly
 

1145
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,630
is these silly
two facts of like one community uses

1146
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:34,640
two facts of like one community uses
 

1147
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,590
two facts of like one community uses
latex and another uses word

1148
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:37,600
latex and another uses word
 

1149
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,630
latex and another uses word
is actually a barrier between them

1150
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:40,640
is actually a barrier between them
 

1151
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,390
is actually a barrier between them
that's like it's like boring and

1152
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:42,400
that's like it's like boring and
 

1153
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,230
that's like it's like boring and
practical in a sense but it makes it

1154
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:44,240
practical in a sense but it makes it
 

1155
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,230
practical in a sense but it makes it
very difficult to collaborate

1156
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:46,240
very difficult to collaborate
 

1157
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,149
very difficult to collaborate
just on that like i think there if there

1158
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:48,159
just on that like i think there if there
 

1159
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,669
just on that like i think there if there
are some people that should have

1160
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:49,679
are some people that should have
 

1161
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,510
are some people that should have
received like a nobel prize that but

1162
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:51,520
received like a nobel prize that but
 

1163
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,110
received like a nobel prize that but
we'll never get it and i think one of

1164
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:53,120
we'll never get it and i think one of
 

1165
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,590
we'll never get it and i think one of
those is like donald knuth because of

1166
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:55,600
those is like donald knuth because of
 

1167
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,750
those is like donald knuth because of
tech and latex and then

1168
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:57,760
tech and latex and then
 

1169
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,830
tech and latex and then
because it had a huge impact in terms of

1170
00:20:59,830 --> 00:20:59,840
because it had a huge impact in terms of
 

1171
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,110
because it had a huge impact in terms of
like just

1172
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:01,120
like just
 

1173
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,590
like just
making it easier for uh researchers to

1174
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:03,600
making it easier for uh researchers to
 

1175
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,669
making it easier for uh researchers to
put their content out there like making

1176
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:05,679
put their content out there like making
 

1177
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,909
put their content out there like making
it uniform as much as possible oh you

1178
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:07,919
it uniform as much as possible oh you
 

1179
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,390
it uniform as much as possible oh you
mean like a nobel peace prize well maybe

1180
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:10,400
mean like a nobel peace prize well maybe
 

1181
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,950
mean like a nobel peace prize well maybe
maybe a couple of peace prizes

1182
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:12,960
maybe a couple of peace prizes
 

1183
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,590
maybe a couple of peace prizes
maybe a nobel peace prize yeah

1184
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:15,600
maybe a nobel peace prize yeah
 

1185
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,390
maybe a nobel peace prize yeah
i

1186
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:16,400
i
 

1187
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,630
i
i think so i mean he at a very young age

1188
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:18,640
i think so i mean he at a very young age
 

1189
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,549
i think so i mean he at a very young age
got the touring award for his work in

1190
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:20,559
got the touring award for his work in
 

1191
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,230
got the touring award for his work in
algorithms and so on so yeah like an

1192
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:22,240
algorithms and so on so yeah like an
 

1193
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,230
algorithms and so on so yeah like an
incredible yeah like when i i think it's

1194
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:24,240
incredible yeah like when i i think it's
 

1195
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,110
incredible yeah like when i i think it's
in

1196
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,120
in
 

1197
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,549
in
it might be even the 60s but i think

1198
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:26,559
it might be even the 60s but i think
 

1199
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,710
it might be even the 60s but i think
it's the 70s that so when he was really

1200
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:28,720
it's the 70s that so when he was really
 

1201
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,789
it's the 70s that so when he was really
young and then he went on to do like

1202
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:30,799
young and then he went on to do like
 

1203
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,310
young and then he went on to do like
incredible work

1204
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:32,320
incredible work
 

1205
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,430
incredible work
with his book and uh yeah with tech that

1206
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,440
with his book and uh yeah with tech that
 

1207
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,270
with his book and uh yeah with tech that
people don't know and and going back

1208
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:37,280
people don't know and and going back
 

1209
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,230
people don't know and and going back
just one

1210
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,240
just one
 

1211
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,909
just one
on the reason why we we ended up because

1212
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:39,919
on the reason why we we ended up because
 

1213
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,750
on the reason why we we ended up because
i think this is interesting the reason

1214
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:41,760
i think this is interesting the reason
 

1215
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,510
i think this is interesting the reason
why we ended up using the name for mars

1216
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:43,520
why we ended up using the name for mars
 

1217
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,549
why we ended up using the name for mars
library this was because of uh vermont's

1218
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:46,559
library this was because of uh vermont's
 

1219
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,710
library this was because of uh vermont's
last theorem and from us livestream is

1220
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:48,720
last theorem and from us livestream is
 

1221
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,710
last theorem and from us livestream is
actually a funny story like so pierre de

1222
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:50,720
actually a funny story like so pierre de
 

1223
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,390
actually a funny story like so pierre de
fermat he was like a lawyer and he

1224
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:54,400
fermat he was like a lawyer and he
 

1225
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,470
fermat he was like a lawyer and he
wrote like on a book

1226
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:56,480
wrote like on a book
 

1227
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,710
wrote like on a book
that he had a solution to fermat's last

1228
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:58,720
that he had a solution to fermat's last
 

1229
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,149
that he had a solution to fermat's last
theorem which um but that didn't fit the

1230
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:02,159
theorem which um but that didn't fit the
 

1231
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,549
theorem which um but that didn't fit the
margin of that book

1232
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:04,559
margin of that book
 

1233
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,549
margin of that book
and so fermat's lie stream basically

1234
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:06,559
and so fermat's lie stream basically
 

1235
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,029
and so fermat's lie stream basically
states that there's no solution if you

1236
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:09,039
states that there's no solution if you
 

1237
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,149
states that there's no solution if you
have uh

1238
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:10,159
have uh
 

1239
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,470
have uh
integers a b and c there's no solution

1240
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:12,480
integers a b and c there's no solution
 

1241
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,470
integers a b and c there's no solution
to a to the power of n plus b to the

1242
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:14,480
to a to the power of n plus b to the
 

1243
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,029
to a to the power of n plus b to the
power of n equals to c to the power of

1244
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:17,039
power of n equals to c to the power of
 

1245
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:17,750
power of n equals to c to the power of
n

1246
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:17,760
n
 

1247
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,390
n
if n is bigger than two so there's

1248
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:20,400
if n is bigger than two so there's
 

1249
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,710
if n is bigger than two so there's
there's there's no solutions and

1250
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:22,720
there's there's no solutions and
 

1251
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,149
there's there's no solutions and
he said that

1252
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:24,159
he said that
 

1253
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:24,950
he said that
and

1254
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:24,960
and
 

1255
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,830
and
that problem remained open for almost

1256
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:27,840
that problem remained open for almost
 

1257
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,549
that problem remained open for almost
300 years i believe and a lot of the

1258
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:30,559
300 years i believe and a lot of the
 

1259
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,390
300 years i believe and a lot of the
most famous mathematicians tried to

1260
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:32,400
most famous mathematicians tried to
 

1261
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,230
most famous mathematicians tried to
tackle that problem no one was able to

1262
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:34,240
tackle that problem no one was able to
 

1263
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,110
tackle that problem no one was able to
figure that that out until andrea wiles

1264
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:37,120
figure that that out until andrea wiles
 

1265
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,909
figure that that out until andrea wiles
uh i think was in in the 90s was able to

1266
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:39,919
uh i think was in in the 90s was able to
 

1267
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,669
uh i think was in in the 90s was able to
publish the solution which was i i

1268
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:41,679
publish the solution which was i i
 

1269
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,070
publish the solution which was i i
believe almost 300 pages long

1270
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:44,080
believe almost 300 pages long
 

1271
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,470
believe almost 300 pages long
and so it's kind of an anecdote that you

1272
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:46,480
and so it's kind of an anecdote that you
 

1273
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,990
and so it's kind of an anecdote that you
know there's a lot of of knowledge and

1274
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,000
know there's a lot of of knowledge and
 

1275
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,149
know there's a lot of of knowledge and
insights that can be trapped

1276
00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:52,159
insights that can be trapped
 

1277
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,149
insights that can be trapped
in the margins then you and there's a

1278
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:54,159
in the margins then you and there's a
 

1279
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,750
in the margins then you and there's a
lot of potential energy that you can

1280
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:55,760
lot of potential energy that you can
 

1281
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,029
lot of potential energy that you can
release if you actually um spend some

1282
00:22:59,029 --> 00:22:59,039
release if you actually um spend some
 

1283
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,110
release if you actually um spend some
time trying to digest

1284
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,120
time trying to digest
 

1285
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,350
time trying to digest
that and that was the the the origin

1286
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:03,360
that and that was the the the origin
 

1287
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,630
that and that was the the the origin
story for

1288
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:04,640
story for
 

1289
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,230
story for
for the name yes you can share the

1290
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:06,240
for the name yes you can share the
 

1291
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,390
for the name yes you can share the
contents of the margins with the world

1292
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:08,400
contents of the margins with the world
 

1293
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,510
contents of the margins with the world
exactly that could inspire a solution or

1294
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:11,520
exactly that could inspire a solution or
 

1295
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,029
exactly that could inspire a solution or
a communication that then leads to a

1296
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:13,039
a communication that then leads to a
 

1297
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,270
a communication that then leads to a
solution but and and if you think about

1298
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:15,280
solution but and and if you think about
 

1299
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,669
solution but and and if you think about
papers like papers are as as jean was

1300
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:17,679
papers like papers are as as jean was

margins is kind of the same software

1352
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:14,559
margins is kind of the same software
 

1353
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,310
margins is kind of the same software
that we use to to run the journal club

1354
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:16,320
that we use to to run the journal club
 

1355
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,630
that we use to to run the journal club
and to host the annotations but we've

1356
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:18,640
and to host the annotations but we've
 

1357
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,110
and to host the annotations but we've
made that available for free to anybody

1358
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,120
made that available for free to anybody
 

1359
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,830
made that available for free to anybody
that wants to use it and so

1360
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:23,840
that wants to use it and so
 

1361
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,310
that wants to use it and so
folks use it at universities and

1362
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:26,320
folks use it at universities and
 

1363
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,269
folks use it at universities and
and

1364
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:27,279
and
 

1365
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,190
and
for running journal clubs

1366
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,200
for running journal clubs
 

1367
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,789
for running journal clubs
and and so we just made that freely

1368
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:30,799
and and so we just made that freely
 

1369
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,430
and and so we just made that freely
available and then librarian is a

1370
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:33,440
available and then librarian is a
 

1371
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,110
available and then librarian is a
browser extension that we developed that

1372
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:35,120
browser extension that we developed that
 

1373
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,669
browser extension that we developed that
is sort of an overlay on top of archive

1374
00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:37,679
is sort of an overlay on top of archive
 

1375
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,070
is sort of an overlay on top of archive
so it's about bringing some of the same

1376
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,080
so it's about bringing some of the same
 

1377
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,789
so it's about bringing some of the same
functionality around comments plus

1378
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:42,799
functionality around comments plus
 

1379
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,950
functionality around comments plus
adding some extra

1380
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:44,960
adding some extra
 

1381
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,430
adding some extra
niceties to to archive like being able

1382
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:47,440
niceties to to archive like being able
 

1383
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,909
niceties to to archive like being able
to very easily extract the references of

1384
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:49,919
to very easily extract the references of
 

1385
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,590
to very easily extract the references of
a paper that you're looking at or being

1386
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:51,600
a paper that you're looking at or being
 

1387
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,510
a paper that you're looking at or being
able to extract the bibtex in order to

1388
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:53,520
able to extract the bibtex in order to
 

1389
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,669
able to extract the bibtex in order to
cite that paper yourself

1390
00:24:55,669 --> 00:24:55,679
cite that paper yourself
 

1391
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,430
cite that paper yourself
so it's an overlay on top of archive the

1392
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:57,440
so it's an overlay on top of archive the
 

1393
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,710
so it's an overlay on top of archive the
idea is that you can have that

1394
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:58,720
idea is that you can have that
 

1395
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,950
idea is that you can have that
commenting interface without having to

1396
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:00,960
commenting interface without having to
 

1397
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,269
commenting interface without having to
leave archive it's kind of incredible i

1398
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:03,279
leave archive it's kind of incredible i
 

1399
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,789
leave archive it's kind of incredible i
didn't know about it

1400
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:04,799
didn't know about it
 

1401
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,190
didn't know about it
and once i've learned of it

1402
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:07,200
and once i've learned of it
 

1403
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,909
and once i've learned of it
it's like holy [\h__\h]

1404
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:09,919
it's like holy [\h__\h]
 

1405
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,149
it's like holy [\h__\h]
why isn't it more popular given how

1406
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:12,159
why isn't it more popular given how
 

1407
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,070
why isn't it more popular given how
popular archive is like everybody should

1408
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:14,080
popular archive is like everybody should
 

1409
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,750
popular archive is like everybody should
be using it archive sucks

1410
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:17,760

 

1411
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,310

or uh let me rephrase that it's limited

1412
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:20,320
or uh let me rephrase that it's limited
 

1413
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,510
or uh let me rephrase that it's limited
yeah in terms of what's interesting

1414
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:21,520
yeah in terms of what's interesting
 

1415
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,310
yeah in terms of what's interesting
archive is a pretty incredible project

1416
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:24,320
archive is a pretty incredible project
 

1417
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,510
archive is a pretty incredible project
right and it is in in a way it's

1418
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:27,520
right and it is in in a way it's
 

1419
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,990
right and it is in in a way it's
it you know it the growth has been

1420
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:30,000
it you know it the growth has been
 

1421
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,230
it you know it the growth has been
completely linear over time if you look

1422
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:32,240
completely linear over time if you look
 

1423
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,750
completely linear over time if you look
at like number of papers published on

1424
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:33,760
at like number of papers published on
 

1425
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,430
at like number of papers published on
archive like you know it's just been

1426
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:35,440
archive like you know it's just been
 

1427
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,870
archive like you know it's just been
it's pretty much a straight line for the

1428
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:36,880
it's pretty much a straight line for the
 

1429
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,430
it's pretty much a straight line for the
past 20 years especially for you know

1430
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:39,440
past 20 years especially for you know
 

1431
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,269
past 20 years especially for you know
like if you're coming from a startup

1432
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:41,279
like if you're coming from a startup
 

1433
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,710
like if you're coming from a startup
background and then you were trying to

1434
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:42,720
background and then you were trying to
 

1435
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,029
background and then you were trying to
do archive you'd probably try like all

1436
00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:45,039
do archive you'd probably try like all
 

1437
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,669
do archive you'd probably try like all
sorts of growth acts and like try to

1438
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:47,679
sorts of growth acts and like try to
 

1439
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,230
sorts of growth acts and like try to
to then maybe like have paid features

1440
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:50,240
to then maybe like have paid features
 

1441
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,750
to then maybe like have paid features
and things like that and that would kind

1442
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:51,760
and things like that and that would kind
 

1443
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,390
and things like that and that would kind
of maybe ruin it and so there's

1444
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:54,400
of maybe ruin it and so there's
 

1445
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,470
of maybe ruin it and so there's
there's a subtle balance there yeah and

1446
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:56,480
there's a subtle balance there yeah and
 

1447
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,630
there's a subtle balance there yeah and
i don't know what what aspects you can

1448
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:58,640
i don't know what what aspects you can
 

1449
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,110
i don't know what what aspects you can
change about it and yeah for some tools

1450
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:01,120
change about it and yeah for some tools
 

1451
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,190
change about it and yeah for some tools
in science it just takes time for them

1452
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:03,200
in science it just takes time for them
 

1453
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,070
in science it just takes time for them
to to grow archive is just turned 30 i

1454
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:06,080
to to grow archive is just turned 30 i
 

1455
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,830
to to grow archive is just turned 30 i
believe yeah and for for people that

1456
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:07,840
believe yeah and for for people that
 

1457
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,430
believe yeah and for for people that
don't know archive is these kind of

1458
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:09,440
don't know archive is these kind of
 

1459
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,549
don't know archive is these kind of
online repository where people put

1460
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:12,559
online repository where people put
 

1461
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,390
online repository where people put
preprints which are versions of the

1462
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:14,400
preprints which are versions of the
 

1463
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,390
preprints which are versions of the
papers before they actually make it to

1464
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:16,400
papers before they actually make it to
 

1465
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,830
papers before they actually make it to
journals

1466
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:18,840
journals
 

1467
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,510
journals
a-r-x-i-v exactly for people who don't

1468
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:21,520
a-r-x-i-v exactly for people who don't
 

1469
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,510
a-r-x-i-v exactly for people who don't
know and it's actually a really vibrant

1470
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:23,520
know and it's actually a really vibrant
 

1471
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,390
know and it's actually a really vibrant
place to publish your papers in in the

1472
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:26,400
place to publish your papers in in the
 

1473
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,149
place to publish your papers in in the
aforementioned

1474
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:28,159
aforementioned
 

1475
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,149
aforementioned
uh communities of mathematics exactly in

1476
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:30,159
uh communities of mathematics exactly in
 

1477
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,669
uh communities of mathematics exactly in
computer science it started with

1478
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:31,679
computer science it started with
 

1479
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,669
computer science it started with
mathematics and physics and then over

1480
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:33,679
mathematics and physics and then over
 

1481
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,390
mathematics and physics and then over
the the last 30 years it evolved and now

1482
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:36,400
the the last 30 years it evolved and now
 

1483
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,070
the the last 30 years it evolved and now
actually computer computer science now

1484
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:38,080
actually computer computer science now
 

1485
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,310
actually computer computer science now
it's it's a more popular category than

1486
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:40,320
it's it's a more popular category than
 

1487
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,310
it's it's a more popular category than
than physics and math on archive and

1488
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:42,320
than physics and math on archive and
 

1489
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,390
than physics and math on archive and
there's also which i don't know very

1490
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:44,400
there's also which i don't know very
 

1491
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,830
there's also which i don't know very
much about like a

1492
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:45,840
much about like a
 

1493
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,070
much about like a
biology medical version of that bio

1494
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,080
biology medical version of that bio
 

1495
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,710
biology medical version of that bio
archive yeah by archive um it's recent

1496
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:50,720
archive yeah by archive um it's recent
 

1497
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,789
archive yeah by archive um it's recent
it's um it's interesting because if you

1498
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:52,799
it's um it's interesting because if you
 

1499
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,669
it's um it's interesting because if you
look at like these um platforms for

1500
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:55,679
look at like these um platforms for
 

1501
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,510
look at like these um platforms for
preprints they are

1502
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:57,520
preprints they are
 

1503
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,269
preprints they are
they actually play a super important

1504
00:26:59,269 --> 00:26:59,279
they actually play a super important
 

1505
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,390
they actually play a super important
role because

1506
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:00,400
role because
 

1507
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,830
role because
if you look at a category like math

1508
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:03,840
if you look at a category like math
 

1509
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,710
if you look at a category like math
for some papers in math it might take

1510
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:06,720
for some papers in math it might take
 

1511
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,029
for some papers in math it might take
close to three years

1512
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:09,039
close to three years
 

1513
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,430
close to three years
after you click upload paper on the

1514
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:11,440
after you click upload paper on the
 

1515
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,190
after you click upload paper on the
journal website and the paper gets

1516
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:13,200
journal website and the paper gets
 

1517
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,510
journal website and the paper gets
published on the website of the journal

1518
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:15,520
published on the website of the journal
 

1519
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,149
published on the website of the journal
so this is literally the longest

1520
00:27:18,149 --> 00:27:18,159
so this is literally the longest
 

1521
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,389
so this is literally the longest
upload period on the internet

1522
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:20,399
upload period on the internet
 

1523
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,430
upload period on the internet
um and during those three years like

1524
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:23,440
um and during those three years like
 

1525
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,269
um and during those three years like
it's it's you know

1526
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:25,279
it's it's you know
 

1527
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,990
it's it's you know
their content is just you know locked

1528
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:28,000
their content is just you know locked
 

1529
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,909
their content is just you know locked
and so this that's why it's so important

1530
00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:29,919
and so this that's why it's so important
 

1531
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,149
and so this that's why it's so important
for people to have websites like archive

1532
00:27:32,149 --> 00:27:32,159
for people to have websites like archive
 

1533
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,149
for people to have websites like archive
so that you can share that before it

1534
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:34,159
so that you can share that before it
 

1535
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,909
so that you can share that before it
goes to the journal with the rest of the

1536
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:35,919
goes to the journal with the rest of the
 

1537
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,990
goes to the journal with the rest of the
world there was actually on archive that

1538
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,000
world there was actually on archive that
 

1539
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,630
world there was actually on archive that
uh perumann published the the three

1540
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:40,640
uh perumann published the the three
 

1541
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,149
uh perumann published the the three
pipers that led to the proof of the

1542
00:27:42,149 --> 00:27:42,159
pipers that led to the proof of the
 

1543
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,710
pipers that led to the proof of the
poincare conject conjecture and then you

1544
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:44,720
poincare conject conjecture and then you
 

1545
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,630
poincare conject conjecture and then you
have other fields like

1546
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:46,640
have other fields like
 

1547
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,710
have other fields like
machine learning for instance where the

1548
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:48,720
machine learning for instance where the
 

1549
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,870
machine learning for instance where the
the field is evolving at such a high

1550
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:50,880
the field is evolving at such a high
 

1551
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,269
the field is evolving at such a high
rate that people don't even wait before

1552
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:53,279
rate that people don't even wait before
 

1553
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,190
rate that people don't even wait before
the papers go to journals before they

1554
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:55,200
the papers go to journals before they
 

1555
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,190
the papers go to journals before they
start working on top of those papers so

1556
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:57,200
start working on top of those papers so
 

1557
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,950
start working on top of those papers so
they publish them on archive then other

1558
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:58,960
they publish them on archive then other
 

1559
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,389
they publish them on archive then other
people see them they start working on

1560
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:00,399
people see them they start working on
 

1561
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,190
people see them they start working on
that and archive did a really good job

1562
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:03,200
that and archive did a really good job
 

1563
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,430
that and archive did a really good job
at like building that core platform to

1564
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:05,440
at like building that core platform to
 

1565
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,510
at like building that core platform to
host papers but i i think there's a

1566
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:07,520
host papers but i i think there's a
 

1567
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,669
host papers but i i think there's a
really really big opportunity in

1568
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:09,679
really really big opportunity in
 

1569
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,350
really really big opportunity in
building more features on top of that

1570
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:11,360
building more features on top of that
 

1571
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,430
building more features on top of that
platform apart from just hosting paper

1572
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:13,440
platform apart from just hosting paper
 

1573
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,470
platform apart from just hosting paper
so collaboration annotations and

1574
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:16,480
so collaboration annotations and
 

1575
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,470
so collaboration annotations and
like having other things apart from from

1576
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:18,480
like having other things apart from from
 

1577
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,630
like having other things apart from from
papers like code um

1578
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:20,640
papers like code um
 

1579
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,590
papers like code um
and and other things because uh in the

1580
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:23,600
and and other things because uh in the
 

1581
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,430
and and other things because uh in the
field like machine learning there's a

1582
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:25,440
field like machine learning there's a
 

1583
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,350
field like machine learning there's a
really big you know as i mentioned

1584
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:27,360
really big you know as i mentioned
 

1585
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,950
really big you know as i mentioned
people start working on on top of

1586
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:28,960
people start working on on top of
 

1587
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,950
people start working on on top of
preprints and they are assuming that

1588
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:30,960
preprints and they are assuming that
 

1589
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,990
preprints and they are assuming that
that

1590
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:32,000
that
 

1591
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,830
that
that preprint is correct

1592
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:33,840
that preprint is correct
 

1593
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,830
that preprint is correct
but you really need a way for instance

1594
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:35,840
but you really need a way for instance
 

1595
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,350
but you really need a way for instance
to maybe

1596
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:37,360
to maybe
 

1597
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,190
to maybe
it's not peer review but

1598
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:39,200
it's not peer review but
 

1599
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,510
it's not peer review but
distinguish what is good work from bad

1600
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:41,520
distinguish what is good work from bad
 

1601
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,149
distinguish what is good work from bad
work on archive how do you do that so

1602
00:28:44,149 --> 00:28:44,159
work on archive how do you do that so
 

1603
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,830
work on archive how do you do that so
like a commenting interface like

1604
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:45,840
like a commenting interface like
 

1605
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,750
like a commenting interface like
librarian it's useful for that so that

1606
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:47,760
librarian it's useful for that so that
 

1607
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,789
librarian it's useful for that so that
you can distinguish that um at

1608
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:50,799
you can distinguish that um at
 

1609
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,389
you can distinguish that um at
in the field that is growing so fast as

1610
00:28:52,389 --> 00:28:52,399
in the field that is growing so fast as
 

1611
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,470
in the field that is growing so fast as
machine learning and um and then you

1612
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:54,480
machine learning and um and then you
 

1613
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,350
machine learning and um and then you
have

1614
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:55,360
have
 

1615
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,029
have
platforms that focus for instance on

1616
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:57,039
platforms that focus for instance on
 

1617
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,029
platforms that focus for instance on
just biology bioarchive is a good

1618
00:28:59,029 --> 00:28:59,039
just biology bioarchive is a good
 

1619
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,190
just biology bioarchive is a good
example um

1620
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:01,200
example um
 

1621
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,029
example um
bioarchive is also super interesting

1622
00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:03,039
bioarchive is also super interesting
 

1623
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,669
bioarchive is also super interesting
because there there's actually

1624
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:05,679
because there there's actually
 

1625
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,470
because there there's actually
an interesting experiment that was run

1626
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:08,480
an interesting experiment that was run
 

1627
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,470
an interesting experiment that was run
in the 60s so in the 60s the nih um

1628
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:12,480
in the 60s so in the 60s the nih um
 

1629
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,710
in the 60s so in the 60s the nih um
supported this pro this

1630
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:14,720
supported this pro this
 

1631
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,389
supported this pro this
this experiment called the information

1632
00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:16,399
this experiment called the information
 

1633
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:17,990
this experiment called the information
exchange group

1634
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,000
exchange group
 

1635
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,310
exchange group
which at the time was a way for

1636
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:20,320
which at the time was a way for
 

1637
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,350
which at the time was a way for
researchers to share biology preprints

1638
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:23,360
researchers to share biology preprints
 

1639
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,310
researchers to share biology preprints
via mail or using libraries and that

1640
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:26,320
via mail or using libraries and that
 

1641
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,870
via mail or using libraries and that
project in the 1960s got cancelled six

1642
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:28,880
project in the 1960s got cancelled six
 

1643
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,350
project in the 1960s got cancelled six
years after it started and it was due to

1644
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:31,360
years after it started and it was due to
 

1645
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,669
years after it started and it was due to
intense pressure from the journals to

1646
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:33,679
intense pressure from the journals to
 

1647
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,750
intense pressure from the journals to
kill that project because they they were

1648
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:35,760
kill that project because they they were
 

1649
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,510
kill that project because they they were
fearing a competition from from the

1650
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:39,520
fearing a competition from from the
 

1651
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,310
fearing a competition from from the
uh

1652
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:40,320
uh
 

1653
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,909
uh
for in for the journal industry creek uh

1654
00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:43,919
for in for the journal industry creek uh
 

1655
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,230
for in for the journal industry creek uh
was also uh was one of the famous

1656
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:46,240
was also uh was one of the famous
 

1657
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,909
was also uh was one of the famous
scientists that opposed

1658
00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:47,919
scientists that opposed
 

1659
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,950
scientists that opposed
to to the uh information exchange group

1660
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:50,960
to to the uh information exchange group
 

1661
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,710
to to the uh information exchange group
and it's interesting because right now

1662
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:52,720
and it's interesting because right now
 

1663
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,389
and it's interesting because right now
if you analyze the number of biology

1664
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:54,399
if you analyze the number of biology
 

1665
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,990
if you analyze the number of biology
papers that

1666
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:56,000
papers that
 

1667
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,549
papers that
appear first as preprints it's only two

1668
00:29:58,549 --> 00:29:58,559
appear first as preprints it's only two
 

1669
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,389
appear first as preprints it's only two
percent of the papers

1670
00:30:00,389 --> 00:30:00,399
percent of the papers
 

1671
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,029
percent of the papers
and it this was almost 50 almost 50

1672
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:03,039
and it this was almost 50 almost 50
 

1673
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,789
and it this was almost 50 almost 50
years after that first experiment so you

1674
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:04,799
years after that first experiment so you
 

1675
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,549
years after that first experiment so you
can see like that pressure from the

1676
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:06,559
can see like that pressure from the
 

1677
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,789
can see like that pressure from the
journals to cancel that uh initial

1678
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:08,799
journals to cancel that uh initial
 

1679
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,190
journals to cancel that uh initial
version of a pre-print repo had a

1680
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:11,200
version of a pre-print repo had a
 

1681
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,549
version of a pre-print repo had a
tremendous impact on on on the number of

1682
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:14,559
tremendous impact on on on the number of
 

1683
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,470
tremendous impact on on on the number of
papers that are showing up in biology as

1684
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:16,480
papers that are showing up in biology as
 

1685
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,350
papers that are showing up in biology as
preprints so it delayed a lot that

1686
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:19,360
preprints so it delayed a lot that
 

1687
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,669
preprints so it delayed a lot that
that revolution and um

1688
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:21,679
that revolution and um
 

1689
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,070
that revolution and um
but now platforms like bioarchive are

1690
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:24,080
but now platforms like bioarchive are
 

1691
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,070
but now platforms like bioarchive are
doing that work but there's still a lot

1692
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:26,080
doing that work but there's still a lot
 

1693
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,909
doing that work but there's still a lot
of room for growth there and i think

1694
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:27,919
of room for growth there and i think
 

1695
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,110
of room for growth there and i think
it's super important because those are

1696
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,120
it's super important because those are
 

1697
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,549
it's super important because those are
the papers that are open that everyone

1698
00:30:30,549 --> 00:30:30,559
the papers that are open that everyone
 

1699
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,830
the papers that are open that everyone
can read

1700
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:31,840
can read
 

1701
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,669
can read
okay so but if we just look at the

1702
00:30:33,669 --> 00:30:33,679
okay so but if we just look at the
 

1703
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,590
okay so but if we just look at the
entire process of science as a big

1704
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:35,600
entire process of science as a big
 

1705
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,909
entire process of science as a big
system can we just talk about how it can

1706
00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:37,919
system can we just talk about how it can
 

1707
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,990
system can we just talk about how it can
be revolutionized

1708
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:40,000
be revolutionized
 

1709
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,950
be revolutionized
so

1710
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:40,960
so
 

1711
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,710
so
you have an idea

1712
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:42,720
you have an idea
 

1713
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,190
you have an idea
uh depending on the field you want to

1714
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:45,200
uh depending on the field you want to
 

1715
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,110
uh depending on the field you want to
make that idea concrete you want to run

1716
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:47,120
make that idea concrete you want to run
 

1717
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,029
make that idea concrete you want to run
a few experiments in computer science

1718
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:49,039
a few experiments in computer science
 

1719
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,110
a few experiments in computer science
there might be some code

1720
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:51,120
there might be some code
 

1721
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,190
there might be some code
there'd be a data set

1722
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:53,200
there'd be a data set
 

1723
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,669
there'd be a data set
for you know some of the more sort of

1724
00:30:55,669 --> 00:30:55,679
for you know some of the more sort of
 

1725
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,269
for you know some of the more sort of
biology

1726
00:30:57,269 --> 00:30:57,279
biology
 

1727
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,269
biology
psychology

1728
00:30:59,269 --> 00:30:59,279
psychology
 

1729
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,750
psychology
you might be collecting the data set

1730
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:01,760
you might be collecting the data set
 

1731
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,430
you might be collecting the data set
that's called you know a study right

1732
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:05,440
that's called you know a study right
 

1733
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,110
that's called you know a study right
so that's part of that that's part of

1734
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:07,120
so that's part of that that's part of
 

1735
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,750
so that's part of that that's part of
the methodology and so you are putting

1736
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:09,760
the methodology and so you are putting
 

1737
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,630
the methodology and so you are putting
all that into a paper form

1738
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:12,640
all that into a paper form
 

1739
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,990
all that into a paper form
and then

1740
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:14,000
and then
 

1741
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,750
and then
you have some results

1742
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:15,760
you have some results
 

1743
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,990
you have some results
and then you you submit that to a place

1744
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:18,000
and then you you submit that to a place
 

1745
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,190
and then you you submit that to a place
for

1746
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:19,200
for
 

1747
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,669
for
review through the peer review process

1748
00:31:21,669 --> 00:31:21,679
review through the peer review process
 

1749
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,070
review through the peer review process
and there's a process where how would

1750
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,080
and there's a process where how would
 

1751
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,669
and there's a process where how would
you summarize the peer review process

1752
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:25,679
you summarize the peer review process
 

1753
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,230
you summarize the peer review process
but it's it's really just like a handful

1754
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:28,240
but it's it's really just like a handful
 

1755
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,830
but it's it's really just like a handful
of people look over your paper and

1756
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:29,840
of people look over your paper and
 

1757
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,389
of people look over your paper and
comment and based on that decide whether

1758
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:32,399
comment and based on that decide whether
 

1759
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,470
comment and based on that decide whether
your paper is good or not

1760
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:34,480
your paper is good or not
 

1761
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,350
your paper is good or not
so there's a whole broken nature to it

1762
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:37,360
so there's a whole broken nature to it
 

1763
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,430
so there's a whole broken nature to it
at the same time i love the peer review

1764
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:39,440
at the same time i love the peer review
 

1765
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,470
at the same time i love the peer review
process when i buy stuff on amazon

1766
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:42,480
process when i buy stuff on amazon
 

1767
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,870
process when i buy stuff on amazon
like uh

1768
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:44,880
like uh
 

1769
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,789
like uh
for like uh the commenting system

1770
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:46,799
for like uh the commenting system
 

1771
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,789
for like uh the commenting system

which is the collaborative aspect of the
 

1779
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,630
which is the collaborative aspect of the
science which is people annotating

there's one a single user that edited
 

1901
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,470
there's one a single user that edited
one third of the articles on wikipedia

most of the community like if you create

1936
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:41,520
most of the community like if you create
 

1937
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,470
most of the community like if you create
a really powerful system for archive

1938
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:44,480
a really powerful system for archive
 

1939
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,470
a really powerful system for archive
or like open review it made it really

1940
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:46,480
or like open review it made it really
 

1941
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,589
or like open review it made it really
easy

1942
00:34:47,589 --> 00:34:47,599
easy
 

1943
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,829
easy
and compelling

1944
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:49,839
and compelling
 

1945
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,030
and compelling
and exciting for one person who isn't

1946
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:53,040
and exciting for one person who isn't
 

1947
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,470
and exciting for one person who isn't
like a 10x contributor to do their thing

1948
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:56,480
like a 10x contributor to do their thing
 

1949
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,990
like a 10x contributor to do their thing
that's going to change everything it

1950
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:58,000
that's going to change everything it
 

1951
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,589
that's going to change everything it
seems like that was the mechanism that

1952
00:34:59,589 --> 00:34:59,599
seems like that was the mechanism that
 

1953
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,349
seems like that was the mechanism that
changed everything for wikipedia and

1954
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:01,359
changed everything for wikipedia and
 

1955
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:02,710
changed everything for wikipedia and
that's the mechanism that changed

1956
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:02,720
that's the mechanism that changed
 

1957
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,270
that's the mechanism that changed
everything for stack overflow is

1958
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:05,280
everything for stack overflow is
 

1959
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,270
everything for stack overflow is
gamifying or making it exciting or just

1960
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:07,280
gamifying or making it exciting or just
 

1961
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,829
gamifying or making it exciting or just
making it fun or pleasant or fulfilling

1962
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:09,839
making it fun or pleasant or fulfilling
 

1963
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,069
making it fun or pleasant or fulfilling
in some way for those people who are

1964
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:12,079
in some way for those people who are
 

1965
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,430
in some way for those people who are
insane

1966
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:13,440
insane
 

1967
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,910
insane
enough to like answer thousands of

1968
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:15,920
enough to like answer thousands of
 

1969
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,990
enough to like answer thousands of
questions or

1970
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,000
questions or
 

1971
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,710
questions or
write thousands of factoids and like

1972
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:20,720
write thousands of factoids and like
 

1973
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,230
write thousands of factoids and like
research them and check them all those

1974
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:22,240
research them and check them all those
 

1975
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,069
research them and check them all those
kinds of things or read thousands of

1976
00:35:24,069 --> 00:35:24,079
kinds of things or read thousands of
 

1977
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,190
kinds of things or read thousands of
papers yeah no stack overflow is another

1978
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,200
papers yeah no stack overflow is another
 

1979
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,589
papers yeah no stack overflow is another
great example of that and it's just

1980
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:29,599
great example of that and it's just
 

1981
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,990
great example of that and it's just
and and those are both to

1982
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:32,000
and and those are both to
 

1983
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,310
and and those are both to
incredibly productive communities that

1984
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:34,320
incredibly productive communities that
 

1985
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,950
incredibly productive communities that
generate a ton of value and and and

1986
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:36,960
generate a ton of value and and and
 

1987
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,470
generate a ton of value and and and
capture almost none of it right and it's

1988
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:40,480
capture almost none of it right and it's
 

1989
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,109
capture almost none of it right and it's
and you know in a way it's almost like

1990
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:43,119
and you know in a way it's almost like
 

1991
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,190
and you know in a way it's almost like
counter um

1992
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:45,200
counter um
 

1993
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,270
counter um
it's very counter-intuitive that that

1994
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:47,280
it's very counter-intuitive that that
 

1995
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,829
it's very counter-intuitive that that
that people that these communities would

1996
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:49,839
that people that these communities would
 

1997
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,310
that people that these communities would
exist and thrive um

1998
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:52,320
exist and thrive um
 

1999
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,950
exist and thrive um
and and it's really hard to

2000
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:54,960
and and it's really hard to
 

2001
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,349
and and it's really hard to
you there aren't that many communities

2002
00:35:57,349 --> 00:35:57,359
you there aren't that many communities
 

2003
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,270
you there aren't that many communities
like that so how do we do that for

2004
00:35:59,270 --> 00:35:59,280
like that so how do we do that for
 

2005
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,910
like that so how do we do that for
science do you have ideas there like

2006
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:01,920
science do you have ideas there like
 

2007
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,349
science do you have ideas there like
what are the biggest problems that you

2008
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:03,359
what are the biggest problems that you
 

2009
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,510
what are the biggest problems that you
see you're working on some of them

2010
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:05,520
see you're working on some of them
 

2011
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,870
see you're working on some of them
like just on that there are a couple of

2012
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:06,880
like just on that there are a couple of
 

2013
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,230
like just on that there are a couple of
really interesting experiments that

2014
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:08,240
really interesting experiments that
 

2015
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,230
really interesting experiments that
people are running an example would be

2016
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:10,240
people are running an example would be
 

2017
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,589
people are running an example would be
like the polymath projects so this is a

2018
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:13,599
like the polymath projects so this is a
 

2019
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,150
like the polymath projects so this is a
so kind of a social experiment that was

2020
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:16,160
so kind of a social experiment that was
 

2021
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,069
so kind of a social experiment that was
uh created by tim gowers

2022
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:18,079
uh created by tim gowers
 

2023
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,870
uh created by tim gowers
fields fields medalist and his idea was

2024
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:20,880
fields fields medalist and his idea was
 

2025
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,430
fields fields medalist and his idea was
to try to prove that is it possible to

2026
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:23,440
to try to prove that is it possible to
 

2027
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,349
to try to prove that is it possible to
do mathematics in a massively

2028
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:25,359
do mathematics in a massively
 

2029
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,990
do mathematics in a massively
collaborative collaborative way on the

2030
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,000
collaborative collaborative way on the
 

2031
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,069
collaborative collaborative way on the
internet so we decided to pick a couple

2032
00:36:30,069 --> 00:36:30,079
internet so we decided to pick a couple
 

2033
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,910
internet so we decided to pick a couple
of problems and

2034
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:31,920
of problems and
 

2035
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,030
of problems and
test that and they found out that it it

2036
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:35,040
test that and they found out that it it
 

2037
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,109
test that and they found out that it it
actually it is possible for a specific

2038
00:36:37,109 --> 00:36:37,119
actually it is possible for a specific
 

2039
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,710
actually it is possible for a specific
types of problems

2040
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:38,720
types of problems
 

2041
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,310
types of problems
namely problems that you're able to

2042
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:40,320
namely problems that you're able to
 

2043
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,630
namely problems that you're able to
break down in in little pieces and go

2044
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:42,640
break down in in little pieces and go
 

2045
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,950
break down in in little pieces and go
step by step you might need as as with

2046
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:44,960
step by step you might need as as with
 

2047
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,190
step by step you might need as as with
open source you might need people that

2048
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:47,200
open source you might need people that
 

2049
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,310
open source you might need people that
are just kind of reorganizing the the

2050
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:50,320
are just kind of reorganizing the the
 

2051
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,710
are just kind of reorganizing the the
house every once in a while and then you

2052
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:52,720
house every once in a while and then you
 

2053
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,470
house every once in a while and then you
know people throw a bunch of ideas and

2054
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:54,480
know people throw a bunch of ideas and
 

2055
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,150
know people throw a bunch of ideas and
then you know you make some progress

2056
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:56,160
then you know you make some progress
 

2057
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,829
then you know you make some progress
then you reorganize you reframe the

2058
00:36:57,829 --> 00:36:57,839
then you reorganize you reframe the
 

2059
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,310
then you reorganize you reframe the
problem you go step by step but they

2060
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:00,320
problem you go step by step but they
 

2061
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,470
problem you go step by step but they
were actually able to prove that it is

2062
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:02,480
were actually able to prove that it is
 

2063
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,910
were actually able to prove that it is
possible to to

2064
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:03,920
possible to to
 

2065
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,710
possible to to
uh collaborate online and and

2066
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:06,720
uh collaborate online and and
 

2067
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,910
uh collaborate online and and
do progress in terms of mathematics um

2068
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:09,920
do progress in terms of mathematics um
 

2069
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,990
do progress in terms of mathematics um
and so i'm i'm confident that there are

2070
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:12,000
and so i'm i'm confident that there are
 

2071
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,750
and so i'm i'm confident that there are
other avenues that could be explored

2072
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:13,760
other avenues that could be explored
 

2073
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,910
other avenues that could be explored
here can we talk about peer review for

2074
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:15,920
here can we talk about peer review for
 

2075
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,790
here can we talk about peer review for
example absolutely i i think like in in

2076
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:18,800
example absolutely i i think like in in
 

2077
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,950
example absolutely i i think like in in
terms of the peer review i think we it's

2078
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:20,960
terms of the peer review i think we it's
 

2079
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,349
terms of the peer review i think we it's
it's important to look at the bigger

2080
00:37:23,349 --> 00:37:23,359
it's important to look at the bigger
 

2081
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,190
it's important to look at the bigger
picture here of like

2082
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:25,200
picture here of like
 

2083
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,230
picture here of like
of what this scientific the scientific

2084
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:28,240
of what this scientific the scientific
 

2085
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,950
of what this scientific the scientific
publishing ecosystem looks like because

2086
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:30,960
publishing ecosystem looks like because
 

2087
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,910
publishing ecosystem looks like because
for me

2088
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:31,920
for me
 

2089
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,670
for me
there there are a lot of things that are

2090
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:33,680
there there are a lot of things that are
 

2091
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,390
there there are a lot of things that are
wrong about that entire process so

2092
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:36,400
wrong about that entire process so
 

2093
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,550
wrong about that entire process so
if you look at for instance at the what

2094
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:38,560
if you look at for instance at the what
 

2095
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,030
if you look at for instance at the what
publishing means in like a traditional

2096
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:41,040
publishing means in like a traditional
 

2097
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,310
publishing means in like a traditional
journal you have uh journals that pay um

2098
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:44,320
journal you have uh journals that pay um
 

2099
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,589
journal you have uh journals that pay um
authors

2100
00:37:45,589 --> 00:37:45,599
authors
 

2101
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,230
authors
for their articles and then they might

2102
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:48,240
for their articles and then they might
 

2103
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,910
for their articles and then they might
pay like reviewers to um review those

2104
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:51,920
pay like reviewers to um review those
 

2105
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,910
pay like reviewers to um review those
articles and finally they pay

2106
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:53,920
articles and finally they pay
 

2107
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,470
articles and finally they pay
people to um or distributors to

2108
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:56,480
people to um or distributors to
 

2109
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,150
people to um or distributors to
distribute the content

2110
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:58,160
distribute the content
 

2111
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,870
distribute the content
in in the scientific publishing world

2112
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:00,880
in in the scientific publishing world
 

2113
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,109
in in the scientific publishing world
you have scientists that are usually

2114
00:38:03,109 --> 00:38:03,119
you have scientists that are usually
 

2115
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,790
you have scientists that are usually
backed by government grants they are

2116
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:04,800
backed by government grants they are
 

2117
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,630
backed by government grants they are
giving away their work for free in the

2118
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:06,640
giving away their work for free in the
 

2119
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,990
giving away their work for free in the
form of papers

2120
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:08,000
form of papers
 

2121
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,150
form of papers
and then you have other scientists that

2122
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:10,160
and then you have other scientists that
 

2123
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,710
and then you have other scientists that
are reviewing their work

2124
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:12,720
are reviewing their work
 

2125
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,470
are reviewing their work
this process is known as the peer review

2126
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:14,480
this process is known as the peer review
 

2127
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,550
this process is known as the peer review
process again for free

2128
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:16,560
process again for free
 

2129
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,950
process again for free
and then finally we have um

2130
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:19,960
and then finally we have um
 

2131
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,470
and then finally we have um
government-backed universities and

2132
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:22,480
government-backed universities and
 

2133
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,950
government-backed universities and
libraries that are buying back

2134
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:24,960
libraries that are buying back
 

2135
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,990
libraries that are buying back
all those

2136
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,000
all those
 

2137
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,150
all those
all that work so that other scientists

2138
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,160
all that work so that other scientists
 

2139
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,630
all that work so that other scientists
can we can read so this is for me it's

2140
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:30,640
can we can read so this is for me it's
 

2141
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,230
can we can read so this is for me it's
bizarre you have the government that is

2142
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:32,240
bizarre you have the government that is
 

2143
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,150
bizarre you have the government that is
funding the research is paying the

2144
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:34,160
funding the research is paying the
 

2145
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,829
funding the research is paying the
salaries of the scientists it's paying

2146
00:38:35,829 --> 00:38:35,839
salaries of the scientists it's paying
 

2147
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,589
salaries of the scientists it's paying
the salaries of the reviewers and it's

2148
00:38:37,589 --> 00:38:37,599
the salaries of the reviewers and it's
 

2149
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,150
the salaries of the reviewers and it's
buying back all that uh the product of

2150
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:40,160
buying back all that uh the product of
 

2151
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,829
buying back all that uh the product of
their work again

2152
00:38:41,829 --> 00:38:41,839
their work again
 

2153
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,829
their work again
um and i think the problem with this

2154
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:43,839
um and i think the problem with this
 

2155
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,750
um and i think the problem with this
system and it's what it's why it's so

2156
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:45,760
system and it's what it's why it's so
 

2157
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,230
system and it's what it's why it's so
difficult to to break this

2158
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:48,240
difficult to to break this
 

2159
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,670
difficult to to break this
suboptimal equilibrium is because of of

2160
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:51,680
suboptimal equilibrium is because of of
 

2161
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,150
suboptimal equilibrium is because of of
the way academia works right now and the

2162
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:54,160
the way academia works right now and the
 

2163
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,109
the way academia works right now and the
way you can progress in in your academic

2164
00:38:57,109 --> 00:38:57,119
way you can progress in in your academic
 

2165
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:57,990
way you can progress in in your academic
life

2166
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:58,000
life
 

2167
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,430
life
and and so

2168
00:38:59,430 --> 00:38:59,440
and and so
 

2169
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,510
and and so
in a lot of fields the the competition

2170
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:01,520
in a lot of fields the the competition
 

2171
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,470
in a lot of fields the the competition
in academia is is really insane

2172
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:04,480
in academia is is really insane
 

2173
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,630
in academia is is really insane
so you have hundreds of phd students

2174
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:06,640
so you have hundreds of phd students
 

2175
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,750
so you have hundreds of phd students
there are um trying to get to

2176
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:09,760
there are um trying to get to
 

2177
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,190
there are um trying to get to
a professor position and and it's hyper

2178
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:13,200
a professor position and and it's hyper
 

2179
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,510
a professor position and and it's hyper
competitive and the only way for you to

2180
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:15,520
competitive and the only way for you to
 

2181
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,710
competitive and the only way for you to
get there

2182
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:16,720
get there
 

2183
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,630
get there
is if you publish papers ideally in

2184
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:20,640
is if you publish papers ideally in
 

2185
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,710
is if you publish papers ideally in
journals with a

2186
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:22,720
journals with a
 

2187
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,710
journals with a
high impact factor in computer science

2188
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:24,720
high impact factor in computer science
 

2189
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,790
high impact factor in computer science
it's all it's often conferences are also

2190
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:26,800
it's all it's often conferences are also
 

2191
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,230
it's all it's often conferences are also
very prestigious or actually more

2192
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:28,240
very prestigious or actually more
 

2193
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,069
very prestigious or actually more
prestigious than journals now

2194
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:30,079
prestigious than journals now
 

2195
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,750
prestigious than journals now
so interesting so that's the one

2196
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:31,760
so interesting so that's the one
 

2197
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,670
so interesting so that's the one
discipline where i mean that has to do

2198
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:33,680
discipline where i mean that has to do
 

2199
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,670
discipline where i mean that has to do
with the thing we've discussed uh in

2200
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:35,680
with the thing we've discussed uh in
 

2201
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,150
with the thing we've discussed uh in
terms of the how quickly the field turns

2202
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:38,160
terms of the how quickly the field turns
 

2203
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,150
terms of the how quickly the field turns
around but like uh in eurips cvpr those

2204
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:42,160
around but like uh in eurips cvpr those
 

2205
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,790
around but like uh in eurips cvpr those
conferences are more prestigious or at

2206
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:44,800
conferences are more prestigious or at
 

2207
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,550
conferences are more prestigious or at
the very least as prestigious as the

2208
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:46,560
the very least as prestigious as the
 

2209
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,910
the very least as prestigious as the
journal

2210
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:47,920
journal
 

2211
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,510
journal
but doesn't matter the process is what

2212
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:49,520
but doesn't matter the process is what
 

2213
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,150
but doesn't matter the process is what
it is and and and so with the the so for

2214
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:52,160
it is and and and so with the the so for
 

2215
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,670
it is and and and so with the the so for
people that don't know how the impact

2216
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:53,680
people that don't know how the impact
 

2217
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,349
people that don't know how the impact
factor of a journal is basically the

2218
00:39:55,349 --> 00:39:55,359
factor of a journal is basically the
 

2219
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,510
factor of a journal is basically the
average number of citations that a paper

2220
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:57,520
average number of citations that a paper
 

2221
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,589
average number of citations that a paper
would get if it gets published on that

2222
00:39:59,589 --> 00:39:59,599
would get if it gets published on that
 

2223
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:00,790
would get if it gets published on that
journal

2224
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:00,800
journal
 

2225
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,870
journal
but so um you can really think that

2226
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:04,880
but so um you can really think that
 

2227
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,589
but so um you can really think that
the problem with the the impact factor

2228
00:40:07,589 --> 00:40:07,599
the problem with the the impact factor
 

2229
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:10,470
the problem with the the impact factor
is that it's a way to turn papers into

2230
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:10,480
is that it's a way to turn papers into
 

2231
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,710
is that it's a way to turn papers into
accounting units

2232
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:12,720
accounting units
 

2233
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,430
accounting units
and and and let me unpack this because

2234
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:15,440
and and and let me unpack this because
 

2235
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,430
and and and let me unpack this because
it's the impact factor is almost like a

2236
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:17,440
it's the impact factor is almost like a
 

2237
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,230
it's the impact factor is almost like a
nobility title so because papers are

2238
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:20,240
nobility title so because papers are
 

2239
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,790
nobility title so because papers are
born with impact even before anyone

2240
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:22,800
born with impact even before anyone
 

2241
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,030
born with impact even before anyone
reads them so the researchers they don't

2242
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,040
reads them so the researchers they don't
 

2243
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,470
reads them so the researchers they don't
have the incentive

2244
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:26,480
have the incentive
 

2245
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,710
have the incentive
to care about if this paper is going to

2246
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:28,720
to care about if this paper is going to
 

2247
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,510
to care about if this paper is going to
ever a long-term impact on on on the

2248
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:31,520
ever a long-term impact on on on the
 

2249
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,990
ever a long-term impact on on on the
world what they care their goal their

2250
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:34,000

yes so that they get that value up front

2254
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:39,040
yes so that they get that value up front
 

2255
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,630
yes so that they get that value up front
and so for me that that is one of the

2256
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:40,640
and so for me that that is one of the
 

2257
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,790
and so for me that that is one of the
problems of of that and that really

2258
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:42,800
problems of of that and that really
 

2259
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,750
problems of of that and that really
creates a tyranny of of metrics

2260
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:45,760
creates a tyranny of of metrics
 

2261
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,190
creates a tyranny of of metrics
because at the end of the day if you are

2262
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:47,200
because at the end of the day if you are
 

2263
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,349

on journals with high impact factors
 

2269
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,309
on journals with high impact factors
because that will increase the ranking

2270
00:40:56,309 --> 00:40:56,319
because that will increase the ranking
 

2271
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,069
because that will increase the ranking
of your university and will allow you to

2272
00:40:58,069 --> 00:40:58,079
of your university and will allow you to
 

2273
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,710
of your university and will allow you to
charge more for tuition so on and so

charge more for tuition so on and so
 

2275
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,390

competitive areas you know that people
 

2281
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,309
competitive areas you know that people
will try to gamify that system and and

2282
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:10,319
will try to gamify that system and and

00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:30,160
science negatively and it's interesting
 

2299
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,349
science negatively and it's interesting
to think especially in terms of

2300
00:41:31,349 --> 00:41:31,359
to think especially in terms of
 

2301
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:34,150
to think especially in terms of
citations if you look at the early work

2302

citations if you look at the early work
 

2303
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,550
citations if you look at the early work
of like looking at citations there was a

2304
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:36,560
of like looking at citations there was a
 

2305
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,990
of like looking at citations there was a
lot of work that was done by a guy

2306
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:38,000
lot of work that was done by a guy
 

2307
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,950
lot of work that was done by a guy
called eugene garfield and this guy

the early work in terms of citation they

2310
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:42,560
the early work in terms of citation they
 

2311
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,910
the early work in terms of citation they
wanted to use they wanted to use

2312
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:43,920
wanted to use they wanted to use
 

2313
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,510
wanted to use they wanted to use
citations as

2314
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:45,520
citations as
 

2315
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,990
citations as
from a descriptive point of view so what

2316
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,000
from a descriptive point of view so what
 

2317
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,790
from a descriptive point of view so what
they wanted to to create was a map

2318
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:50,800
they wanted to to create was a map
 

2319
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,950
they wanted to to create was a map
and and that map would create a visual

2320
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:52,960
and and that map would create a visual
 

2321
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,510
and and that map would create a visual
representation of of influence so

2322
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:55,520
representation of of influence so
 

2323
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,430
representation of of influence so
citations would be links

2324
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:57,440
citations would be links
 

2325
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,990
citations would be links
between papers and the ideally what they

2326
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:00,000
between papers and the ideally what they
 

2327
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,230
between papers and the ideally what they
would show they would represent is that

2328
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:02,240
would show they would represent is that
 

2329
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,710
would show they would represent is that
you read someone else's paper and it had

2330
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:04,720
you read someone else's paper and it had
 

2331
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,710
you read someone else's paper and it had
an impact on your research they weren't

supposed to be counted i think this

2334
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:08,880
supposed to be counted i think this
 

2335
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,349
supposed to be counted i think this
inspired like larry and sergey's exactly

00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,950
worked right for google exactly i think
they even mentioned that but what

2340

they even mentioned that but what
 

2341
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,710
they even mentioned that but what
happens is like as you start counting

2342
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:16,720
happens is like as you start counting

00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:21,760
and and the same way like and this was
 

2347
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,990
and and the same way like and this was

the the work of eugene garfield was a
 

2349
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,069
the the work of eugene garfield was a
big inspiration for larry and sergey for

2350
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:26,079
big inspiration for larry and sergey for

2353
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,190
the pagerank algorithm that um you know
led to the creation of google and they

led to the creation of google and they
 

2355
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,349
led to the creation of google and they
even recognize that and and if you think

2356
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:33,359
even recognize that and and if you think
 

2357
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,589
even recognize that and and if you think
about it's like the same way there's a

2358
00:42:35,589 --> 00:42:35,599
about it's like the same way there's a
 

2359

you know the universities that are maybe

2408
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:32,960
you know the universities that are maybe
 

2409
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,069
you know the universities that are maybe
less prestigious less known that where

2410
00:43:36,069 --> 00:43:36,079
less prestigious less known that where
 

2411
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,470
less prestigious less known that where
the faculty are pressured to just

2412
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:38,480
the faculty are pressured to just
 

2413
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,550
the faculty are pressured to just
publish papers regardless of the journal

2414
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:40,560
publish papers regardless of the journal
 

2415
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,150
publish papers regardless of the journal
what i want to do is increase the

2416
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:42,160
what i want to do is increase the
 

2417
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,790
what i want to do is increase the
ranking of my university and so they end

2418
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:44,800
ranking of my university and so they end
 

2419
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,950
ranking of my university and so they end
up publishing as many papers as as they

2420
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:46,960
up publishing as many papers as as they
 

2421
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,870
up publishing as many papers as as they
they can in like journals with low

2422
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:48,880
they can in like journals with low
 

2423
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,910
they can in like journals with low
impact factor and unfortunately this is

2424
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:51,920
impact factor and unfortunately this is
 

2425
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,430
impact factor and unfortunately this is
represents a lot of of the global south

2426
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:55,440
represents a lot of of the global south
 

2427
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,910
represents a lot of of the global south
and then you have the luxury good

2428
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:57,920
and then you have the luxury good
 

2429
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,430
and then you have the luxury good
economy

2430
00:43:59,430 --> 00:43:59,440
economy
 

2431
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,670
economy
so for instance for and there are also

2432
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:01,680
so for instance for and there are also
 

2433
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,349
so for instance for and there are also
problems here in the luxury good economy

2434
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:03,359
problems here in the luxury good economy
 

2435
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:04,710
problems here in the luxury good economy
so if you look at the journal like

2436
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:04,720
so if you look at the journal like
 

2437
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,589
so if you look at the journal like
nature

2438
00:44:05,589 --> 00:44:05,599
nature
 

2439
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,150
nature
so with impact factor of like in the low

2440
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:08,160
so with impact factor of like in the low
 

2441
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,589
so with impact factor of like in the low
40s

2442
00:44:09,589 --> 00:44:09,599
40s
 

2443
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,589
40s
there's no way that you're going to be

2444
00:44:11,589 --> 00:44:11,599
there's no way that you're going to be
 

2445
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,069
there's no way that you're going to be
able to sustain that level of impact

2446
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:14,079
able to sustain that level of impact
 

2447
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,630
able to sustain that level of impact
factor by just grabbing the attention of

2448
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:16,640
factor by just grabbing the attention of
 

2449
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,910
factor by just grabbing the attention of
scientists

2450
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:17,920
scientists
 

2451
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,470
scientists
what what i mean by that is like

2452
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:20,480
what what i mean by that is like
 

2453
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,870
what what i mean by that is like
for for the journals the articles that

2454
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:22,880
for for the journals the articles that
 

2455
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,950
for for the journals the articles that
get published in nature they need to be

2456
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:26,960
get published in nature they need to be
 

2457
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,270
get published in nature they need to be
new york times great so they need to

2458
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:29,280
new york times great so they need to
 

2459
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,109
new york times great so they need to
make it to the you know to the to the

2460
00:44:31,109 --> 00:44:31,119
make it to the you know to the to the
 

2461
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:32,550
make it to the you know to the to the
big media they need to be captured by

2462
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:32,560
big media they need to be captured by
 

2463
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,470
big media they need to be captured by
the big media and because that's the

2464
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:34,480
the big media and because that's the
 

2465
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,990
the big media and because that's the
only way for you to capture enough

2466
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:36,000
only way for you to capture enough
 

2467
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,790
only way for you to capture enough
attention to sustain that level of

2468
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:38,800
attention to sustain that level of
 

2469
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,349
attention to sustain that level of
citations yes and that of course creates

2470
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:41,359
citations yes and that of course creates
 

2471
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,230
citations yes and that of course creates
problems because people then will try to

2472
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:44,240
problems because people then will try to
 

2473
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,630
problems because people then will try to
again gamify the system and have like

2474
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:46,640
again gamify the system and have like
 

2475
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,589
again gamify the system and have like
titles or abstracts or that are

2476
00:44:49,589 --> 00:44:49,599
titles or abstracts or that are
 

2477
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:52,630
titles or abstracts or that are
bigger claim make claims that are bigger

2478
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:52,640
bigger claim make claims that are bigger
 

2479
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,430
bigger claim make claims that are bigger
than what is actually can be um

2480
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:55,440
than what is actually can be um
 

2481
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,430
than what is actually can be um
you know sustained by by the data or the

2482
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:57,440
you know sustained by by the data or the
 

2483
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,430
you know sustained by by the data or the
the content of the paper and you'll have

2484
00:44:59,430 --> 00:44:59,440
the content of the paper and you'll have
 

2485
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,550
the content of the paper and you'll have
clickbait titles or clickbait abstracts

2486
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:02,560
clickbait titles or clickbait abstracts
 

2487
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,270
clickbait titles or clickbait abstracts
and again this is all a consequence of

2488
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:05,280
and again this is all a consequence of
 

2489
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,470
and again this is all a consequence of
metrics and uh scientometrics and and

2490
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:08,480
metrics and uh scientometrics and and
 

2491
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,109
metrics and uh scientometrics and and
this is a very dangerous cycle that i

2492
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:11,119
this is a very dangerous cycle that i
 

2493
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,430
this is a very dangerous cycle that i
think it's very hard to break

2494
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:13,440
think it's very hard to break
 

2495
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,829
think it's very hard to break
but it's happening in academia in a lot

2496
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:15,839
but it's happening in academia in a lot
 

2497
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,349
but it's happening in academia in a lot
of fields right now

2498
00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:17,359
of fields right now
 

2499
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,190
of fields right now
is it fundamentally the existence of

2500
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:19,200
is it fundamentally the existence of
 

2501
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,109
is it fundamentally the existence of
metrics or the metrics just need to be

2502
00:45:21,109 --> 00:45:21,119
metrics or the metrics just need to be
 

2503
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,109
metrics or the metrics just need to be
significantly improved

2504
00:45:23,109 --> 00:45:23,119
significantly improved
 

2505
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:24,470
significantly improved
because uh

2506
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:24,480
because uh
 

2507
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,270
because uh
like i said the metrics used for amazon

2508
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:27,280
like i said the metrics used for amazon
 

2509
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,190
like i said the metrics used for amazon
for purchasing

2510
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:29,200
for purchasing
 

2511
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,230
for purchasing
i don't know

2512
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:30,240
i don't know
 

2513
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,630
i don't know
computer parts it's pretty damn good in

2514
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:32,640
computer parts it's pretty damn good in
 

2515
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,150
computer parts it's pretty damn good in
terms of selecting which are the good

2516
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:34,160
terms of selecting which are the good
 

2517
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,589
terms of selecting which are the good
ones which are not

2518
00:45:35,589 --> 00:45:35,599
ones which are not
 

2519
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:40,069
ones which are not
in that same way if if we had an amazon

2520
00:45:40,069 --> 00:45:40,079
in that same way if if we had an amazon
 

2521
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,230
in that same way if if we had an amazon
type of review system in the space of

2522
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:42,240
type of review system in the space of
 

2523
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,309
type of review system in the space of
ideas in the space of science it feels

2524
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:44,319
ideas in the space of science it feels
 

2525
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,670
ideas in the space of science it feels
like that those metrics would be a

2526
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:45,680
like that those metrics would be a
 

2527
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,270
like that those metrics would be a
little bit better

2528
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:47,280
little bit better
 

2529
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,910
little bit better
sort of when it's um

2530
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:49,920
sort of when it's um
 

2531
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,910
sort of when it's um
when it's significantly

2532
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:51,920
when it's significantly
 

2533
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,390
when it's significantly
more open to the crowd source nature of

2534
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:54,400
more open to the crowd source nature of

00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:02,400
problem with peer review
 

2543
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,910
problem with peer review
has always been

2544
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:03,920
has always been
 

2545
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,270
has always been
that it's like

that it's like
 

2547
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,510
that it's like
five six seven people

five six seven people
 

2549
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,630
five six seven people
usually even less and it's often

00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:28,790
and also
it doesn't necessarily have to be

2570
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:28,800
it doesn't necessarily have to be
 

2571
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,750
it doesn't necessarily have to be
anonymous like there has to be um

2572
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:31,760
anonymous like there has to be um
 

2573
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,670
anonymous like there has to be um
the entire system is um

2574
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:35,680
the entire system is um
 

2575
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,069
the entire system is um
doesn't encourage actual sort of

00:46:38,069 --> 00:46:38,079
doesn't encourage actual sort of
 

2577
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,950
doesn't encourage actual sort of
rigorous review for example like

2578
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:40,960
rigorous review for example like
 

2579
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,430
rigorous review for example like
open review

2580
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:43,440
open review
 

2581
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,190
open review
does kind of incentivize that kind of

2582
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:45,200
does kind of incentivize that kind of
 

2583
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,589
does kind of incentivize that kind of
process of collaborative review but it's

2584
00:46:47,589 --> 00:46:47,599
process of collaborative review but it's
 

2585
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:50,309
process of collaborative review but it's
also imperfect it just feels like

2586
00:46:50,309 --> 00:46:50,319
also imperfect it just feels like
 

2587
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,230
also imperfect it just feels like
the thing that amazon has which is like

2593
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,069

it feels like that could be applied to

00:47:00,069 --> 00:47:00,079
it feels like that could be applied to
 

2595
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:01,829
it feels like that could be applied to

it feels like that should be possible

i agree with that i i think we there's
definitely the possibility at least for

definitely the possibility at least for

2681
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,309
more resilient a more resilient system
than what we have today and that's i

2682
00:48:42,309 --> 00:48:42,319
than what we have today and that's i
 

2683
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,270
than what we have today and that's i
think that's kind of what you're

2684
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:43,280
think that's kind of what you're
 

2685
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,589
think that's kind of what you're
describing alex and and i mean to an

00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:45,599
describing alex and and i mean to an
 

2687
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,069
describing alex and and i mean to an
extent we we kind of have like a little

2688
00:48:48,069 --> 00:48:48,079
extent we we kind of have like a little
 

2689
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:49,510
extent we we kind of have like a little
bit of a

2690
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:49,520
bit of a
 

2691
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,510
bit of a
heisenberg uncertainty principle when

2692
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:51,520
heisenberg uncertainty principle when
 

2693
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,190
heisenberg uncertainty principle when
you pick a metric as soon as you do it

2694
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:53,200
you pick a metric as soon as you do it
 

2695
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,030
you pick a metric as soon as you do it
then maybe it works as a good heuristic

2696
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:55,040
then maybe it works as a good heuristic
 

2697
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,790
then maybe it works as a good heuristic
for for a short amount of time but soon

2698
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:56,800
for for a short amount of time but soon
 

2699
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,950
for for a short amount of time but soon
enough people would start gamifying and

2700
00:48:58,950 --> 00:48:58,960
enough people would start gamifying and
 

2701
00:48:58,960 --> 00:48:59,750
enough people would start gamifying and
yeah

2702
00:48:59,750 --> 00:48:59,760
yeah
 

2703
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,589
yeah
but but then you can definitely have

2704
00:49:01,589 --> 00:49:01,599
but but then you can definitely have
 

2705
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:03,430
but but then you can definitely have
metrics that are more resilient to

2706
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:03,440
metrics that are more resilient to
 

2707
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,270
metrics that are more resilient to
gamification and they'll work as a

2708
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:05,280
gamification and they'll work as a
 

2709
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,430
gamification and they'll work as a
better heuristic to to try to push you

2710
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:07,440
better heuristic to to try to push you
 

2711
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,710
better heuristic to to try to push you
in the in

2712
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:08,720
in the in
 

2713
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,630
in the in
the best direction

2714
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:10,640
the best direction
 

2715
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:11,990
the best direction
but i guess the underlying problem

2716
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:12,000
but i guess the underlying problem
 

2717
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,390
but i guess the underlying problem
you're saying is uh there's a shortage

2718
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:14,400
you're saying is uh there's a shortage
 

2719
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,790
you're saying is uh there's a shortage
of positions in academia that's a big

2720
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:16,800
of positions in academia that's a big
 

2721
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,270
of positions in academia that's a big
problem for me yeah and and that and so

2722
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:19,280
problem for me yeah and and that and so
 

2723
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,349
problem for me yeah and and that and so
they're going to be constantly gamifying

2724
00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:21,359
they're going to be constantly gamifying
 

2725
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,030
they're going to be constantly gamifying
the metrics it's a bit of a zero-sum

2726
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:23,040
the metrics it's a bit of a zero-sum
 

2727
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,549
the metrics it's a bit of a zero-sum
it's very competitive it's what it's a

2728
00:49:24,549 --> 00:49:24,559
it's very competitive it's what it's a
 

2729
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:26,870
it's very competitive it's what it's a
very competitive field and and that's

2730
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:26,880
very competitive field and and that's
 

2731
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,589
very competitive field and and that's
what usually happens in very competitive

2732
00:49:29,589 --> 00:49:29,599
what usually happens in very competitive
 

2733
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,990
what usually happens in very competitive
fields yeah yeah

2734
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:32,000
fields yeah yeah
 

2735
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,670
fields yeah yeah
but i think some of like the peer review

2736
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:33,680
but i think some of like the peer review
 

2737
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,990
but i think some of like the peer review
problems like scale helps i think and

2738
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:36,000
problems like scale helps i think and
 

2739
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,270
problems like scale helps i think and
and it's interesting to look at like

2740
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:37,280
and it's interesting to look at like
 

2741
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,870
and it's interesting to look at like
what you're mentioning breaking it down

2742
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:38,880
what you're mentioning breaking it down
 

2743
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,270
what you're mentioning breaking it down
maybe in my smaller parts and having

2744
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:41,280
maybe in my smaller parts and having
 

2745
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,109
maybe in my smaller parts and having
more people jumping in

2746
00:49:43,109 --> 00:49:43,119
more people jumping in
 

2747
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:44,790
more people jumping in
um but

2748
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:44,800
um but
 

2749
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,430
um but
th this is definitely a problem and and

2750
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:47,440
th this is definitely a problem and and
 

2751
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,950
th this is definitely a problem and and
the peer review problem as i mentioned

2752
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:48,960
the peer review problem as i mentioned
 

2753
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:49,670
the peer review problem as i mentioned
is

2754
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:49,680
is
 

2755
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,670
is
is correlated with the problem of like

2756
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:51,680
is correlated with the problem of like
 

2757
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,069
is correlated with the problem of like
academic career progression and it's all

2758
00:49:54,069 --> 00:49:54,079
academic career progression and it's all
 

2759
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:55,910
academic career progression and it's all
intertwined and it's what that's why i

2760
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:55,920
intertwined and it's what that's why i
 

2761
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,390
intertwined and it's what that's why i
think it's so hard to to break it

2762
00:49:58,390 --> 00:49:58,400
think it's so hard to to break it
 

2763
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,710
think it's so hard to to break it
um there are like a couple of really

2764
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:00,720
um there are like a couple of really
 

2765
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,230
um there are like a couple of really
interesting things that are being done

2766
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:02,240
interesting things that are being done
 

2767
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,349
interesting things that are being done
right now there are a couple of for

2768
00:50:03,349 --> 00:50:03,359
right now there are a couple of for
 

2769
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:05,829
right now there are a couple of for
instance journals that are overlaid

2770
00:50:05,829 --> 00:50:05,839
instance journals that are overlaid
 

2771
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,589
instance journals that are overlaid
journals on top of

2772
00:50:07,589 --> 00:50:07,599
journals on top of
 

2773
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:10,710
journals on top of
platforms like archive and bioarchive

2774
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:10,720
platforms like archive and bioarchive
 

2775
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,230
platforms like archive and bioarchive
that want to remove like the more

2776
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:12,240
that want to remove like the more
 

2777
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,470
that want to remove like the more
traditional journals from the equation

2778
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:14,480
traditional journals from the equation
 

2779
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,549
traditional journals from the equation
so essentially a journal is just a

2780
00:50:16,549 --> 00:50:16,559
so essentially a journal is just a
 

2781
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:20,150
so essentially a journal is just a
collection of links to papers and and um

2782
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:20,160
collection of links to papers and and um
 

2783
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,309
collection of links to papers and and um
and what they are trying to do is like

2784
00:50:22,309 --> 00:50:22,319
and what they are trying to do is like
 

2785
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,710
and what they are trying to do is like
removing that middleman and trying to to

2786
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:24,720
removing that middleman and trying to to
 

2787
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,230
removing that middleman and trying to to
make the review process a little bit

2788
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:26,240
make the review process a little bit
 

2789
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,750
make the review process a little bit
more transparent

2790
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:27,760
more transparent
 

2791
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,549
more transparent
um

2792
00:50:28,549 --> 00:50:28,559
um
 

2793
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:31,030
um
and and and not charging universities

2794
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:31,040
and and and not charging universities
 

2795
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,710
and and and not charging universities
like uh there's there's a couple of

2796
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:32,720
like uh there's there's a couple of
 

2797
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,790
like uh there's there's a couple of
there are a couple of more famous um

2798
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:34,800
there are a couple of more famous um
 

2799
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,630
there are a couple of more famous um
ones there's one discrete analysis in

2800
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:36,640
ones there's one discrete analysis in
 

2801
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,870
ones there's one discrete analysis in
mathematics there's one uh called the

2802
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:38,880
mathematics there's one uh called the
 

2803
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,710
mathematics there's one uh called the
quantum journal which we are actually

2804
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:40,720
quantum journal which we are actually
 

2805
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,710
quantum journal which we are actually
working with them we have a partnership

2806
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:42,720
working with them we have a partnership
 

2807
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,390
working with them we have a partnership
with them for the purpose that get

2808
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:44,400
with them for the purpose that get
 

2809
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,390
with them for the purpose that get
published in quantum journal they also

2810
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:46,400
published in quantum journal they also
 

2811
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,790
published in quantum journal they also
get the annotations on formats um and

2812
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:48,800
get the annotations on formats um and
 

2813
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,069
get the annotations on formats um and
they are doing pretty well they've been

2814
00:50:50,069 --> 00:50:50,079
they are doing pretty well they've been
 

2815
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:51,990
they are doing pretty well they've been
able to grow substantially the problem

2816
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:52,000
able to grow substantially the problem
 

2817
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,750
able to grow substantially the problem
there is getting to critical mass so

2818
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:53,760
there is getting to critical mass so
 

2819
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,829
there is getting to critical mass so
it's again convincing the researchers

2820
00:50:55,829 --> 00:50:55,839
it's again convincing the researchers
 

2821
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:57,589
it's again convincing the researchers
and especially the young researchers

2822
00:50:57,589 --> 00:50:57,599
and especially the young researchers
 

2823
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:58,870
and especially the young researchers
that need

2824
00:50:58,870 --> 00:50:58,880
that need
 

2825
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,109
that need
need that impact factor need those

2826
00:51:01,109 --> 00:51:01,119
need that impact factor need those
 

2827
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:03,510
need that impact factor need those
publications to have citations to not

2828
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:03,520
publications to have citations to not
 

2829
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,670
publications to have citations to not
publish on the traditional journal and

2830
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:05,680
publish on the traditional journal and
 

2831
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,309
publish on the traditional journal and
go on an open journal and and publish

2832
00:51:08,309 --> 00:51:08,319
go on an open journal and and publish
 

2833
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,230
go on an open journal and and publish
their work there there i think there are

2834
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:10,240
their work there there i think there are
 

2835
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,230
their work there there i think there are
a couple of really high-profile

2836
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:12,240
a couple of really high-profile
 

2837
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,990
a couple of really high-profile
scientists of people like team gowers

2838
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:14,000
scientists of people like team gowers
 

2839
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,190
scientists of people like team gowers
that are trying to

2840
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:15,200
that are trying to
 

2841
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,950
that are trying to
incentivize like

2842
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:16,960
incentivize like
 

2843
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,470
incentivize like
famous scientists that already have

2844
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:18,480
famous scientists that already have
 

2845
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,950
famous scientists that already have
tenure and that don't need that to

2846
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:20,960
tenure and that don't need that to
 

2847
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,950
tenure and that don't need that to
publish that to increase the reputation

2848
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:22,960
publish that to increase the reputation
 

2849
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,270
publish that to increase the reputation
of those journals so that other maybe

2850
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:25,280
of those journals so that other maybe
 

2851
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,270
of those journals so that other maybe
younger scientists can start publishing

2852
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:27,280
younger scientists can start publishing
 

2853
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,430
younger scientists can start publishing
on on those as well and so they can try

2854
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:29,440
on on those as well and so they can try
 

2855
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,990
on on those as well and so they can try
to break that vicious cycle of

2856
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:32,000
to break that vicious cycle of
 

2857
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,109
to break that vicious cycle of
of um the more traditional journals i

2858
00:51:35,109 --> 00:51:35,119
of um the more traditional journals i
 

2859
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:37,349
of um the more traditional journals i
mean another possible way to break this

2860
00:51:37,349 --> 00:51:37,359
mean another possible way to break this
 

2861
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:38,950
mean another possible way to break this
cycle is to

2862
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:38,960
cycle is to
 

2863
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,589
cycle is to
like raise public awareness and just by

2864
00:51:41,589 --> 00:51:41,599
like raise public awareness and just by
 

2865
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,950
like raise public awareness and just by
force like ban paid journals

2866
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:44,960
force like ban paid journals
 

2867
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,030
force like ban paid journals
like what exactly are they contributing

2868
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:47,040
like what exactly are they contributing
 

2869
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,710
like what exactly are they contributing
to the world

2870
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:48,720
to the world
 

2871
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,589
to the world
like basically making it illegal

2872
00:51:51,589 --> 00:51:51,599
like basically making it illegal
 

2873
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:53,829
like basically making it illegal
to uh

2874
00:51:53,829 --> 00:51:53,839
to uh
 

2875
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,190
to uh
forget the fact that it's mostly

2876
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:55,200
forget the fact that it's mostly
 

2877
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,510
forget the fact that it's mostly
federally funded so that's that's a

2878
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:57,520
federally funded so that's that's a
 

2879
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,349
federally funded so that's that's a
super ugly picture too

2880
00:51:59,349 --> 00:51:59,359
super ugly picture too
 

2881
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,549
super ugly picture too
but like why should knowledge be

2882
00:52:02,549 --> 00:52:02,559
but like why should knowledge be
 

2883
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:04,790
but like why should knowledge be
so expensive

2884
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:04,800
so expensive
 

2885
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,630
so expensive
like where everyone is working for the

2886
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:06,640
like where everyone is working for the
 

2887
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,309
like where everyone is working for the
public good

2888
00:52:08,309 --> 00:52:08,319
public good
 

2889
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,790
public good
and then there's these gatekeepers

2890
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:10,800
and then there's these gatekeepers
 

2891
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,549
and then there's these gatekeepers
that you know most people can't read

2892
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:12,559
that you know most people can't read
 

2893
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:13,990
that you know most people can't read
most papers

2894
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:14,000
most papers
 

2895
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,829
most papers
without having to pay money and

2896
00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:16,839
without having to pay money and
 

2897
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:19,750
without having to pay money and
that's that doesn't make any sense

2898
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:19,760
that's that doesn't make any sense
 

2899
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,309
that's that doesn't make any sense
that's like that that should be illegal

2900
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:22,319
that's like that that should be illegal

because
 

2949
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:12,630
because
so the moment you dissolve the journals

2950
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:12,640
so the moment you dissolve the journals
 

2951
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,470
so the moment you dissolve the journals
then there will be an opportunity for

00:54:58,150 --> 00:54:58,160
you know like a central hub of what that
 

3057
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,789
you know like a central hub of what that
work is across the multiple versions but

3058
00:55:00,789 --> 00:55:00,799
work is across the multiple versions but
 

3059
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:03,510
work is across the multiple versions but
that almost seems like a fun

3060
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:03,520
that almost seems like a fun

they are a middle layer that is not

00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:28,640
they are a middle layer that is not
 

3085
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,390
they are a middle layer that is not
adding a lot of value and you see a lot

3086
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:30,400
adding a lot of value and you see a lot
 

3087
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,270
adding a lot of value and you see a lot
of motions whereas like in europe a lot

3088
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:33,280
of motions whereas like in europe a lot
 

3089
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,390
of motions whereas like in europe a lot
of the the

3090
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:34,400
of the the
 

3091
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,630
of the the
papers that are get

3092
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:36,640
papers that are get
 

3093
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,950

are funded by the european union they

3094
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:38,960
are funded by the european union they
 

3095
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,270
are funded by the european union they
will have to be um uh

3096
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:41,280
will have to be um uh
 

3097
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,430
will have to be um uh
open to the public and i think there's a

3098
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:43,440
open to the public and i think there's a
 

3099
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,910
open to the public and i think there's a
lot of bill gates to like the the what

3100
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:45,920
lot of bill gates to like the the what
 

3101
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,069
lot of bill gates to like the the what
the gates foundation funds like they

3102
00:55:48,069 --> 00:55:48,079
the gates foundation funds like they
 

3103
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:50,789
the gates foundation funds like they
they demand that it then it that it's uh

3104
00:55:50,789 --> 00:55:50,799
they demand that it then it that it's uh
 

3105
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:52,710
they demand that it then it that it's uh
accessible to everybody oh interesting

3106
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:52,720
accessible to everybody oh interesting
 

3107
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,309
accessible to everybody oh interesting
so i think it's it's the question of

3108
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:54,319
so i think it's it's the question of
 

3109
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:56,950
so i think it's it's the question of
time before that that wall kind of falls

3110
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:56,960
time before that that wall kind of falls
 

3111
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,710
time before that that wall kind of falls
and and that is going to open a lot of

3112
00:55:58,710 --> 00:55:58,720
and and that is going to open a lot of
 

3113
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,789
and and that is going to open a lot of
possibilities um because you know

3114
00:56:00,789 --> 00:56:00,799
possibilities um because you know
 

3115
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:03,750
possibilities um because you know
imagine if if you had like the layer of

3116
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:03,760
imagine if if you had like the layer of
 

3117
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,069
imagine if if you had like the layer of
like that gigantic layer of papers all

3118
00:56:06,069 --> 00:56:06,079
like that gigantic layer of papers all
 

3119
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:07,510
like that gigantic layer of papers all
available online

3120
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:07,520
available online
 

3121
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:10,390
available online
um you know that unlocks a lot of

3122
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:10,400
um you know that unlocks a lot of
 

3123
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,470
um you know that unlocks a lot of
potential as a platform for people to

3124
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:12,480
potential as a platform for people to
 

3125
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,309
potential as a platform for people to
build things on top of that but i think

3126
00:56:14,309 --> 00:56:14,319
build things on top of that but i think
 

3127
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:16,230
build things on top of that but i think
it's what you're saying it is weird like

3128
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:16,240
it's what you're saying it is weird like
 

3129
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,750
it's what you're saying it is weird like
you can literally

3130
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:17,760
you can literally
 

3131
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,030
you can literally
go and listen to any song that was ever

3132

go and listen to any song that was ever
 

3133
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,150
go and listen to any song that was ever
made

3134
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:22,160
made
 

3135
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,230
made
on your phone right you open spotify and

3136
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:24,240
on your phone right you open spotify and
 

3137
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,069
on your phone right you open spotify and
you might not even pay for it you might

3138
00:56:26,069 --> 00:56:26,079
you might not even pay for it you might
 

3139
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:27,430
you might not even pay for it you might
be on the free version and you can

3140
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:27,440
be on the free version and you can
 

3141
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,270
be on the free version and you can
listen to any song that has ever made

3142
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:29,280
listen to any song that has ever made
 

3143
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,470
listen to any song that has ever made
pretty much

3144
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:30,480
pretty much
 

3145
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,270
pretty much
but

3146
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:31,280
but
 

3147
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,670
but
there's like you you don't have access

3148
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:33,680
there's like you you don't have access
 

3149
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:37,349
there's like you you don't have access
to a huge percentage of academic papers

3150
00:56:37,349 --> 00:56:37,359
to a huge percentage of academic papers
 

3151
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:39,109
to a huge percentage of academic papers
which is just like this fundamental

3152
00:56:39,109 --> 00:56:39,119
which is just like this fundamental
 

3153
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:41,430
which is just like this fundamental
knowledge that we're all funding but you

3154
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:41,440
knowledge that we're all funding but you
 

3155
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,349
knowledge that we're all funding but you
as an individual don't have access to it

3156
00:56:43,349 --> 00:56:43,359
as an individual don't have access to it
 

3157
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:45,190
as an individual don't have access to it
and and somehow you know like the

3158
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:45,200
and and somehow you know like the
 

3159
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,430
and and somehow you know like the
problem for music got solved

3160
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:47,440
problem for music got solved
 

3161
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,910
problem for music got solved
uh but for papers it's still like it's

3162
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:49,920
uh but for papers it's still like it's
 

3163
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,829
uh but for papers it's still like it's
just not yet it could be ad supported

3164
00:56:51,829 --> 00:56:51,839
just not yet it could be ad supported
 

3165
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:53,430
just not yet it could be ad supported
all those kinds of things and that

3166
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:53,440
all those kinds of things and that
 

3167
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,190
all those kinds of things and that
hopefully that would change the way we

3168
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:55,200
hopefully that would change the way we
 

3169
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,030
hopefully that would change the way we
do science that's the most exciting

3170
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:57,040
do science that's the most exciting
 

3171
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,390
do science that's the most exciting
thing for me

3172
00:56:58,390 --> 00:56:58,400
thing for me
 

3173
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,549
thing for me
is uh especially once i started like

3174
00:57:00,549 --> 00:57:00,559
is uh especially once i started like
 

3175
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,390
is uh especially once i started like
making videos in this

3176
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:02,400
making videos in this
 

3177
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,710
making videos in this
silly podcast thing i started to realize

3178
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:04,720
silly podcast thing i started to realize
 

3179
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,390
silly podcast thing i started to realize
like

3180
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:06,400
like
 

3181
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,390
like
that if you want to do science one of

3182
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:08,400
that if you want to do science one of
 

3183
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,750
that if you want to do science one of
the most effective ways is to do uh like

3184
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:11,760
the most effective ways is to do uh like
 

3185
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:12,950
the most effective ways is to do uh like
couple

3186
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:12,960
couple
 

3187
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,910
couple
the paper with a set of youtube videos

3188
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:15,920
the paper with a set of youtube videos
 

3189
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,710
the paper with a set of youtube videos
like explaining it like

3190
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:18,720
like explaining it like
 

3191
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,789
like explaining it like
yeah that also seems like there's a lot

3192
00:57:20,789 --> 00:57:20,799
yeah that also seems like there's a lot
 

3193
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:22,710
yeah that also seems like there's a lot
of room for disruption there what is the

3194
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:22,720
of room for disruption there what is the
 

3195
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,510
of room for disruption there what is the
paper 2.0 gonna look like i think like

3196
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:25,520
paper 2.0 gonna look like i think like
 

3197
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,990
paper 2.0 gonna look like i think like
latex and the pdf

3198
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:28,000
latex and the pdf
 

3199
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,349
latex and the pdf
seems like if you

3200
00:57:29,349 --> 00:57:29,359
seems like if you
 

3201
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:30,789
seems like if you
it's interesting if you look at the

3202
00:57:30,789 --> 00:57:30,799
it's interesting if you look at the
 

3203
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:33,270
it's interesting if you look at the
first paper that got published in nature

3204
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:33,280
first paper that got published in nature
 

3205
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,870
first paper that got published in nature
and if you look at the paper that got

3206
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:34,880
and if you look at the paper that got
 

3207
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,710
and if you look at the paper that got
published in nature today look at the

3208
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:36,720
published in nature today look at the
 

3209
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,549
published in nature today look at the
two side by side they are fundamentally

3210
00:57:38,549 --> 00:57:38,559
two side by side they are fundamentally
 

3211
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,510
two side by side they are fundamentally
the same

3212
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:39,520
the same
 

3213
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,549
the same
and

3214
00:57:40,549 --> 00:57:40,559
and
 

3215
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:42,150
and
even though like the paper that gets

3216
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:42,160
even though like the paper that gets
 

3217
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,230
even though like the paper that gets
published today you know

3218
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:44,240
published today you know
 

3219
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,789
published today you know
you get even even code like right now

3220
00:57:46,789 --> 00:57:46,799
you get even even code like right now
 

3221
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:50,309
you get even even code like right now
people put like code like on on a pdf

3222
00:57:50,309 --> 00:57:50,319
people put like code like on on a pdf
 

3223
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:51,829
people put like code like on on a pdf
like and

3224
00:57:51,829 --> 00:57:51,839
like and
 

3225
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:53,510
like and
there are so many things that are

3226
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:53,520
there are so many things that are
 

3227
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,589
there are so many things that are
related to papers today you know you use

3228
00:57:55,589 --> 00:57:55,599
related to papers today you know you use
 

3229
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:58,150
related to papers today you know you use
you have data you have code um you might

3230
00:57:58,150 --> 00:57:58,160
you have data you have code um you might
 

3231
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,150
you have data you have code um you might
need videos to to better explain the

3232
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:00,160
need videos to to better explain the
 

3233
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:03,670
need videos to to better explain the
concepts so it's it i i think for me

3234
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:03,680
concepts so it's it i i think for me
 

3235
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,030
concepts so it's it i i think for me
it's natural that there's going to be

3236
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:05,040
it's natural that there's going to be
 

3237
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,109
it's natural that there's going to be
also an evolution there that papers are

3238
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:07,119
also an evolution there that papers are
 

3239
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:09,349
also an evolution there that papers are
not going to be just the static pdfs or

3240
00:58:09,349 --> 00:58:09,359
not going to be just the static pdfs or
 

3241
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:10,470
not going to be just the static pdfs or
latex

3242
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:10,480
latex
 

3243
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,870
latex
there's going to be a next uh next

3244
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:12,880
there's going to be a next uh next
 

3245
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,829
there's going to be a next uh next
interface so in academia a lot of things

3246
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:15,839
interface so in academia a lot of things
 

3247
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:18,150
interface so in academia a lot of things
that are judged your judge by is often

3248
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:18,160
that are judged your judge by is often
 

3249
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,390
that are judged your judge by is often
quantity not quality

3250
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:20,400
quantity not quality
 

3251
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,870
quantity not quality
i i wonder if there's a opportunity to

3252
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:22,880
i i wonder if there's a opportunity to
 

3253
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,230
i i wonder if there's a opportunity to
have like

3254
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:24,240
have like
 

3255
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,230
have like
i tend to judge people by the best work

3256
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:26,240
i tend to judge people by the best work
 

3257
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,950
i tend to judge people by the best work
they've ever done as opposed to

3258
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:28,960
they've ever done as opposed to
 

3259
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,470
they've ever done as opposed to
i wonder if there's a possibility for

3260
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:30,480
i wonder if there's a possibility for
 

3261
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,190
i wonder if there's a possibility for
that to encourage sort of um focusing on

3262
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:33,200
that to encourage sort of um focusing on
 

3263
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,789
that to encourage sort of um focusing on
the quality

3264
00:58:34,789 --> 00:58:34,799
the quality
 

3265
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:36,950
the quality
and not necessarily in paper form but

3266
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:36,960
and not necessarily in paper form but
 

3267
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,190
and not necessarily in paper form but
maybe a subset of a paper subset of idea

3268
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:39,200
maybe a subset of a paper subset of idea
 

3269
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,270
maybe a subset of a paper subset of idea
almost even a blog post or an experiment

3270
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:41,280
almost even a blog post or an experiment
 

3271
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,430
almost even a blog post or an experiment
like why does it have to be published in

3272
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:43,440
like why does it have to be published in
 

3273
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,549
like why does it have to be published in
a journal

3274
00:58:44,549 --> 00:58:44,559
a journal
 

3275
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:46,150
a journal
yeah to be

3276
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:46,160
yeah to be
 

3277
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,589
yeah to be
legitimate

3278
00:58:47,589 --> 00:58:47,599
legitimate
 

3279
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:49,190
legitimate
and and it's just interesting that he

3280
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:49,200
and and it's just interesting that he
 

3281
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,109
and and it's just interesting that he
mentioned that i also think like yeah

3282
00:58:51,109 --> 00:58:51,119
mentioned that i also think like yeah
 

3283
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:53,910
mentioned that i also think like yeah
it's why why why is that the only format

3284
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:53,920
it's why why why is that the only format
 

3285
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,069
it's why why why is that the only format
why can't a blog post or

3286
00:58:56,069 --> 00:58:56,079
why can't a blog post or
 

3287
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:58,150
why can't a blog post or
uh we were even experimenting

3288
00:58:58,150 --> 00:58:58,160
uh we were even experimenting
 

3289
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,630
uh we were even experimenting
experimenting with these a few months

3290
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:00,640
experimenting with these a few months
 

3291
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,270
experimenting with these a few months
ago or can you actually like publish

3292
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:03,280
ago or can you actually like publish
 

3293
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,390
ago or can you actually like publish
something

3294
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:04,400
something
 

3295
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,430
something
or

3296
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:05,440
or
 

3297
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,230
or
um

3298
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:06,240
um
 

3299
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:10,150
um
like a new scientific breakthrough or um

3300
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:10,160
like a new scientific breakthrough or um
 

3301
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,750
like a new scientific breakthrough or um
or something that you've discovered in

3302
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:11,760
or something that you've discovered in
 

3303
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,069
or something that you've discovered in
the form of like a set of tweets

3304
00:59:14,069 --> 00:59:14,079
the form of like a set of tweets
 

3305
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:16,390
the form of like a set of tweets
yeah the twitter thread why can't that

3306
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:16,400
yeah the twitter thread why can't that
 

3307
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,670
yeah the twitter thread why can't that
be possible

3308
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:17,680
be possible
 

3309
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,950
be possible
and um

3310
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:18,960
and um
 

3311
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,630
and um
we were expanding experimenting with

3312
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:20,640
we were expanding experimenting with
 

3313
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,150
we were expanding experimenting with
that idea uh we even um yeah we ran a

3314
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:24,160
that idea uh we even um yeah we ran a
 

3315
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,390
that idea uh we even um yeah we ran a
couple of of like some people submitted

3316
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:26,400
couple of of like some people submitted
 

3317
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,309
couple of of like some people submitted
a couple of those like i think the limit

3318
00:59:28,309 --> 00:59:28,319
a couple of those like i think the limit
 

3319
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:30,549
a couple of those like i think the limit
was three or four tweets yeah uh maybe

3320
00:59:30,549 --> 00:59:30,559
was three or four tweets yeah uh maybe
 

3321
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:32,390
was three or four tweets yeah uh maybe
it's a new way to look at a you know a

3322
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:32,400
it's a new way to look at a you know a
 

3323
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,789
it's a new way to look at a you know a
proof or something but uh i think it

3324
00:59:34,789 --> 00:59:34,799
proof or something but uh i think it
 

3325
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:36,470
proof or something but uh i think it
just serves to show that there should be

3326
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:36,480
just serves to show that there should be
 

3327
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,630
just serves to show that there should be
other ways to publish like scientific

3328
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:38,640
other ways to publish like scientific
 

3329
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,309
other ways to publish like scientific
discoveries that don't fit the paper

3330
00:59:40,309 --> 00:59:40,319
discoveries that don't fit the paper
 

3331
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:42,309
discoveries that don't fit the paper
format well

3332
00:59:42,309 --> 00:59:42,319
format well
 

3333
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:44,470
format well
but so even with the twitter

3334
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:44,480
but so even with the twitter
 

3335
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,589
but so even with the twitter
thread

3336
00:59:45,589 --> 00:59:45,599
thread
 

3337
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:46,710
thread
it would be

3338
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:46,720
it would be
 

3339
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,549
it would be
it would be nice to have some mechanism

3340
00:59:48,549 --> 00:59:48,559
it would be nice to have some mechanism
 

3341
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:50,950
it would be nice to have some mechanism
of formalizing it and making it stat

3342
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:50,960
of formalizing it and making it stat
 

3343
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:54,630
of formalizing it and making it stat
making it into an nft

3344
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:54,640

 

3345
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,510

like

3346
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:55,520
like
 

3347
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,510
like
a concrete thing that you can reference

3348
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:57,520
a concrete thing that you can reference
 

3349
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,589
a concrete thing that you can reference
is a link that's unique

3350
00:59:59,589 --> 00:59:59,599
is a link that's unique
 

3351
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:01,990
is a link that's unique
because uh i mean everything we've been

3352
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:02,000
because uh i mean everything we've been
 

3353
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,190
because uh i mean everything we've been
saying

3354
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:03,200
saying
 

3355
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,309
saying
all of that

3356
01:00:06,309 --> 01:00:06,319

 

3357
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:08,069

while being true

3358
01:00:08,069 --> 01:00:08,079
while being true
 

3359
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:10,309
while being true
it's also true that

3360
01:00:10,309 --> 01:00:10,319
it's also true that
 

3361
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:11,109
it's also true that
the

3362
01:00:11,109 --> 01:00:11,119
the
 

3363
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:13,670
the
constraints and the formalism of a paper

3364
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:13,680
constraints and the formalism of a paper
 

3365
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,470
constraints and the formalism of a paper
works well it like forces you

3366
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:16,480
works well it like forces you
 

3367
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,870
works well it like forces you
constraints forces you to narrow down

3368
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:18,880
constraints forces you to narrow down
 

3369
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,630
constraints forces you to narrow down
your thing and

3370
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:20,640
your thing and
 

3371
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,030
your thing and
and uh literally put it on paper

3372
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:23,040
and uh literally put it on paper
 

3373
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,950
and uh literally put it on paper
but you know

3374
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:24,960
but you know
 

3375
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,270
but you know
i agree uh make concrete and that's why

3376
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:29,280
i agree uh make concrete and that's why
 

3377
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,910
i agree uh make concrete and that's why
i mean it's not broken it's just could

3378
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:31,920
i mean it's not broken it's just could
 

3379
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,230
i mean it's not broken it's just could
be better and that's the main idea i

3380
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:34,240
be better and that's the main idea i
 

3381
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,549
be better and that's the main idea i
think there's something about writing

3382
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:36,559
think there's something about writing
 

3383
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:38,950
think there's something about writing
whether it's a blog post or twitter

3384
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:38,960
whether it's a blog post or twitter
 

3385
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,109
whether it's a blog post or twitter
thread or a paper

3386
01:00:41,109 --> 01:00:41,119
thread or a paper
 

3387
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:44,069
thread or a paper
that's really nice to to concretize a

3388
01:00:44,069 --> 01:00:44,079
that's really nice to to concretize a
 

3389
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:46,069
that's really nice to to concretize a
particular little

3390
01:00:46,069 --> 01:00:46,079
particular little
 

3391
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:49,510
particular little
idea that they can then be referenced by

3392
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:49,520
idea that they can then be referenced by
 

3393
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,230
idea that they can then be referenced by
other ideas then it can be built on top

3394
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:52,240
other ideas then it can be built on top
 

3395
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,950
other ideas then it can be built on top
of with other ideas

3396
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:54,960
of with other ideas
 

3397
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:58,630
of with other ideas
so uh let me ask you've read quite a few

3398
01:00:58,630 --> 01:00:58,640
so uh let me ask you've read quite a few
 

3399
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,390
so uh let me ask you've read quite a few
papers

3400
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:00,400
papers
 

3401
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,910
papers
you've uh annotated quite a few papers

3402
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:03,920
you've uh annotated quite a few papers
 

3403
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,829
you've uh annotated quite a few papers
let's talk about the process itself how

3404
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:05,839
let's talk about the process itself how
 

3405
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:09,109
let's talk about the process itself how
do you advise people read papers

3406
01:01:09,109 --> 01:01:09,119
do you advise people read papers
 

3407
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:10,630
do you advise people read papers
or maybe you want to broaden it beyond

3408
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:10,640
or maybe you want to broaden it beyond
 

3409
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,309
or maybe you want to broaden it beyond
just papers but just

3410
01:01:12,309 --> 01:01:12,319
just papers but just
 

3411
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,349
just papers but just
read

3412
01:01:13,349 --> 01:01:13,359
read
 

3413
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:15,030
read
concrete pieces of information to

3414
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:15,040
concrete pieces of information to
 

3415
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,150
concrete pieces of information to
understand the insights that lay within

3416
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:18,160
understand the insights that lay within
 

3417
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,069
understand the insights that lay within
i would say for paper specifically i

3418
01:01:20,069 --> 01:01:20,079
i would say for paper specifically i
 

3419
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:21,589
i would say for paper specifically i
would i would bring back kind of what

3420
01:01:21,589 --> 01:01:21,599
would i would bring back kind of what
 

3421
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:23,510
would i would bring back kind of what
louise was talking about it is that it's

3422
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:23,520
louise was talking about it is that it's
 

3423
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,750
louise was talking about it is that it's
important to keep in mind that papers

3424
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:25,760
important to keep in mind that papers
 

3425
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,870
important to keep in mind that papers
are not optimized for ease of

3426
01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:28,880
are not optimized for ease of
 

3427
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,589
are not optimized for ease of
understanding and so right there's all

3428
01:01:31,589 --> 01:01:31,599
understanding and so right there's all
 

3429
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:33,910
understanding and so right there's all
sorts of restrictions in size

3430
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:33,920
sorts of restrictions in size
 

3431
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,230
sorts of restrictions in size
and format and and language that they

3432
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:36,240
and format and and language that they
 

3433
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,470
and format and and language that they
can use and so it's important to keep

3434
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:38,480
can use and so it's important to keep
 

3435
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,230
can use and so it's important to keep
that in mind and so that if you're

3436
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:40,240
that in mind and so that if you're
 

3437
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:43,190
that in mind and so that if you're
struggling to read a paper doesn't

3438
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:43,200
struggling to read a paper doesn't
 

3439
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,270
struggling to read a paper doesn't
that might not mean that the underlying

3440
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:45,280
that might not mean that the underlying
 

3441
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,349
that might not mean that the underlying
material is actually that hard

3442
01:01:47,349 --> 01:01:47,359
material is actually that hard
 

3443
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:48,710
material is actually that hard
and so

3444
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:48,720
and so
 

3445
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,950
and so
so that's definitely something that that

3446
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:50,960
so that's definitely something that that
 

3447
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,589
so that's definitely something that that
especially for us that we we read papers

3448
01:01:53,589 --> 01:01:53,599
especially for us that we we read papers
 

3449
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:55,349
especially for us that we we read papers
and most of the times the lead papers

3450
01:01:55,349 --> 01:01:55,359
and most of the times the lead papers
 

3451
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:57,510
and most of the times the lead papers
are completely outside of our

3452
01:01:57,510 --> 01:01:57,520
are completely outside of our
 

3453
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,309
are completely outside of our
of our comfort zone i guess and and to

3454
01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:00,319
of our comfort zone i guess and and to
 

3455
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:03,109
of our comfort zone i guess and and to
be completely new areas to us um

3456
01:02:03,109 --> 01:02:03,119
be completely new areas to us um
 

3457
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,349
be completely new areas to us um
so i always try to to keep that in mind

3458
01:02:05,349 --> 01:02:05,359
so i always try to to keep that in mind
 

3459
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:06,630
so i always try to to keep that in mind
so there's usually a certain kind of

3460
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:06,640
so there's usually a certain kind of
 

3461
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,109
so there's usually a certain kind of
structure like abstract introductions

3462
01:02:09,109 --> 01:02:09,119
structure like abstract introductions
 

3463
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:11,270
structure like abstract introductions
methodology

3464
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:11,280
methodology
 

3465
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,670
methodology
uh depending on the community and so on

3466
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:13,680
uh depending on the community and so on
 

3467
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,670
uh depending on the community and so on
is there something about

3468
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:15,680
is there something about
 

3469
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,069
is there something about
the process of like how to read it

3470
01:02:18,069 --> 01:02:18,079
the process of like how to read it
 

3471
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:20,390
the process of like how to read it
whether you want to skim it to try to

3472
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:20,400
whether you want to skim it to try to
 

3473
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,670
whether you want to skim it to try to
find the parts that are easy to

3474
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:21,680
find the parts that are easy to
 

3475
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,109
find the parts that are easy to
understand or not

3476
01:02:23,109 --> 01:02:23,119
understand or not
 

3477
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:26,230
understand or not
uh reading it multiple times

3478
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:26,240
uh reading it multiple times
 

3479
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,150
uh reading it multiple times
is there any kind of hacks that you can

3480
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:28,160
is there any kind of hacks that you can
 

3481
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:30,789
is there any kind of hacks that you can
comment on i remember like feynman had

3482
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:30,799
comment on i remember like feynman had
 

3483
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:32,789
comment on i remember like feynman had
this this kind of hack when it was

3484
01:02:32,789 --> 01:02:32,799
this this kind of hack when it was
 

3485
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:34,549
this this kind of hack when it was
reading papers where

3486
01:02:34,549 --> 01:02:34,559
reading papers where
 

3487
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:36,230
reading papers where
he would basically

3488
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:36,240
he would basically
 

3489
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,510
he would basically
um

3490
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:37,520
um
 

3491
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,510
um
would i think i believe he would read

3492
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:39,520
would i think i believe he would read
 

3493
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,430
would i think i believe he would read
the conclusion of the paper

3494
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:41,440
the conclusion of the paper
 

3495
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,870
the conclusion of the paper
and we would try to just um see if he

3496
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:44,880
and we would try to just um see if he
 

3497
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:47,109
and we would try to just um see if he
would be able to figure out how to get

3498
01:02:47,109 --> 01:02:47,119
would be able to figure out how to get
 

3499
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:49,109
would be able to figure out how to get
to the conclusion in like a couple of

3500
01:02:49,109 --> 01:02:49,119
to the conclusion in like a couple of
 

3501
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:51,109
to the conclusion in like a couple of
minutes by himself

3502
01:02:51,109 --> 01:02:51,119
minutes by himself
 

3503
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:53,829
minutes by himself
and um and he would read a lot of papers

3504
01:02:53,829 --> 01:02:53,839
and um and he would read a lot of papers
 

3505
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:57,270
and um and he would read a lot of papers
that way and i think fermi also did that

3506
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:57,280
that way and i think fermi also did that
 

3507
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,270
that way and i think fermi also did that
almost and fermi was known for doing a

3508
01:02:59,270 --> 01:02:59,280
almost and fermi was known for doing a
 

3509
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,870
almost and fermi was known for doing a
lot of back of the envelope calculation

3510
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:00,880
lot of back of the envelope calculation
 

3511
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:05,029
lot of back of the envelope calculation
so he was a master at doing that um

3512
01:03:05,029 --> 01:03:05,039
so he was a master at doing that um
 

3513
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:07,430
so he was a master at doing that um
in terms of like especially when

3514
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:07,440
in terms of like especially when
 

3515
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,670
in terms of like especially when
when reading a paper i think a lot of

3516
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:09,680
when reading a paper i think a lot of
 

3517
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,430
when reading a paper i think a lot of
times people might

3518
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:11,440
times people might
 

3519
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,589
times people might
feel discouraged about the first time

3520
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:13,599
feel discouraged about the first time
 

3521
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:14,950
feel discouraged about the first time
you read it

3522
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:14,960
you read it
 

3523
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,270
you read it
you know it's very hard to grasp or you

3524
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:17,280
you know it's very hard to grasp or you
 

3525
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,349
you know it's very hard to grasp or you
don't understand a huge fraction of the

3526
01:03:19,349 --> 01:03:19,359
don't understand a huge fraction of the
 

3527
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:20,309
don't understand a huge fraction of the
paper

3528
01:03:20,309 --> 01:03:20,319
paper
 

3529
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,150
paper
and i think it's having read a lot of

3530
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:22,160
and i think it's having read a lot of
 

3531
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,109
and i think it's having read a lot of
papers in my life i think i've in peace

3532
01:03:25,109 --> 01:03:25,119
papers in my life i think i've in peace
 

3533
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:27,349
papers in my life i think i've in peace
with like the fact that you might spend

3534
01:03:27,349 --> 01:03:27,359
with like the fact that you might spend
 

3535
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:29,349
with like the fact that you might spend
hours where you're just reading a paper

3536
01:03:29,349 --> 01:03:29,359
hours where you're just reading a paper
 

3537
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:31,510
hours where you're just reading a paper
and jumping from paper to paper reading

3538
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:31,520
and jumping from paper to paper reading
 

3539
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:32,789
and jumping from paper to paper reading
citations

3540
01:03:32,789 --> 01:03:32,799
citations
 

3541
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:36,069
citations
and um like your level of understanding

3542
01:03:36,069 --> 01:03:36,079
and um like your level of understanding
 

3543
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:37,910
and um like your level of understanding
of sometimes of the paper is very close

3544
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:37,920
of sometimes of the paper is very close
 

3545
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,710
of sometimes of the paper is very close
to zero percent and all of a sudden you

3546
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:40,720
to zero percent and all of a sudden you
 

3547
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,390
to zero percent and all of a sudden you
know everything kind of

3548
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:42,400
know everything kind of
 

3549
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,789
know everything kind of
makes sense and and in your mind and

3550
01:03:44,789 --> 01:03:44,799
makes sense and and in your mind and
 

3551
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:47,349
makes sense and and in your mind and
then you know you have this quantum jump

3552
01:03:47,349 --> 01:03:47,359
then you know you have this quantum jump
 

3553
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:49,750
then you know you have this quantum jump
where all of a sudden you you you

3554
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:49,760
where all of a sudden you you you
 

3555
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,589
where all of a sudden you you you
understanding the big picture of the

3556
01:03:51,589 --> 01:03:51,599
understanding the big picture of the
 

3557
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:54,390
understanding the big picture of the
paper and uh i i

3558
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:54,400
paper and uh i i
 

3559
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,150
paper and uh i i
and and this is an exercise that i have

3560
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:56,160
and and this is an exercise that i have
 

3561
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,910
and and this is an exercise that i have
to when reading papers and especially

3562
01:03:57,910 --> 01:03:57,920
to when reading papers and especially
 

3563
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,150
to when reading papers and especially
like more complex papers like okay you

3564
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:00,160
like more complex papers like okay you
 

3565
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,430
like more complex papers like okay you
don't understand because you're just

3566
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:01,440
don't understand because you're just
 

3567
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:02,950
don't understand because you're just
going through the process and just keep

3568
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:02,960
going through the process and just keep
 

3569
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,109
going through the process and just keep
going and like and it

3570
01:04:05,109 --> 01:04:05,119
going and like and it
 

3571
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,710
going and like and it
might feel super chaotic especially if

3572
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:06,720
might feel super chaotic especially if
 

3573
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:07,990
might feel super chaotic especially if
you are jumping from reference to

3574
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:08,000
you are jumping from reference to
 

3575
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,150
you are jumping from reference to
reference you know you might end up with

3576
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:10,160
reference you know you might end up with
 

3577
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,470
reference you know you might end up with
like 20 tabs open and you're reading a

3578
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:12,480
like 20 tabs open and you're reading a
 

3579
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:13,910
like 20 tabs open and you're reading a
ton of other papers but it's just

3580
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:13,920
ton of other papers but it's just
 

3581
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,910
ton of other papers but it's just
trusting that process

3582
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:15,920
trusting that process
 

3583
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,950
trusting that process
that at the end like you'll find light

3584
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:18,960
that at the end like you'll find light
 

3585
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,710
that at the end like you'll find light
and i think for me that's a good

3586
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:20,720
and i think for me that's a good
 

3587
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:21,829
and i think for me that's a good
framework

3588
01:04:21,829 --> 01:04:21,839
framework
 

3589
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:24,390
framework
when reading a paper it's hard

3590
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:24,400
when reading a paper it's hard
 

3591
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,910
when reading a paper it's hard
because you know you might end up

3592
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:25,920
because you know you might end up
 

3593
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,750
because you know you might end up
spending a lot of time and you it looks

3594
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:27,760
spending a lot of time and you it looks
 

3595
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,190
spending a lot of time and you it looks
like you're lost

3596
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:29,200
like you're lost
 

3597
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,710
like you're lost
but uh but

3598
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:30,720
but uh but
 

3599
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,789
but uh but
that's the process to actually um you

3600
01:04:32,789 --> 01:04:32,799
that's the process to actually um you
 

3601
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:34,950
that's the process to actually um you
know understand what they're talking

3602
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:34,960
know understand what they're talking
 

3603
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,230
know understand what they're talking
about in the paper

3604
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:36,240
about in the paper
 

3605
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,069
about in the paper
yeah i think that process

3606
01:04:38,069 --> 01:04:38,079
yeah i think that process
 

3607
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:40,069
yeah i think that process
i enjoy i've found a lot of value in the

3608
01:04:40,069 --> 01:04:40,079
i enjoy i've found a lot of value in the
 

3609
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:42,950
i enjoy i've found a lot of value in the
process especially for things outside my

3610
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:42,960
process especially for things outside my
 

3611
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:43,990
process especially for things outside my
field

3612
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:44,000
field
 

3613
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,589
field
of reading a lot of related work

3614
01:04:45,589 --> 01:04:45,599
of reading a lot of related work
 

3615
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:48,950
of reading a lot of related work
sections and kind of go going down that

3616
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:48,960
sections and kind of go going down that
 

3617
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,870
sections and kind of go going down that
path of getting a big context of the

3618
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:50,880
path of getting a big context of the
 

3619
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:51,990
path of getting a big context of the
field because

3620
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:52,000
field because
 

3621
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,589
field because
what's especially when they're well

3622
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:53,599
what's especially when they're well
 

3623
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:54,789
what's especially when they're well
written

3624
01:04:54,789 --> 01:04:54,799
written
 

3625
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:57,190
written
there's opinions injected into the

3626
01:04:57,190 --> 01:04:57,200
there's opinions injected into the
 

3627
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,109
there's opinions injected into the
related work like what work is important

3628
01:04:59,109 --> 01:04:59,119
related work like what work is important
 

3629
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:01,430
related work like what work is important
what is not and if you read multiple

3630
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:01,440
what is not and if you read multiple
 

3631
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,829
what is not and if you read multiple
related work sections that cite or don't

3632
01:05:03,829 --> 01:05:03,839
related work sections that cite or don't
 

3633
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:06,549
related work sections that cite or don't
cite each other like the papers

3634
01:05:06,549 --> 01:05:06,559
cite each other like the papers
 

3635
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,710
cite each other like the papers
you get a sense of where the field where

3636
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:08,720
you get a sense of where the field where
 

3637
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,029
you get a sense of where the field where
the tensions of the field are

3638
01:05:11,029 --> 01:05:11,039
the tensions of the field are
 

3639
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:13,750
the tensions of the field are
where this where the field is striving

3640
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:13,760
where this where the field is striving
 

3641
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,990
where this where the field is striving
and that helps you put into context like

3642
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:16,000
and that helps you put into context like
 

3643
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,630
and that helps you put into context like
whether the work is radical whether it's

3644
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:18,640
whether the work is radical whether it's
 

3645
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:21,109
whether the work is radical whether it's
overselling it itself whether it's

3646
01:05:21,109 --> 01:05:21,119
overselling it itself whether it's
 

3647
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:23,349
overselling it itself whether it's
underselling itself all those things

3648
01:05:23,349 --> 01:05:23,359
underselling itself all those things
 

3649
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:26,549
underselling itself all those things
uh and on adding on top of that

3650
01:05:26,549 --> 01:05:26,559
uh and on adding on top of that
 

3651
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:28,390
uh and on adding on top of that
i find that often the related work

3652
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:28,400
i find that often the related work
 

3653
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,510

3659
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:37,190

3687
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,309
much better but other than that when
you're just painting where the where the

3688

you're just painting where the where the
 

3689
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:05,510
you're just painting where the where the

came from or where the field stands
 

3693
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:10,230
came from or where the field stands
that's really valuable and also again

3694
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:10,240
that's really valuable and also again
 

3695

3846
01:08:45,110 --> 01:08:45,120
like you are the one that progressed
 

3847
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,110
like you are the one that progressed
from one to ten and you know which steps

3848
01:08:47,110 --> 01:08:47,120
from one to ten and you know which steps
 

3849
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,349
from one to ten and you know which steps
you struggled with so you're the really

3850
01:08:49,349 --> 01:08:49,359
you struggled with so you're the really
 

3851
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:51,269
you struggled with so you're the really
the best person to help yourself make

3852
01:08:51,269 --> 01:08:51,279
the best person to help yourself make
 

3853
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:53,669
the best person to help yourself make
that transition from one to ten

3854
01:08:53,669 --> 01:08:53,679
that transition from one to ten
 

3855
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:56,550
that transition from one to ten
and um a lot of the times like

3856
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:56,560
and um a lot of the times like
 

3857
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,709
and um a lot of the times like
and we don't i really believe that the

3858
01:08:58,709 --> 01:08:58,719
and we don't i really believe that the
 

3859
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:00,789
and we don't i really believe that the
framework there we have to like just

3860
01:09:00,789 --> 01:09:00,799
framework there we have to like just
 

3861
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:03,590
framework there we have to like just
expose ourselves to like be talking to

3862
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:03,600
expose ourselves to like be talking to
 

3863
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,510
expose ourselves to like be talking to
like us when we were an expert when we

3864
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:05,520
like us when we were an expert when we
 

3865
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,110
like us when we were an expert when we
were taking that class and we knew

3866
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:07,120
were taking that class and we knew
 

3867
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,269
were taking that class and we knew
everything about quantum mechanics and

3868
01:09:09,269 --> 01:09:09,279
everything about quantum mechanics and
 

3869
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:10,870
everything about quantum mechanics and
then six months later you don't remember

3870
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:10,880
then six months later you don't remember
 

3871
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,669
then six months later you don't remember
half of the things how could we make it

3872
01:09:13,669 --> 01:09:13,679
half of the things how could we make it
 

3873
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:15,749
half of the things how could we make it
easier for a like to

3874
01:09:15,749 --> 01:09:15,759
easier for a like to
 

3875
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:17,590
easier for a like to
have those conversations between you and

3876
01:09:17,590 --> 01:09:17,600
have those conversations between you and
 

3877
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,470
have those conversations between you and
your past self past expert self

3878
01:09:20,470 --> 01:09:20,480
your past self past expert self
 

3879
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:21,349
your past self past expert self
um

3880
01:09:21,349 --> 01:09:21,359
um
 

3881
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:23,349
um
i i think there there might be you know

3882
01:09:23,349 --> 01:09:23,359
i i think there there might be you know
 

3883
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:25,669
i i think there there might be you know
it's an underexplored idea i think notes

3884
01:09:25,669 --> 01:09:25,679
it's an underexplored idea i think notes
 

3885
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:27,829
it's an underexplored idea i think notes
on paper are probably not the best way

3886
01:09:27,829 --> 01:09:27,839
on paper are probably not the best way
 

3887
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:29,349
on paper are probably not the best way
i'm not sure if it's a combination of

3888
01:09:29,349 --> 01:09:29,359
i'm not sure if it's a combination of
 

3889
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:31,349
i'm not sure if it's a combination of
like video

3890
01:09:31,349 --> 01:09:31,359
like video
 

3891
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:33,749
like video
audio where it's like you have a guided

3892
01:09:33,749 --> 01:09:33,759
audio where it's like you have a guided
 

3893
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:35,910
audio where it's like you have a guided
framework that you follow to extract

3894
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:35,920
framework that you follow to extract
 

3895
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,829
framework that you follow to extract
information from yourself so that you

3896
01:09:37,829 --> 01:09:37,839
information from yourself so that you
 

3897
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:39,990
information from yourself so that you
can later kind of revisit

3898
01:09:39,990 --> 01:09:40,000
can later kind of revisit
 

3899
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,510
can later kind of revisit
to make it easier to to remember but

3900
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:43,520
to make it easier to to remember but
 

3901
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:46,229
to make it easier to to remember but
that's i think it's an interesting idea

3902
01:09:46,229 --> 01:09:46,239
that's i think it's an interesting idea
 

3903
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:48,789
that's i think it's an interesting idea
worth worth exploring that not i've i

3904
01:09:48,789 --> 01:09:48,799
worth worth exploring that not i've i
 

3905
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:50,630
worth worth exploring that not i've i
haven't seen a lot of people kind of

3906
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:50,640
haven't seen a lot of people kind of
 

3907
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,829
haven't seen a lot of people kind of
trying to

3908
01:09:51,829 --> 01:09:51,839
trying to
 

3909
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:53,910
trying to
uh distill that problem

3910
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:53,920
uh distill that problem
 

3911
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,510
uh distill that problem
you know i'm creating the kind of tools

3912
01:09:55,510 --> 01:09:55,520
you know i'm creating the kind of tools
 

3913
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:58,229
you know i'm creating the kind of tools
i find if i record it it sounds weird

3914
01:09:58,229 --> 01:09:58,239
i find if i record it it sounds weird
 

3915
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:01,189
i find if i record it it sounds weird
but i'll take notes but if i record

3916
01:10:01,189 --> 01:10:01,199
but i'll take notes but if i record
 

3917
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:02,470
but i'll take notes but if i record
audio

3918
01:10:02,470 --> 01:10:02,480
audio
 

3919
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,510
audio
like um like little clips of thoughts

3920
01:10:05,510 --> 01:10:05,520
like um like little clips of thoughts
 

3921
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:08,070
like um like little clips of thoughts
like rants

3922
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:08,080
like rants
 

3923
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,149
like rants
that's really effective at capturing

3924
01:10:10,149 --> 01:10:10,159
that's really effective at capturing
 

3925
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:12,470
that's really effective at capturing
something that notes can't

3926
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:12,480
something that notes can't
 

3927
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:14,630
something that notes can't
because when i replay them for some

3928
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:14,640
because when i replay them for some
 

3929
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:15,590
because when i replay them for some
reason

3930
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:15,600
reason
 

3931
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,390
reason
it loads my brain back into where i was

3932
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:18,400
it loads my brain back into where i was
 

3933
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,390
it loads my brain back into where i was
when i was reading that in a way that

3934
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:20,400
when i was reading that in a way that
 

3935
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:23,830
when i was reading that in a way that
notes don't like when i read notes i'll

3936
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:23,840
notes don't like when i read notes i'll
 

3937
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,630
notes don't like when i read notes i'll
often be like what what

3938
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:26,640
often be like what what
 

3939
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,470
often be like what what
what was i what was i thinking there but

3940
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:28,480
what was i what was i thinking there but
 

3941
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,790
what was i what was i thinking there but
when i listened to the audio yeah it

3942
01:10:30,790 --> 01:10:30,800
when i listened to the audio yeah it
 

3943
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,390
when i listened to the audio yeah it
brings you right back to that place so

3944
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:32,400
brings you right back to that place so
 

3945
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:33,669
brings you right back to that place so
there might and

3946
01:10:33,669 --> 01:10:33,679
there might and
 

3947
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:35,590
there might and
maybe with video with visual that might

3948
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:35,600
maybe with video with visual that might
 

3949
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,070
maybe with video with visual that might
be even more powerful i think so yeah

3950
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:38,080
be even more powerful i think so yeah
 

3951
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,390
be even more powerful i think so yeah
and and i think just the process of

3952
01:10:40,390 --> 01:10:40,400
and and i think just the process of
 

3953
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,790
and and i think just the process of
you know verbalizing it

3954
01:10:42,790 --> 01:10:42,800
you know verbalizing it
 

3955
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,030
you know verbalizing it
that alone kind of makes you have to

3956
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:45,040
that alone kind of makes you have to
 

3957
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,270
that alone kind of makes you have to
structure your thought and and put it in

3958
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:47,280
structure your thought and and put it in
 

3959
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,669
structure your thought and and put it in
a way that somebody else could come and

3960
01:10:49,669 --> 01:10:49,679
a way that somebody else could come and
 

3961
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:51,750
a way that somebody else could come and
understand it and and just the process

3962
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:51,760
understand it and and just the process
 

3963
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,390
understand it and and just the process
of that is useful to to organize your

3964
01:10:54,390 --> 01:10:54,400
of that is useful to to organize your
 

3965
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,750
of that is useful to to organize your
thoughts and and

3966
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:55,760
thoughts and and
 

3967
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,550
thoughts and and
and um yeah just just that alone does

3968
01:10:58,550 --> 01:10:58,560
and um yeah just just that alone does
 

3969
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,709
and um yeah just just that alone does

top of it to explain the paper because
 

3981
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,030

you're doing all the hard work of
 

3983
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:16,070
you're doing all the hard work of

understanding deeply the paper
 

3985
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,310
understanding deeply the paper
not we haven't seen that happening too

3986
01:11:18,310 --> 01:11:18,320
not we haven't seen that happening too
 

3987
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,870
not we haven't seen that happening too
much but uh we were we were actually

much but uh we were we were actually
 

3989
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,950
much but uh we were we were actually
playing around with the idea of creating

3990
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:22,960
playing around with the idea of creating
 

3991
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,110
playing around with the idea of creating
some sort of podcast version where we

3992
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:25,120
some sort of podcast version where we
 

3993
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,510
some sort of podcast version where we
try to distill the paper

3994
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:27,520
try to distill the paper
 

3995
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,910
try to distill the paper
on an audio format that not maybe you

3996
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:29,920
on an audio format that not maybe you
 

3997
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,270
on an audio format that not maybe you
could have access

3998
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:31,280
could have access
 

3999
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:32,950
could have access
might be trickier but you there's

4000
01:11:32,950 --> 01:11:32,960
might be trickier but you there's
 

4001
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,149
might be trickier but you there's
definitely people that could be

4002
01:11:34,149 --> 01:11:34,159
definitely people that could be
 

4003
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:35,669
definitely people that could be

01:14:32,630 --> 01:14:32,640
competitive programmers like top motor
 

4175
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:33,830
competitive programmers like top motor
and all this kind of stuff he has the

4176
01:14:33,830 --> 01:14:33,840
and all this kind of stuff he has the
 

4177

same kind of element where the brain
 

4179
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,830
same kind of element where the brain
just jumps around really quickly and

4180
01:14:37,830 --> 01:14:37,840
just jumps around really quickly and
 

4181
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,669
just jumps around really quickly and
that's uh yeah

4182
01:14:39,669 --> 01:14:39,679
that's uh yeah
 

4183

like yeah it's motivating but but
 

4187
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:46,630
like yeah it's motivating but but
and you're right in in watching people

4188
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:46,640
and you're right in in watching people
 

4189
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,310
and you're right in in watching people
who are good at what they do it's

4190
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:48,320
who are good at what they do it's
 

4191

it's just like contagious when they're
really good at it and the same kind of

4198
01:14:55,510 --> 01:14:55,520
really good at it and the same kind of
 

4199
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,229
really good at it and the same kind of
analysis with the paper i think

4200
01:14:58,229 --> 01:14:58,239
analysis with the paper i think
 

4201
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:00,229
analysis with the paper i think
so not just like the final result but

4202
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:00,239
so not just like the final result but
 

4203
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:02,390
so not just like the final result but
the process yeah struggling with it

4204
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:02,400
the process yeah struggling with it
 

4205
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,229
the process yeah struggling with it
that's really interesting yeah i think i

4206
01:15:04,229 --> 01:15:04,239
that's really interesting yeah i think i
 

4207
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:06,550
that's really interesting yeah i think i
mean i think twitch proved that like

4208
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:06,560
mean i think twitch proved that like
 

4209
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,229
mean i think twitch proved that like
you know that there's really a market

4210
01:15:08,229 --> 01:15:08,239
you know that there's really a market
 

4211
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:10,870
you know that there's really a market
for for that for watching people

4212
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:10,880
for for that for watching people
 

4213
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,630
for for that for watching people

watching sometimes hours on end of
 

4227
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,270
watching sometimes hours on end of
yeah great craftsmen

4228
01:15:27,270 --> 01:15:27,280
yeah great craftsmen
 

4229
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,189
yeah great craftsmen
do you mind if we talk about some of the

4230
01:15:29,189 --> 01:15:29,199
do you mind if we talk about some of the
 

4231
01:15:29,199 --> 01:15:31,510
do you mind if we talk about some of the
papers do any papers come to mind

4232
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:31,520
papers do any papers come to mind
 

4233
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:32,950
papers do any papers come to mind
that have been annotated on the

4234
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:32,960
that have been annotated on the
 

4235
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,550
that have been annotated on the
vermont's library

4236
01:15:34,550 --> 01:15:34,560
vermont's library
 

4237
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,550
vermont's library
the papers that we annotated can be

4238
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:36,560
the papers that we annotated can be
 

4239
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,149
the papers that we annotated can be
about completely random topics but

4240
01:15:38,149 --> 01:15:38,159
about completely random topics but
 

4241
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:40,310
about completely random topics but
that's part of what we enjoy as well it

4242
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:40,320
that's part of what we enjoy as well it
 

4243
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,070
that's part of what we enjoy as well it
forces you to explore these topics that

4244
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:42,080
forces you to explore these topics that
 

4245
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,470
forces you to explore these topics that
otherwise maybe you'd never run into

4246
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:44,480
otherwise maybe you'd never run into
 

4247
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:46,149
otherwise maybe you'd never run into
uh and so

4248
01:15:46,149 --> 01:15:46,159
uh and so
 

4249
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:48,310
uh and so
so the ones that come to mind that to me

4250
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:48,320
so the ones that come to mind that to me
 

4251
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:51,430
so the ones that come to mind that to me
are fairly random but one that i i

4252
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:51,440
are fairly random but one that i i
 

4253
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:52,950
are fairly random but one that i i
really enjoyed

4254
01:15:52,950 --> 01:15:52,960
really enjoyed
 

4255
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:57,030
really enjoyed
learning more about is um a paper

4256
01:15:57,030 --> 01:15:57,040
learning more about is um a paper
 

4257
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:58,870
learning more about is um a paper
uh written by a mathematician actually

4258
01:15:58,870 --> 01:15:58,880
uh written by a mathematician actually
 

4259
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:03,189
uh written by a mathematician actually
tom apostol and uh about a

4260
01:16:03,189 --> 01:16:03,199
tom apostol and uh about a
 

4261
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:04,550
tom apostol and uh about a
a tunnel

4262
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:04,560
a tunnel
 

4263
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,750
a tunnel
in uh greek island off the coast of

4264
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:07,760
in uh greek island off the coast of
 

4265
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:08,870
in uh greek island off the coast of
turkey

4266
01:16:08,870 --> 01:16:08,880
turkey
 

4267
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,350
turkey
i think it's already random

4268
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:11,360
i think it's already random
 

4269
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:13,830
i think it's already random
so this uh okay so what's interesting

4270
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:13,840
so this uh okay so what's interesting
 

4271
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,790
so this uh okay so what's interesting
about this tunnel so this tunnel um was

4272
01:16:16,790 --> 01:16:16,800
about this tunnel so this tunnel um was
 

4273
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,669
about this tunnel so this tunnel um was
built in the sixth century bc

4274
01:16:19,669 --> 01:16:19,679
built in the sixth century bc
 

4275
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:20,950
built in the sixth century bc
and um

4276
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:20,960
and um
 

4277
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,790
and um
and it was built in this

4278
01:16:22,790 --> 01:16:22,800
and it was built in this
 

4279
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,830
and it was built in this
in the island of samos uh which is as i

4280
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:25,840
in the island of samos uh which is as i
 

4281
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,229
in the island of samos uh which is as i
said off the coast of turkey and um

4282
01:16:28,229 --> 01:16:28,239
said off the coast of turkey and um
 

4283
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:30,390
said off the coast of turkey and um
right they had the city on one side and

4284
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:30,400
right they had the city on one side and
 

4285
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:33,030
right they had the city on one side and
the other mountain and then they had

4286
01:16:33,030 --> 01:16:33,040
the other mountain and then they had
 

4287
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:35,030
the other mountain and then they had
a bunch of springs on the other side and

4288
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:35,040
a bunch of springs on the other side and
 

4289
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,870
a bunch of springs on the other side and
they they wanted to bring water into the

4290
01:16:36,870 --> 01:16:36,880
they they wanted to bring water into the
 

4291
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:37,750
they they wanted to bring water into the
city

4292
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:37,760
city
 

4293
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,310
city
um did building an aqueduct would be

4294
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:40,320
um did building an aqueduct would be
 

4295
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:41,910
um did building an aqueduct would be
pretty hard because of the way the

4296
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:41,920
pretty hard because of the way the
 

4297
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:44,070
pretty hard because of the way the
mountain was shaped and it would also

4298
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:44,080
mountain was shaped and it would also
 

4299
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,430
mountain was shaped and it would also
you know if they if they were under a

4300
01:16:45,430 --> 01:16:45,440
you know if they if they were under a
 

4301
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:46,950
you know if they if they were under a
siege like

4302
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:46,960
siege like
 

4303
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,669
siege like
they could just um easily destroy that

4304
01:16:49,669 --> 01:16:49,679
they could just um easily destroy that
 

4305
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:51,189
they could just um easily destroy that
aqueduct and then the water wouldn't

4306
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:51,199
aqueduct and then the water wouldn't
 

4307
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:52,950
aqueduct and then the water wouldn't
have any water supply the the city

4308
01:16:52,950 --> 01:16:52,960
have any water supply the the city
 

4309
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,950
have any water supply the the city
wouldn't have any water supply and so

4310
01:16:54,950 --> 01:16:54,960
wouldn't have any water supply and so
 

4311
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:57,669
wouldn't have any water supply and so
they decided to build a tunnel

4312
01:16:57,669 --> 01:16:57,679
they decided to build a tunnel
 

4313
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:00,149
they decided to build a tunnel
and they decided to try to do it quickly

4314
01:17:00,149 --> 01:17:00,159
and they decided to try to do it quickly
 

4315
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:01,750
and they decided to try to do it quickly
um and so

4316
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:01,760
um and so
 

4317
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:02,870
um and so
the

4318
01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:02,880
the
 

4319
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,950
the
they started digging

4320
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:04,960
they started digging
 

4321
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:08,470
they started digging
uh from both ends at the same time

4322
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:08,480
uh from both ends at the same time
 

4323
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,630
uh from both ends at the same time
through the mountain right and so

4324
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:10,640
through the mountain right and so
 

4325
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,470
through the mountain right and so
like when you start thinking about this

4326
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:12,480
like when you start thinking about this
 

4327
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:15,189
like when you start thinking about this
it's it's a fairly difficult problem and

4328
01:17:15,189 --> 01:17:15,199
it's it's a fairly difficult problem and
 

4329
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:17,830
it's it's a fairly difficult problem and
this is like 6th century bc so

4330
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:17,840
this is like 6th century bc so
 

4331
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,470
this is like 6th century bc so
you had very limited access

4332
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:20,480
you had very limited access
 

4333
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,709
you had very limited access
to you know the mathematical tools that

4334
01:17:22,709 --> 01:17:22,719
to you know the mathematical tools that
 

4335
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:24,149
to you know the mathematical tools that
you had at the time were very limited

4336
01:17:24,149 --> 01:17:24,159
you had at the time were very limited
 

4337
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:26,950
you had at the time were very limited
and so what this paper is about is about

4338
01:17:26,950 --> 01:17:26,960
and so what this paper is about is about
 

4339
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:29,750
and so what this paper is about is about
the story of how they built it and about

4340
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:29,760
the story of how they built it and about
 

4341
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:32,790
the story of how they built it and about
the fact that for about 2000 years kind

4342
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:32,800
the fact that for about 2000 years kind
 

4343
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,430
the fact that for about 2000 years kind
of the accepted the accepted explanation

4344
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:35,440
of the accepted the accepted explanation
 

4345
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,750
of the accepted the accepted explanation
of how they built it was actually wrong

4346
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:37,760
of how they built it was actually wrong
 

4347
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:39,830
of how they built it was actually wrong
and so this tunnel has been famous for a

4348
01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:39,840
and so this tunnel has been famous for a
 

4349
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,270
and so this tunnel has been famous for a
while there are a number of historians

4350
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:41,280
while there are a number of historians
 

4351
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:44,229
while there are a number of historians
that talked about it since ancient egypt

4352
01:17:44,229 --> 01:17:44,239
that talked about it since ancient egypt
 

4353
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:46,229
that talked about it since ancient egypt
and um and the method that they

4354
01:17:46,229 --> 01:17:46,239
and um and the method that they
 

4355
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:49,830
and um and the method that they
described uh for for building it um is

4356
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:49,840
described uh for for building it um is
 

4357
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:50,790
described uh for for building it um is
is

4358
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:50,800
is
 

4359
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,510
is
uh was just wrong and and so these these

4360
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:53,520
uh was just wrong and and so these these
 

4361
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,990
uh was just wrong and and so these these
researchers went there and and were able

4362
01:17:55,990 --> 01:17:56,000
researchers went there and and were able
 

4363
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,189
researchers went there and and were able
to figure figure that out and so

4364
01:17:59,189 --> 01:17:59,199
to figure figure that out and so
 

4365
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:00,790
to figure figure that out and so
basically kind of the way that they

4366
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:00,800
basically kind of the way that they
 

4367
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,709
basically kind of the way that they
thought they had built it was basically

4368
01:18:02,709 --> 01:18:02,719
thought they had built it was basically
 

4369
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:04,470
thought they had built it was basically
if you can imagine looking at the

4370
01:18:04,470 --> 01:18:04,480
if you can imagine looking at the
 

4371
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,870
if you can imagine looking at the
mountain from the top and you have the

4372
01:18:06,870 --> 01:18:06,880
mountain from the top and you have the
 

4373
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:08,229
mountain from the top and you have the
mountain and then you have both

4374
01:18:08,229 --> 01:18:08,239
mountain and then you have both
 

4375
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:09,990
mountain and then you have both
entrances um

4376
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:10,000
entrances um
 

4377
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,070
entrances um
and so what they what they thought and

4378
01:18:12,070 --> 01:18:12,080
and so what they what they thought and
 

4379
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,070
and so what they what they thought and
what this is what the ancient historians

4380
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:14,080
what this is what the ancient historians
 

4381
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,990
what this is what the ancient historians
described is that they

4382
01:18:15,990 --> 01:18:16,000
described is that they
 

4383
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,270
described is that they
effectively tried to draw a right angle

4384
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:19,280
effectively tried to draw a right angle
 

4385
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,910
effectively tried to draw a right angle
a right angle triangle um

4386
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:21,920
a right angle triangle um
 

4387
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,550
a right angle triangle um
with the two entrances at each end of

4388
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:24,560
with the two entrances at each end of
 

4389
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:27,110
with the two entrances at each end of
the hypotenuse and the way they did is

4390
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:27,120
the hypotenuse and the way they did is
 

4391
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:29,030
the hypotenuse and the way they did is
like they would go around the mountain

4392
01:18:29,030 --> 01:18:29,040
like they would go around the mountain
 

4393
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,350
like they would go around the mountain
and kind of walk in a grid fashion and

4394
01:18:31,350 --> 01:18:31,360
and kind of walk in a grid fashion and
 

4395
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,590
and kind of walk in a grid fashion and
then you can you can figure out uh the

4396
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:33,600
then you can you can figure out uh the
 

4397
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:34,870
then you can you can figure out uh the
two sides

4398
01:18:34,870 --> 01:18:34,880
two sides
 

4399
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,790
two sides
of the triangle and then after you have

4400
01:18:36,790 --> 01:18:36,800
of the triangle and then after you have
 

4401
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,830
of the triangle and then after you have
that triangle you can

4402
01:18:38,830 --> 01:18:38,840
that triangle you can
 

4403
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:42,390
that triangle you can
effectively draw two smaller triangles

4404
01:18:42,390 --> 01:18:42,400
effectively draw two smaller triangles
 

4405
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,229
effectively draw two smaller triangles
at each entrance that are

4406
01:18:44,229 --> 01:18:44,239
at each entrance that are
 

4407
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:46,950
at each entrance that are
proportional to that big triangle

4408
01:18:46,950 --> 01:18:46,960
proportional to that big triangle
 

4409
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,390
proportional to that big triangle
and then you kind of have arrows

4410
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:48,400
and then you kind of have arrows
 

4411
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:49,990
and then you kind of have arrows
pointing in each way

4412
01:18:49,990 --> 01:18:50,000
pointing in each way
 

4413
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,550
pointing in each way
and then you can you know at least that

4414
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:52,560
and then you can you know at least that
 

4415
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,790
and then you can you know at least that
these that you have a line going through

4416
01:18:54,790 --> 01:18:54,800
these that you have a line going through
 

4417
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,630
these that you have a line going through
the the mountain that connects both

4418
01:18:56,630 --> 01:18:56,640
the the mountain that connects both
 

4419
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,310
the the mountain that connects both
entrances

4420
01:18:58,310 --> 01:18:58,320
entrances
 

4421
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,390
entrances
the issue with that is like once you

4422
01:19:00,390 --> 01:19:00,400
the issue with that is like once you
 

4423
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,790
the issue with that is like once you
once you go to this mountain and you

4424
01:19:02,790 --> 01:19:02,800
once you go to this mountain and you
 

4425
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,350
once you go to this mountain and you
start thinking of doing this you realize

4426
01:19:05,350 --> 01:19:05,360
start thinking of doing this you realize
 

4427
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:06,870
start thinking of doing this you realize
that especially given that the tools

4428
01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:06,880
that especially given that the tools
 

4429
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,790
that especially given that the tools
that they had at the time that your

4430
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:08,800
that they had at the time that your
 

4431
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:11,189
that they had at the time that your
error margin would be too small

4432
01:19:11,189 --> 01:19:11,199
error margin would be too small
 

4433
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:13,669
error margin would be too small
you wouldn't be able to do it uh you you

4434
01:19:13,669 --> 01:19:13,679
you wouldn't be able to do it uh you you
 

4435
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:14,550
you wouldn't be able to do it uh you you
you

4436
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:14,560
you
 

4437
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:17,189
you
the just the fact of of trying to to

4438
01:19:17,189 --> 01:19:17,199
the just the fact of of trying to to
 

4439
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:19,350
the just the fact of of trying to to
build this triangle in that fashion the

4440
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:19,360
build this triangle in that fashion the
 

4441
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:21,189
build this triangle in that fashion the
error would accumulate and you would end

4442
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:21,199
error would accumulate and you would end
 

4443
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:22,790
error would accumulate and you would end
up missing you'd start building these

4444
01:19:22,790 --> 01:19:22,800
up missing you'd start building these
 

4445
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,310
up missing you'd start building these
tunnels and they would miss each other

4446
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:24,320
tunnels and they would miss each other
 

4447
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,149
tunnels and they would miss each other
so the task ultimately is to figure out

4448
01:19:26,149 --> 01:19:26,159
so the task ultimately is to figure out
 

4449
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:29,030
so the task ultimately is to figure out
like really perfectly as cl as close as

4450
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:29,040
like really perfectly as cl as close as
 

4451
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,310
like really perfectly as cl as close as
possible the direction you should be

4452
01:19:30,310 --> 01:19:30,320
possible the direction you should be
 

4453
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,630
possible the direction you should be
digging first of all that it's possible

4454
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:32,640
digging first of all that it's possible
 

4455
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,870
digging first of all that it's possible
to have a straight line through and then

4456
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:34,880
to have a straight line through and then
 

4457
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:37,110
to have a straight line through and then
what that the direction would be and

4458
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:37,120
what that the direction would be and
 

4459
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:39,189
what that the direction would be and
then you're trying to infer that by

4460
01:19:39,189 --> 01:19:39,199
then you're trying to infer that by
 

4461
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:41,990
then you're trying to infer that by
constructing a right triangle

4462
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:42,000
constructing a right triangle
 

4463
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,430
constructing a right triangle
by doing i i'm not exactly sure about

4464
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:45,440
by doing i i'm not exactly sure about
 

4465
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:48,229
by doing i i'm not exactly sure about
how to do that rigorously like by

4466
01:19:48,229 --> 01:19:48,239
how to do that rigorously like by
 

4467
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:50,149
how to do that rigorously like by
tracing the mountain by walking along

4468
01:19:50,149 --> 01:19:50,159
tracing the mountain by walking along
 

4469
01:19:50,159 --> 01:19:52,229
tracing the mountain by walking along
the mountain how to you said grids yeah

4470
01:19:52,229 --> 01:19:52,239
the mountain how to you said grids yeah
 

4471
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:54,709
the mountain how to you said grids yeah
you kind of walk as if you were in a in

4472
01:19:54,709 --> 01:19:54,719
you kind of walk as if you were in a in
 

4473
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:56,709
you kind of walk as if you were in a in
a grid and so you just walk in right

4474
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:56,719
a grid and so you just walk in right
 

4475
01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:59,030
a grid and so you just walk in right
angles i so right but then you have to

4476
01:19:59,030 --> 01:19:59,040
angles i so right but then you have to
 

4477
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,030
angles i so right but then you have to
walk really precisely then exactly you

4478
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:01,040
walk really precisely then exactly you
 

4479
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:03,270
walk really precisely then exactly you
have to use tools to measure this and

4480
01:20:03,270 --> 01:20:03,280
have to use tools to measure this and
 

4481
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:05,750
have to use tools to measure this and
then the terrain is probably yeah very

4482
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:05,760
then the terrain is probably yeah very
 

4483
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,229
then the terrain is probably yeah very
messed up so this makes more sense in 2d

4484
01:20:08,229 --> 01:20:08,239
messed up so this makes more sense in 2d
 

4485
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:10,390
messed up so this makes more sense in 2d
and 3d gets even weirder

4486
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:10,400
and 3d gets even weirder
 

4487
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,110
and 3d gets even weirder
so okay gotcha but so this method was

4488
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:13,120
so okay gotcha but so this method was
 

4489
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:16,070
so okay gotcha but so this method was
described by like an ancient egyptian

4490
01:20:16,070 --> 01:20:16,080
described by like an ancient egyptian
 

4491
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:18,790
described by like an ancient egyptian
historian i think hero of alexandria and

4492
01:20:18,790 --> 01:20:18,800
historian i think hero of alexandria and
 

4493
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,790
historian i think hero of alexandria and
um and then for about like yeah for

4494
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:20,800
um and then for about like yeah for
 

4495
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,950
um and then for about like yeah for
about 2000 years that's that's how like

4496
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:22,960
about 2000 years that's that's how like
 

4497
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,149
about 2000 years that's that's how like
that's how we thought that they had

4498
01:20:24,149 --> 01:20:24,159
that's how we thought that they had
 

4499
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:27,430
that's how we thought that they had
built this this tunnel um

4500
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:27,440
built this this tunnel um
 

4501
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,709
built this this tunnel um
and then in the end then these

4502
01:20:28,709 --> 01:20:28,719
and then in the end then these
 

4503
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:30,950
and then in the end then these
researchers went there and and found out

4504
01:20:30,950 --> 01:20:30,960
researchers went there and and found out
 

4505
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,510
researchers went there and and found out
that actually they they must have had to

4506
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:33,520
that actually they they must have had to
 

4507
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,750
that actually they they must have had to
to use other methods and and then in

4508
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:35,760
to use other methods and and then in
 

4509
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,149
to use other methods and and then in
this paper they describe these these

4510
01:20:38,149 --> 01:20:38,159
this paper they describe these these
 

4511
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:40,149
this paper they describe these these
other methods and of course they can't

4512
01:20:40,149 --> 01:20:40,159
other methods and of course they can't
 

4513
01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:42,229
other methods and of course they can't
know for sure but there's uh they

4514
01:20:42,229 --> 01:20:42,239
know for sure but there's uh they
 

4515
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:44,629
know for sure but there's uh they
presented a bunch of plausible

4516
01:20:44,629 --> 01:20:44,639
presented a bunch of plausible
 

4517
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:46,790
presented a bunch of plausible
alternatives the one that for me was is

4518
01:20:46,790 --> 01:20:46,800
alternatives the one that for me was is
 

4519
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,709
alternatives the one that for me was is
the most plausible is that what they

4520
01:20:48,709 --> 01:20:48,719
the most plausible is that what they
 

4521
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:50,629
the most plausible is that what they
probably must have done is to use

4522
01:20:50,629 --> 01:20:50,639
probably must have done is to use
 

4523
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:52,709
probably must have done is to use
something that is similar to

4524
01:20:52,709 --> 01:20:52,719
something that is similar to
 

4525
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:56,070
something that is similar to
an iron sight on a rifle the way you can

4526
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:56,080
an iron sight on a rifle the way you can
 

4527
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:58,950
an iron sight on a rifle the way you can
line up uh your rifle with the target

4528
01:20:58,950 --> 01:20:58,960
line up uh your rifle with the target
 

4529
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:01,669
line up uh your rifle with the target
off in the distance by by having an iron

4530
01:21:01,669 --> 01:21:01,679
off in the distance by by having an iron
 

4531
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:02,629
off in the distance by by having an iron
sight

4532
01:21:02,629 --> 01:21:02,639
sight
 

4533
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:03,830
sight
um

4534
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:03,840
um
 

4535
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:06,950
um
and uh and they they they must have done

4536
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:06,960
and uh and they they they must have done
 

4537
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,270
and uh and they they they must have done
something similar to that effectively

4538
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:09,280
something similar to that effectively
 

4539
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:12,070
something similar to that effectively
with tree with three sticks and that way

4540
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:12,080
with tree with three sticks and that way
 

4541
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,510
with tree with three sticks and that way
they were able to

4542
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:13,520
they were able to
 

4543
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:14,550
they were able to
line up

4544
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:14,560
line up
 

4545
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,070
line up
sticks

4546
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:16,080
sticks
 

4547
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,149
sticks
along the side of the mountain that were

4548
01:21:18,149 --> 01:21:18,159
along the side of the mountain that were
 

4549
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:20,310
along the side of the mountain that were
all on the same height

4550
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:20,320
all on the same height
 

4551
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,750
all on the same height
and so that then you could get to the

4552
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:21,760
and so that then you could get to the
 

4553
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,830
and so that then you could get to the
other side and you could cut and then

4554
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:23,840
other side and you could cut and then
 

4555
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,430
other side and you could cut and then
you could draw that line

4556
01:21:25,430 --> 01:21:25,440
you could draw that line
 

4557
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:28,390
you could draw that line
so this for me is the most plausible

4558
01:21:28,390 --> 01:21:28,400
so this for me is the most plausible
 

4559
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,070
so this for me is the most plausible
way that they might have done that and

4560
01:21:30,070 --> 01:21:30,080
way that they might have done that and
 

4561
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:31,270
way that they might have done that and
they

4562
01:21:31,270 --> 01:21:31,280
they
 

4563
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:33,510
they
but then they they they describe this in

4564
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:33,520
but then they they they describe this in
 

4565
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,669
but then they they they describe this in
detail and other possible approaches in

4566
01:21:35,669 --> 01:21:35,679
detail and other possible approaches in
 

4567
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:37,990
detail and other possible approaches in
this paper so this is a mathematician

4568
01:21:37,990 --> 01:21:38,000
this paper so this is a mathematician
 

4569
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,149
this paper so this is a mathematician
doing this yeah this is a mathematician

4570
01:21:40,149 --> 01:21:40,159
doing this yeah this is a mathematician
 

4571
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:42,870
doing this yeah this is a mathematician
that did this um which i suppose is the

4572
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:42,880
that did this um which i suppose is the
 

4573
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,149
that did this um which i suppose is the
right

4574
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:44,159
right
 

4575
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:46,310
right
mindset instead of skills required to

4576
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:46,320
mindset instead of skills required to
 

4577
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:49,189
mindset instead of skills required to
solve an ancient problem right yeah

4578
01:21:49,189 --> 01:21:49,199
solve an ancient problem right yeah
 

4579
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:50,470
solve an ancient problem right yeah
yeah there's mathematicians and

4580
01:21:50,470 --> 01:21:50,480
yeah there's mathematicians and
 

4581
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,709
yeah there's mathematicians and
engineers a lot of things because they

4582
01:21:52,709 --> 01:21:52,719
engineers a lot of things because they
 

4583
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:55,510
engineers a lot of things because they
didn't have uh computers or drones or

4584
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:55,520
didn't have uh computers or drones or
 

4585
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,430
didn't have uh computers or drones or
lidar back then or whatever technology

4586
01:21:57,430 --> 01:21:57,440
lidar back then or whatever technology
 

4587
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,189
lidar back then or whatever technology
you would use modern day for civil

4588
01:21:59,189 --> 01:21:59,199
you would use modern day for civil
 

4589
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:01,750
you would use modern day for civil
engineering yeah and another fascinating

4590
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:01,760
engineering yeah and another fascinating
 

4591
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,030
engineering yeah and another fascinating
thing is that like

4592
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:03,040
thing is that like
 

4593
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,550
thing is that like
you know after

4594
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:04,560
you know after
 

4595
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,709
you know after
effectively after the the downfall of

4596
01:22:06,709 --> 01:22:06,719
effectively after the the downfall of
 

4597
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:08,790
effectively after the the downfall of
the roman civilization people didn't

4598
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:08,800
the roman civilization people didn't
 

4599
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:11,189
the roman civilization people didn't
build tunnels for about a thousand years

4600
01:22:11,189 --> 01:22:11,199
build tunnels for about a thousand years
 

4601
01:22:11,199 --> 01:22:12,950
build tunnels for about a thousand years
we go a thousand years without tunnels

4602
01:22:12,950 --> 01:22:12,960
we go a thousand years without tunnels
 

4603
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:15,030
we go a thousand years without tunnels
and then like only in like in late

4604
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:15,040
and then like only in like in late
 

4605
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,870
and then like only in like in late
middle ages that we start doing them

4606
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:16,880
middle ages that we start doing them
 

4607
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,270
middle ages that we start doing them
again but uh but here is the tunnel like

4608
01:22:19,270 --> 01:22:19,280
again but uh but here is the tunnel like
 

4609
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,430
again but uh but here is the tunnel like
6th century bc like incredibly limited

4610
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:21,440
6th century bc like incredibly limited
 

4611
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,910
6th century bc like incredibly limited
mathematics and they and they build it

4612
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:23,920
mathematics and they and they build it
 

4613
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,910
mathematics and they and they build it
in this way um

4614
01:22:25,910 --> 01:22:25,920
in this way um
 

4615
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,550
in this way um
and and and for and it was a mystery for

4616
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:28,560
and and and for and it was a mystery for
 

4617
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:30,229
and and and for and it was a mystery for
for a long time exactly how they did it

4618
01:22:30,229 --> 01:22:30,239
for a long time exactly how they did it
 

4619
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:31,830
for a long time exactly how they did it
and then these mathematicians went there

4620
01:22:31,830 --> 01:22:31,840
and then these mathematicians went there
 

4621
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:33,910
and then these mathematicians went there
and and uh

4622
01:22:33,910 --> 01:22:33,920
and and uh
 

4623
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,830
and and uh
and and basically with no archaeology

4624
01:22:35,830 --> 01:22:35,840
and and basically with no archaeology
 

4625
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,430
and and basically with no archaeology
kind of background we're able to figure

4626
01:22:37,430 --> 01:22:37,440
kind of background we're able to figure
 

4627
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,149
kind of background we're able to figure
it out how do annotations for this paper

4628
01:22:40,149 --> 01:22:40,159
it out how do annotations for this paper
 

4629
01:22:40,159 --> 01:22:41,910
it out how do annotations for this paper
look like what is it uh what's a

4630
01:22:41,910 --> 01:22:41,920
look like what is it uh what's a
 

4631
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,070
look like what is it uh what's a
successful annotation for paper like

4632
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:44,080
successful annotation for paper like
 

4633
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:44,790
successful annotation for paper like
this

4634
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:44,800
this
 

4635
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,950
this
yes so sometimes you're uh for this

4636
01:22:46,950 --> 01:22:46,960
yes so sometimes you're uh for this
 

4637
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,870
yes so sometimes you're uh for this
paper um

4638
01:22:48,870 --> 01:22:48,880
paper um
 

4639
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:51,669
paper um
sometimes adding some more context uh on

4640
01:22:51,669 --> 01:22:51,679
sometimes adding some more context uh on
 

4641
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:54,310
sometimes adding some more context uh on
on a specific um

4642
01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:54,320
on a specific um
 

4643
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,390
on a specific um
part like sometimes they they mentioned

4644
01:22:56,390 --> 01:22:56,400
part like sometimes they they mentioned
 

4645
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,830
part like sometimes they they mentioned
for instance um

4646
01:22:57,830 --> 01:22:57,840
for instance um
 

4647
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:58,790
for instance um
these

4648
01:22:58,790 --> 01:22:58,800
these
 

4649
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,550
these
instruments that were common in ancient

4650
01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:00,560
instruments that were common in ancient
 

4651
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:02,870
instruments that were common in ancient
greece and an ancient rome

4652
01:23:02,870 --> 01:23:02,880
greece and an ancient rome
 

4653
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:06,070
greece and an ancient rome
for for building things and uh and and

4654
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:06,080
for for building things and uh and and
 

4655
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:08,390
for for building things and uh and and
so in some of those annotations i

4656
01:23:08,390 --> 01:23:08,400
so in some of those annotations i
 

4657
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,990
so in some of those annotations i
described these instruments in more

4658
01:23:09,990 --> 01:23:10,000
described these instruments in more
 

4659
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,669
described these instruments in more
detail and how they worked because

4660
01:23:11,669 --> 01:23:11,679
detail and how they worked because
 

4661
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:14,629
detail and how they worked because
sometimes it can be hard to to visualize

4662
01:23:14,629 --> 01:23:14,639
sometimes it can be hard to to visualize
 

4663
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:16,870
sometimes it can be hard to to visualize
these um

4664
01:23:16,870 --> 01:23:16,880
these um
 

4665
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:20,550
these um
then this paper um i forget exactly when

4666
01:23:20,550 --> 01:23:20,560
then this paper um i forget exactly when
 

4667
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,950
then this paper um i forget exactly when
when this was published uh i believe

4668
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:22,960
when this was published uh i believe
 

4669
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:26,149
when this was published uh i believe
maybe maybe the 70s um but then there

4670
01:23:26,149 --> 01:23:26,159
maybe maybe the 70s um but then there
 

4671
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:28,709
maybe maybe the 70s um but then there
was further research into this tunnel

4672
01:23:28,709 --> 01:23:28,719
was further research into this tunnel
 

4673
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:30,310
was further research into this tunnel
and more interesting other interesting

4674
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:30,320
and more interesting other interesting
 

4675
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:32,550
and more interesting other interesting
aspects about it i add those to that

4676
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:32,560
aspects about it i add those to that
 

4677
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:35,750
aspects about it i add those to that
paper as well there's historical context

4678
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:35,760
paper as well there's historical context
 

4679
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,709
paper as well there's historical context
that i also go into uh there

4680
01:23:38,709 --> 01:23:38,719
that i also go into uh there
 

4681
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:40,470
that i also go into uh there
for instance the fact that as a as i

4682
01:23:40,470 --> 01:23:40,480
for instance the fact that as a as i
 

4683
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:42,790
for instance the fact that as a as i
said that effectively after the downfall

4684
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:42,800
said that effectively after the downfall
 

4685
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,390
said that effectively after the downfall
of the roman empire no tunnels were

4686
01:23:44,390 --> 01:23:44,400
of the roman empire no tunnels were
 

4687
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:45,910
of the roman empire no tunnels were
built like that's something that i that

4688
01:23:45,910 --> 01:23:45,920
built like that's something that i that
 

4689
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,990
built like that's something that i that
i go that i that i added to the paper as

4690
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:48,000
i go that i that i added to the paper as
 

4691
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:48,709
i go that i that i added to the paper as
well

4692
01:23:48,709 --> 01:23:48,719
well
 

4693
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:50,550
well
yeah so so this is so when other people

4694
01:23:50,550 --> 01:23:50,560
yeah so so this is so when other people
 

4695
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,070
yeah so so this is so when other people
look at the paper

4696
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:52,080
look at the paper
 

4697
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,189
look at the paper
how did they usually consume the

4698
01:23:53,189 --> 01:23:53,199
how did they usually consume the
 

4699
01:23:53,199 --> 01:23:55,430
how did they usually consume the
annotations so they it's like is there a

4700
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:55,440
annotations so they it's like is there a
 

4701
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,990
annotations so they it's like is there a
commenting feature is uh

4702
01:23:57,990 --> 01:23:58,000
commenting feature is uh
 

4703
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,030
commenting feature is uh
i mean like

4704
01:23:59,030 --> 01:23:59,040
i mean like
 

4705
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:01,110
i mean like
this is a really enriching experience

4706
01:24:01,110 --> 01:24:01,120
this is a really enriching experience
 

4707
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,030
this is a really enriching experience
the way you read a paper

4708
01:24:03,030 --> 01:24:03,040
the way you read a paper
 

4709
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:05,350
the way you read a paper
what what aspects do you do people

4710
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:05,360
what what aspects do you do people
 

4711
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:07,590
what what aspects do you do people
usually talk about that they value from

4712
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:07,600
usually talk about that they value from
 

4713
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,629
usually talk about that they value from
this

4714
01:24:08,629 --> 01:24:08,639
this
 

4715
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:11,030
this
so yeah so anybody can just go on there

4716
01:24:11,030 --> 01:24:11,040
so yeah so anybody can just go on there
 

4717
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:14,070
so yeah so anybody can just go on there
and and either add a new annotation or

4718
01:24:14,070 --> 01:24:14,080
and and either add a new annotation or
 

4719
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:16,070
and and either add a new annotation or
other a comment to an existing

4720
01:24:16,070 --> 01:24:16,080
other a comment to an existing
 

4721
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,709
other a comment to an existing
annotation and so you can start a kind

4722
01:24:18,709 --> 01:24:18,719
annotation and so you can start a kind
 

4723
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:20,709
annotation and so you can start a kind
of a thread uh within an existing

4724
01:24:20,709 --> 01:24:20,719
of a thread uh within an existing
 

4725
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:23,189
of a thread uh within an existing
annotation um and that's something that

4726
01:24:23,189 --> 01:24:23,199
annotation um and that's something that
 

4727
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:25,669
annotation um and that's something that
happens relative frequency and then

4728
01:24:25,669 --> 01:24:25,679
happens relative frequency and then
 

4729
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:27,590
happens relative frequency and then
because i was the original author of the

4730
01:24:27,590 --> 01:24:27,600
because i was the original author of the
 

4731
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,470
because i was the original author of the
initial annotation i get pinged and so

4732
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:30,480
initial annotation i get pinged and so
 

4733
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,870
initial annotation i get pinged and so
often times i'll go back and and

4734
01:24:32,870 --> 01:24:32,880
often times i'll go back and and
 

4735
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,110
often times i'll go back and and
and add on to to that thread how did you

4736
01:24:35,110 --> 01:24:35,120
and add on to to that thread how did you
 

4737
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:36,950
and add on to to that thread how did you
pick the paper that's i mean first of

4738
01:24:36,950 --> 01:24:36,960
pick the paper that's i mean first of
 

4739
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,709
pick the paper that's i mean first of
all this whole process is really

4740
01:24:38,709 --> 01:24:38,719
all this whole process is really
 

4741
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:40,950
all this whole process is really
exciting i'm gonna especially after this

opportunity for people like me
 

4761
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:04,310
opportunity for people like me
to publicly annotate a paper

4762
01:25:04,310 --> 01:25:04,320
to publicly annotate a paper
 

4763
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:05,110
to publicly annotate a paper
like

4764
01:25:05,110 --> 01:25:05,120
like
 

4765

be in the conversation about a paper

4772
01:25:13,590 --> 01:25:13,600
be in the conversation about a paper
 

4773
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,990
be in the conversation about a paper
it's like a place to have a conversation

4774
01:25:15,990 --> 01:25:16,000
it's like a place to have a conversation
 

4775
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,149
it's like a place to have a conversation
about an idea you could the other way to

4776
01:25:18,149 --> 01:25:18,159
about an idea you could the other way to
 

4777
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:19,830
about an idea you could the other way to
do it that's much more ad hoc is on

4778
01:25:19,830 --> 01:25:19,840
do it that's much more ad hoc is on
 

4779
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:22,070
do it that's much more ad hoc is on
twitter right but this is more like

4780
01:25:22,070 --> 01:25:22,080
twitter right but this is more like
 

4781
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,510
twitter right but this is more like
formal and you could actually probably

4782
01:25:23,510 --> 01:25:23,520
formal and you could actually probably
 

4783
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,270
formal and you could actually probably
integrate the two they have a

4784
01:25:25,270 --> 01:25:25,280
integrate the two they have a
 

4785
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:27,270
integrate the two they have a
conversation about the conversation so

4786
01:25:27,270 --> 01:25:27,280
conversation about the conversation so
 

4787
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,350
conversation about the conversation so
the twitter is the conversation about a

4788
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:29,360
the twitter is the conversation about a
 

4789
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,270
the twitter is the conversation about a
conversation and the main conversation

4790
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:31,280
conversation and the main conversation
 

4791
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,430
conversation and the main conversation
is in the space of annotations there's

4792
01:25:33,430 --> 01:25:33,440
is in the space of annotations there's
 

4793
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,590
is in the space of annotations there's
an interesting effect that we we see

4794
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:35,600
an interesting effect that we we see
 

4795
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,350
an interesting effect that we we see
sometimes with the annotations on our

4796
01:25:37,350 --> 01:25:37,360
sometimes with the annotations on our
 

4797
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:38,790
sometimes with the annotations on our
papers is that a lot of people

4798
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:38,800
papers is that a lot of people
 

4799
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,350
papers is that a lot of people
especially if we the annotations are

4800
01:25:41,350 --> 01:25:41,360
especially if we the annotations are
 

4801
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:44,390
especially if we the annotations are
really well done people sometimes

4802
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:44,400
really well done people sometimes
 

4803
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,950
really well done people sometimes
are afraid of adding more annotations

4804
01:25:46,950 --> 01:25:46,960
are afraid of adding more annotations
 

4805
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:48,390
are afraid of adding more annotations
because they see that as a kind of a

4806
01:25:48,390 --> 01:25:48,400
because they see that as a kind of a
 

4807
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,629
because they see that as a kind of a
finished work yes and so they they don't

4808
01:25:50,629 --> 01:25:50,639
finished work yes and so they they don't
 

4809
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:53,030
finished work yes and so they they don't
want to pollute that or

4810
01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:53,040
want to pollute that or
 

4811
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:54,709
want to pollute that or
and especially if it's like a silly

4812
01:25:54,709 --> 01:25:54,719
and especially if it's like a silly
 

4813
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:55,910
and especially if it's like a silly
question this is

4814
01:25:55,910 --> 01:25:55,920
question this is
 

4815
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:57,590
question this is
i don't think that's good i think you

4816
01:25:57,590 --> 01:25:57,600
i don't think that's good i think you
 

4817
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:58,550
i don't think that's good i think you
know

4818
01:25:58,550 --> 01:25:58,560
know
 

4819
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,390
know
we should as much as possible try to

4820
01:26:00,390 --> 01:26:00,400
we should as much as possible try to
 

4821
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,229
we should as much as possible try to
lower the barrier for someone to jump in

4822
01:26:02,229 --> 01:26:02,239
lower the barrier for someone to jump in
 

4823
01:26:02,239 --> 01:26:04,629
lower the barrier for someone to jump in
and ask questions i think it only like

4824
01:26:04,629 --> 01:26:04,639
and ask questions i think it only like
 

4825
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:06,790
and ask questions i think it only like
most of the times it adds value but it's

4826
01:26:06,790 --> 01:26:06,800
most of the times it adds value but it's
 

4827
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:09,430
most of the times it adds value but it's
some feedback that we got from users and

4828
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:09,440
some feedback that we got from users and
 

4829
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:11,110
some feedback that we got from users and
and readers

4830
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:11,120
and readers
 

4831
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:11,990
and readers
um

4832
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:12,000
um
 

4833
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,310
um
i'm not exactly sure how to

4834
01:26:14,310 --> 01:26:14,320
i'm not exactly sure how to
 

4835
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:17,669
i'm not exactly sure how to
to kind of fight that but um well i

4836
01:26:17,669 --> 01:26:17,679
to kind of fight that but um well i
 

4837
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:18,790
to kind of fight that but um well i
think i

4838
01:26:18,790 --> 01:26:18,800
think i
 

4839
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:22,149
think i
i think if i serve as an inspiration

4840
01:26:22,149 --> 01:26:22,159
i think if i serve as an inspiration
 

4841
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:23,590
i think if i serve as an inspiration
in any way

4842
01:26:23,590 --> 01:26:23,600
in any way
 

4843
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,830
in any way
is by asking a lot of dumb questions and

4844
01:26:25,830 --> 01:26:25,840
is by asking a lot of dumb questions and
 

4845
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:27,830
is by asking a lot of dumb questions and
saying a bunch of dumb [\h__\h] all the time

4846
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:27,840
saying a bunch of dumb [\h__\h] all the time
 

4847
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,070
saying a bunch of dumb [\h__\h] all the time
and hopefully that inspires the rest of

4848
01:26:30,070 --> 01:26:30,080
and hopefully that inspires the rest of
 

4849
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:32,310
and hopefully that inspires the rest of
uh other folks to do the same because

4850
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:32,320
uh other folks to do the same because
 

4851
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,550
uh other folks to do the same because
that's the only way to knowledge i think

4852
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:34,560
that's the only way to knowledge i think
 

4853
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:35,510
that's the only way to knowledge i think
is to

4854
01:26:35,510 --> 01:26:35,520
is to
 

4855
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,669
is to
be willing to ask the dumb questions and

4856
01:26:37,669 --> 01:26:37,679
be willing to ask the dumb questions and
 

4857
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:39,669
be willing to ask the dumb questions and
and there are papers that are like um

4858
01:26:39,669 --> 01:26:39,679
and there are papers that are like um
 

4859
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:41,350
and there are papers that are like um
and we have a lot of papers on formats

4860
01:26:41,350 --> 01:26:41,360
and we have a lot of papers on formats
 

4861
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,510
and we have a lot of papers on formats
where it's just one page or really short

4862
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:43,520
where it's just one page or really short
 

4863
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:44,470
where it's just one page or really short
papers

4864
01:26:44,470 --> 01:26:44,480
papers
 

4865
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:47,110
papers
and you we have like the shortest paper

4866
01:26:47,110 --> 01:26:47,120
and you we have like the shortest paper
 

4867
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:49,350
and you we have like the shortest paper
ever published in a math journal like

4868
01:26:49,350 --> 01:26:49,360
ever published in a math journal like
 

4869
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,350
ever published in a math journal like
with like just a couple of words

4870
01:26:51,350 --> 01:26:51,360
with like just a couple of words
 

4871
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:52,790
with like just a couple of words
one of my favorite papers on the

4872
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:52,800
one of my favorite papers on the
 

4873
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:55,270
one of my favorite papers on the
platform is actually a paper um written

4874
01:26:55,270 --> 01:26:55,280
platform is actually a paper um written
 

4875
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:58,070
platform is actually a paper um written
by enrico fermi yeah and the title of

4876
01:26:58,070 --> 01:26:58,080
by enrico fermi yeah and the title of
 

4877
01:26:58,080 --> 01:26:59,910
by enrico fermi yeah and the title of
the paper is myop's i think it's my

4878
01:26:59,910 --> 01:26:59,920
the paper is myop's i think it's my
 

4879
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,070
the paper is myop's i think it's my
observations at trinity so basically

4880
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:02,080
observations at trinity so basically
 

4881
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:04,870
observations at trinity so basically
fermi was part of the manhattan project

4882
01:27:04,870 --> 01:27:04,880
fermi was part of the manhattan project
 

4883
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:08,310
fermi was part of the manhattan project
so he was in new mexico when um they

4884
01:27:08,310 --> 01:27:08,320
so he was in new mexico when um they
 

4885
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:10,950
so he was in new mexico when um they
exploded the first atomic bomb

4886
01:27:10,950 --> 01:27:10,960
exploded the first atomic bomb
 

4887
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,950
exploded the first atomic bomb
and so he was a couple of miles away

4888
01:27:12,950 --> 01:27:12,960
and so he was a couple of miles away
 

4889
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:14,790
and so he was a couple of miles away
from the explosion and he was probably

4890
01:27:14,790 --> 01:27:14,800
from the explosion and he was probably
 

4891
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,870
from the explosion and he was probably
one of the first persons to calculate

4892
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:16,880
one of the first persons to calculate
 

4893
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:19,750
one of the first persons to calculate
the energy of the explosion and so the

4894
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:19,760
the energy of the explosion and so the
 

4895
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:22,550
the energy of the explosion and so the
way he did that was he took a piece of

4896
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:22,560
way he did that was he took a piece of
 

4897
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:24,870
way he did that was he took a piece of
paper and he tore down a piece of paper

4898
01:27:24,870 --> 01:27:24,880
paper and he tore down a piece of paper
 

4899
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:27,350
paper and he tore down a piece of paper
in little pieces and when the bomb

4900
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:27,360
in little pieces and when the bomb
 

4901
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:28,550
in little pieces and when the bomb
exploded

4902
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:28,560
exploded
 

4903
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:29,990
exploded
the trinity bomb was the name of the

4904
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:30,000
the trinity bomb was the name of the
 

4905
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,990
the trinity bomb was the name of the
bomb like he waited for the blast to

4906
01:27:31,990 --> 01:27:32,000
bomb like he waited for the blast to
 

4907
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,189
bomb like he waited for the blast to
arrive at

4908
01:27:33,189 --> 01:27:33,199
arrive at
 

4909
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:34,709
arrive at
where he was

4910
01:27:34,709 --> 01:27:34,719
where he was
 

4911
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:36,790
where he was
and then he threw those pieces of paper

4912
01:27:36,790 --> 01:27:36,800
and then he threw those pieces of paper
 

4913
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,950
and then he threw those pieces of paper
in the air and he calculated the energy

4914
01:27:38,950 --> 01:27:38,960
in the air and he calculated the energy
 

4915
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:41,350
in the air and he calculated the energy
based on the displacement of the paper

4916
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:41,360
based on the displacement of the paper
 

4917
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,590
based on the displacement of the paper
the pieces of paper and then he wrote a

4918
01:27:43,590 --> 01:27:43,600
the pieces of paper and then he wrote a
 

4919
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,590
the pieces of paper and then he wrote a
report which was classified until like a

4920
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:45,600
report which was classified until like a
 

4921
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:48,229
report which was classified until like a
couple of years ago one page report like

4922
01:27:48,229 --> 01:27:48,239
couple of years ago one page report like
 

4923
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:50,709
couple of years ago one page report like
calculating the energy of the explosion

4924
01:27:50,709 --> 01:27:50,719
calculating the energy of the explosion
 

4925
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:53,270
calculating the energy of the explosion
uh it's so badass and i i we actually

4926
01:27:53,270 --> 01:27:53,280
uh it's so badass and i i we actually
 

4927
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:55,830
uh it's so badass and i i we actually
went there and kind of unpacked and like

4928
01:27:55,830 --> 01:27:55,840
went there and kind of unpacked and like
 

4929
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,350
went there and kind of unpacked and like
yeah i think it just mentions basically

4930
01:27:57,350 --> 01:27:57,360
yeah i think it just mentions basically
 

4931
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:59,750
yeah i think it just mentions basically
the energy and we we actually went and

4932
01:27:59,750 --> 01:27:59,760
the energy and we we actually went and
 

4933
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:00,950
the energy and we we actually went and
one of the annotations is like

4934
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:00,960
one of the annotations is like
 

4935
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,629
one of the annotations is like
explaining how he did that

4936
01:28:02,629 --> 01:28:02,639
explaining how he did that
 

4937
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:05,030
explaining how he did that
um i wonder how accurate he was

4938
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:05,040
um i wonder how accurate he was
 

4939
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:08,070
um i wonder how accurate he was
it was maybe i think like 20 20 or 25

4940
01:28:08,070 --> 01:28:08,080
it was maybe i think like 20 20 or 25
 

4941
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:10,229
it was maybe i think like 20 20 or 25
off uh then there was another person

4942
01:28:10,229 --> 01:28:10,239
off uh then there was another person
 

4943
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:12,070
off uh then there was another person
that actually calculated the energy

4944
01:28:12,070 --> 01:28:12,080
that actually calculated the energy
 

4945
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:15,350
that actually calculated the energy
based on uh images after the explosion

4946
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:15,360
based on uh images after the explosion
 

4947
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,590
based on uh images after the explosion
at the rate uh and the rate that which

4948
01:28:17,590 --> 01:28:17,600
at the rate uh and the rate that which
 

4949
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,229
at the rate uh and the rate that which
the the the like the mushroom of the

4950
01:28:20,229 --> 01:28:20,239
the the the like the mushroom of the
 

4951
01:28:20,239 --> 01:28:21,910
the the the like the mushroom of the
explosion expanded and it's more

4952
01:28:21,910 --> 01:28:21,920
explosion expanded and it's more
 

4953
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:23,430
explosion expanded and it's more
accurate to calculate the energy based

4954
01:28:23,430 --> 01:28:23,440
accurate to calculate the energy based
 

4955
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:26,470
accurate to calculate the energy based
on that um and i think it was like 20 20

4956
01:28:26,470 --> 01:28:26,480
on that um and i think it was like 20 20
 

4957
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:28,390
on that um and i think it was like 20 20
off but it's it's really interesting

4958
01:28:28,390 --> 01:28:28,400
off but it's it's really interesting
 

4959
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,629
off but it's it's really interesting
because you know fermi was known for all

4960
01:28:30,629 --> 01:28:30,639
because you know fermi was known for all
 

4961
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:32,870
because you know fermi was known for all
these being a master at this back of the

4962
01:28:32,870 --> 01:28:32,880
these being a master at this back of the
 

4963
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,870
these being a master at this back of the
envelope calculations always like the

4964
01:28:34,870 --> 01:28:34,880
envelope calculations always like the
 

4965
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,950
envelope calculations always like the
the fermi problems are well known for

4966
01:28:36,950 --> 01:28:36,960
the fermi problems are well known for
 

4967
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,669
the fermi problems are well known for
for that um and it's super interesting

4968
01:28:39,669 --> 01:28:39,679
for that um and it's super interesting
 

4969
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:41,910
for that um and it's super interesting
to see like that just one page report

4970
01:28:41,910 --> 01:28:41,920
to see like that just one page report
 

4971
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:44,229
to see like that just one page report
and was also actually classified and

4972
01:28:44,229 --> 01:28:44,239
and was also actually classified and
 

4973
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:45,990
and was also actually classified and
it's interesting because a couple months

4974
01:28:45,990 --> 01:28:46,000
it's interesting because a couple months
 

4975
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,950
it's interesting because a couple months
ago when the beirut explosion happened

4976
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:48,960
ago when the beirut explosion happened
 

4977
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:52,070
ago when the beirut explosion happened
there was a video circulating of these a

4978
01:28:52,070 --> 01:28:52,080
there was a video circulating of these a
 

4979
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:54,709
there was a video circulating of these a
bride that was doing a photo shoot

4980
01:28:54,709 --> 01:28:54,719
bride that was doing a photo shoot
 

4981
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:56,550
bride that was doing a photo shoot
when the explosion in beirut happened

4982
01:28:56,550 --> 01:28:56,560
when the explosion in beirut happened
 

4983
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,070
when the explosion in beirut happened
and so you can see a video of her with

4984
01:28:58,070 --> 01:28:58,080
and so you can see a video of her with
 

4985
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:59,750
and so you can see a video of her with
the wedding dress and then the explosion

4986
01:28:59,750 --> 01:28:59,760
the wedding dress and then the explosion
 

4987
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,669
the wedding dress and then the explosion
happens and the blast arrives at where

4988
01:29:01,669 --> 01:29:01,679
happens and the blast arrives at where
 

4989
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:03,430
happens and the blast arrives at where
she was she was a couple of miles away

4990
01:29:03,430 --> 01:29:03,440
she was she was a couple of miles away
 

4991
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:06,950
she was she was a couple of miles away
from the glass and you can see like um

4992
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:06,960
from the glass and you can see like um
 

4993
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:09,189
from the glass and you can see like um
the displacement of the dress as well

4994
01:29:09,189 --> 01:29:09,199
the displacement of the dress as well
 

4995
01:29:09,199 --> 01:29:10,629
the displacement of the dress as well
and i actually looked and that video

4996
01:29:10,629 --> 01:29:10,639
and i actually looked and that video
 

4997
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:12,310
and i actually looked and that video
went viral on twitter and i actually

4998
01:29:12,310 --> 01:29:12,320
went viral on twitter and i actually
 

4999
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:14,149
went viral on twitter and i actually
looked at that video and based i used

5000
01:29:14,149 --> 01:29:14,159
looked at that video and based i used
 

5001
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:16,790
looked at that video and based i used
the same techniques that fermi used to

5002
01:29:16,790 --> 01:29:16,800
the same techniques that fermi used to
 

5003
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:19,510
the same techniques that fermi used to
calculate the energy of the explosion uh

5004
01:29:19,510 --> 01:29:19,520
calculate the energy of the explosion uh
 

5005
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,350
calculate the energy of the explosion uh
based on the displacement of the dress

5006
01:29:21,350 --> 01:29:21,360
based on the displacement of the dress
 

5007
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:23,030
based on the displacement of the dress
and you could actually see where where

5008
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:23,040
and you could actually see where where
 

5009
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:25,030
and you could actually see where where
she was at the the distance from the

5010
01:29:25,030 --> 01:29:25,040
she was at the the distance from the
 

5011
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:26,470
she was at the the distance from the
explosion because there was a store

5012
01:29:26,470 --> 01:29:26,480
explosion because there was a store
 

5013
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:27,910
explosion because there was a store
behind her and you could look the name

5014
01:29:27,910 --> 01:29:27,920
behind her and you could look the name
 

5015
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:30,229
behind her and you could look the name
of the store and and so i calculated

5016
01:29:30,229 --> 01:29:30,239
of the store and and so i calculated
 

5017
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:31,830
of the store and and so i calculated
that it was the distance and then you

5018
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:31,840
that it was the distance and then you
 

5019
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:33,990
that it was the distance and then you
can then based on the distance where she

5020
01:29:33,990 --> 01:29:34,000
can then based on the distance where she
 

5021
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,310
can then based on the distance where she
was from the the explosion and also on

5022
01:29:36,310 --> 01:29:36,320
was from the the explosion and also on
 

5023
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:38,390
was from the the explosion and also on
the the displacement of the dress like

5024
01:29:38,390 --> 01:29:38,400
the the displacement of the dress like
 

5025
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,070
the the displacement of the dress like
because you can when the blast happens

5026
01:29:40,070 --> 01:29:40,080
because you can when the blast happens
 

5027
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:42,149
because you can when the blast happens
like you can see the dress going back

5028
01:29:42,149 --> 01:29:42,159
like you can see the dress going back
 

5029
01:29:42,159 --> 01:29:43,750
like you can see the dress going back
and then

5030
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:43,760
and then
 

5031
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,430
and then
going back to the original position and

5032
01:29:45,430 --> 01:29:45,440
going back to the original position and
 

5033
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:47,830
going back to the original position and
like by just looking at like how much

5034
01:29:47,830 --> 01:29:47,840
like by just looking at like how much
 

5035
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:50,149
like by just looking at like how much
the the dress moved you can

5036
01:29:50,149 --> 01:29:50,159
the the dress moved you can
 

5037
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:52,149
the the dress moved you can
estimate the explo the energy of the

5038
01:29:52,149 --> 01:29:52,159
estimate the explo the energy of the
 

5039
01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:54,390
estimate the explo the energy of the
explosion i assume you published this

5040
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:54,400
explosion i assume you published this
 

5041
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,390
explosion i assume you published this
on twitter it was just a a twitter

5042
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:56,400
on twitter it was just a a twitter
 

5043
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:58,790
on twitter it was just a a twitter
thread uh but it it actually like a lot

5044
01:29:58,790 --> 01:29:58,800
thread uh but it it actually like a lot
 

5045
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,390
thread uh but it it actually like a lot
of people share that and it was picked

5046
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:00,400
of people share that and it was picked
 

5047
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:03,350
of people share that and it was picked
up by a couple of of um news outlets but

5048
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:03,360
up by a couple of of um news outlets but
 

5049
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,590
up by a couple of of um news outlets but
i i was hoping it would be like a formal

5050
01:30:05,590 --> 01:30:05,600
i i was hoping it would be like a formal
 

5051
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,590
i i was hoping it would be like a formal
title and it would be an archive no no

5052
01:30:07,590 --> 01:30:07,600
title and it would be an archive no no
 

5053
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:09,030
title and it would be an archive no no
no no maybe you submitted it just the

5054
01:30:09,030 --> 01:30:09,040
no no maybe you submitted it just the
 

5055
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:10,550
no no maybe you submitted it just the
twitter the twitter thread but it was

5056
01:30:10,550 --> 01:30:10,560
twitter the twitter thread but it was
 

5057
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,070
twitter the twitter thread but it was
interesting because it was exactly the

5058
01:30:12,070 --> 01:30:12,080
interesting because it was exactly the
 

5059
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:15,189
interesting because it was exactly the
same method that fermi used

5060
01:30:15,189 --> 01:30:15,199
same method that fermi used
 

5061
01:30:15,199 --> 01:30:16,709
same method that fermi used
is there something else that jumps to

5062
01:30:16,709 --> 01:30:16,719
is there something else that jumps to
 

5063
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:19,669
is there something else that jumps to
mind like what is there something

5064
01:30:19,669 --> 01:30:19,679
mind like what is there something
 

5065
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:21,270
mind like what is there something
i know like in terms of papers like i

5066
01:30:21,270 --> 01:30:21,280
i know like in terms of papers like i
 

5067
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:23,990
i know like in terms of papers like i
know the bitcoin paper is super popular

5068
01:30:23,990 --> 01:30:24,000
know the bitcoin paper is super popular
 

5069
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,270
know the bitcoin paper is super popular
is there something interesting to be

5070
01:30:25,270 --> 01:30:25,280
is there something interesting to be
 

5071
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:27,430
is there something interesting to be
said about any of the white papers in

5072
01:30:27,430 --> 01:30:27,440
said about any of the white papers in
 

5073
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:29,669
said about any of the white papers in
the cryptocurrency space

5074
01:30:29,669 --> 01:30:29,679
the cryptocurrency space
 

5075
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:30,629
the cryptocurrency space
yeah the

5076
01:30:30,629 --> 01:30:30,639
yeah the
 

5077
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:32,709
yeah the
the bitcoin paper was the first paper

5078
01:30:32,709 --> 01:30:32,719
the bitcoin paper was the first paper
 

5079
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:35,990
the bitcoin paper was the first paper
that we put on for mods and uh why why

5080
01:30:35,990 --> 01:30:36,000
that we put on for mods and uh why why
 

5081
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,709
that we put on for mods and uh why why
that why that choice as the first paper

5082
01:30:38,709 --> 01:30:38,719
that why that choice as the first paper
 

5083
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:40,950
that why that choice as the first paper
this was a while ago and it was one of

5084
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:40,960
this was a while ago and it was one of
 

5085
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:44,070
this was a while ago and it was one of
the papers that i read and then

5086
01:30:44,070 --> 01:30:44,080
the papers that i read and then
 

5087
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:46,470
the papers that i read and then
and then kind of explained it to to

5088
01:30:46,470 --> 01:30:46,480
and then kind of explained it to to
 

5089
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:48,229
and then kind of explained it to to
louisiana or to other friends that do

5090
01:30:48,229 --> 01:30:48,239
louisiana or to other friends that do
 

5091
01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:49,830
louisiana or to other friends that do
this journal club with us

5092
01:30:49,830 --> 01:30:49,840
this journal club with us
 

5093
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:51,270
this journal club with us
and um

5094
01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:51,280
and um
 

5095
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:54,149
and um
i did some research in cryptography uh

5096
01:30:54,149 --> 01:30:54,159
i did some research in cryptography uh
 

5097
01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:56,310
i did some research in cryptography uh
as an undergrad and so it was a topic

5098
01:30:56,310 --> 01:30:56,320
as an undergrad and so it was a topic
 

5099
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:58,870
as an undergrad and so it was a topic
that i was interested in um but even for

5100
01:30:58,870 --> 01:30:58,880
that i was interested in um but even for
 

5101
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,550
that i was interested in um but even for
me that i i had

5102
01:31:00,550 --> 01:31:00,560
me that i i had
 

5103
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:02,390
me that i i had
that background but

5104
01:31:02,390 --> 01:31:02,400
that background but
 

5105
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:04,629
that background but
reading the bitcoin paper

5106
01:31:04,629 --> 01:31:04,639
reading the bitcoin paper
 

5107
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:06,629
reading the bitcoin paper
it took me a few weeks to really kind of

5108
01:31:06,629 --> 01:31:06,639
it took me a few weeks to really kind of
 

5109
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:08,709
it took me a few weeks to really kind of
wrap my head around it it's it's right

5110
01:31:08,709 --> 01:31:08,719
wrap my head around it it's it's right
 

5111
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:11,430
wrap my head around it it's it's right
it's it uses very spartan precise

5112
01:31:11,430 --> 01:31:11,440
it's it uses very spartan precise
 

5113
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,430
it's it uses very spartan precise
language in a way it's like you feel

5114
01:31:13,430 --> 01:31:13,440
language in a way it's like you feel
 

5115
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:15,430
language in a way it's like you feel
like you can't take any word out of it

5116
01:31:15,430 --> 01:31:15,440
like you can't take any word out of it
 

5117
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:17,910
like you can't take any word out of it
without something falling apart

5118
01:31:17,910 --> 01:31:17,920
without something falling apart
 

5119
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:19,910
without something falling apart
and uh and it's all there i think it's a

5120
01:31:19,910 --> 01:31:19,920
and uh and it's all there i think it's a
 

5121
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:23,350
and uh and it's all there i think it's a
beautiful paper and it's it's it's

5122
01:31:23,350 --> 01:31:23,360
beautiful paper and it's it's it's
 

5123
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:26,229
beautiful paper and it's it's it's
very well written of course but

5124
01:31:26,229 --> 01:31:26,239
very well written of course but
 

5125
01:31:26,239 --> 01:31:27,110
very well written of course but
um

5126
01:31:27,110 --> 01:31:27,120
um
 

5127
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:28,550
um
you know we wanted to try to make it

5128
01:31:28,550 --> 01:31:28,560
you know we wanted to try to make it
 

5129
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:31,350
you know we wanted to try to make it
accessible so that anybody that maybe is

5130
01:31:31,350 --> 01:31:31,360
accessible so that anybody that maybe is
 

5131
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:32,950
accessible so that anybody that maybe is
an undergrad in computer science could

5132
01:31:32,950 --> 01:31:32,960
an undergrad in computer science could
 

5133
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:36,470
an undergrad in computer science could
go on there and then and and know that

5134
01:31:36,470 --> 01:31:36,480
go on there and then and and know that
 

5135
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,390
go on there and then and and know that
you have all the information

5136
01:31:38,390 --> 01:31:38,400
you have all the information
 

5137
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:39,990
you have all the information
in in that page that you're going to

5138
01:31:39,990 --> 01:31:40,000
in in that page that you're going to
 

5139
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,990
in in that page that you're going to
need to understand the mechanics of

5140
01:31:41,990 --> 01:31:42,000
need to understand the mechanics of
 

5141
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,270
need to understand the mechanics of
bitcoin and so like i explain you know

5142
01:31:45,270 --> 01:31:45,280
bitcoin and so like i explain you know
 

5143
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:47,110
bitcoin and so like i explain you know
the basic uh

5144
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:47,120
the basic uh
 

5145
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:49,510
the basic uh
public key cryptography that you need to

5146
01:31:49,510 --> 01:31:49,520
public key cryptography that you need to
 

5147
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:51,270
public key cryptography that you need to
to know in order to understand it you

5148
01:31:51,270 --> 01:31:51,280
to know in order to understand it you
 

5149
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:53,270
to know in order to understand it you
can explain okay what are the properties

5150
01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:53,280
can explain okay what are the properties
 

5151
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:55,350
can explain okay what are the properties
of a hash function and how they are

5152
01:31:55,350 --> 01:31:55,360
of a hash function and how they are
 

5153
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:58,550
of a hash function and how they are
useful in this context um explain what a

5154
01:31:58,550 --> 01:31:58,560
useful in this context um explain what a
 

5155
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:01,189
useful in this context um explain what a
merkle tree is so a bunch of those basic

5156
01:32:01,189 --> 01:32:01,199
merkle tree is so a bunch of those basic
 

5157
01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:02,709
merkle tree is so a bunch of those basic
concepts that maybe if you're reading it

5158
01:32:02,709 --> 01:32:02,719
concepts that maybe if you're reading it
 

5159
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:04,229
concepts that maybe if you're reading it
for a first time and you're an undergrad

5160
01:32:04,229 --> 01:32:04,239
for a first time and you're an undergrad
 

5161
01:32:04,239 --> 01:32:05,830
for a first time and you're an undergrad
and you know you don't know those terms

5162
01:32:05,830 --> 01:32:05,840
and you know you don't know those terms
 

5163
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:07,510
and you know you don't know those terms
you're going to be you know discouraged

5164
01:32:07,510 --> 01:32:07,520
you're going to be you know discouraged
 

5165
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:09,030
you're going to be you know discouraged
because maybe okay now i have to go and

5166
01:32:09,030 --> 01:32:09,040
because maybe okay now i have to go and
 

5167
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:11,110
because maybe okay now i have to go and
google around until i understand these

5168
01:32:11,110 --> 01:32:11,120
google around until i understand these
 

5169
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:13,669
google around until i understand these
before i can make progress in the paper

5170
01:32:13,669 --> 01:32:13,679
before i can make progress in the paper
 

5171
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:14,550
before i can make progress in the paper
um

5172
01:32:14,550 --> 01:32:14,560
um
 

5173
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,310
um
and and this way it's all there you know

5174
01:32:16,310 --> 01:32:16,320
and and this way it's all there you know
 

5175
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:17,669
and and this way it's all there you know
so so there's a

5176
01:32:17,669 --> 01:32:17,679
so so there's a
 

5177
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:18,950
so so there's a
magic to

5178
01:32:18,950 --> 01:32:18,960
magic to
 

5179
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:21,189
magic to
also to the fact that over time more

5180
01:32:21,189 --> 01:32:21,199
also to the fact that over time more
 

5181
01:32:21,199 --> 01:32:23,510
also to the fact that over time more
people went on there and and added

5182
01:32:23,510 --> 01:32:23,520
people went on there and and added
 

5183
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:25,430
people went on there and and added
further annotations so the idea that the

5184
01:32:25,430 --> 01:32:25,440
further annotations so the idea that the
 

5185
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:28,390
further annotations so the idea that the
paper gets easier and more accessible

5186
01:32:28,390 --> 01:32:28,400
paper gets easier and more accessible
 

5187
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,070
paper gets easier and more accessible
over time but that's still you're still

5188
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:30,080
over time but that's still you're still
 

5189
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,550
over time but that's still you're still

looking at the original content the way
 

5191
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:33,270
looking at the original content the way
the

5192
01:32:33,270 --> 01:32:33,280
the
 

5193
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:34,470
the
the author

5194
01:32:34,470 --> 01:32:34,480
the author
 

5195
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:36,550
the author
intended it to be uh but there's just

5196
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:36,560
intended it to be uh but there's just
 

5197
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:39,030
intended it to be uh but there's just
more context and the toughest bits have

5198
01:32:39,030 --> 01:32:39,040
more context and the toughest bits have
 

5199
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,390
more context and the toughest bits have
have

5200
01:32:40,390 --> 01:32:40,400
have
 

5201
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,870
have
more in-depth explanations

5202
01:32:42,870 --> 01:32:42,880
more in-depth explanations
 

5203
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:45,430
more in-depth explanations
okay i think like there's a there's so

5204
01:32:45,430 --> 01:32:45,440
okay i think like there's a there's so
 

5205
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:48,390
okay i think like there's a there's so
many interesting papers uh there like

5206
01:32:48,390 --> 01:32:48,400
many interesting papers uh there like
 

5207
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,709
many interesting papers uh there like
i remember reading the paper that was

5208
01:32:50,709 --> 01:32:50,719
i remember reading the paper that was
 

5209
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:53,030
i remember reading the paper that was
written by freeman dyson on the

5210
01:32:53,030 --> 01:32:53,040
written by freeman dyson on the
 

5211
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:54,950
written by freeman dyson on the
like the the first time that he

5212
01:32:54,950 --> 01:32:54,960
like the the first time that he
 

5213
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:57,270
like the the first time that he
explained or he came up with the concept

5214
01:32:57,270 --> 01:32:57,280
explained or he came up with the concept
 

5215
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:59,990
explained or he came up with the concept
of the dyson sphere and he he put that

5216
01:32:59,990 --> 01:33:00,000
of the dyson sphere and he he put that
 

5217
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,709
of the dyson sphere and he he put that
out like it's again it's one page paper

5218
01:33:02,709 --> 01:33:02,719
out like it's again it's one page paper
 

5219
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:05,430
out like it's again it's one page paper
um and he what he explained was that

5220
01:33:05,430 --> 01:33:05,440
um and he what he explained was that
 

5221
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:08,870
um and he what he explained was that
eventually if a civilization develops

5222
01:33:08,870 --> 01:33:08,880
eventually if a civilization develops
 

5223
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:10,709
eventually if a civilization develops
and and grows there's going to be a

5224
01:33:10,709 --> 01:33:10,719
and and grows there's going to be a
 

5225
01:33:10,719 --> 01:33:13,669
and and grows there's going to be a
point where when the resources on the

5226
01:33:13,669 --> 01:33:13,679
point where when the resources on the
 

5227
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:16,390
point where when the resources on the
planet are not are not enough for the

5228
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:16,400
planet are not are not enough for the
 

5229
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,550
planet are not are not enough for the
energy requirements of that civilization

5230
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:18,560
energy requirements of that civilization
 

5231
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:20,229
energy requirements of that civilization
so if you want to go

5232
01:33:20,229 --> 01:33:20,239
so if you want to go
 

5233
01:33:20,239 --> 01:33:21,910
so if you want to go
the next step is you need to go to the

5234
01:33:21,910 --> 01:33:21,920
the next step is you need to go to the
 

5235
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:24,149
the next step is you need to go to the
next star and extract energy from that

5236
01:33:24,149 --> 01:33:24,159
next star and extract energy from that
 

5237
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:25,030
next star and extract energy from that
star

5238
01:33:25,030 --> 01:33:25,040
star
 

5239
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:27,030
star
and the way to do it is you need to

5240
01:33:27,030 --> 01:33:27,040
and the way to do it is you need to
 

5241
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:29,669
and the way to do it is you need to
build some sort of cap around the star

5242
01:33:29,669 --> 01:33:29,679
build some sort of cap around the star
 

5243
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:32,390
build some sort of cap around the star
that extracts the energy so he theorized

5244
01:33:32,390 --> 01:33:32,400
that extracts the energy so he theorized
 

5245
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:35,830
that extracts the energy so he theorized
this idea of the the dyson sphere and he

5246
01:33:35,830 --> 01:33:35,840
this idea of the the dyson sphere and he
 

5247
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:37,910
this idea of the the dyson sphere and he
went on to kind of analyze how he would

5248
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:37,920
went on to kind of analyze how he would
 

5249
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:40,470
went on to kind of analyze how he would
build that the stability of that sphere

5250
01:33:40,470 --> 01:33:40,480
build that the stability of that sphere
 

5251
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,310
build that the stability of that sphere
like if something happens if there's

5252
01:33:42,310 --> 01:33:42,320
like if something happens if there's
 

5253
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:44,310
like if something happens if there's
like a small oscillation with that fear

5254
01:33:44,310 --> 01:33:44,320
like a small oscillation with that fear
 

5255
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,950
like a small oscillation with that fear
collapsing to the star or no what what

5256
01:33:46,950 --> 01:33:46,960
collapsing to the star or no what what
 

5257
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:50,310
collapsing to the star or no what what
would happen and even went on to uh kind

5258
01:33:50,310 --> 01:33:50,320
would happen and even went on to uh kind
 

5259
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:53,030
would happen and even went on to uh kind
of say that a good way for us to look

5260
01:33:53,030 --> 01:33:53,040
of say that a good way for us to look
 

5261
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:55,590
of say that a good way for us to look
for signs of intelligent life out there

5262
01:33:55,590 --> 01:33:55,600
for signs of intelligent life out there
 

5263
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:58,390
for signs of intelligent life out there
is to look for signals of these dyson

5264
01:33:58,390 --> 01:33:58,400
is to look for signals of these dyson
 

5265
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,430
is to look for signals of these dyson
spheres

5266
01:33:59,430 --> 01:33:59,440
spheres
 

5267
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:00,950
spheres
and because you know according to the

5268
01:34:00,950 --> 01:34:00,960
and because you know according to the
 

5269
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,870
and because you know according to the
law of second law of thermodynamics like

5270
01:34:02,870 --> 01:34:02,880
law of second law of thermodynamics like
 

5271
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:04,470
law of second law of thermodynamics like
this there's going to be some a lot of

5272
01:34:04,470 --> 01:34:04,480
this there's going to be some a lot of
 

5273
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:06,070
this there's going to be some a lot of
infrared radiation that is going to be

5274
01:34:06,070 --> 01:34:06,080
infrared radiation that is going to be
 

5275
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,990
infrared radiation that is going to be
emitted as a consequence of extracting

5276
01:34:07,990 --> 01:34:08,000
emitted as a consequence of extracting
 

5277
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,709
emitted as a consequence of extracting
energy from the star and we should be

5278
01:34:10,709 --> 01:34:10,719
energy from the star and we should be
 

5279
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:12,790
energy from the star and we should be
able to see those signals of like

5280
01:34:12,790 --> 01:34:12,800
able to see those signals of like
 

5281
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:15,590
able to see those signals of like
infrared if we look at the sky but all

5282
01:34:15,590 --> 01:34:15,600
infrared if we look at the sky but all
 

5283
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,430
infrared if we look at the sky but all
these like from the introduction of the

5284
01:34:17,430 --> 01:34:17,440
these like from the introduction of the
 

5285
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:19,430
these like from the introduction of the
concept like the pro how to build the

5286
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:19,440
concept like the pro how to build the
 

5287
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:21,110
concept like the pro how to build the
dyson sphere the problems of like having

5288
01:34:21,110 --> 01:34:21,120
dyson sphere the problems of like having
 

5289
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:23,590
dyson sphere the problems of like having
a dyson sphere how to detect how that

5290
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:23,600
a dyson sphere how to detect how that
 

5291
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:24,790
a dyson sphere how to detect how that
could be used as a signal for

5292
01:34:24,790 --> 01:34:24,800
could be used as a signal for
 

5293
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:26,470
could be used as a signal for
intelligence like really that's all in

5294
01:34:26,470 --> 01:34:26,480
intelligence like really that's all in
 

5295
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:28,790
intelligence like really that's all in
the paper all in one like one page paper

5296
01:34:28,790 --> 01:34:28,800
the paper all in one like one page paper
 

5297
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:30,310
the paper all in one like one page paper
and it's like it's it's for me it's

5298
01:34:30,310 --> 01:34:30,320
and it's like it's it's for me it's
 

5299
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:31,669
and it's like it's it's for me it's
beautiful it's like where was this

5300
01:34:31,669 --> 01:34:31,679
beautiful it's like where was this
 

5301
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:34,229
beautiful it's like where was this
published i don't remember it

5302
01:34:34,229 --> 01:34:34,239
published i don't remember it
 

5303
01:34:34,239 --> 01:34:35,910
published i don't remember it
it's fascinating that papers like that

5304
01:34:35,910 --> 01:34:35,920
it's fascinating that papers like that
 

5305
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,110
it's fascinating that papers like that
could be

5306
01:34:37,110 --> 01:34:37,120
could be
 

5307
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:39,270
could be
yeah i mean the guts it takes

5308
01:34:39,270 --> 01:34:39,280
yeah i mean the guts it takes
 

5309
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:42,229
yeah i mean the guts it takes
to put that all together in a paper you

5310
01:34:42,229 --> 01:34:42,239
to put that all together in a paper you
 

5311
01:34:42,239 --> 01:34:43,910
to put that all together in a paper you
know that that kind of challenges our

5312
01:34:43,910 --> 01:34:43,920
know that that kind of challenges our
 

5313
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:46,470
know that that kind of challenges our
previous discussion that of paper i mean

5314
01:34:46,470 --> 01:34:46,480
previous discussion that of paper i mean
 

5315
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,470
previous discussion that of paper i mean
papers can be beautiful you can play

5316
01:34:48,470 --> 01:34:48,480
papers can be beautiful you can play
 

5317
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:50,470
papers can be beautiful you can play
with the format right it

5318
01:34:50,470 --> 01:34:50,480
with the format right it
 

5319
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:52,470
with the format right it
but there's a lot to unpack there that's

5320
01:34:52,470 --> 01:34:52,480
but there's a lot to unpack there that's
 

5321
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,550
but there's a lot to unpack there that's
like the the that's the the starting

5322
01:34:54,550 --> 01:34:54,560
like the the that's the the starting
 

5323
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:56,470
like the the that's the the starting
point but it's it's it's beautiful that

5324
01:34:56,470 --> 01:34:56,480
point but it's it's it's beautiful that
 

5325
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:59,109
point but it's it's it's beautiful that
you're able to put that in one page

5326
01:34:59,109 --> 01:34:59,119
you're able to put that in one page
 

5327
01:34:59,119 --> 01:35:01,430
you're able to put that in one page
and then people can build on top of that

5328
01:35:01,430 --> 01:35:01,440
and then people can build on top of that
 

5329
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:03,270
and then people can build on top of that
and but the key ideas are there yeah

5330
01:35:03,270 --> 01:35:03,280
and but the key ideas are there yeah
 

5331
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:04,629
and but the key ideas are there yeah
exactly

5332
01:35:04,629 --> 01:35:04,639
exactly
 

5333
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:07,270
exactly
what about have you looked at any of the

5334
01:35:07,270 --> 01:35:07,280
what about have you looked at any of the
 

5335
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:08,950
what about have you looked at any of the
the big seminal papers throughout the

5336
01:35:08,950 --> 01:35:08,960
the big seminal papers throughout the
 

5337
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:10,470
the big seminal papers throughout the
history of science like you look at

5338
01:35:10,470 --> 01:35:10,480
history of science like you look at
 

5339
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:14,149
history of science like you look at
simple like einstein papers

5340
01:35:14,149 --> 01:35:14,159
simple like einstein papers
 

5341
01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:15,990
simple like einstein papers
have any of those been annotated yeah

5342
01:35:15,990 --> 01:35:16,000
have any of those been annotated yeah
 

5343
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,229
have any of those been annotated yeah
yeah no we we have some more seminal

5344
01:35:18,229 --> 01:35:18,239
yeah no we we have some more seminal
 

5345
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:19,830
yeah no we we have some more seminal
papers that

5346
01:35:19,830 --> 01:35:19,840
papers that
 

5347
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,910
papers that
that people will have heard about um you

5348
01:35:21,910 --> 01:35:21,920
that people will have heard about um you
 

5349
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:23,270
that people will have heard about um you
know we have the

5350
01:35:23,270 --> 01:35:23,280
know we have the
 

5351
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:26,790
know we have the
the dna double helix paper on there

5352
01:35:26,790 --> 01:35:26,800
the dna double helix paper on there
 

5353
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:29,669
the dna double helix paper on there
we have the higgs boson

5354
01:35:29,669 --> 01:35:29,679
we have the higgs boson
 

5355
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:30,629
we have the higgs boson
paper

5356
01:35:30,629 --> 01:35:30,639
paper
 

5357
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:34,470
paper
um yeah there's papers that that we know

5358
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:34,480
um yeah there's papers that that we know
 

5359
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:35,750
um yeah there's papers that that we know
that it's

5360
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:35,760
that it's
 

5361
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:37,510
that it's
they're not going to be finding out

5362
01:35:37,510 --> 01:35:37,520
they're not going to be finding out
 

5363
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:40,310
they're not going to be finding out
about them because of us but it's papers

5364
01:35:40,310 --> 01:35:40,320
about them because of us but it's papers
 

5365
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:42,149
about them because of us but it's papers
that we think

5366
01:35:42,149 --> 01:35:42,159
that we think
 

5367
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:43,990
that we think
should be more widely read and that

5368
01:35:43,990 --> 01:35:44,000
should be more widely read and that
 

5369
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,070
should be more widely read and that
folks would benefit from having some

5370
01:35:46,070 --> 01:35:46,080
folks would benefit from having some
 

5371
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:48,149
folks would benefit from having some
annotations there and so we also have a

5372
01:35:48,149 --> 01:35:48,159
annotations there and so we also have a
 

5373
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:50,229
annotations there and so we also have a
number of those a lot of like discovery

5374
01:35:50,229 --> 01:35:50,239
number of those a lot of like discovery
 

5375
01:35:50,239 --> 01:35:52,550
number of those a lot of like discovery
papers for fundamental like particles

5376
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:52,560
papers for fundamental like particles
 

5377
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:54,550
papers for fundamental like particles
and all that there's we have a lot of

5378
01:35:54,550 --> 01:35:54,560
and all that there's we have a lot of
 

5379
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:56,470
and all that there's we have a lot of
those on from us library

5380
01:35:56,470 --> 01:35:56,480
those on from us library
 

5381
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:58,470
those on from us library
um yeah we i would like to end we

5382
01:35:58,470 --> 01:35:58,480
um yeah we i would like to end we
 

5383
01:35:58,480 --> 01:35:59,990
um yeah we i would like to end we
haven't annotated that one but i'd like

5384
01:35:59,990 --> 01:36:00,000
haven't annotated that one but i'd like
 

5385
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,709
haven't annotated that one but i'd like
to on the riemann hypotheses that's a

5386
01:36:02,709 --> 01:36:02,719
to on the riemann hypotheses that's a
 

5387
01:36:02,719 --> 01:36:05,270
to on the riemann hypotheses that's a
really interesting paper as well um and

5388
01:36:05,270 --> 01:36:05,280
really interesting paper as well um and
 

5389
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:07,270
really interesting paper as well um and
and but we haven't annotated that one

5390
01:36:07,270 --> 01:36:07,280
and but we haven't annotated that one
 

5391
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:08,870
and but we haven't annotated that one
but there's a lot of like more

5392
01:36:08,870 --> 01:36:08,880
but there's a lot of like more
 

5393
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:11,189
but there's a lot of like more
historical landmark papers

5394
01:36:11,189 --> 01:36:11,199
historical landmark papers
 

5395
01:36:11,199 --> 01:36:14,310
historical landmark papers
um on the platform have you done uh

5396
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:14,320
um on the platform have you done uh
 

5397
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:16,470
um on the platform have you done uh
point correct conjecture with uh with

5398
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:16,480
point correct conjecture with uh with
 

5399
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:18,629
point correct conjecture with uh with
perlman that's too much that's too much

5400
01:36:18,629 --> 01:36:18,639
perlman that's too much that's too much
 

5401
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:20,950
perlman that's too much that's too much
that's too much too much for me but it's

5402
01:36:20,950 --> 01:36:20,960
that's too much too much for me but it's
 

5403
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:21,750
that's too much too much for me but it's
uh

5404
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:21,760
uh
 

5405
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:23,750
uh
it's it's interesting that you know and

5406
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:23,760
it's it's interesting that you know and
 

5407
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:25,350
it's it's interesting that you know and
going back to our discussion like the

5408
01:36:25,350 --> 01:36:25,360
going back to our discussion like the
 

5409
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:27,510
going back to our discussion like the
the poincare paper was like published on

5410
01:36:27,510 --> 01:36:27,520
the poincare paper was like published on
 

5411
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,830
the poincare paper was like published on
archive and and it was not on a journal

5412
01:36:29,830 --> 01:36:29,840
archive and and it was not on a journal
 

5413
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:31,510
archive and and it was not on a journal
like the three papers and yeah what do

5414
01:36:31,510 --> 01:36:31,520
like the three papers and yeah what do
 

5415
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:33,350
like the three papers and yeah what do
you make of that i mean he's such a

5416
01:36:33,350 --> 01:36:33,360
you make of that i mean he's such a
 

5417
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:34,950
you make of that i mean he's such a
fascinating human being exactly i

5418
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:34,960
fascinating human being exactly i
 

5419
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:36,310
fascinating human being exactly i
mentioned to you offline that i'm going

5420
01:36:36,310 --> 01:36:36,320
mentioned to you offline that i'm going
 

5421
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:38,470
mentioned to you offline that i'm going
to russia he's somebody i'm

5422
01:36:38,470 --> 01:36:38,480
to russia he's somebody i'm
 

5423
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:41,990
to russia he's somebody i'm
really trying to interview yeah well

5424
01:36:41,990 --> 01:36:42,000

people started jumping on that reading
 

5679
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:09,830
people started jumping on that reading
those papers and there was like a lot of

took paramount pearlman's work they
 

5691
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:21,350
took paramount pearlman's work they
sanded some of the edges and they

those like researchers uh when they
 

5733
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,510
those like researchers uh when they
published after paramount there were

01:42:09,109 --> 01:42:09,119
parliament did all the really hard work
 

5741
01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:10,310
parliament did all the really hard work
and so

5742
01:42:10,310 --> 01:42:10,320
and so
 

5743
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:12,709
and so
just just the fact that they doubted

5744
01:42:12,709 --> 01:42:12,719
just just the fact that they doubted
 

5745
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:15,030
just just the fact that they doubted
that pearman had done that like was

5746
01:42:15,030 --> 01:42:15,040
that pearman had done that like was
 

5747
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,870
that pearman had done that like was
enough for him to say i'm not i'm not

5748
01:42:16,870 --> 01:42:16,880
enough for him to say i'm not i'm not
 

5749
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:18,870
enough for him to say i'm not i'm not
interested in this prize and that was

5750
01:42:18,870 --> 01:42:18,880
interested in this prize and that was
 

5751
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,709
interested in this prize and that was
one of the reasons why he rejected the

5752
01:42:20,709 --> 01:42:20,719
one of the reasons why he rejected the
 

5753
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:22,950
one of the reasons why he rejected the
fields medal it then you also rejected

5754
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:22,960
fields medal it then you also rejected
 

5755
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:25,910
fields medal it then you also rejected
the clay prize so the poincare

5756
01:42:25,910 --> 01:42:25,920
the clay prize so the poincare
 

5757
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:27,669
the clay prize so the poincare
conjecture was one of the millennium

5758
01:42:27,669 --> 01:42:27,679
conjecture was one of the millennium
 

5759
01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:29,669
conjecture was one of the millennium
prices there was a million dollar prize

5760
01:42:29,669 --> 01:42:29,679
prices there was a million dollar prize
 

5761
01:42:29,679 --> 01:42:31,669
prices there was a million dollar prize
associated with that problem and that

5762
01:42:31,669 --> 01:42:31,679
associated with that problem and that
 

5763
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:33,830
associated with that problem and that
has to have to do with the fact that for

5764
01:42:33,830 --> 01:42:33,840
has to have to do with the fact that for
 

5765
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:35,910
has to have to do with the fact that for
them to attribute that price i think it

5766
01:42:35,910 --> 01:42:35,920
them to attribute that price i think it
 

5767
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:38,470
them to attribute that price i think it
had to be published on a journal yes the

5768
01:42:38,470 --> 01:42:38,480
had to be published on a journal yes the
 

5769
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:40,310
had to be published on a journal yes the
proof and again

5770
01:42:40,310 --> 01:42:40,320
proof and again
 

5771
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:42,550
proof and again
paramount principles of

5772
01:42:42,550 --> 01:42:42,560
paramount principles of
 

5773
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:44,629
paramount principles of
like interfered here and and he also

5774
01:42:44,629 --> 01:42:44,639
like interfered here and and he also
 

5775
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:46,070
like interfered here and and he also
just didn't care about the money he's

5776
01:42:46,070 --> 01:42:46,080
just didn't care about the money he's
 

5777
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:48,790
just didn't care about the money he's
like um clay i think was a businessman

5778
01:42:48,790 --> 01:42:48,800
like um clay i think was a businessman
 

5779
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:50,310
like um clay i think was a businessman
and he's like doesn't have to do

5780
01:42:50,310 --> 01:42:50,320
and he's like doesn't have to do
 

5781
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:51,990
and he's like doesn't have to do
anything with with mathematics i don't

5782
01:42:51,990 --> 01:42:52,000
anything with with mathematics i don't
 

5783
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,910
anything with with mathematics i don't
care about these like um

5784
01:42:53,910 --> 01:42:53,920
care about these like um
 

5785
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:55,270
care about these like um
that's one of the reasons why we

5786
01:42:55,270 --> 01:42:55,280
that's one of the reasons why we
 

5787
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:57,270
that's one of the reasons why we
rejected that yeah there's

5788
01:42:57,270 --> 01:42:57,280
rejected that yeah there's
 

5789
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:00,070
rejected that yeah there's
it's hard to convert into words but

5790
01:43:00,070 --> 01:43:00,080
it's hard to convert into words but
 

5791
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:03,109
it's hard to convert into words but
at mit i'm

5792
01:43:03,109 --> 01:43:03,119
at mit i'm
 

5793
01:43:03,119 --> 01:43:05,430
at mit i'm
distinctly aware of the distinction

5794
01:43:05,430 --> 01:43:05,440
distinctly aware of the distinction

versus
what that music sounds like when we're

5806

uh
and i think that's probably what

5838
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:50,000
and i think that's probably what
 

5839
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,990
and i think that's probably what
prominent is as well like the moment he

5840
01:43:51,990 --> 01:43:52,000
prominent is as well like the moment he
 

5841
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,229
prominent is as well like the moment he
senses there's any as with a feels

5842
01:43:54,229 --> 01:43:54,239
senses there's any as with a feels
 

5843
01:43:54,239 --> 01:43:56,310
senses there's any as with a feels
matter like the moment you start

5844
01:43:56,310 --> 01:43:56,320
matter like the moment you start
 

5845
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:59,430
matter like the moment you start
to have any kind of drama around credit

5846
01:43:59,430 --> 01:43:59,440
to have any kind of drama around credit
 

5847
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:01,830
to have any kind of drama around credit
assignment all those kinds of things

5848
01:44:01,830 --> 01:44:01,840
assignment all those kinds of things
 

5849
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:03,430
assignment all those kinds of things
it's almost not that it's important who

5850
01:44:03,430 --> 01:44:03,440
it's almost not that it's important who
 

5851
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:05,430
it's almost not that it's important who
gets the credit it's like the drama in

5852
01:44:05,430 --> 01:44:05,440
gets the credit it's like the drama in
 

5853
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:06,950
gets the credit it's like the drama in
itself gets in the way of the

5854
01:44:06,950 --> 01:44:06,960
itself gets in the way of the
 

5855
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:08,709
itself gets in the way of the
exploration of the ideas or the

5856
01:44:08,709 --> 01:44:08,719
exploration of the ideas or the
 

5857
01:44:08,719 --> 01:44:11,510
exploration of the ideas or the
fundamental thing that makes science

5858
01:44:11,510 --> 01:44:11,520
fundamental thing that makes science
 

5859
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:13,350
fundamental thing that makes science
so damn beautiful and and you can really

5860
01:44:13,350 --> 01:44:13,360
so damn beautiful and and you can really
 

5861
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:15,189
so damn beautiful and and you can really
see that there's also a product of that

5862
01:44:15,189 --> 01:44:15,199
see that there's also a product of that
 

5863
01:44:15,199 --> 01:44:18,390
see that there's also a product of that
russian school of like doing science

5864
01:44:18,390 --> 01:44:18,400
russian school of like doing science
 

5865
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:20,790
russian school of like doing science
and you can see that that um

5866
01:44:20,790 --> 01:44:20,800
and you can see that that um
 

5867
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:23,109
and you can see that that um
that people were you know during the

5868
01:44:23,109 --> 01:44:23,119
that people were you know during the
 

5869
01:44:23,119 --> 01:44:24,790
that people were you know during the
cold war a lot of mathematicians they

5870
01:44:24,790 --> 01:44:24,800
cold war a lot of mathematicians they
 

5871
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:26,870
cold war a lot of mathematicians they
were not making any money they were

5872
01:44:26,870 --> 01:44:26,880
were not making any money they were
 

5873
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:29,350
were not making any money they were
doing math for the sake of math

5874
01:44:29,350 --> 01:44:29,360
doing math for the sake of math
 

5875
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:31,189
doing math for the sake of math
like for the intellectual

5876
01:44:31,189 --> 01:44:31,199
like for the intellectual
 

5877
01:44:31,199 --> 01:44:33,270
like for the intellectual
pleasure of like solving a difficult

5878
01:44:33,270 --> 01:44:33,280
pleasure of like solving a difficult
 

5879
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:35,510
pleasure of like solving a difficult
problem yeah and you know even even if

5880
01:44:35,510 --> 01:44:35,520
problem yeah and you know even even if
 

5881
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:37,109
problem yeah and you know even even if
it was a flawed system and there were a

5882
01:44:37,109 --> 01:44:37,119
it was a flawed system and there were a
 

5883
01:44:37,119 --> 01:44:39,030
it was a flawed system and there were a
lot of problems with with that

5884
01:44:39,030 --> 01:44:39,040
lot of problems with with that
 

5885
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:41,270
lot of problems with with that
there's these they were able to to

5886
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:41,280
there's these they were able to to
 

5887
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:43,189
there's these they were able to to
actually achieve these and uh there were

5888
01:44:43,189 --> 01:44:43,199
actually achieve these and uh there were
 

5889
01:44:43,199 --> 01:44:45,270
actually achieve these and uh there were
a lot of imperiment for me is the

5890
01:44:45,270 --> 01:44:45,280
a lot of imperiment for me is the
 

5891
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:47,270
a lot of imperiment for me is the
perfect product of that it just cared

5892
01:44:47,270 --> 01:44:47,280
perfect product of that it just cared
 

5893
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:49,910
perfect product of that it just cared
about like working on tough problems he

5894
01:44:49,910 --> 01:44:49,920
about like working on tough problems he
 

5895
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,430
about like working on tough problems he
didn't care about anything else it was

5896
01:44:51,430 --> 01:44:51,440
didn't care about anything else it was
 

5897
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:53,109
didn't care about anything else it was
just math

5898
01:44:53,109 --> 01:44:53,119
just math
 

5899
01:44:53,119 --> 01:44:55,910

01:47:51,590 --> 01:47:51,600
that he decided that
 

6063
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:53,990
that he decided that
one of the ways that he could have

6064
01:47:53,990 --> 01:47:54,000
one of the ways that he could have
 

6065
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,030
one of the ways that he could have
could have

6066
01:47:55,030 --> 01:47:55,040
could have
 

6067
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:57,189
could have
you know the biggest leverage kind of is

6068
01:47:57,189 --> 01:47:57,199
you know the biggest leverage kind of is
 

6069
01:47:57,199 --> 01:47:59,189
you know the biggest leverage kind of is
in pushing science in the direction that

6070
01:47:59,189 --> 01:47:59,199
in pushing science in the direction that
 

6071
01:47:59,199 --> 01:48:00,229
in pushing science in the direction that
he thinks

6072
01:48:00,229 --> 01:48:00,239
he thinks
 

6073
01:48:00,239 --> 01:48:03,270
he thinks
science should go would be to to try to

6074
01:48:03,270 --> 01:48:03,280
science should go would be to to try to
 

6075
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:05,270
science should go would be to to try to
go into politics and so that's what he

6076
01:48:05,270 --> 01:48:05,280
go into politics and so that's what he
 

6077
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:06,709
go into politics and so that's what he
did and and uh

6078
01:48:06,709 --> 01:48:06,719
did and and uh
 

6079
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:08,950
did and and uh
and the israel i'm not sure if he has

6080
01:48:08,950 --> 01:48:08,960
and the israel i'm not sure if he has
 

6081
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:09,910
and the israel i'm not sure if he has
won

6082
01:48:09,910 --> 01:48:09,920
won
 

6083
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:11,910
won
in any election but i think he's running

6084
01:48:11,910 --> 01:48:11,920
in any election but i think he's running
 

6085
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:12,950
in any election but i think he's running
for a mayor

6086
01:48:12,950 --> 01:48:12,960
for a mayor
 

6087
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:14,870
for a mayor
of paris or something like that but it's

6088
01:48:14,870 --> 01:48:14,880
of paris or something like that but it's
 

6089
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:17,510
of paris or something like that but it's
this brilliant mathematician that

6090
01:48:17,510 --> 01:48:17,520
this brilliant mathematician that
 

6091
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:18,470
this brilliant mathematician that
before

6092
01:48:18,470 --> 01:48:18,480
before
 

6093
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:21,590
before
winning the fields medal had only been

6094
01:48:21,590 --> 01:48:21,600
winning the fields medal had only been
 

6095
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:23,590
winning the fields medal had only been
just a brilliant mathematician but but

6096
01:48:23,590 --> 01:48:23,600
just a brilliant mathematician but but
 

6097
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:25,030
just a brilliant mathematician but but
after that he decided to go into

6098
01:48:25,030 --> 01:48:25,040
after that he decided to go into
 

6099
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:27,350
after that he decided to go into
politics to to try to to have an impact

6100
01:48:27,350 --> 01:48:27,360
politics to to try to to have an impact
 

6101
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:28,790
politics to to try to to have an impact
and try to change some of the things

6102
01:48:28,790 --> 01:48:28,800
and try to change some of the things
 

6103
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:31,669
and try to change some of the things
that he he would complain about before

6104
01:48:31,669 --> 01:48:31,679
that he he would complain about before
 

6105
01:48:31,679 --> 01:48:34,629
that he he would complain about before
so so there's that component

6106
01:48:34,629 --> 01:48:34,639
so so there's that component
 

6107
01:48:34,639 --> 01:48:35,990
so so there's that component
as well

6108
01:48:35,990 --> 01:48:36,000
as well
 

6109
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,669
as well
yeah and i've always thought mathematics

6110
01:48:37,669 --> 01:48:37,679
yeah and i've always thought mathematics
 

6111
01:48:37,679 --> 01:48:40,310
yeah and i've always thought mathematics
and science should be like like james

6112
01:48:40,310 --> 01:48:40,320
and science should be like like james
 

6113
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:42,550
and science should be like like james
bond

6114
01:48:42,550 --> 01:48:42,560
bond
 

6115
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:45,109
bond
would in my eyes i think be sexier if

6116
01:48:45,109 --> 01:48:45,119
would in my eyes i think be sexier if
 

6117
01:48:45,119 --> 01:48:47,910
would in my eyes i think be sexier if
you did math like we should as a society

6118
01:48:47,910 --> 01:48:47,920
you did math like we should as a society
 

6119
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:49,030
you did math like we should as a society
put

6120
01:48:49,030 --> 01:48:49,040
put
 

6121
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:50,950
put
excellence in mathematics

6122
01:48:50,950 --> 01:48:50,960
excellence in mathematics
 

6123
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:52,709
excellence in mathematics
at the same level as being able to kill

6124
01:48:52,709 --> 01:48:52,719
at the same level as being able to kill
 

6125
01:48:52,719 --> 01:48:54,229
at the same level as being able to kill
a man with your bare hands like those

6126
01:48:54,229 --> 01:48:54,239
a man with your bare hands like those
 

6127
01:48:54,239 --> 01:48:56,229
a man with your bare hands like those
are both useful feature like

6128
01:48:56,229 --> 01:48:56,239
are both useful feature like
 

6129
01:48:56,239 --> 01:48:58,629
are both useful feature like
that's admirable it's like oh like that

6130
01:48:58,629 --> 01:48:58,639
that's admirable it's like oh like that
 

6131
01:48:58,639 --> 01:49:00,709
that's admirable it's like oh like that
makes you like that makes the person

6132
01:49:00,709 --> 01:49:00,719
makes you like that makes the person
 

6133
01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:01,830
makes you like that makes the person
interesting

6134
01:49:01,830 --> 01:49:01,840
interesting
 

6135
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:03,750
interesting
like being extremely well read about

6136
01:49:03,750 --> 01:49:03,760
like being extremely well read about
 

6137
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:05,910
like being extremely well read about
history or philosophy being good in

6138
01:49:05,910 --> 01:49:05,920
history or philosophy being good in
 

6139
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,910
history or philosophy being good in
mathematics being able to kill a man

6140
01:49:07,910 --> 01:49:07,920
mathematics being able to kill a man
 

6141
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:09,830
mathematics being able to kill a man
with bare hands those are all the same

6142
01:49:09,830 --> 01:49:09,840
with bare hands those are all the same
 

6143
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:12,390
with bare hands those are all the same
in my book so i think all are useful for

6144
01:49:12,390 --> 01:49:12,400
in my book so i think all are useful for
 

6145
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:13,910
in my book so i think all are useful for
action stars

6146
01:49:13,910 --> 01:49:13,920
action stars
 

6147
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:15,669
action stars
and i think the society will benefit for

6148
01:49:15,669 --> 01:49:15,679
and i think the society will benefit for
 

6149
01:49:15,679 --> 01:49:17,990
and i think the society will benefit for
uh for giving more value to that like

6150
01:49:17,990 --> 01:49:18,000
uh for giving more value to that like
 

6151
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,910
uh for giving more value to that like
one of the things that bothers me about

6152
01:49:19,910 --> 01:49:19,920
one of the things that bothers me about
 

6153
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:22,390
one of the things that bothers me about
american culture

6154
01:49:22,390 --> 01:49:22,400
american culture
 

6155
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:24,629
american culture
is the

6156
01:49:24,629 --> 01:49:24,639
is the
 

6157
01:49:24,639 --> 01:49:26,229
is the
i don't know the right words to use but

6158
01:49:26,229 --> 01:49:26,239
i don't know the right words to use but
 

6159
01:49:26,239 --> 01:49:28,149
i don't know the right words to use but
like the nerdiness associated with

6160
01:49:28,149 --> 01:49:28,159
like the nerdiness associated with
 

6161
01:49:28,159 --> 01:49:29,350
like the nerdiness associated with
science

6162
01:49:29,350 --> 01:49:29,360
science
 

6163
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:30,629
science
like

6164
01:49:30,629 --> 01:49:30,639
like
 

6165
01:49:30,639 --> 01:49:33,910
like
like in i i don't think nerd is a good

6166
01:49:33,910 --> 01:49:33,920
like in i i don't think nerd is a good
 

6167
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:38,390
like in i i don't think nerd is a good
word in in american culture because uh

6168
01:49:38,390 --> 01:49:38,400
word in in american culture because uh
 

6169
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:40,390
word in in american culture because uh
it's seen as like weakness there's like

6170
01:49:40,390 --> 01:49:40,400
it's seen as like weakness there's like
 

6171
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:43,750
it's seen as like weakness there's like
images that come with that and it's fine

6172
01:49:43,750 --> 01:49:43,760
images that come with that and it's fine
 

6173
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:45,990
images that come with that and it's fine
you could you could be all kinds of uh

6174
01:49:45,990 --> 01:49:46,000
you could you could be all kinds of uh
 

6175
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,229
you could you could be all kinds of uh
shapes and colors and personalities but

6176
01:49:48,229 --> 01:49:48,239
shapes and colors and personalities but
 

6177
01:49:48,239 --> 01:49:49,990
shapes and colors and personalities but
like

6178
01:49:49,990 --> 01:49:50,000
like
 

6179
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,030
like
to me

6180
01:49:51,030 --> 01:49:51,040
to me
 

6181
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:53,109
to me
uh having sophisticated knowledge in

6182
01:49:53,109 --> 01:49:53,119
uh having sophisticated knowledge in
 

6183
01:49:53,119 --> 01:49:56,629
uh having sophisticated knowledge in
science being good at math doesn't mean

6184
01:49:56,629 --> 01:49:56,639
science being good at math doesn't mean
 

6185
01:49:56,639 --> 01:49:57,910
science being good at math doesn't mean
you're weak

6186
01:49:57,910 --> 01:49:57,920
you're weak
 

6187
01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:00,470
you're weak
in fact it could be the very opposite

6188
01:50:00,470 --> 01:50:00,480
in fact it could be the very opposite
 

6189
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:02,390
in fact it could be the very opposite
and so it's it's an interesting thing

6190
01:50:02,390 --> 01:50:02,400
and so it's it's an interesting thing
 

6191
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:04,550
and so it's it's an interesting thing
because it was very much differently

6192
01:50:04,550 --> 01:50:04,560
because it was very much differently
 

6193
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:07,750
because it was very much differently
viewed in the uh in the soviet union so

6194
01:50:07,750 --> 01:50:07,760
viewed in the uh in the soviet union so
 

6195
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:09,350
viewed in the uh in the soviet union so
i know for sure

6196
01:50:09,350 --> 01:50:09,360
i know for sure
 

6197
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:11,189
i know for sure
as an existence proof

6198
01:50:11,189 --> 01:50:11,199
as an existence proof
 

6199
01:50:11,199 --> 01:50:13,910
as an existence proof
that it doesn't have to be that way but

6200
01:50:13,910 --> 01:50:13,920
that it doesn't have to be that way but
 

6201
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:15,430
that it doesn't have to be that way but
it um

6202
01:50:15,430 --> 01:50:15,440
it um
 

6203
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:17,510
it um
i also feel like we lack a lot of

6204
01:50:17,510 --> 01:50:17,520
i also feel like we lack a lot of
 

6205
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:19,189
i also feel like we lack a lot of
like role models in terms if you ask

6206
01:50:19,189 --> 01:50:19,199
like role models in terms if you ask
 

6207
01:50:19,199 --> 01:50:20,470
like role models in terms if you ask
people like

6208
01:50:20,470 --> 01:50:20,480
people like
 

6209
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:21,430
people like
mention

6210
01:50:21,430 --> 01:50:21,440
mention
 

6211
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:23,430
mention
to mention one mathematician that they

6212
01:50:23,430 --> 01:50:23,440
to mention one mathematician that they
 

6213
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:25,430
to mention one mathematician that they
know that is alive today i think a lot

6214
01:50:25,430 --> 01:50:25,440
know that is alive today i think a lot
 

6215
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:27,189
know that is alive today i think a lot
of people would struggle

6216
01:50:27,189 --> 01:50:27,199
of people would struggle
 

6217
01:50:27,199 --> 01:50:29,750
of people would struggle
to answer that question um

6218
01:50:29,750 --> 01:50:29,760
to answer that question um
 

6219
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:31,589
to answer that question um
and i also think

6220
01:50:31,589 --> 01:50:31,599
and i also think
 

6221
01:50:31,599 --> 01:50:34,870
and i also think
i love neil degrasse tyson okay

6222
01:50:34,870 --> 01:50:34,880
i love neil degrasse tyson okay
 

6223
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:36,790
i love neil degrasse tyson okay
but

6224

a problem on an erdos problem actually
 

6333
01:52:36,239 --> 01:52:38,790
a problem on an erdos problem actually
so if paul erdogan was this

6334
01:52:38,790 --> 01:52:38,800
so if paul erdogan was this
 

6335
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:41,669
so if paul erdogan was this
mathematician from hungary and it was

the airdosh
 

6341
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:45,910
the airdosh
for a lot of things but one of the

6342
01:52:45,910 --> 01:52:45,920
for a lot of things but one of the
 

6343

things that he was also known was for
 

6345
01:52:47,119 --> 01:52:49,750
things that he was also known was for
the erdos problem so he was always like

6346
01:52:49,750 --> 01:52:49,760
the erdos problem so he was always like
 

6347
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:51,910
the erdos problem so he was always like
um creating these problems and usually

6348
01:52:51,910 --> 01:52:51,920
um creating these problems and usually
 

6349
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:53,910
um creating these problems and usually
associating prizes with those problems

6350
01:52:53,910 --> 01:52:53,920
associating prizes with those problems
 

6351
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:55,510
associating prizes with those problems
and a lot of those problems are still

6352
01:52:55,510 --> 01:52:55,520
and a lot of those problems are still
 

6353
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:57,830
and a lot of those problems are still
open like and and there will be some of

6354
01:52:57,830 --> 01:52:57,840
open like and and there will be some of
 

6355
01:52:57,840 --> 01:52:59,990
open like and and there will be some of
them will be open for like maybe

6356
01:52:59,990 --> 01:53:00,000
them will be open for like maybe
 

6357
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,669
them will be open for like maybe
a couple hundred years and i think

6358
01:53:01,669 --> 01:53:01,679
a couple hundred years and i think
 

6359
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:03,430
a couple hundred years and i think
that's actually an interesting hack for

6360
01:53:03,430 --> 01:53:03,440
that's actually an interesting hack for
 

6361
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:05,109
that's actually an interesting hack for
him to collaborate with future

6362
01:53:05,109 --> 01:53:05,119
him to collaborate with future
 

6363
01:53:05,119 --> 01:53:07,430
him to collaborate with future
mathematicians you know his his name

6364
01:53:07,430 --> 01:53:07,440
mathematicians you know his his name
 

6365
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:09,830
mathematicians you know his his name
will will keep coming up in you know for

will will keep coming up in you know for
 

6367
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:11,910
will will keep coming up in you know for
future generations but so tao was

6368
01:53:11,910 --> 01:53:11,920
future generations but so tao was
 

6369
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:13,589
future generations but so tao was
working on one of these problems called

6370
01:53:13,589 --> 01:53:13,599
working on one of these problems called
 

6371
01:53:13,599 --> 01:53:16,310
working on one of these problems called
the erdog discrepancy and he published a

6372
01:53:16,310 --> 01:53:16,320
the erdog discrepancy and he published a
 

6373
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:18,229
the erdog discrepancy and he published a
blog post on like

6374

01:53:30,870 --> 01:53:30,880
on his blog post saying okay like
 

6385
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:31,990
on his blog post saying okay like
some of the

6386
01:53:31,990 --> 01:53:32,000
some of the
 

6387
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,229
some of the
so this problem is like a sudoku like

6388
01:53:34,229 --> 01:53:34,239
so this problem is like a sudoku like
 

6389
01:53:34,239 --> 01:53:35,750
so this problem is like a sudoku like
flavor and some of the machinery that

6390
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:35,760
flavor and some of the machinery that
 

6391
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:38,470
flavor and some of the machinery that
we're using to solve the sudoku could be

6392
01:53:38,470 --> 01:53:38,480
we're using to solve the sudoku could be
 

6393
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:40,470
we're using to solve the sudoku could be
used here and that was actually the key

6394
01:53:40,470 --> 01:53:40,480
used here and that was actually the key
 

6395
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:42,149
used here and that was actually the key
to solve their those discrepancy

6396
01:53:42,149 --> 01:53:42,159
to solve their those discrepancy
 

6397
01:53:42,159 --> 01:53:43,910
to solve their those discrepancy
problems so the there was a comment on

6398
01:53:43,910 --> 01:53:43,920
problems so the there was a comment on
 

6399
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:46,070
problems so the there was a comment on
his blog and i think that that that for

6400
01:53:46,070 --> 01:53:46,080
his blog and i think that that that for
 

6401
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:48,310
his blog and i think that that that for
me is an example of like how to do

6402
01:53:48,310 --> 01:53:48,320
me is an example of like how to do
 

6403
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:49,990
me is an example of like how to do

being a a mathematician like and and
 

6415
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:05,109
being a a mathematician like and and
even he wrote about some of the

6416
01:54:05,109 --> 01:54:05,119
even he wrote about some of the
 

6417
01:54:05,119 --> 01:54:07,629

6425
01:54:15,199 --> 01:54:17,109
growing up he was extremely talented in
in mathematics from a young age like

6426
01:54:17,109 --> 01:54:17,119
in mathematics from a young age like
 

6427
01:54:17,119 --> 01:54:18,070
in mathematics from a young age like
todd was

6428
01:54:18,070 --> 01:54:18,080
todd was
 

6429
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:21,189

growing up like and especially in
college when he was in a class that he

6442
01:54:31,589 --> 01:54:31,599
college when he was in a class that he
 

6443
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:34,629
college when he was in a class that he
enjoyed it didn't it just came very

work hard to just ace the class and when
 

6449
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:41,350
work hard to just ace the class and when
he found that the class was boring like

almost failed two classes
and and he was talking about that and

6458
01:54:51,109 --> 01:54:51,119
and and he was talking about that and
 

6459
01:54:51,119 --> 01:54:53,109
and and he was talking about that and
how he brought those studying habits or

6460
01:54:53,109 --> 01:54:53,119
how he brought those studying habits or
 

6461
01:54:53,119 --> 01:54:55,830
how he brought those studying habits or
like uh in existence of studying habits

6462
01:54:55,830 --> 01:54:55,840
like uh in existence of studying habits
 

6463
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:57,750

phd and in for instance when he you know
 

6467
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:02,629
phd and in for instance when he you know
started kind of

6468
01:55:02,629 --> 01:55:02,639
started kind of
 

6469
01:55:02,639 --> 01:55:05,350
started kind of
delving into more complex problems

6470
01:55:05,350 --> 01:55:05,360
delving into more complex problems
 

6471
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:07,510
delving into more complex problems
and classes he struggled a lot because

6472
01:55:07,510 --> 01:55:07,520
and classes he struggled a lot because
 

6473
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:09,109
and classes he struggled a lot because
he didn't have that

6474
01:55:09,109 --> 01:55:09,119
he didn't have that
 

6475

notes and it was he wasn't studying hard
 

6479
01:55:13,199 --> 01:55:15,350
notes and it was he wasn't studying hard
when he when he faced problems

6480
01:55:15,350 --> 01:55:15,360
when he when he faced problems
 

6481
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:18,229
when he when he faced problems
and he almost failed out of his his phd

6482
01:55:18,229 --> 01:55:18,239
and he almost failed out of his his phd
 

6483
01:55:18,239 --> 01:55:21,990
and he almost failed out of his his phd
he almost failed his phd exam and um

6484
01:55:21,990 --> 01:55:22,000
he almost failed his phd exam and um
 

6485
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,430
he almost failed his phd exam and um
it talks about like having this

6486
01:55:23,430 --> 01:55:23,440
it talks about like having this
 

6487
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:25,270
it talks about like having this
conversation with with this advisor and

6488
01:55:25,270 --> 01:55:25,280
conversation with with this advisor and
 

6489
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:27,830
conversation with with this advisor and
the advisor pointing out like you're not

6490
01:55:27,830 --> 01:55:27,840
the advisor pointing out like you're not
 

6491

this is not working

6492
01:55:29,189 --> 01:55:29,199
this is not working
 

6493
01:55:29,199 --> 01:55:31,109
this is not working
you might have to get out of the program

6494
01:55:31,109 --> 01:55:31,119
you might have to get out of the program
 

6495
01:55:31,119 --> 01:55:32,629
you might have to get out of the program
and like how that was a kind of a

6496
01:55:32,629 --> 01:55:32,639
and like how that was a kind of a
 

6497
01:55:32,639 --> 01:55:35,990
and like how that was a kind of a
turning point for him and um

6498
01:55:35,990 --> 01:55:36,000
turning point for him and um
 

6499
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,750
turning point for him and um
and like it was super important in his

6500
01:55:37,750 --> 01:55:37,760
and like it was super important in his
 

6501
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:40,229
and like it was super important in his
career so i think tao is also like this

6502
01:55:40,229 --> 01:55:40,239
career so i think tao is also like this
 

6503
01:55:40,239 --> 01:55:42,229
career so i think tao is also like this
figure that apart from being just an

6504
01:55:42,229 --> 01:55:42,239
figure that apart from being just an
 

6505
01:55:42,239 --> 01:55:43,750
figure that apart from being just an
exceptional mathematician he's also

6506
01:55:43,750 --> 01:55:43,760
exceptional mathematician he's also
 

6507
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:45,750
exceptional mathematician he's also
pretty open about you know what what it

6508
01:55:45,750 --> 01:55:45,760
pretty open about you know what what it
 

6509
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:47,669
pretty open about you know what what it
takes to to to be a mathematician and

6510
01:55:47,669 --> 01:55:47,679
takes to to to be a mathematician and
 

6511
01:55:47,679 --> 01:55:49,510
takes to to to be a mathematician and
some of the struggles of these type of

6512
01:55:49,510 --> 01:55:49,520
some of the struggles of these type of
 

6513
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:51,270
some of the struggles of these type of
careers and and i think it's that's

6514
01:55:51,270 --> 01:55:51,280
careers and and i think it's that's
 

6515
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:52,550
careers and and i think it's that's
super important

6516
01:55:52,550 --> 01:55:52,560
super important
 

6517
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:54,229
super important

01:56:28,550 --> 01:56:28,560
from ours library on twitter
 

6553
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:30,950
from ours library on twitter
i i keep following and unfollowing for

6554
01:56:30,950 --> 01:56:30,960
i i keep following and unfollowing for
 

6555
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:33,750
i i keep following and unfollowing for
my library because

6556
01:56:33,750 --> 01:56:33,760
my library because
 

6557
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:35,910
my library because
because uh it's so

6558
01:56:35,910 --> 01:56:35,920
because uh it's so
 

6559
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:39,189
because uh it's so
it it gives when i follow it um

6560
01:56:39,189 --> 01:56:39,199
it it gives when i follow it um
 

6561
01:56:39,199 --> 01:56:42,629
it it gives when i follow it um
leads me on down rabbit holes often that

6562
01:56:42,629 --> 01:56:42,639
leads me on down rabbit holes often that
 

6563
01:56:42,639 --> 01:56:43,510
leads me on down rabbit holes often that
um

6564
01:56:43,510 --> 01:56:43,520
um
 

6565
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:44,870
um
that

6566
01:56:44,870 --> 01:56:44,880
that
 

6567
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:48,149
that
um that are very fruitful but

6568
01:56:48,149 --> 01:56:48,159
um that are very fruitful but
 

6569
01:56:48,159 --> 01:56:50,709
um that are very fruitful but
but anyway so the the the posts you do

6570
01:56:50,709 --> 01:56:50,719
but anyway so the the the posts you do
 

6571
01:56:50,719 --> 01:56:52,870
but anyway so the the the posts you do
with the on twitter are just these

6572
01:56:52,870 --> 01:56:52,880
with the on twitter are just these
 

6573
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:53,990
with the on twitter are just these
beautiful

6574
01:56:53,990 --> 01:56:54,000
beautiful
 

6575
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,229
beautiful
are things that reveal some beautiful

6576
01:56:56,229 --> 01:56:56,239
are things that reveal some beautiful
 

6577
01:56:56,239 --> 01:56:58,470
are things that reveal some beautiful
aspect of mathematics

6578
01:56:58,470 --> 01:56:58,480
aspect of mathematics
 

6579
01:56:58,480 --> 01:57:00,070
aspect of mathematics
um is there

6580
01:57:00,070 --> 01:57:00,080
um is there
 

6581
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:01,990
um is there
um is there something you could say

6582
01:57:01,990 --> 01:57:02,000
um is there something you could say
 

6583
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,470
um is there something you could say
about the approach there yeah

6584
01:57:04,470 --> 01:57:04,480
about the approach there yeah
 

6585
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:05,669
about the approach there yeah
and um

6586
01:57:05,669 --> 01:57:05,679
and um
 

6587
01:57:05,679 --> 01:57:08,310
and um
maybe

6588
01:57:08,310 --> 01:57:08,320

 

6589
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:10,390

maybe broadly what you find beautiful

6590
01:57:10,390 --> 01:57:10,400
maybe broadly what you find beautiful
 

6591
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:12,310
maybe broadly what you find beautiful
about mathematics and then more

6592
01:57:12,310 --> 01:57:12,320
about mathematics and then more
 

6593
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:14,629
about mathematics and then more
specifically how

6594
01:57:14,629 --> 01:57:14,639
specifically how
 

6595
01:57:14,639 --> 01:57:17,109
specifically how
you convert that into a rigorous process

6596
01:57:17,109 --> 01:57:17,119
you convert that into a rigorous process
 

6597
01:57:17,119 --> 01:57:19,430
you convert that into a rigorous process
of revealing that in tweet form that's a

6598
01:57:19,430 --> 01:57:19,440
of revealing that in tweet form that's a
 

6599
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:21,109
of revealing that in tweet form that's a
good point i think there's something

6600
01:57:21,109 --> 01:57:21,119
good point i think there's something
 

6601
01:57:21,119 --> 01:57:23,350
good point i think there's something
about math that you know a lot of the

6602
01:57:23,350 --> 01:57:23,360
about math that you know a lot of the
 

6603
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:25,669
about math that you know a lot of the
mathematical content and you know paper

6604
01:57:25,669 --> 01:57:25,679
mathematical content and you know paper
 

6605
01:57:25,679 --> 01:57:27,910
mathematical content and you know paper
papers are like little proofs

6606
01:57:27,910 --> 01:57:27,920
papers are like little proofs
 

6607
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:29,350
papers are like little proofs
um you know

6608
01:57:29,350 --> 01:57:29,360
um you know
 

6609
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:30,149
um you know
has

6610
01:57:30,149 --> 01:57:30,159
has
 

6611
01:57:30,159 --> 01:57:33,109
has
in a way sort of an infinite half-life

6612
01:57:33,109 --> 01:57:33,119
in a way sort of an infinite half-life
 

6613
01:57:33,119 --> 01:57:35,030
in a way sort of an infinite half-life
what i mean by that is that if you look

6614
01:57:35,030 --> 01:57:35,040
what i mean by that is that if you look
 

6615
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:37,750
what i mean by that is that if you look
at like euclid's elements it's as valid

6616
01:57:37,750 --> 01:57:37,760
at like euclid's elements it's as valid
 

6617
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:40,390
at like euclid's elements it's as valid
today as it was when it was created like

6618
01:57:40,390 --> 01:57:40,400
today as it was when it was created like
 

6619
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:42,870
today as it was when it was created like
2 000 years ago and that's not true for

6620
01:57:42,870 --> 01:57:42,880
2 000 years ago and that's not true for
 

6621
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:45,270
2 000 years ago and that's not true for
a lot of other scientific fields

6622
01:57:45,270 --> 01:57:45,280
a lot of other scientific fields
 

6623
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:46,470
a lot of other scientific fields
um

6624
01:57:46,470 --> 01:57:46,480
um
 

6625
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:47,350
um
and so

6626
01:57:47,350 --> 01:57:47,360
and so
 

6627
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:49,830
and so
in regards to twitter i think

6628
01:57:49,830 --> 01:57:49,840
in regards to twitter i think
 

6629
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:53,510
in regards to twitter i think
there's also a very it's a very undex

6630
01:57:53,510 --> 01:57:53,520
there's also a very it's a very undex
 

6631
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:55,830
there's also a very it's a very undex
underexplored platform from a learning

6632
01:57:55,830 --> 01:57:55,840
underexplored platform from a learning
 

6633
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:57,350
underexplored platform from a learning
perspective

6634
01:57:57,350 --> 01:57:57,360
perspective
 

6635
01:57:57,360 --> 01:57:59,589
perspective
i think if you look at content on

6636
01:57:59,589 --> 01:57:59,599
i think if you look at content on
 

6637
01:57:59,599 --> 01:58:01,910
i think if you look at content on
twitter it's very easy to consume it's

6638
01:58:01,910 --> 01:58:01,920
twitter it's very easy to consume it's
 

6639
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:03,990
twitter it's very easy to consume it's
very easy to read

6640
01:58:03,990 --> 01:58:04,000
very easy to read
 

6641
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,189
very easy to read
um

6642
01:58:05,189 --> 01:58:05,199
um
 

6643
01:58:05,199 --> 01:58:07,589
um
and especially when you're

6644
01:58:07,589 --> 01:58:07,599
and especially when you're
 

6645
01:58:07,599 --> 01:58:09,830
and especially when you're
trying to explain something you know we

6646
01:58:09,830 --> 01:58:09,840
trying to explain something you know we
 

6647
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:12,390
trying to explain something you know we
humans get a dopamine hit if we learn

6648
01:58:12,390 --> 01:58:12,400
humans get a dopamine hit if we learn
 

6649
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:13,990
humans get a dopamine hit if we learn
something new

6650
01:58:13,990 --> 01:58:14,000
something new
 

6651
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,870
something new
and that's a very very powerful feeling

6652
01:58:16,870 --> 01:58:16,880
and that's a very very powerful feeling
 

6653
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:19,430
and that's a very very powerful feeling
and that's why you know people go to

6654
01:58:19,430 --> 01:58:19,440
and that's why you know people go to
 

6655
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:21,030
and that's why you know people go to
classes when you have a really good

6656
01:58:21,030 --> 01:58:21,040
classes when you have a really good
 

6657
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:23,270
classes when you have a really good
professor you know it's it's looking for

6658
01:58:23,270 --> 01:58:23,280
professor you know it's it's looking for
 

6659
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:25,830
professor you know it's it's looking for
those dopamine hits and

6660
01:58:25,830 --> 01:58:25,840
those dopamine hits and
 

6661
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:26,870
those dopamine hits and
and and

6662
01:58:26,870 --> 01:58:26,880
and and
 

6663
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:28,550
and and
and that's something that we try to

6664
01:58:28,550 --> 01:58:28,560
and that's something that we try to
 

6665
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:30,629
and that's something that we try to
explore when we're producing content on

6666
01:58:30,629 --> 01:58:30,639
explore when we're producing content on
 

6667
01:58:30,639 --> 01:58:32,629
explore when we're producing content on
twitter imagine if we we could

6668
01:58:32,629 --> 01:58:32,639
twitter imagine if we we could
 

6669
01:58:32,639 --> 01:58:34,550
twitter imagine if we we could
if you would on a line to a restaurant

6670
01:58:34,550 --> 01:58:34,560
if you would on a line to a restaurant
 

6671
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:36,550
if you would on a line to a restaurant
you could go go to your phone to learn

6672
01:58:36,550 --> 01:58:36,560
you could go go to your phone to learn
 

6673
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:38,550
you could go go to your phone to learn
something new instead of social

6674
01:58:38,550 --> 01:58:38,560
something new instead of social
 

6675
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:39,669
something new instead of social
going to a

6676
01:58:39,669 --> 01:58:39,679
going to a
 

6677
01:58:39,679 --> 01:58:42,870
going to a
you know social network to just and so

6678
01:58:42,870 --> 01:58:42,880
you know social network to just and so
 

6679
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:44,070
you know social network to just and so
and i think

6680
01:58:44,070 --> 01:58:44,080
and i think
 

6681
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:47,430
and i think
it's very hard to to sometimes to

6682
01:58:47,430 --> 01:58:47,440
it's very hard to to sometimes to
 

6683
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:49,270
it's very hard to to sometimes to
kind of provide that feeling because you

6684
01:58:49,270 --> 01:58:49,280
kind of provide that feeling because you
 

6685
01:58:49,280 --> 01:58:50,390
kind of provide that feeling because you
need to

6686
01:58:50,390 --> 01:58:50,400
need to
 

6687
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:53,589
need to
sometimes digest content and and put it

6688
01:58:53,589 --> 01:58:53,599
sometimes digest content and and put it
 

6689
01:58:53,599 --> 01:58:55,830
sometimes digest content and and put it
in a way you know that it feeds 280

6690
01:58:55,830 --> 01:58:55,840
in a way you know that it feeds 280
 

6691
01:58:55,840 --> 01:58:57,669
in a way you know that it feeds 280
characters um

6692
01:58:57,669 --> 01:58:57,679
characters um
 

6693
01:58:57,679 --> 01:58:59,830
characters um
and and it requires a lot of

6694
01:58:59,830 --> 01:58:59,840
and and it requires a lot of
 

6695
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:01,990
and and it requires a lot of
sometimes time to do that even though

6696
01:59:01,990 --> 01:59:02,000
sometimes time to do that even though
 

6697
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,149
sometimes time to do that even though
it's easy to consume it's hard to make

6698
01:59:04,149 --> 01:59:04,159
it's easy to consume it's hard to make
 

6699
01:59:04,159 --> 01:59:06,950
it's easy to consume it's hard to make
but once you are able to to provide that

6700
01:59:06,950 --> 01:59:06,960
but once you are able to to provide that
 

6701
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:08,950
but once you are able to to provide that
eureka moment to people

6702
01:59:08,950 --> 01:59:08,960
eureka moment to people
 

6703

i mean
 

6749
01:59:57,679 --> 01:59:59,990
i mean
that is so cool that's like some weird

6750
01:59:59,990 --> 02:00:00,000
that is so cool that's like some weird
 

6751
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,830
that is so cool that's like some weird
like glimpse

6752
02:00:01,830 --> 02:00:01,840
like glimpse
 

6753
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:04,629
like glimpse
into some deep universal truth

6754
02:00:04,629 --> 02:00:04,639
into some deep universal truth
 

6755
02:00:04,639 --> 02:00:06,629
into some deep universal truth
even though it's just a number

6756
02:00:06,629 --> 02:00:06,639
even though it's just a number
 

6757
02:00:06,639 --> 02:00:09,589
even though it's just a number
i mean that's like so arbitrary like why

6758
02:00:09,589 --> 02:00:09,599
i mean that's like so arbitrary like why
 

6759
02:00:09,599 --> 02:00:11,669
i mean that's like so arbitrary like why
why is it so pleasant that that's a

6760
02:00:11,669 --> 02:00:11,679
why is it so pleasant that that's a
 

6761
02:00:11,679 --> 02:00:13,669
why is it so pleasant that that's a
thing but it is in some way it's almost

6762
02:00:13,669 --> 02:00:13,679
thing but it is in some way it's almost
 

6763
02:00:13,679 --> 02:00:16,149
thing but it is in some way it's almost
like it is a little glimpse at some

6764
02:00:16,149 --> 02:00:16,159
like it is a little glimpse at some
 

6765
02:00:16,159 --> 02:00:17,669
like it is a little glimpse at some
much bigger

6766
02:00:17,669 --> 02:00:17,679
much bigger
 

6767
02:00:17,679 --> 02:00:20,149
much bigger
like um and and i think like especially

6768
02:00:20,149 --> 02:00:20,159
like um and and i think like especially
 

6769
02:00:20,159 --> 02:00:22,070
like um and and i think like especially
if we're talking about science there's

6770
02:00:22,070 --> 02:00:22,080
if we're talking about science there's
 

6771
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:23,350
if we're talking about science there's
something unique

6772
02:00:23,350 --> 02:00:23,360
something unique
 

6773
02:00:23,360 --> 02:00:25,669
something unique
about you go and with a lot of the

6774
02:00:25,669 --> 02:00:25,679
about you go and with a lot of the
 

6775
02:00:25,679 --> 02:00:27,350
about you go and with a lot of the
tweets you go sometimes from a state of

6776
02:00:27,350 --> 02:00:27,360
tweets you go sometimes from a state of
 

6777
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:28,870
tweets you go sometimes from a state of
not knowing something to knowing

6778
02:00:28,870 --> 02:00:28,880
not knowing something to knowing
 

6779
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:29,750
not knowing something to knowing
something

6780
02:00:29,750 --> 02:00:29,760
something
 

6781
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:32,149
something
and that is very particular to science

6782
02:00:32,149 --> 02:00:32,159
and that is very particular to science
 

6783
02:00:32,159 --> 02:00:34,470
and that is very particular to science
science math physics and that again is

6784
02:00:34,470 --> 02:00:34,480
science math physics and that again is
 

6785
02:00:34,480 --> 02:00:36,550
science math physics and that again is
extra extremely addictive and that's

6786
02:00:36,550 --> 02:00:36,560
extra extremely addictive and that's
 

6787
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:40,950
extra extremely addictive and that's
that's how i i i feel about that and um

6788
02:00:40,950 --> 02:00:40,960
that's how i i i feel about that and um
 

6789
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:42,790
that's how i i i feel about that and um
that's why i think people engage so much

6790
02:00:42,790 --> 02:00:42,800
that's why i think people engage so much
 

6791
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:44,790
that's why i think people engage so much
with with our tweets and go into rabbit

holes and then they you know we start

6794
02:00:46,390 --> 02:00:46,400
holes and then they you know we start
 

6795
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:48,470
holes and then they you know we start
with prime numbers and all of a sudden

6796

with prime numbers and all of a sudden
 

6797
02:00:48,480 --> 02:00:50,709
with prime numbers and all of a sudden
you are spending hours reading number

6798
02:00:50,709 --> 02:00:50,719
you are spending hours reading number

things and you go into wikipedia and you
 

6803
02:00:54,719 --> 02:00:56,790
things and you go into wikipedia and you
lose a lot of time there but

6804

lose a lot of time there but
 

6805
02:00:56,800 --> 02:00:58,149
lose a lot of time there but
well the variety is really interesting

6806
02:00:58,149 --> 02:00:58,159
well the variety is really interesting
 

6807
02:00:58,159 --> 02:01:00,550
well the variety is really interesting
too there's human things there's uh

6808
02:01:00,550 --> 02:01:00,560
too there's human things there's uh
 

6809
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:02,470

there's physics things
 

6811
02:01:02,480 --> 02:01:05,030
there's physics things
there's like numeric things like like i

6812
02:01:05,030 --> 02:01:05,040
there's like numeric things like like i
 

6813
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:06,950

just mentioned but there's also
 

6815
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:09,430
just mentioned but there's also
more rigorous mathematical things

to to quite a good level of mathematics
 

6851
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:43,990
to to quite a good level of mathematics
if they're prepared to deal with these

6852
02:01:43,990 --> 02:01:44,000
if they're prepared to deal with these

the situation of being stuck yeah yeah

6856
02:01:47,990 --> 02:01:48,000
the situation of being stuck yeah yeah
 

6857
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,149
the situation of being stuck yeah yeah
there's some truth to that that's truth

6858
02:01:50,149 --> 02:01:50,159
there's some truth to that that's truth
 

6859
02:01:50,159 --> 02:01:52,790
there's some truth to that that's truth
i feel that's like really

6860

like uh this is the problem with this
 

6921
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:53,589
like uh this is the problem with this
like

6929
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:03,109
will solve everything sometimes it
solves quite a bit but like sometimes

6930
02:03:03,109 --> 02:03:03,119

you need to sit in a stuckness and
 

6933
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:06,390
you need to sit in a stuckness and
suffer a little bit and then take a

6934
02:03:06,390 --> 02:03:06,400
suffer a little bit and then take a

7021
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:38,870
perfect may never come
but just just on like on on our twitter

7022
02:04:38,870 --> 02:04:38,880
but just just on like on on our twitter
 

7023
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:41,189
but just just on like on on our twitter
like profile i really and sometimes when

7024
02:04:41,189 --> 02:04:41,199
like profile i really and sometimes when
 

7025
02:04:41,199 --> 02:04:42,629
like profile i really and sometimes when
you look on some of those tweets they

7026
02:04:42,629 --> 02:04:42,639
you look on some of those tweets they
 

7027
02:04:42,639 --> 02:04:44,550
you look on some of those tweets they
might seem like pretty

7028
02:04:44,550 --> 02:04:44,560
might seem like pretty
 

7029
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:45,430
might seem like pretty
kind of

7030
02:04:45,430 --> 02:04:45,440
kind of
 

7031
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:47,830
kind of
um you know why is this interesting it's

7032
02:04:47,830 --> 02:04:47,840
um you know why is this interesting it's
 

7033
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:50,870
um you know why is this interesting it's
like so raw uh like it's just a number

7034
02:04:50,870 --> 02:04:50,880
like so raw uh like it's just a number
 

7035
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:52,950
like so raw uh like it's just a number
but i really believe that especially

7036
02:04:52,950 --> 02:04:52,960
but i really believe that especially
 

7037
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:54,870
but i really believe that especially
with math or physics

7038
02:04:54,870 --> 02:04:54,880
with math or physics
 

7039
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:57,350
with math or physics
it is possible to get everyone to love

7040
02:04:57,350 --> 02:04:57,360
it is possible to get everyone to love
 

7041
02:04:57,360 --> 02:04:59,430
it is possible to get everyone to love
math or physics even if you think you

7042
02:04:59,430 --> 02:04:59,440
math or physics even if you think you
 

7043
02:04:59,440 --> 02:05:01,910
math or physics even if you think you
hate it it's it's not a function of the

7044
02:05:01,910 --> 02:05:01,920
hate it it's it's not a function of the
 

7045
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:03,350
hate it it's it's not a function of the
student or the person that is on the

7046
02:05:03,350 --> 02:05:03,360
student or the person that is on the
 

7047
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:05,350
student or the person that is on the
other side i think is just purely a

7048
02:05:05,350 --> 02:05:05,360
other side i think is just purely a
 

7049
02:05:05,360 --> 02:05:08,069
other side i think is just purely a
function of like how you explain uh

7050
02:05:08,069 --> 02:05:08,079
function of like how you explain uh
 

7051
02:05:08,079 --> 02:05:10,069
function of like how you explain uh
hidden beauty that they hadn't realized

7052
02:05:10,069 --> 02:05:10,079
hidden beauty that they hadn't realized
 

7053
02:05:10,079 --> 02:05:11,510
hidden beauty that they hadn't realized
before

7054
02:05:11,510 --> 02:05:11,520
before
 

7055
02:05:11,520 --> 02:05:13,750
before
it's not easy but i think it's like a

7056
02:05:13,750 --> 02:05:13,760
it's not easy but i think it's like a
 

7057
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:15,350
it's not easy but i think it's like a
lot of the times it's on like on the

7058
02:05:15,350 --> 02:05:15,360
lot of the times it's on like on the
 

7059
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:18,550
lot of the times it's on like on the
creator's side to to be able to like

7060
02:05:18,550 --> 02:05:18,560
creator's side to to be able to like
 

7061
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:20,550
creator's side to to be able to like
show that beauty to the other person i

7062
02:05:20,550 --> 02:05:20,560
show that beauty to the other person i
 

7063
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:23,030
show that beauty to the other person i
think some of that is native to to

7064
02:05:23,030 --> 02:05:23,040
think some of that is native to to
 

7065
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:25,030
think some of that is native to to
humans we just have that curiosity and

7066
02:05:25,030 --> 02:05:25,040
humans we just have that curiosity and
 

7067
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:27,510
humans we just have that curiosity and
you look at small toddlers and babies

7068
02:05:27,510 --> 02:05:27,520
you look at small toddlers and babies
 

7069
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:29,510
you look at small toddlers and babies
and like them trying to figure things

7070
02:05:29,510 --> 02:05:29,520
and like them trying to figure things
 

7071
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:30,870
and like them trying to figure things
out and there's just something that is

7072
02:05:30,870 --> 02:05:30,880
out and there's just something that is
 

7073
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:33,669
out and there's just something that is
born with us that we we we want for that

7074
02:05:33,669 --> 02:05:33,679
born with us that we we we want for that
 

7075
02:05:33,679 --> 02:05:35,350
born with us that we we we want for that
understanding we want to figure out the

7076
02:05:35,350 --> 02:05:35,360
understanding we want to figure out the
 

7077
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:37,589
understanding we want to figure out the
world around us and and so

7078
02:05:37,589 --> 02:05:37,599
world around us and and so
 

7079
02:05:37,599 --> 02:05:40,069
world around us and and so
yeah it shouldn't be like uh whether or

7080
02:05:40,069 --> 02:05:40,079
yeah it shouldn't be like uh whether or
 

7081
02:05:40,079 --> 02:05:41,990
yeah it shouldn't be like uh whether or
not people are going are going to to

7082
02:05:41,990 --> 02:05:42,000
not people are going are going to to
 

7083
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,910
not people are going are going to to
enjoy it like

7084
02:05:43,910 --> 02:05:43,920
enjoy it like
 

7085
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:46,550
enjoy it like
i i i also really believe that everybody

7086
02:05:46,550 --> 02:05:46,560
i i i also really believe that everybody
 

7087
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:48,790
i i i also really believe that everybody
has that capacity to fall in love with

7088
02:05:48,790 --> 02:05:48,800
has that capacity to fall in love with
 

7089
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:50,870
has that capacity to fall in love with
with math and physics

7090
02:05:50,870 --> 02:05:50,880
with math and physics
 

7091
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:53,030
with math and physics
you mentioned startup

7092
02:05:53,030 --> 02:05:53,040
you mentioned startup
 

7093
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:54,470
you mentioned startup
what do you think it takes to build a

7094
02:05:54,470 --> 02:05:54,480
what do you think it takes to build a
 

7095
02:05:54,480 --> 02:05:57,189
what do you think it takes to build a
successful startup yeah that

7096
02:05:57,189 --> 02:05:57,199
successful startup yeah that
 

7097
02:05:57,199 --> 02:06:00,950
successful startup yeah that
it's what what louise was saying that um

7098
02:06:00,950 --> 02:06:00,960
it's what what louise was saying that um
 

7099
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:02,950
it's what what louise was saying that um
you need to in to be able to endure

7100
02:06:02,950 --> 02:06:02,960
you need to in to be able to endure
 

7101
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:05,510
you need to in to be able to endure
being stuck and and i think

7102
02:06:05,510 --> 02:06:05,520
being stuck and and i think
 

7103
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:08,310
being stuck and and i think
the best way to put it is that startups

7104
02:06:08,310 --> 02:06:08,320
the best way to put it is that startups
 

7105
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:09,830
the best way to put it is that startups
don't have

7106
02:06:09,830 --> 02:06:09,840
don't have
 

7107
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:12,149
don't have
a linear reward function

7108
02:06:12,149 --> 02:06:12,159
a linear reward function
 

7109
02:06:12,159 --> 02:06:14,550
a linear reward function
right you oftentimes don't get rewarded

7110
02:06:14,550 --> 02:06:14,560
right you oftentimes don't get rewarded
 

7111
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:16,950
right you oftentimes don't get rewarded
for effort and and

7112
02:06:16,950 --> 02:06:16,960
for effort and and
 

7113
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:19,830
for effort and and
in most of our lives we go through

7114
02:06:19,830 --> 02:06:19,840
in most of our lives we go through
 

7115
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:21,510
in most of our lives we go through
these processes that

7116
02:06:21,510 --> 02:06:21,520
these processes that
 

7117
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:22,629
these processes that
do

7118
02:06:22,629 --> 02:06:22,639
do
 

7119
02:06:22,639 --> 02:06:24,709
do
give you those small rewards for effort

7120
02:06:24,709 --> 02:06:24,719
give you those small rewards for effort
 

7121
02:06:24,719 --> 02:06:26,550
give you those small rewards for effort
right in school you study hard generally

7122
02:06:26,550 --> 02:06:26,560
right in school you study hard generally
 

7123
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:28,069
right in school you study hard generally
you'll get a good grade and then you

7124
02:06:28,069 --> 02:06:28,079
you'll get a good grade and then you
 

7125
02:06:28,079 --> 02:06:30,790
you'll get a good grade and then you
good you get like good grades ever or

7126
02:06:30,790 --> 02:06:30,800
good you get like good grades ever or
 

7127
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:32,470
good you get like good grades ever or
you get grades every semester and so

7128
02:06:32,470 --> 02:06:32,480
you get grades every semester and so
 

7129
02:06:32,480 --> 02:06:34,709
you get grades every semester and so
you're you're slowly

7130
02:06:34,709 --> 02:06:34,719
you're you're slowly
 

7131
02:06:34,719 --> 02:06:36,390
you're you're slowly
getting rewarded and pushed in the right

7132
02:06:36,390 --> 02:06:36,400
getting rewarded and pushed in the right
 

7133
02:06:36,400 --> 02:06:37,750
getting rewarded and pushed in the right
direction

7134
02:06:37,750 --> 02:06:37,760
direction
 

7135
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:40,390
direction
for for startups and startups are not

7136
02:06:40,390 --> 02:06:40,400
for for startups and startups are not
 

7137
02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:42,149
for for startups and startups are not
the only thing that is like this but for

7138
02:06:42,149 --> 02:06:42,159
the only thing that is like this but for
 

7139
02:06:42,159 --> 02:06:44,229
the only thing that is like this but for
startups it's you know you can put in a

7140
02:06:44,229 --> 02:06:44,239
startups it's you know you can put in a
 

7141
02:06:44,239 --> 02:06:46,229
startups it's you know you can put in a
ton of effort into something

7142
02:06:46,229 --> 02:06:46,239
ton of effort into something
 

7143
02:06:46,239 --> 02:06:48,550
ton of effort into something
that and then get no reward for it right

7144
02:06:48,550 --> 02:06:48,560
that and then get no reward for it right
 

7145
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:50,950
that and then get no reward for it right
it's like like sisyphus boulder where

7146
02:06:50,950 --> 02:06:50,960
it's like like sisyphus boulder where
 

7147
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:53,189
it's like like sisyphus boulder where
you're pushing that boulder up the

7148
02:06:53,189 --> 02:06:53,199
you're pushing that boulder up the
 

7149
02:06:53,199 --> 02:06:54,390
you're pushing that boulder up the
mountain

7150
02:06:54,390 --> 02:06:54,400
mountain
 

7151
02:06:54,400 --> 02:06:56,390
mountain
and and and you get to the top and then

7152
02:06:56,390 --> 02:06:56,400
and and and you get to the top and then
 

7153
02:06:56,400 --> 02:06:58,709
and and and you get to the top and then
it just rolls all the way back down

7154
02:06:58,709 --> 02:06:58,719
it just rolls all the way back down
 

7155
02:06:58,719 --> 02:07:00,470
it just rolls all the way back down
and and so that's something that i think

7156
02:07:00,470 --> 02:07:00,480
and and so that's something that i think
 

7157
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:02,470
and and so that's something that i think
a lot of people are not equipped to deal

7158
02:07:02,470 --> 02:07:02,480
a lot of people are not equipped to deal
 

7159
02:07:02,480 --> 02:07:06,149
a lot of people are not equipped to deal
with and can be incredibly demoralizing

7160
02:07:06,149 --> 02:07:06,159
with and can be incredibly demoralizing
 

7161
02:07:06,159 --> 02:07:08,390
with and can be incredibly demoralizing
especially if that happens more than

7162
02:07:08,390 --> 02:07:08,400
especially if that happens more than
 

7163
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:09,990
especially if that happens more than
than a few times

7164
02:07:09,990 --> 02:07:10,000
than a few times
 

7165
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:11,910
than a few times
and so but i think it's absolutely

7166
02:07:11,910 --> 02:07:11,920
and so but i think it's absolutely
 

7167
02:07:11,920 --> 02:07:15,030
and so but i think it's absolutely
essential to to power through it because

7168
02:07:15,030 --> 02:07:15,040
essential to to power through it because
 

7169
02:07:15,040 --> 02:07:17,430
essential to to power through it because
uh by the nature of startups it's often

7170
02:07:17,430 --> 02:07:17,440
uh by the nature of startups it's often
 

7171
02:07:17,440 --> 02:07:19,990
uh by the nature of startups it's often
times you know you're dealing with with

7172
02:07:19,990 --> 02:07:20,000
times you know you're dealing with with
 

7173
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:23,030
times you know you're dealing with with
with non-obvious ideas and things that

7174
02:07:23,030 --> 02:07:23,040
with non-obvious ideas and things that
 

7175
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:25,910
with non-obvious ideas and things that
there might be contrarian and so you're

7176
02:07:25,910 --> 02:07:25,920
there might be contrarian and so you're
 

7177
02:07:25,920 --> 02:07:28,310
there might be contrarian and so you're

deal with those non-linear reward
 

7193
02:07:43,119 --> 02:07:45,189
deal with those non-linear reward
functions but it's definitely i think

7194
02:07:45,189 --> 02:07:45,199
functions but it's definitely i think
 

7195
02:07:45,199 --> 02:07:47,430
functions but it's definitely i think

in research sometimes you know we're

7202
02:07:52,470 --> 02:07:52,480
in research sometimes you know we're
 

7203
02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:54,069
in research sometimes you know we're
talking about the default studies being

on a particular flavor of the way you've
imagined the design and to like adjust

7238
02:08:31,350 --> 02:08:31,360
imagined the design and to like adjust
 

7239
02:08:31,360 --> 02:08:33,589

it or completely
 

7241
02:08:33,599 --> 02:08:37,350
it or completely
like alter it i think that's a core

7242
02:08:37,350 --> 02:08:37,360
like alter it i think that's a core
 

7243
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:39,189
like alter it i think that's a core
question for startups that i've asked

7244
02:08:39,189 --> 02:08:39,199
question for startups that i've asked
 

7245
02:08:39,199 --> 02:08:42,149
question for startups that i've asked
myself exactly and like i've never been

7246
02:08:42,149 --> 02:08:42,159
myself exactly and like i've never been
 

7247
02:08:42,159 --> 02:08:43,990
myself exactly and like i've never been
able to come up with a great framework

7248
02:08:43,990 --> 02:08:44,000
able to come up with a great framework
 

7249
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,310
able to come up with a great framework
to make those decisions um i think

7250
02:08:46,310 --> 02:08:46,320
to make those decisions um i think
 

7251
02:08:46,320 --> 02:08:49,030
to make those decisions um i think
that's really at the core of

7252
02:08:49,030 --> 02:08:49,040
that's really at the core of
 

7253
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:51,589
that's really at the core of
uh yeah out of a lot of the the toughest

7254
02:08:51,589 --> 02:08:51,599
uh yeah out of a lot of the the toughest
 

7255
02:08:51,599 --> 02:08:52,950
uh yeah out of a lot of the the toughest
questions that

7256
02:08:52,950 --> 02:08:52,960
questions that
 

7257
02:08:52,960 --> 02:08:54,790
questions that
that people that's that started a

7258
02:08:54,790 --> 02:08:54,800
that people that's that started a
 

7259
02:08:54,800 --> 02:08:57,510
that people that's that started a
company have to deal with um

7260
02:08:57,510 --> 02:08:57,520
company have to deal with um
 

7261
02:08:57,520 --> 02:08:59,350
company have to deal with um
i think maybe the best framework that i

7262
02:08:59,350 --> 02:08:59,360
i think maybe the best framework that i
 

7263
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:00,870
i think maybe the best framework that i
i

7264
02:09:00,870 --> 02:09:00,880
i
 

7265
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:02,470
i
was able to figure out like when you run

7266
02:09:02,470 --> 02:09:02,480
was able to figure out like when you run
 

7267
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:05,430
was able to figure out like when you run
out of ideas you just you know you're

7268
02:09:05,430 --> 02:09:05,440
out of ideas you just you know you're
 

7269
02:09:05,440 --> 02:09:07,030
out of ideas you just you know you're
exploring something it's not working you

7270
02:09:07,030 --> 02:09:07,040
exploring something it's not working you
 

7271
02:09:07,040 --> 02:09:09,750
exploring something it's not working you
try it in a different angle you know you

7272
02:09:09,750 --> 02:09:09,760
try it in a different angle you know you
 

7273
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:11,910
try it in a different angle you know you
try a different business model yeah when

7274
02:09:11,910 --> 02:09:11,920
try a different business model yeah when
 

7275
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:13,990
try a different business model yeah when
you run out of ideas like you don't have

7276
02:09:13,990 --> 02:09:14,000
you run out of ideas like you don't have
 

7277
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,709
you run out of ideas like you don't have
any more cards just

7278
02:09:16,709 --> 02:09:16,719
any more cards just
 

7279
02:09:16,719 --> 02:09:18,550
any more cards just
switch and yeah

7280
02:09:18,550 --> 02:09:18,560
switch and yeah
 

7281
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:20,229
switch and yeah
it's not perfect

7282
02:09:20,229 --> 02:09:20,239
it's not perfect
 

7283
02:09:20,239 --> 02:09:22,229
it's not perfect
because you also it's you have a lot of

7284
02:09:22,229 --> 02:09:22,239
because you also it's you have a lot of
 

7285
02:09:22,239 --> 02:09:24,310
because you also it's you have a lot of
stories of startups with like

7286
02:09:24,310 --> 02:09:24,320
stories of startups with like
 

7287
02:09:24,320 --> 02:09:26,709
stories of startups with like
people kept pushing and then you know

7288
02:09:26,709 --> 02:09:26,719
people kept pushing and then you know
 

7289
02:09:26,719 --> 02:09:28,069
people kept pushing and then you know
that paid off

7290
02:09:28,069 --> 02:09:28,079
that paid off
 

7291
02:09:28,079 --> 02:09:30,149
that paid off
and then you have uh philosophies

7292
02:09:30,149 --> 02:09:30,159
and then you have uh philosophies
 

7293
02:09:30,159 --> 02:09:33,669
and then you have uh philosophies
there's like fail fast and pivot fast um

7294
02:09:33,669 --> 02:09:33,679
there's like fail fast and pivot fast um
 

7295
02:09:33,679 --> 02:09:34,709
there's like fail fast and pivot fast um
so it's

7296
02:09:34,709 --> 02:09:34,719
so it's
 

7297
02:09:34,719 --> 02:09:36,709
so it's
you know it's hard to you know balance

7298
02:09:36,709 --> 02:09:36,719
you know it's hard to you know balance
 

7299
02:09:36,719 --> 02:09:38,870
you know it's hard to you know balance
these two worlds and understand what is

7300
02:09:38,870 --> 02:09:38,880
these two worlds and understand what is
 

7301
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:40,550
these two worlds and understand what is
the best framework

7302
02:09:40,550 --> 02:09:40,560
the best framework
 

7303
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:41,990
the best framework
and i mean if you look at four miles

7304
02:09:41,990 --> 02:09:42,000
and i mean if you look at four miles
 

7305
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,149
and i mean if you look at four miles
library your

7306
02:09:44,149 --> 02:09:44,159
library your
 

7307
02:09:44,159 --> 02:09:46,310
library your
maybe you can correct me but it feels

7308
02:09:46,310 --> 02:09:46,320
maybe you can correct me but it feels
 

7309
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:49,430
maybe you can correct me but it feels
like you're an operating in a space

7310
02:09:49,430 --> 02:09:49,440
like you're an operating in a space
 

7311
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:51,030
like you're an operating in a space
where there's a lot of things that are

7312
02:09:51,030 --> 02:09:51,040
where there's a lot of things that are
 

7313
02:09:51,040 --> 02:09:52,310
where there's a lot of things that are
broken

7314
02:09:52,310 --> 02:09:52,320
broken
 

7315
02:09:52,320 --> 02:09:54,950
broken
and or could be significantly improved

7316
02:09:54,950 --> 02:09:54,960
and or could be significantly improved
 

7317
02:09:54,960 --> 02:09:56,629
and or could be significantly improved
so it feels like there's a lot of

7318
02:09:56,629 --> 02:09:56,639
so it feels like there's a lot of
 

7319
02:09:56,639 --> 02:09:59,350
so it feels like there's a lot of
possibilities for pivoting

7320
02:09:59,350 --> 02:09:59,360
possibilities for pivoting
 

7321
02:09:59,360 --> 02:10:01,589
possibilities for pivoting

that's kind of what like stack overflow
 

7335
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:17,430
that's kind of what like stack overflow
and stack exchange has struggled with

02:10:17,430 --> 02:10:17,440
and stack exchange has struggled with
 

7337
02:10:17,440 --> 02:10:19,270
and stack exchange has struggled with
to come up with a solution and they've

7338
02:10:19,270 --> 02:10:19,280
to come up with a solution and they've
 

7339
02:10:19,280 --> 02:10:21,350
to come up with a solution and they've
come up i think with an interesting set

7340
02:10:21,350 --> 02:10:21,360
come up i think with an interesting set
 

7341
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:23,270
come up i think with an interesting set
of solutions that are also i think

7342
02:10:23,270 --> 02:10:23,280
of solutions that are also i think
 

7343
02:10:23,280 --> 02:10:24,790
of solutions that are also i think
flawed in some ways but they're much

7344
02:10:24,790 --> 02:10:24,800
flawed in some ways but they're much
 

7345
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:27,589
flawed in some ways but they're much
much better than the alternatives

7346
02:10:27,589 --> 02:10:27,599
much better than the alternatives
 

7347
02:10:27,599 --> 02:10:29,430
much better than the alternatives
but there's a lot of other possibilities

7348
02:10:29,430 --> 02:10:29,440
but there's a lot of other possibilities
 

7349
02:10:29,440 --> 02:10:31,109
but there's a lot of other possibilities
if we just look at papers as we talked

7350
02:10:31,109 --> 02:10:31,119
if we just look at papers as we talked
 

7351
02:10:31,119 --> 02:10:32,390
if we just look at papers as we talked
about there's so many possible

7352
02:10:32,390 --> 02:10:32,400
about there's so many possible
 

7353
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:34,390
about there's so many possible
revolutions and they're a lot of money

7354
02:10:34,390 --> 02:10:34,400
revolutions and they're a lot of money
 

7355
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:36,229
revolutions and they're a lot of money
to be potentially made in those

7356
02:10:36,229 --> 02:10:36,239
to be potentially made in those
 

7357
02:10:36,239 --> 02:10:38,629
to be potentially made in those
revolutions plus coupled with that the

7358
02:10:38,629 --> 02:10:38,639
revolutions plus coupled with that the
 

7359
02:10:38,639 --> 02:10:40,550
revolutions plus coupled with that the
benefit to humanity

7360
02:10:40,550 --> 02:10:40,560
benefit to humanity
 

7361
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:42,950
benefit to humanity
and so like you're sitting there

7362
02:10:42,950 --> 02:10:42,960
and so like you're sitting there
 

7363
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:44,470
and so like you're sitting there
like i don't know how many people are

7364
02:10:44,470 --> 02:10:44,480
like i don't know how many people are
 

7365
02:10:44,480 --> 02:10:46,950
like i don't know how many people are
legitimately from a business perspective

7366
02:10:46,950 --> 02:10:46,960
legitimately from a business perspective
 

7367
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:48,950
legitimately from a business perspective
playing with these ideas it feels like

7368
02:10:48,950 --> 02:10:48,960
playing with these ideas it feels like
 

7369
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:51,270
playing with these ideas it feels like
there's a lot of ideas here true there

7370
02:10:51,270 --> 02:10:51,280
there's a lot of ideas here true there
 

7371
02:10:51,280 --> 02:10:53,270
there's a lot of ideas here true there
is are you right now grinding in a

7372
02:10:53,270 --> 02:10:53,280
is are you right now grinding in a
 

7373
02:10:53,280 --> 02:10:55,830
is are you right now grinding in a
particular direction like is there a

7374
02:10:55,830 --> 02:10:55,840
particular direction like is there a
 

7375
02:10:55,840 --> 02:10:57,270
particular direction like is there a
like a five-year vision that you're

7376
02:10:57,270 --> 02:10:57,280
like a five-year vision that you're
 

7377
02:10:57,280 --> 02:10:59,189
like a five-year vision that you're
thinking in your mind

7378
02:10:59,189 --> 02:10:59,199
thinking in your mind
 

7379
02:10:59,199 --> 02:11:01,990
thinking in your mind
for us it's more like a 20-year vision

7380
02:11:01,990 --> 02:11:02,000
for us it's more like a 20-year vision
 

7381
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,629
for us it's more like a 20-year vision
in the sense that uh we we've

7382
02:11:04,629 --> 02:11:04,639
in the sense that uh we we've
 

7383
02:11:04,639 --> 02:11:07,270
in the sense that uh we we've
consciously tried to make the decision

7384
02:11:07,270 --> 02:11:07,280
consciously tried to make the decision
 

7385
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:08,629
consciously tried to make the decision
of

7386
02:11:08,629 --> 02:11:08,639
of
 

7387
02:11:08,639 --> 02:11:11,350
of
so we so we run fermat says it's a side

7388
02:11:11,350 --> 02:11:11,360
so we so we run fermat says it's a side
 

7389
02:11:11,360 --> 02:11:13,350
so we so we run fermat says it's a side
project and it's a separate in the sense

7390
02:11:13,350 --> 02:11:13,360
project and it's a separate in the sense
 

7391
02:11:13,360 --> 02:11:15,589
project and it's a separate in the sense
like it's not what we're working on

7392
02:11:15,589 --> 02:11:15,599
like it's not what we're working on
 

7393
02:11:15,599 --> 02:11:17,030
like it's not what we're working on
full-time

7394
02:11:17,030 --> 02:11:17,040
full-time
 

7395
02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:18,229
full-time
and uh

7396
02:11:18,229 --> 02:11:18,239
and uh
 

7397
02:11:18,239 --> 02:11:19,430
and uh
but

7398
02:11:19,430 --> 02:11:19,440
but
 

7399
02:11:19,440 --> 02:11:21,589
but
our thesis there is that

7400
02:11:21,589 --> 02:11:21,599
our thesis there is that
 

7401
02:11:21,599 --> 02:11:23,510
our thesis there is that
we actually think that it's that's a

7402
02:11:23,510 --> 02:11:23,520
we actually think that it's that's a
 

7403
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:25,910
we actually think that it's that's a
good thing at least for for this stage

7404
02:11:25,910 --> 02:11:25,920
good thing at least for for this stage
 

7405
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:28,790
good thing at least for for this stage
of vermont's library um and also because

7406
02:11:28,790 --> 02:11:28,800
of vermont's library um and also because
 

7407
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:30,790
of vermont's library um and also because
some of these projects

7408
02:11:30,790 --> 02:11:30,800
some of these projects
 

7409
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:31,990
some of these projects
you just

7410
02:11:31,990 --> 02:11:32,000
you just
 

7411
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:33,990
you just
if you're coming from a start from a

7412
02:11:33,990 --> 02:11:34,000
if you're coming from a start from a
 

7413
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:38,870
if you're coming from a start from a
startup framework you probably try to

7414
02:11:38,870 --> 02:11:38,880
startup framework you probably try to
 

7415
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:40,950
startup framework you probably try to
try to fit every single idea into

7416
02:11:40,950 --> 02:11:40,960
try to fit every single idea into
 

7417
02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:42,310
try to fit every single idea into
something that can change the world

7418
02:11:42,310 --> 02:11:42,320
something that can change the world
 

7419
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:44,790
something that can change the world
within three to five years and there's

7420
02:11:44,790 --> 02:11:44,800
within three to five years and there's
 

7421
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:46,629
within three to five years and there's
just some problems that take longer than

7422
02:11:46,629 --> 02:11:46,639
just some problems that take longer than
 

7423
02:11:46,639 --> 02:11:48,790
just some problems that take longer than
that right and so you know we're talking

7424
02:11:48,790 --> 02:11:48,800
that right and so you know we're talking
 

7425
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:51,030
that right and so you know we're talking
about archive and i'm very doubtful that

7426
02:11:51,030 --> 02:11:51,040
about archive and i'm very doubtful that
 

7427
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:52,550
about archive and i'm very doubtful that
you could grow

7428
02:11:52,550 --> 02:11:52,560
you could grow
 

7429
02:11:52,560 --> 02:11:55,270
you could grow
like archive into what it is today like

7430
02:11:55,270 --> 02:11:55,280
like archive into what it is today like
 

7431
02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:57,109
like archive into what it is today like
within two or three years no matter how

7432
02:11:57,109 --> 02:11:57,119
within two or three years no matter how
 

7433
02:11:57,119 --> 02:11:59,030
within two or three years no matter how
much money you throw at it there's just

7434
02:11:59,030 --> 02:11:59,040
much money you throw at it there's just
 

7435
02:11:59,040 --> 02:12:01,350
much money you throw at it there's just
some things that can take longer but you

7436
02:12:01,350 --> 02:12:01,360
some things that can take longer but you
 

7437
02:12:01,360 --> 02:12:03,510
some things that can take longer but you
need to be able to power through

7438
02:12:03,510 --> 02:12:03,520
need to be able to power through
 

7439
02:12:03,520 --> 02:12:07,109
need to be able to power through
the the the time that it takes um but if

7440
02:12:07,109 --> 02:12:07,119
the the the time that it takes um but if
 

7441
02:12:07,119 --> 02:12:09,109
the the the time that it takes um but if
you look at it as okay this is a company

7442
02:12:09,109 --> 02:12:09,119
you look at it as okay this is a company
 

7443
02:12:09,119 --> 02:12:10,550
you look at it as okay this is a company
this is a startup we have to grow fast

7444
02:12:10,550 --> 02:12:10,560
this is a startup we have to grow fast
 

7445
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:12,870
this is a startup we have to grow fast
we have to raise money then uh

7446
02:12:12,870 --> 02:12:12,880
we have to raise money then uh
 

7447
02:12:12,880 --> 02:12:15,030
we have to raise money then uh
then sometimes you might forgo those

7448
02:12:15,030 --> 02:12:15,040
then sometimes you might forgo those
 

7449
02:12:15,040 --> 02:12:17,830
then sometimes you might forgo those
ideas because of that um because they

7450
02:12:17,830 --> 02:12:17,840
ideas because of that um because they
 

7451
02:12:17,840 --> 02:12:20,709
ideas because of that um because they
don't very well fit into the

7452
02:12:20,709 --> 02:12:20,719
don't very well fit into the
 

7453
02:12:20,719 --> 02:12:22,629
don't very well fit into the
the typical

7454
02:12:22,629 --> 02:12:22,639
the typical
 

7455
02:12:22,639 --> 02:12:25,189
the typical
startup framework and so for us formats

7456
02:12:25,189 --> 02:12:25,199
startup framework and so for us formats
 

7457
02:12:25,199 --> 02:12:27,189
startup framework and so for us formats
it's something that we're okay with

7458
02:12:27,189 --> 02:12:27,199
it's something that we're okay with
 

7459
02:12:27,199 --> 02:12:29,350
it's something that we're okay with
growing with having it grow slowly and

7460
02:12:29,350 --> 02:12:29,360
growing with having it grow slowly and
 

7461
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:32,629
growing with having it grow slowly and
and maybe taking many years and and and

7462
02:12:32,629 --> 02:12:32,639
and maybe taking many years and and and
 

7463
02:12:32,639 --> 02:12:34,870
and maybe taking many years and and and
that's why we think it's it's not a bad

7464
02:12:34,870 --> 02:12:34,880
that's why we think it's it's not a bad
 

7465
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:36,709
that's why we think it's it's not a bad
thing that it is a side project because

7466
02:12:36,709 --> 02:12:36,719
thing that it is a side project because
 

7467
02:12:36,719 --> 02:12:38,470
thing that it is a side project because
it makes it much more

7468
02:12:38,470 --> 02:12:38,480
it makes it much more
 

7469
02:12:38,480 --> 02:12:39,750
it makes it much more
um

7470
02:12:39,750 --> 02:12:39,760
um
 

7471
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:42,550
um
acceptable in a way and that to to to be

7472
02:12:42,550 --> 02:12:42,560
acceptable in a way and that to to to be
 

7473
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:44,709
acceptable in a way and that to to to be
able to be okay with that that said i

7474
02:12:44,709 --> 02:12:44,719
able to be okay with that that said i
 

7475
02:12:44,719 --> 02:12:46,790
able to be okay with that that said i
think what happens is

7476
02:12:46,790 --> 02:12:46,800
think what happens is
 

7477
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:48,950
think what happens is
if you keep pushing new little features

7478
02:12:48,950 --> 02:12:48,960
if you keep pushing new little features
 

7479
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:51,350
if you keep pushing new little features
new little ideas i feel like there's

7480
02:12:51,350 --> 02:12:51,360
new little ideas i feel like there's
 

7481
02:12:51,360 --> 02:12:53,350
new little ideas i feel like there's
like certain ideas will just become

7482
02:12:53,350 --> 02:12:53,360
like certain ideas will just become
 

7483
02:12:53,360 --> 02:12:55,030
like certain ideas will just become
viral

7484
02:12:55,030 --> 02:12:55,040
viral
 

7485
02:12:55,040 --> 02:12:56,950
viral
like and then you just won't be able to

7486
02:12:56,950 --> 02:12:56,960
like and then you just won't be able to
 

7487
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:59,109
like and then you just won't be able to
help yourself but it'll revolutionize

7488
02:12:59,109 --> 02:12:59,119
help yourself but it'll revolutionize
 

7489
02:12:59,119 --> 02:13:01,350
help yourself but it'll revolutionize
things it feels like there needs to be

7490
02:13:01,350 --> 02:13:01,360
things it feels like there needs to be
 

7491
02:13:01,360 --> 02:13:04,470
things it feels like there needs to be
that needs to be but there's um

7492
02:13:04,470 --> 02:13:04,480

a legitimate publication
 

7613
02:15:11,599 --> 02:15:13,990
a legitimate publication
so going back to the original like uh

7614
02:15:13,990 --> 02:15:14,000
so going back to the original like uh
 

7615
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:15,510
so going back to the original like uh
when we were talking about the backstory

account is that in the army of dead like
 

7649
02:15:49,840 --> 02:15:51,510
account is that in the army of dead like
if someone dies in the army of the

7650
02:15:51,510 --> 02:15:51,520
if someone dies in the army of the
 

7651
02:15:51,520 --> 02:15:54,550
if someone dies in the army of the
living like that person is gonna you

7652
02:15:54,550 --> 02:15:54,560
living like that person is gonna you
 

7653
02:15:54,560 --> 02:15:57,189
living like that person is gonna you
know be a reborn as

7654
02:15:57,189 --> 02:15:57,199
know be a reborn as
 

7655
02:15:57,199 --> 02:15:59,589
know be a reborn as
a soldier in the army of the dead yes

7656
02:15:59,589 --> 02:15:59,599
a soldier in the army of the dead yes
 

7657
02:15:59,599 --> 02:16:01,669
a soldier in the army of the dead yes
and so that was an important thing to

7658
02:16:01,669 --> 02:16:01,679
and so that was an important thing to
 

7659
02:16:01,679 --> 02:16:03,189
and so that was an important thing to
take into account and the initial

7660
02:16:03,189 --> 02:16:03,199
take into account and the initial
 

7661
02:16:03,199 --> 02:16:05,030
take into account and the initial
conditions as you specify it's about a

7662
02:16:05,030 --> 02:16:05,040
conditions as you specify it's about a
 

7663
02:16:05,040 --> 02:16:06,870
conditions as you specify it's about a
hundred thousand on each side exactly so

7664
02:16:06,870 --> 02:16:06,880
hundred thousand on each side exactly so
 

7665
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:08,790
hundred thousand on each side exactly so
i was able i was able to like based on

7666
02:16:08,790 --> 02:16:08,800
i was able i was able to like based on
 

7667
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:10,950
i was able i was able to like based on
some images like on previous episodes to

7668
02:16:10,950 --> 02:16:10,960
some images like on previous episodes to
 

7669
02:16:10,960 --> 02:16:12,310
some images like on previous episodes to
figure out what was the size of the

7670
02:16:12,310 --> 02:16:12,320
figure out what was the size of the
 

7671
02:16:12,320 --> 02:16:13,990
figure out what was the size of the
armies and so what i want what we wanted

7672
02:16:13,990 --> 02:16:14,000
armies and so what i want what we wanted
 

7673
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,390
armies and so what i want what we wanted
to do what we were theorizing was like

7674
02:16:16,390 --> 02:16:16,400
to do what we were theorizing was like
 

7675
02:16:16,400 --> 02:16:19,750
to do what we were theorizing was like
how many soldiers does like a a soldier

7676
02:16:19,750 --> 02:16:19,760
how many soldiers does like a a soldier
 

7677
02:16:19,760 --> 02:16:23,109
how many soldiers does like a a soldier
on the army of the living has to kill

7678
02:16:23,109 --> 02:16:23,119
on the army of the living has to kill
 

7679
02:16:23,119 --> 02:16:25,270
on the army of the living has to kill
in order for them to be able to this to

7680
02:16:25,270 --> 02:16:25,280
in order for them to be able to this to
 

7681
02:16:25,280 --> 02:16:27,350
in order for them to be able to this to
destroy the army of the dead without

7682
02:16:27,350 --> 02:16:27,360
destroy the army of the dead without
 

7683
02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:28,149
destroy the army of the dead without
like

7684
02:16:28,149 --> 02:16:28,159
like
 

7685
02:16:28,159 --> 02:16:30,310
like
losing because every time

7686
02:16:30,310 --> 02:16:30,320
losing because every time
 

7687
02:16:30,320 --> 02:16:31,910
losing because every time
one of the good soldiers died is going

7688
02:16:31,910 --> 02:16:31,920
one of the good soldiers died is going
 

7689
02:16:31,920 --> 02:16:33,830
one of the good soldiers died is going
to turn into like the other side and so

7690
02:16:33,830 --> 02:16:33,840
to turn into like the other side and so
 

7691
02:16:33,840 --> 02:16:36,469
to turn into like the other side and so
it's so i we we were theorizing that and

7692
02:16:36,469 --> 02:16:36,479
it's so i we we were theorizing that and
 

7693
02:16:36,479 --> 02:16:39,110
it's so i we we were theorizing that and
and i wrote a couple of uh differential

7694
02:16:39,110 --> 02:16:39,120
and i wrote a couple of uh differential
 

7695
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:41,110
and i wrote a couple of uh differential
equations and um i was able to figure

7696
02:16:41,110 --> 02:16:41,120
equations and um i was able to figure
 

7697
02:16:41,120 --> 02:16:42,870
equations and um i was able to figure
out that based on the size of the armies

7698
02:16:42,870 --> 02:16:42,880
out that based on the size of the armies
 

7699
02:16:42,880 --> 02:16:44,469
out that based on the size of the armies
i think i think was the ratio had to be

7700
02:16:44,469 --> 02:16:44,479
i think i think was the ratio had to be
 

7701
02:16:44,479 --> 02:16:48,469
i think i think was the ratio had to be
like 1.7 so it had to kill like 1.7 um

7702
02:16:48,469 --> 02:16:48,479
like 1.7 so it had to kill like 1.7 um
 

7703
02:16:48,479 --> 02:16:50,230
like 1.7 so it had to kill like 1.7 um
soldiers like the army of the dead in

7704
02:16:50,230 --> 02:16:50,240
soldiers like the army of the dead in
 

7705
02:16:50,240 --> 02:16:52,549
soldiers like the army of the dead in
order for them to win the battle

7706
02:16:52,549 --> 02:16:52,559
order for them to win the battle
 

7707
02:16:52,559 --> 02:16:55,349
order for them to win the battle
well yeah that's that's science it is

7708
02:16:55,349 --> 02:16:55,359
well yeah that's that's science it is
 

7709
02:16:55,359 --> 02:16:56,709
well yeah that's that's science it is
it's it's

7710
02:16:56,709 --> 02:16:56,719
it's it's
 

7711
02:16:56,719 --> 02:16:58,070
it's it's
most powerful

7712
02:16:58,070 --> 02:16:58,080
most powerful
 

7713
02:16:58,080 --> 02:17:01,669
most powerful
and this is also somehow a pitch

7714
02:17:01,669 --> 02:17:01,679
and this is also somehow a pitch
 

7715
02:17:01,679 --> 02:17:04,230
and this is also somehow a pitch
for uh like a hiring pitch in a sense

7716
02:17:04,230 --> 02:17:04,240
for uh like a hiring pitch in a sense
 

7717
02:17:04,240 --> 02:17:06,150
for uh like a hiring pitch in a sense
like this is the kind of uh yeah before

7718
02:17:06,150 --> 02:17:06,160
like this is the kind of uh yeah before
 

7719
02:17:06,160 --> 02:17:08,549
like this is the kind of uh yeah before
the science you do it exactly yeah

7720
02:17:08,549 --> 02:17:08,559
the science you do it exactly yeah
 

7721
02:17:08,559 --> 02:17:11,030
the science you do it exactly yeah
well turned out to be you know as as is

7722
02:17:11,030 --> 02:17:11,040
well turned out to be you know as as is
 

7723
02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:12,629
well turned out to be you know as as is
for people that have watched these shows

7724
02:17:12,629 --> 02:17:12,639
for people that have watched these shows
 

7725
02:17:12,639 --> 02:17:14,709
for people that have watched these shows
is like they know that every time you

7726
02:17:14,709 --> 02:17:14,719
is like they know that every time you
 

7727
02:17:14,719 --> 02:17:16,230
is like they know that every time you
try to predict something that is going

7728
02:17:16,230 --> 02:17:16,240
try to predict something that is going
 

7729
02:17:16,240 --> 02:17:17,349
try to predict something that is going
to happen it's going to you're going to

7730
02:17:17,349 --> 02:17:17,359
to happen it's going to you're going to
 

7731
02:17:17,359 --> 02:17:19,270
to happen it's going to you're going to
fail miserably and that's what happened

7732
02:17:19,270 --> 02:17:19,280
fail miserably and that's what happened
 

7733
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:23,110
fail miserably and that's what happened
so it was not not at all important

7734
02:17:23,110 --> 02:17:23,120
so it was not not at all important
 

7735
02:17:23,120 --> 02:17:24,950
so it was not not at all important
for the show but yeah we ended up like

7736
02:17:24,950 --> 02:17:24,960
for the show but yeah we ended up like
 

7737
02:17:24,960 --> 02:17:26,309
for the show but yeah we ended up like
putting that out and there was a lot of

7738
02:17:26,309 --> 02:17:26,319
putting that out and there was a lot of
 

7739
02:17:26,319 --> 02:17:28,070
putting that out and there was a lot of
people that shared that i think was some

7740
02:17:28,070 --> 02:17:28,080
people that shared that i think was some
 

7741
02:17:28,080 --> 02:17:29,990
people that shared that i think was some
like elements of the of the show the

7742
02:17:29,990 --> 02:17:30,000
like elements of the of the show the
 

7743
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,389
like elements of the of the show the
cast of the show that actually retweeted

7744
02:17:32,389 --> 02:17:32,399
cast of the show that actually retweeted
 

7745
02:17:32,399 --> 02:17:34,389
cast of the show that actually retweeted
that and shared that at first so it was

7746
02:17:34,389 --> 02:17:34,399
that and shared that at first so it was
 

7747
02:17:34,399 --> 02:17:35,830
that and shared that at first so it was
fun i would love if this kind of

7748
02:17:35,830 --> 02:17:35,840
fun i would love if this kind of
 

7749
02:17:35,840 --> 02:17:38,549
fun i would love if this kind of
calculation happened uh like during the

7750
02:17:38,549 --> 02:17:38,559
calculation happened uh like during the
 

7751
02:17:38,559 --> 02:17:41,429
calculation happened uh like during the
making of the show or the you know i

7752
02:17:41,429 --> 02:17:41,439
making of the show or the you know i
 

7753
02:17:41,439 --> 02:17:42,629
making of the show or the you know i
love it

7754
02:17:42,629 --> 02:17:42,639
love it
 

7755
02:17:42,639 --> 02:17:44,629
love it
like in um

7756
02:17:44,629 --> 02:17:44,639
like in um
 

7757
02:17:44,639 --> 02:17:47,190
like in um
for example i now know um alex garland

7758
02:17:47,190 --> 02:17:47,200
for example i now know um alex garland
 

7759
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:49,270
for example i now know um alex garland
the director of ex machina

7760
02:17:49,270 --> 02:17:49,280
the director of ex machina
 

7761
02:17:49,280 --> 02:17:50,549
the director of ex machina
and i love it

7762
02:17:50,549 --> 02:17:50,559
and i love it
 

7763
02:17:50,559 --> 02:17:52,070
and i love it
he doesn't seem to be

7764
02:17:52,070 --> 02:17:52,080
he doesn't seem to be
 

7765
02:17:52,080 --> 02:17:53,429
he doesn't seem to be
some

7766
02:17:53,429 --> 02:17:53,439
some
 

7767
02:17:53,439 --> 02:17:54,950
some
not many people seem to do this but i

7768
02:17:54,950 --> 02:17:54,960
not many people seem to do this but i
 

7769
02:17:54,960 --> 02:17:57,270
not many people seem to do this but i
love it when directors

7770
02:17:57,270 --> 02:17:57,280
love it when directors
 

7771
02:17:57,280 --> 02:17:59,830
love it when directors
and people who wrote the story

7772
02:17:59,830 --> 02:17:59,840
and people who wrote the story
 

7773
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:01,349
and people who wrote the story
really think through the technical

7774
02:18:01,349 --> 02:18:01,359
really think through the technical
 

7775
02:18:01,359 --> 02:18:02,549
really think through the technical
details

7776
02:18:02,549 --> 02:18:02,559
details
 

7777
02:18:02,559 --> 02:18:04,469
details
like whether it's knowing like how

7778
02:18:04,469 --> 02:18:04,479
like whether it's knowing like how
 

7779
02:18:04,479 --> 02:18:06,950
like whether it's knowing like how
things even if it's science fiction

7780
02:18:06,950 --> 02:18:06,960
things even if it's science fiction
 

7781
02:18:06,960 --> 02:18:08,629
things even if it's science fiction
if you were to try to do this how would

7782
02:18:08,629 --> 02:18:08,639
if you were to try to do this how would
 

7783
02:18:08,639 --> 02:18:11,270
if you were to try to do this how would
you do this like stephen wolfram and his

7784
02:18:11,270 --> 02:18:11,280
you do this like stephen wolfram and his
 

7785
02:18:11,280 --> 02:18:13,750
you do this like stephen wolfram and his
son were

7786
02:18:13,750 --> 02:18:13,760
son were
 

7787
02:18:13,760 --> 02:18:15,190
son were
were collaborating with the movie

7788
02:18:15,190 --> 02:18:15,200
were collaborating with the movie
 

7789
02:18:15,200 --> 02:18:18,150
were collaborating with the movie
arrival in designing the alien language

7790
02:18:18,150 --> 02:18:18,160
arrival in designing the alien language
 

7791
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:20,629
arrival in designing the alien language
how you communicate with aliens like how

7792
02:18:20,629 --> 02:18:20,639
how you communicate with aliens like how
 

7793
02:18:20,639 --> 02:18:22,469
how you communicate with aliens like how
would you really have

7794
02:18:22,469 --> 02:18:22,479
would you really have
 

7795
02:18:22,479 --> 02:18:25,669
would you really have
a math-based language that uh that could

7796
02:18:25,669 --> 02:18:25,679
a math-based language that uh that could
 

7797
02:18:25,679 --> 02:18:27,669
a math-based language that uh that could
span the alien

7798
02:18:27,669 --> 02:18:27,679
span the alien
 

7799
02:18:27,679 --> 02:18:30,150
span the alien
and uh being and the human

7800
02:18:30,150 --> 02:18:30,160
and uh being and the human
 

7801
02:18:30,160 --> 02:18:32,790
and uh being and the human
being so i i love it when they have that

7802
02:18:32,790 --> 02:18:32,800
being so i i love it when they have that
 

7803
02:18:32,800 --> 02:18:34,629
being so i i love it when they have that
kind of regular the martian was also big

7804
02:18:34,629 --> 02:18:34,639
kind of regular the martian was also big
 

7805
02:18:34,639 --> 02:18:36,150
kind of regular the martian was also big
on that like the book in the movie was

7806
02:18:36,150 --> 02:18:36,160
on that like the book in the movie was
 

7807
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:39,429
on that like the book in the movie was
all about like can we actually

7808
02:18:39,429 --> 02:18:39,439
all about like can we actually
 

7809
02:18:39,439 --> 02:18:41,349
all about like can we actually
is this plausible can these happen it

7810
02:18:41,349 --> 02:18:41,359
is this plausible can these happen it
 

7811
02:18:41,359 --> 02:18:43,030
is this plausible can these happen it
was all about that and that can really

7812
02:18:43,030 --> 02:18:43,040
was all about that and that can really
 

7813
02:18:43,040 --> 02:18:45,110
was all about that and that can really
bring you in like the sometimes the

7814
02:18:45,110 --> 02:18:45,120
bring you in like the sometimes the
 

7815
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:47,750
bring you in like the sometimes the
small details uh i mean the guy that

7816
02:18:47,750 --> 02:18:47,760
small details uh i mean the guy that
 

7817
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:50,389
small details uh i mean the guy that
wrote the martian book is another book

7818
02:18:50,389 --> 02:18:50,399
wrote the martian book is another book
 

7819
02:18:50,399 --> 02:18:53,110
wrote the martian book is another book
that is also filled with those like

7820
02:18:53,110 --> 02:18:53,120
that is also filled with those like
 

7821
02:18:53,120 --> 02:18:55,349
that is also filled with those like
things that when you realize that okay

7822
02:18:55,349 --> 02:18:55,359
things that when you realize that okay
 

7823
02:18:55,359 --> 02:18:57,990
things that when you realize that okay
these are grounded in in science can

7824
02:18:57,990 --> 02:18:58,000
these are grounded in in science can
 

7825
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,950
these are grounded in in science can
just really bring you in yeah right like

7826
02:19:00,950 --> 02:19:00,960
just really bring you in yeah right like
 

7827
02:19:00,960 --> 02:19:03,270
just really bring you in yeah right like
there's a book about a colony on the

7828
02:19:03,270 --> 02:19:03,280
there's a book about a colony on the
 

7829
02:19:03,280 --> 02:19:05,030
there's a book about a colony on the
colony on the moon and he goes about

7830
02:19:05,030 --> 02:19:05,040
colony on the moon and he goes about
 

7831
02:19:05,040 --> 02:19:06,790
colony on the moon and he goes about
like all the details that would you know

7832
02:19:06,790 --> 02:19:06,800
like all the details that would you know
 

7833
02:19:06,800 --> 02:19:08,549
like all the details that would you know
be required about setting up a colony in

7834
02:19:08,549 --> 02:19:08,559
be required about setting up a colony in
 

7835
02:19:08,559 --> 02:19:10,469
be required about setting up a colony in
the moon and like things that he

7836
02:19:10,469 --> 02:19:10,479
the moon and like things that he
 

7837
02:19:10,479 --> 02:19:12,549
the moon and like things that he
wouldn't think about like the the fact

7838
02:19:12,549 --> 02:19:12,559
wouldn't think about like the the fact
 

7839
02:19:12,559 --> 02:19:15,349
wouldn't think about like the the fact
that um they would you know it's hard to

7840
02:19:15,349 --> 02:19:15,359
that um they would you know it's hard to
 

7841
02:19:15,359 --> 02:19:17,990
that um they would you know it's hard to
bring like uh air to the moon say so

7842
02:19:17,990 --> 02:19:18,000
bring like uh air to the moon say so
 

7843
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,309
bring like uh air to the moon say so
they wouldn't like how do you make that

7844
02:19:20,309 --> 02:19:20,319
they wouldn't like how do you make that
 

7845
02:19:20,319 --> 02:19:22,309
they wouldn't like how do you make that
breathable that environment breathable

7846
02:19:22,309 --> 02:19:22,319
breathable that environment breathable
 

7847
02:19:22,319 --> 02:19:24,549
breathable that environment breathable
you need to bring oxygen but like you

7848
02:19:24,549 --> 02:19:24,559
you need to bring oxygen but like you
 

7849
02:19:24,559 --> 02:19:26,790
you need to bring oxygen but like you
you you probably wouldn't be bring

7850
02:19:26,790 --> 02:19:26,800
you you probably wouldn't be bring
 

7851
02:19:26,800 --> 02:19:28,790
you you probably wouldn't be bring
nitrogen so what you do is like instead

7852
02:19:28,790 --> 02:19:28,800
nitrogen so what you do is like instead
 

7853
02:19:28,800 --> 02:19:31,349
nitrogen so what you do is like instead
of having a an

7854
02:19:31,349 --> 02:19:31,359
of having a an
 

7855
02:19:31,359 --> 02:19:33,270
of having a an
atmosphere that is 100

7856
02:19:33,270 --> 02:19:33,280
atmosphere that is 100
 

7857
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:35,669
atmosphere that is 100
oxygen you like decrease the pressure so

7858
02:19:35,669 --> 02:19:35,679
oxygen you like decrease the pressure so
 

7859
02:19:35,679 --> 02:19:37,990
oxygen you like decrease the pressure so
that you have the same ratio of oxygen

7860
02:19:37,990 --> 02:19:38,000
that you have the same ratio of oxygen
 

7861
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,150
that you have the same ratio of oxygen
on earth but like lowering the pressure

7862
02:19:40,150 --> 02:19:40,160
on earth but like lowering the pressure
 

7863
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:43,030
on earth but like lowering the pressure
here and so like things like water boils

7864
02:19:43,030 --> 02:19:43,040
here and so like things like water boils
 

7865
02:19:43,040 --> 02:19:45,589
here and so like things like water boils
at the lower temperature so people would

7866
02:19:45,589 --> 02:19:45,599
at the lower temperature so people would
 

7867
02:19:45,599 --> 02:19:47,349
at the lower temperature so people would
would have coffee and the coffee would

7868
02:19:47,349 --> 02:19:47,359
would have coffee and the coffee would
 

7869
02:19:47,359 --> 02:19:49,429
would have coffee and the coffee would
be colder like there was a problem in

7870
02:19:49,429 --> 02:19:49,439
be colder like there was a problem in
 

7871
02:19:49,439 --> 02:19:52,230
be colder like there was a problem in
this uh environment in the moon so like

7872
02:19:52,230 --> 02:19:52,240
this uh environment in the moon so like
 

7873
02:19:52,240 --> 02:19:53,830
this uh environment in the moon so like
and these are like small things in the

7874
02:19:53,830 --> 02:19:53,840
and these are like small things in the
 

7875
02:19:53,840 --> 02:19:54,630
and these are like small things in the
book

7876
02:19:54,630 --> 02:19:54,640
book
 

7877
02:19:54,640 --> 02:19:55,830
book
but

7878
02:19:55,830 --> 02:19:55,840
but
 

7879
02:19:55,840 --> 02:19:57,510
but
i studied physics so like when i read

7880
02:19:57,510 --> 02:19:57,520
i studied physics so like when i read
 

7881
02:19:57,520 --> 02:20:00,870
i studied physics so like when i read
this i that throws me into like

7882
02:20:00,870 --> 02:20:00,880
this i that throws me into like
 

7883
02:20:00,880 --> 02:20:03,750
this i that throws me into like
a tangents and i start researching that

7884
02:20:03,750 --> 02:20:03,760
a tangents and i start researching that
 

7885
02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:06,309
a tangents and i start researching that
and it's like i really like to read

7886
02:20:06,309 --> 02:20:06,319
and it's like i really like to read
 

7887
02:20:06,319 --> 02:20:08,309
and it's like i really like to read
books and and watch movies when they go

7888
02:20:08,309 --> 02:20:08,319
books and and watch movies when they go
 

7889
02:20:08,319 --> 02:20:10,150
books and and watch movies when they go
to that level of detail

7890
02:20:10,150 --> 02:20:10,160
to that level of detail
 

7891
02:20:10,160 --> 02:20:12,550
to that level of detail
uh uh about science yeah i think

7892
02:20:12,550 --> 02:20:12,560
uh uh about science yeah i think
 

7893
02:20:12,560 --> 02:20:13,990
uh uh about science yeah i think
interstellar was one where they also

7894
02:20:13,990 --> 02:20:14,000
interstellar was one where they also
 

7895
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:15,590
interstellar was one where they also
consulted heavily with with the number

7896
02:20:15,590 --> 02:20:15,600
consulted heavily with with the number
 

7897
02:20:15,600 --> 02:20:17,670
consulted heavily with with the number
of yeah i think even resulted in a

7898
02:20:17,670 --> 02:20:17,680
of yeah i think even resulted in a
 

7899
02:20:17,680 --> 02:20:19,270
of yeah i think even resulted in a
couple of papers a couple papers about

7900
02:20:19,270 --> 02:20:19,280
couple of papers a couple papers about
 

7901
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:22,070
couple of papers a couple papers about
like the black hole uh visualizations

7902
02:20:22,070 --> 02:20:22,080
like the black hole uh visualizations
 

7903
02:20:22,080 --> 02:20:24,070
like the black hole uh visualizations
and um

7904
02:20:24,070 --> 02:20:24,080
and um
 

7905
02:20:24,080 --> 02:20:25,590
and um
yeah but there's and there's even more

7906
02:20:25,590 --> 02:20:25,600
yeah but there's and there's even more
 

7907
02:20:25,600 --> 02:20:27,670
yeah but there's and there's even more
examples of interesting science around

7908
02:20:27,670 --> 02:20:27,680
examples of interesting science around
 

7909
02:20:27,680 --> 02:20:29,670
examples of interesting science around
like these fantasy

7910
02:20:29,670 --> 02:20:29,680
like these fantasy
 

7911
02:20:29,680 --> 02:20:31,590
like these fantasy
we were reading at some point like these

7912
02:20:31,590 --> 02:20:31,600
we were reading at some point like these
 

7913
02:20:31,600 --> 02:20:33,910
we were reading at some point like these
guys that were uh trying to figure out

7914
02:20:33,910 --> 02:20:33,920
guys that were uh trying to figure out
 

7915
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:37,429
guys that were uh trying to figure out
if if the tolkien's middle earth if it

7916
02:20:37,429 --> 02:20:37,439
if if the tolkien's middle earth if it
 

7917
02:20:37,439 --> 02:20:41,590
if if the tolkien's middle earth if it
was uh round if it was like a sphere if

7918
02:20:41,590 --> 02:20:41,600
was uh round if it was like a sphere if
 

7919
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:44,630
was uh round if it was like a sphere if
it was like

7920
02:20:44,630 --> 02:20:44,640

 

7921
02:20:44,640 --> 02:20:46,150

based on the map and some of the

7922
02:20:46,150 --> 02:20:46,160
based on the map and some of the
 

7923
02:20:46,160 --> 02:20:48,150
based on the map and some of the
references in the

7924
02:20:48,150 --> 02:20:48,160
references in the
 

7925
02:20:48,160 --> 02:20:50,870
references in the
in the books and so uh yeah we actually

7926
02:20:50,870 --> 02:20:50,880
in the books and so uh yeah we actually
 

7927
02:20:50,880 --> 02:20:52,630
in the books and so uh yeah we actually
i think we tweeted about that

7928
02:20:52,630 --> 02:20:52,640
i think we tweeted about that
 

7929
02:20:52,640 --> 02:20:54,070
i think we tweeted about that
yeah we did based on the distance

7930
02:20:54,070 --> 02:20:54,080
yeah we did based on the distance
 

7931
02:20:54,080 --> 02:20:55,590
yeah we did based on the distance
between the cities you can actually

7932
02:20:55,590 --> 02:20:55,600
between the cities you can actually
 

7933
02:20:55,600 --> 02:20:58,710
between the cities you can actually
prove that that could be like a map of a

7934
02:20:58,710 --> 02:20:58,720
prove that that could be like a map of a
 

7935
02:20:58,720 --> 02:21:00,790
prove that that could be like a map of a
sphere or like a spheroid and and you

7936
02:21:00,790 --> 02:21:00,800
sphere or like a spheroid and and you
 

7937
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:02,790
sphere or like a spheroid and and you
can actually calculate the radius of

7938
02:21:02,790 --> 02:21:02,800
can actually calculate the radius of
 

7939
02:21:02,800 --> 02:21:04,389
can actually calculate the radius of
that planet

7940
02:21:04,389 --> 02:21:04,399
that planet
 

7941
02:21:04,399 --> 02:21:06,870
that planet
uh

7942
02:21:06,870 --> 02:21:06,880

 

7943
02:21:06,880 --> 02:21:08,710

that's fascinating

7944
02:21:08,710 --> 02:21:08,720
that's fascinating
 

7945
02:21:08,720 --> 02:21:10,710
that's fascinating
i mean yeah that's fascinating but

7946
02:21:10,710 --> 02:21:10,720
i mean yeah that's fascinating but
 

7947
02:21:10,720 --> 02:21:13,990
i mean yeah that's fascinating but
there's something about like calculating

7948
02:21:13,990 --> 02:21:14,000
there's something about like calculating
 

7949
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:15,429
there's something about like calculating
the number

7950
02:21:15,429 --> 02:21:15,439
the number
 

7951
02:21:15,439 --> 02:21:16,389
the number
like

7952
02:21:16,389 --> 02:21:16,399
like
 

7953
02:21:16,399 --> 02:21:18,870
like
exactly the calculation you did for for

7954
02:21:18,870 --> 02:21:18,880
exactly the calculation you did for for
 

7955
02:21:18,880 --> 02:21:21,510
exactly the calculation you did for for
the battle winterfell is um

7956
02:21:21,510 --> 02:21:21,520
the battle winterfell is um
 

7957
02:21:21,520 --> 02:21:22,870
the battle winterfell is um
there's something fascinating about that

7958
02:21:22,870 --> 02:21:22,880
there's something fascinating about that
 

7959
02:21:22,880 --> 02:21:25,349
there's something fascinating about that
because it's not like being

7960
02:21:25,349 --> 02:21:25,359
because it's not like being
 

7961
02:21:25,359 --> 02:21:28,230
because it's not like being
that's very mathematical versus like

7962
02:21:28,230 --> 02:21:28,240
that's very mathematical versus like
 

7963
02:21:28,240 --> 02:21:30,070
that's very mathematical versus like
grounded in physics

7964
02:21:30,070 --> 02:21:30,080
grounded in physics
 

7965
02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:32,150
grounded in physics
and that's really interesting i mean

7966
02:21:32,150 --> 02:21:32,160
and that's really interesting i mean
 

7967
02:21:32,160 --> 02:21:34,710
and that's really interesting i mean
that's like injecting mathematics into

7968
02:21:34,710 --> 02:21:34,720
that's like injecting mathematics into
 

7969
02:21:34,720 --> 02:21:36,309
that's like injecting mathematics into
fantasy

7970
02:21:36,309 --> 02:21:36,319
fantasy
 

7971
02:21:36,319 --> 02:21:38,469
fantasy
there's there's something um i see

7972
02:21:38,469 --> 02:21:38,479
there's there's something um i see
 

7973
02:21:38,479 --> 02:21:40,309
there's there's something um i see
magical about that and and that for me

7974
02:21:40,309 --> 02:21:40,319
magical about that and and that for me
 

7975
02:21:40,319 --> 02:21:42,150
magical about that and and that for me
that's why i think it's also when you

7976
02:21:42,150 --> 02:21:42,160
that's why i think it's also when you
 

7977
02:21:42,160 --> 02:21:44,309
that's why i think it's also when you
look at things like

7978
02:21:44,309 --> 02:21:44,319
look at things like
 

7979
02:21:44,319 --> 02:21:46,790
look at things like
like uh fermat's last theorem like

7980
02:21:46,790 --> 02:21:46,800
like uh fermat's last theorem like
 

7981
02:21:46,800 --> 02:21:48,469
like uh fermat's last theorem like
problems that are very kind of

7982
02:21:48,469 --> 02:21:48,479
problems that are very kind of
 

7983
02:21:48,479 --> 02:21:50,630
problems that are very kind of
self-contained and simple to state yeah

7984
02:21:50,630 --> 02:21:50,640
self-contained and simple to state yeah
 

7985
02:21:50,640 --> 02:21:51,830
self-contained and simple to state yeah
i think like

7986
02:21:51,830 --> 02:21:51,840
i think like
 

7987
02:21:51,840 --> 02:21:53,030
i think like
that's the same with that paper it's

7988
02:21:53,030 --> 02:21:53,040
that's the same with that paper it's
 

7989
02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:54,550
that's the same with that paper it's
very easy to understand the boundaries

7990
02:21:54,550 --> 02:21:54,560
very easy to understand the boundaries
 

7991
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:55,910
very easy to understand the boundaries
of the problem you know

7992
02:21:55,910 --> 02:21:55,920
of the problem you know
 

7993
02:21:55,920 --> 02:22:00,469
of the problem you know
um and and that for me that's why those

7994
02:22:00,469 --> 02:22:00,479
um and and that for me that's why those
 

7995
02:22:00,479 --> 02:22:02,309
um and and that for me that's why those
and that's why math is so appealing and

7996
02:22:02,309 --> 02:22:02,319
and that's why math is so appealing and
 

7997
02:22:02,319 --> 02:22:04,070
and that's why math is so appealing and
those like problems are also so

7998
02:22:04,070 --> 02:22:04,080
those like problems are also so
 

7999
02:22:04,080 --> 02:22:06,230
those like problems are also so
appealing to the general public it's not

8000
02:22:06,230 --> 02:22:06,240
appealing to the general public it's not
 

8001
02:22:06,240 --> 02:22:07,990
appealing to the general public it's not
that they look simple or that people

8002
02:22:07,990 --> 02:22:08,000
that they look simple or that people
 

8003
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,870
that they look simple or that people
think that they're easy to like solve

8004
02:22:10,870 --> 02:22:10,880
think that they're easy to like solve
 

8005
02:22:10,880 --> 02:22:12,870
think that they're easy to like solve
but i feel that a lot of the times they

8006
02:22:12,870 --> 02:22:12,880
but i feel that a lot of the times they
 

8007
02:22:12,880 --> 02:22:13,670
but i feel that a lot of the times they
are

8008
02:22:13,670 --> 02:22:13,680
are
 

8009
02:22:13,680 --> 02:22:15,830
are
almost intellectually democratic because

8010
02:22:15,830 --> 02:22:15,840
almost intellectually democratic because
 

8011
02:22:15,840 --> 02:22:16,790
almost intellectually democratic because
everyone

8012
02:22:16,790 --> 02:22:16,800
everyone
 

8013
02:22:16,800 --> 02:22:18,469
everyone
understands the starting point you know

8014
02:22:18,469 --> 02:22:18,479
understands the starting point you know
 

8015
02:22:18,479 --> 02:22:20,309
understands the starting point you know
you look at fermat's last theorem

8016
02:22:20,309 --> 02:22:20,319
you look at fermat's last theorem
 

8017
02:22:20,319 --> 02:22:22,469
you look at fermat's last theorem
everyone understands like is the this is

8018
02:22:22,469 --> 02:22:22,479
everyone understands like is the this is
 

8019
02:22:22,479 --> 02:22:25,030
everyone understands like is the this is
the the universe of the problem and the

8020
02:22:25,030 --> 02:22:25,040
the the universe of the problem and the
 

8021
02:22:25,040 --> 02:22:26,469
the the universe of the problem and the
same maybe with that paper everyone

8022
02:22:26,469 --> 02:22:26,479
same maybe with that paper everyone
 

8023
02:22:26,479 --> 02:22:28,070
same maybe with that paper everyone
understands okay these are the starting

8024
02:22:28,070 --> 02:22:28,080
understands okay these are the starting
 

8025
02:22:28,080 --> 02:22:29,590
understands okay these are the starting
conditions

8026
02:22:29,590 --> 02:22:29,600
conditions
 

8027
02:22:29,600 --> 02:22:31,190
conditions
and um

8028
02:22:31,190 --> 02:22:31,200
and um
 

8029
02:22:31,200 --> 02:22:32,870
and um
and and yeah that the fact that it

8030
02:22:32,870 --> 02:22:32,880
and and yeah that the fact that it
 

8031
02:22:32,880 --> 02:22:34,550
and and yeah that the fact that it
becomes intellectually democrat and i

8032
02:22:34,550 --> 02:22:34,560
becomes intellectually democrat and i
 

8033
02:22:34,560 --> 02:22:36,469
becomes intellectually democrat and i
think that's a huge motivation

8034
02:22:36,469 --> 02:22:36,479
think that's a huge motivation
 

8035
02:22:36,479 --> 02:22:37,910
think that's a huge motivation
for people and that's why

8036
02:22:37,910 --> 02:22:37,920
for people and that's why
 

8037
02:22:37,920 --> 02:22:39,750
for people and that's why
so so many people gravitate towards

8038
02:22:39,750 --> 02:22:39,760
so so many people gravitate towards
 

8039
02:22:39,760 --> 02:22:41,270
so so many people gravitate towards
these like riemann hypotheses or

8040
02:22:41,270 --> 02:22:41,280
these like riemann hypotheses or
 

8041
02:22:41,280 --> 02:22:42,950
these like riemann hypotheses or
vermont's last theorem or that simple

8042
02:22:42,950 --> 02:22:42,960
vermont's last theorem or that simple
 

8043
02:22:42,960 --> 02:22:44,790
vermont's last theorem or that simple
paper which is like just one page it's

8044
02:22:44,790 --> 02:22:44,800
paper which is like just one page it's
 

8045
02:22:44,800 --> 02:22:45,990
paper which is like just one page it's
very simple

8046
02:22:45,990 --> 02:22:46,000
very simple
 

8047
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:47,910
very simple
and i just talked to somebody i don't

8048
02:22:47,910 --> 02:22:47,920
and i just talked to somebody i don't
 

8049
02:22:47,920 --> 02:22:50,070
and i just talked to somebody i don't
know if you know who he is jaco willink

8050
02:22:50,070 --> 02:22:50,080
know if you know who he is jaco willink
 

8051
02:22:50,080 --> 02:22:51,510
know if you know who he is jaco willink
who is uh

8052
02:22:51,510 --> 02:22:51,520
who is uh
 

8053
02:22:51,520 --> 02:22:53,190
who is uh
this person

8054
02:22:53,190 --> 02:22:53,200
this person
 

8055
02:22:53,200 --> 02:22:55,990
this person
who among many things loves military

8056
02:22:55,990 --> 02:22:56,000
who among many things loves military
 

8057
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:57,670
who among many things loves military
tactics so

8058
02:22:57,670 --> 02:22:57,680
tactics so
 

8059
02:22:57,680 --> 02:23:00,389
tactics so
he would probably either publish

8060
02:23:00,389 --> 02:23:00,399
he would probably either publish
 

8061
02:23:00,399 --> 02:23:01,910
he would probably either publish
a follow-on paper maybe you guys should

8062
02:23:01,910 --> 02:23:01,920
a follow-on paper maybe you guys should
 

8063
02:23:01,920 --> 02:23:03,990
a follow-on paper maybe you guys should
collaborate but he would see the

8064
02:23:03,990 --> 02:23:04,000
collaborate but he would see the
 

8065
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:05,670
collaborate but he would see the
fundament the basic assumptions that he

8066
02:23:05,670 --> 02:23:05,680
fundament the basic assumptions that he
 

8067
02:23:05,680 --> 02:23:07,990
fundament the basic assumptions that he
started that paper with is flawed

8068
02:23:07,990 --> 02:23:08,000
started that paper with is flawed
 

8069
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,070
started that paper with is flawed
because you know there's like dragons

8070
02:23:10,070 --> 02:23:10,080
because you know there's like dragons
 

8071
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:11,590
because you know there's like dragons
too right there's like

8072
02:23:11,590 --> 02:23:11,600
too right there's like
 

8073
02:23:11,600 --> 02:23:13,590
too right there's like
like you have to integrate tactics

8074
02:23:13,590 --> 02:23:13,600
like you have to integrate tactics
 

8075
02:23:13,600 --> 02:23:15,429
like you have to integrate tactics
because not it's not it's not a

8076
02:23:15,429 --> 02:23:15,439
because not it's not it's not a
 

8077
02:23:15,439 --> 02:23:16,950
because not it's not it's not a
homogeneous system

8078
02:23:16,950 --> 02:23:16,960
homogeneous system
 

8079
02:23:16,960 --> 02:23:18,469
homogeneous system
it's not you i don't take into account

8080
02:23:18,469 --> 02:23:18,479
it's not you i don't take into account
 

8081
02:23:18,479 --> 02:23:20,389
it's not you i don't take into account
the dragons and like and he would say

8082
02:23:20,389 --> 02:23:20,399
the dragons and like and he would say
 

8083
02:23:20,399 --> 02:23:21,750
the dragons and like and he would say
tactics fundamentally change the

8084
02:23:21,750 --> 02:23:21,760
tactics fundamentally change the
 

8085
02:23:21,760 --> 02:23:23,349
tactics fundamentally change the
dynamics of the system

8086
02:23:23,349 --> 02:23:23,359
dynamics of the system
 

8087
02:23:23,359 --> 02:23:24,389
dynamics of the system
and so like

8088
02:23:24,389 --> 02:23:24,399
and so like
 

8089
02:23:24,399 --> 02:23:27,590
and so like
that's what happened

8090
02:23:27,590 --> 02:23:27,600

 

8091
02:23:27,600 --> 02:23:30,230

so uh yeah so at least from a scientific

8092
02:23:30,230 --> 02:23:30,240
so uh yeah so at least from a scientific
 

8093
02:23:30,240 --> 02:23:31,830
so uh yeah so at least from a scientific
perspective he was right but he never

8094
02:23:31,830 --> 02:23:31,840
perspective he was right but he never
 

8095
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:33,750
perspective he was right but he never
published so there you go

8096
02:23:33,750 --> 02:23:33,760
published so there you go
 

8097
02:23:33,760 --> 02:23:35,110
published so there you go
uh let me ask the most important

8098
02:23:35,110 --> 02:23:35,120
uh let me ask the most important
 

8099
02:23:35,120 --> 02:23:37,110
uh let me ask the most important
question you guys are from

8100
02:23:37,110 --> 02:23:37,120
question you guys are from
 

8101
02:23:37,120 --> 02:23:39,990
question you guys are from
portugal both yeah

8102
02:23:39,990 --> 02:23:40,000
portugal both yeah
 

8103
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:40,870
portugal both yeah
so

8104
02:23:40,870 --> 02:23:40,880
so
 

8105
02:23:40,880 --> 02:23:43,270
so
who is the greatest soccer player

8106
02:23:43,270 --> 02:23:43,280
who is the greatest soccer player
 

8107
02:23:43,280 --> 02:23:45,510
who is the greatest soccer player
footballer of all time

8108
02:23:45,510 --> 02:23:45,520
footballer of all time
 

8109
02:23:45,520 --> 02:23:47,510
footballer of all time
yeah i think we're a little bit biased

8110
02:23:47,510 --> 02:23:47,520
yeah i think we're a little bit biased
 

8111
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:49,590
yeah i think we're a little bit biased
on this topic but uh i mean i have

8112
02:23:49,590 --> 02:23:49,600
on this topic but uh i mean i have
 

8113
02:23:49,600 --> 02:23:51,429
on this topic but uh i mean i have
maradona

8114
02:23:51,429 --> 02:23:51,439
maradona
 

8115
02:23:51,439 --> 02:23:53,830
maradona
i i have a huge i have a you know

8116
02:23:53,830 --> 02:23:53,840
i i have a huge i have a you know
 

8117
02:23:53,840 --> 02:23:56,550
i i have a huge i have a you know
tremendous respect for for what um here

8118
02:23:56,550 --> 02:23:56,560
tremendous respect for for what um here
 

8119
02:23:56,560 --> 02:23:58,070
tremendous respect for for what um here
we go

8120
02:23:58,070 --> 02:23:58,080
we go
 

8121
02:23:58,080 --> 02:23:59,830
we go
this is the political issue

8122
02:23:59,830 --> 02:23:59,840
this is the political issue
 

8123
02:23:59,840 --> 02:24:02,309
this is the political issue
we can convince you i i i mean i have

8124
02:24:02,309 --> 02:24:02,319
we can convince you i i i mean i have
 

8125
02:24:02,319 --> 02:24:04,150
we can convince you i i i mean i have

8157
02:24:38,960 --> 02:24:41,590
he he's known from being probably one of
the hardest working athletes in the game

and and i see that sometimes a lot of
 

8161
02:24:43,439 --> 02:24:45,510

these discussions about the best player

8162

these discussions about the best player
 

8163

a lot of people train tend to gravitate
 

8165
02:24:48,080 --> 02:24:50,389
a lot of people train tend to gravitate
towards like um you know this person is

8166
02:24:50,389 --> 02:24:50,399
towards like um you know this person is
 

8167
02:24:50,399 --> 02:24:52,790
towards like um you know this person is
naturally talented and the other person

8168
02:24:52,790 --> 02:24:52,800
naturally talented and the other person
 

8169
02:24:52,800 --> 02:24:56,469
naturally talented and the other person
has to work hard and so and so as if it

8170
02:24:56,469 --> 02:24:56,479
has to work hard and so and so as if it
 

8171
02:24:56,479 --> 02:24:58,950
has to work hard and so and so as if it
was bad if he had to work hard to to be

8172
02:24:58,950 --> 02:24:58,960
was bad if he had to work hard to to be
 

8173
02:24:58,960 --> 02:25:01,270
was bad if he had to work hard to to be
good at something and i think that you

8174
02:25:01,270 --> 02:25:01,280
good at something and i think that you
 

8175
02:25:01,280 --> 02:25:02,870
good at something and i think that you
know the the

8176
02:25:02,870 --> 02:25:02,880
know the the
 

8177
02:25:02,880 --> 02:25:05,270
know the the
i think so many people fall into that

8178
02:25:05,270 --> 02:25:05,280
i think so many people fall into that
 

8179
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:07,270
i think so many people fall into that
trap and the reason why so many people

8180
02:25:07,270 --> 02:25:07,280
trap and the reason why so many people
 

8181
02:25:07,280 --> 02:25:09,590
trap and the reason why so many people
fall into that trap is because if you

8182
02:25:09,590 --> 02:25:09,600
fall into that trap is because if you
 

8183
02:25:09,600 --> 02:25:11,670
fall into that trap is because if you
are saying that someone

8184
02:25:11,670 --> 02:25:11,680
are saying that someone
 

8185
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:14,469
are saying that someone
is good and achieved a lot of success by

8186
02:25:14,469 --> 02:25:14,479
is good and achieved a lot of success by
 

8187
02:25:14,479 --> 02:25:16,550
is good and achieved a lot of success by
working hard as opposed to achieving

8188
02:25:16,550 --> 02:25:16,560
working hard as opposed to achieving
 

8189
02:25:16,560 --> 02:25:18,309
working hard as opposed to achieving
success because it has some sort of

8190
02:25:18,309 --> 02:25:18,319
success because it has some sort of
 

8191
02:25:18,319 --> 02:25:21,190
success because it has some sort of
god-given natural talent then you can't

8192
02:25:21,190 --> 02:25:21,200
god-given natural talent then you can't
 

8193
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:22,710
god-given natural talent then you can't
explain why the person was born with

8194
02:25:22,710 --> 02:25:22,720
explain why the person was born with
 

8195
02:25:22,720 --> 02:25:23,510
explain why the person was born with
that

8196
02:25:23,510 --> 02:25:23,520
that
 

8197
02:25:23,520 --> 02:25:26,150
that
what does it tell you about you

8198
02:25:26,150 --> 02:25:26,160
what does it tell you about you
 

8199
02:25:26,160 --> 02:25:28,070
what does it tell you about you
it tells you that maybe if you work hard

8200
02:25:28,070 --> 02:25:28,080
it tells you that maybe if you work hard
 

8201
02:25:28,080 --> 02:25:29,910
it tells you that maybe if you work hard
on a lot of fields you could have

8202
02:25:29,910 --> 02:25:29,920
on a lot of fields you could have
 

8203
02:25:29,920 --> 02:25:31,670

lot of people

almost 40 yeah and how that sets up an
 

8345
02:27:57,600 --> 02:27:59,429
almost 40 yeah and how that sets up an
example like maybe 10 years ago i

or especially you know if you're

8442
02:29:40,070 --> 02:29:40,080
or especially you know if you're
 

8443
02:29:40,080 --> 02:29:42,150
or especially you know if you're
comparing messi and ronaldo that have

8444
02:29:42,150 --> 02:29:42,160
comparing messi and ronaldo that have
 

8445
02:29:42,160 --> 02:29:44,550
comparing messi and ronaldo that have
such different you know styles of play

8446
02:29:44,550 --> 02:29:44,560
such different you know styles of play
 

8447
02:29:44,560 --> 02:29:45,910
such different you know styles of play
and also even

8448
02:29:45,910 --> 02:29:45,920
and also even
 

8449
02:29:45,920 --> 02:29:47,990
and also even
their bodies are so different and and

8450
02:29:47,990 --> 02:29:48,000
their bodies are so different and and
 

8451
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:48,950
their bodies are so different and and
and but

8452
02:29:48,950 --> 02:29:48,960
and but
 

8453
02:29:48,960 --> 02:29:51,270
and but
these two

8454
02:29:51,270 --> 02:29:51,280
these two
 

8455
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:52,950
these two
very different players can be at the top

8456
02:29:52,950 --> 02:29:52,960
very different players can be at the top
 

8457
02:29:52,960 --> 02:29:56,309
very different players can be at the top
of the game and that's not that's the

8458
02:29:56,309 --> 02:29:56,319
of the game and that's not that's the
 

8459
02:29:56,319 --> 02:29:57,910
of the game and that's not that's the
they're not a lot of other sports where

8460
02:29:57,910 --> 02:29:57,920
they're not a lot of other sports where
 

8461
02:29:57,920 --> 02:29:59,830
they're not a lot of other sports where
you where you have that you know like

8462
02:29:59,830 --> 02:29:59,840
you where you have that you know like
 

8463
02:29:59,840 --> 02:30:01,990
you where you have that you know like
you have kind of a mental image of a

8464
02:30:01,990 --> 02:30:02,000
you have kind of a mental image of a
 

8465
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,870
you have kind of a mental image of a
basketball player and like the the top

8466
02:30:04,870 --> 02:30:04,880
basketball player and like the the top
 

8467
02:30:04,880 --> 02:30:06,630
basketball player and like the the top
basketball players kind of fit that

8468
02:30:06,630 --> 02:30:06,640
basketball players kind of fit that
 

8469
02:30:06,640 --> 02:30:08,389
basketball players kind of fit that
mental image and and they look a certain

8470
02:30:08,389 --> 02:30:08,399
mental image and and they look a certain
 

8471
02:30:08,399 --> 02:30:09,190
mental image and and they look a certain
way

8472
02:30:09,190 --> 02:30:09,200
way
 

8473
02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:10,469
way
and um

8474
02:30:10,469 --> 02:30:10,479
and um
 

8475
02:30:10,479 --> 02:30:13,750
and um
but for soccer there's so there's

8476
02:30:13,750 --> 02:30:13,760
but for soccer there's so there's
 

8477
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:15,830
but for soccer there's so there's
it's it's not so much like that and and

8478
02:30:15,830 --> 02:30:15,840
it's it's not so much like that and and
 

8479
02:30:15,840 --> 02:30:18,389
it's it's not so much like that and and
that's i think that's that's beautiful

8480
02:30:18,389 --> 02:30:18,399
that's i think that's that's beautiful
 

8481
02:30:18,399 --> 02:30:20,230
that's i think that's that's beautiful
uh but that's that really adds something

8482
02:30:20,230 --> 02:30:20,240
uh but that's that really adds something
 

8483
02:30:20,240 --> 02:30:21,429
uh but that's that really adds something
to the sport

8484
02:30:21,429 --> 02:30:21,439
to the sport
 

8485
02:30:21,439 --> 02:30:23,670
to the sport
well do you play soccer yourself have

8486
02:30:23,670 --> 02:30:23,680
well do you play soccer yourself have
 

8487
02:30:23,680 --> 02:30:25,590
well do you play soccer yourself have
you played that in your life what do you

8488
02:30:25,590 --> 02:30:25,600
you played that in your life what do you
 

8489
02:30:25,600 --> 02:30:27,270
you played that in your life what do you
find beautiful about the game yeah i

8490
02:30:27,270 --> 02:30:27,280
find beautiful about the game yeah i
 

8491
02:30:27,280 --> 02:30:29,030
find beautiful about the game yeah i
mean it's one of the i'd say it's the

8492
02:30:29,030 --> 02:30:29,040
mean it's one of the i'd say it's the
 

8493
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:31,510
mean it's one of the i'd say it's the
biggest sport in portugal and so growing

8494
02:30:31,510 --> 02:30:31,520
biggest sport in portugal and so growing
 

8495
02:30:31,520 --> 02:30:33,670
biggest sport in portugal and so growing
up we played a lot did you see the paper

8496
02:30:33,670 --> 02:30:33,680
up we played a lot did you see the paper
 

8497
02:30:33,680 --> 02:30:35,670
up we played a lot did you see the paper
from deepmind i didn't look at it where

8498
02:30:35,670 --> 02:30:35,680
from deepmind i didn't look at it where
 

8499
02:30:35,680 --> 02:30:38,790
from deepmind i didn't look at it where
they're like uh doing some uh analysis

8500
02:30:38,790 --> 02:30:38,800
they're like uh doing some uh analysis
 

8501
02:30:38,800 --> 02:30:41,670
they're like uh doing some uh analysis
on soccer strategy yeah interesting i

8502
02:30:41,670 --> 02:30:41,680
on soccer strategy yeah interesting i
 

8503
02:30:41,680 --> 02:30:43,830
on soccer strategy yeah interesting i
saved that paper uh i haven't read it

8504
02:30:43,830 --> 02:30:43,840
saved that paper uh i haven't read it
 

8505
02:30:43,840 --> 02:30:46,950
saved that paper uh i haven't read it
yet um it's actually i i when i was in

8506
02:30:46,950 --> 02:30:46,960
yet um it's actually i i when i was in
 

8507
02:30:46,960 --> 02:30:49,670
yet um it's actually i i when i was in
college i actually did some

8508
02:30:49,670 --> 02:30:49,680
college i actually did some
 

8509
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:52,870
college i actually did some
research on on applying um

8510
02:30:52,870 --> 02:30:52,880
research on on applying um
 

8511
02:30:52,880 --> 02:30:54,389
research on on applying um
machine learning and statistics in

8512
02:30:54,389 --> 02:30:54,399
machine learning and statistics in
 

8513
02:30:54,399 --> 02:30:57,110
machine learning and statistics in
sports and in our ca in our case we're

8514
02:30:57,110 --> 02:30:57,120
sports and in our ca in our case we're
 

8515
02:30:57,120 --> 02:30:59,510
sports and in our ca in our case we're
doing it for basketball

8516
02:30:59,510 --> 02:30:59,520
doing it for basketball
 

8517
02:30:59,520 --> 02:31:01,510
doing it for basketball
but uh

8518
02:31:01,510 --> 02:31:01,520
but uh
 

8519
02:31:01,520 --> 02:31:03,190
but uh
what they're effectively trying to do

8520
02:31:03,190 --> 02:31:03,200
what they're effectively trying to do
 

8521
02:31:03,200 --> 02:31:04,309
what they're effectively trying to do
was

8522
02:31:04,309 --> 02:31:04,319
was
 

8523
02:31:04,319 --> 02:31:06,230
was
have you ever watched moneyball like

8524
02:31:06,230 --> 02:31:06,240
have you ever watched moneyball like
 

8525
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:07,750
have you ever watched moneyball like
yeah so they're trying to do something

8526
02:31:07,750 --> 02:31:07,760
yeah so they're trying to do something
 

8527
02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:08,950
yeah so they're trying to do something
similar to

8528
02:31:08,950 --> 02:31:08,960
similar to
 

8529
02:31:08,960 --> 02:31:10,630
similar to
taking that in this case basketball

8530
02:31:10,630 --> 02:31:10,640
taking that in this case basketball
 

8531
02:31:10,640 --> 02:31:12,870
taking that in this case basketball
taking a statistical approach to

8532
02:31:12,870 --> 02:31:12,880
taking a statistical approach to
 

8533
02:31:12,880 --> 02:31:15,270
taking a statistical approach to
to to basketball um

8534
02:31:15,270 --> 02:31:15,280
to to basketball um
 

8535
02:31:15,280 --> 02:31:17,030
to to basketball um
the interesting thing there is that

8536
02:31:17,030 --> 02:31:17,040
the interesting thing there is that
 

8537
02:31:17,040 --> 02:31:19,190
the interesting thing there is that
baseball is much more about having these

8538
02:31:19,190 --> 02:31:19,200
baseball is much more about having these
 

8539
02:31:19,200 --> 02:31:21,110
baseball is much more about having these
discrete events that happen kind of in

8540
02:31:21,110 --> 02:31:21,120
discrete events that happen kind of in
 

8541
02:31:21,120 --> 02:31:23,190
discrete events that happen kind of in
similar conditions and so it's easier to

8542
02:31:23,190 --> 02:31:23,200
similar conditions and so it's easier to
 

8543
02:31:23,200 --> 02:31:25,190
similar conditions and so it's easier to
take a statistical approach to it

8544
02:31:25,190 --> 02:31:25,200
take a statistical approach to it
 

8545
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:27,190
take a statistical approach to it
whereas basketball is a much more

8546
02:31:27,190 --> 02:31:27,200
whereas basketball is a much more
 

8547
02:31:27,200 --> 02:31:28,790
whereas basketball is a much more
dynamic game

8548
02:31:28,790 --> 02:31:28,800
dynamic game
 

8549
02:31:28,800 --> 02:31:30,550
dynamic game
it's harder to measure

8550
02:31:30,550 --> 02:31:30,560
it's harder to measure
 

8551
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:31,830
it's harder to measure
um

8552
02:31:31,830 --> 02:31:31,840
um
 

8553
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:33,429
um
it's hard to to replicate these

8554
02:31:33,429 --> 02:31:33,439
it's hard to to replicate these
 

8555
02:31:33,439 --> 02:31:35,110
it's hard to to replicate these
conditions and so

8556
02:31:35,110 --> 02:31:35,120
conditions and so
 

8557
02:31:35,120 --> 02:31:37,270
conditions and so
you you have to think about it in a

8558
02:31:37,270 --> 02:31:37,280
you you have to think about it in a
 

8559
02:31:37,280 --> 02:31:39,190
you you have to think about it in a
slightly different way and so we were

8560
02:31:39,190 --> 02:31:39,200
slightly different way and so we were
 

8561
02:31:39,200 --> 02:31:41,510
slightly different way and so we were
doing work on that and working like with

8562
02:31:41,510 --> 02:31:41,520
doing work on that and working like with
 

8563
02:31:41,520 --> 02:31:44,070
doing work on that and working like with
the celtics to analyze the the the data

8564
02:31:44,070 --> 02:31:44,080
the celtics to analyze the the the data
 

8565
02:31:44,080 --> 02:31:45,190
the celtics to analyze the the the data
that they had like they had these

8566
02:31:45,190 --> 02:31:45,200
that they had like they had these
 

8567
02:31:45,200 --> 02:31:46,710
that they had like they had these
cameras in the in the arena they were

8568
02:31:46,710 --> 02:31:46,720
cameras in the in the arena they were
 

8569
02:31:46,720 --> 02:31:48,710
cameras in the in the arena they were
tracking the players and so you so they

8570
02:31:48,710 --> 02:31:48,720
tracking the players and so you so they
 

8571
02:31:48,720 --> 02:31:49,990
tracking the players and so you so they
have they had a ton of data but they

8572
02:31:49,990 --> 02:31:50,000
have they had a ton of data but they
 

8573
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:51,590
have they had a ton of data but they
didn't really know what to do with it

8574
02:31:51,590 --> 02:31:51,600
didn't really know what to do with it
 

8575
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:54,309
didn't really know what to do with it
and so we were doing work on that and

8576
02:31:54,309 --> 02:31:54,319
and so we were doing work on that and
 

8577
02:31:54,319 --> 02:31:57,030
and so we were doing work on that and
and and soccer is maybe an even a step

8578
02:31:57,030 --> 02:31:57,040
and and soccer is maybe an even a step
 

8579
02:31:57,040 --> 02:31:58,790
and and soccer is maybe an even a step
further it's it's right it's a game

8580
02:31:58,790 --> 02:31:58,800
further it's it's right it's a game
 

8581
02:31:58,800 --> 02:32:00,469
further it's it's right it's a game
where you don't have as many

8582
02:32:00,469 --> 02:32:00,479
where you don't have as many
 

8583
02:32:00,479 --> 02:32:02,309
where you don't have as many
in in basketball you have a lot of field

8584
02:32:02,309 --> 02:32:02,319
in in basketball you have a lot of field
 

8585
02:32:02,319 --> 02:32:04,950
in in basketball you have a lot of field
goals and so you can measure success uh

8586
02:32:04,950 --> 02:32:04,960
goals and so you can measure success uh
 

8587
02:32:04,960 --> 02:32:07,030
goals and so you can measure success uh
soccer it's it's right it's more of a

8588
02:32:07,030 --> 02:32:07,040
soccer it's it's right it's more of a
 

8589
02:32:07,040 --> 02:32:09,590
soccer it's it's right it's more of a
poisson process almost where it's like

8590
02:32:09,590 --> 02:32:09,600
poisson process almost where it's like
 

8591
02:32:09,600 --> 02:32:11,830
poisson process almost where it's like
you have a goal like or two and again in

8592
02:32:11,830 --> 02:32:11,840
you have a goal like or two and again in
 

8593
02:32:11,840 --> 02:32:13,510
you have a goal like or two and again in
terms of metrics i wonder if there's a

8594
02:32:13,510 --> 02:32:13,520
terms of metrics i wonder if there's a
 

8595
02:32:13,520 --> 02:32:15,270
terms of metrics i wonder if there's a
way and i've actually have thought about

8596
02:32:15,270 --> 02:32:15,280
way and i've actually have thought about
 

8597
02:32:15,280 --> 02:32:17,030
way and i've actually have thought about
this in the past never coming up with

8598
02:32:17,030 --> 02:32:17,040
this in the past never coming up with
 

8599
02:32:17,040 --> 02:32:19,110
this in the past never coming up with
any good solution if there's a way to

8600
02:32:19,110 --> 02:32:19,120
any good solution if there's a way to
 

8601
02:32:19,120 --> 02:32:20,870
any good solution if there's a way to
definitively say whether it's messier

8602
02:32:20,870 --> 02:32:20,880
definitively say whether it's messier
 

8603
02:32:20,880 --> 02:32:22,870
definitively say whether it's messier
and now they're the greatest of all time

8604
02:32:22,870 --> 02:32:22,880
and now they're the greatest of all time
 

8605
02:32:22,880 --> 02:32:24,550
and now they're the greatest of all time
like honestly sort of measure

8606
02:32:24,550 --> 02:32:24,560
like honestly sort of measure
 

8607
02:32:24,560 --> 02:32:25,590
like honestly sort of measure
interesting

8608
02:32:25,590 --> 02:32:25,600
interesting
 

8609
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:27,670
interesting
like convert the game of soccer into

8610
02:32:27,670 --> 02:32:27,680
like convert the game of soccer into
 

8611
02:32:27,680 --> 02:32:29,830
like convert the game of soccer into
metrics like you said baseball but like

8612
02:32:29,830 --> 02:32:29,840
metrics like you said baseball but like
 

8613
02:32:29,840 --> 02:32:33,750
metrics like you said baseball but like
those moments of genius like pat like um

8614
02:32:33,750 --> 02:32:33,760
those moments of genius like pat like um
 

8615
02:32:33,760 --> 02:32:35,510
those moments of genius like pat like um
you know if it's just about goals or

8616
02:32:35,510 --> 02:32:35,520
you know if it's just about goals or
 

8617
02:32:35,520 --> 02:32:37,670
you know if it's just about goals or
passes that led to goals that feels like

8618
02:32:37,670 --> 02:32:37,680
passes that led to goals that feels like
 

8619
02:32:37,680 --> 02:32:40,070
passes that led to goals that feels like
it doesn't capture the genius of them

8620
02:32:40,070 --> 02:32:40,080
it doesn't capture the genius of them
 

8621
02:32:40,080 --> 02:32:43,270
it doesn't capture the genius of them
yeah they'll be like you know like

8622
02:32:43,270 --> 02:32:43,280
yeah they'll be like you know like
 

8623
02:32:43,280 --> 02:32:45,110
yeah they'll be like you know like
like you kind of do you have more

8624
02:32:45,110 --> 02:32:45,120
like you kind of do you have more
 

8625
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:47,349
like you kind of do you have more
metrics for instance in chess right and

8626
02:32:47,349 --> 02:32:47,359
metrics for instance in chess right and
 

8627
02:32:47,359 --> 02:32:49,510
metrics for instance in chess right and
you can try to understand how hard of a

8628
02:32:49,510 --> 02:32:49,520
you can try to understand how hard of a
 

8629
02:32:49,520 --> 02:32:50,790
you can try to understand how hard of a
move

8630
02:32:50,790 --> 02:32:50,800
move
 

8631
02:32:50,800 --> 02:32:52,710
move
there was you know there's like bobby

8632
02:32:52,710 --> 02:32:52,720
there was you know there's like bobby
 

8633
02:32:52,720 --> 02:32:54,790
there was you know there's like bobby
fischer has this move that like

8634
02:32:54,790 --> 02:32:54,800
fischer has this move that like
 

8635
02:32:54,800 --> 02:32:56,630
fischer has this move that like
that it's i think it's called the move

8636
02:32:56,630 --> 02:32:56,640
that it's i think it's called the move
 

8637
02:32:56,640 --> 02:32:59,190
that it's i think it's called the move
of the century where uh

8638
02:32:59,190 --> 02:32:59,200
of the century where uh
 

8639
02:32:59,200 --> 02:33:01,190
of the century where uh
you have to go so deep into the tree to

8640
02:33:01,190 --> 02:33:01,200
you have to go so deep into the tree to
 

8641
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:02,469
you have to go so deep into the tree to
understand that that was the right move

8642
02:33:02,469 --> 02:33:02,479
understand that that was the right move
 

8643
02:33:02,479 --> 02:33:05,510
understand that that was the right move
and you can quantify it how hard it was

8644
02:33:05,510 --> 02:33:05,520
and you can quantify it how hard it was
 

8645
02:33:05,520 --> 02:33:06,790
and you can quantify it how hard it was
so it'd be interesting to try to think

8646
02:33:06,790 --> 02:33:06,800
so it'd be interesting to try to think
 

8647
02:33:06,800 --> 02:33:08,389
so it'd be interesting to try to think
of those type of metrics but say yeah

8648
02:33:08,389 --> 02:33:08,399
of those type of metrics but say yeah
 

8649
02:33:08,399 --> 02:33:10,389
of those type of metrics but say yeah
for soccer computer vision unlocks some

8650
02:33:10,389 --> 02:33:10,399
for soccer computer vision unlocks some
 

8651
02:33:10,399 --> 02:33:11,670
for soccer computer vision unlocks some
of that for us that's that's one

8652
02:33:11,670 --> 02:33:11,680
of that for us that's that's one
 

8653
02:33:11,680 --> 02:33:13,590
of that for us that's that's one
possibility i have a cool idea a

8654
02:33:13,590 --> 02:33:13,600
possibility i have a cool idea a
 

8655
02:33:13,600 --> 02:33:15,830
possibility i have a cool idea a
computer vision product likes that you

8656
02:33:15,830 --> 02:33:15,840
computer vision product likes that you
 

8657
02:33:15,840 --> 02:33:18,230
computer vision product likes that you
could build for soccer

8658
02:33:18,230 --> 02:33:18,240
could build for soccer
 

8659
02:33:18,240 --> 02:33:19,830
could build for soccer
i'm taking notes

8660
02:33:19,830 --> 02:33:19,840
i'm taking notes
 

8661
02:33:19,840 --> 02:33:22,230
i'm taking notes
if you could detect the ball and like

8662
02:33:22,230 --> 02:33:22,240
if you could detect the ball and like
 

8663
02:33:22,240 --> 02:33:25,110
if you could detect the ball and like
imagine that um this seems like totally

8664
02:33:25,110 --> 02:33:25,120
imagine that um this seems like totally
 

8665
02:33:25,120 --> 02:33:27,349
imagine that um this seems like totally
doable right now but like if you could

8666
02:33:27,349 --> 02:33:27,359
doable right now but like if you could
 

8667
02:33:27,359 --> 02:33:29,190
doable right now but like if you could
detect when the ball enters one of the

8668
02:33:29,190 --> 02:33:29,200
detect when the ball enters one of the
 

8669
02:33:29,200 --> 02:33:32,469
detect when the ball enters one of the
goals and like just had like um you know

8670
02:33:32,469 --> 02:33:32,479
goals and like just had like um you know
 

8671
02:33:32,479 --> 02:33:34,309
goals and like just had like um you know
a crowd cheering for you when you're

8672
02:33:34,309 --> 02:33:34,319
a crowd cheering for you when you're
 

8673
02:33:34,319 --> 02:33:35,750
a crowd cheering for you when you're
playing soccer with your friends every

8674
02:33:35,750 --> 02:33:35,760
playing soccer with your friends every
 

8675
02:33:35,760 --> 02:33:37,429
playing soccer with your friends every
time you score a goal or you had like

8676
02:33:37,429 --> 02:33:37,439
time you score a goal or you had like
 

8677
02:33:37,439 --> 02:33:39,910
time you score a goal or you had like
the the champions league song going on

8678
02:33:39,910 --> 02:33:39,920
the the champions league song going on
 

8679
02:33:39,920 --> 02:33:41,910
the the champions league song going on
yeah and like having that like you go

8680
02:33:41,910 --> 02:33:41,920
yeah and like having that like you go
 

8681
02:33:41,920 --> 02:33:43,110
yeah and like having that like you go
play soccer with your friends you just

8682
02:33:43,110 --> 02:33:43,120
play soccer with your friends you just
 

8683
02:33:43,120 --> 02:33:44,790
play soccer with your friends you just
turn that on and there's like a computer

8684
02:33:44,790 --> 02:33:44,800
turn that on and there's like a computer
 

8685
02:33:44,800 --> 02:33:46,950
turn that on and there's like a computer
vision like program analyzes the ball

8686
02:33:46,950 --> 02:33:46,960
vision like program analyzes the ball
 

8687
02:33:46,960 --> 02:33:48,150
vision like program analyzes the ball
detects the ball every time there's a

8688
02:33:48,150 --> 02:33:48,160
detects the ball every time there's a
 

8689
02:33:48,160 --> 02:33:50,150
detects the ball every time there's a
goal like if you miss like there's a you

8690
02:33:50,150 --> 02:33:50,160
goal like if you miss like there's a you
 

8691
02:33:50,160 --> 02:33:52,150
goal like if you miss like there's a you
know the fans are reacting to that and

8692
02:33:52,150 --> 02:33:52,160
know the fans are reacting to that and
 

8693
02:33:52,160 --> 02:33:52,950
know the fans are reacting to that and
then

8694
02:33:52,950 --> 02:33:52,960
then
 

8695
02:33:52,960 --> 02:33:54,630
then
it should be pretty simple by now it's

8696
02:33:54,630 --> 02:33:54,640
it should be pretty simple by now it's
 

8697
02:33:54,640 --> 02:33:56,070
it should be pretty simple by now it's
like i think there's an opportunity

8698
02:33:56,070 --> 02:33:56,080
like i think there's an opportunity
 

8699
02:33:56,080 --> 02:33:58,309
like i think there's an opportunity
there so yeah just throwing that i would

8700
02:33:58,309 --> 02:33:58,319
there so yeah just throwing that i would
 

8701
02:33:58,319 --> 02:34:01,110
there so yeah just throwing that i would
go all out but by the way i did uh i've

8702
02:34:01,110 --> 02:34:01,120
go all out but by the way i did uh i've
 

8703
02:34:01,120 --> 02:34:02,790
go all out but by the way i did uh i've
never released i was thinking of just

8704
02:34:02,790 --> 02:34:02,800
never released i was thinking of just
 

8705
02:34:02,800 --> 02:34:04,309
never released i was thinking of just
putting on github but i did write

8706
02:34:04,309 --> 02:34:04,319
putting on github but i did write
 

8707
02:34:04,319 --> 02:34:05,910
putting on github but i did write
exactly that which is the trackers for

8708
02:34:05,910 --> 02:34:05,920
exactly that which is the trackers for
 

8709
02:34:05,920 --> 02:34:07,110
exactly that which is the trackers for
the players

8710
02:34:07,110 --> 02:34:07,120
the players
 

8711
02:34:07,120 --> 02:34:08,950
the players
uh for the for the bodies of the player

8712
02:34:08,950 --> 02:34:08,960
uh for the for the bodies of the player
 

8713
02:34:08,960 --> 02:34:11,590
uh for the for the bodies of the player
it's this is the hard part actually

8714
02:34:11,590 --> 02:34:11,600
it's this is the hard part actually
 

8715
02:34:11,600 --> 02:34:14,150
it's this is the hard part actually
the detection of player bodies and the

8716
02:34:14,150 --> 02:34:14,160
the detection of player bodies and the
 

8717
02:34:14,160 --> 02:34:16,950
the detection of player bodies and the
ball is not hard what's hard is

8718
02:34:16,950 --> 02:34:16,960
ball is not hard what's hard is
 

8719
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:20,389
ball is not hard what's hard is
very like robust tracking through time

8720
02:34:20,389 --> 02:34:20,399
very like robust tracking through time
 

8721
02:34:20,399 --> 02:34:21,750
very like robust tracking through time
of each of those

8722
02:34:21,750 --> 02:34:21,760
of each of those
 

8723
02:34:21,760 --> 02:34:23,990
of each of those
so like so i wrote a track of this

8724
02:34:23,990 --> 02:34:24,000
so like so i wrote a track of this
 

8725
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,389
so like so i wrote a track of this
pretty damn good this is this is that is

8726
02:34:26,389 --> 02:34:26,399
pretty damn good this is this is that is
 

8727
02:34:26,399 --> 02:34:27,830
pretty damn good this is this is that is
that open source

8728
02:34:27,830 --> 02:34:27,840
that open source
 

8729
02:34:27,840 --> 02:34:29,190
that open source
i know i've never released it because

8730
02:34:29,190 --> 02:34:29,200
i know i've never released it because
 

8731
02:34:29,200 --> 02:34:30,309
i know i've never released it because
that's interesting because i thought

8732
02:34:30,309 --> 02:34:30,319
that's interesting because i thought
 

8733
02:34:30,319 --> 02:34:31,910
that's interesting because i thought
like

8734
02:34:31,910 --> 02:34:31,920
like
 

8735
02:34:31,920 --> 02:34:34,630
like
i need to i would

8736
02:34:34,630 --> 02:34:34,640
i need to i would
 

8737
02:34:34,640 --> 02:34:36,230
i need to i would
this is the perfection thing because i

8738
02:34:36,230 --> 02:34:36,240
this is the perfection thing because i
 

8739
02:34:36,240 --> 02:34:38,230
this is the perfection thing because i
knew it was going to be like

8740
02:34:38,230 --> 02:34:38,240
knew it was going to be like
 

8741
02:34:38,240 --> 02:34:40,070
knew it was going to be like
it's going to pull me in and and it

8742
02:34:40,070 --> 02:34:40,080
it's going to pull me in and and it
 

8743
02:34:40,080 --> 02:34:42,230
it's going to pull me in and and it
wasn't really that done

8744
02:34:42,230 --> 02:34:42,240
wasn't really that done
 

8745
02:34:42,240 --> 02:34:44,150
wasn't really that done
and so i've never actually been part of

8746
02:34:44,150 --> 02:34:44,160
and so i've never actually been part of
 

8747
02:34:44,160 --> 02:34:46,070
and so i've never actually been part of
a github project where it's like really

8748
02:34:46,070 --> 02:34:46,080
a github project where it's like really
 

8749
02:34:46,080 --> 02:34:48,230
a github project where it's like really
active development and i didn't want to

8750
02:34:48,230 --> 02:34:48,240
active development and i didn't want to
 

8751
02:34:48,240 --> 02:34:50,309
active development and i didn't want to
make it i knew there's a non-zero

8752
02:34:50,309 --> 02:34:50,319
make it i knew there's a non-zero
 

8753
02:34:50,319 --> 02:34:52,150
make it i knew there's a non-zero
probability that will become my life for

8754

probability that will become my life for
 

8755
02:34:52,160 --> 02:34:53,510
probability that will become my life for
like a half a year

8756

ultimately it will be all for just the
the joy

8764
02:35:01,590 --> 02:35:01,600
the joy
 

8765
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:03,910
the joy
of analyzing the game which i'm all for

8766
02:35:03,910 --> 02:35:03,920
of analyzing the game which i'm all for
 

8767
02:35:03,920 --> 02:35:05,510

8771
02:35:06,720 --> 02:35:08,870
of the episodes you mentioned that you
did also a lot of eye tracking analysis

8772
02:35:08,870 --> 02:35:08,880
did also a lot of eye tracking analysis
 

8773
02:35:08,880 --> 02:35:11,030
did also a lot of eye tracking analysis
like joe rogan's that was the that was

8774
02:35:11,030 --> 02:35:11,040
like joe rogan's that was the that was
 

8775
02:35:11,040 --> 02:35:13,190
like joe rogan's that was the that was

8793
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:32,070
i might ask you for for access to that
to allegedly that library uh but i was

8794
02:35:32,070 --> 02:35:32,080
to allegedly that library uh but i was
 

8795
02:35:32,080 --> 02:35:34,309
to allegedly that library uh but i was
doing some not not regarding like eye

8796
02:35:34,309 --> 02:35:34,319
doing some not not regarding like eye
 

8797
02:35:34,319 --> 02:35:35,670
doing some not not regarding like eye
tracking but i was

8798
02:35:35,670 --> 02:35:35,680
tracking but i was
 

8799
02:35:35,680 --> 02:35:38,070
tracking but i was
playing around with um analyzing the

8800
02:35:38,070 --> 02:35:38,080
playing around with um analyzing the
 

8801
02:35:38,080 --> 02:35:40,870
playing around with um analyzing the
distribution of silences on uh one of

8802
02:35:40,870 --> 02:35:40,880
distribution of silences on uh one of
 

8803
02:35:40,880 --> 02:35:43,429
distribution of silences on uh one of
the joe rogan episodes so like i did

8804
02:35:43,429 --> 02:35:43,439
the joe rogan episodes so like i did
 

8805
02:35:43,439 --> 02:35:45,270
the joe rogan episodes so like i did
that for the elon

8806
02:35:45,270 --> 02:35:45,280
that for the elon
 

8807
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:47,270
that for the elon
conversation where it's like you just

8808
02:35:47,270 --> 02:35:47,280
conversation where it's like you just
 

8809
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:48,950
conversation where it's like you just
take all the silences

8810
02:35:48,950 --> 02:35:48,960
take all the silences
 

8811
02:35:48,960 --> 02:35:50,630
take all the silences
like after joe asked the question and

8812
02:35:50,630 --> 02:35:50,640
like after joe asked the question and
 

8813
02:35:50,640 --> 02:35:52,870
like after joe asked the question and
elon responded and you plot that

8814
02:35:52,870 --> 02:35:52,880
elon responded and you plot that
 

8815
02:35:52,880 --> 02:35:55,910
elon responded and you plot that
distribution and like and see how

8816
02:35:55,910 --> 02:35:55,920
distribution and like and see how
 

8817
02:35:55,920 --> 02:35:57,990
distribution and like and see how
how that looks like yeah i think there's

8818
02:35:57,990 --> 02:35:58,000
how that looks like yeah i think there's
 

8819
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,150
how that looks like yeah i think there's
a huge opportunity especially long-form

8820
02:36:00,150 --> 02:36:00,160
a huge opportunity especially long-form
 

8821
02:36:00,160 --> 02:36:02,070
a huge opportunity especially long-form
podcasts

8822
02:36:02,070 --> 02:36:02,080
podcasts
 

8823
02:36:02,080 --> 02:36:03,910
podcasts
to do that kind of analysis bigger than

8824
02:36:03,910 --> 02:36:03,920
to do that kind of analysis bigger than
 

8825
02:36:03,920 --> 02:36:06,550
to do that kind of analysis bigger than
joe exactly but it has to be a fairly

8826
02:36:06,550 --> 02:36:06,560
joe exactly but it has to be a fairly
 

8827
02:36:06,560 --> 02:36:09,030
joe exactly but it has to be a fairly
unedited podcasts so that you don't cut

8828
02:36:09,030 --> 02:36:09,040
unedited podcasts so that you don't cut
 

8829
02:36:09,040 --> 02:36:10,550
unedited podcasts so that you don't cut
the silence so one of the benefits i

8830
02:36:10,550 --> 02:36:10,560
the silence so one of the benefits i
 

8831
02:36:10,560 --> 02:36:13,349
the silence so one of the benefits i
have like doing this podcast is like the

8832
02:36:13,349 --> 02:36:13,359
have like doing this podcast is like the
 

8833
02:36:13,359 --> 02:36:14,790
have like doing this podcast is like the
the what we're recording today is

8834
02:36:14,790 --> 02:36:14,800
the what we're recording today is
 

8835
02:36:14,800 --> 02:36:15,830
the what we're recording today is
there's

8836
02:36:15,830 --> 02:36:15,840
there's
 

8837
02:36:15,840 --> 02:36:17,670
there's
individual audio

8838
02:36:17,670 --> 02:36:17,680
individual audio
 

8839
02:36:17,680 --> 02:36:18,950
individual audio
being recorded

8840
02:36:18,950 --> 02:36:18,960
being recorded
 

8841
02:36:18,960 --> 02:36:21,190
being recorded
like i have the raw information no it's

8842
02:36:21,190 --> 02:36:21,200
like i have the raw information no it's
 

8843
02:36:21,200 --> 02:36:22,630
like i have the raw information no it's
when it's published it's all combined

8844
02:36:22,630 --> 02:36:22,640
when it's published it's all combined
 

8845
02:36:22,640 --> 02:36:24,710
when it's published it's all combined
together and individual video feeds so

8846
02:36:24,710 --> 02:36:24,720
together and individual video feeds so
 

8847
02:36:24,720 --> 02:36:26,710
together and individual video feeds so
even when you're listening which i

8848
02:36:26,710 --> 02:36:26,720
even when you're listening which i
 

8849
02:36:26,720 --> 02:36:28,309
even when you're listening which i
usually don't i only show one video

8850
02:36:28,309 --> 02:36:28,319
usually don't i only show one video
 

8851
02:36:28,319 --> 02:36:29,429
usually don't i only show one video
stream

8852
02:36:29,429 --> 02:36:29,439
stream
 

8853
02:36:29,439 --> 02:36:32,309
stream
i i'll know i can track your blinks and

8854
02:36:32,309 --> 02:36:32,319
i i'll know i can track your blinks and
 

8855
02:36:32,319 --> 02:36:33,270
i i'll know i can track your blinks and
so on

8856
02:36:33,270 --> 02:36:33,280
so on
 

8857
02:36:33,280 --> 02:36:36,710
so on
um but yeah but ultimately the hope is

8858
02:36:36,710 --> 02:36:36,720
um but yeah but ultimately the hope is
 

8859
02:36:36,720 --> 02:36:38,550
um but yeah but ultimately the hope is
you don't need that raw data because if

8860
02:36:38,550 --> 02:36:38,560
you don't need that raw data because if
 

8861
02:36:38,560 --> 02:36:39,910
you don't need that raw data because if
you don't need the raw data for whatever

8862
02:36:39,910 --> 02:36:39,920
you don't need the raw data for whatever
 

8863
02:36:39,920 --> 02:36:41,349
you don't need the raw data for whatever
analysis you're doing

8864
02:36:41,349 --> 02:36:41,359
analysis you're doing
 

8865
02:36:41,359 --> 02:36:43,190
analysis you're doing
you can then do a huge number of

8866
02:36:43,190 --> 02:36:43,200
you can then do a huge number of
 

8867
02:36:43,200 --> 02:36:45,030
you can then do a huge number of
products because there's so it's quickly

8868
02:36:45,030 --> 02:36:45,040
products because there's so it's quickly
 

8869
02:36:45,040 --> 02:36:46,389
products because there's so it's quickly
growing now the number especially

8870
02:36:46,389 --> 02:36:46,399
growing now the number especially
 

8871
02:36:46,399 --> 02:36:47,750
growing now the number especially
comedians

8872
02:36:47,750 --> 02:36:47,760
comedians
 

8873
02:36:47,760 --> 02:36:49,349
comedians
there's uh quite a few comedians with

8874
02:36:49,349 --> 02:36:49,359
there's uh quite a few comedians with
 

8875
02:36:49,359 --> 02:36:51,750
there's uh quite a few comedians with

02:36:51,750 --> 02:36:51,760
with long-form podcasts
 

8877
02:36:51,760 --> 02:36:53,190
with long-form podcasts
and

8878
02:36:53,190 --> 02:36:53,200
and
 

8879
02:36:53,200 --> 02:36:54,790

kinds of things and it's it's prone for

8884
02:36:58,389 --> 02:36:58,399
kinds of things and it's it's prone for
 

8885
02:36:58,399 --> 02:37:00,870
kinds of things and it's it's prone for
analysis yeah and it's there's so many

8886
02:37:00,870 --> 02:37:00,880
analysis yeah and it's there's so many
 

8887
02:37:00,880 --> 02:37:02,309
analysis yeah and it's there's so many
interesting things that

8888
02:37:02,309 --> 02:37:02,319
interesting things that
 

8889
02:37:02,319 --> 02:37:04,150
interesting things that
that that idea actually sparked because

8890
02:37:04,150 --> 02:37:04,160
that that idea actually sparked because
 

8891
02:37:04,160 --> 02:37:05,510
that that idea actually sparked because
i was watching a

02:37:24,630 --> 02:37:24,640
answering the question i like i had to
 

8913
02:37:24,640 --> 02:37:27,030
answering the question i like i had to
check if the if the video hadn't paused

8914
02:37:27,030 --> 02:37:27,040
check if the if the video hadn't paused
 

8915
02:37:27,040 --> 02:37:28,389
check if the if the video hadn't paused
or something

8916
02:37:28,389 --> 02:37:28,399
or something
 

8917
02:37:28,399 --> 02:37:31,429
or something
and and i was thinking about like like

8918
02:37:31,429 --> 02:37:31,439
and and i was thinking about like like
 

8919
02:37:31,439 --> 02:37:33,510
and and i was thinking about like like
if that is a feature of a person like

8920
02:37:33,510 --> 02:37:33,520
if that is a feature of a person like
 

8921
02:37:33,520 --> 02:37:35,910
if that is a feature of a person like
how long on average you take to respond

8922
02:37:35,910 --> 02:37:35,920
how long on average you take to respond
 

8923
02:37:35,920 --> 02:37:38,070
how long on average you take to respond
to a question and if it's like that's

8924
02:37:38,070 --> 02:37:38,080
to a question and if it's like that's
 

8925
02:37:38,080 --> 02:37:39,590
to a question and if it's like that's
fascinating it has to do with it like

8926
02:37:39,590 --> 02:37:39,600
fascinating it has to do with it like
 

8927
02:37:39,600 --> 02:37:41,270
fascinating it has to do with it like
how thoughtful you are and if that

8928
02:37:41,270 --> 02:37:41,280
how thoughtful you are and if that
 

8929
02:37:41,280 --> 02:37:43,830
how thoughtful you are and if that
changes over time well but it also could

8930
02:37:43,830 --> 02:37:43,840
changes over time well but it also could
 

8931
02:37:43,840 --> 02:37:45,510
changes over time well but it also could
be this really fascinating metric

8932
02:37:45,510 --> 02:37:45,520
be this really fascinating metric
 

8933
02:37:45,520 --> 02:37:47,349
be this really fascinating metric
because it also could be

8934
02:37:47,349 --> 02:37:47,359
because it also could be
 

8935
02:37:47,359 --> 02:37:48,950
because it also could be
it's certainly a feature of a person but

8936
02:37:48,950 --> 02:37:48,960
it's certainly a feature of a person but
 

8937
02:37:48,960 --> 02:37:51,030
it's certainly a feature of a person but
it's also a function of the question

8938
02:37:51,030 --> 02:37:51,040
it's also a function of the question
 

8939
02:37:51,040 --> 02:37:53,510
it's also a function of the question
like if you normalize to the person

8940
02:37:53,510 --> 02:37:53,520
like if you normalize to the person
 

8941
02:37:53,520 --> 02:37:55,270
like if you normalize to the person
you can probably infer a bunch of stuff

8942
02:37:55,270 --> 02:37:55,280
you can probably infer a bunch of stuff
 

8943
02:37:55,280 --> 02:37:57,510
you can probably infer a bunch of stuff
about the question so it's a nice flag

8944
02:37:57,510 --> 02:37:57,520
about the question so it's a nice flag
 

8945
02:37:57,520 --> 02:37:59,590
about the question so it's a nice flag
like it's a really strong signal the

8946
02:37:59,590 --> 02:37:59,600
like it's a really strong signal the
 

8947
02:37:59,600 --> 02:38:01,270
like it's a really strong signal the
length of that silence

8948
02:38:01,270 --> 02:38:01,280
length of that silence
 

8949
02:38:01,280 --> 02:38:03,590
length of that silence
relative to the usual silence they have

8950
02:38:03,590 --> 02:38:03,600
relative to the usual silence they have
 

8951
02:38:03,600 --> 02:38:05,830
relative to the usual silence they have
so one the silence is a measure of how

8952
02:38:05,830 --> 02:38:05,840
so one the silence is a measure of how
 

8953
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:07,910
so one the silence is a measure of how
thoughtful they are and two the

8954
02:38:07,910 --> 02:38:07,920
thoughtful they are and two the
 

8955
02:38:07,920 --> 02:38:10,070
thoughtful they are and two the
particular sounds doesn't measure how

8956
02:38:10,070 --> 02:38:10,080
particular sounds doesn't measure how
 

8957
02:38:10,080 --> 02:38:11,510
particular sounds doesn't measure how
thoughtful the question was thoughtful

8958
02:38:11,510 --> 02:38:11,520
thoughtful the question was thoughtful
 

8959
02:38:11,520 --> 02:38:12,950
thoughtful the question was thoughtful
the question was it's really interesting

8960
02:38:12,950 --> 02:38:12,960
the question was it's really interesting
 

8961
02:38:12,960 --> 02:38:15,990
the question was it's really interesting
i mean yeah yeah i just analyzed elon's

8962
02:38:15,990 --> 02:38:16,000
i mean yeah yeah i just analyzed elon's
 

8963
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:17,510
i mean yeah yeah i just analyzed elon's
uh um

8964
02:38:17,510 --> 02:38:17,520
uh um
 

8965
02:38:17,520 --> 02:38:19,590
uh um
episode but i think there's like room

8966
02:38:19,590 --> 02:38:19,600
episode but i think there's like room
 

8967
02:38:19,600 --> 02:38:21,830
episode but i think there's like room
for exploration there i feel like the

8968
02:38:21,830 --> 02:38:21,840
for exploration there i feel like the
 

8969
02:38:21,840 --> 02:38:23,349
for exploration there i feel like the
average they could do for comedians

8970
02:38:23,349 --> 02:38:23,359
average they could do for comedians
 

8971
02:38:23,359 --> 02:38:24,389
average they could do for comedians
would be

8972
02:38:24,389 --> 02:38:24,399
would be
 

8973
02:38:24,399 --> 02:38:25,830
would be
like i mean the time would be so small

8974
02:38:25,830 --> 02:38:25,840
like i mean the time would be so small
 

8975
02:38:25,840 --> 02:38:27,830
like i mean the time would be so small
because you're trained to like i would

8976
02:38:27,830 --> 02:38:27,840
because you're trained to like i would
 

8977
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:29,429
because you're trained to like i would
think you're reacting to hecklers you're

8978
02:38:29,429 --> 02:38:29,439
think you're reacting to hecklers you're
 

8979

to be like so quick maybe right yeah but
 

8983

9011
02:39:02,080 --> 02:39:04,950
it's one of the ways to have people hang
in your word is to play with the pauses

9012

in your word is to play with the pauses
 

9013
02:39:04,960 --> 02:39:07,270
in your word is to play with the pauses
to play with the silences and the

to play with the silences and the
 

9015

emphasis
 

9017
02:39:08,479 --> 02:39:10,550
emphasis
and like mid-sentence there's a bunch of

9018
02:39:10,550 --> 02:39:10,560
and like mid-sentence there's a bunch of
 

9019
02:39:10,560 --> 02:39:12,150
and like mid-sentence there's a bunch of
different things that uh it'd be

9020
02:39:12,150 --> 02:39:12,160
different things that uh it'd be
 

9021
02:39:12,160 --> 02:39:13,670
different things that uh it'd be
interesting to really

9022
02:39:13,670 --> 02:39:13,680
interesting to really
 

9023
02:39:13,680 --> 02:39:15,830
interesting to really
really analyze but still soccer to me is

9024
02:39:15,830 --> 02:39:15,840
really analyze but still soccer to me is
 

9025
02:39:15,840 --> 02:39:17,510
really analyze but still soccer to me is
uh that's that that one that's

9026
02:39:17,510 --> 02:39:17,520
uh that's that that one that's
 

9027
02:39:17,520 --> 02:39:19,030
uh that's that that one that's
fascinating just i just want a

9028
02:39:19,030 --> 02:39:19,040
fascinating just i just want a
 

9029
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:21,910
fascinating just i just want a
conclusive definitive statement about

9030
02:39:21,910 --> 02:39:21,920
conclusive definitive statement about
 

9031
02:39:21,920 --> 02:39:25,510
conclusive definitive statement about
it's like there are so many

9032
02:39:25,510 --> 02:39:25,520
it's like there are so many
 

9033
02:39:25,520 --> 02:39:27,510
it's like there are so many
soccer highlights of both messi and

ronaldo
 

9037
02:39:28,720 --> 02:39:34,550
ronaldo
i just feel like the raw data is there

9038
02:39:34,550 --> 02:39:34,560

 

9039
02:39:34,560 --> 02:39:37,750

um because you don't have that with pele

9040
02:39:37,750 --> 02:39:37,760
um because you don't have that with pele
 

9041
02:39:37,760 --> 02:39:39,510
um because you don't have that with pele
just remember yeah through but here's a

9042
02:39:39,510 --> 02:39:39,520
just remember yeah through but here's a
 

9043
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:42,309
just remember yeah through but here's a
huge amount of high def data then the

9044
02:39:42,309 --> 02:39:42,319
huge amount of high def data then the
 

9045
02:39:42,319 --> 02:39:43,990
huge amount of high def data then the
the annoying the difficult thing and

9046
02:39:43,990 --> 02:39:44,000
the annoying the difficult thing and
 

9047
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,230
the annoying the difficult thing and
this is really hard for tracking and

9048
02:39:46,230 --> 02:39:46,240
this is really hard for tracking and
 

9049
02:39:46,240 --> 02:39:49,030
this is really hard for tracking and
this is actually where i kind of gave up

9050
02:39:49,030 --> 02:39:49,040
this is actually where i kind of gave up
 

9051
02:39:49,040 --> 02:39:50,790
this is actually where i kind of gave up
because i didn't really give much effort

9052
02:39:50,790 --> 02:39:50,800
because i didn't really give much effort
 

9053
02:39:50,800 --> 02:39:53,670
because i didn't really give much effort
but i gave up

9054
02:39:53,670 --> 02:39:53,680
but i gave up
 

9055
02:39:53,680 --> 02:39:56,309
but i gave up
to the the way that highlights or

9056
02:39:56,309 --> 02:39:56,319
to the the way that highlights or
 

9057
02:39:56,319 --> 02:39:58,389
to the the way that highlights or
usually football match are filmed is

9058
02:39:58,389 --> 02:39:58,399
usually football match are filmed is

they switch the camera so they'll

9060
02:40:00,550 --> 02:40:00,560
they switch the camera so they'll
 

9061
02:40:00,560 --> 02:40:01,990
they switch the camera so they'll
they'll do a different switch

9062
02:40:01,990 --> 02:40:02,000
they'll do a different switch
 

9063
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,070
they'll do a different switch
perspective so you have to

9064
02:40:04,070 --> 02:40:04,080
perspective so you have to
 

9065
02:40:04,080 --> 02:40:05,270
perspective so you have to
it's a really interesting computer

9066
02:40:05,270 --> 02:40:05,280
it's a really interesting computer
 

9067
02:40:05,280 --> 02:40:06,790
it's a really interesting computer
vision problem when the perspective is

9068
02:40:06,790 --> 02:40:06,800
vision problem when the perspective is
 

9069
02:40:06,800 --> 02:40:08,950
vision problem when the perspective is
switched you still have a lot of overlap

9070
02:40:08,950 --> 02:40:08,960
switched you still have a lot of overlap
 

9071
02:40:08,960 --> 02:40:11,349
switched you still have a lot of overlap
about the players but the perspective is

9072
02:40:11,349 --> 02:40:11,359
about the players but the perspective is
 

9073
02:40:11,359 --> 02:40:12,710
about the players but the perspective is
sufficiently different that you have to

9074
02:40:12,710 --> 02:40:12,720
sufficiently different that you have to
 

9075
02:40:12,720 --> 02:40:15,750
sufficiently different that you have to
like recompute everything so i

there there's two ways to solve this so

9078
02:40:17,590 --> 02:40:17,600
there there's two ways to solve this so
 

9079
02:40:17,600 --> 02:40:18,630
there there's two ways to solve this so
one

9080
02:40:18,630 --> 02:40:18,640
one
 

9081
02:40:18,640 --> 02:40:20,309
one
is doing it the full way where you're

9082
02:40:20,309 --> 02:40:20,319
is doing it the full way where you're
 

9083
02:40:20,319 --> 02:40:22,230
is doing it the full way where you're
constantly doing the slam problem you

9084
02:40:22,230 --> 02:40:22,240
constantly doing the slam problem you
 

9085
02:40:22,240 --> 02:40:24,070
constantly doing the slam problem you
you're doing a 3d reconstruction the

9086
02:40:24,070 --> 02:40:24,080
you're doing a 3d reconstruction the
 

9087
02:40:24,080 --> 02:40:26,070
you're doing a 3d reconstruction the
whole time and projecting into that 3d

9088
02:40:26,070 --> 02:40:26,080
whole time and projecting into that 3d
 

9089

that i wonder like some trick where you

9096
02:40:32,230 --> 02:40:32,240
that i wonder like some trick where you
 

9097
02:40:32,240 --> 02:40:33,510
that i wonder like some trick where you
can hop

9098
02:40:33,510 --> 02:40:33,520
can hop
 

9099
02:40:33,520 --> 02:40:36,230
can hop
like when the perspective shifts

9100
02:40:36,230 --> 02:40:36,240
like when the perspective shifts
 

9101
02:40:36,240 --> 02:40:39,670

02:40:39,670 --> 02:40:39,680
do a high probability tracking hops from
 

9103
02:40:39,680 --> 02:40:43,510
do a high probability tracking hops from
one object to another but i i thought

9104
02:40:43,510 --> 02:40:43,520
one object to another but i i thought
 

9105
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:46,150
one object to another but i i thought
especially in exciting moments when when

uh

9108
02:40:46,870 --> 02:40:46,880
uh
 

9109
02:40:46,880 --> 02:40:49,349
uh
when you're passing players like you're

9110
02:40:49,349 --> 02:40:49,359
when you're passing players like you're
 

9111
02:40:49,359 --> 02:40:51,830
when you're passing players like you're
doing a single ball dribble

9112
02:40:51,830 --> 02:40:51,840
doing a single ball dribble
 

9113
02:40:51,840 --> 02:40:53,349
doing a single ball dribble
across players and you switch

9114
02:40:53,349 --> 02:40:53,359
across players and you switch
 

9115
02:40:53,359 --> 02:40:54,870
across players and you switch
perspective which is when they often do

9116
02:40:54,870 --> 02:40:54,880
perspective which is when they often do
 

9117
02:40:54,880 --> 02:40:56,710
perspective which is when they often do
when you're making a run on goal if you

9118
02:40:56,710 --> 02:40:56,720
when you're making a run on goal if you
 

9119
02:40:56,720 --> 02:40:58,309
when you're making a run on goal if you
switch your perspective

9120
02:40:58,309 --> 02:40:58,319
switch your perspective
 

9121
02:40:58,319 --> 02:40:59,990
switch your perspective
it's it feels like that's going to be

9122
02:40:59,990 --> 02:41:00,000
it's it feels like that's going to be
 

9123
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,550
it's it feels like that's going to be
really tricky to get right

9124
02:41:02,550 --> 02:41:02,560
really tricky to get right
 

9125
02:41:02,560 --> 02:41:04,550
really tricky to get right
automatically but in that case i feel

9126
02:41:04,550 --> 02:41:04,560
automatically but in that case i feel
 

9127
02:41:04,560 --> 02:41:06,630
automatically but in that case i feel
like if somebody released that data set

9128
02:41:06,630 --> 02:41:06,640
like if somebody released that data set
 

9129
02:41:06,640 --> 02:41:09,750
like if somebody released that data set
or it's like you just have all like

9130
02:41:09,750 --> 02:41:09,760
or it's like you just have all like
 

9131
02:41:09,760 --> 02:41:11,990
or it's like you just have all like
these this data set a massive data set

02:41:11,990 --> 02:41:12,000
these this data set a massive data set
 

9133
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,070
these this data set a massive data set
of all these games from from say ronaldo

9134
02:41:14,070 --> 02:41:14,080
of all these games from from say ronaldo
 

9135
02:41:14,080 --> 02:41:15,990

and messi like and just you just add

9136
02:41:15,990 --> 02:41:16,000
and messi like and just you just add
 

9137
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,630
and messi like and just you just add
that in like whatever csv format and

9138
02:41:18,630 --> 02:41:18,640
that in like whatever csv format and
 

9139
02:41:18,640 --> 02:41:20,630

like that i feel like people would just

9142
02:41:23,590 --> 02:41:23,600
like that i feel like people would just
 

9143
02:41:23,600 --> 02:41:25,110
like that i feel like people would just
there there would be so many cool things

9144
02:41:25,110 --> 02:41:25,120
there there would be so many cool things
 

9145
02:41:25,120 --> 02:41:26,389
there there would be so many cool things
that you could do with it and you just

9146
02:41:26,389 --> 02:41:26,399
that you could do with it and you just
 

9147
02:41:26,399 --> 02:41:28,550
that you could do with it and you just
set it free and then like the world

9148
02:41:28,550 --> 02:41:28,560
set it free and then like the world
 

9149
02:41:28,560 --> 02:41:30,469
set it free and then like the world
would like do its thing and then like

9150
02:41:30,469 --> 02:41:30,479
would like do its thing and then like
 

9151
02:41:30,479 --> 02:41:32,230
would like do its thing and then like
interesting things would come out of it

9152
02:41:32,230 --> 02:41:32,240
interesting things would come out of it
 

9153
02:41:32,240 --> 02:41:33,190
interesting things would come out of it
by the way

9154
02:41:33,190 --> 02:41:33,200
by the way
 

9155
02:41:33,200 --> 02:41:35,349
by the way
i have this data set so

i have this data set so
 

9157
02:41:35,359 --> 02:41:37,110
i have this data set so
the two things that i've did of this

9170
02:41:49,110 --> 02:41:49,120
it was joe rogan and a few other
 

9171
02:41:49,120 --> 02:41:50,950
it was joe rogan and a few other
podcasts that i did so those are the two

podcasts that i did so those are the two
 

9173
02:41:50,960 --> 02:41:52,469

did you analyze any of your podcasts

9176
02:41:56,150 --> 02:41:56,160
did you analyze any of your podcasts
 

9177
02:41:56,160 --> 02:41:59,030
did you analyze any of your podcasts
no i i think i really started doing this

9178
02:41:59,030 --> 02:41:59,040
no i i think i really started doing this
 

9179
02:41:59,040 --> 02:42:01,030
no i i think i really started doing this
podcast after

9180
02:42:01,030 --> 02:42:01,040
podcast after
 

9181
02:42:01,040 --> 02:42:03,830
podcast after
after doing that work and it's difficult

9182
02:42:03,830 --> 02:42:03,840
after doing that work and it's difficult
 

9183
02:42:03,840 --> 02:42:06,550
after doing that work and it's difficult
to

9185
02:42:06,560 --> 02:42:09,510

maybe i'd be afraid of what i find

9186
02:42:09,510 --> 02:42:09,520
maybe i'd be afraid of what i find
 

9187

and video like editing it

9190
02:42:14,389 --> 02:42:14,399
and video like editing it
 

9191
02:42:14,399 --> 02:42:15,830
and video like editing it
but perhaps that's the honest thing to

9192
02:42:15,830 --> 02:42:15,840
but perhaps that's the honest thing to
 

9193
02:42:15,840 --> 02:42:18,309
but perhaps that's the honest thing to
do because uh one useful thing

9194
02:42:18,309 --> 02:42:18,319
do because uh one useful thing

close your eyes like
talking about details there's it's like

talking about details there's it's like
 

9213
02:42:38,880 --> 02:42:41,110
talking about details there's it's like
for example i just closed my eyes

for example i just closed my eyes
 

9215
02:42:41,120 --> 02:42:42,950
for example i just closed my eyes
is that a blink or no

9216
02:42:42,950 --> 02:42:42,960
is that a blink or no
 

9217
02:42:42,960 --> 02:42:44,150
is that a blink or no
like

9218

like
 

9219
02:42:44,160 --> 02:42:45,910
like
figuring that out in terms of timing in

9223
02:42:47,840 --> 02:42:49,990
terms of the blink dynamics
is tricky it's very doable i

9224
02:42:49,990 --> 02:42:50,000
is tricky it's very doable i
 

9225
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,550
is tricky it's very doable i
i think there's universal laws

9226
02:42:52,550 --> 02:42:52,560
i think there's universal laws
 

9227
02:42:52,560 --> 02:42:54,309
i think there's universal laws
about what is a blink and what is a

9228
02:42:54,309 --> 02:42:54,319
about what is a blink and what is a
 

9229
02:42:54,319 --> 02:42:56,550
about what is a blink and what is a
closed eye and all those things plus

9230
02:42:56,550 --> 02:42:56,560
closed eye and all those things plus
 

9231
02:42:56,560 --> 02:42:59,670
closed eye and all those things plus
makeup and eyelashes i actually um

9232
02:42:59,670 --> 02:42:59,680
makeup and eyelashes i actually um
 

9233
02:42:59,680 --> 02:43:02,230
makeup and eyelashes i actually um
have annoyingly long eyelashes so i

9234
02:43:02,230 --> 02:43:02,240
have annoyingly long eyelashes so i
 

9235
02:43:02,240 --> 02:43:03,590
have annoyingly long eyelashes so i
remember when i was doing a lot of this

9236
02:43:03,590 --> 02:43:03,600
remember when i was doing a lot of this
 

9237
02:43:03,600 --> 02:43:07,670
remember when i was doing a lot of this
work i i would cut off my eyelashes

9238
02:43:07,670 --> 02:43:07,680
work i i would cut off my eyelashes
 

9239
02:43:07,680 --> 02:43:09,750
work i i would cut off my eyelashes
when like especially it was funny like

9240
02:43:09,750 --> 02:43:09,760
when like especially it was funny like
 

9241
02:43:09,760 --> 02:43:11,030
when like especially it was funny like
female colleagues were like what the

9242
02:43:11,030 --> 02:43:11,040
female colleagues were like what the
 

9243
02:43:11,040 --> 02:43:13,110
female colleagues were like what the
[\h__\h] are you doing like those no keep

9244
02:43:13,110 --> 02:43:13,120
[\h__\h] are you doing like those no keep
 

9245
02:43:13,120 --> 02:43:15,429
[\h__\h] are you doing like those no keep
the eyelashes but because it got in the

9246
02:43:15,429 --> 02:43:15,439
the eyelashes but because it got in the
 

9247
02:43:15,439 --> 02:43:17,349
the eyelashes but because it got in the
way made the computer vision a lot more

9248
02:43:17,349 --> 02:43:17,359
way made the computer vision a lot more
 

9249
02:43:17,359 --> 02:43:19,110
way made the computer vision a lot more
difficult but

9250
02:43:19,110 --> 02:43:19,120
difficult but
 

9251
02:43:19,120 --> 02:43:20,790
difficult but
super interesting topics yeah but

9252
02:43:20,790 --> 02:43:20,800
super interesting topics yeah but
 

9253
02:43:20,800 --> 02:43:22,389
super interesting topics yeah but
speaking about the

9254
02:43:22,389 --> 02:43:22,399
speaking about the
 

9255
02:43:22,399 --> 02:43:24,950
speaking about the
one uh still on the topic of the data

9256
02:43:24,950 --> 02:43:24,960
one uh still on the topic of the data
 

9257
02:43:24,960 --> 02:43:27,830
one uh still on the topic of the data
sets for sports there's one um one paper

9258
02:43:27,830 --> 02:43:27,840
sets for sports there's one um one paper
 

9259
02:43:27,840 --> 02:43:29,110
sets for sports there's one um one paper
that and i actually annotated it on

9260
02:43:29,110 --> 02:43:29,120
that and i actually annotated it on
 

9261
02:43:29,120 --> 02:43:31,190
that and i actually annotated it on
fermat and uh

9262
02:43:31,190 --> 02:43:31,200
fermat and uh
 

9263
02:43:31,200 --> 02:43:35,190
fermat and uh
it's it was published in uh 90s 90s i

9264
02:43:35,190 --> 02:43:35,200
it's it was published in uh 90s 90s i
 

9265
02:43:35,200 --> 02:43:37,990
it's it was published in uh 90s 90s i
believe 90s or 80s i forget but they're

9266
02:43:37,990 --> 02:43:38,000
believe 90s or 80s i forget but they're
 

9267
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,230
believe 90s or 80s i forget but they're
you the researcher was effectively

9268
02:43:40,230 --> 02:43:40,240
you the researcher was effectively
 

9269
02:43:40,240 --> 02:43:41,590
you the researcher was effectively
looking at

9270
02:43:41,590 --> 02:43:41,600
looking at
 

9271
02:43:41,600 --> 02:43:45,030
looking at
the hot and phenomena in basketball

9272
02:43:45,030 --> 02:43:45,040
the hot and phenomena in basketball
 

9273
02:43:45,040 --> 02:43:47,269
the hot and phenomena in basketball
right so whether like the fact that you

9274
02:43:47,269 --> 02:43:47,279
right so whether like the fact that you
 

9275
02:43:47,279 --> 02:43:50,870
right so whether like the fact that you
just made a field goal um if you know if

9276
02:43:50,870 --> 02:43:50,880
just made a field goal um if you know if
 

9277
02:43:50,880 --> 02:43:52,790
just made a field goal um if you know if
on your next attempt if you're more

9278
02:43:52,790 --> 02:43:52,800
on your next attempt if you're more
 

9279
02:43:52,800 --> 02:43:55,030
on your next attempt if you're more
likely to make it or not

9280
02:43:55,030 --> 02:43:55,040
likely to make it or not
 

9281
02:43:55,040 --> 02:43:56,630
likely to make it or not
um

9282
02:43:56,630 --> 02:43:56,640
um
 

9283
02:43:56,640 --> 02:43:58,230
um
and it was super interesting because i

9284
02:43:58,230 --> 02:43:58,240
and it was super interesting because i
 

9285
02:43:58,240 --> 02:44:00,389
and it was super interesting because i
mean he pulled like i think 100

9286
02:44:00,389 --> 02:44:00,399
mean he pulled like i think 100
 

9287
02:44:00,399 --> 02:44:01,750
mean he pulled like i think 100
undergrads and

9288
02:44:01,750 --> 02:44:01,760
undergrads and
 

9289
02:44:01,760 --> 02:44:03,429
undergrads and
i think from stanford and cornell and

9290
02:44:03,429 --> 02:44:03,439
i think from stanford and cornell and
 

9291
02:44:03,439 --> 02:44:05,190
i think from stanford and cornell and
asking people like do you

9292
02:44:05,190 --> 02:44:05,200
asking people like do you
 

9293
02:44:05,200 --> 02:44:06,870
asking people like do you
you think that's that you have a higher

9294
02:44:06,870 --> 02:44:06,880
you think that's that you have a higher
 

9295
02:44:06,880 --> 02:44:09,190
you think that's that you have a higher
likelihood of making your free throw if

9296
02:44:09,190 --> 02:44:09,200
likelihood of making your free throw if
 

9297
02:44:09,200 --> 02:44:11,030
likelihood of making your free throw if
you just just made one and i think it's

9298
02:44:11,030 --> 02:44:11,040
you just just made one and i think it's
 

9299
02:44:11,040 --> 02:44:13,750
you just just made one and i think it's
like 68 68

9300
02:44:13,750 --> 02:44:13,760
like 68 68
 

9301
02:44:13,760 --> 02:44:16,070
like 68 68
said yes they believe that and and then

9302
02:44:16,070 --> 02:44:16,080
said yes they believe that and and then
 

9303
02:44:16,080 --> 02:44:17,510
said yes they believe that and and then
he looked

9304
02:44:17,510 --> 02:44:17,520
he looked
 

9305
02:44:17,520 --> 02:44:19,269
he looked
at the data

9306
02:44:19,269 --> 02:44:19,279
at the data
 

9307
02:44:19,279 --> 02:44:21,269
at the data
and this was back in as i said like a

9308
02:44:21,269 --> 02:44:21,279
and this was back in as i said like a
 

9309
02:44:21,279 --> 02:44:23,030
and this was back in as i said like a
few decades ago and so i think he had a

9310
02:44:23,030 --> 02:44:23,040
few decades ago and so i think he had a
 

9311
02:44:23,040 --> 02:44:24,550
few decades ago and so i think he had a
data set of about

9312
02:44:24,550 --> 02:44:24,560
data set of about
 

9313
02:44:24,560 --> 02:44:26,790
data set of about
he looked at it specifically for free

9314
02:44:26,790 --> 02:44:26,800
he looked at it specifically for free
 

9315
02:44:26,800 --> 02:44:29,030
he looked at it specifically for free
throws and he had a data set of about 5

9316
02:44:29,030 --> 02:44:29,040
throws and he had a data set of about 5
 

9317
02:44:29,040 --> 02:44:30,790
throws and he had a data set of about 5
000 free throws

9318
02:44:30,790 --> 02:44:30,800
000 free throws
 

9319
02:44:30,800 --> 02:44:32,389
000 free throws
and

9320
02:44:32,389 --> 02:44:32,399
and
 

9321
02:44:32,399 --> 02:44:35,510
and
and effectively what he found was that

9322
02:44:35,510 --> 02:44:35,520
and effectively what he found was that
 

9323
02:44:35,520 --> 02:44:37,990
and effectively what he found was that
specifically in the case of free throws

9324
02:44:37,990 --> 02:44:38,000
specifically in the case of free throws
 

9325
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,150
specifically in the case of free throws
he didn't for the aggregate data he

9326
02:44:40,150 --> 02:44:40,160
he didn't for the aggregate data he
 

9327
02:44:40,160 --> 02:44:42,950
he didn't for the aggregate data he
didn't find um that

9328
02:44:42,950 --> 02:44:42,960
didn't find um that
 

9329
02:44:42,960 --> 02:44:44,790
didn't find um that
he couldn't really spot that correlation

9330
02:44:44,790 --> 02:44:44,800
he couldn't really spot that correlation
 

9331
02:44:44,800 --> 02:44:46,790
he couldn't really spot that correlation
that hot end correlation so if you made

9332
02:44:46,790 --> 02:44:46,800
that hot end correlation so if you made
 

9333
02:44:46,800 --> 02:44:49,670
that hot end correlation so if you made
the first one you weren't more likely to

9334
02:44:49,670 --> 02:44:49,680
the first one you weren't more likely to
 

9335
02:44:49,680 --> 02:44:52,309
the first one you weren't more likely to
to make the second one what he did find

9336
02:44:52,309 --> 02:44:52,319
to make the second one what he did find
 

9337
02:44:52,319 --> 02:44:53,910
to make the second one what he did find
was that they were just better at the

9338
02:44:53,910 --> 02:44:53,920
was that they were just better at the
 

9339
02:44:53,920 --> 02:44:55,910
was that they were just better at the
second one because you just got like

9340
02:44:55,910 --> 02:44:55,920
second one because you just got like
 

9341
02:44:55,920 --> 02:44:57,910
second one because you just got like
maybe a tiny practice and you just you

9342
02:44:57,910 --> 02:44:57,920
maybe a tiny practice and you just you
 

9343
02:44:57,920 --> 02:45:00,150
maybe a tiny practice and you just you
attempted once and then and then you're

9344
02:45:00,150 --> 02:45:00,160
attempted once and then and then you're
 

9345
02:45:00,160 --> 02:45:01,670
attempted once and then and then you're
going to be better at the next one and

9346
02:45:01,670 --> 02:45:01,680
going to be better at the next one and
 

9347
02:45:01,680 --> 02:45:04,070
going to be better at the next one and
then i i then i went and there's a data

9348
02:45:04,070 --> 02:45:04,080
then i i then i went and there's a data
 

9349
02:45:04,080 --> 02:45:07,269
then i i then i went and there's a data
set on kaggle that has like 600 000 free

9350
02:45:07,269 --> 02:45:07,279
set on kaggle that has like 600 000 free
 

9351
02:45:07,279 --> 02:45:10,309
set on kaggle that has like 600 000 free
throws and i reran the the same

9352
02:45:10,309 --> 02:45:10,319
throws and i reran the the same
 

9353
02:45:10,319 --> 02:45:12,230
throws and i reran the the same
computations and and

9354
02:45:12,230 --> 02:45:12,240
computations and and
 

9355
02:45:12,240 --> 02:45:13,990
computations and and
confirmed like you can see a very clear

9356
02:45:13,990 --> 02:45:14,000
confirmed like you can see a very clear
 

9357
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,230
confirmed like you can see a very clear
pattern that they're just better at

9358
02:45:16,230 --> 02:45:16,240
pattern that they're just better at
 

9359
02:45:16,240 --> 02:45:18,710
pattern that they're just better at
their second free throw um that's

9360
02:45:18,710 --> 02:45:18,720
their second free throw um that's
 

9361
02:45:18,720 --> 02:45:20,150
their second free throw um that's
interesting because i think there's

9362
02:45:20,150 --> 02:45:20,160
interesting because i think there's
 

9363
02:45:20,160 --> 02:45:21,110
interesting because i think there's
similar

9364
02:45:21,110 --> 02:45:21,120
similar
 

9365
02:45:21,120 --> 02:45:22,950
similar
that kind of analysis is so awesome

9366
02:45:22,950 --> 02:45:22,960
that kind of analysis is so awesome
 

9367
02:45:22,960 --> 02:45:24,469
that kind of analysis is so awesome
because i think with tennis they have

9368
02:45:24,469 --> 02:45:24,479
because i think with tennis they have
 

9369
02:45:24,479 --> 02:45:26,790
because i think with tennis they have
like uh like a fault like when you serve

9370
02:45:26,790 --> 02:45:26,800
like uh like a fault like when you serve
 

9371
02:45:26,800 --> 02:45:29,190
like uh like a fault like when you serve
they have analysis of like are you most

9372
02:45:29,190 --> 02:45:29,200
they have analysis of like are you most
 

9373
02:45:29,200 --> 02:45:30,950
they have analysis of like are you most
likely to miss the second serve if you

9374
02:45:30,950 --> 02:45:30,960
likely to miss the second serve if you
 

9375
02:45:30,960 --> 02:45:32,870
likely to miss the second serve if you
missed first obviously

9376
02:45:32,870 --> 02:45:32,880
missed first obviously
 

9377
02:45:32,880 --> 02:45:35,190
missed first obviously
um yeah i think that's the case so that

9378
02:45:35,190 --> 02:45:35,200
um yeah i think that's the case so that
 

9379
02:45:35,200 --> 02:45:37,110
um yeah i think that's the case so that
integrates

9380
02:45:37,110 --> 02:45:37,120
integrates
 

9381
02:45:37,120 --> 02:45:39,030
integrates
that's so cool when psychology is

9382
02:45:39,030 --> 02:45:39,040
that's so cool when psychology is
 

9383
02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:40,710
that's so cool when psychology is
converted into metrics in that way and

9384
02:45:40,710 --> 02:45:40,720
converted into metrics in that way and
 

9385
02:45:40,720 --> 02:45:43,429
converted into metrics in that way and
in sports it's especially cool because

9386
02:45:43,429 --> 02:45:43,439

curiosity and that path
 

9549
02:48:31,680 --> 02:48:34,389
curiosity and that path
to fulfilling that uh your curiosity

9550
02:48:34,389 --> 02:48:34,399
to fulfilling that uh your curiosity
 

9551
02:48:34,399 --> 02:48:36,710
to fulfilling that uh your curiosity
yeah the the the start small and let the

9552
02:48:36,710 --> 02:48:36,720
yeah the the the start small and let the
 

9553
02:48:36,720 --> 02:48:38,630
yeah the the the start small and let the
fire build is kind of interesting way to

9554
02:48:38,630 --> 02:48:38,640
fire build is kind of interesting way to
 

9555
02:48:38,640 --> 02:48:40,150
fire build is kind of interesting way to
think about it and you never know where

9556
02:48:40,150 --> 02:48:40,160
think about it and you never know where
 

9557
02:48:40,160 --> 02:48:42,309
think about it and you never know where
you're gonna end up it's it's

9558
02:48:42,309 --> 02:48:42,319
you're gonna end up it's it's
 

9559
02:48:42,319 --> 02:48:44,469
you're gonna end up it's it's
like for instance from us it's just a

9560
02:48:44,469 --> 02:48:44,479
like for instance from us it's just a
 

9561
02:48:44,479 --> 02:48:46,389
like for instance from us it's just a
really good example we started like just

9562
02:48:46,389 --> 02:48:46,399
really good example we started like just
 

9563
02:48:46,399 --> 02:48:49,110
really good example we started like just
by doing this as an internal like thing

9564
02:48:49,110 --> 02:48:49,120
by doing this as an internal like thing
 

9565
02:48:49,120 --> 02:48:51,269
by doing this as an internal like thing
that we did with in the company and then

9566
02:48:51,269 --> 02:48:51,279
that we did with in the company and then
 

9567
02:48:51,279 --> 02:48:52,630
that we did with in the company and then
we started putting out there and now a

9568
02:48:52,630 --> 02:48:52,640
we started putting out there and now a
 

9569
02:48:52,640 --> 02:48:54,469
we started putting out there and now a
lot of people follow it and know about

9570
02:48:54,469 --> 02:48:54,479
lot of people follow it and know about
 

9571
02:48:54,479 --> 02:48:56,950
lot of people follow it and know about
it and so um and you still don't know

9572
02:48:56,950 --> 02:48:56,960
it and so um and you still don't know
 

9573
02:48:56,960 --> 02:48:58,630
it and so um and you still don't know
where females libra is going to end up

9574
02:48:58,630 --> 02:48:58,640
where females libra is going to end up
 

9575
02:48:58,640 --> 02:49:02,230
where females libra is going to end up
actually true exactly so um yeah i think

9576
02:49:02,230 --> 02:49:02,240
actually true exactly so um yeah i think
 

9577
02:49:02,240 --> 02:49:03,429
actually true exactly so um yeah i think
that would be my

9578
02:49:03,429 --> 02:49:03,439
that would be my
 

9579
02:49:03,439 --> 02:49:05,110
that would be my
piece of advice with very limited

9580
02:49:05,110 --> 02:49:05,120
piece of advice with very limited
 

9581
02:49:05,120 --> 02:49:07,750
piece of advice with very limited
experience of course but yeah yeah i

9582
02:49:07,750 --> 02:49:07,760
experience of course but yeah yeah i
 

9583
02:49:07,760 --> 02:49:09,990
experience of course but yeah yeah i
agree i agree

9584
02:49:09,990 --> 02:49:10,000
agree i agree
 

9585
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,150
agree i agree
uh i mean is there something in from

9586
02:49:12,150 --> 02:49:12,160
uh i mean is there something in from
 

9587
02:49:12,160 --> 02:49:13,269
uh i mean is there something in from
particular

9588
02:49:13,269 --> 02:49:13,279
particular

uh do do you regret not doing physics do

9594
02:49:19,349 --> 02:49:19,359
uh do do you regret not doing physics do
 

9595
02:49:19,359 --> 02:49:21,269
uh do do you regret not doing physics do
you regret not doing computer science

9596
02:49:21,269 --> 02:49:21,279
you regret not doing computer science
 

9597
02:49:21,279 --> 02:49:23,110
you regret not doing computer science
which one is the the wiser the better

9598
02:49:23,110 --> 02:49:23,120
which one is the the wiser the better
 

9599
02:49:23,120 --> 02:49:27,110
which one is the the wiser the better
human being this is messy versus ronaldo

9600
02:49:27,110 --> 02:49:27,120
human being this is messy versus ronaldo
 

9601
02:49:27,120 --> 02:49:29,030
human being this is messy versus ronaldo
those are very

9602
02:49:29,030 --> 02:49:29,040
those are very
 

9603
02:49:29,040 --> 02:49:30,630
those are very
i i don't know if you would agree but

9604
02:49:30,630 --> 02:49:30,640
i i don't know if you would agree but
 

9605
02:49:30,640 --> 02:49:33,110
i i don't know if you would agree but
they're kind of different disciplines

9606
02:49:33,110 --> 02:49:33,120
they're kind of different disciplines
 

9607
02:49:33,120 --> 02:49:34,550
they're kind of different disciplines
true yeah

9608
02:49:34,550 --> 02:49:34,560
true yeah
 

9609
02:49:34,560 --> 02:49:35,910
true yeah
very much so

9610
02:49:35,910 --> 02:49:35,920
very much so
 

9611
02:49:35,920 --> 02:49:38,950
very much so
um i actually actually uh

9612
02:49:38,950 --> 02:49:38,960
um i actually actually uh
 

9613
02:49:38,960 --> 02:49:41,269
um i actually actually uh
i was i i had that question in my mind i

9614
02:49:41,269 --> 02:49:41,279
i was i i had that question in my mind i
 

9615
02:49:41,279 --> 02:49:43,750
i was i i had that question in my mind i
i took physics classes uh as an

9616
02:49:43,750 --> 02:49:43,760
i took physics classes uh as an
 

9617
02:49:43,760 --> 02:49:45,910
i took physics classes uh as an
undergrad uh or like

9618
02:49:45,910 --> 02:49:45,920
undergrad uh or like
 

9619
02:49:45,920 --> 02:49:47,830
undergrad uh or like
besides what i had to take

9620
02:49:47,830 --> 02:49:47,840
besides what i had to take
 

9621
02:49:47,840 --> 02:49:49,269
besides what i had to take
and um

9622
02:49:49,269 --> 02:49:49,279
and um
 

9623
02:49:49,279 --> 02:49:50,309
and um
it's definitely something that i

9624
02:49:50,309 --> 02:49:50,319
it's definitely something that i
 

9625
02:49:50,319 --> 02:49:52,070
it's definitely something that i
considered at some point

9626
02:49:52,070 --> 02:49:52,080
considered at some point
 

9627
02:49:52,080 --> 02:49:53,510
considered at some point
um

9628
02:49:53,510 --> 02:49:53,520
um
 

9629
02:49:53,520 --> 02:49:55,030
um
and

9630
02:49:55,030 --> 02:49:55,040
and
 

9631
02:49:55,040 --> 02:49:57,030
and
and that that i

9632
02:49:57,030 --> 02:49:57,040
and that that i
 

9633
02:49:57,040 --> 02:50:00,550
and that that i
i i do feel like later in life that

9634
02:50:00,550 --> 02:50:00,560
i i do feel like later in life that
 

9635
02:50:00,560 --> 02:50:02,309
i i do feel like later in life that
might be something that

9636
02:50:02,309 --> 02:50:02,319
might be something that
 

9637
02:50:02,319 --> 02:50:04,230
might be something that
i'm not sure if regret is

9638
02:50:04,230 --> 02:50:04,240
i'm not sure if regret is
 

9639
02:50:04,240 --> 02:50:06,790
i'm not sure if regret is
is the right word but it's it's kind of

9640
02:50:06,790 --> 02:50:06,800
is the right word but it's it's kind of
 

9641
02:50:06,800 --> 02:50:08,309
is the right word but it's it's kind of
something that i can imagine in an

9642
02:50:08,309 --> 02:50:08,319
something that i can imagine in an
 

9643
02:50:08,319 --> 02:50:09,990
something that i can imagine in an
alternative universe what would have

9644
02:50:09,990 --> 02:50:10,000
alternative universe what would have
 

9645
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:13,429
alternative universe what would have
happened if i if i've gone into physics

9646
02:50:13,429 --> 02:50:13,439
happened if i if i've gone into physics
 

9647
02:50:13,439 --> 02:50:15,750
happened if i if i've gone into physics
um

9648
02:50:15,750 --> 02:50:15,760
um
 

9649
02:50:15,760 --> 02:50:17,990
um
i try to think that like well depends on

9650
02:50:17,990 --> 02:50:18,000
i try to think that like well depends on
 

9651
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:19,349
i try to think that like well depends on
what your

9652
02:50:19,349 --> 02:50:19,359
what your
 

9653
02:50:19,359 --> 02:50:21,510
what your
path ends up being but that it's it's

9654
02:50:21,510 --> 02:50:21,520
path ends up being but that it's it's
 

9655
02:50:21,520 --> 02:50:22,550
path ends up being but that it's it's
not

9656
02:50:22,550 --> 02:50:22,560
not
 

9657
02:50:22,560 --> 02:50:24,630
not
super important right like exactly what

9658
02:50:24,630 --> 02:50:24,640
super important right like exactly what
 

9659
02:50:24,640 --> 02:50:26,150
super important right like exactly what
you decide to

9660
02:50:26,150 --> 02:50:26,160
you decide to
 

9661
02:50:26,160 --> 02:50:28,870
you decide to
major on like i think there's there's

9662
02:50:28,870 --> 02:50:28,880
major on like i think there's there's
 

9663
02:50:28,880 --> 02:50:29,830
major on like i think there's there's
um

9664
02:50:29,830 --> 02:50:29,840
um
 

9665
02:50:29,840 --> 02:50:32,070
um
i think tim urban like the blogger had a

9666
02:50:32,070 --> 02:50:32,080
i think tim urban like the blogger had a
 

9667
02:50:32,080 --> 02:50:33,990
i think tim urban like the blogger had a
good visualization of this where it's

9668
02:50:33,990 --> 02:50:34,000
good visualization of this where it's
 

9669
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,469
good visualization of this where it's
like you know like he

9670
02:50:36,469 --> 02:50:36,479
like you know like he
 

9671
02:50:36,479 --> 02:50:37,750
like you know like he
he has a picture where you have all

9672
02:50:37,750 --> 02:50:37,760
he has a picture where you have all
 

9673
02:50:37,760 --> 02:50:39,510
he has a picture where you have all
sorts of paths that he could pursue in

9674
02:50:39,510 --> 02:50:39,520
sorts of paths that he could pursue in
 

9675
02:50:39,520 --> 02:50:41,030
sorts of paths that he could pursue in
your life and then maybe you're in the

9676
02:50:41,030 --> 02:50:41,040
your life and then maybe you're in the
 

9677
02:50:41,040 --> 02:50:42,870
your life and then maybe you're in the
middle of it and so there's maybe some

9678
02:50:42,870 --> 02:50:42,880
middle of it and so there's maybe some
 

9679
02:50:42,880 --> 02:50:44,630
middle of it and so there's maybe some
paths that are not accessible to you but

9680
02:50:44,630 --> 02:50:44,640
paths that are not accessible to you but
 

9681
02:50:44,640 --> 02:50:46,469
paths that are not accessible to you but
like the tree that is still in front of

9682
02:50:46,469 --> 02:50:46,479
like the tree that is still in front of
 

9683
02:50:46,479 --> 02:50:47,190
like the tree that is still in front of
you

9684
02:50:47,190 --> 02:50:47,200
you
 

9685
02:50:47,200 --> 02:50:50,230
you
gives you a lot of optionality and so um

9686
02:50:50,230 --> 02:50:50,240
gives you a lot of optionality and so um
 

9687
02:50:50,240 --> 02:50:51,590
gives you a lot of optionality and so um
there's two lessons to learn from that

9688
02:50:51,590 --> 02:50:51,600
there's two lessons to learn from that
 

9689
02:50:51,600 --> 02:50:53,190
there's two lessons to learn from that
like we have a huge number of options

9690
02:50:53,190 --> 02:50:53,200
like we have a huge number of options
 

9691
02:50:53,200 --> 02:50:53,990
like we have a huge number of options
now

9692
02:50:53,990 --> 02:50:54,000
now
 

9693
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,710
now
and probably you're just one

9694
02:50:56,710 --> 02:50:56,720
and probably you're just one
 

9695
02:50:56,720 --> 02:50:59,670
and probably you're just one
to reflect

9696
02:50:59,670 --> 02:50:59,680

 

9697
02:50:59,680 --> 02:51:02,230

like to try to uh derive wisdom from the

9698
02:51:02,230 --> 02:51:02,240
like to try to uh derive wisdom from the
 

9699
02:51:02,240 --> 02:51:04,389
like to try to uh derive wisdom from the
one little path you've taken so far may

9700
02:51:04,389 --> 02:51:04,399
one little path you've taken so far may
 

9701
02:51:04,399 --> 02:51:05,830
one little path you've taken so far may
be flawed because there's all these

9702
02:51:05,830 --> 02:51:05,840
be flawed because there's all these
 

9703
02:51:05,840 --> 02:51:07,990
be flawed because there's all these
other paths you could have taken yeah so

9704
02:51:07,990 --> 02:51:08,000
other paths you could have taken yeah so
 

9705
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:09,110
other paths you could have taken yeah so
it's like

9706
02:51:09,110 --> 02:51:09,120
it's like
 

9707
02:51:09,120 --> 02:51:10,950
it's like
uh so one it's inspiring that you can

9708
02:51:10,950 --> 02:51:10,960
uh so one it's inspiring that you can
 

9709
02:51:10,960 --> 02:51:13,110
uh so one it's inspiring that you can
take any path now and two

9710
02:51:13,110 --> 02:51:13,120
take any path now and two
 

9711
02:51:13,120 --> 02:51:14,870
take any path now and two
it's like you you the path you've taken

9712
02:51:14,870 --> 02:51:14,880
it's like you you the path you've taken
 

9713
02:51:14,880 --> 02:51:18,070
it's like you you the path you've taken
so far is just one of many possible ones

9714
02:51:18,070 --> 02:51:18,080
so far is just one of many possible ones
 

9715
02:51:18,080 --> 02:51:20,389
so far is just one of many possible ones
but it does seem that like

9716
02:51:20,389 --> 02:51:20,399
but it does seem that like
 

9717
02:51:20,399 --> 02:51:22,469
but it does seem that like
physics and computer science both open a

9718
02:51:22,469 --> 02:51:22,479
physics and computer science both open a
 

9719
02:51:22,479 --> 02:51:25,510
physics and computer science both open a
lot of doors in a lot of different doors

9720
02:51:25,510 --> 02:51:25,520
lot of doors in a lot of different doors
 

9721
02:51:25,520 --> 02:51:28,389
lot of doors in a lot of different doors
it's very interesting it is i i like in

9722
02:51:28,389 --> 02:51:28,399
it's very interesting it is i i like in
 

9723
02:51:28,399 --> 02:51:30,550
it's very interesting it is i i like in
this case like and especially in in our

9724
02:51:30,550 --> 02:51:30,560
this case like and especially in in our
 

9725
02:51:30,560 --> 02:51:32,070
this case like and especially in in our
case because i could see the difference

9726
02:51:32,070 --> 02:51:32,080
case because i could see the difference
 

9727
02:51:32,080 --> 02:51:33,429
case because i could see the difference
i studied i

9728
02:51:33,429 --> 02:51:33,439
i studied i
 

9729
02:51:33,439 --> 02:51:35,990
i studied i
i did i went to college in europe and uh

9730
02:51:35,990 --> 02:51:36,000
i did i went to college in europe and uh
 

9731
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:37,750
i did i went to college in europe and uh
went to college here in the us so i

9732
02:51:37,750 --> 02:51:37,760
went to college here in the us so i
 

9733
02:51:37,760 --> 02:51:39,429
went to college here in the us so i
could see the differences like in the

9734
02:51:39,429 --> 02:51:39,439
could see the differences like in the
 

9735
02:51:39,439 --> 02:51:41,030
could see the differences like in the
european system is

9736
02:51:41,030 --> 02:51:41,040
european system is
 

9737
02:51:41,040 --> 02:51:43,429
european system is
um more rigid in the sense that when you

9738
02:51:43,429 --> 02:51:43,439
um more rigid in the sense that when you
 

9739
02:51:43,439 --> 02:51:45,190
um more rigid in the sense that when you
decide to study physics you don't have a

9740
02:51:45,190 --> 02:51:45,200
decide to study physics you don't have a
 

9741
02:51:45,200 --> 02:51:46,550
decide to study physics you don't have a
lot especially in the early years you

9742
02:51:46,550 --> 02:51:46,560
lot especially in the early years you
 

9743
02:51:46,560 --> 02:51:49,190
lot especially in the early years you
don't have a lot of um you can't choose

9744
02:51:49,190 --> 02:51:49,200
don't have a lot of um you can't choose
 

9745
02:51:49,200 --> 02:51:51,670
don't have a lot of um you can't choose
to take like a class from like computer

9746
02:51:51,670 --> 02:51:51,680
to take like a class from like computer
 

9747
02:51:51,680 --> 02:51:52,870
to take like a class from like computer
science course or something like that

9748
02:51:52,870 --> 02:51:52,880
science course or something like that
 

9749
02:51:52,880 --> 02:51:53,990
science course or something like that
you don't have a lot of freedom to

9750
02:51:53,990 --> 02:51:54,000
you don't have a lot of freedom to
 

9751
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,070
you don't have a lot of freedom to
explore in that sense in university as

9752
02:51:56,070 --> 02:51:56,080
explore in that sense in university as
 

9753
02:51:56,080 --> 02:51:57,590
explore in that sense in university as
opposed to here in the us where you have

9754
02:51:57,590 --> 02:51:57,600
opposed to here in the us where you have
 

9755
02:51:57,600 --> 02:52:00,790
opposed to here in the us where you have
more freedom and i think um

9756
02:52:00,790 --> 02:52:00,800
more freedom and i think um
 

9757
02:52:00,800 --> 02:52:02,469
more freedom and i think um
i think that's important i think that's

9758
02:52:02,469 --> 02:52:02,479
i think that's important i think that's
 

9759
02:52:02,479 --> 02:52:04,710
i think that's important i think that's
what constitutes you know a good kind of

9760
02:52:04,710 --> 02:52:04,720
what constitutes you know a good kind of
 

9761
02:52:04,720 --> 02:52:06,790
what constitutes you know a good kind of
educational system is one that

9762
02:52:06,790 --> 02:52:06,800
educational system is one that
 

9763
02:52:06,800 --> 02:52:09,110
educational system is one that
gravitates towards the interests of a

9764
02:52:09,110 --> 02:52:09,120
gravitates towards the interests of a
 

9765
02:52:09,120 --> 02:52:11,670
gravitates towards the interests of a
student as as you progress but i think

9766
02:52:11,670 --> 02:52:11,680
student as as you progress but i think
 

9767
02:52:11,680 --> 02:52:13,670
student as as you progress but i think
in order for you to do that you need to

9768
02:52:13,670 --> 02:52:13,680
in order for you to do that you need to
 

9769
02:52:13,680 --> 02:52:15,750
in order for you to do that you need to
explore different areas and i i felt

9770
02:52:15,750 --> 02:52:15,760
explore different areas and i i felt
 

9771
02:52:15,760 --> 02:52:18,309
explore different areas and i i felt
like if i had a chance to take say more

9772
02:52:18,309 --> 02:52:18,319
like if i had a chance to take say more
 

9773
02:52:18,319 --> 02:52:19,670
like if i had a chance to take say more
computer science class when i was in

9774
02:52:19,670 --> 02:52:19,680
computer science class when i was in
 

9775
02:52:19,680 --> 02:52:21,269
computer science class when i was in
college i would have probably

9776
02:52:21,269 --> 02:52:21,279
college i would have probably
 

9777
02:52:21,279 --> 02:52:23,750
college i would have probably
have taken those classes but um yeah but

9778
02:52:23,750 --> 02:52:23,760
have taken those classes but um yeah but
 

9779
02:52:23,760 --> 02:52:25,750
have taken those classes but um yeah but
i ended up like focusing maybe too

9780
02:52:25,750 --> 02:52:25,760
i ended up like focusing maybe too
 

9781
02:52:25,760 --> 02:52:27,750
i ended up like focusing maybe too
too much in physics and i think you're

9782
02:52:27,750 --> 02:52:27,760
too much in physics and i think you're
 

9783
02:52:27,760 --> 02:52:28,950
too much in physics and i think you're
at least

9784
02:52:28,950 --> 02:52:28,960
at least
 

9785
02:52:28,960 --> 02:52:30,710
at least
my perception is that you can explore

9786
02:52:30,710 --> 02:52:30,720
my perception is that you can explore
 

9787
02:52:30,720 --> 02:52:32,550
my perception is that you can explore
more more

9788
02:52:32,550 --> 02:52:32,560
more more
 

9789
02:52:32,560 --> 02:52:35,750
more more
fields but there is a kind of it's funny

9790
02:52:35,750 --> 02:52:35,760
fields but there is a kind of it's funny
 

9791
02:52:35,760 --> 02:52:38,469
fields but there is a kind of it's funny
but physics can be difficult

9792
02:52:38,469 --> 02:52:38,479
but physics can be difficult
 

9793
02:52:38,479 --> 02:52:40,230
but physics can be difficult
so i don't see too many computer science

9794
02:52:40,230 --> 02:52:40,240
so i don't see too many computer science
 

9795
02:52:40,240 --> 02:52:41,349
so i don't see too many computer science
people than

9796
02:52:41,349 --> 02:52:41,359
people than
 

9797
02:52:41,359 --> 02:52:43,269
people than
exploring into physics it's only like

9798
02:52:43,269 --> 02:52:43,279
exploring into physics it's only like
 

9799
02:52:43,279 --> 02:52:44,630
exploring into physics it's only like
the one

9800
02:52:44,630 --> 02:52:44,640
the one
 

9801
02:52:44,640 --> 02:52:47,349
the one
the not the one but one of the

9802
02:52:47,349 --> 02:52:47,359
the not the one but one of the
 

9803
02:52:47,359 --> 02:52:49,190
the not the one but one of the
beneficial things of physics it feels

9804
02:52:49,190 --> 02:52:49,200
beneficial things of physics it feels
 

9805
02:52:49,200 --> 02:52:51,030
beneficial things of physics it feels
like it

9806
02:52:51,030 --> 02:52:51,040
like it
 

9807
02:52:51,040 --> 02:52:52,070
like it
uh

9808
02:52:52,070 --> 02:52:52,080
uh
 

9809
02:52:52,080 --> 02:52:55,670
uh
what was it rutherford that said like

9810
02:52:55,670 --> 02:52:55,680
what was it rutherford that said like
 

9811
02:52:55,680 --> 02:52:57,670
what was it rutherford that said like
like basically that physics is the hard

9812
02:52:57,670 --> 02:52:57,680
like basically that physics is the hard
 

9813
02:52:57,680 --> 02:53:00,070
like basically that physics is the hard
thing and everything is easy uh so like

9814
02:53:00,070 --> 02:53:00,080
thing and everything is easy uh so like
 

9815
02:53:00,080 --> 02:53:01,349
thing and everything is easy uh so like
there's a certain sense once you've

9816
02:53:01,349 --> 02:53:01,359
there's a certain sense once you've
 

9817
02:53:01,359 --> 02:53:04,070
there's a certain sense once you've
figured out some basic like physics

9818
02:53:04,070 --> 02:53:04,080
figured out some basic like physics
 

9819
02:53:04,080 --> 02:53:05,670
figured out some basic like physics
that it's not that you need the tools of

9820
02:53:05,670 --> 02:53:05,680
that it's not that you need the tools of
 

9821
02:53:05,680 --> 02:53:07,750
that it's not that you need the tools of
physics to understand the other

9822
02:53:07,750 --> 02:53:07,760
physics to understand the other
 

9823
02:53:07,760 --> 02:53:10,070
physics to understand the other
disciplines it's that you're empowered

9824
02:53:10,070 --> 02:53:10,080
disciplines it's that you're empowered
 

9825
02:53:10,080 --> 02:53:12,389
disciplines it's that you're empowered
by having done difficult [\h__\h] i mean the

9826
02:53:12,389 --> 02:53:12,399
by having done difficult [\h__\h] i mean the
 

9827
02:53:12,399 --> 02:53:14,309
by having done difficult [\h__\h] i mean the
ultimate i think is probably mathematics

9828
02:53:14,309 --> 02:53:14,319
ultimate i think is probably mathematics
 

9829
02:53:14,319 --> 02:53:15,830
ultimate i think is probably mathematics
there yeah true

9830
02:53:15,830 --> 02:53:15,840
there yeah true
 

9831
02:53:15,840 --> 02:53:19,429
there yeah true
uh so maybe just doing difficult things

9832
02:53:19,429 --> 02:53:19,439
uh so maybe just doing difficult things
 

9833
02:53:19,439 --> 02:53:20,870
uh so maybe just doing difficult things
and proving to yourself that you can do

9834
02:53:20,870 --> 02:53:20,880
and proving to yourself that you can do
 

9835
02:53:20,880 --> 02:53:22,469
and proving to yourself that you can do
difficult things whatever those are

9836
02:53:22,469 --> 02:53:22,479
difficult things whatever those are
 

9837
02:53:22,479 --> 02:53:24,070
difficult things whatever those are
that's not positive i believe not

9838
02:53:24,070 --> 02:53:24,080
that's not positive i believe not
 

9839
02:53:24,080 --> 02:53:26,630
that's not positive i believe not
positive yeah and i think like i i

9840
02:53:26,630 --> 02:53:26,640
positive yeah and i think like i i
 

9841
02:53:26,640 --> 02:53:28,630
positive yeah and i think like i i
before i started a company i had like i

9842
02:53:28,630 --> 02:53:28,640
before i started a company i had like i
 

9843
02:53:28,640 --> 02:53:29,910
before i started a company i had like i
worked in

9844
02:53:29,910 --> 02:53:29,920
worked in
 

9845
02:53:29,920 --> 02:53:32,469
worked in
the financial sector for a bit and like

9846
02:53:32,469 --> 02:53:32,479
the financial sector for a bit and like
 

9847
02:53:32,479 --> 02:53:34,469
the financial sector for a bit and like
i think having a physics background i

9848
02:53:34,469 --> 02:53:34,479
i think having a physics background i
 

9849
02:53:34,479 --> 02:53:36,469
i think having a physics background i
was i felt i was not afraid of like

9850
02:53:36,469 --> 02:53:36,479
was i felt i was not afraid of like
 

9851
02:53:36,479 --> 02:53:39,030
was i felt i was not afraid of like
learning like finance things and i think

9852
02:53:39,030 --> 02:53:39,040
learning like finance things and i think
 

9853
02:53:39,040 --> 02:53:40,230
learning like finance things and i think
like when you come from those

9854
02:53:40,230 --> 02:53:40,240
like when you come from those
 

9855
02:53:40,240 --> 02:53:42,309
like when you come from those
backgrounds you are generally not afraid

9856
02:53:42,309 --> 02:53:42,319
backgrounds you are generally not afraid
 

9857
02:53:42,319 --> 02:53:44,389
backgrounds you are generally not afraid
of stepping into other fields and

9858
02:53:44,389 --> 02:53:44,399
of stepping into other fields and
 

9859
02:53:44,399 --> 02:53:46,150
of stepping into other fields and
learning about those because

9860
02:53:46,150 --> 02:53:46,160
learning about those because
 

9861
02:53:46,160 --> 02:53:47,990
learning about those because
um yeah i feel they've learned a lot of

9862
02:53:47,990 --> 02:53:48,000
um yeah i feel they've learned a lot of
 

9863
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,230
um yeah i feel they've learned a lot of
difficult things and um

9864
02:53:50,230 --> 02:53:50,240
difficult things and um
 

9865
02:53:50,240 --> 02:53:53,990
difficult things and um
