it's it's mystery

614
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:19,760
it's it's mystery
 

615
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,790
it's it's mystery
like it starts off about mystery so what

616
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:22,800
like it starts off about mystery so what
 

617
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,990
like it starts off about mystery so what
are you what are you doing

618
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
are you what are you doing
 

619
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,790
are you what are you doing
you're doing this alternation between

620
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:26,800
you're doing this alternation between
 

621
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,430
you're doing this alternation between
the

622
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:27,440
the
 

623
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,910
the
two chords so three notes at the same

624
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:29,920
two chords so three notes at the same
 

625
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,350
two chords so three notes at the same
time one is called

626
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:31,360
time one is called
 

627
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,949
time one is called
the the tonic or you have the the

628
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:34,959
the the tonic or you have the the
 

629
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,710
the the tonic or you have the the
major and the relative minor and he's

630
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:36,720
major and the relative minor and he's
 

631
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,230
major and the relative minor and he's
alternating between them

632
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
alternating between them
 

633
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,750
alternating between them
there's only one note of difference

634
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:39,760
there's only one note of difference
 

635
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,430
there's only one note of difference
between those two chords one of them

636
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:41,440
between those two chords one of them
 

637
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:41,910
between those two chords one of them
would be

638
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:41,920
would be
 

639
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,590
would be
feeling sad one of them would be more

640
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600
feeling sad one of them would be more
 

641
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,630
feeling sad one of them would be more
joyous typically described

642
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:46,640
joyous typically described
 

643
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,550
joyous typically described
and so by altering one note it's the

644
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:48,560
and so by altering one note it's the
 

645
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,230
and so by altering one note it's the
minimal amount to take you back and

646
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,240
minimal amount to take you back and
 

647
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,949
minimal amount to take you back and
forth between joy and happiness

648
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:52,959
forth between joy and happiness
 

649
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,590
forth between joy and happiness

its the fact that it's purely acoustic
 

1625
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,870
its the fact that it's purely acoustic
for some reason i always i couldn't

1631
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,990
eddie van halen separates from the band
in front of thousands of people

1632
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:50,000
in front of thousands of people
 

1633
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,149
in front of thousands of people
just screaming and rocking out with

yeah like it made me imagine that

1658
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:14,880
yeah like it made me imagine that
 

1659
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,870
yeah like it made me imagine that
there's like some half naked supermodel

1660
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:18,880
there's like some half naked supermodel
 

1661
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,830
there's like some half naked supermodel
walking around hoping that uh they can

1662
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:21,840
walking around hoping that uh they can

yeah they did i don't think it's as good

1700
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:58,960
yeah they did i don't think it's as good
 

1701
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,990
yeah they did i don't think it's as good
as differential geometry i'm sorry i do

1702
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,000
as differential geometry i'm sorry i do
 

1703
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,870
as differential geometry i'm sorry i do
think

1704
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:02,880
think
 

1705
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,149

because it's very difficult to
 

1711
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,590
because it's very difficult to
communicate differential geometry at

1712
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:09,600
communicate differential geometry at
 

1713
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,149
communicate differential geometry at
scale

1761
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,590
let's have the jimi hendrix conversation
i don't know that we can do anything to

00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:53,600
i don't know that we can do anything to
 

1763
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,990
i don't know that we can do anything to
it that hasn't already been done to it

1764
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:56,000
it that hasn't already been done to it
 

1765
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,510
it that hasn't already been done to it
maybe that's not true maybe the idea is

maybe that's not true maybe the idea is
 

1767
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,510
maybe that's not true maybe the idea is
that every generation has to have its

really do think that part of

2118
00:36:09,109 --> 00:36:09,119
really do think that part of
 

2119
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,510
really do think that part of
what we call podcasting is actually just

2120
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:11,520
what we call podcasting is actually just
 

2121
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,870
what we call podcasting is actually just
getting to know a soul

00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,030
right over and over again like yeah
maybe the idea is that this is talking

2126
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:19,040
maybe the idea is that this is talking
 

2127
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,750
maybe the idea is that this is talking
about

2128
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:19,760
about
 

2129
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,349
about

depression
 

2149
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,310
depression
i i do think that we're in a really

2150
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:48,320
i i do think that we're in a really
 

2151
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,310
i i do think that we're in a really
terrifying and depressing

terrifying and depressing
 

2153
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,069
terrifying and depressing
time and i think that part of it is

2154
00:36:54,069 --> 00:36:54,079
time and i think that part of it is
 

2155
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,829
time and i think that part of it is
we don't know if something huge is about

2156
00:36:55,829 --> 00:36:55,839
we don't know if something huge is about
 

2157
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,190
we don't know if something huge is about
to get started

2158
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:57,200
to get started
 

2159
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,349
to get started
and we don't even know what this is i

2160
00:36:59,349 --> 00:36:59,359
and we don't even know what this is i
 

2161
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:00,310
and we don't even know what this is i
mean we just

2162
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:00,320
mean we just
 

2163
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,069
mean we just
sit here in this weird world that is

2164
00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:02,079
sit here in this weird world that is
 

2165
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,310
sit here in this weird world that is
falling into some new state

2166
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:04,320
falling into some new state
 

2167
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,390
falling into some new state
and we're not even super curious it's

2168
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:06,400
and we're not even super curious it's
 

2169
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,630
and we're not even super curious it's
like what the hell just happened

2170
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:08,640
like what the hell just happened
 

2171
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,069
like what the hell just happened
everybody's got an answer and i'm

2172
00:37:10,069 --> 00:37:10,079
everybody's got an answer and i'm
 

2173
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,670
everybody's got an answer and i'm
positive that all of those answers are

2174
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:11,680
positive that all of those answers are
 

2175
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,270
positive that all of those answers are
wrong

2176
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:13,280
wrong
 

2177
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,349
wrong
let's let's try to at least sneak up on

2178
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:15,359
let's let's try to at least sneak up on
 

2179
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,270
let's let's try to at least sneak up on
the good answer

2180
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:17,280
the good answer
 

2181
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,990
the good answer
so the central core of the answer is

2182
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:20,000
so the central core of the answer is
 

2183
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,790
so the central core of the answer is
that the us

2184
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:20,800
that the us
 

2185
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,870
that the us
seemed to be the greatest thing in the

2186
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:22,880
seemed to be the greatest thing in the
 

2187
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,069
seemed to be the greatest thing in the
world

2188
00:37:24,069 --> 00:37:24,079
world
 

2189
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,750
world
in large measure because we hadn't

2190
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:25,760
in large measure because we hadn't
 

2191
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,430
in large measure because we hadn't
noticed

2192
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:27,440
noticed
 

2193
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,270
noticed
that we were getting a benefit from

2194
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:29,280
that we were getting a benefit from
 

2195
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,630
that we were getting a benefit from
having no plan

2196
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:30,640
having no plan
 

2197
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,150
having no plan
not having to make a plan for low growth

2198
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:34,160
not having to make a plan for low growth
 

2199
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,630
not having to make a plan for low growth
as long as we had growth we were in

2200
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:36,640
as long as we had growth we were in
 

2201
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,230
as long as we had growth we were in
great shape

2202
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:38,240
great shape
 

2203
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,670
great shape
let's imagine that there was a that

2204
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:41,680
let's imagine that there was a that
 

2205
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,109
let's imagine that there was a that
you could run an experiment you have a

2206
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:43,119
you could run an experiment you have a
 

2207
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,870
you could run an experiment you have a
billion copies of earth and you start

2208
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:44,880
billion copies of earth and you start
 

2209
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,390
billion copies of earth and you start
the initial conditions slightly

2210
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:46,400
the initial conditions slightly
 

2211
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,150
the initial conditions slightly
different

2212
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:48,160
different
 

2213
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,190
different
on some giant number of planets a lot of

2214
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:51,200
on some giant number of planets a lot of
 

2215
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,950
on some giant number of planets a lot of
the things

2216
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:52,960
the things
 

2217
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,030
the things
that were discovered from the 1800s

2218
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:57,040
that were discovered from the 1800s
 

2219
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,950
that were discovered from the 1800s
through the end of the 20th century are

2220
00:37:58,950 --> 00:37:58,960
through the end of the 20th century are
 

2221
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,950
through the end of the 20th century are
discovered in a period of

2222
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:00,960
discovered in a period of
 

2223
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,510
discovered in a period of
time because a lot of that just has to

2224
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:03,520
time because a lot of that just has to
 

2225
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,510
time because a lot of that just has to
do with once you crack the puzzle of

2226
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:05,520
do with once you crack the puzzle of
 

2227
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,430
do with once you crack the puzzle of
getting better instruments you can see

2228
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:07,440
getting better instruments you can see
 

2229
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:07,910
getting better instruments you can see
more

2230
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:07,920
more
 

2231
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,510
more
and the more you can see the more you

2232
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:09,520
and the more you can see the more you
 

2233
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,190
and the more you can see the more you
can make use of what you can see and it

2234
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:11,200
can make use of what you can see and it
 

2235
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,750
can make use of what you can see and it
turns out there was lots of stuff to do

2236
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:13,760
turns out there was lots of stuff to do
 

2237
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,430
turns out there was lots of stuff to do
with like you know germs or

2238
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:17,440
with like you know germs or
 

2239
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,470
with like you know germs or
electron orbitals or you know

2240
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:20,480
electron orbitals or you know
 

2241
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,190
electron orbitals or you know
spectrum electromagnetic spectrum and so

2242
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:23,200
spectrum electromagnetic spectrum and so
 

2243
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,270
spectrum electromagnetic spectrum and so
we got to do all of those things

2244
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:25,280
we got to do all of those things
 

2245
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,510
we got to do all of those things
and the us roughly corresponded for a

2246
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:27,520
and the us roughly corresponded for a
 

2247
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,190
and the us roughly corresponded for a
good chunk of its history with this

2248
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:29,200
good chunk of its history with this
 

2249
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,390
good chunk of its history with this
bonanza

2250
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:30,400
bonanza
 

2251
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,190
bonanza
and so of course we look like an amazing

2252
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:33,200
and so of course we look like an amazing
 

2253
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,750
and so of course we look like an amazing
genius country we have no plan

2254
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:35,760
genius country we have no plan
 

2255
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,349
genius country we have no plan
imagine that you you could sell a car

2256
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:37,359
imagine that you you could sell a car
 

2257
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:38,710
imagine that you you could sell a car
you don't have to put in seat belts you

2258
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:38,720
you don't have to put in seat belts you
 

2259
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,550
you don't have to put in seat belts you
don't have to put in airbags

2260
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:40,560
don't have to put in airbags
 

2261
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,750
don't have to put in airbags
you don't have to put in rear view

2262
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:41,760
you don't have to put in rear view
 

2263
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,589
you don't have to put in rear view
mirrors or sensors or

2264
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:43,599
mirrors or sensors or
 

2265
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,430
mirrors or sensors or
a rear view mirror you could save a lot

2266
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:45,440
a rear view mirror you could save a lot
 

2267
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,829
a rear view mirror you could save a lot
of money on a car by not putting in all

2268
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:47,839
of money on a car by not putting in all
 

2269
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:48,870
of money on a car by not putting in all
of the stuff

2270
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:48,880
of the stuff
 

2271
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,990
of the stuff
to keep things from going wrong

2272
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:52,000
to keep things from going wrong
 

2273
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,510
to keep things from going wrong
and i think that's what we had we had a

2274
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:53,520
and i think that's what we had we had a
 

2275
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,190
and i think that's what we had we had a
machine

2276
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:55,200
machine
 

2277
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,589
machine
that as long as growth was insanely good

2278
00:38:57,589 --> 00:38:57,599
that as long as growth was insanely good
 

2279
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:58,950
that as long as growth was insanely good
we plowed it back

2280
00:38:58,950 --> 00:38:58,960
we plowed it back
 

2281
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,270
we plowed it back
the riches and spoils and then treasure

2282
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:01,280
the riches and spoils and then treasure
 

2283
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,430
the riches and spoils and then treasure
back into the system and made more

2284
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:03,440
back into the system and made more
 

2285
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,150
back into the system and made more
genius stuff and we carried along a good

2286
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:06,160
genius stuff and we carried along a good
 

2287
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,750
genius stuff and we carried along a good
chunk of humanity hundreds of millions

2288
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:07,760
chunk of humanity hundreds of millions
 

2289
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,190
chunk of humanity hundreds of millions
of people

2290
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:09,200
of people
 

2291
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,349
of people
we did not have a plan for what happens

2292
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:11,359
we did not have a plan for what happens
 

2293
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,870
we did not have a plan for what happens
when the growth goes below

2294
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:12,880
when the growth goes below
 

2295
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,990
when the growth goes below
the stall speed of our society

2296
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:16,000
the stall speed of our society
 

2297
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,510
the stall speed of our society
how confident should we be that the

2298
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:17,520
how confident should we be that the
 

2299
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,349
how confident should we be that the
growth has slowed in

2300
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:19,359
growth has slowed in
 

2301
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,310
growth has slowed in
in a way that uh is permanent rather

2302
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:22,320
in a way that uh is permanent rather
 

2303
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,349
in a way that uh is permanent rather
than

2304
00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:23,359
than
 

2305
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,470
than
a kind of slap in the face where is that

2306
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:26,480
a kind of slap in the face where is that
 

2307
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,670
a kind of slap in the face where is that
the right concept

2308
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:27,680
the right concept
 

2309
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,190
the right concept
right concept is i i try to use the same

2310
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:31,200
right concept is i i try to use the same
 

2311
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,870
right concept is i i try to use the same
words over and over again in case people

2312
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:32,880
words over and over again in case people
 

2313
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,829
words over and over again in case people
see mold because then

2314
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:33,839
see mold because then
 

2315
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,349
see mold because then
the perseveration actually gets

2316
00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:35,359
the perseveration actually gets
 

2317
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,109
the perseveration actually gets
somewhere so i use this analogy of the

2318
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:37,119
somewhere so i use this analogy of the
 

2319
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:37,910
somewhere so i use this analogy of the
orchard

2320
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:37,920
orchard
 

2321
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,510
orchard
because everyone talks about low-hanging

2322
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:39,520
because everyone talks about low-hanging
 

2323
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,829
because everyone talks about low-hanging
fruit they know the concept of

2324
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:41,839
fruit they know the concept of
 

2325
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,349
fruit they know the concept of
low-hanging fruit

2326
00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:43,359
low-hanging fruit
 

2327
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,990
low-hanging fruit
but they don't think in terms of

2328
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:46,000
but they don't think in terms of
 

2329
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,109
but they don't think in terms of
orchards

2330
00:39:47,109 --> 00:39:47,119
orchards
 

2331
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,349
orchards
so they say things like you think we've

2332
00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:49,359
so they say things like you think we've
 

2333
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:50,950
so they say things like you think we've
picked all the low-hanging fruit but i

2334
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:50,960
picked all the low-hanging fruit but i
 

2335
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,790
picked all the low-hanging fruit but i
believe in the infinite inventiveness of

2336
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:52,800
believe in the infinite inventiveness of
 

2337
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,829
believe in the infinite inventiveness of
the human mind

2338
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:53,839
the human mind
 

2339
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,470
the human mind
yeah it's like okay that doesn't even

2340
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:56,480
yeah it's like okay that doesn't even
 

2341
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,550
yeah it's like okay that doesn't even
work as an analogy

2342
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:58,560
work as an analogy
 

2343
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,150
work as an analogy
what if the idea is we only picked all

2344
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:00,160
what if the idea is we only picked all
 

2345
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,829
what if the idea is we only picked all
the low-hanging fruit here and then

2346
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:01,839
the low-hanging fruit here and then
 

2347
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,349
the low-hanging fruit here and then
we're having this stupid argument about

2348
00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:03,359
we're having this stupid argument about
 

2349
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,950
we're having this stupid argument about
low-hanging fruit and we're not going

2350
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:04,960
low-hanging fruit and we're not going
 

2351
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,710
low-hanging fruit and we're not going
and looking for new orchards

2352
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:06,720
and looking for new orchards
 

2353
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,069
and looking for new orchards
we're not planting new orchards we're

2354
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:08,079
we're not planting new orchards we're
 

2355
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,910
we're not planting new orchards we're
not looking for forests we're we're just

2356
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:09,920
not looking for forests we're we're just
 

2357
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,430
not looking for forests we're we're just
sitting here arguing about low-hanging

2358
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:11,440
sitting here arguing about low-hanging
 

2359
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,950
sitting here arguing about low-hanging
fruit so my claim is there's probably a

2360
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:12,960
fruit so my claim is there's probably a
 

2361
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,550
fruit so my claim is there's probably a
lot more low-hanging fruit and it's not

2362
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:14,560
lot more low-hanging fruit and it's not
 

2363
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,589
lot more low-hanging fruit and it's not
here

2364
00:40:15,589 --> 00:40:15,599
here
 

2365
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,030
here
it's in other orchards it's in other

2366
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:17,040
it's in other orchards it's in other
 

2367
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,550
it's in other orchards it's in other
orchards one of those turned out to be

2368
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:18,560
orchards one of those turned out to be
 

2369
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,910
orchards one of those turned out to be
the digital orchard

2370
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:19,920
the digital orchard
 

2371
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,829
the digital orchard
the digital orchard has not been a

2372
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:22,839
the digital orchard has not been a
 

2373
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:24,230
the digital orchard has not been a
stagnant

2374
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:24,240
stagnant
 

2375
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,030
stagnant
as lots of these other like the chemical

2376
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:27,040
as lots of these other like the chemical
 

2377
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,750
as lots of these other like the chemical
uh

2378
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:27,760
uh
 

2379
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,270
uh
orchard you know i have faith

2380
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:31,280
orchard you know i have faith
 

2381
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,589
orchard you know i have faith
that there is a small percentage of the

2382
00:40:33,589 --> 00:40:33,599
that there is a small percentage of the
 

2383
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,030
that there is a small percentage of the
population

2384
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:35,040
population
 

2385
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,349
population
but not zero that's looking for those

2386
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:37,359
but not zero that's looking for those
 

2387
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:38,069
but not zero that's looking for those
other orchards

2388
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:38,079
other orchards
 

2389
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,589
other orchards
like i'm excited about one of those

2390
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:39,599
like i'm excited about one of those
 

2391
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,349
like i'm excited about one of those
orchards which is

2392
00:40:41,349 --> 00:40:41,359
orchards which is
 

2393
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:42,870
orchards which is
i believe there will be robots in

2394
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:42,880
i believe there will be robots in
 

2395
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,710
i believe there will be robots in
everybody's homes and that will unlock

2396
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:44,720
everybody's homes and that will unlock
 

2397
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,870
everybody's homes and that will unlock
some totally new thing

2398
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:48,880
some totally new thing
 

2399
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,589
some totally new thing
totally new set of technologies ideas

2400
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:51,599
totally new set of technologies ideas
 

2401
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,109
totally new set of technologies ideas
the way we live life

2402
00:40:53,109 --> 00:40:53,119
the way we live life
 

2403
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,309
the way we live life
the productivity all the everything

2404

2407
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,750
it'll change everything so i'm excited
about that orchard so i'm si

2408
00:40:59,750 --> 00:40:59,760
about that orchard so i'm si
 

2409
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,069
about that orchard so i'm si
you know i'm roaming that orchard and

2410
00:41:02,069 --> 00:41:02,079
you know i'm roaming that orchard and
 

2411

source of food
 

2451
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,870
source of food
yeah right and then it comes back to the

2452
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:40,880
yeah right and then it comes back to the
 

2453
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,670
yeah right and then it comes back to the
colony

2454
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:41,680
colony
 

2455
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,190
colony
and it says hey i think i found a new

2456
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:43,200
and it says hey i think i found a new
 

2457
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,109
and it says hey i think i found a new
source of food and the

2458
00:41:45,109 --> 00:41:45,119
source of food and the
 

2459
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,510
source of food and the
initial reaction is you're not you're

2460
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:47,520
initial reaction is you're not you're
 

2461

finding new orchards
 

2485
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:09,030
finding new orchards
and i think that what we find is that

2486
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:09,040
and i think that what we find is that
 

2487
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,630
and i think that what we find is that
where there's a system that allows

2488
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:10,640
where there's a system that allows
 

2489
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,550
where there's a system that allows
somebody to ascend without a lot of

that solves
 

3177
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,470
that solves
most of the problems i think you can

3178
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:10,480
most of the problems i think you can
 

3179
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,549
most of the problems i think you can
always improve what we have

always improve what we have
 

3181
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,069
always improve what we have
but i don't think that converges in

but i don't think that converges in
 

3183
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:15,910
but i don't think that converges in
something that really works because i

something that really works because i

let's call it meta violence so that we

3538
01:00:30,069 --> 01:00:30,079
let's call it meta violence so that we
 

3539
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,230
let's call it meta violence so that we

don't get into the the problem
 

3541
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,829
don't get into the the problem
we already have a term for physical

3542
01:00:33,829 --> 01:00:33,839
we already have a term for physical
 

3543
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:35,910
we already have a term for physical
violence right so we have meta violence

3544
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:35,920
violence right so we have meta violence
 

3545
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,910
violence right so we have meta violence
and physical violence i would say that

3546
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:37,920

one of the reasons that i try to come up

5144
01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:43,120
one of the reasons that i try to come up
 

5145
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:45,030
one of the reasons that i try to come up
with unifying explanations

5146
01:28:45,030 --> 01:28:45,040
with unifying explanations
 

5147
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:47,350
with unifying explanations
is that you know if you look at the

5148
01:28:47,350 --> 01:28:47,360
is that you know if you look at the
 

5149
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,510
is that you know if you look at the
number of wildfires in california

5150
01:28:49,510 --> 01:28:49,520
number of wildfires in california
 

5151
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:51,990
number of wildfires in california
let's say that we've just seen if you

5152
01:28:51,990 --> 01:28:52,000
let's say that we've just seen if you
 

5153
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,750
let's say that we've just seen if you
treat them all as spontaneous

5154
01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:53,760
treat them all as spontaneous
 

5155
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,790
treat them all as spontaneous
uncorrelated uh instances it feels like

5156
01:28:56,790 --> 01:28:56,800
uncorrelated uh instances it feels like
 

5157
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:57,990

oh my god it's just

5158
01:28:57,990 --> 01:28:58,000
oh my god it's just
 

5159
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,149
oh my god it's just
whack-a-mole every time i send a fire

5160
01:29:00,149 --> 01:29:00,159
whack-a-mole every time i send a fire
 

5161
01:29:00,159 --> 01:29:01,910
whack-a-mole every time i send a fire
truck here there's a fire over there

5162
01:29:01,910 --> 01:29:01,920
truck here there's a fire over there
 

5163
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,510
truck here there's a fire over there
so you want to come up with something

5164
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:03,520
so you want to come up with something
 

5165
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,590
so you want to come up with something
like a central

5166
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:05,600
like a central
 

5167
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,350
like a central
theory which is why do i suddenly have a

5168
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:07,360
theory which is why do i suddenly have a
 

5169
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:08,830
theory which is why do i suddenly have a
problem when i hadn't had a problem

5170
01:29:08,830 --> 01:29:08,840
problem when i hadn't had a problem
 

5171
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:11,510
problem when i hadn't had a problem
before so i look for these unifying

5172
01:29:11,510 --> 01:29:11,520
before so i look for these unifying
 

5173
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,590
before so i look for these unifying
explanations and i found one the other

5174
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:13,600
explanations and i found one the other
 

5175
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:15,590
explanations and i found one the other
day that really speaks to me

5176
01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:15,600
day that really speaks to me
 

5177
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,070

right like they've got this thing
 

7041
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:02,550
right like they've got this thing
figured out so we don't have any way

7042
02:02:02,550 --> 02:02:02,560
figured out so we don't have any way
 

7043
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:06,390

02:02:06,390 --> 02:02:06,400
in and now unity 2024
 

7045
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:09,910
in and now unity 2024
makes sense because unity 2020 was tried

and some we don't
 

7053
02:02:16,480 --> 02:02:18,070
and some we don't
but there's there's a game theoretic

7054
02:02:18,070 --> 02:02:18,080
but there's there's a game theoretic
 

7055
02:02:18,080 --> 02:02:19,189
but there's there's a game theoretic
thing that i'm not sure you're

as a result the children of einstein are

as a result the children of einstein are
 

7395
02:08:34,320 --> 02:08:36,470
as a result the children of einstein are
impoverished because there wasn't as

and so roger's getting on in years and

7532
02:11:06,629 --> 02:11:06,639
and so roger's getting on in years and
 

7533
02:11:06,639 --> 02:11:07,990
and so roger's getting on in years and
the person should be alive

7537
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:12,390
so they i think they meant the rules and
i think they couldn't have bent it for a

i think they couldn't have bent it for a
 

7539
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:14,390
i think they couldn't have bent it for a
better person and i hope they will not

7540
02:11:14,390 --> 02:11:14,400
better person and i hope they will not
 

7541

02:29:38,880 --> 02:29:40,630
universities
and the federal government the taxpayers

8518
02:29:40,630 --> 02:29:40,640
and the federal government the taxpayers
 

8519
02:29:40,640 --> 02:29:41,910
and the federal government the taxpayers
welched

8520
02:29:41,910 --> 02:29:41,920
welched
 

8521
02:29:41,920 --> 02:29:45,190
welched
okay so that's one place to lay the

8522
02:29:45,190 --> 02:29:45,200
okay so that's one place to lay the
 

8523
02:29:45,200 --> 02:29:47,910
okay so that's one place to lay the
blame for jeffrey epstein as that the

8524
02:29:47,910 --> 02:29:47,920
blame for jeffrey epstein as that the
 

8525
02:29:47,920 --> 02:29:50,790
blame for jeffrey epstein as that the
the failure of the federal government to

8526
02:29:50,790 --> 02:29:50,800
the failure of the federal government to
 

8527
02:29:50,800 --> 02:29:51,590
the failure of the federal government to
honor

8528
02:29:51,590 --> 02:29:51,600
honor
 

8529
02:29:51,600 --> 02:29:55,110
honor
to honor its commitment yeah right

8530
02:29:55,110 --> 02:29:55,120
to honor its commitment yeah right
 

8531
02:29:55,120 --> 02:29:57,750
to honor its commitment yeah right
so the universities became psychopathic

8532
02:29:57,750 --> 02:29:57,760
so the universities became psychopathic
 

8533
02:29:57,760 --> 02:29:59,429
so the universities became psychopathic
it's not like everybody doesn't remember

8534
02:29:59,429 --> 02:29:59,439
it's not like everybody doesn't remember
 

8535
02:29:59,439 --> 02:30:01,270
it's not like everybody doesn't remember
what we're supposed to be doing to be

8536
02:30:01,270 --> 02:30:01,280
what we're supposed to be doing to be
 

8537
02:30:01,280 --> 02:30:02,230
what we're supposed to be doing to be
moral

8538
02:30:02,230 --> 02:30:02,240
moral
 

8539
02:30:02,240 --> 02:30:03,830
moral
but the point was there wasn't enough

8540
02:30:03,830 --> 02:30:03,840
but the point was there wasn't enough
 

8541
02:30:03,840 --> 02:30:05,830
but the point was there wasn't enough
money to be moral so it was time

8542
02:30:05,830 --> 02:30:05,840
money to be moral so it was time
 

8543
02:30:05,840 --> 02:30:08,950
money to be moral so it was time
to uh to eye each other as a source of

8544
02:30:08,950 --> 02:30:08,960
to uh to eye each other as a source of
 

8545
02:30:08,960 --> 02:30:10,950
to uh to eye each other as a source of
protein as i like to say

8546
02:30:10,950 --> 02:30:10,960
protein as i like to say
 

8547
02:30:10,960 --> 02:30:14,150
protein as i like to say
and in that process jeffrey epstein said

8548
02:30:14,150 --> 02:30:14,160
and in that process jeffrey epstein said
 

8549
02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:15,349
and in that process jeffrey epstein said
hey

8550
02:30:15,349 --> 02:30:15,359
hey
 

8551
02:30:15,359 --> 02:30:18,550
hey
come to my world we can do it like we

8552
02:30:18,550 --> 02:30:18,560
come to my world we can do it like we
 

8553
02:30:18,560 --> 02:30:21,830
come to my world we can do it like we
used to do

8554
02:30:21,830 --> 02:30:21,840

 

8555
02:30:21,840 --> 02:30:25,190

so in in part my point is is that almost

8556
02:30:25,190 --> 02:30:25,200
so in in part my point is is that almost
 

8557
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:28,550
so in in part my point is is that almost
none of your colleagues at mit have that

8558
02:30:28,550 --> 02:30:28,560
none of your colleagues at mit have that
 

8559
02:30:28,560 --> 02:30:30,790
none of your colleagues at mit have that
kind of religious commitment to science

8560
02:30:30,790 --> 02:30:30,800
kind of religious commitment to science
 

8561
02:30:30,800 --> 02:30:31,990
kind of religious commitment to science
that they're willing to go down

8562
02:30:31,990 --> 02:30:32,000
that they're willing to go down
 

8563
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:35,590
that they're willing to go down
with ship science

8564
02:30:35,590 --> 02:30:35,600

 

8565
02:30:35,600 --> 02:30:38,630

the galileo galilei thing became very

8566
02:30:38,630 --> 02:30:38,640
the galileo galilei thing became very
 

8567
02:30:38,640 --> 02:30:39,990
the galileo galilei thing became very
important to science because

8568
02:30:39,990 --> 02:30:40,000
important to science because
 

8569
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,630
important to science because
occasionally you just have to say

8570
02:30:42,630 --> 02:30:42,640
occasionally you just have to say
 

8571
02:30:42,640 --> 02:30:45,990
occasionally you just have to say

maybe titan and whatever and i don't

8726
02:34:05,270 --> 02:34:05,280
maybe titan and whatever and i don't
 

8727
02:34:05,280 --> 02:34:06,630
maybe titan and whatever and i don't
think it'll work and it doesn't make

8728
02:34:06,630 --> 02:34:06,640
think it'll work and it doesn't make
 

8729
02:34:06,640 --> 02:34:07,830
think it'll work and it doesn't make
sense and it looks silly

8730
02:34:07,830 --> 02:34:07,840
sense and it looks silly
 

8731
02:34:07,840 --> 02:34:09,110
sense and it looks silly
but that's exactly the kind of fight

8732
02:34:09,110 --> 02:34:09,120
but that's exactly the kind of fight
 

8733
02:34:09,120 --> 02:34:10,630
but that's exactly the kind of fight
where it's fighting but it's it's the

8734
02:34:10,630 --> 02:34:10,640
where it's fighting but it's it's the
 

8735
02:34:10,640 --> 02:34:12,389
where it's fighting but it's it's the
kind of it's for the same reason that i

8736
02:34:12,389 --> 02:34:12,399
kind of it's for the same reason that i
 

8737
02:34:12,399 --> 02:34:14,550
kind of it's for the same reason that i
went on brett's unity 2020 thing when i

8738
02:34:14,550 --> 02:34:14,560
went on brett's unity 2020 thing when i
 

8739
02:34:14,560 --> 02:34:15,990
went on brett's unity 2020 thing when i
didn't think it had a hope in hell and

8740
02:34:15,990 --> 02:34:16,000
didn't think it had a hope in hell and
 

8741
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:17,429
didn't think it had a hope in hell and

it
 

8745
02:34:18,080 --> 02:34:20,070
it
we got to do things that make that make

8746
02:34:20,070 --> 02:34:20,080
we got to do things that make that make
 

8747
02:34:20,080 --> 02:34:22,469
we got to do things that make that make
us feel dumb and silly and childish

8748
02:34:22,469 --> 02:34:22,479
us feel dumb and silly and childish
 

8749
02:34:22,479 --> 02:34:24,550
us feel dumb and silly and childish
that possibly have a hope of working

8750
02:34:24,550 --> 02:34:24,560
that possibly have a hope of working
 

8751
02:34:24,560 --> 02:34:25,670
that possibly have a hope of working
okay so

8752
02:34:25,670 --> 02:34:25,680
okay so
 

8753
02:34:25,680 --> 02:34:27,830
okay so
everybody should do something my version

8754
02:34:27,830 --> 02:34:27,840
everybody should do something my version
 

8755
02:34:27,840 --> 02:34:29,590
everybody should do something my version
of this i'm the most hopeful about

8756
02:34:29,590 --> 02:34:29,600
of this i'm the most hopeful about
 

8757
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:30,469
of this i'm the most hopeful about
because

8758
02:34:30,469 --> 02:34:30,479
because
 

8759
02:34:30,479 --> 02:34:31,830
because
i wouldn't have chosen to do if i

8760
02:34:31,830 --> 02:34:31,840
i wouldn't have chosen to do if i
 

8761
02:34:31,840 --> 02:34:33,429
i wouldn't have chosen to do if i
thought that daniel schmochtenberger's

wisdom project
 

8765
02:34:35,120 --> 02:34:38,790
wisdom project
was a better hope i'd do that

8766
02:34:38,790 --> 02:34:38,800
was a better hope i'd do that
 

8767
02:34:38,800 --> 02:34:41,750
was a better hope i'd do that
it's more down to earth in a certain way

8768
02:34:41,750 --> 02:34:41,760
it's more down to earth in a certain way
 

8769
02:34:41,760 --> 02:34:43,990
it's more down to earth in a certain way
i just think that it's more probable

8770
02:34:43,990 --> 02:34:44,000
i just think that it's more probable
 

8771
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,710
i just think that it's more probable
look we got from powered flight with the

in less than a century okay what we can

8780
02:34:56,870 --> 02:34:56,880
in less than a century okay what we can
 

8781
02:34:56,880 --> 02:35:00,550
in less than a century okay what we can
do if we can change the laws of physics

8782
02:35:00,550 --> 02:35:00,560
do if we can change the laws of physics
 

8783
02:35:00,560 --> 02:35:02,870
do if we can change the laws of physics
is something we can't even conceive of

8784
02:35:02,870 --> 02:35:02,880
is something we can't even conceive of
 

8785
02:35:02,880 --> 02:35:04,550
is something we can't even conceive of
it may be that it buys us

8786
02:35:04,550 --> 02:35:04,560
it may be that it buys us
 

8787
02:35:04,560 --> 02:35:08,070
it may be that it buys us
nothing and at least we'll

8788
02:35:08,070 --> 02:35:08,080
nothing and at least we'll
 

8789
02:35:08,080 --> 02:35:11,670
nothing and at least we'll
we will know why we died on this planet

8790
02:35:11,670 --> 02:35:11,680
we will know why we died on this planet
 

8791
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:15,590
we will know why we died on this planet
as a small aside i think this is

8792
02:35:15,590 --> 02:35:15,600
as a small aside i think this is
 

8793
02:35:15,600 --> 02:35:17,270
as a small aside i think this is
not the right time to take the full

8794

not the right time to take the full
 

8795
02:35:17,280 --> 02:35:20,070
not the right time to take the full

through
 

8823
02:35:50,800 --> 02:35:54,230
through
some more intuition about

has roamed around geometric community
around that work

8836
02:36:05,830 --> 02:36:05,840
around that work
 

8837
02:36:05,840 --> 02:36:08,630
around that work
in physics in this fight i'm trying to

8838
02:36:08,630 --> 02:36:08,640
in physics in this fight i'm trying to
 

8839
02:36:08,640 --> 02:36:11,030
in physics in this fight i'm trying to
figure out

8840
02:36:11,030 --> 02:36:11,040
figure out
 

8841
02:36:11,040 --> 02:36:13,429
figure out
when to release it and how i mean i've

8842
02:36:13,429 --> 02:36:13,439
when to release it and how i mean i've
 

8843
02:36:13,439 --> 02:36:15,190
when to release it and how i mean i've
released the video

8844
02:36:15,190 --> 02:36:15,200
released the video
 

8845
02:36:15,200 --> 02:36:18,150
released the video
and the video quite honestly i think it

8846
02:36:18,150 --> 02:36:18,160
and the video quite honestly i think it
 

8847
02:36:18,160 --> 02:36:19,750
and the video quite honestly i think it
has a very bizarre reaction

8848
02:36:19,750 --> 02:36:19,760
has a very bizarre reaction
 

8849
02:36:19,760 --> 02:36:20,870
has a very bizarre reaction
i think one of the things that i've

8850
02:36:20,870 --> 02:36:20,880
i think one of the things that i've
 

8851
02:36:20,880 --> 02:36:22,710
i think one of the things that i've
learned from the video because the video

8852
02:36:22,710 --> 02:36:22,720
learned from the video because the video
 

8853
02:36:22,720 --> 02:36:25,030
learned from the video because the video
is coming up on half a million

the
um the audio but

8860
02:36:32,550 --> 02:36:32,560
um the audio but
 

8861
02:36:32,560 --> 02:36:34,469
um the audio but
yeah it produced a very strange reaction

8862
02:36:34,469 --> 02:36:34,479
yeah it produced a very strange reaction
 

8863
02:36:34,479 --> 02:36:36,070
yeah it produced a very strange reaction
one of the things i don't think that i

8864
02:36:36,070 --> 02:36:36,080
one of the things i don't think that i
 

8865
02:36:36,080 --> 02:36:38,389
one of the things i don't think that i
properly understood is that most

02:38:51,680 --> 02:38:53,590
really the beauty of the universe just
the beauty of an energy level so i think

8992
02:38:53,590 --> 02:38:53,600
the beauty of an energy level so i think
 

8993
02:38:53,600 --> 02:38:56,950
the beauty of an energy level so i think
that renormalization was one of the most

8994

that renormalization was one of the most
