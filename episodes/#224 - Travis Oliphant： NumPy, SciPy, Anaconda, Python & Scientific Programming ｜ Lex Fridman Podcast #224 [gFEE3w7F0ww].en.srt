now sorry for the romanticized question

128
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:23,360
now sorry for the romanticized question
 

129
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,070
now sorry for the romanticized question
but when did you first fall in love with

130
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,080
but when did you first fall in love with
 

131
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,150
but when did you first fall in love with
programming oh man good question i think

132
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
programming oh man good question i think
 

133
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,630
programming oh man good question i think
actually when i was 10 you know my dad

134
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:30,640
actually when i was 10 you know my dad
 

135
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,350
actually when i was 10 you know my dad
got us a t a timex sinclair

136
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:33,360
got us a t a timex sinclair
 

137
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,270
got us a t a timex sinclair
and uh he was excited about the

138
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:35,280
and uh he was excited about the
 

139
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,670
and uh he was excited about the
spreadsheet capability and then but i

140
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:37,680
spreadsheet capability and then but i
 

141
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,070
spreadsheet capability and then but i
made him get the basic the add-on so we

142
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080
made him get the basic the add-on so we
 

143
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,070
made him get the basic the add-on so we
could actually program in basic and just

144
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
could actually program in basic and just
 

145
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,750
could actually program in basic and just
being able to write

146
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
being able to write
 

147
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,190
being able to write
instructions and have the computer do

148
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:45,200
instructions and have the computer do
 

149
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,309
instructions and have the computer do
something then we got a ti-99

150
00:02:47,309 --> 00:02:47,319
something then we got a ti-99
 

151
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:50,229
something then we got a ti-99
ti-994a when i was about 12 and i would

152
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,239
ti-994a when i was about 12 and i would
 

153
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,470
ti-994a when i was about 12 and i would
just it had sprites and graphics and

154
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,480
just it had sprites and graphics and
 

155
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,910
just it had sprites and graphics and
music you could actually program to do

156
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:53,920
music you could actually program to do
 

157
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,110

that's when i really sort of fell in

160
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,120
that's when i really sort of fell in
 

161
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,670
that's when i really sort of fell in
love with programming so this is a full

162
00:02:59,670 --> 00:02:59,680
love with programming so this is a full
 

163
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,390
love with programming so this is a full
like a real computer with like uh

164
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:02,400
like a real computer with like uh
 

165
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,470
like a real computer with like uh
with memory and storage yeah processors

166
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:04,480
with memory and storage yeah processors
 

167
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,390
with memory and storage yeah processors
so what not the type of ti yeah the

168
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:06,400
so what not the type of ti yeah the
 

169
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,070
so what not the type of ti yeah the
timex sinclair was one of the very first

170
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,080
timex sinclair was one of the very first
 

171
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,270
timex sinclair was one of the very first
it was a cheap cheap like i think it was

172
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
it was a cheap cheap like i think it was
 

173
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,350
it was a cheap cheap like i think it was
well it was still expensive but it was

174
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:13,360
well it was still expensive but it was
 

175
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,710
well it was still expensive but it was
2k of memory we got the 16k add-on pack

176
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:16,720
2k of memory we got the 16k add-on pack
 

177
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,149
2k of memory we got the 16k add-on pack
but yeah it had memory and you could

178
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:18,159
but yeah it had memory and you could
 

179
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,149
but yeah it had memory and you could
program it you had the in order to store

180
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:20,159
program it you had the in order to store
 

181
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,990
program it you had the in order to store
your programs you had to attach a tape

182
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,000
your programs you had to attach a tape
 

183
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,910
your programs you had to attach a tape
drive remember that old the sound that

184
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:23,920
drive remember that old the sound that
 

185
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,910
drive remember that old the sound that
would play when you invented the

186
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:25,920
would play when you invented the
 

187
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,710
would play when you invented the
converted the the modems would convert

188
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:28,720
converted the the modems would convert
 

189
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,949
converted the the modems would convert
digital bits to audio files on a tape

190
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959
digital bits to audio files on a tape
 

191
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,509
digital bits to audio files on a tape
drive still remember that sound

192
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:33,519
drive still remember that sound
 

193
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,110
drive still remember that sound
but that was the storage and what was

194
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,120
but that was the storage and what was
 

195
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,390
but that was the storage and what was
the programming language do you remember

196
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400
the programming language do you remember
 

197
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,750
the programming language do you remember
it was basic it was basic and then they

198
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:37,760
it was basic it was basic and then they
 

199
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,670
it was basic it was basic and then they
had a visi calc and so a little bit of

200
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:39,680
had a visi calc and so a little bit of
 

201
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,589
had a visi calc and so a little bit of
spreadsheet programming busy but

202
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
spreadsheet programming busy but
 

203
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,430
spreadsheet programming busy but
mostly just some basic do you remember

204
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,440
mostly just some basic do you remember
 

205
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,670
mostly just some basic do you remember
what kind of things drew you to

206
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:45,680
what kind of things drew you to
 

207
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,670
what kind of things drew you to
programming was it uh

208
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:47,680
programming was it uh
 

209
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,990
programming was it uh
working with data was it video games and

210
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,000
working with data was it video games and
 

211
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,830
working with data was it video games and
video games

212
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
video games
 

213
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,070
video games
mathy stuff yeah i've i've always loved

214
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,080
mathy stuff yeah i've i've always loved
 

215
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,390
mathy stuff yeah i've i've always loved
math and

216
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
math and
 

217
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,589
math and
a lot of people think they don't like

218
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:57,599
a lot of people think they don't like
 

219
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,710
a lot of people think they don't like
math because i think when they're

220
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:58,720
math because i think when they're
 

221
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,789
math because i think when they're
exposed to it early they uh it's about

222
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:00,799
exposed to it early they uh it's about
 

223
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:01,750
exposed to it early they uh it's about
memory

224
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:01,760
memory
 

225
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,710
memory
you know when you're exposed to math

226
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:02,720
you know when you're exposed to math
 

227
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,830
you know when you're exposed to math
earlier you have a good short term

228
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
earlier you have a good short term
 

229
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,750
earlier you have a good short term
memory members timetables

230
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:05,760
memory members timetables
 

231
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,070
memory members timetables
and i i do have a reasonably i mean not

232
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,080
and i i do have a reasonably i mean not
 

233
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,550
and i i do have a reasonably i mean not
perfect but a reasonably long um little

234
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
perfect but a reasonably long um little
 

235
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,390
perfect but a reasonably long um little
short-term memory buffer

236
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:12,400
short-term memory buffer
 

237
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,229
short-term memory buffer
and so i did great at times tables i

238
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:14,239
and so i did great at times tables i
 

239
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,910
and so i did great at times tables i
said oh you're good at math but i

240
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:15,920
said oh you're good at math but i
 

241
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,629
said oh you're good at math but i
started to really like math just the the

242
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:18,639
started to really like math just the the
 

243
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,949
started to really like math just the the
problem solving aspect and so computing

244
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:20,959
problem solving aspect and so computing
 

245
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,069
problem solving aspect and so computing
was

246
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079
was
 

247
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,909
was
problem solving

248
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:23,919
problem solving
 

249
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:24,870
problem solving
applied

250
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:24,880
applied
 

251
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,110
applied
and so that's always kind of been the

252
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,120
and so that's always kind of been the
 

253
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,870
and so that's always kind of been the
draw kind of coupled with the

254
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
draw kind of coupled with the
 

255
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,390
draw kind of coupled with the
mathematics

256
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,400
mathematics
 

257
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,150
mathematics
did you ever see the computer as like an

258
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
did you ever see the computer as like an
 

259
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,830
did you ever see the computer as like an
extension

260
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
extension
 

261
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,909
extension
of your mind like something able to

262
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:35,919
of your mind like something able to
 

263
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,790
of your mind like something able to
achieve not till later okay yeah no not

264
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:38,800
achieve not till later okay yeah no not
 

265
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,310
achieve not till later okay yeah no not
then it's just like a little set of

266
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,320
then it's just like a little set of
 

267
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,670
then it's just like a little set of
puzzles that you can play with and you

268
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,680
puzzles that you can play with and you
 

269
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,350
puzzles that you can play with and you
can you can play with math puzzles and

270
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
can you can play with math puzzles and
 

271
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,590
can you can play with math puzzles and
yeah it was it was too rudimentary early

272
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,600
yeah it was it was too rudimentary early
 

273
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,510
yeah it was it was too rudimentary early
on like it was sort of

274
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:47,520
on like it was sort of
 

275
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,189
on like it was sort of
yeah it was too it was a lot of work to

276
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:49,199
yeah it was too it was a lot of work to
 

277
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,550
yeah it was too it was a lot of work to
actually take

278
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:50,560
actually take
 

279
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,909
actually take
a thought you'd have and actually get it

280
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
a thought you'd have and actually get it
 

281
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,550
a thought you'd have and actually get it
implemented and that's still work but

282
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:54,560
implemented and that's still work but
 

283
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,790
implemented and that's still work but
it's getting easier and

284
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:56,800
it's getting easier and
 

285
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,070
it's getting easier and
so yeah i would say that's definitely

286
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080
so yeah i would say that's definitely
 

287
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,590
so yeah i would say that's definitely
what's attracted me to python is that

288
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
what's attracted me to python is that
 

289
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,350
what's attracted me to python is that
that was more real

290
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
that was more real
 

291
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,070
that was more real
right

292
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,080
right
 

293
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,710
right
i could think in python

294
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
i could think in python
 

295
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,310
i could think in python
speaking a foreign language i only speak

296
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,320
speaking a foreign language i only speak
 

297
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,909
speaking a foreign language i only speak
another language fluently besides

298
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
another language fluently besides
 

299
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,350
another language fluently besides
english which is spanish and i remember

300
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,360
english which is spanish and i remember
 

301
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,510
english which is spanish and i remember
the day when i would dream in spanish

302
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:11,520
the day when i would dream in spanish
 

303
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,270
the day when i would dream in spanish
and you start to think in that language

304
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,280
and you start to think in that language
 

305
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,870
and you start to think in that language
and then you actually i do definitely

306
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:14,880
and then you actually i do definitely
 

307
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,950
and then you actually i do definitely
believe that language

308
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:16,960
believe that language
 

309
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,189
believe that language
limits or expands your thinking

310
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199
limits or expands your thinking
 

311
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,390
limits or expands your thinking
uh there are some languages that

312
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
uh there are some languages that
 

313
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,629
uh there are some languages that
actually lead you to certain

314
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639
actually lead you to certain
 

315
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,590
actually lead you to certain
thought processes yeah like uh

316
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:25,600
thought processes yeah like uh
 

317
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,510
thought processes yeah like uh
so i speak russian fluently and that's

318
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,520
so i speak russian fluently and that's
 

319
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,350
so i speak russian fluently and that's
certainly uh

320
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:29,360
certainly uh
 

321
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,909
certainly uh
a language that leads you down certain

322
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
a language that leads you down certain
 

323
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,029
a language that leads you down certain
thoughts

324
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
thoughts
 

325
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,110
thoughts
well yeah i mean there's a um

326
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120

translated and curious how the
 

381
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,070
translated and curious how the
translations so dostoevsky

382
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
translations so dostoevsky
 

383
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,830
translations so dostoevsky
did not use

384
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:39,840

the scientific world so much of the

490
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:28,960
the scientific world so much of the
 

491
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,350
the scientific world so much of the
technical world is in english

492
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:31,360
technical world is in english
 

493
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,269
technical world is in english
and so much of it might be lost because

494
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:33,279
and so much of it might be lost because
 

495
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,029
and so much of it might be lost because
they're they just we don't have the

496
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,039
they're they just we don't have the
 

497
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,029
they're they just we don't have the
common language i completely agree i'm

498
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:37,039
common language i completely agree i'm
 

499
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,430
common language i completely agree i'm
very much in that vein of

500
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:39,440
very much in that vein of
 

501
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,949
very much in that vein of
there's a lot of genius out there that

502
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:40,959
there's a lot of genius out there that
 

503
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,949
there's a lot of genius out there that
we miss and it's sort of sort of

504
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:42,959
we miss and it's sort of sort of
 

505
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:44,949
we miss and it's sort of sort of
fortunate when it when it bubbles up

506
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
fortunate when it when it bubbles up
 

507
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,829
fortunate when it when it bubbles up
into something that we can understand or

508
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:47,839
into something that we can understand or
 

509
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,150
into something that we can understand or
process there's a lot we miss

510
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,160
process there's a lot we miss
 

511
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,790
process there's a lot we miss
so i tend to lean towards really loving

512
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:52,800
so i tend to lean towards really loving
 

513
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,310
so i tend to lean towards really loving
uh democratization or things that

514
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:54,320
uh democratization or things that
 

515
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,790
uh democratization or things that
empower people or you know i

516
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
empower people or you know i
 

517
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,630

very resistant to sort of authoritarian

fundamentally for that reason it well

00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,160
fundamentally for that reason it well
 

523
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,070
fundamentally for that reason it well
several reasons but it just hurts us

524
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,080
several reasons but it just hurts us
 

525
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,230
several reasons but it just hurts us
yeah we're worse off

526
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,240
yeah we're worse off
 

527
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,550
yeah we're worse off
so speaking of languages that empower

528
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,560
so speaking of languages that empower
 

529
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,829
so speaking of languages that empower
you so

00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:09,839
you so
 

531
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,670

00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:20,560
you first do you remember when you first
 

541
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,470
you first do you remember when you first
kind of connected with python maybe even

542
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,480
kind of connected with python maybe even
 

543
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,829
kind of connected with python maybe even
fell in love with python it's a good

544
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:23,839
fell in love with python it's a good

processing information out of it and i'd
 

569
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,389

scripting of on a vms there's actually a
 

575
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,630
scripting of on a vms there's actually a

little scripting tools uh around fortran
done a lot of that and then

580
00:09:59,670 --> 00:09:59,680
done a lot of that and then
 

581
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,670
done a lot of that and then
as a graduate student i was looking for

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,790
as a graduate student i was looking for
something

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,430
something
and encounter python and because python

00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:05,440
and encounter python and because python
 

587
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,750
and encounter python and because python
had an array had two things that made me

filtering a bunch of stuff as yorick i
 

593
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,949
filtering a bunch of stuff as yorick i
looked at yorick i looked at a few other

594
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:12,959
looked at yorick i looked at a few other
 

595
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,710
looked at yorick i looked at a few other
languages throughout there at the time

in 1997 but it it had arrays there's a

00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:17,920
in 1997 but it it had arrays there's a
 

599
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,590
in 1997 but it it had arrays there's a
library called numeric that had just

00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:19,600
library called numeric that had just
 

601
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,150
library called numeric that had just
been written in 95 like not very

602

00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:28,480
you know and i went back and read the
 

609
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,910
you know and i went back and read the

it's fascinating to do that actually to

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,110
it's fascinating to do that actually to

something maybe we might get into a

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,069
something maybe we might get into a
little later but what that looks like

00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
little later but what that looks like
 

629
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,630
little later but what that looks like
what gap did numeric fill merrick fill

630
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:48,640
what gap did numeric fill merrick fill

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,630
what gap did numeric fill merrick fill
the gap of having an array object so

632
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:50,640
the gap of having an array object so
 

633
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,829
the gap of having an array object so
there was no array out there was no

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,550
uh n-dimensional two three
four-dimensional tensor they call it now

642
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:00,560
four-dimensional tensor they call it now
 

643
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,470
four-dimensional tensor they call it now
i'm still in the category that a tensor

644
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:02,480
i'm still in the category that a tensor
 

645
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,230
i'm still in the category that a tensor
is another thing and it's just an md

646
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,240
is another thing and it's just an md
 

647
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,069
is another thing and it's just an md
array we should call it but yeah kind of

648
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:06,079
array we should call it but yeah kind of
 

649
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,150
array we should call it but yeah kind of
lost that battle

650
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,160
lost that battle
 

651
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,310
lost that battle
there's many battles in this world some

652
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:10,320
there's many battles in this world some
 

653
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,069
there's many battles in this world some
of which will win some we lose that's

654
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:12,079
of which will win some we lose that's
 

655
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,430
of which will win some we lose that's
exactly right

656
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,440
exactly right
 

657
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,310
exactly right
so and but it was uh it had no math to

658
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:16,320
so and but it was uh it had no math to
 

659
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,110
so and but it was uh it had no math to
it so numeric had math and a basic way

660
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,120
it so numeric had math and a basic way
 

661
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,269
it so numeric had math and a basic way
to think in a race so i was looking for

662
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:21,279
to think in a race so i was looking for
 

663
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,790
to think in a race so i was looking for
that and it had complex numbers

664
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:24,800
that and it had complex numbers
 

665
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,710
that and it had complex numbers
a lot of programming languages and you

666
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,720
a lot of programming languages and you
 

667
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,150
a lot of programming languages and you
can see it because you know if you're

668
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,160
can see it because you know if you're
 

669
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,389
can see it because you know if you're
just a computer scientist you think ah

670
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:30,399
just a computer scientist you think ah
 

671
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,710
just a computer scientist you think ah
complex numbers just two floats so you

672
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:32,720
complex numbers just two floats so you
 

673
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,790
complex numbers just two floats so you
can people can build that on

674
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800
can people can build that on
 

675
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,430
can people can build that on
but in practice a complex number as a as

00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,000
think of this the same way which is both
 

707
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,590
think of this the same way which is both
powerful and dangerous

708
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
powerful and dangerous
 

709
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,190
powerful and dangerous
right because

710
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:09,200
right because
 

711
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,670
right because
powerful in that we now can quickly make

00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:11,680
powerful in that we now can quickly make
 

713
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,509
powerful in that we now can quickly make
bigger and higher level things on top of

714
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:13,519
bigger and higher level things on top of
 

715
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,509
bigger and higher level things on top of
those abstractions dangerous because it

716
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:15,519
those abstractions dangerous because it
 

717
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,350
those abstractions dangerous because it
also limits us as to the things we left

718
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:17,360
also limits us as to the things we left
 

719
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,509
also limits us as to the things we left
maybe left behind in producing that

720
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:19,519
maybe left behind in producing that
 

721
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,110
maybe left behind in producing that
abstraction which is at the heart of

722
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,120
abstraction which is at the heart of
 

723
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,949
abstraction which is at the heart of
programming today and actually building

724
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:22,959
programming today and actually building
 

725
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,470
programming today and actually building
around the programming world so i think

726
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:24,480
around the programming world so i think
 

727
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,470
around the programming world so i think
it's a fascinating philosophical topic

728
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:26,480
it's a fascinating philosophical topic
 

729
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,150
it's a fascinating philosophical topic
yeah it will continue for many years i

730
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,160
yeah it will continue for many years i
 

731
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,949
yeah it will continue for many years i
think

732
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:28,959
think
 

733
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,310
think
as it builds more and more and more

734
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:30,320
as it builds more and more and more
 

735
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,150
as it builds more and more and more
abstractions yes i often think about you

736
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
abstractions yes i often think about you
 

737
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,750
abstractions yes i often think about you
know we have we have a world that's

738
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:33,760
know we have we have a world that's
 

739
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,430
know we have we have a world that's
built on these abstractions that were

740
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:35,440
built on these abstractions that were
 

741
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,350
built on these abstractions that were
they the only ones possible yeah

742
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,360
they the only ones possible yeah
 

743
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,670
they the only ones possible yeah
certainly not but they led to

744
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:39,680
certainly not but they led to
 

745
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,269
certainly not but they led to
now it's very hard to to do it

746
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:41,279
now it's very hard to to do it
 

747
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,190
now it's very hard to to do it
differently yeah like there's an inertia

748
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,200
differently yeah like there's an inertia
 

749
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,829
differently yeah like there's an inertia
that's very hard to you know

750
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:45,839
that's very hard to you know
 

751
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,990
that's very hard to you know
push out push away from there's that has

752
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,000
push out push away from there's that has
 

753
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,670
push out push away from there's that has
implications for things like you know

754
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:49,680
implications for things like you know
 

755
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,509
implications for things like you know
the julia language which you have heard

756
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:51,519
the julia language which you have heard
 

757
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,590
the julia language which you have heard
of i'm sure and

758
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:53,600
of i'm sure and
 

759
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,590
of i'm sure and
i've met the creators and i like julia

760
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:55,600
i've met the creators and i like julia
 

761
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,710
i've met the creators and i like julia
it's a really cool language but they've

762
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:56,720
it's a really cool language but they've
 

763
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,389
it's a really cool language but they've
struggled to kind of

764
00:12:58,389 --> 00:12:58,399
struggled to kind of
 

765
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,629
struggled to kind of
against the just the tide of like this

766
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:00,639
against the just the tide of like this
 

767
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,269
against the just the tide of like this
inertia of people using python and

768
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:03,279
inertia of people using python and
 

769
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,030
inertia of people using python and
and you know there's strategies to

770
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,040
and you know there's strategies to
 

771
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,710
and you know there's strategies to
approach that but nonetheless it's a

772
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
approach that but nonetheless it's a
 

773
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,710
approach that but nonetheless it's a
it's a phenomena and sometimes so i love

774
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:08,720
it's a phenomena and sometimes so i love
 

775
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,710
it's a phenomena and sometimes so i love
complex numbers and i love to raise so i

776
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:10,720
complex numbers and i love to raise so i
 

777
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,150
complex numbers and i love to raise so i
looked at python

778
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,160
looked at python
 

779
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,829
looked at python
and then i had the experience i did some

780
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:13,839
and then i had the experience i did some
 

781
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,829
and then i had the experience i did some
stuff in python and i was just doing my

782
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:15,839
stuff in python and i was just doing my
 

783
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,509
stuff in python and i was just doing my
phd so i was out my focus was on

784
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:19,519
phd so i was out my focus was on
 

785
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,949
phd so i was out my focus was on
i was actually doing a combination of

786
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:20,959
i was actually doing a combination of
 

787
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,190
i was actually doing a combination of
mri and ultrasound and looking at a

788
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:23,200
mri and ultrasound and looking at a
 

789
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,870
mri and ultrasound and looking at a
phenomena called elastography which is

790
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:24,880
phenomena called elastography which is
 

791
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,870
phenomena called elastography which is
you push waves into the body

792
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:26,880
you push waves into the body
 

793
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,790
you push waves into the body
and observe those waves like you can

794
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:28,800
and observe those waves like you can
 

795
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,150
and observe those waves like you can
actually measure them

796
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,160
actually measure them
 

797
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,430
actually measure them
and then you

798
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:31,440
and then you
 

799
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,030
and then you
do mathematical inversion to see what

800
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,040
do mathematical inversion to see what
 

801
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,670
do mathematical inversion to see what
the elasticity is and so that's the

802
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:35,680
the elasticity is and so that's the
 

803
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,269
the elasticity is and so that's the
problem i was solving is how to do that

804
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:37,279
problem i was solving is how to do that
 

805
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,150
problem i was solving is how to do that
with both ultrasound and mri i needed

806
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,160
with both ultrasound and mri i needed
 

807
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,509
with both ultrasound and mri i needed
some tool to do that with so i was

808
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:41,519
some tool to do that with so i was
 

809
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,030
some tool to do that with so i was
starting to use python in 1997 in 98 i

810
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,040
starting to use python in 1997 in 98 i
 

811
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,269
starting to use python in 1997 in 98 i
went back looked at what i'd written and

812
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:47,279
went back looked at what i'd written and
 

813
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,350
went back looked at what i'd written and
realized i could still understand it

814
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:49,360
realized i could still understand it
 

815
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,949
realized i could still understand it
which is not the experience i'd had when

816
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:50,959
which is not the experience i'd had when
 

817
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,310
which is not the experience i'd had when
doing pearl in 95. right i'd done the

818
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:54,320
doing pearl in 95. right i'd done the
 

819
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,990
doing pearl in 95. right i'd done the
same thing and then i looked back and i

820
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,000
same thing and then i looked back and i
 

821
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,150
same thing and then i looked back and i
forgotten what it was even saying

822
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,160
forgotten what it was even saying
 

823
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,150
forgotten what it was even saying
now you know i'm not saying it so i that

824
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,160
now you know i'm not saying it so i that
 

825
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,230
now you know i'm not saying it so i that
that means hey this may work i like this

826
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:02,240
that means hey this may work i like this
 

827
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,829
that means hey this may work i like this
this is something i can

828
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:03,839
this is something i can
 

829
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,430
this is something i can
retain without becoming an expert per se

830
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:07,440
retain without becoming an expert per se
 

831
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,189
retain without becoming an expert per se
and so that led me to go i'm going to

832
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:09,199
and so that led me to go i'm going to
 

833
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,269
and so that led me to go i'm going to
push more into this and

834
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:11,279
push more into this and
 

835
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,389
push more into this and
then that 98 was kind of the when i

836
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:14,399
then that 98 was kind of the when i
 

837
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,829
then that 98 was kind of the when i
started to fall in love with python i

838
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:15,839
started to fall in love with python i
 

839
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,069
started to fall in love with python i
would say

840
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:18,079
would say
 

841
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,590
would say
a few peculiar things about python so

842
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:21,600
a few peculiar things about python so
 

843
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,350
a few peculiar things about python so
maybe compared to pearl compared to some

844
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:23,360
maybe compared to pearl compared to some
 

845
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,189
maybe compared to pearl compared to some
of the other languages so there's no

846
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:25,199
of the other languages so there's no
 

847
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,030
of the other languages so there's no
braces yeah

848
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,040
braces yeah
 

849
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,470
braces yeah
so you

850
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:28,480
so you
 

851
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,910
so you
space is used indentation i should say

852
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:31,920
space is used indentation i should say
 

853
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,550
space is used indentation i should say
is used as part of my language yeah

854
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:34,560
is used as part of my language yeah
 

855
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,470
is used as part of my language yeah
right uh so

856
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:36,480
right uh so
 

857
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,670
right uh so
did you

858
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:37,680
did you
 

859
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,069
did you
i mean that that's quite a leap uh were

860
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:40,079
i mean that that's quite a leap uh were
 

861
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,269
i mean that that's quite a leap uh were
you comfortable with that leap or were

862
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:41,279
you comfortable with that leap or were
 

863
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,269
you comfortable with that leap or were
you just very open-minded good question

864
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:43,279
you just very open-minded good question
 

865
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,150
you just very open-minded good question
i was open-minded so it i was

866
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,160
i was open-minded so it i was
 

867
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,150
i was open-minded so it i was
cognizant of the concern and it

868
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,160
cognizant of the concern and it
 

869
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,590
cognizant of the concern and it
definitely has

870
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:49,600
definitely has
 

871
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,189
definitely has
it has specific

872
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:51,199
it has specific
 

873
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,509
it has specific
challenges you know cut and pasting for

874
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:53,519
challenges you know cut and pasting for
 

875
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,509
challenges you know cut and pasting for
example you're cutting pasting code and

876
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:55,519
example you're cutting pasting code and
 

877
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,870
example you're cutting pasting code and
if your editors aren't supportive of

878
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:56,880
if your editors aren't supportive of
 

879
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,870
if your editors aren't supportive of
that if you're put into a terminal

880
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:58,880
that if you're put into a terminal
 

881
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,150
that if you're put into a terminal
and particularly in the past when

882
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,160
and particularly in the past when
 

883
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,829
and particularly in the past when
terminals didn't necessarily have the

884
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:01,839
terminals didn't necessarily have the
 

885
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,670
terminals didn't necessarily have the
intelligence to manage it now now now

886
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:03,680
intelligence to manage it now now now
 

887
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,430
intelligence to manage it now now now
ipython and jupyter notebooks handle it

888
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:05,440
ipython and jupyter notebooks handle it
 

889
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,710
ipython and jupyter notebooks handle it
just fine so there's really no problem

890
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:06,720
just fine so there's really no problem
 

891
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,069
just fine so there's really no problem
but in the past it created some

892
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:08,079
but in the past it created some
 

893
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,710
but in the past it created some
challenges formatting challenges also

894
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:10,720
challenges formatting challenges also
 

895
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,870
challenges formatting challenges also
mixed tabs and spaces if you're if

896
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:12,880
mixed tabs and spaces if you're if
 

897
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,710
mixed tabs and spaces if you're if
editors weren't you weren't clear on

898
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:14,720
editors weren't you weren't clear on
 

899
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,150
editors weren't you weren't clear on
what was happening you would have these

900
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,160
what was happening you would have these
 

901
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,750
what was happening you would have these
issues so there were really concrete

902
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:17,760
issues so there were really concrete
 

903
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,750
issues so there were really concrete
reasons about it that i heard and

904
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:19,760
reasons about it that i heard and
 

905
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,670
reasons about it that i heard and
understood i never really encountered a

906
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:21,680
understood i never really encountered a
 

907
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,269
understood i never really encountered a
problem with it

908
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:23,279
problem with it
 

909
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,590
problem with it
personally like it was occasional

910
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:25,600
personally like it was occasional
 

911
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,189
personally like it was occasional
annoyances but

912
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:27,199
annoyances but
 

913
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,629
annoyances but
i really like the fact that it didn't

914
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:28,639
i really like the fact that it didn't
 

915
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,949
i really like the fact that it didn't
have all this extra characters right

916
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:30,959
have all this extra characters right
 

917
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:31,670
have all this extra characters right
that

918
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:31,680
that
 

919
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,189
that
these extra characters didn't show up in

920
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:33,199
these extra characters didn't show up in
 

921
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,269
these extra characters didn't show up in
my visual field when i was just trying

922
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:35,279
my visual field when i was just trying
 

923
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,350
my visual field when i was just trying
to process understanding a snippet of

924
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:37,360
to process understanding a snippet of
 

925
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,350
to process understanding a snippet of
code yeah there's a cleanness to it but

926
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:39,360
code yeah there's a cleanness to it but
 

927
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,269
code yeah there's a cleanness to it but
i mean the idea is supposed to be that

928
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:41,279
i mean the idea is supposed to be that
 

929
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,430
i mean the idea is supposed to be that
pearl also has a cleanness to it because

930
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:43,440
pearl also has a cleanness to it because
 

931
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,910
pearl also has a cleanness to it because
of the minimalism of like how many

932
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:45,920
of the minimalism of like how many
 

933
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,670
of the minimalism of like how many
characters it takes to express a certain

934
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:47,680
characters it takes to express a certain
 

935
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,829
characters it takes to express a certain
thing yeah so it's very compact yeah but

936
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:49,839
thing yeah so it's very compact yeah but
 

937
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,509
thing yeah so it's very compact yeah but
what you realize with that compactness

938
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:51,519
what you realize with that compactness
 

939
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,430
what you realize with that compactness
comes

940
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:53,440
comes
 

941
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,990
comes
there's a culture that uh prizes

942
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,000
there's a culture that uh prizes
 

943
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,069
there's a culture that uh prizes
compactness and so the code gets more

944
00:15:58,069 --> 00:15:58,079
compactness and so the code gets more
 

945
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,350
compactness and so the code gets more
and more compact and less and less

946
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,360
and more compact and less and less
 

947
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,710
and more compact and less and less
readable to a point where it's like

948
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:02,720
readable to a point where it's like
 

949
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,269
readable to a point where it's like
uh like to be a good programmer in pearl

950
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:05,279
uh like to be a good programmer in pearl
 

951
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,550
uh like to be a good programmer in pearl
you write code that's basically

952
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:06,560
you write code that's basically
 

953
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,030
you write code that's basically
unreadable right there's a culture like

954
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,040
unreadable right there's a culture like
 

955
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,949
unreadable right there's a culture like
correct and you're proud of it yeah

956
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:10,959
correct and you're proud of it yeah
 

957
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,389
correct and you're proud of it yeah
you're proud of it

958
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:12,399
you're proud of it
 

959
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,069
you're proud of it
right exactly and it's like feels good

960
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:14,079
right exactly and it's like feels good
 

961
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,949
right exactly and it's like feels good
and it's really selective like it means

962
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:16,959
and it's really selective like it means
 

963
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,350
and it's really selective like it means
you have to be an expert in perl to

964
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:19,360
you have to be an expert in perl to
 

965
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,269
you have to be an expert in perl to
understand it yeah whereas python was

966
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:21,279
understand it yeah whereas python was
 

967
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,870
understand it yeah whereas python was
allowed you not to have to be an expert

968
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:22,880
allowed you not to have to be an expert
 

969
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,629
allowed you not to have to be an expert
you'd have to take all this brain energy

970
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:24,639
you'd have to take all this brain energy
 

971
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,749
you'd have to take all this brain energy
you could leverage what i said you could

972
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:25,759
you could leverage what i said you could
 

973
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,069
you could leverage what i said you could
leverage your english language center

974
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:28,079
leverage your english language center
 

975
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,990
leverage your english language center
which you're using all the time i've

976
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,000
which you're using all the time i've
 

977
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,030
which you're using all the time i've
wondered about other languages

978
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,040
wondered about other languages
 

979
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,030
wondered about other languages
particularly non-uh latin based

980
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,040
particularly non-uh latin based
 

981
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,629
particularly non-uh latin based
languages you know

982
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:34,639
languages you know
 

983
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,749
languages you know
latin-based languages where the

984
00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:35,759
latin-based languages where the
 

985
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,350
latin-based languages where the
characters are at least similar i think

986
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:37,360
characters are at least similar i think
 

987
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,110
characters are at least similar i think
people have an easier time but i don't

988
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,120
people have an easier time but i don't
 

989
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,269
people have an easier time but i don't
know what it's like to be a japanese or

990
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:41,279
know what it's like to be a japanese or
 

991
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,749
know what it's like to be a japanese or
a chinese person trying to

992
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:43,759
a chinese person trying to
 

993
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,910
a chinese person trying to
learn a different um

00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920
learn a different um
 

995
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,110
learn a different um
different syntax like what would

996
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:47,120
different syntax like what would
 

997
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,269
different syntax like what would
computer programming look like in a in

998
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:49,279
computer programming look like in a in
 

999
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,949
computer programming look like in a in
that i haven't looked at that at all but

1000
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:50,959
that i haven't looked at that at all but
 

1001
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,470
that i haven't looked at that at all but
it certainly doesn't you know leveraging

1002
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
it certainly doesn't you know leveraging
 

1003
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,230
it certainly doesn't you know leveraging
your your chinese language center i'm

1004
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:54,240
your your chinese language center i'm
 

1005
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,069
your your chinese language center i'm
not sure python or any programming does

1006
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:56,079
not sure python or any programming does
 

1007
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:56,790
not sure python or any programming does
that

1008
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:56,800
that
 

1009
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,389
that
but that was a big deal the fact that it

1010
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:58,399
but that was a big deal the fact that it
 

1011
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,069
but that was a big deal the fact that it
was accessible i could be a scientist

1012
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:00,079
was accessible i could be a scientist
 

1013
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,749
was accessible i could be a scientist
what i really liked is

1014
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:01,759
what i really liked is
 

1015
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,269
what i really liked is
many programming languages really demand

1016
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:03,279
many programming languages really demand
 

1017
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,630
many programming languages really demand
a lot of you and you can get a lot you

1018
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:04,640
a lot of you and you can get a lot you
 

1019
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,189
a lot of you and you can get a lot you
know you do a lot if you learn it but

1020
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:07,199
know you do a lot if you learn it but
 

1021
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,949
know you do a lot if you learn it but
python enables you to do a lot without

1022
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:08,959
python enables you to do a lot without
 

1023
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,110
python enables you to do a lot without
demanding a lot of you

1024
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,120
demanding a lot of you
 

1025
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,470
demanding a lot of you
there's a there's nuance to that

1026
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:12,480
there's a there's nuance to that
 

1027
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,630
there's a there's nuance to that
statement but it certainly was it's more

1028
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:14,640
statement but it certainly was it's more
 

1029
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,549
statement but it certainly was it's more
accessible so more people could actually

1030
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:16,559
accessible so more people could actually
 

1031
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,630
accessible so more people could actually
as a as a scientist as somebody or

1032
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:18,640
as a as a scientist as somebody or
 

1033
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,669
as a as a scientist as somebody or
engineer

1034
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:19,679

who was trying to solve another problem

1036
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:21,280
who was trying to solve another problem
 

1037
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,590
who was trying to solve another problem
besides point programming i could still

1038
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:23,600
besides point programming i could still
 

1039
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,829
besides point programming i could still
use this language and get things done

1040
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:25,839
use this language and get things done
 

1041
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,669
use this language and get things done
and and be happy about it i was also

1042
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:27,679
and and be happy about it i was also
 

1043
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:28,950
and and be happy about it i was also
comfortable in c

1044
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:28,960
comfortable in c
 

1045
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,190
comfortable in c
at that time and matlab you did a little

1046
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:31,200
at that time and matlab you did a little
 

1047
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,029
at that time and matlab you did a little
matlab i did a lot before that exactly

1048
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:33,039
matlab i did a lot before that exactly
 

1049
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,789
matlab i did a lot before that exactly
so i was comfortable in

1050
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:34,799
so i was comfortable in
 

1051
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,390
so i was comfortable in
those three languages were really the

1052
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:36,400
those three languages were really the
 

1053
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,710
those three languages were really the
tools i used during my studies and

1054
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:38,720
tools i used during my studies and
 

1055
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,990
tools i used during my studies and
schooling

1056
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:40,000
schooling
 

1057
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,669
schooling
um but to your point about language

1058
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:41,679
um but to your point about language
 

1059
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,270
um but to your point about language
helping you think one of the big things

1060
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:43,280
helping you think one of the big things
 

1061
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,070
helping you think one of the big things
about matlab is it was and apl before it

1062
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,080
about matlab is it was and apl before it
 

1063
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,110
about matlab is it was and apl before it
i don't know if you're a you remember

1064
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,120
i don't know if you're a you remember
 

1065
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,150
i don't know if you're a you remember
apl

1066
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:48,160
apl
 

1067
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,150
apl
apl is uh actually the predecessor of

1068
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:50,160
apl is uh actually the predecessor of
 

1069
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,230
apl is uh actually the predecessor of
array-based programming which i think is

1070
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:52,240
array-based programming which i think is
 

1071
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,909
array-based programming which i think is
really an underappreciated

1072
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:53,919
really an underappreciated
 

1073
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,190
really an underappreciated
if i talk to people who are just steeped

1074
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,200
if i talk to people who are just steeped
 

1075
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,430
if i talk to people who are just steeped
in computer programming computer science

1076
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:57,440
in computer programming computer science
 

1077
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,029
in computer programming computer science
like most the people that microsoft has

1078
00:17:59,029 --> 00:17:59,039
like most the people that microsoft has
 

1079
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,950
like most the people that microsoft has
hired in the past for example

1080
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:00,960
hired in the past for example
 

1081
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,270
hired in the past for example
microsoft as a company generally did not

1082
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,280
microsoft as a company generally did not
 

1083
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,270
microsoft as a company generally did not
understand array-based programming like

1084
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,280
understand array-based programming like
 

1085
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,630
understand array-based programming like
culturally they didn't understand it so

1086
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:06,640
culturally they didn't understand it so
 

1087
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,029
culturally they didn't understand it so
they kept missing the boat kept missing

1088
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:09,039
they kept missing the boat kept missing
 

1089
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,470
they kept missing the boat kept missing
the understanding of what this what this

1090
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:10,480
the understanding of what this what this
 

1091
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,430
the understanding of what this what this
was

1092
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:11,440
was
 

1093
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,110
was
they've gotten better but there's still

1094
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,120
they've gotten better but there's still
 

1095
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,110
they've gotten better but there's still
a whole culture of folks that doesn't

1096
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,120
a whole culture of folks that doesn't
 

1097
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,470
a whole culture of folks that doesn't
programming that's yeah you know that's

1098
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:16,480
programming that's yeah you know that's
 

1099
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,230
programming that's yeah you know that's
that's systems programming or web

1100
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:18,240
that's systems programming or web
 

1101
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,870
that's systems programming or web
programming or lists and maps and you

1102
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:20,880
programming or lists and maps and you
 

1103
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,390
programming or lists and maps and you
know what about an n-dimensional array

1104
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:22,400
know what about an n-dimensional array
 

1105
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,909
know what about an n-dimensional array
oh yeah that's just an implementation

1106
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:23,919
oh yeah that's just an implementation
 

1107
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,750
oh yeah that's just an implementation
detail well

1108
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:25,760
detail well
 

1109
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,350
detail well
you can think that but then actually if

1110
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:27,360
you can think that but then actually if
 

1111
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,710
you can think that but then actually if
you have that as a construct you

1112
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:28,720
you have that as a construct you
 

1113
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,390
you have that as a construct you
actually think differently apl was the

1114
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:30,400
actually think differently apl was the
 

1115
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,750
actually think differently apl was the
first language to understand that it was

1116
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:31,760
first language to understand that it was
 

1117
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,950
first language to understand that it was
in the 60s

1118
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:32,960
in the 60s
 

1119
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,510
in the 60s
right the challenge of apl is apl had

1120
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:35,520
right the challenge of apl is apl had
 

1121
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,230
right the challenge of apl is apl had
very dense not only glyphs like new

1122
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:38,240
very dense not only glyphs like new
 

1123
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,669
very dense not only glyphs like new
characters new glyphs they even had a

1124
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:39,679
characters new glyphs they even had a
 

1125
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,430
characters new glyphs they even had a
new keyboard because to produce those

1126
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:41,440
new keyboard because to produce those
 

1127
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,430
new keyboard because to produce those
glyphs this is back in the early days of

1128
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:43,440
glyphs this is back in the early days of
 

1129
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,909
glyphs this is back in the early days of
computing when you know the

1130
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:45,919
computing when you know the

query keyboard maybe wasn't as

1132
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:47,440
query keyboard maybe wasn't as
 

1133
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,789
query keyboard maybe wasn't as
established like what we could have a

1134
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:48,799
established like what we could have a
 

1135
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,630
established like what we could have a
new keyboard no big deal

1136
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:50,640
new keyboard no big deal
 

1137
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,150
new keyboard no big deal
but it was a big deal and it didn't

1138
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:52,160
but it was a big deal and it didn't
 

1139
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,430
but it was a big deal and it didn't
catch on and the language apl

00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:55,440
catch on and the language apl
 

1141
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,789
catch on and the language apl
very much like pearl as people would

1142
00:18:56,789 --> 00:18:56,799
very much like pearl as people would
 

1143
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,549
very much like pearl as people would
pride themselves on how how much could

30 characters of apl apl has characters

1148
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:04,000
30 characters of apl apl has characters
 

1149
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,870
30 characters of apl apl has characters
that mean

1150
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:04,880
that mean
 

1151
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,830
that mean
uh summation and uh they have adverbs

1152
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:07,840
uh summation and uh they have adverbs
 

1153
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,029
uh summation and uh they have adverbs
you know they have adjectives and these

1154
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:09,039
you know they have adjectives and these
 

1155
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,630
you know they have adjectives and these
things called adverbs which are like

1156
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:10,640
things called adverbs which are like
 

1157
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,549
things called adverbs which are like
methods like reduction reduction it

1158
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:12,559
methods like reduction reduction it
 

1159
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,950
methods like reduction reduction it
would be an adverb on an ad operator

1160
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:14,960
would be an adverb on an ad operator
 

1161
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,150
would be an adverb on an ad operator
right so

1162
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:16,160
right so
 

1163
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,909
right so
but doing using these tools you could

1164
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:17,919
but doing using these tools you could
 

1165
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,830
but doing using these tools you could
construct and then you start to think at

1166
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:19,840
construct and then you start to think at
 

1167
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,830
construct and then you start to think at
that level you think in end dimensions

1168
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:21,840
that level you think in end dimensions
 

1169
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,950
that level you think in end dimensions
it's something i like to say and you

1170
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:22,960
it's something i like to say and you
 

1171
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,549
it's something i like to say and you
start to think differently about data at

1172
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:24,559
start to think differently about data at
 

1173
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,310
start to think differently about data at
that point you know now you're

1174
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:26,320
that point you know now you're
 

1175
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,630
that point you know now you're
it really helps yeah i mean

1176
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:28,640
it really helps yeah i mean
 

1177
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,470
it really helps yeah i mean
outside of programming if you really

1178
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:30,480
outside of programming if you really
 

1179
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,590
outside of programming if you really
internalize linear algebra as a course

1180
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:33,600
internalize linear algebra as a course
 

1181
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,590
internalize linear algebra as a course
i mean it philosophically allows you to

1182
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:35,600
i mean it philosophically allows you to
 

1183
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,270
i mean it philosophically allows you to
think of the world differently yes it's

1184
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:37,280
think of the world differently yes it's
 

1185
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,510
think of the world differently yes it's
almost like liberating you don't have to

1187
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,789
almost like liberating you don't have to
you don't have to think about the

1188
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:40,799
you don't have to think about the
 

1189
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,590
you don't have to think about the
individual numbers in the n-dimensional

1190
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:43,600
individual numbers in the n-dimensional
 

1191
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,510
individual numbers in the n-dimensional
array you can think of it as an object

1192
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:45,520

can open up

1196
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:48,400
can open up
 

1197
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,870
can open up
now you're saying matlab and apl were

1198
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:50,880
now you're saying matlab and apl were
 

1199
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,470
now you're saying matlab and apl were
like the early c

1200
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:52,480
like the early c
 

1201
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,230
like the early c
i don't know if many languages got that

did is not have the glyphs just have
 

1215
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,230
did is not have the glyphs just have
short characters but still a latin

00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:21,919
language like rank is a concept that's
 

1227
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,350
language like rank is a concept that's
in that was in python it's still in

00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:23,360
in that was in python it's still in

for the number of dimensions right
 

1233
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,470
for the number of dimensions right
that's that's different than say the

1234
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:28,480
that's that's different than say the
 

1235
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,549
that's that's different than say the
rank of a matrix which people think of

1236
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:30,559
rank of a matrix which people think of
 

1237
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,549
rank of a matrix which people think of
as well so it's it came from that

1238
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:32,559
as well so it's it came from that
 

1239
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,710
as well so it's it came from that
tradition but numpy

1240
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:34,720
tradition but numpy
 

1241
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,830
tradition but numpy
is a very pragmatic practical tool uh

1242
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:37,840
is a very pragmatic practical tool uh
 

1243
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,430
is a very pragmatic practical tool uh
numpy inherited from numeric and we can

1244
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:39,440
numpy inherited from numeric and we can
 

1245
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,950
numpy inherited from numeric and we can
get to where numpy came from which is

1246
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:40,960
get to where numpy came from which is
 

1247
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,110
get to where numpy came from which is
the current array

1248
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,120
the current array
 

1249
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,909
the current array
at least current as of

00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:44,919
at least current as of
 

1251
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:47,669
at least current as of
2016-17 now there's a ton of them over

1252
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:47,679
2016-17 now there's a ton of them over
 

1253
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,430
2016-17 now there's a ton of them over
the past two or three years but we can

1254
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:49,440
the past two or three years but we can
 

1255
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,350
the past two or three years but we can
get into that too so if we just sort of

1256
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:51,360
get into that too so if we just sort of
 

1257
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,510
get into that too so if we just sort of
linger on the early days of

00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:53,520
linger on the early days of

1260
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,080
what was your favorite feature of python
 

1261
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,070
what was your favorite feature of python
do you remember like what yeah

1262
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,080
do you remember like what yeah
 

1263
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,669
do you remember like what yeah
it's so interesting

1264
00:20:59,669 --> 00:20:59,679
it's so interesting
 

1265
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,390
it's so interesting
to linger on like the

1266
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,400
to linger on like the
 

1267
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,510
to linger on like the
what

1268
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:03,520
what
 

1269
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,669
what
what really makes you connect with the

1270
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:05,679
what really makes you connect with the
 

1271
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,669
what really makes you connect with the
language i'm not sure it's

1272
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:07,679
language i'm not sure it's
 

1273
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,909
language i'm not sure it's
obvious to introspect that no it isn't

1274
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:09,919
obvious to introspect that no it isn't
 

1275
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,750
obvious to introspect that no it isn't
and i've thought about that at some

1276
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:11,760
and i've thought about that at some
 

1277
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,230
and i've thought about that at some
length i'm not i think definitely the

1278
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:14,240
length i'm not i think definitely the
 

1279
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,310
length i'm not i think definitely the
fact that i could read it later yeah

1280
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:16,320
fact that i could read it later yeah
 

1281
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,230
fact that i could read it later yeah
that i could use it productively without

1282
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,240
that i could use it productively without
 

1283
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,830
that i could use it productively without
becoming an expert and the other

1284
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:19,840
becoming an expert and the other
 

1285
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,350
becoming an expert and the other
language i had to put more effort into

00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,360
language i had to put more effort into
 

1287
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,070
language i had to put more effort into
right

1288
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,080
right
 

1289
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,830
right
that's like an empirical observation

1290
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:23,840
that's like an empirical observation
 

1291
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,830
that's like an empirical observation
like you're not analyzing any one aspect

1292
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:25,840
like you're not analyzing any one aspect
 

1293
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,510
like you're not analyzing any one aspect
of the language it just seems

1294
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:27,520
of the language it just seems
 

1295
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,510
of the language it just seems
time after time you look back it's

1296
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:29,520
time after time you look back it's
 

1297
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,110
time after time you look back it's
somehow readable it's somewhat readable

1298
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:31,120
somehow readable it's somewhat readable
 

1299
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,510
somehow readable it's somewhat readable
then it was sort of i could take

1300
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:33,520
then it was sort of i could take
 

1301
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,750
then it was sort of i could take
uh executable english yeah and translate

1302
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:35,760
uh executable english yeah and translate
 

1303
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,029
uh executable english yeah and translate
it to python more easily like i didn't

1304
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:37,039
it to python more easily like i didn't
 

1305
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,470
it to python more easily like i didn't
have to go there was no translation

1306
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:38,480
have to go there was no translation
 

1307
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,590
have to go there was no translation
layer

1308
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:39,600
layer
 

1309
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,669
layer
as an engineer or as a scientist i could

1310
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:41,679
as an engineer or as a scientist i could
 

1311
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,270
as an engineer or as a scientist i could
think about what i wanted to do and then

1312
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:43,280
think about what i wanted to do and then
 

1313
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,750
think about what i wanted to do and then
the syntax wasn't that far behind it

1314
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:45,760
the syntax wasn't that far behind it
 

1315
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,430
the syntax wasn't that far behind it
yeah right now there was some there have

1316
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:47,440
yeah right now there was some there have
 

1317
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,190
yeah right now there was some there have
some there's some warts there still it

1318
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:49,200
some there's some warts there still it
 

1319
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,029
some there's some warts there still it
wasn't perfect like there's some areas

1320
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:51,039
wasn't perfect like there's some areas
 

1321
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,149
wasn't perfect like there's some areas
where i'm like ah it'd be better if this

1322
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:52,159
where i'm like ah it'd be better if this
 

1323
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,310
where i'm like ah it'd be better if this
were different or if this were different

1324
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:54,320
were different or if this were different
 

1325
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,909
were different or if this were different
some of those things got out of the

1326
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:55,919
some of those things got out of the
 

1327
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,350
some of those things got out of the
language too i was really grateful for

1328
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:57,360
language too i was really grateful for
 

1329
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,870
language too i was really grateful for
some of the early pioneers in the python

1330
00:21:58,870 --> 00:21:58,880
some of the early pioneers in the python
 

1331
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,789
some of the early pioneers in the python
ecosystem back because python got

1332
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:00,799
ecosystem back because python got
 

1333
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,549
ecosystem back because python got
written in 91 is when the first version

1334
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:02,559
written in 91 is when the first version
 

1335
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,510
written in 91 is when the first version
came out but guido was very open to

1336
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:05,520
came out but guido was very open to
 

1337
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,590
came out but guido was very open to
users and one of the sets of users were

1338
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:07,600
users and one of the sets of users were
 

1339
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,830
users and one of the sets of users were
people like jim hugin and david asher

1340
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:09,840
people like jim hugin and david asher
 

1341
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,190
people like jim hugin and david asher
and paul dubois

1342
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:11,200
and paul dubois
 

1343
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,990
and paul dubois
and

1344
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:12,000
and
 

1345
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,909
and
conrad hinson these were people that

1346
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:13,919
conrad hinson these were people that
 

1347
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,830
conrad hinson these were people that
were on the main list and they were just

1348
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:15,840
were on the main list and they were just
 

1349
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,190
were on the main list and they were just
asking for things like hey we really

1350
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:17,200
asking for things like hey we really
 

1351
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,470
asking for things like hey we really
should have complex numbers in this

1352
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:18,480
should have complex numbers in this
 

1353
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,350
should have complex numbers in this
language so let's you know there's a j

1354
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:21,360
language so let's you know there's a j
 

1355
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,110
language so let's you know there's a j
there's a one j right and the fact they

1356
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,120
there's a one j right and the fact they
 

1357
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,390
there's a one j right and the fact they
want the engineering root of j is

1358
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:24,400
want the engineering root of j is
 

1359
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,590
want the engineering root of j is
interesting

1360
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:25,600
interesting
 

1361
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,830
interesting
i don't i don't think that's entirely

1362
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:27,840
i don't i don't think that's entirely
 

1363
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,110
i don't i don't think that's entirely
favorite engineers i think it's because

1364
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,120
favorite engineers i think it's because
 

1365
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,430
favorite engineers i think it's because
i is so often used as the index of a for

1366
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:31,440
i is so often used as the index of a for
 

1367
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,549
i is so often used as the index of a for
loop

1368
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:32,559
loop
 

1369
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,149
loop
so i think that's actually

1370
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:34,159
so i think that's actually
 

1371
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,750
so i think that's actually
probably right i mean there's there's a

1372
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:35,760
probably right i mean there's there's a
 

1373
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,430
probably right i mean there's there's a
pragmatic aspect like the complex

1374
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:37,440
pragmatic aspect like the complex
 

1375
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,270
pragmatic aspect like the complex
numbers were there i love that the fact

1376
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:39,280
numbers were there i love that the fact
 

1377
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,270
numbers were there i love that the fact
that i could write nd arrays constructs

1378
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:41,280
that i could write nd arrays constructs
 

1379
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,270
that i could write nd arrays constructs
and that reduction was there very simple

1380
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:43,280
and that reduction was there very simple
 

1381
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,510
and that reduction was there very simple
to write summations and and and

1382
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:45,520
to write summations and and and
 

1383
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,870
to write summations and and and
broadcasting was there i could do

1384
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:46,880
broadcasting was there i could do
 

1385
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,630
broadcasting was there i could do
addition of whole arrays

1386
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:48,640
addition of whole arrays
 

1387
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,710
addition of whole arrays
um so that was cool those were something

1388
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:50,720
um so that was cool those were something
 

1389
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,470
um so that was cool those were something
i loved about it

1390
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:52,480
i loved about it
 

1391
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,310
i loved about it
i don't know what to start talking to

1392
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:54,320
i don't know what to start talking to
 

1393
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,830
i don't know what to start talking to
you about because you've been you've

1394
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:55,840
you about because you've been you've
 

1395
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,830
you about because you've been you've
created so many incredible projects that

1396
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:57,840
created so many incredible projects that
 

1397
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,590
created so many incredible projects that
basically changed the whole landscape of

1398
00:22:59,590 --> 00:22:59,600
basically changed the whole landscape of
 

1399
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,230
basically changed the whole landscape of
programming but okay let's start with uh

1400
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:02,240
programming but okay let's start with uh
 

1401
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,149
programming but okay let's start with uh
let's go chronologically

1402
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:04,159
let's go chronologically
 

1403
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,590
let's go chronologically
with scipy you create a scipy over two

1404
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:07,600
with scipy you create a scipy over two
 

1405
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,909
with scipy you create a scipy over two
decades ago now yes right yeah i said

1406
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:09,919
decades ago now yes right yeah i said
 

1407
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,350
decades ago now yes right yeah i said
i'd love to talk about sci-fi sci-fi was

1408
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:11,360
i'd love to talk about sci-fi sci-fi was
 

1409
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,870
i'd love to talk about sci-fi sci-fi was
really my baby

1410
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:12,880
really my baby
 

1411
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,070
really my baby
what is it

1412
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,080
what is it
 

1413
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,230
what is it
uh what was its goal what is its goal

1414
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:16,240
uh what was its goal what is its goal
 

1415
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,029
uh what was its goal what is its goal
how does it work yeah fantastic so scipy

1416
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:19,039
how does it work yeah fantastic so scipy
 

1417
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,590
how does it work yeah fantastic so scipy
was effectively here i'm using python to

1418
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:21,600
was effectively here i'm using python to
 

1419
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,390
was effectively here i'm using python to
do

1420
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:22,400
do
 

1421
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,310
do
stuff that i previously used matlab to

1422
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:24,320
stuff that i previously used matlab to
 

1423
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,149
stuff that i previously used matlab to
use and i was using numeric which is an

1424
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:26,159
use and i was using numeric which is an
 

1425
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,270
use and i was using numeric which is an
array library that made a lot of it

1426
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:27,280
array library that made a lot of it
 

1427
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,270
array library that made a lot of it
possible but there's things that were

1428
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:29,280
possible but there's things that were
 

1429
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,950
possible but there's things that were
missing like i didn't have an ordinary

1430
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:30,960
missing like i didn't have an ordinary
 

1431
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,149
missing like i didn't have an ordinary
differential equation solver i could

1432
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:32,159
differential equation solver i could
 

1433
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,310
differential equation solver i could
just call right i didn't have

1434
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:34,320
just call right i didn't have
 

1435
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,470
just call right i didn't have
integration hey i wanted to integrate

1436
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:36,480
integration hey i wanted to integrate
 

1437
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,909
integration hey i wanted to integrate
this function okay well i don't have

1438
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:37,919
this function okay well i don't have
 

1439
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,070
this function okay well i don't have
just a function i can call to do that

1440
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:40,080
just a function i can call to do that
 

1441
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,750
just a function i can call to do that
um these are things i remember being

1442
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:41,760
um these are things i remember being
 

1443
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,590
um these are things i remember being
critical things that i was missing

1444
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:43,600

optimization i just want to pass a

1446
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:45,279
optimization i just want to pass a
 

1447
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,430
optimization i just want to pass a
function to an optimizer and have it

1448
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:47,440
function to an optimizer and have it
 

1449
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,350
function to an optimizer and have it
tell me what the optimum value is

1450
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:49,360
tell me what the optimum value is
 

1451
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,269
tell me what the optimum value is
uh those are things like well why don't

1452
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:51,279
uh those are things like well why don't
 

1453
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,190
uh those are things like well why don't

99 98 was when i first started to write

1504
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:35,039
99 98 was when i first started to write
 

1505
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,950
99 98 was when i first started to write
libraries for python particularly when i

1506
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:36,960
libraries for python particularly when i
 

1507
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,390
libraries for python particularly when i
fell in love with python 98 i thought

1508
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:38,400
fell in love with python 98 i thought
 

1509
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,590
fell in love with python 98 i thought
well there's just a few things missing

1510
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:39,600
well there's just a few things missing
 

1511
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,990
well there's just a few things missing
like oh i need a reader to read dicom

1512
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,000
like oh i need a reader to read dicom

files i was in medical imaging.com was a

1514
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,080
files i was in medical imaging.com was a
 

1515
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,590
files i was in medical imaging.com was a
format that i want to be able to load

1516
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:45,600
format that i want to be able to load
 

1517
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,510
format that i want to be able to load
that into python okay how do i write a

1518
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:47,520
that into python okay how do i write a
 

1519
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,950
that into python okay how do i write a
reader for that so i wrote something

1520
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:48,960
reader for that so i wrote something
 

1521
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,750
reader for that so i wrote something
called

1522
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:49,760
called
 

1523
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,390
called
it was an i o package right and that was

1524
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:52,400
it was an i o package right and that was
 

1525
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,710
it was an i o package right and that was
my very first extension module which is

1526
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:54,720
my very first extension module which is
 

1527
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,029
my very first extension module which is
c so i wrote c code to extend python so

1528
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:57,039
c so i wrote c code to extend python so
 

1529
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,390
c so i wrote c code to extend python so
that the pos in python i could write

1530
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:58,400
that the pos in python i could write
 

1531
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,950
that the pos in python i could write
things more easily that that combination

1532
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:00,960
things more easily that that combination
 

1533
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,029
things more easily that that combination
kind of hooked me it was the idea that i

1534
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:03,039
kind of hooked me it was the idea that i
 

1535
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,470
kind of hooked me it was the idea that i
could here's this powerful tool i can

1536
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:04,480
could here's this powerful tool i can
 

1537
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,909
could here's this powerful tool i can
use as a scripting language and a high

1538
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:05,919
use as a scripting language and a high
 

1539
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,750
use as a scripting language and a high
level language to think about but that i

1540
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:07,760
level language to think about but that i
 

1541
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,830
level language to think about but that i
can extend easily

1542
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:09,840
can extend easily
 

1543
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,310
can extend easily
easily in c that easily for me because i

1544
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:12,320
easily in c that easily for me because i
 

1545
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,710
easily in c that easily for me because i
knew enough c right and then guido had

1546
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:14,720
knew enough c right and then guido had
 

1547
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,070
knew enough c right and then guido had
written a link i mean the only the hard

1548
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,080
written a link i mean the only the hard
 

1549
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,590
written a link i mean the only the hard
part of extending python was something

1550
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:17,600
part of extending python was something
 

1551
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,350
part of extending python was something
called the way memory management works

1552
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:19,360
called the way memory management works
 

1553
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,110
called the way memory management works
and you have to reference counting and

1554
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:21,120
and you have to reference counting and
 

1555
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,110
and you have to reference counting and
so there's there's a tracking of

1556
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,120
so there's there's a tracking of
 

1557
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,230
so there's there's a tracking of
reference counting you have to do

1558
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:24,240
reference counting you have to do
 

1559
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,350
reference counting you have to do
manually

1560
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:25,360
manually
 

1561
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,549
manually
and if you don't you have you have

1562
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:26,559
and if you don't you have you have
 

1563
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,110
and if you don't you have you have
memory leaks and uh so that's hard plus

1564
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,120
memory leaks and uh so that's hard plus
 

1565
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,029
memory leaks and uh so that's hard plus
then c you know it's just much more you

1566
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,039
then c you know it's just much more you
 

1567
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,390
then c you know it's just much more you
have to put more effort into it it's not

1568
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:32,400
have to put more effort into it it's not
 

1569
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,549
have to put more effort into it it's not
just i have to now think about pointers

1570
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:34,559
just i have to now think about pointers
 

1571
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,789
just i have to now think about pointers
and have to think about stuff that

1572
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:36,799
and have to think about stuff that
 

1573
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,230
and have to think about stuff that
is different i have to kind of you're

1574
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:38,240
is different i have to kind of you're
 

1575
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,990
is different i have to kind of you're
like putting a new cartridge in your

1576
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,000
like putting a new cartridge in your
 

1577
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,669
like putting a new cartridge in your
brain like you're okay i'm thinking

1578
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:41,679
brain like you're okay i'm thinking
 

1579
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,029
brain like you're okay i'm thinking
about mri now i'm thinking about

1580
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:43,039
about mri now i'm thinking about
 

1581
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,710
about mri now i'm thinking about
programming and there are distinct

1582
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:44,720
programming and there are distinct
 

1583
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,470
programming and there are distinct
modules you end up having to think about

1584
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:46,480
modules you end up having to think about
 

1585
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,070
modules you end up having to think about
so it's harder when i was just in python

1586
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:48,080
so it's harder when i was just in python
 

1587
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,590
so it's harder when i was just in python
i could just think about mri and

1588
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:49,600
i could just think about mri and
 

1589
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,350
i could just think about mri and
high-level writing

1590
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:51,360
high-level writing
 

1591
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,190
high-level writing
but i could do that and that kind of i

1592
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:53,200
but i could do that and that kind of i
 

1593
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,190
but i could do that and that kind of i
liked it i found that to be enjoyable

1594
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:55,200
liked it i found that to be enjoyable
 

1595
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,350
liked it i found that to be enjoyable
and fun and so i ended up oh well let me

1596
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:57,360
and fun and so i ended up oh well let me
 

1597
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,029
and fun and so i ended up oh well let me
just add a bunch of stuff to python to

1598
00:25:59,029 --> 00:25:59,039
just add a bunch of stuff to python to
 

1599
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,390
just add a bunch of stuff to python to

but okay can we just stand that because

1706
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:41,200
but okay can we just stand that because
 

1707
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,590
but okay can we just stand that because
that the community aspect of creating

that the community aspect of creating
 

1709
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,070
that the community aspect of creating
the package and sharing that yes

1710
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:46,080
the package and sharing that yes
 

1711
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,669
the package and sharing that yes
that's rare

1712
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:47,679
that's rare
 

1713
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,310
that's rare
that to have to both have

1714
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:50,320
that to have to both have
 

1715
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,830
that to have to both have
at that time so like that was pretty

1716
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:51,840
at that time so like that was pretty
 

1717
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,870
at that time so like that was pretty
early yeah so well not not rare maybe

1718
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:54,880
early yeah so well not not rare maybe
 

1719
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,350
early yeah so well not not rare maybe
maybe you can uh correct me on this but

1720
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:57,360
maybe you can uh correct me on this but
 

1721
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,029
maybe you can uh correct me on this but
it seems like in the scientific

1722
00:27:59,029 --> 00:27:59,039
it seems like in the scientific
 

1723
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,029
it seems like in the scientific
community so many people you were

1724
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:01,039
community so many people you were
 

1725
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,470
community so many people you were
basically solving the problems you

1726
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:02,480
basically solving the problems you
 

1727
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,990
basically solving the problems you
needed to solve

1728
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:04,000
needed to solve
 

1729
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,029
needed to solve
to process the particular application uh

1730
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:07,039
to process the particular application uh
 

1731
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,669
to process the particular application uh
the data that you need and

1732
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:09,679
the data that you need and
 

1733
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,669
the data that you need and
to also have the mind that i'm going to

1734
00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:11,679
to also have the mind that i'm going to
 

1735
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,909
to also have the mind that i'm going to
make this usable for others

1736
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:13,919
make this usable for others
 

1737
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,549

that's um i would say i was inspired i'd

1738
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:16,559
that's um i would say i was inspired i'd
 

1739
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,230
that's um i would say i was inspired i'd
been inspired by linux i've been

1740
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:18,240
been inspired by linux i've been
 

1741
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,710
been inspired by linux i've been
inspired by you know linus linus and him

1742
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:20,720
inspired by you know linus linus and him
 

1743
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,070
inspired by you know linus linus and him
making his code available and i was

1744
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,080
making his code available and i was
 

1745
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,269
making his code available and i was
starting to use linux at the time and i

1746
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:23,279
starting to use linux at the time and i
 

1747
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,110
starting to use linux at the time and i
went this is cool so i had kind of been

1748
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,120
went this is cool so i had kind of been
 

1749
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,669
went this is cool so i had kind of been
previously primed that way and generally

1750
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:27,679
previously primed that way and generally
 

1751
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,909

i was i was into science because i liked

00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:29,919
i was i was into science because i liked
 

1753
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,909
i was i was into science because i liked
the sharing notion i like the idea of

1754
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:31,919
the sharing notion i like the idea of
 

1755
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,830
the sharing notion i like the idea of
hey let's if collectively we build

1756
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:33,840
hey let's if collectively we build
 

1757
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,110
hey let's if collectively we build
knowledge and share it we can all be

1758
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,120
knowledge and share it we can all be
 

1759
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,870
knowledge and share it we can all be
better off okay so you weren't energized

1760
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:36,880
better off okay so you weren't energized
 

1761
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,870
better off okay so you weren't energized
by that so it's energized value already

1762
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:38,880
by that so it's energized value already
 

1763
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,870
by that so it's energized value already
yeah right and i can't deny that i was

1764
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:40,880
yeah right and i can't deny that i was
 

1765
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,789
yeah right and i can't deny that i was
i'm sort of uh had this very

1766
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:42,799
i'm sort of uh had this very
 

1767
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,190
i'm sort of uh had this very
i liked that part of science that part

1768
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:45,200
i liked that part of science that part
 

1769
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,310
i liked that part of science that part
of sharing and then all of a sudden oh

1770
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:46,320
of sharing and then all of a sudden oh
 

1771
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,909
of sharing and then all of a sudden oh
wait here's something and here's

1772
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:47,919
wait here's something and here's
 

1773
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,750
wait here's something and here's
something i could do

1774
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:49,760
something i could do
 

1775
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,750
something i could do
and then i slowly over years learned how

1776
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:51,760
and then i slowly over years learned how
 

1777
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,269
and then i slowly over years learned how
to share better so that you could

1778
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:53,279
to share better so that you could
 

1779
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,110
to share better so that you could
actually engage more people faster one

1780
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:55,120
actually engage more people faster one
 

1781
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,389
actually engage more people faster one
of the key things was actually giving

1782
00:28:56,389 --> 00:28:56,399
of the key things was actually giving
 

1783
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,470
of the key things was actually giving
people a binary they could install

1784
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:58,480
people a binary they could install
 

1785
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,070
people a binary they could install
right so that wasn't just your source

1786
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:00,080
right so that wasn't just your source
 

1787
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,350
right so that wasn't just your source
code good luck

1788

code good luck
 

1789
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,430
code good luck
compile this and then get it compiled

1790
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:03,440
compile this and then get it compiled
 

1791
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,590

you know it's really the key as to why

1800
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:14,399
you know it's really the key as to why

to get them to i'm have now the task of

1818
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:35,200
to get them to i'm have now the task of
 

1819
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,830
to get them to i'm have now the task of
teaching them how to do python enough

1820
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:37,840
teaching them how to do python enough
 

1821
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,830
teaching them how to do python enough
yeah to run the scripts and so i've been

1822
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:39,840
yeah to run the scripts and so i've been
 

1823
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,269
yeah to run the scripts and so i've been
actually facing this whether it's on the

1824
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:41,279
actually facing this whether it's on the
 

1825
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,190
actually facing this whether it's on the
condor some

1827
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,190
condor some
with the task of how do i minimally

1828
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:45,200
with the task of how do i minimally

explain basically to my mom how to write

1830
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:47,360
explain basically to my mom how to write
 

1831
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,870
explain basically to my mom how to write
a python script

1832
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:48,880
a python script
 

1833
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,029
a python script
and it's an interesting challenge

1834
00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:51,039
and it's an interesting challenge
 

1835
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,710
and it's an interesting challenge
it's a to-do item for me to figure out

1836
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:52,720
it's a to-do item for me to figure out
 

1837
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,710
it's a to-do item for me to figure out
like what is the minimal amount of

1838
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:54,720
like what is the minimal amount of
 

1839
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,630
like what is the minimal amount of
information i have to teach what are the

1840
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:56,640
information i have to teach what are the
 

1841
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,830
information i have to teach what are the
tools you use that one you enjoy it to

1842
00:29:59,830 --> 00:29:59,840
tools you use that one you enjoy it to
 

1843
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,750
tools you use that one you enjoy it to
your effect of it they're related to two

1844
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:01,760
your effect of it they're related to two
 

1845
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,669
your effect of it they're related to two
related questions and then the debugging

1846
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:03,679
related questions and then the debugging
 

1847
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,510
related questions and then the debugging
like the the iterative process of

1848
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:05,520
like the the iterative process of
 

1849
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,950
like the the iterative process of
running the script to figure out what

1850
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:06,960
running the script to figure out what
 

1851
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,269
running the script to figure out what
the error is maybe even for some people

1852
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:09,279
the error is maybe even for some people
 

1853
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,990
the error is maybe even for some people
to do the fix yourself yeah so do you

1854
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,000
to do the fix yourself yeah so do you
 

1855
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,990
to do the fix yourself yeah so do you
compile it do this like how do you

1856
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:14,000
compile it do this like how do you
 

1857
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,909
compile it do this like how do you
distribute that code to them and it's

1858
00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:15,919
distribute that code to them and it's
 

1859
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,630
distribute that code to them and it's
interesting because i think

1860
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:18,640
interesting because i think
 

1861
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,990
interesting because i think
it's exactly what you're talking about

1862
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,000
it's exactly what you're talking about
 

1863
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,950
it's exactly what you're talking about
if you increase the circle

1864
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:22,960
if you increase the circle
 

1865
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,430
if you increase the circle
of empathy that the circle of people

1866
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:25,440
of empathy that the circle of people
 

1867
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,950
of empathy that the circle of people
that are able to use your programs

1868
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:28,960
that are able to use your programs
 

1869
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,669
that are able to use your programs
you increase it its like effectiveness

1870
00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:31,679
you increase it its like effectiveness
 

1871
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,310
you increase it its like effectiveness
and its power and so yeah you have to

1872
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:34,320
and its power and so yeah you have to
 

1873
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,190
and its power and so yeah you have to
think

1874
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:35,200
think
 

1875
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,430
think
you know can i write scripts can i write

1876
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:37,440
you know can i write scripts can i write
 

1877
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,590
you know can i write scripts can i write
programs that can be used by biomedical

1878
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:39,600

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,789
people that don't know programming and
actually maybe plan to see

1884
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:46,799
actually maybe plan to see
 

1885
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,230
actually maybe plan to see
have them catch the bug of programming

1886
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:48,240
have them catch the bug of programming
 

1887
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,070
have them catch the bug of programming
so that they start on their journey

1888
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:50,080
so that they start on their journey
 

1889
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,590
so that they start on their journey
that's a huge responsibility and

1890
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:51,600
that's a huge responsibility and
 

1891
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,830
that's a huge responsibility and

2017
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,630
here's a main list it was very it wasn't
as it certainly were the tools that are

2018

as it certainly were the tools that are
 

2019
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,870
as it certainly were the tools that are
available today it was very early on but

2020
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:48,880
available today it was very early on but
 

2021
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,029

i think i did about seven packages that

2024
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:53,600
i think i did about seven packages that
 

2025
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,190
i think i did about seven packages that
year right and then by the end of the

2026
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:55,200
year right and then by the end of the
 

2027
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,389
year right and then by the end of the
year i collected them into a thing

2028
00:32:56,389 --> 00:32:56,399
year i collected them into a thing
 

2029
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,789
year i collected them into a thing
called multi-pack so 99 there was this

2030
00:32:58,789 --> 00:32:58,799
called multi-pack so 99 there was this
 

2031
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,710
called multi-pack so 99 there was this
thing called multi-pack and that's when

2032
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:00,720
thing called multi-pack and that's when
 

2033
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,070
thing called multi-pack and that's when
a high school student knows a high

took
 

2041
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,669
took
that package and made a windows

2042
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:07,679
that package and made a windows
 

2043
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,110
that package and made a windows
installer

2044
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:09,120
installer
 

2045
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,269
installer
right and then of course a massive

right and then of course a massive
 

2047
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,830
right and then of course a massive
increase of usage so by the way most of

00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:13,840
increase of usage so by the way most of
 

2049

modification to the kernel so i could
 

2065
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,549
modification to the kernel so i could
actually hard drive working

2066
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:30,559
actually hard drive working
 

2067
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,870
actually hard drive working
i i love that aspect of it i was also in

2068
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:32,880
i i love that aspect of it i was also in
 

2069
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,870
i i love that aspect of it i was also in
you know at school i was building a

2070
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:34,880
you know at school i was building a
 

2071
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,310
you know at school i was building a
cluster i took mac computers like uh and

2072
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:38,320
cluster i took mac computers like uh and
 

2073
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,630
cluster i took mac computers like uh and
you put yellow dog linux on them uh they

2074
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:40,640
you put yellow dog linux on them uh they
 

2075
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,909
you put yellow dog linux on them uh they
were at the mayo clinic they were just

2076
00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:41,919
were at the mayo clinic they were just
 

2077
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,350
were at the mayo clinic they were just
they're all these macs that were older

2078
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:43,360
they're all these macs that were older
 

2079
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,950
they're all these macs that were older
they were just getting rid of and so i

2080
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:44,960
they were just getting rid of and so i
 

2081
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,389
they were just getting rid of and so i
kind of got permission to go grab them

2082
00:33:46,389 --> 00:33:46,399
kind of got permission to go grab them
 

2083
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,149
kind of got permission to go grab them
together i put about 24 of them together

2084
00:33:48,149 --> 00:33:48,159
together i put about 24 of them together
 

2085
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,149
together i put about 24 of them together
in a cluster and a cabinet

2086
00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:50,159
in a cluster and a cabinet
 

2087
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,669
in a cluster and a cabinet
and put yellow dog linux on them all and

2088
00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:51,679
and put yellow dog linux on them all and
 

2089
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,230
and put yellow dog linux on them all and
i wrote a c plus plus um

2090
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:54,240
i wrote a c plus plus um
 

2091
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,310
i wrote a c plus plus um
program to do mri simulation that was

2092
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:56,320
program to do mri simulation that was
 

2093
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,750
program to do mri simulation that was
what i was doing

2094
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:57,760
what i was doing
 

2095
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,389
what i was doing
at the same time for my day job so to

2096
00:34:00,389 --> 00:34:00,399
at the same time for my day job so to
 

2097
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,269
at the same time for my day job so to
speak so i was loving the whole process

2098
00:34:03,269 --> 00:34:03,279
speak so i was loving the whole process
 

2099
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,110
speak so i was loving the whole process
at the same time i was oh i need to

2100
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:05,120
at the same time i was oh i need to
 

2101
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,230
at the same time i was oh i need to
ordinary differential equation that's

2102
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:06,240
ordinary differential equation that's
 

2103
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,669
ordinary differential equation that's
why ordinary difference equations were

2104
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:07,679
why ordinary difference equations were
 

2105
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,030
why ordinary difference equations were
key was because that's the heart of a

2106
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:09,040
key was because that's the heart of a
 

2107
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,349
key was because that's the heart of a
block equation for simulated mri is a

2108
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:11,359
block equation for simulated mri is a
 

2109
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,829
block equation for simulated mri is a
ode solver and so that's

2110
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:13,839
ode solver and so that's
 

2111
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,510
ode solver and so that's
but i actually did that

2112
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:15,520
but i actually did that
 

2113
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,790
but i actually did that
it doesn't happen at the same time

2114
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:16,800
it doesn't happen at the same time
 

2115
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,990
it doesn't happen at the same time
that's why it kind of what you're

2116
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:18,000
that's why it kind of what you're
 

2117
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,190
that's why it kind of what you're
working on and what you're interested in

2118
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,200
working on and what you're interested in
 

2119
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,790
working on and what you're interested in
they're coinciding i was definitely

2120
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:20,800
they're coinciding i was definitely
 

2121
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,310
they're coinciding i was definitely
scratching my own itch

2122
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:22,320
scratching my own itch
 

2123
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,190
scratching my own itch
in terms of building stuff and uh which

2124
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:25,200
in terms of building stuff and uh which
 

2125
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,550
in terms of building stuff and uh which
helped in the sense that i was using it

2126
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:26,560
helped in the sense that i was using it
 

2127
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,470
helped in the sense that i was using it
for me so at least had one user yeah i

2128
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:28,480
for me so at least had one user yeah i
 

2129
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,750
for me so at least had one user yeah i
had one person who's like well i know

2130
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:29,760
had one person who's like well i know
 

2131
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,030
had one person who's like well i know
this is better i like this interface

2132
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,040
this is better i like this interface
 

2133
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,629
this is better i like this interface
better and i had the experience of

2134
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:32,639
better and i had the experience of
 

2135
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,190
better and i had the experience of
matlab to guide some of what those apis

2136
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:35,200
matlab to guide some of what those apis
 

2137
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,950
matlab to guide some of what those apis
might look like but you know you're just

2138
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:36,960
might look like but you know you're just
 

2139
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,310
might look like but you know you're just
doing yourself you're building all this

2140
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:38,320
doing yourself you're building all this
 

2141
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,990
doing yourself you're building all this
stuff but with the windows installer it

2142
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:40,000
stuff but with the windows installer it
 

2143
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,349
stuff but with the windows installer it
was the first time i realized oh yeah

2144
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:41,359
was the first time i realized oh yeah
 

2145
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,589
was the first time i realized oh yeah
the binary installer really helps people

2146
00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:43,599
the binary installer really helps people
 

2147
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,790
the binary installer really helps people
and so

2148
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:44,800
and so
 

2149
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,829
and so
that led to spending more time on that

2150
00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:47,839
that led to spending more time on that
 

2151
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,149
that led to spending more time on that
side of things so around 2000 so i

2152
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:50,159
side of things so around 2000 so i
 

2153
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,190
side of things so around 2000 so i
graduated my phd in 2000 end of year

2154
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:53,200
graduated my phd in 2000 end of year
 

2155
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,190
graduated my phd in 2000 end of year
2000. so

2156
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:55,200
2000. so
 

2157
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,109
2000. so
99 doing a lot of work there 98 do a lot

2158
00:34:57,109 --> 00:34:57,119
99 doing a lot of work there 98 do a lot
 

2159
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,109
99 doing a lot of work there 98 do a lot
of work there 99 kind of spending more

2160
00:34:59,109 --> 00:34:59,119
of work there 99 kind of spending more
 

2161
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,270
of work there 99 kind of spending more
time on my phd you know helping people

2162
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:01,280
time on my phd you know helping people
 

2163
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,870
time on my phd you know helping people
use the tools thinking about what i want

2164
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:02,880
use the tools thinking about what i want
 

2165
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,630
use the tools thinking about what i want
to go from here there was a company

2166
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:04,640
to go from here there was a company
 

2167
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,630
to go from here there was a company
there's a guy actually eric jones and

00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:09,119
travis vott they were two friends who
 

2171
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,190
travis vott they were two friends who
founded a company called nthot it's here

2172
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:11,200
founded a company called nthot it's here
 

2173
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,510
founded a company called nthot it's here
in austin still here

i was a graduate student still and he

2182
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:19,440
i was a graduate student still and he
 

2183
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,870
i was a graduate student still and he
said hey why don't you come down we want

2184
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:20,880
said hey why don't you come down we want
 

2185
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,310
said hey why don't you come down we want
to build a company

2186
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:22,320
to build a company
 

2187
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,750
to build a company
you know we want we're thinking of you

2188
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:23,760
you know we want we're thinking of you
 

2189
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,109
you know we want we're thinking of you
know a scientific

2190
00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:25,119
know a scientific
 

2191
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,109
know a scientific
company and we want to take what you're

2192
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:27,119
company and we want to take what you're
 

2193
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,630
company and we want to take what you're
doing and kind of add it to some stuff

2194
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:28,640
doing and kind of add it to some stuff
 

2195
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,950
doing and kind of add it to some stuff
that he'd done he'd written some tools

2196
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:30,960
that he'd done he'd written some tools
 

2197
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,710
that he'd done he'd written some tools
and then pierre peterson had done ftp

2198
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:32,720
and then pierre peterson had done ftp
 

2199
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,550
and then pierre peterson had done ftp
let's come together and build pull this

2200
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:34,560
let's come together and build pull this
 

2201
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,630
let's come together and build pull this
all together and call it sci-fi

2202
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:36,640
all together and call it sci-fi
 

2203
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,349
all together and call it sci-fi
so that's the origin of the scipy brand

2204
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:39,359
so that's the origin of the scipy brand
 

2205
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,349
so that's the origin of the scipy brand
it came from you know multi-pack and a

2206
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:41,359
it came from you know multi-pack and a
 

2207
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,710
it came from you know multi-pack and a
whole bunch of modules i'd written plus

2208
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:42,720
whole bunch of modules i'd written plus
 

2209
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,390
whole bunch of modules i'd written plus
a few things from some other folks and

2210
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:44,400
a few things from some other folks and
 

2211
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,589
a few things from some other folks and
then pulled together in a single

2212
00:35:45,589 --> 00:35:45,599
then pulled together in a single
 

2213
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,430
then pulled together in a single
installer

2214
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:47,440
installer
 

2215
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,950
installer
sci-fi was really a distribution of

00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:48,960
sci-fi was really a distribution of
 

2217
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,109
sci-fi was really a distribution of
python masquerading as a library

2218

python masquerading as a library
 

2219
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,950
python masquerading as a library
how did you think about sci-fi in

2220
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:52,960
how did you think about sci-fi in
 

2221
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,589
how did you think about sci-fi in

so consensus building was still was was

2304
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:11,280
so consensus building was still was was
 

2305
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,950
so consensus building was still was was
challenging at scale as more people came

2306

challenging at scale as more people came
 

2307
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,630
challenging at scale as more people came
in right early on it's fine because

2308
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:14,640
in right early on it's fine because
 

2309
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,310
in right early on it's fine because
there's nobody there and so it works but

2310
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:16,320
there's nobody there and so it works but
 

2311
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,829
there's nobody there and so it works but
then as you get more successful the more

2312
00:37:17,829 --> 00:37:17,839
then as you get more successful the more
 

2313
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,430
then as you get more successful the more
people use it all of a sudden oh there's

2314
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:19,440
people use it all of a sudden oh there's
 

2315
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,790
people use it all of a sudden oh there's
this this

2316
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:20,800
this this
 

2317
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,230
this this
scale at which this doesn't work anymore

2318
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:22,240
scale at which this doesn't work anymore
 

2319
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,030
scale at which this doesn't work anymore
and we have to come up with different

and we have to come up with different
 

2321
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,270
and we have to come up with different
approaches so sci-fi came out officially

2379
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,150
language that i used york is a
programming language it was a

2380
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:24,160
programming language it was a
 

2381
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,390
programming language it was a
programming language had a plotting tool

2382
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:26,400
programming language had a plotting tool
 

2383
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,430
programming language had a plotting tool
dislin

2384
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:27,440
dislin
 

2385
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,030
dislin
it we had integration to dislike i ended

2386
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:29,040
it we had integration to dislike i ended
 

2387
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,870
it we had integration to dislike i ended
up using dislin plus some some of the

2388
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:30,880
up using dislin plus some some of the
 

2389
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,710
up using dislin plus some some of the
plotting from yorick

2390
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:32,720
plotting from yorick
 

2391
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,670
plotting from yorick
linked to from python anyway it was a

2392
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:35,680
linked to from python anyway it was a
 

2393
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,349
linked to from python anyway it was a
people don't plot that way now but this

2394
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:37,359
people don't plot that way now but this
 

2395
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,430
people don't plot that way now but this
is before and scipy was trying to add

2396
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:39,440
is before and scipy was trying to add
 

2397
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,349
is before and scipy was trying to add
plotting yeah right

2398
00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:41,359
plotting yeah right
 

2399
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:42,790
plotting yeah right
it didn't have much success really the

2400
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:42,800
it didn't have much success really the
 

2401
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,310
it didn't have much success really the
success of plotting came from john

2402
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:44,320
success of plotting came from john
 

2403
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,349
success of plotting came from john

hunter
 

2405
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,870
hunter
who had a similar experience to my

2406
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:46,880
who had a similar experience to my
 

2407
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,069
who had a similar experience to my
experience my kind of maverick

experience my kind of maverick
 

2409
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,910
experience my kind of maverick
experience as a person just trying to

00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:49,920
experience as a person just trying to
 

2411
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,349
experience as a person just trying to
get stuff done and kind of having more

2412
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:51,359
get stuff done and kind of having more
 

2413
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,829
get stuff done and kind of having more
time than than money maybe right and

2414
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:53,839
time than than money maybe right and
 

2415
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,150
time than than money maybe right and
john hunter created what not plot lube

2416
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:56,160
john hunter created what not plot lube
 

2417
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,750
john hunter created what not plot lube
he's the creator of map yeah so john

2418
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:57,760
he's the creator of map yeah so john
 

2419
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,430
he's the creator of map yeah so john
hunter was uh you know he wasn't a

2420
00:38:59,430 --> 00:38:59,440
hunter was uh you know he wasn't a
 

2421
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,470
hunter was uh you know he wasn't a
student at the time but he was an actor

2422
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:00,480
student at the time but he was an actor
 

2423
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,829
student at the time but he was an actor
he was working in quant field and he

2424
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:01,839
he was working in quant field and he
 

2425
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,670
he was working in quant field and he
said we need better plotting so he just

2426
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:03,680
said we need better plotting so he just
 

2427
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,950
said we need better plotting so he just
went out and said cool i'll make a new

2428
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:04,960
went out and said cool i'll make a new
 

2429
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,550
went out and said cool i'll make a new
project and we'll call it matplotlib and

2430
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:06,560
project and we'll call it matplotlib and
 

2431
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,870
project and we'll call it matplotlib and
he released in 2001. about the same time

2432
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:08,880
he released in 2001. about the same time
 

2433
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,870
he released in 2001. about the same time
that scipy came out and it was separate

2434
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:10,880
that scipy came out and it was separate
 

2435
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,790
that scipy came out and it was separate
library separate install

2436
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:12,800
library separate install
 

2437
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,430
library separate install
use numeric sci-fi use numeric

2438
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:15,440
use numeric sci-fi use numeric
 

2439
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,470
use numeric sci-fi use numeric
and so scipy you know 2001 released

2440
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:18,480
and so scipy you know 2001 released
 

2441
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,630
and so scipy you know 2001 released
scipy and then m-thot created a

2442
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:20,640
scipy and then m-thot created a
 

2443
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,870
scipy and then m-thot created a
conference called scipy which

2444
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:22,880
conference called scipy which
 

2445
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,230
conference called scipy which
was brought people together to talk

2446
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:24,240
was brought people together to talk
 

2447
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,990
was brought people together to talk
about the space another conference is

2448
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:26,000
about the space another conference is
 

2449
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,349
about the space another conference is
still ongoing it's one of the favorite

2450
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:27,359
still ongoing it's one of the favorite
 

2451
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:28,630
still ongoing it's one of the favorite
conferences of a lot of people because

2452
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:28,640
conferences of a lot of people because
 

2453
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,430
conferences of a lot of people because
it's

2454
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:29,440
it's
 

2455
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,190
it's
it's changed over the years but early on

2456
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:31,200
it's changed over the years but early on
 

2457
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,190
it's changed over the years but early on
it was you know a collection of 50

2458
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:33,200
it was you know a collection of 50
 

2459
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,190
it was you know a collection of 50
people who care about

2460
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:35,200
people who care about
 

2461
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,630
people who care about
scientists mostly

scientists mostly
 

2463
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,069
scientists mostly
practicing scientists who want to care

practicing scientists who want to care
 

2465
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:38,790
practicing scientists who want to care
about

2466
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:38,800
about
 

2467
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,790
about
coding and doing it well and not using

2468
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:40,800
coding and doing it well and not using
 

2469
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,990
coding and doing it well and not using
matlab

2470
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:42,000
matlab
 

2471
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,349
matlab
i remember being driven by you know i

2472
00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:43,359
i remember being driven by you know i
 

2473
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,109
i remember being driven by you know i
like matlab but i didn't like the fact

2474
00:39:45,109 --> 00:39:45,119
like matlab but i didn't like the fact
 

2475
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,510
like matlab but i didn't like the fact
that like so i'm not opposed proprietary

2476
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:47,520
that like so i'm not opposed proprietary
 

2477
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,750
that like so i'm not opposed proprietary
software i'm actually not an open source

2478
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:49,760
software i'm actually not an open source
 

2479
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,069
software i'm actually not an open source
zealot i love open source for the what

2480
00:39:52,069 --> 00:39:52,079
zealot i love open source for the what
 

2481
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,510
zealot i love open source for the what
it brings but i also see the role for

2482
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:53,520
it brings but i also see the role for
 

2483
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,950
it brings but i also see the role for
proprietary software what i didn't like

2484
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:54,960
proprietary software what i didn't like
 

2485
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,589
proprietary software what i didn't like
was the fact that i would develop code

2486
00:39:57,589 --> 00:39:57,599
was the fact that i would develop code
 

2487
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,190
was the fact that i would develop code
and publish it and then effectively

2488
00:39:59,190 --> 00:39:59,200
and publish it and then effectively
 

2489
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,870
and publish it and then effectively
telling somebody here to run my code you

2490
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:00,880
telling somebody here to run my code you
 

2491
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,470
telling somebody here to run my code you
have to have this proprietary software

2492
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:02,480
have to have this proprietary software
 

2493
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,990
have to have this proprietary software
right and there's also culture around

2494
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:04,000
right and there's also culture around
 

2495
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,190
right and there's also culture around
matlab

2496
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:05,200
matlab
 

2497
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,710
matlab
as much because i've talked to a few

2498
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:06,720
as much because i've talked to a few
 

2499
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,309
as much because i've talked to a few
folks

2500
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:08,319
folks
 

2501
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,710
folks
math works great it's my life yeah

2502
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:10,720
math works great it's my life yeah
 

2503
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,190
math works great it's my life yeah
i mean there's just a culture they try

2504
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:13,200
i mean there's just a culture they try
 

2505
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,710
i mean there's just a culture they try
really hard but it's just there's this

2506
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:14,720
really hard but it's just there's this
 

2507
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,670
really hard but it's just there's this
corporate ibm style culture that's like

2508
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:17,680
corporate ibm style culture that's like
 

2509
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,190
corporate ibm style culture that's like
or whatever i don't don't want to say

2510
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:19,200
or whatever i don't don't want to say
 

2511
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,630
or whatever i don't don't want to say
negative things about ibm or whatever

2512
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:20,640
negative things about ibm or whatever
 

2513
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,150
negative things about ibm or whatever
but there's a

2514
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:22,160
but there's a
 

2515
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,670
but there's a
no it's it's really that connection

2516
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:23,680
no it's it's really that connection
 

2517
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,870
no it's it's really that connection
something i'm in the middle of right now

2518
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:24,880
something i'm in the middle of right now
 

2519
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,950
something i'm in the middle of right now
is is the business of open source and

2520
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:26,960
is is the business of open source and
 

2521
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,589
is is the business of open source and
how do you connect the ethos of

2522
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:29,599
how do you connect the ethos of
 

2523
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,190
how do you connect the ethos of
cooperative development with the

2524
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:31,200
cooperative development with the
 

2525
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,630
cooperative development with the
necessity of

2526
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:32,640
necessity of
 

2527
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,390
necessity of
of creating profits

2528
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:34,400
of creating profits
 

2529
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,550
of creating profits
right and like right now today you know

2530
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:36,560
right and like right now today you know
 

2531
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,829
right and like right now today you know
i'm still i'm still in the middle of

2532
00:40:37,829 --> 00:40:37,839
i'm still i'm still in the middle of
 

2533
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:39,990
i'm still i'm still in the middle of
that that's actually the early days of

2534
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:40,000
that that's actually the early days of
 

2535
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,069
that that's actually the early days of

things that i really loved and i learned
 

2719
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,870
things that i really loved and i learned
from that it was writings from people

2720
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:24,880
from that it was writings from people
 

2721
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,870
from that it was writings from people
like von mises he wrote a pre-order

2722
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:26,880
like von mises he wrote a pre-order
 

2723
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,950
like von mises he wrote a pre-order
paper in 1920 that still should be read

2724
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:28,960
paper in 1920 that still should be read
 

2725
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,790
paper in 1920 that still should be read
more than it is it's got i mean it was

2726
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:30,800
more than it is it's got i mean it was
 

2727
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,109
more than it is it's got i mean it was
the economic calculation problem of the

2728
00:43:33,109 --> 00:43:33,119
the economic calculation problem of the
 

2729
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,870
the economic calculation problem of the
socialist commonwealth it's basically in

2730
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:34,880
socialist commonwealth it's basically in
 

2731
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,309

response to the bolshevik revolution in
 

2733
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,950
response to the bolshevik revolution in
1917. and his basic argument was it's

2734
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:38,960
1917. and his basic argument was it's
 

2735

not going to work to not have private
 

2737
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,470
not going to work to not have private
property you're not going to be able to

2738
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:42,480
property you're not going to be able to
 

2739
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,990
property you're not going to be able to
come up with prices the bureaucrats

2740
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:44,000
come up with prices the bureaucrats
 

2741
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,190
come up with prices the bureaucrats
aren't going to be able to determine how

2742
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:45,200
aren't going to be able to determine how
 

2743
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,030
aren't going to be able to determine how
to allocate resources without a price

2744
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:47,040
to allocate resources without a price
 

2745
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,910
to allocate resources without a price
system and a price system emerges from

2746
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:49,920
system and a price system emerges from
 

2747
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,230
system and a price system emerges from
people making trades and they can only

2748
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:52,240
people making trades and they can only
 

2749
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,829
people making trades and they can only
make trades if they have authority over

2750
00:43:53,829 --> 00:43:53,839
make trades if they have authority over
 

2751
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,349
make trades if they have authority over
the thing they're trading

2752
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:55,359
the thing they're trading
 

2753
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,430
the thing they're trading
and that that that creates information

2754
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:57,440
and that that that creates information
 

2755
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,510
and that that that creates information
flow that you just don't have

2756
00:43:59,510 --> 00:43:59,520
flow that you just don't have
 

2757
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,990
flow that you just don't have
if you try to top down it right right

2758
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:02,000
if you try to top down it right right
 

2759
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,630
if you try to top down it right right
it's like huh that's a really good point

2760
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:04,640
it's like huh that's a really good point
 

2761
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,470
it's like huh that's a really good point
yeah the prices have a signal that's

2762
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:06,480
yeah the prices have a signal that's
 

2763
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,309
yeah the prices have a signal that's
used and it's important to have that

2764
00:44:08,309 --> 00:44:08,319
used and it's important to have that
 

2765
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,270
used and it's important to have that
signal

2766
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:09,280
signal
 

2767
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,870
signal
when you're trying to build a community

2768
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:10,880
when you're trying to build a community
 

2769

when you're trying to build a community
of productive people like you would in

2770
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:12,560
of productive people like you would in
 

2771
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,390
of productive people like you would in
the software engineering yeah the prices

2772
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:14,400
the software engineering yeah the prices
 

2773
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,990
the software engineering yeah the prices
are actually an important

2774
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:16,000
are actually an important
 

2775
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,069
are actually an important
signaling mechanism yeah right and that

2776
00:44:18,069 --> 00:44:18,079
signaling mechanism yeah right and that
 

2777
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:19,190
signaling mechanism yeah right and that
money

2778
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:19,200
money
 

2779
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,270
money
is just a bartering tool right so this

2780
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:21,280
is just a bartering tool right so this
 

2781
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,630
is just a bartering tool right so this
is the first time i've encountered any

2782
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:22,640
is the first time i've encountered any
 

2783
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,309
is the first time i've encountered any
of this concept right and the fact that

2784
00:44:24,309 --> 00:44:24,319
of this concept right and the fact that
 

2785
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:25,829
of this concept right and the fact that
oh this is actually

2786
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:25,839
oh this is actually
 

2787
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:27,990
oh this is actually
really critical like it's so critical to

2788
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:28,000
really critical like it's so critical to
 

2789
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,069
really critical like it's so critical to
our prosperity and

2790
00:44:30,069 --> 00:44:30,079
our prosperity and
 

2791
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,109
our prosperity and
that

2792
00:44:31,109 --> 00:44:31,119
that
 

2793
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:32,950
that
we're dangerously

2794
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:32,960
we're dangerously
 

2795
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,550
we're dangerously
not learning about this not teaching our

2796
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:34,560
not learning about this not teaching our
 

2797
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,309
not learning about this not teaching our
children about this you know so you had

2798
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:36,319
children about this you know so you had
 

2799
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:37,829
children about this you know so you had
the three kids you had to make some

2800
00:44:37,829 --> 00:44:37,839
the three kids you had to make some
 

2801
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,109
the three kids you had to make some
stuff how to make some money right i had

2802
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:39,119
stuff how to make some money right i had
 

2803
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,230
stuff how to make some money right i had
to figure it out but i didn't really

2804
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:40,240
to figure it out but i didn't really
 

2805
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,670
to figure it out but i didn't really
care i mean i was never i've never been

2806
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:41,680
care i mean i was never i've never been
 

2807
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,630
care i mean i was never i've never been
driven by money just need it right right

2808
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:44,640
driven by money just need it right right
 

2809
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,190
driven by money just need it right right
to eat so what how did that resolve

2810
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:47,200
to eat so what how did that resolve
 

2811
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,950
to eat so what how did that resolve
itself in terms of sci-fi

2812
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:48,960
itself in terms of sci-fi
 

2813
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,790
itself in terms of sci-fi
so i would say it didn't really resolve

2814
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:50,800
so i would say it didn't really resolve
 

2815
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,230
so i would say it didn't really resolve
itself it sort of started a journey that

2816
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:52,240
itself it sort of started a journey that
 

2817
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,069
itself it sort of started a journey that
i'm continuing on i'm still on i would

2818
00:44:54,069 --> 00:44:54,079
i'm continuing on i'm still on i would
 

2819
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:55,750
i'm continuing on i'm still on i would
say i don't think it resolved itself but

2820
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:55,760
say i don't think it resolved itself but
 

2821
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,030
say i don't think it resolved itself but
i will say

2822
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:57,040
i will say
 

2823
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,670
i will say
i i went in wide eyes wide open like i

2824
00:44:59,670 --> 00:44:59,680
i i went in wide eyes wide open like i
 

2825
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,349
i i went in wide eyes wide open like i
knew that there were problems with you

2826
00:45:01,349 --> 00:45:01,359
knew that there were problems with you
 

2827
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:04,309
knew that there were problems with you
know um giving stuff away and creating

2828
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:04,319
know um giving stuff away and creating
 

2829
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,990
know um giving stuff away and creating
uh the the ex market externalities the

2830
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:08,000
uh the the ex market externalities the
 

2831
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,750
uh the the ex market externalities the
fact that yeah people might use it and i

2832
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:09,760
fact that yeah people might use it and i
 

2833
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,870
fact that yeah people might use it and i
might not get paid for it and i'll have

2834
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:10,880
might not get paid for it and i'll have
 

2835
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,790
might not get paid for it and i'll have
to figure something else out to get paid

2836
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:12,800
to figure something else out to get paid
 

2837
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,870
to figure something else out to get paid
like at least i can say i'm not bitter

2838
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:14,880
like at least i can say i'm not bitter
 

2839
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,550
like at least i can say i'm not bitter
that a lot of people have used stuff

2840
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:16,560
that a lot of people have used stuff
 

2841
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,829
that a lot of people have used stuff
that i've written and i haven't

2842
00:45:17,829 --> 00:45:17,839
that i've written and i haven't
 

2843
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:19,430
that i've written and i haven't
necessarily benefited economically from

2844
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:19,440
necessarily benefited economically from
 

2845
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,190
necessarily benefited economically from
it like yeah i've heard other people be

2846

notion was there i appreciate that and i

2876
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:48,960
notion was there i appreciate that and i
 

2877

00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:52,800
surely mechanism mechanism i totally
 

2881
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,309
surely mechanism mechanism i totally
agree i would love to talk about some of

2882
00:45:54,309 --> 00:45:54,319
agree i would love to talk about some of
 

2883
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:55,750
agree i would love to talk about some of
the ideas i have because i actually came

2884
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:55,760
the ideas i have because i actually came
 

2885
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,950
the ideas i have because i actually came
across i think i've come up with some

2886
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:56,960
across i think i've come up with some
 

2887
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,109
across i think i've come up with some
interesting notions that could work but

2888
00:45:59,109 --> 00:45:59,119
interesting notions that could work but
 

2889
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:00,390
interesting notions that could work but
they'll require

2890
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:00,400
they'll require
 

2891
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,069
they'll require
you know anything that will work takes

2892
00:46:02,069 --> 00:46:02,079
you know anything that will work takes
 

2893
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:04,150
you know anything that will work takes
time to emerge right like things don't

2894
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:04,160
time to emerge right like things don't
 

2895
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,109
time to emerge right like things don't
just turn overnight that's definitely

2896
00:46:05,109 --> 00:46:05,119
just turn overnight that's definitely
 

2897
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,309
just turn overnight that's definitely
one thing i've also understood and

2898
00:46:06,309 --> 00:46:06,319
one thing i've also understood and
 

2899
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:07,270
one thing i've also understood and
learned

2900
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:07,280
learned
 

2901
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,950
learned
is any fixes

2902
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:08,960
is any fixes
 

2903
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,309
is any fixes
that's why it's kind of funny we often

2904
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:10,319
that's why it's kind of funny we often
 

2905
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,069
that's why it's kind of funny we often
give credit to you know oh this

2906
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:12,079
give credit to you know oh this
 

2907
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:13,270
give credit to you know oh this
president gets elected and oh look how

2908
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:13,280
president gets elected and oh look how
 

2909
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,390
president gets elected and oh look how
great things have done

2910
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:14,400
great things have done
 

2911
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,030
great things have done
and

2912
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:15,040
and
 

2913
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,670
and
i saw that when when i had a transition

2914
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:17,680
i saw that when when i had a transition
 

2915
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,349
i saw that when when i had a transition
in a condo when a new ceo came in right

2916
00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:19,359
in a condo when a new ceo came in right
 

2917
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,270
in a condo when a new ceo came in right
and it's like the success that's

2918
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:21,280
and it's like the success that's
 

2919
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,750
and it's like the success that's
happening there's an inertia there yeah

2920
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:23,760
happening there's an inertia there yeah
 

2921
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,430
happening there's an inertia there yeah
right and sometimes the decision you

2922
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:25,440
right and sometimes the decision you
 

2923
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,349
right and sometimes the decision you
made like 10 years before is the reason

2924
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:27,359
made like 10 years before is the reason
 

2925
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,750
made like 10 years before is the reason
why the successes see right exactly so

2926
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:29,760
why the successes see right exactly so
 

2927
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,109
why the successes see right exactly so
we're sort of just running around taking

2928
00:46:31,109 --> 00:46:31,119
we're sort of just running around taking
 

2929
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,030
we're sort of just running around taking
credit for stuff credit assignment has

2930
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:33,040
credit for stuff credit assignment has
 

2931
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,030
credit for stuff credit assignment has
like a delay to it yes

2932
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:35,040
like a delay to it yes
 

2933
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,710
like a delay to it yes
that this makes the credit assignment

2934
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:36,720
that this makes the credit assignment
 

2935
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,270
that this makes the credit assignment
basically wrong more than right wrong

2936
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:39,280
basically wrong more than right wrong
 

2937
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,710
basically wrong more than right wrong
more than right exactly and so i'm like

2938
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:40,720
more than right exactly and so i'm like
 

2939
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,550
more than right exactly and so i'm like
oh this is you know that's the stuff i

would i would read a ton about you know
 

2943
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,349
would i would read a ton about you know
early on so i don't i feel like i'm with

00:47:01,589 --> 00:47:01,599
um trajectory from academia is reading
 

2961
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,349
um trajectory from academia is reading
that stuff letting me say oh

2962
00:47:03,349 --> 00:47:03,359
that stuff letting me say oh
 

2963

entrepreneurship matters
 

2965
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,150
entrepreneurship matters
so i love software but entre but we need

2966
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:08,160
so i love software but entre but we need
 

2967
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,430

had that that virus infect my brain
 

2973
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,589
had that that virus infect my brain
it even though i was on a trajectory to

2974
00:47:17,589 --> 00:47:17,599
it even though i was on a trajectory to
 

2975
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,349
it even though i was on a trajectory to
go to a tenure track position at a

2976
00:47:19,349 --> 00:47:19,359
go to a tenure track position at a
 

2977
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:20,470
go to a tenure track position at a
university

2978
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:20,480
university
 

2979
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,190
university
and i was there for six years i was kind

2980
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:23,200
and i was there for six years i was kind
 

2981
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,190
and i was there for six years i was kind
of already out the door

2982
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:25,200
of already out the door
 

2983
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,790
of already out the door
when i started and we can get into that

2984
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:26,800
when i started and we can get into that
 

2985
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,950
when i started and we can get into that
but yeah um what can i just ask a quick

question on

2988
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:30,240
question on
 

2989
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,710
question on
is there some design principles that

2990
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:32,720
is there some design principles that
 

2991
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,349
is there some design principles that
were in your mind around sci-pi like is

2992
00:47:35,349 --> 00:47:35,359
were in your mind around sci-pi like is
 

2993
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:37,030
were in your mind around sci-pi like is
there some key ideas that were just like

2994
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:37,040
there some key ideas that were just like
 

2995
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,190
there some key ideas that were just like
sticking to you that this is this is the

2996
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:39,200
sticking to you that this is this is the
 

2997
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,950
sticking to you that this is this is the
fundamental ideas yeah i would say so i

2998
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:40,960
fundamental ideas yeah i would say so i
 

2999
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,710
fundamental ideas yeah i would say so i
would think it's basically accessibility

3000
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:42,720
would think it's basically accessibility
 

3001
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,870
would think it's basically accessibility
to scientists like give them give

3002
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:44,880
to scientists like give them give
 

3003

to scientists like give them give
scientists and engineers tools they

3004

scientists and engineers tools they
 

3005
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,829

don't have to think a lot about
 

3007
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:49,109
don't have to think a lot about
programming so give them really good

3008
00:47:49,109 --> 00:47:49,119
programming so give them really good
 

3009
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:51,030
programming so give them really good
building blocks give them functions that

3010
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:51,040
building blocks give them functions that
 

3011
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,549
building blocks give them functions that
they want to call and

3012
00:47:52,549 --> 00:47:52,559
they want to call and

there's a

there's a
 

3021
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,309
there's a
one tradition in programming where it's

3022
00:47:58,309 --> 00:47:58,319
one tradition in programming where it's
 

3023
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:01,270
one tradition in programming where it's
like you know make very very long names

3024
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:01,280
like you know make very very long names
 

3025
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,870
like you know make very very long names
right and you can see it in some

3026
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:02,880
right and you can see it in some
 

3027
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,470
right and you can see it in some
programming languages where the names

3028
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:04,480
programming languages where the names
 

3029
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,190
programming languages where the names
get you know take half the screen and

3030
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:07,200
get you know take half the screen and

3037
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,150
to be six six letters early on right and
that's way too too much too too little

that's way too too much too too little
 

3039

that's way too too much too too little
but i was like

i like to have names that were

i like to have names that were
 

3043
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:19,750

informative but short so even though

but
 

3051
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,670

documentation is doing some work there

3052
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:25,680
documentation is doing some work there
 

3053
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,549
documentation is doing some work there
so when you look at great scientific

3054

so when you look at great scientific
 

3055
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,790
so when you look at great scientific
libraries and functions there's

3056
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:30,800
libraries and functions there's
 

3057
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,710
libraries and functions there's
there's a richness of documentation that

3058
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:32,720
there's a richness of documentation that
 

3059
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,710
there's a richness of documentation that
helps you get into the details

3060
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:34,720
helps you get into the details
 

3061
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,710
helps you get into the details
the first glance that a function gives

3062
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:36,720
the first glance that a function gives
 

3063
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,549
the first glance that a function gives
you the intuition of all it needs to do

3064
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:38,559
you the intuition of all it needs to do
 

3065
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,549
you the intuition of all it needs to do
by looking at the headers and so on but

3066
00:48:40,549 --> 00:48:40,559
by looking at the headers and so on but
 

3067
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,150
by looking at the headers and so on but
to get the depths of all the

00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:42,160
to get the depths of all the
 

3069
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,910
to get the depths of all the
complexities involved all the options

3070

they had more knowledge than they did

3166
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:07,520
they had more knowledge than they did
 

3167
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,030
they had more knowledge than they did
and so i would just speak at a very high

3168
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:09,040
and so i would just speak at a very high
 

3169
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,190
and so i would just speak at a very high
level yeah assume they got it but they

3170
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:11,200
level yeah assume they got it but they
 

3171
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,910
level yeah assume they got it but they
need to rise to the standard that you

3172
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:13,920
need to rise to the standard that you
 

3173
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,430
need to rise to the standard that you
set i mean that's one of the some of the

3174
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:15,440
set i mean that's one of the some of the
 

3175
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,190
set i mean that's one of the some of the
greatest teachers do that yeah and i

3176
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:17,200
greatest teachers do that yeah and i
 

3177
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,230
greatest teachers do that yeah and i
agree and that was kind of what was

3178
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:18,240
agree and that was kind of what was
 

3179
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,549
agree and that was kind of what was
inspiring me but but you know you also

3180
00:50:20,549 --> 00:50:20,559
inspiring me but but you know you also
 

3181
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:21,990
inspiring me but but you know you also
have to

3182
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:22,000
have to
 

3183
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,630
have to
i i cannot say i was uh i was articulate

3184
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:24,640
i i cannot say i was uh i was articulate
 

3185
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,230
i i cannot say i was uh i was articulate
to some of the greatest teachers right i

3186
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:26,240
to some of the greatest teachers right i
 

3187
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,069
to some of the greatest teachers right i
was you know like one one classic

3188
00:50:28,069 --> 00:50:28,079
was you know like one one classic
 

3189
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,390
was you know like one one classic
example when i first taught at byu my

3190
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:30,400
example when i first taught at byu my
 

3191
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,829
example when i first taught at byu my
very first class it was overheads

3192
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:31,839
very first class it was overheads
 

3193
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:33,990
very first class it was overheads
transparencies overheads

3194
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:34,000
transparencies overheads
 

3195
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,750
transparencies overheads
before projectors are really that common

3196
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:35,760
before projectors are really that common
 

3197
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,430
before projectors are really that common
i saw transparencies i'm writing my

3198
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:37,440
i saw transparencies i'm writing my
 

3199
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,390
i saw transparencies i'm writing my
notes out i go in room's half dark

3200
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:40,400
notes out i go in room's half dark
 

3201
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,069
notes out i go in room's half dark
i just blaring through these

3202
00:50:42,069 --> 00:50:42,079
i just blaring through these
 

3203
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:43,349
i just blaring through these
transparencies here it is here it is

3204
00:50:43,349 --> 00:50:43,359
transparencies here it is here it is
 

3205
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:44,710
transparencies here it is here it is
here it is

3206
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:44,720
here it is
 

3207
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,349
here it is
and i gave a quiz after two weeks

3208
00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:47,359
and i gave a quiz after two weeks
 

3209
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:48,870
and i gave a quiz after two weeks
nobody knew anything

3210
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:48,880
nobody knew anything
 

3211
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,069
nobody knew anything
nothing i had gotten anywhere

3212
00:50:52,069 --> 00:50:52,079
nothing i had gotten anywhere
 

3213
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:53,589
nothing i had gotten anywhere
and i realized okay i'm not this is not

3214
00:50:53,589 --> 00:50:53,599
and i realized okay i'm not this is not
 

3215
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:55,190
and i realized okay i'm not this is not
working so i took put away the

3216
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:55,200
working so i took put away the
 

3217
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,950
working so i took put away the
transparencies and i turned around just

3218
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:56,960
transparencies and i turned around just
 

3219
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,630
transparencies and i turned around just
started using the chalkboard

3220
00:50:58,630 --> 00:50:58,640
started using the chalkboard
 

3221
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,549
started using the chalkboard
and what it did is it slowed me down

3222
00:51:00,549 --> 00:51:00,559
and what it did is it slowed me down
 

3223
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,069
and what it did is it slowed me down
right the chalkboard just slowed me down

3224
00:51:02,069 --> 00:51:02,079
right the chalkboard just slowed me down
 

3225
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:03,910
right the chalkboard just slowed me down
and gave people time to process and to

3226
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:03,920
and gave people time to process and to
 

3227
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,069
and gave people time to process and to
think and then that made me focus my

3228
00:51:06,069 --> 00:51:06,079
think and then that made me focus my
 

3229
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:07,750
think and then that made me focus my
writing wasn't great on their chalkboard

3230
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:07,760
writing wasn't great on their chalkboard
 

3231
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,549
writing wasn't great on their chalkboard
but

3232
00:51:08,549 --> 00:51:08,559
but
 

3233
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:09,990
but
i really love that part of like the

3234
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:10,000
i really love that part of like the
 

3235
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,829
i really love that part of like the
teaching so that that entered scipy's

3236
00:51:11,829 --> 00:51:11,839
teaching so that that entered scipy's
 

3237
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:13,109
teaching so that that entered scipy's
world in terms of we always understood

3238
00:51:13,109 --> 00:51:13,119
world in terms of we always understood
 

3239
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:15,270
world in terms of we always understood
that there's a didactic aspect of sci-fi

3240
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:15,280
that there's a didactic aspect of sci-fi
 

3241
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,589
that there's a didactic aspect of sci-fi
kind of how do you take the knowledge

3242
00:51:17,589 --> 00:51:17,599
kind of how do you take the knowledge
 

3243
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:19,430
kind of how do you take the knowledge
and then produce it the challenge we had

3244
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:19,440
and then produce it the challenge we had
 

3245
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,309
and then produce it the challenge we had
was the scope like ultimately scipy was

3246
00:51:22,309 --> 00:51:22,319
was the scope like ultimately scipy was
 

3247
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:24,950
was the scope like ultimately scipy was
everything right and so 2001 when it

3248
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:24,960
everything right and so 2001 when it
 

3249
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,309
everything right and so 2001 when it
first came out people were starting to

3250
00:51:26,309 --> 00:51:26,319
first came out people were starting to
 

3251
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:28,230
first came out people were starting to
use it no this is cool this is a tool we

3252
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:28,240
use it no this is cool this is a tool we
 

3253
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,430
use it no this is cool this is a tool we
actually use

3254
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:29,440
actually use
 

3255
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,430
actually use
at the same time 2001 time frame there

3256
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:31,440
at the same time 2001 time frame there
 

3257
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,950
at the same time 2001 time frame there
was a little bit of um like the hubble

3258
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:32,960
was a little bit of um like the hubble
 

3259
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,950
was a little bit of um like the hubble
space telescope the folks at hubble has

3260
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:34,960
space telescope the folks at hubble has
 

3261
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:35,910
space telescope the folks at hubble has
started saying hey python we're gonna

3262
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:35,920
started saying hey python we're gonna
 

3263
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,829
started saying hey python we're gonna
use python for processing images from

3264
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:37,839
use python for processing images from
 

3265
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:40,150
use python for processing images from
hubble and so perry greenfield was a

3266
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:40,160
hubble and so perry greenfield was a
 

3267
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,549
hubble and so perry greenfield was a
good friend and running that program and

3268
00:51:42,549 --> 00:51:42,559
good friend and running that program and
 

3269
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:43,270
good friend and running that program and
he

3270
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:43,280
he
 

3271
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,790
he
had called me before i left to byu and

3272
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:44,800
had called me before i left to byu and
 

3273
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,990
had called me before i left to byu and
said you know

3274
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:46,000
said you know
 

3275
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,990
said you know
we want to do this but numeric actually

3276
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:48,000
we want to do this but numeric actually
 

3277
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,069
we want to do this but numeric actually
has some challenges in terms of you know

3278
00:51:50,069 --> 00:51:50,079
has some challenges in terms of you know
 

3279
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:51,349
has some challenges in terms of you know
it's not the array doesn't have enough

3280
00:51:51,349 --> 00:51:51,359
it's not the array doesn't have enough
 

3281
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:52,309
it's not the array doesn't have enough
types

3282
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:52,319
types
 

3283
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:54,309
types
uh we need more operations you know

3284
00:51:54,309 --> 00:51:54,319
uh we need more operations you know
 

3285
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:55,349
uh we need more operations you know
broadcast needs to be a little more

3286
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:55,359
broadcast needs to be a little more
 

3287
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:57,750
broadcast needs to be a little more
settled uh they wanted record arrays

3288
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:57,760
settled uh they wanted record arrays
 

3289
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,589
settled uh they wanted record arrays
they wanted you know record arrays are

3290
00:51:59,589 --> 00:51:59,599
they wanted you know record arrays are
 

3291
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:01,270
they wanted you know record arrays are
like a data frame but a little bit

3292
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:01,280
like a data frame but a little bit
 

3293
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,549
like a data frame but a little bit
different but they wanted more

3294
00:52:02,549 --> 00:52:02,559
different but they wanted more
 

3295
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:04,549
different but they wanted more
structured data so

3296
00:52:04,549 --> 00:52:04,559
structured data so
 

3297
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:05,910
structured data so
he had called me even early on then and

3298
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:05,920
he had called me even early on then and
 

3299
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:06,950
he had called me even early on then and
they said yeah hey would you want to

3300
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:06,960
they said yeah hey would you want to
 

3301
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,230
they said yeah hey would you want to
work on something to make this work i

3302
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:08,240
work on something to make this work i
 

3303
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,670
work on something to make this work i
said yeah i'm interested but i'm going

here and i you know we'll see if i have
 

3307
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,870
here and i you know we'll see if i have
time so in the meantime while i was

3308
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:12,880
time so in the meantime while i was
 

3309
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,630
time so in the meantime while i was
teaching and sci-fi was emerging and i

3310
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:14,640
teaching and sci-fi was emerging and i
 

3311
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,309
teaching and sci-fi was emerging and i
had a student i was constantly while i

3312
00:52:16,309 --> 00:52:16,319
had a student i was constantly while i
 

3313
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:17,670
had a student i was constantly while i
was teaching trying a way to fund this

3314
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:17,680
was teaching trying a way to fund this
 

3315
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,630
was teaching trying a way to fund this
stuff

3316

stuff
 

3317
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,630
stuff
so i had a graduate student uh my only

3318
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:20,640
so i had a graduate student uh my only
 

3319

a bunch of stuff for iterative iterative
linear algebra like got into writing

3328
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:30,720
linear algebra like got into writing
 

3329
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,069
linear algebra like got into writing
some of the iterative literary algebra

00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:33,760
uh tools that are currently there in
 

3333
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,910
uh tools that are currently there in
sci-fi and they've gotten better since

3334
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:35,920
sci-fi and they've gotten better since
 

3335
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,150
sci-fi and they've gotten better since
but this is in 2005.

but this is in 2005.
 

3337
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,150
but this is in 2005.
kept working on sci-fi but

3338
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:40,160
kept working on sci-fi but
 

3339
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,829
kept working on sci-fi but
perry had started working on a

3340
00:52:41,829 --> 00:52:41,839
perry had started working on a
 

3341
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:45,030
perry had started working on a
replacement to numeric called namurai

3342
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:45,040
replacement to numeric called namurai
 

3343
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,990
replacement to numeric called namurai
and in 2004 a package called in the

3344
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:48,000
and in 2004 a package called in the
 

3345
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,630
and in 2004 a package called in the
image it was an image processing library

3346
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:50,640
image it was an image processing library
 

3347
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,589
image it was an image processing library
that was written for nomare and it had

3348
00:52:53,589 --> 00:52:53,599
that was written for nomare and it had
 

3349
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,750
that was written for nomare and it had
in it a morphology tool i don't know

3350
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:55,760
in it a morphology tool i don't know
 

3351
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,910
in it a morphology tool i don't know
what morphology is it's open dilations

3352
00:52:57,910 --> 00:52:57,920
what morphology is it's open dilations
 

3353
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,589
what morphology is it's open dilations
close you know there's sort of this

3354
00:52:59,589 --> 00:52:59,599
close you know there's sort of this
 

3355
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:01,910
close you know there's sort of this
as a medical imaging student i knew what

3356
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:01,920
as a medical imaging student i knew what
 

3357
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,950
as a medical imaging student i knew what
it was because it was used in

3358
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:02,960
it was because it was used in
 

3359
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,349
it was because it was used in
segmentation a lot and in fact i wanted

3360
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:05,359
segmentation a lot and in fact i wanted
 

3361
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:07,109
segmentation a lot and in fact i wanted
to do something like that in python in

3362
00:53:07,109 --> 00:53:07,119
to do something like that in python in
 

3363
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:09,589
to do something like that in python in
scipy but just had never gotten around

3364
00:53:09,589 --> 00:53:09,599
scipy but just had never gotten around
 

3365
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,309
scipy but just had never gotten around
to it so when it came out that it worked

3366
00:53:12,309 --> 00:53:12,319
to it so when it came out that it worked
 

3367
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,069
to it so when it came out that it worked
only on the num array

3368
00:53:14,069 --> 00:53:14,079
only on the num array
 

3369
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,630
only on the num array
and scipy needed numeric and so we

3370
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:16,640
and scipy needed numeric and so we
 

3371
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,870
and scipy needed numeric and so we
effectively had the beginning of this

3372
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:18,880
effectively had the beginning of this
 

3373
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:19,829
effectively had the beginning of this
split

3374
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:19,839
split
 

3375
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:21,510
split
and numeric and number i didn't share

3376
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:21,520
and numeric and number i didn't share
 

3377
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,589
and numeric and number i didn't share
data they were just two so you could

3378
00:53:23,589 --> 00:53:23,599
data they were just two so you could
 

3379
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,190
data they were just two so you could
have a gigabyte of numeric memory data

3380
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:25,200
have a gigabyte of numeric memory data
 

3381
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,549
have a gigabyte of numeric memory data
and gigabyte of numeric data and they

3382
00:53:26,549 --> 00:53:26,559
and gigabyte of numeric data and they
 

3383
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:27,750
and gigabyte of numeric data and they
wouldn't share it yeah and so you have

3384
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:27,760
wouldn't share it yeah and so you have
 

3385
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,589
wouldn't share it yeah and so you have
these any of these scientific libraries

3386
00:53:29,589 --> 00:53:29,599
these any of these scientific libraries
 

3387
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:31,109
these any of these scientific libraries
written on top

3388
00:53:31,109 --> 00:53:31,119
written on top
 

3389
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:33,030
written on top
i got really bugged by that yeah i got

3390
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:33,040
i got really bugged by that yeah i got
 

3391
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,870
i got really bugged by that yeah i got
really like oh man this is not good

3392
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:34,880
really like oh man this is not good
 

3393
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,390
really like oh man this is not good
we're not cooperating now we're not

3394
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:36,400
we're not cooperating now we're not
 

3395
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,829
we're not cooperating now we're not
we're sort of redoing each other's work

3396
00:53:37,829 --> 00:53:37,839
we're sort of redoing each other's work
 

3397
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:40,150
we're sort of redoing each other's work
and we're just this young community

3398
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:40,160
and we're just this young community
 

3399
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,030
and we're just this young community
so that's what led me even though i knew

3400
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:43,040
so that's what led me even though i knew
 

3401
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,109
so that's what led me even though i knew
it was risky because my

3402
00:53:45,109 --> 00:53:45,119
it was risky because my
 

3403
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:46,549
it was risky because my
you know i had i was on a tenure track

3404
00:53:46,549 --> 00:53:46,559
you know i had i was on a tenure track
 

3405
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:48,630
you know i had i was on a tenure track
position 2004 i got reviewed they said

3406
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:48,640
position 2004 i got reviewed they said
 

3407
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,670
position 2004 i got reviewed they said
hey things are going okay you're doing

3408
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:49,680
hey things are going okay you're doing
 

3409
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,670
hey things are going okay you're doing
well paper's coming out but you're kind

3410
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:51,680
well paper's coming out but you're kind
 

3411
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,710
well paper's coming out but you're kind
of spending a lot of time in this open

3412
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:52,720
of spending a lot of time in this open
 

3413
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,230
of spending a lot of time in this open
source stuff maybe do a little less of

3414
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:54,240
source stuff maybe do a little less of
 

3415
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,910
source stuff maybe do a little less of
that and a little more of the paper

3416
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:55,920
that and a little more of the paper
 

3417
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,829
that and a little more of the paper
writing and grant writing which was

3418
00:53:57,829 --> 00:53:57,839
writing and grant writing which was
 

3419
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:59,670
writing and grant writing which was
naive but it was definitely the time you

3420
00:53:59,670 --> 00:53:59,680
naive but it was definitely the time you
 

3421
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,829
naive but it was definitely the time you
know the thinking it still goes on still

3422
00:54:01,829 --> 00:54:01,839
know the thinking it still goes on still
 

3423
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:03,030
know the thinking it still goes on still
goes on

3424
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:03,040
goes on
 

3425
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,270
goes on
you're basically creating a thing which

3426
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:05,280
you're basically creating a thing which
 

3427
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,230
you're basically creating a thing which
enables science in the 21st century

3428
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:08,240
enables science in the 21st century
 

3429
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,630
enables science in the 21st century
right um maybe don't emphasize that so

3430
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:10,640
right um maybe don't emphasize that so
 

3431
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,270
right um maybe don't emphasize that so
much in your for your tenure right

3432
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:13,280
much in your for your tenure right
 

3433
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,710
much in your for your tenure right
it illustrates some of the challenges

3434
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:14,720
it illustrates some of the challenges
 

3435
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,589
it illustrates some of the challenges
yeah

3436
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:15,599
yeah
 

3437
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:18,069
yeah
it does it's and it's people mean well

3438
00:54:18,069 --> 00:54:18,079
it does it's and it's people mean well
 

3439
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:20,870
it does it's and it's people mean well
yeah like but we've gotten broken in a

3440
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:20,880
yeah like but we've gotten broken in a
 

3441
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,230
yeah like but we've gotten broken in a
bunch of ways

3442
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:22,240
bunch of ways
 

3443
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,069
bunch of ways
certain things programming understanding

3444
00:54:24,069 --> 00:54:24,079
certain things programming understanding
 

3445
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:25,430
certain things programming understanding
the role of software engineering and

3446
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:25,440
the role of software engineering and
 

3447
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,349
the role of software engineering and
programming exactly society is a little

3448
00:54:27,349 --> 00:54:27,359
programming exactly society is a little
 

3449
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:28,950
programming exactly society is a little
bit less exactly no i was in electrical

3450
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:28,960
bit less exactly no i was in electrical
 

3451
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,950
bit less exactly no i was in electrical
engineering position right so it was

3452
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:30,960
engineering position right so it was
 

3453
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,150
engineering position right so it was
even worse

3454
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:32,160
even worse
 

3455
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,030
even worse
there

3456
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:33,040
there
 

3457
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,549
there
yeah it was very they were very focused

3458
00:54:34,549 --> 00:54:34,559
yeah it was very they were very focused
 

3459
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,309
yeah it was very they were very focused
and so you know good people and i had a

3460
00:54:36,309 --> 00:54:36,319
and so you know good people and i had a
 

3461
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:38,470
and so you know good people and i had a
great time i loved my time i loved my

3462
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:38,480
great time i loved my time i loved my
 

3463
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,670
great time i loved my time i loved my
teaching i loved all the things i did

3464
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:39,680
teaching i loved all the things i did
 

3465
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,069
teaching i loved all the things i did
there the problem was this split was

3466
00:54:42,069 --> 00:54:42,079
there the problem was this split was
 

3467
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:43,829
there the problem was this split was
happening in this community i loved i

3468
00:54:43,829 --> 00:54:43,839
happening in this community i loved i
 

3469
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:45,589
happening in this community i loved i
saw people and i go oh my gosh this is

3470
00:54:45,589 --> 00:54:45,599
saw people and i go oh my gosh this is
 

3471
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:46,870
saw people and i go oh my gosh this is
going to be

3472
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:46,880
going to be
 

3473
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,549
going to be
this is not great and so

3474
00:54:48,549 --> 00:54:48,559
this is not great and so
 

3475
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:50,789
this is not great and so
i happened you know fate

3476
00:54:50,789 --> 00:54:50,799
i happened you know fate
 

3477
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:52,870
i happened you know fate
i had a class i had signed up for it

3478
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:52,880
i had a class i had signed up for it
 

3479
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,390
i had a class i had signed up for it
it's a i was trying to build an mri

3480
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:54,400
it's a i was trying to build an mri
 

3481
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,710
it's a i was trying to build an mri
system so i just i had a kind of a radio

3482
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:56,720
system so i just i had a kind of a radio
 

3483
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,789
system so i just i had a kind of a radio
a instead of a radio a digital radio

3484
00:54:58,789 --> 00:54:58,799
a instead of a radio a digital radio
 

3485
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:01,270
a instead of a radio a digital radio
class as a digital mri class

3486
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:01,280
class as a digital mri class
 

3487
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,510
class as a digital mri class
uh and i had people sign up two people

3488
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:03,520
uh and i had people sign up two people
 

3489
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,870
uh and i had people sign up two people
signed up then they dropped and so i had

3490
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:04,880
signed up then they dropped and so i had
 

3491
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,549
signed up then they dropped and so i had
nobody in this class

3492
00:55:06,549 --> 00:55:06,559
nobody in this class
 

3493
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:07,349
nobody in this class
so

3494
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:07,359
so
 

3495
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:08,390
so
and i didn't have any other courses to

3496
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:08,400
and i didn't have any other courses to
 

3497
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,750
and i didn't have any other courses to
teach and i thought oh i've got some

3498
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:09,760
teach and i thought oh i've got some
 

3499
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,789
teach and i thought oh i've got some
time

3500
00:55:10,789 --> 00:55:10,799
time
 

3501
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:12,630
time
and i'll just write i'll just write a

3502
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:12,640
and i'll just write i'll just write a
 

3503
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,710
and i'll just write i'll just write a
reply a merger of the american memory

3504
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:14,720
reply a merger of the american memory
 

3505
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:15,910
reply a merger of the american memory
like i'll basically take the numeric

3506
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:15,920
like i'll basically take the numeric
 

3507
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,069
like i'll basically take the numeric
code base add the features number i was

3508
00:55:18,069 --> 00:55:18,079
code base add the features number i was
 

3509
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:19,030

adding

3510
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:19,040
adding
 

3511
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,470
adding
and then kind of come up with a single

3512
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:20,480
and then kind of come up with a single
 

3513
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,470
and then kind of come up with a single
array library that everybody can use so

3514
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:22,480
array library that everybody can use so
 

3515
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,950
array library that everybody can use so
that's where numpy came from was my

00:55:29,589 --> 00:55:29,599
been around the community long enough
 

3523
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:31,510
been around the community long enough
and i'd written enough c code i knew

3524
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:31,520
and i'd written enough c code i knew
 

3525

first contribution to numeric had been

3528
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:35,680
first contribution to numeric had been
 

3529
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,549
first contribution to numeric had been
writing the c api documentation that

3530
00:55:38,549 --> 00:55:38,559
writing the c api documentation that
 

3531
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:40,390
writing the c api documentation that
went in the first documentation for

i got credit because i wrote this

3540
00:55:46,549 --> 00:55:46,559
i got credit because i wrote this
 

3541
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:49,109
i got credit because i wrote this
chapter which is all the c api of

3542
00:55:49,109 --> 00:55:49,119
chapter which is all the c api of
 

3543
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:52,309
chapter which is all the c api of
numeric all the c stuff so i said ah i'm

probably the one to do it you know

3546
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:53,680
probably the one to do it you know
 

3547
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,870
probably the one to do it you know
nobody else is going to do this so it's

3548
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:54,880
nobody else is going to do this so it's
 

3549
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,950
nobody else is going to do this so it's
sort of out of a sense of duty and

00:56:07,589 --> 00:56:07,599
can we just
 

3565
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:09,510
can we just
link on that moment because

3566
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:09,520
link on that moment because
 

3567
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,589
link on that moment because
the importance of the way you thought

and the action you took
 

3571
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,190
and the action you took
i feel is

3572
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:15,200
i feel is
 

3573
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,030
i feel is
is understated and

3574
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:17,040
is understated and
 

3575
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,270
is understated and
is rare and i would love to see so much

3576
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:19,280
is rare and i would love to see so much
 

3577

00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:21,760
more of it because what happens as the
 

3579
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,309
more of it because what happens as the
tools become more popular

3580
00:56:24,309 --> 00:56:24,319
tools become more popular
 

3581
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:27,109
tools become more popular
uh there's a split that happens

3582
00:56:27,109 --> 00:56:27,119
uh there's a split that happens
 

3583
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:30,069
uh there's a split that happens
and it's a truly heroic and impactful

3584
00:56:30,069 --> 00:56:30,079
and it's a truly heroic and impactful
 

3585

and you it's like great leaders

3590
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:36,880
and you it's like great leaders
 

3591
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,950
and you it's like great leaders
throughout history like get what is the

3592
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:38,960
throughout history like get what is the
 

3593
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,670

make a big difference we have tensorflow

3598
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:46,960
make a big difference we have tensorflow
 

3599
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,950
make a big difference we have tensorflow
versus pytorch in the machine learning

3600
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:48,960
versus pytorch in the machine learning
 

3601
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,950
versus pytorch in the machine learning
we have the same problem today yes

3602
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:50,960
we have the same problem today yes
 

3603
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,270
we have the same problem today yes
i wonder it's actually bigger i wonder

3604
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:53,280
i wonder it's actually bigger i wonder
 

3605
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,190
i wonder it's actually bigger i wonder
if it's possible

3606
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:55,200
if it's possible
 

3607
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,150
if it's possible
to in the early days to rally the troops

3608
00:56:58,150 --> 00:56:58,160
to in the early days to rally the troops
 

3609
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,670
to in the early days to rally the troops
it is possible especially in the early

3610
00:56:59,670 --> 00:56:59,680
it is possible especially in the early
 

3611
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,430
it is possible especially in the early
days the longer it goes the harder right

3612
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:01,440
days the longer it goes the harder right
 

3613
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,950
days the longer it goes the harder right
the more energy and the factions the

3614
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:02,960
the more energy and the factions the
 

3615
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,710
the more energy and the factions the
harder but in the early days it is

3616
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:04,720
harder but in the early days it is
 

3617
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,109
harder but in the early days it is
possible and it's extremely

3618
00:57:07,109 --> 00:57:07,119
possible and it's extremely
 

3619
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:08,789
possible and it's extremely
helpful and there's a willingness there

3620
00:57:08,789 --> 00:57:08,799
helpful and there's a willingness there
 

3621
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:10,710
helpful and there's a willingness there
yeah but but but the challenge is

3622
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:10,720
yeah but but but the challenge is
 

3623
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,829
yeah but but but the challenge is
there's usually not a willingness to

3624
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:11,839
there's usually not a willingness to
 

3625
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:13,589
there's usually not a willingness to
fund it yeah there's not a willingness

3626
00:57:13,589 --> 00:57:13,599
fund it yeah there's not a willingness
 

3627

that about myself later on uh
part of my

part of my
my religious beliefs actually lead to

3661
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,109

3665
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:54,309
that's why it's what leads me to this
these attitudes sort of this hopefulness

3666
00:57:54,309 --> 00:57:54,319
these attitudes sort of this hopefulness
 

3667
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:56,950
these attitudes sort of this hopefulness
and this sense of yeah it may not it may

00:57:58,710 --> 00:57:58,720
not work out for me financially or maybe
 

3671
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,190
not work out for me financially or maybe
but that's not the ultimate gain like

3672
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:01,200
but that's not the ultimate gain like
 

3673
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,190
but that's not the ultimate gain like
that's a thing but it's not that's not

that's a thing but it's not that's not
 

3675
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,390
that's a thing but it's not that's not
the score card

3676
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:04,400
the score card
 

3677
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,549
the score card
uh for me and so i just wanted to be

3678
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:06,559
uh for me and so i just wanted to be
 

3679
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:08,069
uh for me and so i just wanted to be
helpful and i knew and partly because

3680
00:58:08,069 --> 00:58:08,079
helpful and i knew and partly because
 

3681
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:09,349
helpful and i knew and partly because
these sci-fi conferences because the

3682
00:58:09,349 --> 00:58:09,359
these sci-fi conferences because the
 

3683
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:11,270
these sci-fi conferences because the
mailing-list conversations i knew there

3684
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:11,280
mailing-list conversations i knew there
 

3685
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,950
mailing-list conversations i knew there
was a lot of need for this

3686
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:12,960
was a lot of need for this
 

3687
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,789
was a lot of need for this
right so i had this it wasn't like i was

3688
00:58:14,789 --> 00:58:14,799
right so i had this it wasn't like i was
 

3689
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:16,789
right so i had this it wasn't like i was
alone in terms of no feedback i had

3690
00:58:16,789 --> 00:58:16,799
alone in terms of no feedback i had
 

3691
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:18,150
alone in terms of no feedback i had
these people who knew

3692
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:18,160
these people who knew
 

3693
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,390
these people who knew
but it was crazy like people at the time

3694
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:20,400
but it was crazy like people at the time
 

3695
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,430
but it was crazy like people at the time
said yeah we didn't think you'd be able

3696
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:21,440
said yeah we didn't think you'd be able
 

3697
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,950
said yeah we didn't think you'd be able
to do it yeah we thought it was crazy

3698
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:22,960
to do it yeah we thought it was crazy
 

3699
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,510
to do it yeah we thought it was crazy
and also instructive like practically

3700
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:25,520
and also instructive like practically
 

3701
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,710
and also instructive like practically
speaking

3702
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:26,720
speaking
 

3703
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,870
speaking
that you had a cool feature that you

3704
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:28,880
that you had a cool feature that you
 

3705
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,109
that you had a cool feature that you
were chasing the morphology like the yes

3706
00:58:31,109 --> 00:58:31,119
were chasing the morphology like the yes
 

3707
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:32,870
were chasing the morphology like the yes
like it's it it's not either the end

3708
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:32,880
like it's it it's not either the end
 

3709
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,270
like it's it it's not either the end
result it's not some visionary thing i'm

3710
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:35,280
result it's not some visionary thing i'm
 

3711
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,270
result it's not some visionary thing i'm
going to unite the community you were

3712
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:37,280
going to unite the community you were
 

3713
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,789
going to unite the community you were
like correct you were actually

3714
00:58:38,789 --> 00:58:38,799
like correct you were actually
 

3715
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:40,390
like correct you were actually
practically this is what one person

3716
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:40,400
practically this is what one person
 

3717
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,670
practically this is what one person
actually could do

3718
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:41,680
actually could do
 

3719
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,589
actually could do
uh and actually build because that is

3720
00:58:43,589 --> 00:58:43,599
uh and actually build because that is
 

3721
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:45,670
uh and actually build because that is
important because you can get over your

3722
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:45,680
important because you can get over your
 

3723
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,349
important because you can get over your
skis yeah

3724
00:58:47,349 --> 00:58:47,359
skis yeah
 

3725
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:48,950
skis yeah
you can definitely get over your skis

and i had in fact this almost got me
 

3729
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,190
and i had in fact this almost got me
over my skis right i would say well in

important being cause there's things we

3756

did
that are still there that are

that are still there that are
 

3761
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,470
that are still there that are

problematic that created challenges for
 

3763
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,069
problematic that created challenges for
later and and i didn't know it at the

3764
00:59:22,069 --> 00:59:22,079
later and and i didn't know it at the
 

3765
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:23,430
later and and i didn't know it at the
time didn't understand how important

3766
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:23,440
time didn't understand how important
 

3767
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,589
time didn't understand how important
that was and in many cases didn't know

3768
00:59:25,589 --> 00:59:25,599
that was and in many cases didn't know
 

3769
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:27,430
that was and in many cases didn't know
what to do like there was pieces of the

3770
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:27,440
what to do like there was pieces of the
 

3771
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,349
what to do like there was pieces of the
design of nunpai i didn't know what to

3772
00:59:29,349 --> 00:59:29,359
design of nunpai i didn't know what to
 

3773
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:31,190
design of nunpai i didn't know what to
do until five years ago

3774
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:31,200
do until five years ago
 

3775
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,390
do until five years ago
now i know what they should have been

3776
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:32,400
now i know what they should have been
 

3777
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,589
now i know what they should have been
been but i didn't know at the time and

3778
00:59:33,589 --> 00:59:33,599
been but i didn't know at the time and
 

3779
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:35,270
been but i didn't know at the time and
nobody and i couldn't get the help

3780
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:35,280
nobody and i couldn't get the help
 

3781
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,670
nobody and i couldn't get the help
anyway so i wrote it it took about it

3782
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:37,680
anyway so i wrote it it took about it
 

3783
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:38,950
anyway so i wrote it it took about it
took four months to write the first

3784
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:38,960
took four months to write the first
 

3785
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,750
took four months to write the first
version then about 14 months to make it

3786
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:41,760
version then about 14 months to make it
 

3787
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,270
version then about 14 months to make it
usable

3788
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:43,280
usable
 

3789
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,109
usable
but it was it wasn't it was that first

3790
00:59:45,109 --> 00:59:45,119
but it was it wasn't it was that first
 

3791

four months of intense writing coding

3792
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:48,240
four months of intense writing coding
 

3793
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,430

getting something out the door that

3794
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:49,440
getting something out the door that
 

3795
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,390
getting something out the door that
worked

3796
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:50,400
worked
 

3797
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,670
worked
that was it was it was definitely

3798
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:51,680
that was it was it was definitely
 

3799
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,270
that was it was it was definitely
challenging and then the big thing i did

3800
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:53,280
challenging and then the big thing i did
 

3801
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,109
challenging and then the big thing i did
was create a new type object called

3802
00:59:55,109 --> 00:59:55,119
was create a new type object called
 

3803
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:57,750
was create a new type object called
d-type that was probably the

3804
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:57,760
d-type that was probably the
 

3805
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,230
d-type that was probably the
contribution and the fact that i added

3806
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:00,240
contribution and the fact that i added
 

3807
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,990
contribution and the fact that i added
uh broad not just broadcasting but

3808
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:02,000

01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,309
advanced indexing so that you could do
um masks indexing and indirect indexing

3821
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,349
narrowest sense is to have this object
that represents

n-dimensional arrays
 

3825
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,349
n-dimensional arrays
and like at any level of abstraction you

3826
01:00:25,349 --> 01:00:25,359
and like at any level of abstraction you
 

3827
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:27,750
and like at any level of abstraction you
want but basically it could be a black

3828
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:27,760
want but basically it could be a black
 

3829
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,910
want but basically it could be a black
box that you can investigate in ways

3830
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:29,920
box that you can investigate in ways
 

3831
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,109
box that you can investigate in ways
that you would naturally want to

3832
01:00:31,109 --> 01:00:31,119
that you would naturally want to
 

3833
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:33,829
that you would naturally want to
investigate yes such objects yes exactly

3834
01:00:33,829 --> 01:00:33,839
investigate yes such objects yes exactly
 

3835
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:35,910
investigate yes such objects yes exactly
so you could do math on it easily math

3836
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:35,920
so you could do math on it easily math
 

3837
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,430
so you could do math on it easily math
on it easily so you had so it had an

3838
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:37,440
on it easily so you had so it had an
 

3839
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,670
on it easily so you had so it had an
associated library of math operations

3840
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:39,680
associated library of math operations
 

3841
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,910
associated library of math operations
and effectively scipy became an even

3842
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:41,920
and effectively scipy became an even
 

3843
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,829
and effectively scipy became an even
larger upright set of

3844
01:00:43,829 --> 01:00:43,839
larger upright set of
 

3845
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:46,549
larger upright set of
math operations so the key for me was

3846
01:00:46,549 --> 01:00:46,559
math operations so the key for me was
 

3847
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,309

i was going to write numpy and then move
 

3849
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:50,230
i was going to write numpy and then move
side pi to depend on numpy

in fact early on one of the initial

3852
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:52,240
in fact early on one of the initial
 

3853
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,829
in fact early on one of the initial
proposals was that we would just write

3854
01:00:53,829 --> 01:00:53,839
proposals was that we would just write
 

3855
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:55,510
proposals was that we would just write
scipy and it would have the numeric

3856
01:00:55,510 --> 01:00:55,520
scipy and it would have the numeric
 

3857
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,309
scipy and it would have the numeric
object inside of it and it would be

3858
01:00:57,309 --> 01:00:57,319
object inside of it and it would be
 

3859
01:00:57,319 --> 01:00:59,670
object inside of it and it would be
scipy.array or something

3860
01:00:59,670 --> 01:00:59,680
scipy.array or something
 

3861
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,270
scipy.array or something
that turned out to be problematic

3862
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:01,280
that turned out to be problematic
 

3863
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,870
that turned out to be problematic
because numeric already had a little

wanted backward compatibility one of the
 

3873
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,069
wanted backward compatibility one of the
big challenges of numpy was i had to be

big challenges of numpy was i had to be
 

3875
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:15,750
big challenges of numpy was i had to be

led to the result so let's like i think
doing and this is what had no impact on

doing and this is what had no impact on
 

4073
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,549
doing and this is what had no impact on
the result like let's let's promote this

4074
01:04:22,549 --> 01:04:22,559
the result like let's let's promote this
 

4075

4106
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:53,599
another column you have to insert you
 

4107
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:54,630
another column you have to insert you
have to do all this memory movement to

4108
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:54,640
have to do all this memory movement to
 

4109
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,630
have to do all this memory movement to
insert a column whereas data frames

4110
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:56,640
insert a column whereas data frames
 

4111
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,549
insert a column whereas data frames
became oh i'm going to have a loose

4112
01:04:58,549 --> 01:04:58,559
became oh i'm going to have a loose
 

4113

collection of arrays

4114
01:05:00,309 --> 01:05:00,319
collection of arrays
 

4115
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:03,109
collection of arrays
so it's a record of arrays that is the

4116
01:05:03,109 --> 01:05:03,119
so it's a record of arrays that is the
 

4117
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:04,230
so it's a record of arrays that is the
heart of a data frame and we thought

4118
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:04,240
heart of a data frame and we thought
 

4119
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,670
heart of a data frame and we thought
about that back in the memory days but

4120
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:05,680
about that back in the memory days but
 

4121
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:06,470
about that back in the memory days but

then then also the operations that were

4126
01:05:10,789 --> 01:05:10,799
then then also the operations that were
 

4127
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:12,710
then then also the operations that were
relevant for data processing what i

relevant for data processing what i
 

4129

01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,349
between the american memory he had a
little high level tool that would just

01:05:55,349 --> 01:05:55,359
little high level tool that would just

he finally said we're going to just make

4176
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:00,880
he finally said we're going to just make
 

4177
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:03,109
he finally said we're going to just make
numpy the dependency of matplotlib

4178

numpy the dependency of matplotlib
 

4179
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:04,789
numpy the dependency of matplotlib
as soon as he did that and i remember

4180
01:06:04,789 --> 01:06:04,799
as soon as he did that and i remember
 

4181
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:06,309
as soon as he did that and i remember
specifically when he did that i said

4182
01:06:06,309 --> 01:06:06,319
specifically when he did that i said
 

4183
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:08,549
specifically when he did that i said
this okay we've done it like that was

4184
01:06:08,549 --> 01:06:08,559
this okay we've done it like that was
 

4185
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:10,789
this okay we've done it like that was
when i knew we had succeeded success

4186
01:06:10,789 --> 01:06:10,799
when i knew we had succeeded success
 

4187
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:12,870
when i knew we had succeeded success
and before then it was still you know to

4188
01:06:12,870 --> 01:06:12,880
and before then it was still you know to
 

4189
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,549
and before then it was still you know to
ensure but that kind of started a roller

4190
01:06:14,549 --> 01:06:14,559
ensure but that kind of started a roller
 

4191
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:17,750
ensure but that kind of started a roller
coaster and then 2006 to 2009

4192
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:17,760
coaster and then 2006 to 2009
 

4193
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,069
coaster and then 2006 to 2009
and then i've been floored by the by

4194
01:06:20,069 --> 01:06:20,079
and then i've been floored by the by
 

4195
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:21,829
and then i've been floored by the by
what it's done like i had i knew it

4196
01:06:21,829 --> 01:06:21,839
what it's done like i had i knew it
 

4197
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:23,829
what it's done like i had i knew it
would help i didn't have no idea how

4198
01:06:23,829 --> 01:06:23,839
would help i didn't have no idea how
 

4199
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:25,270
would help i didn't have no idea how
much it would help

4200
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:25,280
much it would help
 

4201
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,750
much it would help
right so and it has to do with again the

4202
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:27,760
right so and it has to do with again the
 

4203
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,750
right so and it has to do with again the
language thing that just people started

4204
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:29,760
language thing that just people started
 

4205
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,950
language thing that just people started
to think in terms of numpy like yes

4206
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:32,960
to think in terms of numpy like yes
 

4207
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,109
to think in terms of numpy like yes
and that opened up a whole

4208
01:06:35,109 --> 01:06:35,119
and that opened up a whole
 

4209
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:37,349
and that opened up a whole
new way of thinking and part of the

4210
01:06:37,349 --> 01:06:37,359
new way of thinking and part of the
 

4211
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:38,630
new way of thinking and part of the
story that would cut you kind of

4212
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:38,640
story that would cut you kind of
 

4213
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,230
story that would cut you kind of
mentioned but

4214
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:40,240
mentioned but
 

4215
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,069
mentioned but
maybe you can

4216
01:06:42,069 --> 01:06:42,079
maybe you can
 

4217
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:44,950
maybe you can
elaborate is it seems like at some point

4218
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:44,960
elaborate is it seems like at some point
 

4219
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,430
elaborate is it seems like at some point
in this story

4220
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:47,440
in this story
 

4221
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:50,150
in this story
python took over science and data

4222
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:50,160
python took over science and data
 

4223
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,069
python took over science and data
science yeah and

4224
01:06:52,069 --> 01:06:52,079
science yeah and
 

4225
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:54,789
science yeah and
uh not bigger than that

4226
01:06:54,789 --> 01:06:54,799
uh not bigger than that
 

4227
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:57,589
uh not bigger than that
the scientific community

4228
01:06:57,589 --> 01:06:57,599
the scientific community
 

4229
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:00,150
the scientific community
started to think like programmers or

4230
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:00,160
started to think like programmers or
 

4231
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,710
started to think like programmers or
started to utilize the tools of

4232
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:02,720
started to utilize the tools of
 

4233
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,270
started to utilize the tools of
computers to do like at a scale that

4234
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:05,280
computers to do like at a scale that
 

4235
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,510
computers to do like at a scale that
wasn't done with fortran like at this

4236
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:07,520
wasn't done with fortran like at this
 

4237
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:10,069
wasn't done with fortran like at this
gigantic scale they started to opening

4238
01:07:10,069 --> 01:07:10,079
gigantic scale they started to opening
 

4239
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:11,670
gigantic scale they started to opening
their heart and then python was the

4240
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:11,680
their heart and then python was the
 

4241
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,109
their heart and then python was the
thing i mean there's a few other

4242
01:07:13,109 --> 01:07:13,119
thing i mean there's a few other
 

4243
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:15,349
thing i mean there's a few other
competitors i guess but python i think

4244
01:07:15,349 --> 01:07:15,359
competitors i guess but python i think
 

4245
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:17,430
competitors i guess but python i think
really really took over i agree there's

4246
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:17,440
really really took over i agree there's
 

4247
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,870
really really took over i agree there's
a lot of stories here that are kind of

4248
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:18,880
a lot of stories here that are kind of
 

4249
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,230
a lot of stories here that are kind of
during this journey because this is sort

4250
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:20,240
during this journey because this is sort
 

4251
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:23,190
during this journey because this is sort
of the start of this journey in 2006.

4252
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:23,200
of the start of this journey in 2006.
 

4253
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:23,990
of the start of this journey in 2006.
so

4254
01:07:23,990 --> 01:07:24,000
so
 

4255
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,990
so
my tenure committee i applied for tenure

4256
01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:26,000
my tenure committee i applied for tenure
 

4257
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,109
my tenure committee i applied for tenure
in 2006 2007. it came back i split the

4258
01:07:29,109 --> 01:07:29,119
in 2006 2007. it came back i split the
 

4259
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:31,349
in 2006 2007. it came back i split the
department i was very polarizing i had

4260
01:07:31,349 --> 01:07:31,359
department i was very polarizing i had
 

4261
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:33,190
department i was very polarizing i had
some huge fans and then some people said

4262

01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,590
of magic
elsewhere in industry so like we need

4422
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:13,600
elsewhere in industry so like we need
 

4423
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:17,110
elsewhere in industry so like we need
that and we need that flame going and um

4424
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:17,120
that and we need that flame going and um
 

4425
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,709
that and we need that flame going and um
it's the same thing as exactly as you

4426
01:10:18,709 --> 01:10:18,719
it's the same thing as exactly as you
 

4427
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:20,390
it's the same thing as exactly as you
said it has the same kind of elements

4428
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:20,400
said it has the same kind of elements
 

4429
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:23,189
said it has the same kind of elements
like the open source community does

4430
01:10:23,189 --> 01:10:23,199
like the open source community does
 

4431
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:26,310
like the open source community does
and but then if you like the reason i

4432
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:26,320
and but then if you like the reason i
 

4433
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,070
and but then if you like the reason i
stepped away the reason i'm here just

4434
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:28,080
stepped away the reason i'm here just
 

4435
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,470
stepped away the reason i'm here just
like you did in austin is like if i want

4436
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:30,480
like you did in austin is like if i want
 

4437
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,270
like you did in austin is like if i want
to build one robot i'll stay at mit but

4438
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:33,280
to build one robot i'll stay at mit but
 

4439
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,750
to build one robot i'll stay at mit but
if i want to build millions

4440
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:35,760
if i want to build millions
 

4441
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,830
if i want to build millions
and make money enough to where i can

4442
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:37,840
and make money enough to where i can
 

4443
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,870
and make money enough to where i can
explore the magic of that then you can't

4444
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:40,880
explore the magic of that then you can't
 

4445
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,149
explore the magic of that then you can't
and i think

4446
01:10:42,149 --> 01:10:42,159
and i think
 

4447
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:44,870
and i think
that dance is um that translational

4448
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:44,880
that dance is um that translational
 

4449
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,430
that dance is um that translational
dance has been lost a bit yeah right and

4450
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:47,440
dance has been lost a bit yeah right and
 

4451
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:48,790
dance has been lost a bit yeah right and
there's a lot of reasons for that i'm

4452
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:48,800
there's a lot of reasons for that i'm
 

4453
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:49,990
there's a lot of reasons for that i'm
certainly not an expert on this stuff

4454
01:10:49,990 --> 01:10:50,000
certainly not an expert on this stuff
 

4455
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,270
certainly not an expert on this stuff
like an opinion like anybody else but i

4456
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:53,280
like an opinion like anybody else but i
 

4457
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,030
like an opinion like anybody else but i
i realized that i wanted to explore

4458
01:10:55,030 --> 01:10:55,040
i realized that i wanted to explore
 

4459
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,030
i realized that i wanted to explore
entrepreneurship which i knew and really

4460
01:10:57,030 --> 01:10:57,040
entrepreneurship which i knew and really
 

4461
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,630
entrepreneurship which i knew and really
figure out and it's been a driving

4462
01:10:58,630 --> 01:10:58,640
figure out and it's been a driving
 

4463
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,669
figure out and it's been a driving
passion for 20 years 20 25 years how do

4464
01:11:01,669 --> 01:11:01,679
passion for 20 years 20 25 years how do
 

4465
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:03,590
passion for 20 years 20 25 years how do
we connect

4466
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:03,600
we connect
 

4467
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,470
we connect
capital markets and company um because

4468
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:06,480
capital markets and company um because
 

4469
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:07,669
capital markets and company um because
again i fell in love with the notion

4470
01:11:07,669 --> 01:11:07,679
again i fell in love with the notion
 

4471
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:09,910
again i fell in love with the notion
that oh profit seeking on its own is not

4472
01:11:09,910 --> 01:11:09,920
that oh profit seeking on its own is not
 

4473
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:12,630
that oh profit seeking on its own is not
a bad thing it's actually a coordination

4474
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:12,640
a bad thing it's actually a coordination
 

4475
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:15,510
a bad thing it's actually a coordination
mechanism for allocating resources that

4476
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:15,520
mechanism for allocating resources that
 

4477
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,830
mechanism for allocating resources that
you know not in an emergent way right

4478
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:17,840
you know not in an emergent way right
 

4479
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,110
you know not in an emergent way right
that respects

4480
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:19,120
that respects
 

4481
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,950
that respects
everybody's opinions right so this is

4482
01:11:20,950 --> 01:11:20,960
everybody's opinions right so this is
 

4483
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,950
everybody's opinions right so this is
actually powerful so so

4484
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:22,960
actually powerful so so
 

4485
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,790
actually powerful so so
i i say all the time when i make a

4486
01:11:24,790 --> 01:11:24,800
i i say all the time when i make a
 

4487
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,709
i i say all the time when i make a
company and we do something that makes

4488
01:11:26,709 --> 01:11:26,719
company and we do something that makes
 

4489
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:28,070
company and we do something that makes
profit what we're saying is hey we're

4490
01:11:28,070 --> 01:11:28,080
profit what we're saying is hey we're
 

4491
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,750
profit what we're saying is hey we're
collecting of the world's resources and

4492
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:29,760
collecting of the world's resources and
 

4493
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,590
collecting of the world's resources and
voluntarily people are asking us to do

4494
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:31,600
voluntarily people are asking us to do
 

4495
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:32,790
voluntarily people are asking us to do
something they like

4496
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:32,800
something they like
 

4497
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,630
something they like
and that's a huge deal and so i really

4498
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:34,640
and that's a huge deal and so i really
 

4499
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:36,630
and that's a huge deal and so i really
like that energy so that's what i came

4500
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:36,640
like that energy so that's what i came
 

4501
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,149
like that energy so that's what i came
to do and to learn and to try to figure

4502
01:11:38,149 --> 01:11:38,159
to do and to learn and to try to figure
 

4503
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:39,270
to do and to learn and to try to figure
out and that's what i've been kind of

4504
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:39,280
out and that's what i've been kind of
 

4505
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,870
out and that's what i've been kind of
stumbling through since for the past 14

4506
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:40,880
stumbling through since for the past 14
 

4507
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:44,790
stumbling through since for the past 14
years 2007 2007. so you were still

4508
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:44,800
years 2007 2007. so you were still
 

4509
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,669
years 2007 2007. so you were still
so no i was just emerging just right

4510
01:11:47,669 --> 01:11:47,679
so no i was just emerging just right
 

4511
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:49,510
so no i was just emerging just right
one thing i've done i've done it's worth

4512
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:49,520
one thing i've done i've done it's worth
 

4513
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,870
one thing i've done i've done it's worth
mentioning because it

4514
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:50,880
mentioning because it
 

4515
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,550
mentioning because it
emphasized the exploratory nature of my

4516
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:52,560
emphasized the exploratory nature of my
 

4517
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,229
emphasized the exploratory nature of my
thinking at the time i said well i don't

4518
01:11:54,229 --> 01:11:54,239
thinking at the time i said well i don't
 

4519
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:55,350
thinking at the time i said well i don't
know how to fund this thing i've got a

4520
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:55,360
know how to fund this thing i've got a
 

4521
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,790
know how to fund this thing i've got a
graduate student i'm paying for and i

4522
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:56,800
graduate student i'm paying for and i
 

4523
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,550
graduate student i'm paying for and i
got no funding for him and i had done

4524
01:11:58,550 --> 01:11:58,560
got no funding for him and i had done
 

4525
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,630
got no funding for him and i had done
some fundraising from the public to try

4526
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:00,640
some fundraising from the public to try
 

4527
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,630
some fundraising from the public to try
to get public fundraiser for my lab

4528
01:12:02,630 --> 01:12:02,640
to get public fundraiser for my lab
 

4529
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:03,990
to get public fundraiser for my lab
i didn't really want to go out and just

4530
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:04,000
i didn't really want to go out and just
 

4531
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,669
i didn't really want to go out and just
do the fundraising circuit the way it's

4532
01:12:05,669 --> 01:12:05,679
do the fundraising circuit the way it's
 

4533
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:06,870
do the fundraising circuit the way it's
traditionally done

4534
01:12:06,870 --> 01:12:06,880
traditionally done
 

4535
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,110
traditionally done
so i wrote a book and i said i'm going

4536
01:12:09,110 --> 01:12:09,120
so i wrote a book and i said i'm going
 

4537
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:10,390
so i wrote a book and i said i'm going
to write a book and i'm going to charge

4538
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:10,400
to write a book and i'm going to charge
 

4539
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,630
to write a book and i'm going to charge
for it it was called guide to numpy and

4540
01:12:12,630 --> 01:12:12,640
for it it was called guide to numpy and
 

4541
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,630
for it it was called guide to numpy and
so ultimately numpy became documentation

4542
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:14,640
so ultimately numpy became documentation
 

4543
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,470
so ultimately numpy became documentation
driven development because i basically

4544
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:16,480
driven development because i basically
 

4545
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:17,990
driven development because i basically
wrote the book and made sure the stuff

4546
01:12:17,990 --> 01:12:18,000
wrote the book and made sure the stuff
 

4547
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,669
wrote the book and made sure the stuff
worked to the book would work

4548
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:19,679
worked to the book would work
 

4549
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:22,149
worked to the book would work
so it really helped actually make numpy

4550
01:12:22,149 --> 01:12:22,159
so it really helped actually make numpy
 

4551
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:24,630
so it really helped actually make numpy
become a thing so that doc writing that

4552
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:24,640
become a thing so that doc writing that
 

4553
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:25,590
become a thing so that doc writing that
book

4554
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:25,600
book
 

4555
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,270
book
and it was not a i mean it's not a page

4556
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:27,280
and it was not a i mean it's not a page
 

4557
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,189
and it was not a i mean it's not a page
turner i mean kind of not a book you

4558
01:12:29,189 --> 01:12:29,199
turner i mean kind of not a book you
 

4559
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:30,790
turner i mean kind of not a book you
pick up and go oh this is great over the

4560
01:12:30,790 --> 01:12:30,800
pick up and go oh this is great over the
 

4561
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,550
pick up and go oh this is great over the
fire but it was it's where you could

4562
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:32,560
fire but it was it's where you could
 

4563
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,229
fire but it was it's where you could
find the details like how'd all this

4564
01:12:34,229 --> 01:12:34,239
find the details like how'd all this
 

4565
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:36,390
find the details like how'd all this
work and a lot of people love that book

4566
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:36,400
work and a lot of people love that book
 

4567
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,630
work and a lot of people love that book
and so a lot of people end up so i but i

4571
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:41,350
said look i i need to so i'm going to
charge for it

4572
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:41,360
charge for it
 

4573
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,790
charge for it

amount because
you know a year and a half later i was

4728
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:04,640
you know a year and a half later i was
 

4729
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:06,310
you know a year and a half later i was
at m thought i had left academias at m

4730
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:06,320
at m thought i had left academias at m
 

4731
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,430
at m thought i had left academias at m
thought and i kind of had a full-time

4732
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:07,440
thought and i kind of had a full-time
 

4733
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,709
thought and i kind of had a full-time
job and then actually what happened is

4734
01:15:08,709 --> 01:15:08,719
job and then actually what happened is
 

4735
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:10,229
job and then actually what happened is
the documentation people there's a group

4736
01:15:10,229 --> 01:15:10,239
the documentation people there's a group
 

4737
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:11,910
the documentation people there's a group
that said hey we wanna do documentation

4738
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:11,920
that said hey we wanna do documentation
 

4739
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:14,390
that said hey we wanna do documentation
for scipy as a collective and they're

4740
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:14,400
for scipy as a collective and they're
 

4741
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,830
for scipy as a collective and they're
essentially

4742
01:15:15,830 --> 01:15:15,840
essentially
 

4743
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:18,550
essentially
needing the stuff in the book right and

4744
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:18,560
needing the stuff in the book right and
 

4745
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,430
needing the stuff in the book right and
and so

4746
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:19,440
and so
 

4747
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,030
and so
they kind of ask hey can we just use the

4748
01:15:21,030 --> 01:15:21,040
they kind of ask hey can we just use the
 

4749
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,229
they kind of ask hey can we just use the
stuff in your book and at that point

4750
01:15:22,229 --> 01:15:22,239
stuff in your book and at that point
 

4751
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:25,590
stuff in your book and at that point
said yeah i'll just open it up so that's

4752
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:25,600
said yeah i'll just open it up so that's
 

4753
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,830
said yeah i'll just open it up so that's
but it has served his purpose in the

4754
01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:27,840
but it has served his purpose in the
 

4755
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,669
but it has served his purpose in the
money that i made actually funded my

4756
01:15:29,669 --> 01:15:29,679
money that i made actually funded my
 

4757
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:31,830
money that i made actually funded my
grad student like it was actually you

4758
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:31,840
grad student like it was actually you
 

4759
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:34,149
grad student like it was actually you
know i paid him 25 000 a year

4760
01:15:34,149 --> 01:15:34,159
know i paid him 25 000 a year
 

4761
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:35,910
know i paid him 25 000 a year
uh out of that money the funny thing is

4762
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:35,920
uh out of that money the funny thing is
 

4763
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,510
uh out of that money the funny thing is
if you do very similar kind of

4764
01:15:37,510 --> 01:15:37,520
if you do very similar kind of
 

4765
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,669
if you do very similar kind of
experiment now with numpy or something

4766
01:15:39,669 --> 01:15:39,679
experiment now with numpy or something
 

4767
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:41,830
experiment now with numpy or something
like it you could probably make a lot

4768
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:41,840
like it you could probably make a lot
 

4769
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:43,669
like it you could probably make a lot
more it's probably true

4770
01:15:43,669 --> 01:15:43,679
more it's probably true
 

4771
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:45,669
more it's probably true
because of the tooling and the community

4772
01:15:45,669 --> 01:15:45,679
because of the tooling and the community
 

4773
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:47,590
because of the tooling and the community
building yeah i agree like the and

4774
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:47,600
building yeah i agree like the and
 

4775
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,590
building yeah i agree like the and
social media there there's just a

4776
01:15:49,590 --> 01:15:49,600
social media there there's just a
 

4777
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,669
social media there there's just a
virality to that kind of idea i agree

4778
01:15:51,669 --> 01:15:51,679
virality to that kind of idea i agree
 

4779
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,950
virality to that kind of idea i agree
there'd be things to do i've thought

4780
01:15:52,950 --> 01:15:52,960
there'd be things to do i've thought
 

4781
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,630
there'd be things to do i've thought
about that but and really had thought

4782
01:15:54,630 --> 01:15:54,640
about that but and really had thought
 

4783
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,390
about that but and really had thought
about a couple of books or a couple of

4784
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:56,400
about a couple of books or a couple of
 

4785
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,430
about a couple of books or a couple of
things that could be done there and i

4786
01:15:57,430 --> 01:15:57,440
things that could be done there and i
 

4787
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:58,149
things that could be done there and i
just

4788
01:15:58,149 --> 01:15:58,159
just
 

4789
01:15:58,159 --> 01:15:59,590
just
haven't right even

4790
01:15:59,590 --> 01:15:59,600
haven't right even
 

4791
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,110
haven't right even
i tried to hire a ghostwriter this week

4792
01:16:01,110 --> 01:16:01,120
i tried to hire a ghostwriter this week
 

4793
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:02,630
i tried to hire a ghostwriter this week
this year too to speak effect would help

4794
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:02,640
this year too to speak effect would help
 

4795
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,870
this year too to speak effect would help
but it it didn't

4796
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:04,880
but it it didn't
 

4797
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,630
but it it didn't
part of my problem is this i've been so

4798
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:06,640
part of my problem is this i've been so
 

4799
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,470
part of my problem is this i've been so
excited by a number of things that steps

4800
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:08,480
excited by a number of things that steps
 

4801
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,709
excited by a number of things that steps
in from that like so i came here worked

4802
01:16:10,709 --> 01:16:10,719
in from that like so i came here worked
 

4803
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:13,350
in from that like so i came here worked
at nthot for four years uh graciously

4804
01:16:13,350 --> 01:16:13,360
at nthot for four years uh graciously
 

4805
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,030
at nthot for four years uh graciously
you know eric made me president and we

he didn't like the fact that i that

4822
01:16:29,669 --> 01:16:29,679
he didn't like the fact that i that
 

4823
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:31,669
he didn't like the fact that i that
peter and i started anaconda right that

4824
01:16:31,669 --> 01:16:31,679
peter and i started anaconda right that
 

4825
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:33,350
peter and i started anaconda right that
was not i mean

4826
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:33,360
was not i mean
 

4827
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,750

that's the story of great minds building

4840
01:16:49,910 --> 01:16:49,920
that's the story of great minds building
 

4841
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,310
that's the story of great minds building
great companies yeah somehow it's sad

4842
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:52,320
great companies yeah somehow it's sad
 

4843
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,950
great companies yeah somehow it's sad
that um yeah when there's that kind of

4844
01:16:54,950 --> 01:16:54,960
that um yeah when there's that kind of
 

4845
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:55,590
that um yeah when there's that kind of
and

4846

and
 

4847
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,669
and
i i i hold him in a steam i'm grateful

4848

for him i think he's they're doing you
 

4851
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,310
for him i think he's they're doing you
know their thoughts still exist they're

4852
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:00,320
know their thoughts still exist they're
 

4853
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,390
know their thoughts still exist they're
doing great work uh helping scientists

4854
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:02,400
doing great work uh helping scientists
 

4855
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,870
doing great work uh helping scientists
they still run the scipy conference

4856
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:04,880
they still run the scipy conference
 

4857
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,390
they still run the scipy conference
they're in they have an r d platform

4858
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:06,400
they're in they have an r d platform
 

4859
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,630
they're in they have an r d platform
they're selling now that's a a tool that

4860
01:17:08,630 --> 01:17:08,640
they're selling now that's a a tool that
 

4861
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:10,709
they're selling now that's a a tool that
you can go get today right so

4862
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:10,719
you can go get today right so
 

4863
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:12,149
you can go get today right so
um they've been

4864
01:17:12,149 --> 01:17:12,159
um they've been
 

4865
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:14,709
um they've been
thought has played a role in the scipy

4866
01:17:14,709 --> 01:17:14,719
thought has played a role in the scipy
 

4867
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:16,550
thought has played a role in the scipy
in in supporting the community around

4868
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:16,560
in in supporting the community around
 

4869
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,870
in in supporting the community around
sci-fi i would say they ended up not

4870
01:17:18,870 --> 01:17:18,880
sci-fi i would say they ended up not
 

4871
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,470
sci-fi i would say they ended up not
being able to

4872
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:20,480
being able to
 

4873
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,070
being able to
they ended up building a tool suite to

4874
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:22,080
they ended up building a tool suite to
 

4875
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:24,470
they ended up building a tool suite to
write gui applications like that's where

4876
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:24,480
write gui applications like that's where
 

4877
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:25,590
write gui applications like that's where
they could actually make that the

4878
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:25,600
they could actually make that the
 

4879
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,430
they could actually make that the
business could work and so this

4880
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:27,440
business could work and so this
 

4881
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,750
business could work and so this
supporting scipy and numpy itself wasn't

4882
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:29,760
supporting scipy and numpy itself wasn't
 

4883
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,830
supporting scipy and numpy itself wasn't
as possible like they didn't they tried

4884
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:31,840
as possible like they didn't they tried
 

4885
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,189
as possible like they didn't they tried
i mean it was not just because it was

4886
01:17:33,189 --> 01:17:33,199
i mean it was not just because it was
 

4887
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:35,110
i mean it was not just because it was
just because the business aspect so and

4888
01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:35,120
just because the business aspect so and
 

4889
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,390
just because the business aspect so and
i wanted to build a company that could

4890
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:36,400
i wanted to build a company that could
 

4891
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,470
i wanted to build a company that could
do that could get venture funding

4892
01:17:38,470 --> 01:17:38,480
do that could get venture funding
 

4893
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,310
do that could get venture funding
right better for worse i mean that's a

4894
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:40,320
right better for worse i mean that's a
 

4895
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:41,669
right better for worse i mean that's a
longer story we could talk a lot about

4896
01:17:41,669 --> 01:17:41,679
longer story we could talk a lot about
 

4897
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:43,350
longer story we could talk a lot about
that but and that's that's where

4898
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:43,360
that but and that's that's where
 

4899
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,110
that but and that's that's where
anaconda came that's renaconic in it so

4900
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:45,120
anaconda came that's renaconic in it so
 

4901
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,189
anaconda came that's renaconic in it so
let me let me ask you it's it's a little

4902
01:17:47,189 --> 01:17:47,199
let me let me ask you it's it's a little
 

4903
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:48,870
let me let me ask you it's it's a little
bit for fun because you built this

4904
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:48,880
bit for fun because you built this
 

4905
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:51,510
bit for fun because you built this
amazing thing and so let's

4906
01:17:51,510 --> 01:17:51,520
amazing thing and so let's
 

4907
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,550
amazing thing and so let's
let's talk about uh like an old warrior

4908
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:54,560
let's talk about uh like an old warrior
 

4909
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,550
let's talk about uh like an old warrior
looking over old battles

4910
01:17:56,550 --> 01:17:56,560
looking over old battles
 

4911
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:00,070
looking over old battles
um you've you know there's a sad

4912
01:18:00,070 --> 01:18:00,080
um you've you know there's a sad
 

4913
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:03,030
um you've you know there's a sad
letter in 2012 that you wrote uh to the

4914
01:18:03,030 --> 01:18:03,040
letter in 2012 that you wrote uh to the
 

4915
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,790
letter in 2012 that you wrote uh to the
numpy mailing list announcing that

4916
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:04,800
numpy mailing list announcing that
 

4917
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,709
numpy mailing list announcing that
you're leaving numpy yeah and what some

4918
01:18:06,709 --> 01:18:06,719
you're leaving numpy yeah and what some
 

4919
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:08,550
you're leaving numpy yeah and what some
of the things you've listed

4920
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:08,560
of the things you've listed
 

4921
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,709
of the things you've listed
some some of the things you regret or

4922
01:18:10,709 --> 01:18:10,719
some some of the things you regret or
 

4923
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:12,870
some some of the things you regret or
not regret necessarily but some things

4924
01:18:12,870 --> 01:18:12,880
not regret necessarily but some things
 

4925
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,310
not regret necessarily but some things
to think about

4926
01:18:14,310 --> 01:18:14,320
to think about
 

4927
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,229
to think about
if you could go back and you could fix

4928
01:18:16,229 --> 01:18:16,239
if you could go back and you could fix
 

4929
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:18,550
if you could go back and you could fix
stuff about numpy or

4930
01:18:18,550 --> 01:18:18,560
stuff about numpy or
 

4931
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,630
stuff about numpy or
both sort of in a personal level but

4932
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:20,640
both sort of in a personal level but
 

4933
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,229
both sort of in a personal level but
also like looking forward what kind of

4934
01:18:22,229 --> 01:18:22,239
also like looking forward what kind of
 

4935
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:24,390
also like looking forward what kind of
things would you like to see changed

4936
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:24,400
things would you like to see changed
 

4937
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:25,430
things would you like to see changed
good question so i think there's

4938
01:18:25,430 --> 01:18:25,440
good question so i think there's
 

4939
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,350
good question so i think there's
technical questions and social questions

4940
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:27,360
technical questions and social questions
 

4941
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:29,590
technical questions and social questions
right there um

4942
01:18:29,590 --> 01:18:29,600
right there um
 

4943
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,990
right there um
first of all you know i wrote numpy as a

4944
01:18:31,990 --> 01:18:32,000
first of all you know i wrote numpy as a
 

4945
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,270
first of all you know i wrote numpy as a
service

4946
01:18:33,270 --> 01:18:33,280
service
 

4947
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:34,870
service
and i spent a lot of time doing it and

4948
01:18:34,870 --> 01:18:34,880
and i spent a lot of time doing it and
 

4949
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:35,990
and i spent a lot of time doing it and
then other people came help make it

4950
01:18:35,990 --> 01:18:36,000
then other people came help make it
 

4951
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,229
then other people came help make it
happen numpy succeeded because the work

4952
01:18:38,229 --> 01:18:38,239
happen numpy succeeded because the work
 

4953
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:40,229
happen numpy succeeded because the work
of a lot of people right so it's

4954
01:18:40,229 --> 01:18:40,239
of a lot of people right so it's
 

4955
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:42,070
of a lot of people right so it's
important to understand that

4956
01:18:42,070 --> 01:18:42,080
important to understand that
 

4957
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,830
important to understand that
i'm grateful for the opportunity the

4958
01:18:43,830 --> 01:18:43,840
i'm grateful for the opportunity the
 

4959
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,430
i'm grateful for the opportunity the
role i had i could play and grateful

4960
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:45,440
role i had i could play and grateful
 

4961
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,350
role i had i could play and grateful
that things i did had an impact

4962
01:18:47,350 --> 01:18:47,360
that things i did had an impact
 

4963
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,030
that things i did had an impact
but they only had the impact they had

4964
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:49,040
but they only had the impact they had
 

4965
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,030
but they only had the impact they had
because the other people that came to

4966
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:51,040
because the other people that came to
 

4967
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,910
because the other people that came to
the story and so they were essential but

4968
01:18:53,910 --> 01:18:53,920
the story and so they were essential but
 

4969
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,830
the story and so they were essential but
the way data types were handled the way

4970
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:55,840
the way data types were handled the way
 

4971
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,669
the way data types were handled the way
data types we had array scalers for

4972
01:18:57,669 --> 01:18:57,679
data types we had array scalers for
 

4973
01:18:57,679 --> 01:18:58,870
data types we had array scalers for
example

4974
01:18:58,870 --> 01:18:58,880
example
 

4975
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:01,590
example
that that are really just an um a

4976
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:01,600
that that are really just an um a
 

4977
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,750
that that are really just an um a
substitute for a type concept

4978
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:03,760
substitute for a type concept
 

4979
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:04,950
substitute for a type concept
right so we had

4980
01:19:04,950 --> 01:19:04,960
right so we had
 

4981
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,790
right so we had
array scalers are actual python objects

4982
01:19:06,790 --> 01:19:06,800
array scalers are actual python objects
 

4983
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,950
array scalers are actual python objects
so that there's for every for a 32-bit

4984
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:08,960
so that there's for every for a 32-bit
 

4985
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:11,750
so that there's for every for a 32-bit
float or a 16-bit float or a 16-bit

4986
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:11,760
float or a 16-bit float or a 16-bit
 

4987
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:12,950
float or a 16-bit float or a 16-bit
integer

4988
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:12,960
integer
 

4989
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,790
integer
python doesn't have a natural it's just

4990
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:14,800
python doesn't have a natural it's just
 

4991
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,189
python doesn't have a natural it's just
as one integer there's one float well

4992
01:19:17,189 --> 01:19:17,199
as one integer there's one float well
 

4993
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:18,790
as one integer there's one float well
what about these

4994
01:19:18,790 --> 01:19:18,800
what about these
 

4995
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,149
what about these
lower precision types these larger

4996
01:19:20,149 --> 01:19:20,159
lower precision types these larger
 

4997
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:21,430
lower precision types these larger
precision types

4998
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:21,440
precision types
 

4999
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:23,510
precision types
so we had them in numpy

5000
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:23,520
so we had them in numpy
 

5001
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,950
so we had them in numpy
so that you could have a collection of

5002
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:24,960
so that you could have a collection of
 

5003
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,630
so that you could have a collection of
them but then have an object in python

5004
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:26,640
them but then have an object in python
 

5005
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,550
them but then have an object in python
that was one of them

5006
01:19:28,550 --> 01:19:28,560
that was one of them
 

5007
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,709
that was one of them
and there's questions about like in

5008
01:19:30,709 --> 01:19:30,719
and there's questions about like in
 

5009
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:32,709
and there's questions about like in
retrospect i wouldn't have created those

5010
01:19:32,709 --> 01:19:32,719
retrospect i wouldn't have created those
 

5011
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:34,709
retrospect i wouldn't have created those
of an improved the type system

5012
01:19:34,709 --> 01:19:34,719
of an improved the type system
 

5013
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:36,709
of an improved the type system
and like made the type system actually a

5014
01:19:36,709 --> 01:19:36,719
and like made the type system actually a
 

5015
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:38,550
and like made the type system actually a
python type system as opposed to

5016
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:38,560
python type system as opposed to
 

5017
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,870
python type system as opposed to
currently it's a python one level type

5018
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:40,880
currently it's a python one level type
 

5019
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:41,830
currently it's a python one level type
system i don't know if you know the

5020
01:19:41,830 --> 01:19:41,840
system i don't know if you know the
 

5021
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,110
system i don't know if you know the
difference between python one python two

5022
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:43,120
difference between python one python two
 

5023
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:45,110
difference between python one python two
it's kind of technical kind of depth but

5024
01:19:45,110 --> 01:19:45,120
it's kind of technical kind of depth but
 

5025
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,630
it's kind of technical kind of depth but
python two one of its big things that

5026
01:19:46,630 --> 01:19:46,640
python two one of its big things that
 

5027
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:48,070
python two one of its big things that
guido did it was really brilliant it was

5028
01:19:48,070 --> 01:19:48,080
guido did it was really brilliant it was
 

5029
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:50,070
guido did it was really brilliant it was
he actually

5030
01:19:50,070 --> 01:19:50,080
he actually
 

5031
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,510
he actually
python one

5032
01:19:51,510 --> 01:19:51,520
python one
 

5033
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,870
python one
all classes new objects were where one

5034
01:19:54,870 --> 01:19:54,880
all classes new objects were where one
 

5035
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:57,189
all classes new objects were where one
if you as a user wrote a class it was an

5036
01:19:57,189 --> 01:19:57,199
if you as a user wrote a class it was an
 

5037
01:19:57,199 --> 01:19:59,669
if you as a user wrote a class it was an
instance of a single python type called

the ob called the class type
 

5041
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,510
the ob called the class type
right in python 2

write classes that are new types
so it's able to have your user classes

5050
01:20:12,229 --> 01:20:12,239
so it's able to have your user classes
 

5051
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:13,990
so it's able to have your user classes
be actual types and the python type

be actual types and the python type
system got a lot more rich

5054
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:16,320
system got a lot more rich
 

5055
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,149
system got a lot more rich
i barely understood that at the time

5056
01:20:18,149 --> 01:20:18,159
i barely understood that at the time
 

5057
01:20:18,159 --> 01:20:19,350
i barely understood that at the time
that numpy was written and so i

5058
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:19,360
that numpy was written and so i
 

5059
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,750
that numpy was written and so i
essentially in python numpy created a

5060
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:21,760
essentially in python numpy created a
 

5061
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,229
essentially in python numpy created a
type system that was python one era

5062
01:20:24,229 --> 01:20:24,239
type system that was python one era
 

5063
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:25,910
type system that was python one era
it was every

5064
01:20:25,910 --> 01:20:25,920
it was every
 

5065
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:28,470
it was every
every d type is an instance of the same

every d type is an instance of the same
 

5067
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:31,750
every d type is an instance of the same
type as opposed to having new d types be

type as opposed to having new d types be
 

5069
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,510

really just python types with additional
 

5071
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,590
really just python types with additional
metadata what's the cost of that is it

5072
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:35,600
metadata what's the cost of that is it
 

5073
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,189
metadata what's the cost of that is it
efficiency is a usability uh it's

5074
01:20:37,189 --> 01:20:37,199
efficiency is a usability uh it's
 

5075
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:39,430
efficiency is a usability uh it's
usability primarily the cost isn't

5076
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:39,440
usability primarily the cost isn't
 

5077
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:41,430
usability primarily the cost isn't
really efficiency it's it's it's the

5078
01:20:41,430 --> 01:20:41,440
really efficiency it's it's it's the
 

5079
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:43,590
really efficiency it's it's it's the
fact that it's clumsy to create new

5080
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:43,600
fact that it's clumsy to create new
 

5081
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:44,709
fact that it's clumsy to create new
types

5082
01:20:44,709 --> 01:20:44,719
types
 

5083
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:46,870
types
uh it's hard and then one of the

5084
01:20:46,870 --> 01:20:46,880
uh it's hard and then one of the
 

5085
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,229
uh it's hard and then one of the
challenges you want to create new types

5086
01:20:48,229 --> 01:20:48,239
challenges you want to create new types
 

5087
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:49,750
challenges you want to create new types
you want a quaternion type or you want

5088
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:49,760
you want a quaternion type or you want
 

5089
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:52,550
you want a quaternion type or you want
to uh add a new you know posit type or

5090
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:52,560
to uh add a new you know posit type or
 

5091
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,590
to uh add a new you know posit type or
you want to um so it's hard now in the

5092
01:20:55,590 --> 01:20:55,600
you want to um so it's hard now in the
 

5093
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,030
you want to um so it's hard now in the
and and now

5094
01:20:57,030 --> 01:20:57,040
and and now
 

5095
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:59,030
and and now
if we had done that well

5096
01:20:59,030 --> 01:20:59,040
if we had done that well
 

5097
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,470
if we had done that well
when number came on the scene where we

5098
01:21:00,470 --> 01:21:00,480
when number came on the scene where we
 

5099
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,790
when number came on the scene where we
could actually compile python code it

5100
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:02,800
could actually compile python code it
 

5101
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,310
could actually compile python code it
would integrate with that type system

5102
01:21:04,310 --> 01:21:04,320
would integrate with that type system
 

5103
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:05,910
would integrate with that type system
much cleaner and now all of a sudden you

5104
01:21:05,910 --> 01:21:05,920
much cleaner and now all of a sudden you
 

5105
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:06,790
much cleaner and now all of a sudden you
could

5106
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:06,800
could
 

5107
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,629
could
do gradual typing more easily you could

5108
01:21:08,629 --> 01:21:08,639
do gradual typing more easily you could
 

5109
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:10,470
do gradual typing more easily you could
actually have python when you add number

5110
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:10,480
actually have python when you add number
 

5111
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:13,510
actually have python when you add number
plus better typing could actually be a

5112
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:13,520
plus better typing could actually be a
 

5113
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:14,709
plus better typing could actually be a
uh

5114
01:21:14,709 --> 01:21:14,719
uh
 

5115
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:17,030
uh
you'd smooth out a lot of rough edges

5116
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:17,040
you'd smooth out a lot of rough edges
 

5117
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,189
you'd smooth out a lot of rough edges
but there's already there's like but are

5118
01:21:19,189 --> 01:21:19,199
but there's already there's like but are
 

5119
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:20,870
but there's already there's like but are
you talking about from the perspective

5120
01:21:20,870 --> 01:21:20,880
you talking about from the perspective
 

5121
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:23,350
you talking about from the perspective
of developers within numpy or users and

5122
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:23,360
of developers within numpy or users and
 

5123
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,590
of developers within numpy or users and
not buy because developers have new not

5124
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:25,600
not buy because developers have new not
 

5125
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,350
not buy because developers have new not
really users of numpy so much it's the

5126
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:27,360
really users of numpy so much it's the
 

5127
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:29,189
really users of numpy so much it's the
development of numpy so you're thinking

5128
01:21:29,189 --> 01:21:29,199
development of numpy so you're thinking
 

5129
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:30,390
development of numpy so you're thinking
about like

5130
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:30,400
about like
 

5131
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,709
about like
how to design numpy so that it's

5132
01:21:32,709 --> 01:21:32,719
how to design numpy so that it's
 

5133
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:35,030
how to design numpy so that it's
contributors yeah the contributors are

5134
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:35,040
contributors yeah the contributors are
 

5135
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,110
contributors yeah the contributors are
it's easier it's easier it's less work

5136
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:37,120
it's easier it's easier it's less work
 

5137
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:38,629
it's easier it's easier it's less work
to make it better and to keep it

5138
01:21:38,629 --> 01:21:38,639
to make it better and to keep it
 

5139
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:40,629
to make it better and to keep it
maintained and and where that's impacted

5140
01:21:40,629 --> 01:21:40,639
maintained and and where that's impacted
 

5141
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:42,629
maintained and and where that's impacted
things for example is

5142
01:21:42,629 --> 01:21:42,639
things for example is
 

5143
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:44,470
things for example is
the gpu like all of a sudden gpus start

5144
01:21:44,470 --> 01:21:44,480
the gpu like all of a sudden gpus start
 

5145
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,629
the gpu like all of a sudden gpus start
getting added and

5146
01:21:46,629 --> 01:21:46,639
getting added and
 

5147
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:48,790
getting added and
we don't have them in numpy like numpy

5148
01:21:48,790 --> 01:21:48,800
we don't have them in numpy like numpy
 

5149
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,790
we don't have them in numpy like numpy
should just work on gpus right the fact

5150
01:21:50,790 --> 01:21:50,800
should just work on gpus right the fact
 

5151
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,070
should just work on gpus right the fact
that we have to have to download a whole

5152
01:21:52,070 --> 01:21:52,080
that we have to have to download a whole
 

5153
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,070
that we have to have to download a whole
other object called kupai to have arrays

5154
01:21:54,070 --> 01:21:54,080
other object called kupai to have arrays
 

5155
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:56,790
other object called kupai to have arrays
on gpus is just an artifact of

5156
01:21:56,790 --> 01:21:56,800
on gpus is just an artifact of
 

5157
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,550
on gpus is just an artifact of
history because there's no fundamental

5158
01:21:58,550 --> 01:21:58,560
history because there's no fundamental
 

5159
01:21:58,560 --> 01:21:59,750
history because there's no fundamental
reason for it well that's really

5160
01:21:59,750 --> 01:21:59,760
reason for it well that's really
 

5161
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,350
reason for it well that's really
interesting if we could sort of go on

5162
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:01,360
interesting if we could sort of go on
 

5163
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:03,350
interesting if we could sort of go on
that tangent briefly is

5164
01:22:03,350 --> 01:22:03,360
that tangent briefly is
 

5165
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:04,310
that tangent briefly is
you have

5166
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:04,320
you have
 

5167
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,550
you have
pi torch and other

5168
01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:06,560
pi torch and other
 

5169
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:08,390
pi torch and other
library like tensorflow that basically

5170
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:08,400
library like tensorflow that basically
 

5171
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:11,830
library like tensorflow that basically
tried to mimic uh yeah

5172
01:22:11,830 --> 01:22:11,840
tried to mimic uh yeah
 

5173
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,629
tried to mimic uh yeah
like you've created a sort of platonic

5174
01:22:14,629 --> 01:22:14,639
like you've created a sort of platonic
 

5175
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:15,750
like you've created a sort of platonic
form

5176
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:15,760
form
 

5177
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:16,870
form
basically

5178
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:16,880
basically
 

5179
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,390
basically
yeah exactly well the problem was they

5180
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:18,400
yeah exactly well the problem was they
 

5181
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,070
yeah exactly well the problem was they
didn't realize that yeah the platonic

5182
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:20,080
didn't realize that yeah the platonic
 

5183
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:22,149
didn't realize that yeah the platonic
form has a lot of edges they're like

5184
01:22:22,149 --> 01:22:22,159
form has a lot of edges they're like
 

5185
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:23,590
form has a lot of edges they're like
well we should cut those out before we

5186
01:22:23,590 --> 01:22:23,600
well we should cut those out before we
 

5187
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,990
well we should cut those out before we
present it so i i wonder if you can

5188
01:22:25,990 --> 01:22:26,000
present it so i i wonder if you can
 

5189
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,070
present it so i i wonder if you can
comment is there like a difference

5190
01:22:28,070 --> 01:22:28,080
comment is there like a difference
 

5191
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,430
comment is there like a difference
between their implementations do you

5192
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:29,440
between their implementations do you
 

5193
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:31,669
between their implementations do you
wish that they were all using numpy over

5194
01:22:31,669 --> 01:22:31,679
wish that they were all using numpy over
 

5195
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:34,070
wish that they were all using numpy over
like in this abstraction yeah

5196
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:34,080
like in this abstraction yeah

01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:40,400
neuromorphic computing there might be
 

5203
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,470
neuromorphic computing there might be
other kind of or the aliens will come

5204
01:22:42,470 --> 01:22:42,480
other kind of or the aliens will come
 

5205
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,149
other kind of or the aliens will come
with a new kind of computer like an

01:22:44,149 --> 01:22:44,159
with a new kind of computer like an
 

5207
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:46,629
with a new kind of computer like an
abstraction that numpy should just

5208
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:46,639
abstraction that numpy should just
 

5209
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:49,430
abstraction that numpy should just
operate nicely over the things that are

uh it's not unifying all the arrays it's
 

5237
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:18,070
uh it's not unifying all the arrays it's
creating an api that is unified um so

01:23:18,070 --> 01:23:18,080
creating an api that is unified um so

to work through it
actually the chance to go and meet with

actually the chance to go and meet with
 

5245
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:24,870
actually the chance to go and meet with
the tensorflow team and the pi torch

the tensorflow team and the pi torch
 

5247
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,750
the tensorflow team and the pi torch
team and talk to them after uh after

01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:27,760
team and talk to them after uh after
 

5249
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,669
team and talk to them after uh after
exiting anaconda just talking about

exiting anaconda just talking about
 

5251
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:30,629

the first year after leaving a con in

the first year after leaving a con in
 

5255
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,270
the first year after leaving a con in
i became deeply aware of this and

5256
01:23:35,270 --> 01:23:35,280
i became deeply aware of this and
 

5257
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,189
i became deeply aware of this and
realized that oh this split in the array

5258
01:23:37,189 --> 01:23:37,199
realized that oh this split in the array
 

5259

makes what i was concerned about in 2005

5262
01:23:41,669 --> 01:23:41,679
makes what i was concerned about in 2005
 

5263
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:44,229
makes what i was concerned about in 2005
pretty parochial

5264
01:23:44,229 --> 01:23:44,239
pretty parochial
 

5265
01:23:44,239 --> 01:23:46,149
pretty parochial
it's a lot worse right now there's a lot

5266
01:23:46,149 --> 01:23:46,159
it's a lot worse right now there's a lot
 

5267
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:47,270
it's a lot worse right now there's a lot
more people

5268
01:23:47,270 --> 01:23:47,280
more people
 

5269
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:49,830
more people
so the perhaps the industry can sustain

5270
01:23:49,830 --> 01:23:49,840
so the perhaps the industry can sustain
 

5271
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:52,390
so the perhaps the industry can sustain
more stacks right there's a lot of money

5272
01:23:52,390 --> 01:23:52,400
more stacks right there's a lot of money
 

5273
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,070
more stacks right there's a lot of money
but it makes it a lot less efficient i

5274
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:54,080
but it makes it a lot less efficient i
 

5275
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:55,030
but it makes it a lot less efficient i
mean this

5276
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:55,040
mean this
 

5277
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,790
mean this
but i've also learned to appreciate it's

5278
01:23:56,790 --> 01:23:56,800
but i've also learned to appreciate it's
 

5279
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,629
but i've also learned to appreciate it's
okay to have some competition it's okay

5280
01:23:58,629 --> 01:23:58,639
okay to have some competition it's okay
 

5281
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:00,709
okay to have some competition it's okay
to have different implementations

5282
01:24:00,709 --> 01:24:00,719
to have different implementations
 

5283
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:02,470
to have different implementations
but it's better if you can at least

5284
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:02,480
but it's better if you can at least
 

5285
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:04,149
but it's better if you can at least
refactor some parts i mean you're going

5286
01:24:04,149 --> 01:24:04,159
refactor some parts i mean you're going
 

5287
01:24:04,159 --> 01:24:05,750
refactor some parts i mean you're going
to be more efficient if you can refactor

5288
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:05,760
to be more efficient if you can refactor
 

5289
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,510
to be more efficient if you can refactor
parts it's uh it's nice to have

5290
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:07,520
parts it's uh it's nice to have
 

5291
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,430
parts it's uh it's nice to have
competition over things

5292
01:24:09,430 --> 01:24:09,440
competition over things
 

5293
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:10,629
competition over things
overweight they're innovative

5294
01:24:10,629 --> 01:24:10,639
overweight they're innovative
 

5295
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:12,470
overweight they're innovative
competition right they're innovative

5296
01:24:12,470 --> 01:24:12,480
competition right they're innovative
 

5297
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,070
competition right they're innovative
yeah innovative and then maybe on the

5298
01:24:14,070 --> 01:24:14,080
yeah innovative and then maybe on the
 

5299
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:16,709
yeah innovative and then maybe on the
infrastructure right uh whatever however

5300
01:24:16,709 --> 01:24:16,719
infrastructure right uh whatever however
 

5301
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:19,189
infrastructure right uh whatever however
you define infrastructure right

5302
01:24:19,189 --> 01:24:19,199
you define infrastructure right
 

5303
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:21,350
you define infrastructure right
maybe it's nice to have controversial

5304
01:24:21,350 --> 01:24:21,360
maybe it's nice to have controversial
 

5305
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,510
maybe it's nice to have controversial
exactly i agree and i think but it was

5306
01:24:23,510 --> 01:24:23,520
exactly i agree and i think but it was
 

5307
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:24,709
exactly i agree and i think but it was
interesting to hear the stories i mean

5308
01:24:24,709 --> 01:24:24,719
interesting to hear the stories i mean
 

5309
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:26,310
interesting to hear the stories i mean
tensorflow came out of

5310
01:24:26,310 --> 01:24:26,320
tensorflow came out of
 

5311
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:29,510
tensorflow came out of
the c-plus plus library uh jeff dean

5312
01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:29,520
the c-plus plus library uh jeff dean
 

5313
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:31,510
the c-plus plus library uh jeff dean
wrote i think that was uh basically uh

5314
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:31,520
wrote i think that was uh basically uh
 

5315
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,510
wrote i think that was uh basically uh
how they were doing inference right and

5316
01:24:33,510 --> 01:24:33,520
how they were doing inference right and
 

5317
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:34,550
how they were doing inference right and
then they realized oh we could do this

5318
01:24:34,550 --> 01:24:34,560
then they realized oh we could do this
 

5319
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,310
then they realized oh we could do this
tensorflow thing

5320
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:36,320
tensorflow thing
 

5321
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:37,590
tensorflow thing
that close library then what was

5322
01:24:37,590 --> 01:24:37,600
that close library then what was
 

5323
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,430
that close library then what was
interesting to me was the fact that both

5324
01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:39,440
interesting to me was the fact that both
 

5325
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,910
interesting to me was the fact that both
google and facebook

5326
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:41,920
google and facebook
 

5327
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,270
google and facebook
did not it's not like they supported

5328
01:24:43,270 --> 01:24:43,280
did not it's not like they supported
 

5329
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:45,350
did not it's not like they supported
python or numpy initially they just

5330
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:45,360
python or numpy initially they just
 

5331
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,510
python or numpy initially they just
realized they had to they they came to

5332
01:24:47,510 --> 01:24:47,520
realized they had to they they came to
 

5333
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:48,709
realized they had to they they came to
this world and then all the users like

5334
01:24:48,709 --> 01:24:48,719
this world and then all the users like
 

5335
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:50,629
this world and then all the users like
hey where's the numpy interface

5336
01:24:50,629 --> 01:24:50,639
hey where's the numpy interface
 

5337
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:52,470
hey where's the numpy interface
oh and then they kind of came late to it

5338
01:24:52,470 --> 01:24:52,480
oh and then they kind of came late to it
 

5339
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,709
oh and then they kind of came late to it
and then they had these bolt-ons

5340
01:24:54,709 --> 01:24:54,719
and then they had these bolt-ons
 

5341
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:56,310
and then they had these bolt-ons
tensorflow's bolt on

5342
01:24:56,310 --> 01:24:56,320
tensorflow's bolt on
 

5343
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,310
tensorflow's bolt on
i don't mean to offend but it was so bad

5344
01:24:58,310 --> 01:24:58,320
i don't mean to offend but it was so bad
 

5345
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:01,189
i don't mean to offend but it was so bad
yeah it's the first time that i i i'm

5346
01:25:01,189 --> 01:25:01,199
yeah it's the first time that i i i'm
 

5347
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:03,189
yeah it's the first time that i i i'm
usually so i mean

5348
01:25:03,189 --> 01:25:03,199
usually so i mean
 

5349
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:04,310
usually so i mean
one of the challenges i have is i don't

5350
01:25:04,310 --> 01:25:04,320
one of the challenges i have is i don't
 

5351
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,470
one of the challenges i have is i don't
criticize enough because

5352
01:25:06,470 --> 01:25:06,480
criticize enough because
 

5353
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:07,910
criticize enough because
in the sense that i don't give people

like that
 

5373
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,910
like that
that's terrible like you're taking this

5374
01:25:25,910 --> 01:25:25,920
that's terrible like you're taking this
 

5375
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,189
that's terrible like you're taking this
beautiful system you've created and like

5376
01:25:27,189 --> 01:25:27,199
beautiful system you've created and like
 

5377
01:25:27,199 --> 01:25:28,629
beautiful system you've created and like
you're corrupting all these poor python

5378
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:28,639
you're corrupting all these poor python
 

5379
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:30,470
you're corrupting all these poor python
people forcing them to write code like

5380
01:25:30,470 --> 01:25:30,480
people forcing them to write code like
 

5381
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,149
people forcing them to write code like
that or thinking they should

5382
01:25:32,149 --> 01:25:32,159
that or thinking they should
 

5383
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:34,310
that or thinking they should
uh fortunately you know they adopted

5384
01:25:34,310 --> 01:25:34,320
uh fortunately you know they adopted
 

5385
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,310
uh fortunately you know they adopted
keras as their and that's keros is

5386
01:25:36,310 --> 01:25:36,320
keras as their and that's keros is
 

5387
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,870
keras as their and that's keros is
better and so keras tensorflow is fine

5388
01:25:38,870 --> 01:25:38,880
better and so keras tensorflow is fine
 

5389
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:42,470
better and so keras tensorflow is fine
is reasonable but um they bolted it on

5390
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:42,480
is reasonable but um they bolted it on

they had to do this one big difference

5400
01:25:51,990 --> 01:25:52,000
they had to do this one big difference
 

5401
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,430
they had to do this one big difference
is facebook maybe because the way it's

what that is because

what that is because
 

5415
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:04,709
what that is because
i guess they were worried about

5416
01:26:04,709 --> 01:26:04,719
i guess they were worried about
 

5417
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:06,709
i guess they were worried about

01:26:14,229 --> 01:26:14,239
whereas google and tensorflow they're
 

5425
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:15,430
whereas google and tensorflow they're
really eager to have user community

stand with the people right because i
 

5467
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:57,590
stand with the people right because i
feel like if you uh nurture the hackers

5468
01:26:57,590 --> 01:26:57,600
feel like if you uh nurture the hackers
 

5469
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,510
feel like if you uh nurture the hackers
you will make the right decisions in the

5470
01:26:59,510 --> 01:26:59,520
you will make the right decisions in the
 

5471
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,510
you will make the right decisions in the
long term that will make the companies

5472
01:27:01,510 --> 01:27:01,520
long term that will make the companies
 

5473
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,270
long term that will make the companies
happy i lean that way too

5474
01:27:03,270 --> 01:27:03,280
happy i lean that way too
 

5475
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:05,030
happy i lean that way too
totally but then you have to find the

5476
01:27:05,030 --> 01:27:05,040
totally but then you have to find the
 

5477
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:06,870
totally but then you have to find the
right date but it's a balance yeah it's

5478
01:27:06,870 --> 01:27:06,880
right date but it's a balance yeah it's
 

5479
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:07,990
right date but it's a balance yeah it's
because you can lean to the hackers and

5480
01:27:07,990 --> 01:27:08,000
because you can lean to the hackers and
 

5481
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,149
because you can lean to the hackers and
run out of money yeah exactly

5482
01:27:10,149 --> 01:27:10,159
run out of money yeah exactly
 

5483
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:11,350
run out of money yeah exactly
exactly

01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,709
exactly
which has been some of the challenge

5486
01:27:12,709 --> 01:27:12,719
which has been some of the challenge
 

5487
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:15,350
which has been some of the challenge
i've faced yes in the sense that like i

5488
01:27:15,350 --> 01:27:15,360
i've faced yes in the sense that like i
 

5489
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:16,470
i've faced yes in the sense that like i
like i would look at some of the

5490
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:16,480
like i would look at some of the
 

5491
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,310
like i would look at some of the
experiments like numpy the fact that we

5492
01:27:18,310 --> 01:27:18,320
experiments like numpy the fact that we
 

5493
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:20,470
experiments like numpy the fact that we
have the split is a factor of i wasn't

5494
01:27:20,470 --> 01:27:20,480
have the split is a factor of i wasn't
 

5495
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:21,830
have the split is a factor of i wasn't
able to collect more money towards

5496
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:21,840
able to collect more money towards
 

5497
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:24,470
able to collect more money towards
number development yeah right i mean i

5498
01:27:24,470 --> 01:27:24,480
number development yeah right i mean i
 

5499
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,470
number development yeah right i mean i
didn't succeed at in the early days of

5500
01:27:26,470 --> 01:27:26,480
didn't succeed at in the early days of
 

5501
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,950
didn't succeed at in the early days of
getting enough financial contribution

5502
01:27:28,950 --> 01:27:28,960
getting enough financial contribution
 

5503
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:30,950
getting enough financial contribution
and umpi so maybe i could work on it

5504
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:30,960
and umpi so maybe i could work on it
 

5505
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:32,310
and umpi so maybe i could work on it
right i couldn't work on it full-time i

5506
01:27:32,310 --> 01:27:32,320
right i couldn't work on it full-time i
 

5507
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:33,669
right i couldn't work on it full-time i
had to just

5508
01:27:33,669 --> 01:27:33,679
had to just
 

5509
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:35,669
had to just
catch an hour here an hour there

5510
01:27:35,669 --> 01:27:35,679
catch an hour here an hour there

actually part of the strategy for numpy
 

5661
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:02,790
actually part of the strategy for numpy
was to get it into python 3 and maybe be

5662
01:30:02,790 --> 01:30:02,800
was to get it into python 3 and maybe be
 

5663
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,950
was to get it into python 3 and maybe be
part of python so we talked about that

5664
01:30:04,950 --> 01:30:04,960
part of python so we talked about that
 

5665
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:06,950
part of python so we talked about that
that's cool about that approach right i

5666
01:30:06,950 --> 01:30:06,960
that's cool about that approach right i
 

5667

generally that's been true so he's
 

5685
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:27,030
generally that's been true so he's
willing to listen he's willing to defer

like on the scientific side he would
 

5689
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:29,350

was we missed a matrix multiply operator

5698
01:30:37,590 --> 01:30:37,600
was we missed a matrix multiply operator

like that finally got added to python

5700
01:30:39,510 --> 01:30:39,520
like that finally got added to python
 

5701
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:41,350
like that finally got added to python
but about 10 years later than it should

5702
01:30:41,350 --> 01:30:41,360
but about 10 years later than it should
 

5703

learned this while i was writing numpy i

5710
01:30:48,149 --> 01:30:48,159
learned this while i was writing numpy i
 

5711
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:50,070
learned this while i was writing numpy i
also wrote tools to give a python dev

5712
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:50,080
also wrote tools to give a python dev
 

5713
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:52,149
also wrote tools to give a python dev
and i added some pieces of python um

5714
01:30:52,149 --> 01:30:52,159
and i added some pieces of python um
 

5715
01:30:52,159 --> 01:30:53,910
and i added some pieces of python um
like the memory view object i wanted the

5716
01:30:53,910 --> 01:30:53,920
like the memory view object i wanted the
 

5717
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:55,750
like the memory view object i wanted the
structure of numpy into python so we

5718
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:55,760
structure of numpy into python so we
 

5719
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:57,189
structure of numpy into python so we
didn't get numpy into python but we got

5720
01:30:57,189 --> 01:30:57,199
didn't get numpy into python but we got
 

5721
01:30:57,199 --> 01:30:59,350
didn't get numpy into python but we got
the basic structure of it in the python

5722
01:30:59,350 --> 01:30:59,360
the basic structure of it in the python
 

5723
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:01,350
the basic structure of it in the python
like so you could build on it nobody did

5724
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:01,360
like so you could build on it nobody did
 

5725
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:03,030

actually fixed the memory view object

5734
01:31:10,709 --> 01:31:10,719
actually fixed the memory view object
 

5735
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:12,070
actually fixed the memory view object
because i wrote the underlying

5736
01:31:12,070 --> 01:31:12,080
because i wrote the underlying
 

5737
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:13,990

exposure was terrible until they came in
 

5741
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:17,350
exposure was terrible until they came in
and fixed it partly because i was

5742
01:31:17,350 --> 01:31:17,360
and fixed it partly because i was
 

5743
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:19,510

over the wars
uh uh you know the walrus operator the

5826
01:32:36,629 --> 01:32:36,639
uh uh you know the walrus operator the
 

5827
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:39,110
uh uh you know the walrus operator the
walrus operator was the bat last battle

5828
01:32:39,110 --> 01:32:39,120
walrus operator was the bat last battle
 

5829
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:40,790
walrus operator was the bat last battle
i don't know if that's the cause of it

5830
01:32:40,790 --> 01:32:40,800
i don't know if that's the cause of it
 

5831
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,950
i don't know if that's the cause of it
but uh this there's this for people who

5832
01:32:42,950 --> 01:32:42,960
but uh this there's this for people who
 

5833
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:44,550
but uh this there's this for people who
don't know you can look up there's the

5834
01:32:44,550 --> 01:32:44,560
don't know you can look up there's the
 

5835
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:47,110
don't know you can look up there's the
walrus operator which is uh looks like a

5836
01:32:47,110 --> 01:32:47,120
walrus operator which is uh looks like a
 

5837
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:50,310
walrus operator which is uh looks like a
colon and an equal sign yeah and equal

5838
01:32:50,310 --> 01:32:50,320
colon and an equal sign yeah and equal
 

5839
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:52,070
colon and an equal sign yeah and equal
sign and

5840
01:32:52,070 --> 01:32:52,080
sign and
 

5841
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:53,750
sign and
it actually does

5842
01:32:53,750 --> 01:32:53,760
it actually does
 

5843
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:55,510
it actually does
maybe the thing that you

5844
01:32:55,510 --> 01:32:55,520
maybe the thing that you
 

5845
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:58,470
maybe the thing that you
that an equal sign should be doing yeah

5846
01:32:58,470 --> 01:32:58,480
that an equal sign should be doing yeah
 

5847
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:00,550
that an equal sign should be doing yeah
maybe right exactly uh yeah but it's

5848
01:33:00,550 --> 01:33:00,560
maybe right exactly uh yeah but it's
 

5849
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:02,950
maybe right exactly uh yeah but it's
just historically equal sign means

5850
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:02,960
just historically equal sign means
 

5851
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:05,270
just historically equal sign means
something else it just means assignment

5852
01:33:05,270 --> 01:33:05,280
something else it just means assignment
 

5853
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:07,830
something else it just means assignment
so he stepped down over this what do you

5854
01:33:07,830 --> 01:33:07,840
so he stepped down over this what do you
 

5855
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:10,470
so he stepped down over this what do you
think about the pressure of leadership

5856
01:33:10,470 --> 01:33:10,480
think about the pressure of leadership
 

5857
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:11,669

so i sort of you know create you create
 

5939
01:34:18,239 --> 01:34:20,070
so i sort of you know create you create
kind of doubters on both sides so when

5940
01:34:20,070 --> 01:34:20,080
kind of doubters on both sides so when
 

5941
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:22,709
kind of doubters on both sides so when
you have and this is just a

5942
01:34:22,709 --> 01:34:22,719
you have and this is just a
 

5943
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:25,910
you have and this is just a
a plea to the listener and the public

5944
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:25,920
a plea to the listener and the public
 

5945
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,590
a plea to the listener and the public
i've noticed this too

5946
01:34:27,590 --> 01:34:27,600
i've noticed this too
 

5947
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:28,550
i've noticed this too
that

5948
01:34:28,550 --> 01:34:28,560
that
 

5949
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:30,709
that
there's a tendency and social media

5950
01:34:30,709 --> 01:34:30,719
there's a tendency and social media
 

5951
01:34:30,719 --> 01:34:32,629
there's a tendency and social media
makes this worse

5952
01:34:32,629 --> 01:34:32,639
makes this worse
 

5953
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:34,550
makes this worse
when you don't have perfect information

5954
01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:34,560
when you don't have perfect information
 

5955
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,390
when you don't have perfect information
about the situation you tend to fill the

5956
01:34:36,390 --> 01:34:36,400
about the situation you tend to fill the
 

5957
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:37,669
about the situation you tend to fill the
gaps with the

5958
01:34:37,669 --> 01:34:37,679
gaps with the
 

5959
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:40,790
gaps with the
the worst possible or at least a bad

5960
01:34:40,790 --> 01:34:40,800
the worst possible or at least a bad
 

5961
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:44,229
the worst possible or at least a bad
uh story that fills those gaps and

5962
01:34:44,229 --> 01:34:44,239
uh story that fills those gaps and
 

5963

01:34:49,109 --> 01:34:49,119
uh maybe not fully naively but filling
 

5967
01:34:49,119 --> 01:34:51,189
uh maybe not fully naively but filling
in the gaps with the with the with the

so if you see somebody like you trying
 

5979
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:01,830
so if you see somebody like you trying
to make money on a book about numpy

5980
01:35:01,830 --> 01:35:01,840
to make money on a book about numpy
 

5981
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:03,910
to make money on a book about numpy
there's a million stories around that

5982
01:35:03,910 --> 01:35:03,920
there's a million stories around that
 

5983
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:06,470
there's a million stories around that
that are positive and those are good to

5984
01:35:06,470 --> 01:35:06,480
that are positive and those are good to
 

5985
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:07,750
that are positive and those are good to
think about

5986
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:07,760
think about
 

5987
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:10,550
think about
to project positive intent on to people

5988
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:10,560
to project positive intent on to people
 

5989
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:11,590
to project positive intent on to people
because

5990
01:35:11,590 --> 01:35:11,600
because
 

5991
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,430
because
for many reasons usually because people

5992
01:35:13,430 --> 01:35:13,440
for many reasons usually because people
 

5993
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,430
for many reasons usually because people
are good and they do have good intent

5994
01:35:15,430 --> 01:35:15,440
are good and they do have good intent
 

5995
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:17,030
are good and they do have good intent
and also when you project that positive

5996
01:35:17,030 --> 01:35:17,040
and also when you project that positive
 

5997
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:19,030
and also when you project that positive
intent people step up to that

5998
01:35:19,030 --> 01:35:19,040
intent people step up to that
 

5999
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:21,350
intent people step up to that
too yes so like it's it has a great

6000
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:21,360
too yes so like it's it has a great
 

6001
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:23,669
too yes so like it's it has a great
point it has this kind of viral nature

6002
01:35:23,669 --> 01:35:23,679
point it has this kind of viral nature
 

6003
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:25,270
point it has this kind of viral nature
to it and of course

6004
01:35:25,270 --> 01:35:25,280
to it and of course
 

6005
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:27,669
to it and of course
what twitter early on figured out on

6006
01:35:27,669 --> 01:35:27,679
what twitter early on figured out on
 

6007
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:29,830
what twitter early on figured out on
facebook is that they can make a lot of

6008
01:35:29,830 --> 01:35:29,840
facebook is that they can make a lot of
 

6009
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:32,229
facebook is that they can make a lot of
money and engagement from the negative

6010
01:35:32,229 --> 01:35:32,239
money and engagement from the negative
 

6011
01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:34,470
money and engagement from the negative
yes so like there's this we're fighting

6012
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:34,480
yes so like there's this we're fighting
 

6013
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:35,990
yes so like there's this we're fighting
this mechanism i agree it's just

6014
01:35:35,990 --> 01:35:36,000
this mechanism i agree it's just
 

6015
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,830
this mechanism i agree it's just
challenging it's like easier it's just

6016
01:35:37,830 --> 01:35:37,840
challenging it's like easier it's just
 

6017
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,910
challenging it's like easier it's just
easier to be to be negative and then for

6018
01:35:39,910 --> 01:35:39,920
easier to be to be negative and then for
 

6019
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:41,830
easier to be to be negative and then for
some reason something in our minds

6020
01:35:41,830 --> 01:35:41,840
some reason something in our minds
 

6021
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:43,910
some reason something in our minds
really enjoys sharing that and getting

6022
01:35:43,910 --> 01:35:43,920
really enjoys sharing that and getting
 

6023
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:46,149
really enjoys sharing that and getting
getting all excited about the negativity

6024
01:35:46,149 --> 01:35:46,159
getting all excited about the negativity
 

6025
01:35:46,159 --> 01:35:47,990
getting all excited about the negativity
we do yeah but but the protective

6026
01:35:47,990 --> 01:35:48,000
we do yeah but but the protective
 

6027
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,990
we do yeah but but the protective
mechanism perhaps that we're we're going

6028
01:35:49,990 --> 01:35:50,000
mechanism perhaps that we're we're going
 

6029
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,669
mechanism perhaps that we're we're going
to eat and if we don't exactly for us to

6030
01:35:51,669 --> 01:35:51,679
to eat and if we don't exactly for us to
 

6031
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:53,189
to eat and if we don't exactly for us to
be effective as a group of people in a

6032
01:35:53,189 --> 01:35:53,199
be effective as a group of people in a
 

6033
01:35:53,199 --> 01:35:54,950
be effective as a group of people in a
software engineering project you have to

6034
01:35:54,950 --> 01:35:54,960
software engineering project you have to
 

6035
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:56,790
software engineering project you have to
project positive intent i think i

6036
01:35:56,790 --> 01:35:56,800
project positive intent i think i
 

6037
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:58,390
project positive intent i think i
totally agree totally agree and i think

6038
01:35:58,390 --> 01:35:58,400
totally agree totally agree and i think
 

6039
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,950
totally agree totally agree and i think
that's very so that that happens in this

6040
01:36:00,950 --> 01:36:00,960
that's very so that that happens in this
 

6041
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:02,709
that's very so that that happens in this
in the space but python has done a

6042
01:36:02,709 --> 01:36:02,719
in the space but python has done a
 

6043
01:36:02,719 --> 01:36:04,229
in the space but python has done a
reasonable job in the past but here's a

6044
01:36:04,229 --> 01:36:04,239
reasonable job in the past but here's a
 

6045
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:05,510
reasonable job in the past but here's a
situation where i think it's it's

6046
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:05,520
situation where i think it's it's
 

6047
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:06,870
situation where i think it's it's
starting to get this pressure where it

6048
01:36:06,870 --> 01:36:06,880
starting to get this pressure where it
 

6049
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:09,109
starting to get this pressure where it
didn't i was i really didn't i didn't

6050
01:36:09,109 --> 01:36:09,119
didn't i was i really didn't i didn't
 

6051
01:36:09,119 --> 01:36:10,550
didn't i was i really didn't i didn't
know enough about what happened i've you

6052
01:36:10,550 --> 01:36:10,560
know enough about what happened i've you
 

6053
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:11,990
know enough about what happened i've you
know talked to several people about it

6054
01:36:11,990 --> 01:36:12,000
know talked to several people about it
 

6055
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:12,950
know talked to several people about it
and i know

6056
01:36:12,950 --> 01:36:12,960
and i know
 

6057
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:14,229
and i know
i think most of the steering committee

6058
01:36:14,229 --> 01:36:14,239
i think most of the steering committee
 

6059
01:36:14,239 --> 01:36:15,430
i think most of the steering committee
members today

6060
01:36:15,430 --> 01:36:15,440
members today
 

6061
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:17,510
members today
uh one one person nominated me for that

6062
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:17,520
uh one one person nominated me for that
 

6063
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,109
uh one one person nominated me for that
role but it's the wrong role for me

6064
01:36:19,109 --> 01:36:19,119
role but it's the wrong role for me
 

6065
01:36:19,119 --> 01:36:20,390
role but it's the wrong role for me
right now right

6066
01:36:20,390 --> 01:36:20,400
right now right
 

6067
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,390
right now right
um i have a lot of respect for the

6068
01:36:22,390 --> 01:36:22,400
um i have a lot of respect for the
 

6069
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:24,310
um i have a lot of respect for the
python developer space and the python

6070
01:36:24,310 --> 01:36:24,320
python developer space and the python
 

6071
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,390
python developer space and the python
developers i also understand the gap

6072
01:36:26,390 --> 01:36:26,400
developers i also understand the gap
 

6073
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:27,830
developers i also understand the gap
between computer science python

6074
01:36:27,830 --> 01:36:27,840
between computer science python
 

6075
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:29,910
between computer science python
developers and array programming

6076
01:36:29,910 --> 01:36:29,920
developers and array programming
 

6077
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:32,070
developers and array programming
developers or science developers in fact

6078
01:36:32,070 --> 01:36:32,080
developers or science developers in fact
 

6079
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:34,550
developers or science developers in fact
python succeeds in the array space the

6080
01:36:34,550 --> 01:36:34,560
python succeeds in the array space the
 

6081
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,550
python succeeds in the array space the
more it has people in that boundary and

6082
01:36:36,550 --> 01:36:36,560
more it has people in that boundary and
 

6083
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:38,229
more it has people in that boundary and
there's often very few like i was

6084
01:36:38,229 --> 01:36:38,239
there's often very few like i was
 

6085
01:36:38,239 --> 01:36:39,669
there's often very few like i was
playing a role in that boundary and you

6086
01:36:39,669 --> 01:36:39,679
playing a role in that boundary and you
 

6087
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:42,070
playing a role in that boundary and you
know working like everything to try to

6088
01:36:42,070 --> 01:36:42,080
know working like everything to try to
 

6089
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:43,430
know working like everything to try to
keep up with the

6090
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:43,440
keep up with the
 

6091
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,350
keep up with the
with the what even what guido was saying

6092
01:36:45,350 --> 01:36:45,360
with the what even what guido was saying
 

6093
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:46,390
with the what even what guido was saying
like

6094
01:36:46,390 --> 01:36:46,400
like
 

6095
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,310
like
i'm a c programmer but not a computer

6096
01:36:48,310 --> 01:36:48,320
i'm a c programmer but not a computer
 

6097
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,709
i'm a c programmer but not a computer
scientist like i was a engineer and

6098
01:36:50,709 --> 01:36:50,719
scientist like i was a engineer and
 

6099
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:52,470
scientist like i was a engineer and
physicist and mathematician

6100
01:36:52,470 --> 01:36:52,480
physicist and mathematician
 

6101
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,790
physicist and mathematician
and i don't i didn't always understand

6102
01:36:54,790 --> 01:36:54,800
and i don't i didn't always understand
 

6103
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:56,550
and i don't i didn't always understand
what they were talking about and why

6104
01:36:56,550 --> 01:36:56,560
what they were talking about and why
 

6105
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:57,669
what they were talking about and why
they would have opinions the way they

6106
01:36:57,669 --> 01:36:57,679
they would have opinions the way they
 

6107
01:36:57,679 --> 01:36:59,750
they would have opinions the way they
did so you have to listen and try to

6108
01:36:59,750 --> 01:36:59,760
did so you have to listen and try to
 

6109
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:01,350
did so you have to listen and try to
understand then you also have to explain

6110
01:37:01,350 --> 01:37:01,360
understand then you also have to explain
 

6111
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:02,550
understand then you also have to explain
your point of view in a way they can

6112
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:02,560
your point of view in a way they can
 

6113
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:04,709
your point of view in a way they can
understand and that takes a lot of work

6114
01:37:04,709 --> 01:37:04,719
understand and that takes a lot of work
 

6115
01:37:04,719 --> 01:37:06,629
understand and that takes a lot of work
and that that communication

6116
01:37:06,629 --> 01:37:06,639
and that that communication
 

6117
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:08,149
and that that communication
is always the challenge and it's just

6118
01:37:08,149 --> 01:37:08,159
is always the challenge and it's just
 

6119
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:09,350
is always the challenge and it's just
what we're describing here about the

6120
01:37:09,350 --> 01:37:09,360
what we're describing here about the
 

6121
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,270
what we're describing here about the
negativity is just another form of that

6122
01:37:11,270 --> 01:37:11,280
negativity is just another form of that
 

6123
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:13,030
negativity is just another form of that
like how do we come together and it does

6124
01:37:13,030 --> 01:37:13,040
like how do we come together and it does
 

6125
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:14,790
like how do we come together and it does
appear we're wired anyway to at least

6126
01:37:14,790 --> 01:37:14,800
appear we're wired anyway to at least
 

6127
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:15,669
appear we're wired anyway to at least
have a

6128
01:37:15,669 --> 01:37:15,679
have a
 

6129
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:17,830
have a
there's a part of us that will enemy you

6130
01:37:17,830 --> 01:37:17,840
there's a part of us that will enemy you
 

6131
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,430
there's a part of us that will enemy you
know friend enemy and

6132
01:37:19,430 --> 01:37:19,440
know friend enemy and
 

6133
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:21,590
know friend enemy and
and we see yeah it's like why are we

6134
01:37:21,590 --> 01:37:21,600
and we see yeah it's like why are we
 

6135
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:23,990
and we see yeah it's like why are we
wiring on the enemy front yeah so so why

6136
01:37:23,990 --> 01:37:24,000
wiring on the enemy front yeah so so why
 

6137
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,270
wiring on the enemy front yeah so so why
are we pushing that why are we promoting

6138
01:37:25,270 --> 01:37:25,280
are we pushing that why are we promoting
 

6139
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:27,669
are we pushing that why are we promoting
that so deeply let's assume friend until

6140
01:37:27,669 --> 01:37:27,679
that so deeply let's assume friend until
 

6141
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:29,830
that so deeply let's assume friend until
proven otherwise yes yeah

6142
01:37:29,830 --> 01:37:29,840
proven otherwise yes yeah
 

6143
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:31,350
proven otherwise yes yeah
so because you have such a fascinating

6144
01:37:31,350 --> 01:37:31,360
so because you have such a fascinating
 

6145
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:32,870
so because you have such a fascinating
mind and all this let me just ask you

6146
01:37:32,870 --> 01:37:32,880
mind and all this let me just ask you
 

6147
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:35,030
mind and all this let me just ask you
these questions so one interesting side

6148
01:37:35,030 --> 01:37:35,040
these questions so one interesting side
 

6149
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:37,030
these questions so one interesting side
on the python

6150
01:37:37,030 --> 01:37:37,040
on the python
 

6151
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:40,149
on the python
history is the move from python 2 to

6152
01:37:40,149 --> 01:37:40,159
history is the move from python 2 to
 

6153
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:42,709
history is the move from python 2 to
python 3. you mentioned move from python

6154
01:37:42,709 --> 01:37:42,719
python 3. you mentioned move from python
 

6155
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:44,550
python 3. you mentioned move from python
1 to python 2 but

6156
01:37:44,550 --> 01:37:44,560
1 to python 2 but
 

6157
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:46,950
1 to python 2 but
the move from python 2 to python 3 is a

6158
01:37:46,950 --> 01:37:46,960
the move from python 2 to python 3 is a
 

6159
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:48,470
the move from python 2 to python 3 is a
little bit interesting because it took a

6160
01:37:48,470 --> 01:37:48,480
little bit interesting because it took a
 

6161
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:51,750
little bit interesting because it took a
very long time it uh it broke

6162
01:37:51,750 --> 01:37:51,760
very long time it uh it broke
 

6163
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:53,830
very long time it uh it broke
in a quite a small way backward

6164
01:37:53,830 --> 01:37:53,840
in a quite a small way backward
 

6165
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:56,229
in a quite a small way backward
compatibility but even that small way

6166
01:37:56,229 --> 01:37:56,239
compatibility but even that small way
 

6167
01:37:56,239 --> 01:37:57,830
compatibility but even that small way
seemed to have been very painful for

6168
01:37:57,830 --> 01:37:57,840
seemed to have been very painful for
 

6169
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:00,390
seemed to have been very painful for
people is there lessons

6170
01:38:00,390 --> 01:38:00,400
people is there lessons
 

6171
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:03,590
people is there lessons
tons of lessons from uh from how long it

6172
01:38:03,590 --> 01:38:03,600
tons of lessons from uh from how long it
 

6173
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,430
tons of lessons from uh from how long it
took and how painful it seemed to be

6174
01:38:05,430 --> 01:38:05,440
took and how painful it seemed to be
 

6175
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:07,590
took and how painful it seemed to be
yeah tons of lessons well i mentioned

6176
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:07,600
yeah tons of lessons well i mentioned
 

6177
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:09,430
yeah tons of lessons well i mentioned
here earlier that

6178
01:38:09,430 --> 01:38:09,440
here earlier that
 

6179
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:11,669
here earlier that
numpy was written in 2005.

6180
01:38:11,669 --> 01:38:11,679
numpy was written in 2005.
 

6181
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:15,030
numpy was written in 2005.
it was in 2005 that i actually went to

6182
01:38:15,030 --> 01:38:15,040
it was in 2005 that i actually went to
 

6183
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:16,629
it was in 2005 that i actually went to
guido to talk about getting numpy into

6184
01:38:16,629 --> 01:38:16,639
guido to talk about getting numpy into
 

6185
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:18,709
guido to talk about getting numpy into
python 3. like my strategy was to

6186
01:38:18,709 --> 01:38:18,719
python 3. like my strategy was to
 

6187
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:20,229
python 3. like my strategy was to
oh we're moving to python 3. let's have

6188
01:38:20,229 --> 01:38:20,239
oh we're moving to python 3. let's have
 

6189
01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:22,070
oh we're moving to python 3. let's have
that be and it seems funny in retrospect

6190
01:38:22,070 --> 01:38:22,080
that be and it seems funny in retrospect
 

6191
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,669
that be and it seems funny in retrospect
because like wait python 3 that was in

6192
01:38:23,669 --> 01:38:23,679
because like wait python 3 that was in
 

6193
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:26,470
because like wait python 3 that was in
20 2020 right when we finally

6194
01:38:26,470 --> 01:38:26,480
20 2020 right when we finally
 

6195
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:27,910
20 2020 right when we finally
ended support for python 2 or at least

6196
01:38:27,910 --> 01:38:27,920
ended support for python 2 or at least
 

6197
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:30,870
ended support for python 2 or at least
2017. the reason it took a long time a

6198
01:38:30,870 --> 01:38:30,880
2017. the reason it took a long time a
 

6199
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:32,629
2017. the reason it took a long time a
lot of time i think it was because

6200
01:38:32,629 --> 01:38:32,639
lot of time i think it was because
 

6201
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:33,830
lot of time i think it was because
one of the things is there wasn't much

6202
01:38:33,830 --> 01:38:33,840
one of the things is there wasn't much
 

6203
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:38,070
one of the things is there wasn't much
to like about python 3. 3.0 3.1 it

6204
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:38,080
to like about python 3. 3.0 3.1 it
 

6205
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:40,870
to like about python 3. 3.0 3.1 it
really wasn't until 3.3 like i consider

6206
01:38:40,870 --> 01:38:40,880
really wasn't until 3.3 like i consider
 

6207
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:43,350
really wasn't until 3.3 like i consider
python 3.3 to be python 3.0

6208
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:43,360
python 3.3 to be python 3.0
 

6209
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:44,870
python 3.3 to be python 3.0
but it wasn't until python 3.3 that i

6210
01:38:44,870 --> 01:38:44,880
but it wasn't until python 3.3 that i
 

6211
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:47,030
but it wasn't until python 3.3 that i
thought there's enough stuff in it

6212
01:38:47,030 --> 01:38:47,040
thought there's enough stuff in it
 

6213
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:49,350
thought there's enough stuff in it
to make it worth anybody using it

6214
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:49,360
to make it worth anybody using it
 

6215
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:51,030
to make it worth anybody using it
right and then three four started to be

6216
01:38:51,030 --> 01:38:51,040
right and then three four started to be
 

6217
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:53,350
right and then three four started to be
oh yeah i want that and then three five

6218
01:38:53,350 --> 01:38:53,360
oh yeah i want that and then three five
 

6219
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:54,870
oh yeah i want that and then three five
as the matrix multiply operator and now

6220
01:38:54,870 --> 01:38:54,880
as the matrix multiply operator and now
 

6221
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:56,629
as the matrix multiply operator and now
it's like okay we gotta use that plus

6222
01:38:56,629 --> 01:38:56,639
it's like okay we gotta use that plus
 

6223
01:38:56,639 --> 01:38:57,990
it's like okay we gotta use that plus
the libraries that started leveraging

6224
01:38:57,990 --> 01:38:58,000
the libraries that started leveraging
 

6225
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,669
the libraries that started leveraging
the some of the features of python

6226
01:38:59,669 --> 01:38:59,679
the some of the features of python
 

6227
01:38:59,679 --> 01:39:02,070
the some of the features of python
exactly yeah so it really the challenge

6228
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:02,080
exactly yeah so it really the challenge
 

6229
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:03,590
exactly yeah so it really the challenge
was it was

6230
01:39:03,590 --> 01:39:03,600
was it was
 

6231
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:06,470
was it was
but it also illustrated a truism that

6232
01:39:06,470 --> 01:39:06,480
but it also illustrated a truism that
 

6233
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:08,149
but it also illustrated a truism that
you know it's when you have inertia when

6234
01:39:08,149 --> 01:39:08,159
you know it's when you have inertia when
 

6235
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:09,030
you know it's when you have inertia when
you have a pop when you have a group of

6236
01:39:09,030 --> 01:39:09,040
you have a pop when you have a group of
 

6237
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:10,870
you have a pop when you have a group of
people using something it's really hard

6238
01:39:10,870 --> 01:39:10,880
people using something it's really hard
 

6239
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:12,310
people using something it's really hard
to move them away from it you can't just

6240
01:39:12,310 --> 01:39:12,320
to move them away from it you can't just
 

6241
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:14,550
to move them away from it you can't just
change the world on them and python 3

6242
01:39:14,550 --> 01:39:14,560
change the world on them and python 3
 

6243
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:15,990
change the world on them and python 3
you know made some i think it fixed some

6244
01:39:15,990 --> 01:39:16,000
you know made some i think it fixed some
 

6245
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,350
you know made some i think it fixed some
things guido had always hated i don't

6246
01:39:17,350 --> 01:39:17,360
things guido had always hated i don't
 

6247
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:18,629
things guido had always hated i don't
think he didn't like the fact print was

6248
01:39:18,629 --> 01:39:18,639
think he didn't like the fact print was
 

6249
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:19,830
think he didn't like the fact print was
a statement he wanted to make it a

6250
01:39:19,830 --> 01:39:19,840
a statement he wanted to make it a
 

6251
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:21,510
a statement he wanted to make it a
function but in some sense there's a bit

6252
01:39:21,510 --> 01:39:21,520
function but in some sense there's a bit
 

6253
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:24,870
function but in some sense there's a bit
of gratuitous change to the language and

6254
01:39:24,870 --> 01:39:24,880
of gratuitous change to the language and
 

6255
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:27,189
of gratuitous change to the language and
you could argue and there's people have

6256
01:39:27,189 --> 01:39:27,199
you could argue and there's people have
 

6257
01:39:27,199 --> 01:39:27,910
you could argue and there's people have
but

6258
01:39:27,910 --> 01:39:27,920
but
 

6259
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:28,950
but
there was

6260
01:39:28,950 --> 01:39:28,960
there was
 

6261
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:30,390
there was
one of the challenges was there wasn't

6262
01:39:30,390 --> 01:39:30,400
one of the challenges was there wasn't
 

6263
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:32,550
one of the challenges was there wasn't
enough features and too many just

6264
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:32,560
enough features and too many just
 

6265
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:33,750
enough features and too many just
changes

6266
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:33,760
changes
 

6267
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,750
changes
without features and

6268
01:39:35,750 --> 01:39:35,760
without features and
 

6269
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:37,510
without features and
so that empathy for the end user as to

6270
01:39:37,510 --> 01:39:37,520
so that empathy for the end user as to
 

6271
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:39,830
so that empathy for the end user as to
why they would switch wasn't wasn't

6272
01:39:39,830 --> 01:39:39,840
why they would switch wasn't wasn't
 

6273
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,750
why they would switch wasn't wasn't
there i think also it illustrated just

6274
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:41,760
there i think also it illustrated just
 

6275
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:43,990
there i think also it illustrated just
the funding realities like python wasn't

6276
01:39:43,990 --> 01:39:44,000
the funding realities like python wasn't
 

6277
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,149
the funding realities like python wasn't
funded like it was also a project with a

6278
01:39:46,149 --> 01:39:46,159
funded like it was also a project with a
 

6279
01:39:46,159 --> 01:39:47,910
funded like it was also a project with a
bunch of volunteer labor

6280
01:39:47,910 --> 01:39:47,920
bunch of volunteer labor
 

6281
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:49,430
bunch of volunteer labor
right it had more people so more

6282
01:39:49,430 --> 01:39:49,440
right it had more people so more
 

6283
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:51,510
right it had more people so more
volunteer labor but it was still it was

6284
01:39:51,510 --> 01:39:51,520
volunteer labor but it was still it was
 

6285
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:53,030
volunteer labor but it was still it was
fun in the sense that least guido had a

6286
01:39:53,030 --> 01:39:53,040
fun in the sense that least guido had a
 

6287
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:54,550
fun in the sense that least guido had a
job and i i've learned some of the

6288
01:39:54,550 --> 01:39:54,560
job and i i've learned some of the
 

6289
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:56,070
job and i i've learned some of the
behind the scenes on that now since

6290
01:39:56,070 --> 01:39:56,080
behind the scenes on that now since
 

6291
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:57,430
behind the scenes on that now since
since talking to people who lived

6292
01:39:57,430 --> 01:39:57,440
since talking to people who lived
 

6293
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:58,550
since talking to people who lived
through it and

6294
01:39:58,550 --> 01:39:58,560
through it and
 

6295
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,070
through it and
uh maybe not on air we can talk about

6296
01:40:00,070 --> 01:40:00,080
uh maybe not on air we can talk about
 

6297
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:01,350
uh maybe not on air we can talk about
something

6298
01:40:01,350 --> 01:40:01,360
something
 

6299
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:02,870
something
but it's interesting to see but guido

6300
01:40:02,870 --> 01:40:02,880
but it's interesting to see but guido
 

6301
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:05,189
but it's interesting to see but guido
had a job but he but his full-time job

6302
01:40:05,189 --> 01:40:05,199
had a job but he but his full-time job
 

6303
01:40:05,199 --> 01:40:07,109
had a job but he but his full-time job
wasn't just work on python yeah like he

6304
01:40:07,109 --> 01:40:07,119
wasn't just work on python yeah like he
 

6305
01:40:07,119 --> 01:40:08,709
wasn't just work on python yeah like he
had other things to do

6306
01:40:08,709 --> 01:40:08,719
had other things to do
 

6307
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:10,950
had other things to do
it's just wild it is wild isn't it as

6308
01:40:10,950 --> 01:40:10,960
it's just wild it is wild isn't it as
 

6309
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:13,990
it's just wild it is wild isn't it as
well how few people are funded yes how

6310
01:40:13,990 --> 01:40:14,000
well how few people are funded yes how
 

6311
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,070
well how few people are funded yes how
much impact they have yes

6312
01:40:16,070 --> 01:40:16,080
much impact they have yes
 

6313
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:17,590
much impact they have yes
maybe that's a feature not a bug i don't

6314
01:40:17,590 --> 01:40:17,600
maybe that's a feature not a bug i don't
 

6315
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:19,750
maybe that's a feature not a bug i don't
know maybe yes exactly at least early on

6316
01:40:19,750 --> 01:40:19,760
know maybe yes exactly at least early on
 

6317
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:22,310
know maybe yes exactly at least early on
like it's sort of i know yeah it's like

6318
01:40:22,310 --> 01:40:22,320
like it's sort of i know yeah it's like
 

6319
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:24,390
like it's sort of i know yeah it's like
olympic athletes are often severely

6320
01:40:24,390 --> 01:40:24,400
olympic athletes are often severely
 

6321
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:26,229
olympic athletes are often severely
underfunded but maybe that's what brings

6322
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:26,239
underfunded but maybe that's what brings
 

6323
01:40:26,239 --> 01:40:28,550
underfunded but maybe that's what brings
out the greatness perhaps yes correct no

6324
01:40:28,550 --> 01:40:28,560
out the greatness perhaps yes correct no
 

6325
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:29,590
out the greatness perhaps yes correct no
exactly

6326
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:29,600
exactly
 

6327
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:30,709
exactly
maybe this is

6328
01:40:30,709 --> 01:40:30,719
maybe this is
 

6329
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:32,310
maybe this is
essential part of it because i do think

6330
01:40:32,310 --> 01:40:32,320
essential part of it because i do think
 

6331
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:34,149
essential part of it because i do think
about that in terms of i currently have

6332
01:40:34,149 --> 01:40:34,159
about that in terms of i currently have
 

6333
01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:35,990
about that in terms of i currently have
an incubator for open source startups

6334
01:40:35,990 --> 01:40:36,000
an incubator for open source startups
 

6335
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,750

like what i'm trying to do right now is

6336
01:40:37,750 --> 01:40:37,760
like what i'm trying to do right now is
 

6337
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:39,830
like what i'm trying to do right now is
create the environment i wish that

6338
01:40:39,830 --> 01:40:39,840
create the environment i wish that
 

6339
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:42,310
create the environment i wish that
existed when i was leaving academia with

6340
01:40:42,310 --> 01:40:42,320
existed when i was leaving academia with
 

6341
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:43,350
existed when i was leaving academia with
numpy and trying to figure out what to

6342
01:40:43,350 --> 01:40:43,360
numpy and trying to figure out what to
 

6343
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:44,870
numpy and trying to figure out what to
do i'm trying to create those

6344
01:40:44,870 --> 01:40:44,880
do i'm trying to create those
 

6345
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:46,790
do i'm trying to create those
opportunities and environments so

6346
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:46,800
opportunities and environments so
 

6347
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:48,870
opportunities and environments so
uh and that's that's what drives me

6348
01:40:48,870 --> 01:40:48,880
uh and that's that's what drives me
 

6349
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:50,550
uh and that's that's what drives me
still is how do i make the world easier

6350
01:40:50,550 --> 01:40:50,560
still is how do i make the world easier
 

6351
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:52,870
still is how do i make the world easier

01:42:09,270 --> 01:42:09,280
the trade-off between usability and

6427
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:12,870
efficiency
broadly in numpy but also on these like

6428
01:42:12,870 --> 01:42:12,880
broadly in numpy but also on these like
 

6429
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:15,750
broadly in numpy but also on these like
specific weird quirks of like a single

6430
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:15,760
specific weird quirks of like a single
 

6431
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:17,590
specific weird quirks of like a single
function yep so

6432
01:42:17,590 --> 01:42:17,600
function yep so
 

6433
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,030
function yep so
on that point

6434
01:42:19,030 --> 01:42:19,040
on that point
 

6435
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:22,550
on that point
if you use a numpy math function on a

6436
01:42:22,550 --> 01:42:22,560
if you use a numpy math function on a
 

6437
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:23,590
if you use a numpy math function on a
scalar

6438
01:42:23,590 --> 01:42:23,600
scalar
 

6439
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:25,510
scalar
it's going to be slower than using a

6440
01:42:25,510 --> 01:42:25,520
it's going to be slower than using a
 

6441
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:28,709
it's going to be slower than using a
python function on that scalar yeah but

6442
01:42:28,709 --> 01:42:28,719
python function on that scalar yeah but
 

6443
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:31,669
python function on that scalar yeah but
because the the math object in p in

6444
01:42:31,669 --> 01:42:31,679
because the the math object in p in
 

6445
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:33,750
because the the math object in p in
numpy is more complicated right because

6446
01:42:33,750 --> 01:42:33,760
numpy is more complicated right because
 

6447
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:35,669
numpy is more complicated right because
you can also call that math object on an

6448
01:42:35,669 --> 01:42:35,679
you can also call that math object on an
 

6449
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:36,550
you can also call that math object on an
array

6450
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:36,560
array
 

6451
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:38,470
array
and so effectively it goes through a

6452
01:42:38,470 --> 01:42:38,480
and so effectively it goes through a
 

6453
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:40,470
and so effectively it goes through a
similar machine there aren't enough of

6454
01:42:40,470 --> 01:42:40,480
similar machine there aren't enough of
 

6455
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:42,550
similar machine there aren't enough of
the which you would do in a and you

6456
01:42:42,550 --> 01:42:42,560
the which you would do in a and you
 

6457
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:44,629
the which you would do in a and you
could do like checks and

6458
01:42:44,629 --> 01:42:44,639
could do like checks and
 

6459
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:45,910
could do like checks and
fast paths

6460
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:45,920
fast paths
 

6461
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:48,709
fast paths
so yeah if you're basically doing a list

6462
01:42:48,709 --> 01:42:48,719
so yeah if you're basically doing a list
 

6463
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:50,709
so yeah if you're basically doing a list
if you run over a list in fact for

6464
01:42:50,709 --> 01:42:50,719
if you run over a list in fact for
 

6465
01:42:50,719 --> 01:42:52,229
if you run over a list in fact for
problems that are less than

6466
01:42:52,229 --> 01:42:52,239
problems that are less than
 

6467
01:42:52,239 --> 01:42:53,590
problems that are less than
a thousand

6468
01:42:53,590 --> 01:42:53,600
a thousand
 

6469
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:55,430
a thousand
even maybe 10 000 it's probably the if

6470
01:42:55,430 --> 01:42:55,440
even maybe 10 000 it's probably the if
 

6471
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:56,950
even maybe 10 000 it's probably the if
you're going more than 10 000 that's

6472
01:42:56,950 --> 01:42:56,960
you're going more than 10 000 that's
 

6473
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:58,070
you're going more than 10 000 that's
where you definitely need to be using

6474
01:42:58,070 --> 01:42:58,080
where you definitely need to be using
 

6475
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:00,229
where you definitely need to be using
arrays but if you're less than that and

6476
01:43:00,229 --> 01:43:00,239
arrays but if you're less than that and
 

6477
01:43:00,239 --> 01:43:02,149
arrays but if you're less than that and
for reading if you're doing a reading

6478
01:43:02,149 --> 01:43:02,159
for reading if you're doing a reading
 

6479
01:43:02,159 --> 01:43:04,070
for reading if you're doing a reading
process and essentially it's not compute

6480
01:43:04,070 --> 01:43:04,080
process and essentially it's not compute
 

6481
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:06,070
process and essentially it's not compute
bound it's i o bound and so you're

6482
01:43:06,070 --> 01:43:06,080
bound it's i o bound and so you're
 

6483
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:07,830
bound it's i o bound and so you're
you're really taking lists of thousand

6484
01:43:07,830 --> 01:43:07,840
you're really taking lists of thousand
 

6485
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:09,750
you're really taking lists of thousand
at a time and doing work on it yeah you

6486
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:09,760
at a time and doing work on it yeah you
 

6487
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:11,430
at a time and doing work on it yeah you
could be faster just using python

6488
01:43:11,430 --> 01:43:11,440
could be faster just using python
 

6489
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:14,550
could be faster just using python
straight up python see but also

6490
01:43:14,550 --> 01:43:14,560
straight up python see but also
 

6491
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:15,910
straight up python see but also
and then this is the so sorry to

6492
01:43:15,910 --> 01:43:15,920
and then this is the so sorry to
 

6493
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:17,510
and then this is the so sorry to
introduce there's the fundamental

6494
01:43:17,510 --> 01:43:17,520
introduce there's the fundamental
 

6495
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:18,550
introduce there's the fundamental
questions

6496
01:43:18,550 --> 01:43:18,560
questions
 

6497
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:21,109
questions
when you look at the long arc of history

6498
01:43:21,109 --> 01:43:21,119
when you look at the long arc of history
 

6499
01:43:21,119 --> 01:43:23,430
when you look at the long arc of history
it's very possible that np

6500
01:43:23,430 --> 01:43:23,440
it's very possible that np
 

6501
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:26,470
it's very possible that np
square is much faster it could be so

6502
01:43:26,470 --> 01:43:26,480
square is much faster it could be so
 

6503
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:29,189
square is much faster it could be so
like in terms of like don't worry about

6504
01:43:29,189 --> 01:43:29,199
like in terms of like don't worry about
 

6505
01:43:29,199 --> 01:43:30,870
like in terms of like don't worry about
it it's the the evils of over

01:43:35,990 --> 01:43:36,000
different quotes are on that it's is uh
 

6511
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,430
different quotes are on that it's is uh
sometimes obsessing about this

6512
01:43:37,430 --> 01:43:37,440
sometimes obsessing about this
 

6513
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:40,070

01:43:42,709 --> 01:43:42,719
it's efficient like for somebody like uh
 

6519
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:44,629
it's efficient like for somebody like uh
if you're if you're trying to optimize

6520
01:43:44,629 --> 01:43:44,639
if you're if you're trying to optimize
 

6521
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:46,310
if you're if you're trying to optimize
your path i mean i agree premature

6522
01:43:46,310 --> 01:43:46,320
your path i mean i agree premature
 

6523
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:47,510
your path i mean i agree premature
optimization

6524
01:43:47,510 --> 01:43:47,520
optimization
 

6525
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:49,189
optimization
creates all kinds of challenges right

6526
01:43:49,189 --> 01:43:49,199
creates all kinds of challenges right

let's give dude i think or take that to

6534
01:43:57,430 --> 01:43:57,440
let's give dude i think or take that to
 

6535
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:58,950
let's give dude i think or take that to
somebody else

6536
01:43:58,950 --> 01:43:58,960
somebody else
 

6537
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:00,629
somebody else
well doc newt is kind of like mark twain

6538
01:44:00,629 --> 01:44:00,639
well doc newt is kind of like mark twain
 

6539
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:02,709
well doc newt is kind of like mark twain
people just attribute it don't matter

6540
01:44:02,709 --> 01:44:02,719
people just attribute it don't matter
 

6541
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:06,229
people just attribute it don't matter
and it's fine because brilliant so no i

6542
01:44:06,229 --> 01:44:06,239
and it's fine because brilliant so no i
 

6543
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:07,990
and it's fine because brilliant so no i
was a tech user myself and so i have a

6544
01:44:07,990 --> 01:44:08,000
was a tech user myself and so i have a
 

6545
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,310
was a tech user myself and so i have a
lot of respect and he did more than that

6546
01:44:10,310 --> 01:44:10,320
lot of respect and he did more than that
 

6547
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:11,510
lot of respect and he did more than that
of course but

6548
01:44:11,510 --> 01:44:11,520
of course but
 

6549
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:12,870
of course but
uh yeah

6550
01:44:12,870 --> 01:44:12,880
uh yeah
 

6551
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:14,149
uh yeah
someone i really appreciate in the

6552
01:44:14,149 --> 01:44:14,159
someone i really appreciate in the
 

6553
01:44:14,159 --> 01:44:16,229
someone i really appreciate in the
computer science space yeah i don't i

6554
01:44:16,229 --> 01:44:16,239
computer science space yeah i don't i
 

6555
01:44:16,239 --> 01:44:17,270
computer science space yeah i don't i
think that's appropriate there's a lot

6556
01:44:17,270 --> 01:44:17,280
think that's appropriate there's a lot
 

6557
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:18,790
think that's appropriate there's a lot
of little things like that where people

6558
01:44:18,790 --> 01:44:18,800
of little things like that where people
 

6559
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,229
of little things like that where people
actually if you understood it you go

6560
01:44:20,229 --> 01:44:20,239
actually if you understood it you go
 

6561
01:44:20,239 --> 01:44:22,390
actually if you understood it you go
yeah of course that's the case yeah like

6562
01:44:22,390 --> 01:44:22,400
yeah of course that's the case yeah like
 

6563
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:24,310
yeah of course that's the case yeah like
and the other part and the other part i

6564
01:44:24,310 --> 01:44:24,320
and the other part and the other part i
 

6565
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:25,990
and the other part and the other part i
didn't mention and

6566
01:44:25,990 --> 01:44:26,000
didn't mention and
 

6567
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,830
didn't mention and
number was a thing we wrote early on and

6568
01:44:27,830 --> 01:44:27,840
number was a thing we wrote early on and
 

6569
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:29,109
number was a thing we wrote early on and
i was really excited by number because

6570
01:44:29,109 --> 01:44:29,119
i was really excited by number because
 

6571
01:44:29,119 --> 01:44:30,149
i was really excited by number because
it's something we wanted it was a

6572
01:44:30,149 --> 01:44:30,159
it's something we wanted it was a
 

6573
01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:32,390
it's something we wanted it was a
compiler for python syntax and i wanted

6574
01:44:32,390 --> 01:44:32,400
compiler for python syntax and i wanted
 

6575
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:35,430
compiler for python syntax and i wanted
it from the beginning of writing numpy

6576
01:44:35,430 --> 01:44:35,440
it from the beginning of writing numpy
 

6577
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:36,790
it from the beginning of writing numpy
because

6578
01:44:36,790 --> 01:44:36,800
because
 

6579
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:39,669
because
of this function question like

6580
01:44:39,669 --> 01:44:39,679
of this function question like
 

6581
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:42,070
of this function question like
taking the power of arrays is really

6582
01:44:42,070 --> 01:44:42,080
taking the power of arrays is really
 

6583
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:44,149
taking the power of arrays is really
that you can write functions using all

6584
01:44:44,149 --> 01:44:44,159
that you can write functions using all
 

6585
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:45,109
that you can write functions using all
of it

6586
01:44:45,109 --> 01:44:45,119
of it
 

6587
01:44:45,119 --> 01:44:47,030
of it
it has implicit looping right so you

6588
01:44:47,030 --> 01:44:47,040
it has implicit looping right so you
 

6589
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:48,870
it has implicit looping right so you
don't worry about this n-dimensional for

6590
01:44:48,870 --> 01:44:48,880
don't worry about this n-dimensional for
 

6591
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:50,709
don't worry about this n-dimensional for
loop with you know four loops four four

6592
01:44:50,709 --> 01:44:50,719
loop with you know four loops four four
 

6593
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:52,229
loop with you know four loops four four
statements you just say oh big

6594
01:44:52,229 --> 01:44:52,239
statements you just say oh big
 

6595
01:44:52,239 --> 01:44:53,990
statements you just say oh big
four-dimensional array i'm gonna do this

6596
01:44:53,990 --> 01:44:54,000
four-dimensional array i'm gonna do this
 

6597
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,750
four-dimensional array i'm gonna do this
operation this plus this minus this

6598
01:44:55,750 --> 01:44:55,760
operation this plus this minus this
 

6599
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:56,790
operation this plus this minus this
reduction

6600
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:56,800
reduction
 

6601
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:57,830
reduction
and you get this it's called

6602
01:44:57,830 --> 01:44:57,840
and you get this it's called
 

6603
01:44:57,840 --> 01:44:59,910
and you get this it's called
vectorization in other areas but you can

6604
01:44:59,910 --> 01:44:59,920
vectorization in other areas but you can
 

6605
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:01,669
vectorization in other areas but you can
basically think at a high level and get

6606
01:45:01,669 --> 01:45:01,679
basically think at a high level and get
 

6607
01:45:01,679 --> 01:45:03,669
basically think at a high level and get
massive amounts of computation done with

6608
01:45:03,669 --> 01:45:03,679

then it kind of unpacks the element and
 

6677
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:09,669
then it kind of unpacks the element and
then does the addition

01:47:28,470 --> 01:47:28,480
them but that hasn't happened
 

6767
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:31,350
them but that hasn't happened
right and so their default is to use is

6768
01:47:31,350 --> 01:47:31,360
right and so their default is to use is
 

6769
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:33,030
right and so their default is to use is
to coerce the arrays together to a zero

6770
01:47:33,030 --> 01:47:33,040
to coerce the arrays together to a zero
 

6771
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:33,990
to coerce the arrays together to a zero
dimensional array and then use the

6772
01:47:33,990 --> 01:47:34,000
dimensional array and then use the
 

6773
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,709
dimensional array and then use the
number the numpy machinery that's what

6774
01:47:36,709 --> 01:47:36,719
number the numpy machinery that's what
 

6775
01:47:36,719 --> 01:47:38,870
number the numpy machinery that's what
and you could specialize but it doesn't

6776
01:47:38,870 --> 01:47:38,880
and you could specialize but it doesn't
 

6777
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:40,550
and you could specialize but it doesn't
happen all the time so in fact when we

6778
01:47:40,550 --> 01:47:40,560
happen all the time so in fact when we
 

6779
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:42,470
happen all the time so in fact when we
first wrote number we'd do comparisons

6780
01:47:42,470 --> 01:47:42,480
first wrote number we'd do comparisons
 

6781
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:45,590
first wrote number we'd do comparisons
and say look it's a thousand x speed up

6782
01:47:45,590 --> 01:47:45,600
and say look it's a thousand x speed up
 

6783
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:46,870
and say look it's a thousand x speed up
we're lying a little bit in the sense

6784
01:47:46,870 --> 01:47:46,880
we're lying a little bit in the sense
 

6785
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:48,870
we're lying a little bit in the sense
that well first do with the

6786
01:47:48,870 --> 01:47:48,880
that well first do with the
 

6787
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:51,030
that well first do with the
the 40x slowdown of using array scalers

6788
01:47:51,030 --> 01:47:51,040
the 40x slowdown of using array scalers
 

6789
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:52,550
the 40x slowdown of using array scalers
inside of a loop because if you used to

6790
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:52,560
inside of a loop because if you used to
 

6791
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:54,629
inside of a loop because if you used to
use python scalars you'd already be

6792
01:47:54,629 --> 01:47:54,639
use python scalars you'd already be
 

6793
01:47:54,639 --> 01:47:56,870
use python scalars you'd already be
10 times faster yeah but then we would

6794
01:47:56,870 --> 01:47:56,880
10 times faster yeah but then we would
 

6795
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:58,550
10 times faster yeah but then we would
get 100 times faster over that using

6796
01:47:58,550 --> 01:47:58,560
get 100 times faster over that using
 

6797
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:00,070
get 100 times faster over that using
just compilation

6798
01:48:00,070 --> 01:48:00,080
just compilation
 

6799
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:01,590
just compilation
but what we do is compile the loop from

6800
01:48:01,590 --> 01:48:01,600
but what we do is compile the loop from
 

6801
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:03,910
but what we do is compile the loop from
out of the interpreter to machine code

6802
01:48:03,910 --> 01:48:03,920
out of the interpreter to machine code
 

6803
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:05,669
out of the interpreter to machine code
and then that's always been the power of

6804
01:48:05,669 --> 01:48:05,679
and then that's always been the power of
 

6805
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:08,149
and then that's always been the power of
python is this extensibility so you can

6806
01:48:08,149 --> 01:48:08,159
python is this extensibility so you can
 

6807
01:48:08,159 --> 01:48:10,310
python is this extensibility so you can
people say oh python's so slow well sure

6808
01:48:10,310 --> 01:48:10,320
people say oh python's so slow well sure
 

6809
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:11,990
people say oh python's so slow well sure
if you do all your logic in the runtime

6810
01:48:11,990 --> 01:48:12,000
if you do all your logic in the runtime
 

6811
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,070
if you do all your logic in the runtime
of the python interpreter yeah but the

6812
01:48:14,070 --> 01:48:14,080
of the python interpreter yeah but the
 

6813
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:15,990
of the python interpreter yeah but the
power is that you don't have to you

6814
01:48:15,990 --> 01:48:16,000
power is that you don't have to you
 

6815
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,910
power is that you don't have to you
write all the logic which you do in the

6816
01:48:17,910 --> 01:48:17,920
write all the logic which you do in the
 

6817
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:19,830
write all the logic which you do in the
high level is just high level logic and

6818
01:48:19,830 --> 01:48:19,840
high level is just high level logic and
 

6819
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:21,990
high level is just high level logic and
the the actual calls you're making could

6820
01:48:21,990 --> 01:48:22,000
the the actual calls you're making could
 

6821
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:22,950
the the actual calls you're making could
be on

6822
01:48:22,950 --> 01:48:22,960
be on
 

6823
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:24,709
be on
gigabyte arrays of data and that's all

6824
01:48:24,709 --> 01:48:24,719
gigabyte arrays of data and that's all
 

6825
01:48:24,719 --> 01:48:26,709
gigabyte arrays of data and that's all
done at compiled speeds

6826
01:48:26,709 --> 01:48:26,719
done at compiled speeds
 

6827
01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:29,030
done at compiled speeds
and the fact that integration is

6828
01:48:29,030 --> 01:48:29,040
and the fact that integration is
 

6829
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:32,229
and the fact that integration is
one can happen but two is separable

6830
01:48:32,229 --> 01:48:32,239
one can happen but two is separable
 

6831
01:48:32,239 --> 01:48:34,390
one can happen but two is separable
that's one of the uh their language like

6832
01:48:34,390 --> 01:48:34,400
that's one of the uh their language like
 

6833
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:36,310
that's one of the uh their language like
julia says we're gonna be all in one you

6834
01:48:36,310 --> 01:48:36,320
julia says we're gonna be all in one you
 

6835
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:37,430
julia says we're gonna be all in one you
can do all of it together and then

6836
01:48:37,430 --> 01:48:37,440
can do all of it together and then
 

6837
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:39,750
can do all of it together and then
there's the jury's out is that possible

6838
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:39,760
there's the jury's out is that possible
 

6839
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:41,669
there's the jury's out is that possible
i tend to think that you're gonna

there's separate concerns there you want

6842
01:48:43,510 --> 01:48:43,520
there's separate concerns there you want
 

6843
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:45,270
there's separate concerns there you want
to pre-compile them but generally you

6844
01:48:45,270 --> 01:48:45,280
to pre-compile them but generally you
 

6845
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:47,430
to pre-compile them but generally you
will want to pre-compile your

6846
01:48:47,430 --> 01:48:47,440
will want to pre-compile your
 

6847
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:49,189
will want to pre-compile your
some of your loops like scipy is a

6848
01:48:49,189 --> 01:48:49,199
some of your loops like scipy is a
 

6849
01:48:49,199 --> 01:48:51,189
some of your loops like scipy is a
compilation step to install sci-fi it

6850
01:48:51,189 --> 01:48:51,199
compilation step to install sci-fi it
 

6851
01:48:51,199 --> 01:48:53,510
compilation step to install sci-fi it
takes about two hours if you have many

6852
01:48:53,510 --> 01:48:53,520
takes about two hours if you have many
 

6853
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:54,790
takes about two hours if you have many
machines maybe you can get it down to

6854
01:48:54,790 --> 01:48:54,800
machines maybe you can get it down to
 

6855
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:56,550
machines maybe you can get it down to
one hour but to compile those libraries

6856
01:48:56,550 --> 01:48:56,560
one hour but to compile those libraries
 

6857
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:58,070
one hour but to compile those libraries
takes about takes a while you don't want

6858
01:48:58,070 --> 01:48:58,080
takes about takes a while you don't want
 

6859
01:48:58,080 --> 01:48:59,669
takes about takes a while you don't want
to do that at runtime

6860
01:48:59,669 --> 01:48:59,679
to do that at runtime
 

6861
01:48:59,679 --> 01:49:00,790
to do that at runtime
you don't do that all the time you want

6862
01:49:00,790 --> 01:49:00,800
you don't do that all the time you want
 

6863
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,149
you don't do that all the time you want
to have this precompiled binary

6864
01:49:02,149 --> 01:49:02,159
to have this precompiled binary
 

6865
01:49:02,159 --> 01:49:03,510
to have this precompiled binary
available that you're then just linking

01:49:03,510 --> 01:49:03,520
available that you're then just linking
 

6867
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:06,470
available that you're then just linking
into so there's real questions about

01:49:06,470 --> 01:49:06,480
into so there's real questions about
 

6869
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:08,950

01:49:08,950 --> 01:49:08,960
the whole you know source code
 

6871
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:11,030
the whole you know source code
code is running binary code is more than

code is running binary code is more than
 

6873
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:13,030
code is running binary code is more than

6875
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:14,629
source code it's created object code
it's the linker it's the loader it's the

01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:17,830
how does that interpret it inside the
virtual memory space there's a lot of

01:49:17,830 --> 01:49:17,840
virtual memory space there's a lot of
 

6881
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:19,350
virtual memory space there's a lot of

and you can do more details but
 

6893
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:31,109
and you can do more details but
sometimes it helps with abstractions too

6894

sometimes it helps with abstractions too
 

6895
01:49:31,119 --> 01:49:33,270
sometimes it helps with abstractions too
well the problem as we mentioned earlier

01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:35,189
well the problem as we mentioned earlier
with abstractions is you kind of

01:50:00,159 --> 01:50:01,830
fell in love with it is dictionaries yes
um so

6922
01:50:01,830 --> 01:50:01,840
um so
 

6923
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:03,830
um so
obviously probably most languages have

6924
01:50:03,830 --> 01:50:03,840
obviously probably most languages have
 

6925
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:04,870
obviously probably most languages have
some

6926
01:50:04,870 --> 01:50:04,880
some
 

6927
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:07,030
some
concepts some mapping concept but it

6928
01:50:07,030 --> 01:50:07,040
concepts some mapping concept but it
 

6929
01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:08,870
concepts some mapping concept but it
felt like it was a first class citizen

6930
01:50:08,870 --> 01:50:08,880
felt like it was a first class citizen
 

6931
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:10,550
felt like it was a first class citizen
and it was just my brain was able to

6932
01:50:10,550 --> 01:50:10,560
and it was just my brain was able to
 

6933
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:12,950
and it was just my brain was able to
think in dictionaries but then there's

6934
01:50:12,950 --> 01:50:12,960
think in dictionaries but then there's
 

6935
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:14,629
think in dictionaries but then there's
the thing that i guess i still use to

6936
01:50:14,629 --> 01:50:14,639
the thing that i guess i still use to
 

6937
01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:16,950
the thing that i guess i still use to
this day is order dictionaries

6938
01:50:16,950 --> 01:50:16,960
this day is order dictionaries
 

6939
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:19,830
this day is order dictionaries
because that seems like a more natural

6940
01:50:19,830 --> 01:50:19,840
because that seems like a more natural
 

6941
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:21,910
because that seems like a more natural
way to construct dictionaries yeah and

6942
01:50:21,910 --> 01:50:21,920
way to construct dictionaries yeah and
 

6943
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:23,589
way to construct dictionaries yeah and
and from a computer science perspective

6944
01:50:23,589 --> 01:50:23,599
and from a computer science perspective
 

6945
01:50:23,599 --> 01:50:25,030
and from a computer science perspective
the running time cost is not that

6946
01:50:25,030 --> 01:50:25,040
the running time cost is not that
 

6947
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:27,350
the running time cost is not that
significant but there's a lot of things

6948
01:50:27,350 --> 01:50:27,360
significant but there's a lot of things
 

6949
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:30,390
significant but there's a lot of things
to understand about dictionaries

6950
01:50:30,390 --> 01:50:30,400
to understand about dictionaries
 

6951
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:31,270
to understand about dictionaries
that

6952
01:50:31,270 --> 01:50:31,280
that
 

6953
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:33,830
that
the abstraction kind of

6954
01:50:33,830 --> 01:50:33,840
the abstraction kind of
 

6955
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:35,750
the abstraction kind of
doesn't necessarily incentivize you to

6956
01:50:35,750 --> 01:50:35,760
doesn't necessarily incentivize you to
 

6957
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:37,270
doesn't necessarily incentivize you to
understand

6958
01:50:37,270 --> 01:50:37,280
understand
 

6959
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:38,310
understand
right do you really understand the

6960
01:50:38,310 --> 01:50:38,320
right do you really understand the
 

6961
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:39,669
right do you really understand the
notion of a hashmap and how that

6962
01:50:39,669 --> 01:50:39,679
notion of a hashmap and how that
 

6963
01:50:39,679 --> 01:50:41,270
notion of a hashmap and how that
dictionary is implemented but you're

6964
01:50:41,270 --> 01:50:41,280
dictionary is implemented but you're
 

6965
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:43,430
dictionary is implemented but you're
right dictionaries are a good example of

6966
01:50:43,430 --> 01:50:43,440
right dictionaries are a good example of
 

6967
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:44,950
right dictionaries are a good example of
an abstraction that's powerful and i

6968
01:50:44,950 --> 01:50:44,960
an abstraction that's powerful and i
 

6969
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:46,629
an abstraction that's powerful and i
agree with you one of the love i agree i

6970
01:50:46,629 --> 01:50:46,639
agree with you one of the love i agree i
 

6971
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:48,070
agree with you one of the love i agree i
love dictionaries too it took me a while

6972
01:50:48,070 --> 01:50:48,080
love dictionaries too it took me a while
 

6973
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:49,109
love dictionaries too it took me a while
to understand that once you do you

6974
01:50:49,109 --> 01:50:49,119
to understand that once you do you
 

6975
01:50:49,119 --> 01:50:50,950
to understand that once you do you
realize oh they're everywhere and python

6976
01:50:50,950 --> 01:50:50,960
realize oh they're everywhere and python
 

6977
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:53,109
realize oh they're everywhere and python
uses them everywhere too like it's

6978
01:50:53,109 --> 01:50:53,119
uses them everywhere too like it's
 

6979
01:50:53,119 --> 01:50:54,390
uses them everywhere too like it's
actually constructed that one of the

6980
01:50:54,390 --> 01:50:54,400
actually constructed that one of the
 

6981
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:55,669
actually constructed that one of the
foundational things is dictionaries and

6982
01:50:55,669 --> 01:50:55,679
foundational things is dictionaries and
 

6983
01:50:55,679 --> 01:50:57,589
foundational things is dictionaries and
it does everything with x-rays yeah so

6984
01:50:57,589 --> 01:50:57,599
it does everything with x-rays yeah so
 

6985
01:50:57,599 --> 01:50:59,189
it does everything with x-rays yeah so
it is it's powerful order dictionaries

6986
01:50:59,189 --> 01:50:59,199
it is it's powerful order dictionaries
 

6987
01:50:59,199 --> 01:51:02,149
it is it's powerful order dictionaries
came later but it is very very powerful

6988
01:51:02,149 --> 01:51:02,159
came later but it is very very powerful
 

6989
01:51:02,159 --> 01:51:03,990
came later but it is very very powerful
it took me a little while coming from

6990
01:51:03,990 --> 01:51:04,000
it took me a little while coming from
 

6991
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,070
it took me a little while coming from
just the array programming entirely to

6992
01:51:06,070 --> 01:51:06,080
just the array programming entirely to
 

6993
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:07,430
just the array programming entirely to
understand these other objects like

6994
01:51:07,430 --> 01:51:07,440
understand these other objects like
 

6995
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:09,350
understand these other objects like
dictionaries and lists and

6996
01:51:09,350 --> 01:51:09,360
dictionaries and lists and
 

6997
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:11,430
dictionaries and lists and
tuples and binary trees

6998
01:51:11,430 --> 01:51:11,440
tuples and binary trees
 

6999
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:12,470
tuples and binary trees
like i said i wasn't a computer

7000
01:51:12,470 --> 01:51:12,480
like i said i wasn't a computer
 

7001
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:15,030
like i said i wasn't a computer
scientist so i studied a raise first and

7002
01:51:15,030 --> 01:51:15,040
scientist so i studied a raise first and
 

7003
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:16,950
scientist so i studied a raise first and
so i was very erase-centric and you

7004
01:51:16,950 --> 01:51:16,960
so i was very erase-centric and you
 

7005
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:18,390
so i was very erase-centric and you
realize oh these others don't have

7006
01:51:18,390 --> 01:51:18,400
realize oh these others don't have
 

7007
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:20,390
realize oh these others don't have
purposes and value actually

7008
01:51:20,390 --> 01:51:20,400
purposes and value actually
 

7009
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:24,149
purposes and value actually
um i agree there's a friendliness about

7010
01:51:24,149 --> 01:51:24,159
um i agree there's a friendliness about
 

7011
01:51:24,159 --> 01:51:26,709
um i agree there's a friendliness about
like one way to think about a raise

7012
01:51:26,709 --> 01:51:26,719
like one way to think about a raise
 

7013
01:51:26,719 --> 01:51:28,070
like one way to think about a raise
is um

7014
01:51:28,070 --> 01:51:28,080
is um
 

7015
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:29,430
is um
arrays are just

7016
01:51:29,430 --> 01:51:29,440
arrays are just
 

7017
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:31,750
arrays are just
not like full of numbers

7018
01:51:31,750 --> 01:51:31,760
not like full of numbers
 

7019
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:34,950
not like full of numbers
but to make them accessible to humans

7020
01:51:34,950 --> 01:51:34,960
but to make them accessible to humans
 

7021
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:37,669
but to make them accessible to humans
and make them less error-prone to human

7022
01:51:37,669 --> 01:51:37,679
and make them less error-prone to human
 

7023
01:51:37,679 --> 01:51:41,350
and make them less error-prone to human
users sometimes you want to attach names

7024
01:51:41,350 --> 01:51:41,360
users sometimes you want to attach names
 

7025
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:43,189
users sometimes you want to attach names
human interpretable names

7026
01:51:43,189 --> 01:51:43,199
human interpretable names
 

7027
01:51:43,199 --> 01:51:45,189
human interpretable names
that are sticky to those arrays so yeah

7028
01:51:45,189 --> 01:51:45,199
that are sticky to those arrays so yeah
 

7029
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:46,470
that are sticky to those arrays so yeah
that's how you start to think about

7030
01:51:46,470 --> 01:51:46,480
that's how you start to think about
 

7031
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:48,470
that's how you start to think about
dictionaries yes

7032
01:51:48,470 --> 01:51:48,480
dictionaries yes
 

7033
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:50,629
dictionaries yes
you start to convert numbers into

7034
01:51:50,629 --> 01:51:50,639
you start to convert numbers into
 

7035
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:52,070
you start to convert numbers into
something that's human interpretable and

7036
01:51:52,070 --> 01:51:52,080
something that's human interpretable and
 

7037
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:53,830
something that's human interpretable and
that's actually the tension i've had

7038
01:51:53,830 --> 01:51:53,840
that's actually the tension i've had
 

7039
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:56,709
that's actually the tension i've had
correct with numpy because correct i've

7040
01:51:56,709 --> 01:51:56,719
correct with numpy because correct i've
 

7041
01:51:56,719 --> 01:51:59,189
correct with numpy because correct i've
built so much tooling around

7042
01:51:59,189 --> 01:51:59,199
built so much tooling around
 

7043
01:51:59,199 --> 01:52:00,629
built so much tooling around
human uh

7044
01:52:00,629 --> 01:52:00,639
human uh
 

7045
01:52:00,639 --> 01:52:03,030
human uh
human interpretability and also

7046
01:52:03,030 --> 01:52:03,040
human interpretability and also
 

7047
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:04,470
human interpretability and also
protecting me

7048
01:52:04,470 --> 01:52:04,480
protecting me
 

7049
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:06,229
protecting me
from a year later not making the

7050
01:52:06,229 --> 01:52:06,239
from a year later not making the
 

7051
01:52:06,239 --> 01:52:08,790
from a year later not making the
mistakes by being i wanted to force

7052
01:52:08,790 --> 01:52:08,800
mistakes by being i wanted to force
 

7053
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:11,830
mistakes by being i wanted to force
myself to use english versus uh

7054
01:52:11,830 --> 01:52:11,840
myself to use english versus uh
 

7055
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:12,870
myself to use english versus uh
numbers

7056
01:52:12,870 --> 01:52:12,880
numbers
 

7057
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:14,229
numbers
yes so there's a there's a project

7058
01:52:14,229 --> 01:52:14,239
yes so there's a there's a project
 

7059
01:52:14,239 --> 01:52:16,470
yes so there's a there's a project
called labeled arrays like very

7060
01:52:16,470 --> 01:52:16,480
called labeled arrays like very
 

7061
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:18,950
called labeled arrays like very
early it was recognized that oh we need

7062
01:52:18,950 --> 01:52:18,960
early it was recognized that oh we need
 

7063
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:20,550
early it was recognized that oh we need
we we're indexing numpy we're just

7064
01:52:20,550 --> 01:52:20,560
we we're indexing numpy we're just
 

7065
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:22,870
we we're indexing numpy we're just
numbers all the columns and particularly

7066
01:52:22,870 --> 01:52:22,880
numbers all the columns and particularly
 

7067
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:24,709
numbers all the columns and particularly
the dimensions i mean if you have an

7068
01:52:24,709 --> 01:52:24,719
the dimensions i mean if you have an
 

7069
01:52:24,719 --> 01:52:26,070
the dimensions i mean if you have an
image you don't necessarily need to

7070
01:52:26,070 --> 01:52:26,080
image you don't necessarily need to
 

7071
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:28,070
image you don't necessarily need to
label each column or row but if you have

7072
01:52:28,070 --> 01:52:28,080
label each column or row but if you have
 

7073
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:29,510
label each column or row but if you have
a lot of images so you have another

7074
01:52:29,510 --> 01:52:29,520
a lot of images so you have another
 

7075
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:31,189
a lot of images so you have another
dimension you at least like to label the

7076
01:52:31,189 --> 01:52:31,199
dimension you at least like to label the
 

7077
01:52:31,199 --> 01:52:33,109
dimension you at least like to label the
dimension as this is x this is y z or

7078
01:52:33,109 --> 01:52:33,119
dimension as this is x this is y z or
 

7079
01:52:33,119 --> 01:52:34,709
dimension as this is x this is y z or
this is give us some human meaning or

7080
01:52:34,709 --> 01:52:34,719
this is give us some human meaning or
 

7081
01:52:34,719 --> 01:52:36,709
this is give us some human meaning or
some domain circle meaning

7082
01:52:36,709 --> 01:52:36,719
some domain circle meaning
 

7083
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:39,030
some domain circle meaning
that was one of the impetuses for pandas

7084
01:52:39,030 --> 01:52:39,040
that was one of the impetuses for pandas
 

7085
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:41,830
that was one of the impetuses for pandas
actually was just oh we do need to label

7086
01:52:41,830 --> 01:52:41,840
actually was just oh we do need to label
 

7087
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:42,870
actually was just oh we do need to label
these things

7088
01:52:42,870 --> 01:52:42,880
these things
 

7089
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:44,790
these things
and label label array was an attempt to

7090
01:52:44,790 --> 01:52:44,800
and label label array was an attempt to
 

7091
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:47,189
and label label array was an attempt to
add that like a lighter weight version

7092
01:52:47,189 --> 01:52:47,199
add that like a lighter weight version
 

7093
01:52:47,199 --> 01:52:48,629
add that like a lighter weight version
of that and there's been like that's an

7094
01:52:48,629 --> 01:52:48,639
of that and there's been like that's an
 

7095
01:52:48,639 --> 01:52:50,070
of that and there's been like that's an
example of something i think numpy could

7096
01:52:50,070 --> 01:52:50,080
example of something i think numpy could
 

7097
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:51,030
example of something i think numpy could
add

7098
01:52:51,030 --> 01:52:51,040
add
 

7099
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:52,870
add
could be added to numpy

7100
01:52:52,870 --> 01:52:52,880
could be added to numpy
 

7101
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:54,310
could be added to numpy
but one of the challenges again how do

7102
01:52:54,310 --> 01:52:54,320
but one of the challenges again how do
 

7103
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:55,830
but one of the challenges again how do
you fund this like like i said one of

7104
01:52:55,830 --> 01:52:55,840
you fund this like like i said one of
 

7105
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:58,950
you fund this like like i said one of
the tragedies i think is that so i i

7106
01:52:58,950 --> 01:52:58,960
the tragedies i think is that so i i
 

7107
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:00,790
the tragedies i think is that so i i
never had the chance to i was never paid

7108
01:53:00,790 --> 01:53:00,800
never had the chance to i was never paid
 

7109
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:03,189
never had the chance to i was never paid
to work on empire right so i've always

7110
01:53:03,189 --> 01:53:03,199
to work on empire right so i've always
 

7111
01:53:03,199 --> 01:53:05,109
to work on empire right so i've always
just done in my spare time always taken

7112
01:53:05,109 --> 01:53:05,119
just done in my spare time always taken
 

7113
01:53:05,119 --> 01:53:06,629
just done in my spare time always taken
from one thing taken from another thing

7114
01:53:06,629 --> 01:53:06,639
from one thing taken from another thing
 

7115
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:07,669
from one thing taken from another thing
to do it

7116
01:53:07,669 --> 01:53:07,679
to do it
 

7117
01:53:07,679 --> 01:53:09,910
to do it
and at the time i mean today it would be

7118
01:53:09,910 --> 01:53:09,920
and at the time i mean today it would be
 

7119
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:11,510
and at the time i mean today it would be
the wrong time today like pay me to work

7120
01:53:11,510 --> 01:53:11,520
the wrong time today like pay me to work
 

7121
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:13,030
the wrong time today like pay me to work
on empire now would not be a good use of

7122
01:53:13,030 --> 01:53:13,040
on empire now would not be a good use of
 

7123
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:14,149
on empire now would not be a good use of
effort but

7124
01:53:14,149 --> 01:53:14,159
effort but
 

7125
01:53:14,159 --> 01:53:16,629
effort but
but we are finally at quansite labs i'm

7126
01:53:16,629 --> 01:53:16,639
but we are finally at quansite labs i'm
 

7127
01:53:16,639 --> 01:53:18,229
but we are finally at quansite labs i'm
actually paying people to work on numpy

7128
01:53:18,229 --> 01:53:18,239
actually paying people to work on numpy
 

7129
01:53:18,239 --> 01:53:20,470
actually paying people to work on numpy
and scipy which is i'm thrilled with i'm

7130
01:53:20,470 --> 01:53:20,480
and scipy which is i'm thrilled with i'm
 

7131
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:22,629
and scipy which is i'm thrilled with i'm
excited by uh i've wanted to do that

7132
01:53:22,629 --> 01:53:22,639
excited by uh i've wanted to do that
 

7133
01:53:22,639 --> 01:53:24,149
excited by uh i've wanted to do that
it's what i wanted to do from day one it

7134
01:53:24,149 --> 01:53:24,159
it's what i wanted to do from day one it
 

7135
01:53:24,159 --> 01:53:25,589
it's what i wanted to do from day one it
just took me a while

7136
01:53:25,589 --> 01:53:25,599
just took me a while
 

7137
01:53:25,599 --> 01:53:27,510
just took me a while
to figure out a mechanism to do that

7138
01:53:27,510 --> 01:53:27,520
to figure out a mechanism to do that
 

7139
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:29,589
to figure out a mechanism to do that
even like in the university setting

7140
01:53:29,589 --> 01:53:29,599
even like in the university setting
 

7141
01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:32,390
even like in the university setting
respecting that from like

7142
01:53:32,390 --> 01:53:32,400
respecting that from like
 

7143
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:35,030
respecting that from like

graduate students to contribute
 

7147
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:40,390
graduate students to contribute
and then figuring out financial uh

7148
01:53:40,390 --> 01:53:40,400
and then figuring out financial uh
 

7149
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:42,229
and then figuring out financial uh
mechanisms that enable them to

7150
01:53:42,229 --> 01:53:42,239
mechanisms that enable them to
 

7151
01:53:42,239 --> 01:53:45,109
mechanisms that enable them to
contribute and then sort of reward them

7152
01:53:45,109 --> 01:53:45,119
contribute and then sort of reward them
 

7153
01:53:45,119 --> 01:53:46,470
contribute and then sort of reward them
for their um

7154
01:53:46,470 --> 01:53:46,480
for their um
 

7155
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:48,229
for their um
innovative scientific journey that that

7156
01:53:48,229 --> 01:53:48,239
innovative scientific journey that that
 

7157
01:53:48,239 --> 01:53:50,470
innovative scientific journey that that
would be nice but then also just the

7158
01:53:50,470 --> 01:53:50,480
would be nice but then also just the
 

7159
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:52,709
would be nice but then also just the
better allocation of resources

7160
01:53:52,709 --> 01:53:52,719
better allocation of resources
 

7161
01:53:52,719 --> 01:53:54,790
better allocation of resources
well you know it's 20-year anniversary

7162
01:53:54,790 --> 01:53:54,800
well you know it's 20-year anniversary
 

7163
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:57,030

since 9 11 and i was just looking we

7164
01:53:57,030 --> 01:53:57,040
since 9 11 and i was just looking we
 

7165
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:59,589
since 9 11 and i was just looking we
spent over six trillion dollars in in

7166
01:53:59,589 --> 01:53:59,599
spent over six trillion dollars in in
 

7167
01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:02,310
spent over six trillion dollars in in
the middle east after 9 11

7168
01:54:02,310 --> 01:54:02,320
the middle east after 9 11
 

7169
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:05,350
the middle east after 9 11
in the various efforts there and sort of

7170
01:54:05,350 --> 01:54:05,360
in the various efforts there and sort of
 

7171
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:06,149
in the various efforts there and sort of
to

to
 

7173
01:54:06,159 --> 01:54:08,070
to
put politics and all that aside it's

7174

put politics and all that aside it's
 

7175
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:09,669
put politics and all that aside it's
just you think about the education

7176
01:54:09,669 --> 01:54:09,679
just you think about the education
 

7177
01:54:09,679 --> 01:54:11,189
just you think about the education
system all the other ways we could have

7178
01:54:11,189 --> 01:54:11,199
system all the other ways we could have
 

7179
01:54:11,199 --> 01:54:14,149
system all the other ways we could have
possibly allocated that money

7180
01:54:14,149 --> 01:54:14,159
possibly allocated that money
 

7181
01:54:14,159 --> 01:54:18,229
possibly allocated that money
to me yeah to take it back

7182
01:54:18,229 --> 01:54:18,239

 

7183
01:54:18,239 --> 01:54:21,350

the amount of impact you would have by

7184
01:54:21,350 --> 01:54:21,360
the amount of impact you would have by
 

7185
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:24,629
the amount of impact you would have by
allocating a little bit of money to uh

7186
01:54:24,629 --> 01:54:24,639
allocating a little bit of money to uh
 

7187
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:26,870
allocating a little bit of money to uh
the programmers yeah that build the

7188
01:54:26,870 --> 01:54:26,880
the programmers yeah that build the
 

7189
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:29,990
the programmers yeah that build the
tools that run the world is fascinating

7190
01:54:29,990 --> 01:54:30,000
tools that run the world is fascinating
 

7191
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,070
tools that run the world is fascinating
i mean it is i

7192
01:54:32,070 --> 01:54:32,080
i mean it is i
 

7193
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:33,510
i mean it is i
it i don't know

7194
01:54:33,510 --> 01:54:33,520
it i don't know
 

7195
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:36,070
it i don't know
i think uh again there is some aspect to

7196
01:54:36,070 --> 01:54:36,080
i think uh again there is some aspect to
 

7197
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:37,910
i think uh again there is some aspect to
uh being broke

7198
01:54:37,910 --> 01:54:37,920
uh being broke
 

7199
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:40,950
uh being broke

now i know i it's so i but i don't think

7204
01:54:46,070 --> 01:54:46,080
now i know i it's so i but i don't think
 

7205
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:48,709
now i know i it's so i but i don't think
that's a big part so it's like i think

7206
01:54:48,709 --> 01:54:48,719
that's a big part so it's like i think
 

7207
01:54:48,719 --> 01:54:50,790
that's a big part so it's like i think
you can you can have enough money and

7208
01:54:50,790 --> 01:54:50,800
you can you can have enough money and
 

7209
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:52,629
you can you can have enough money and

one thing i love about open source is
 

7227
01:55:05,679 --> 01:55:07,910
one thing i love about open source is
it's global it's multinational like

it's global it's multinational like
 

7229
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:09,270
it's global it's multinational like
there aren't national boundaries one of

there aren't national boundaries one of
 

7231

there aren't national boundaries one of
the challenges with business and open

the challenges with business and open
 

7233
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:11,910
the challenges with business and open
source is the fact that business is

01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:21,270
are respected in those jurisdictions and
hiring and yet the open source ecosystem

7244
01:55:21,270 --> 01:55:21,280
hiring and yet the open source ecosystem
 

7245
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:23,109
hiring and yet the open source ecosystem
is not it's not it's not there like

7246
01:55:23,109 --> 01:55:23,119
is not it's not it's not there like
 

7247
01:55:23,119 --> 01:55:24,629
is not it's not it's not there like
currently one of the problems we're

7248
01:55:24,629 --> 01:55:24,639
currently one of the problems we're
 

7249
01:55:24,639 --> 01:55:26,070
currently one of the problems we're
solving is hiring people all over the

7250
01:55:26,070 --> 01:55:26,080
solving is hiring people all over the
 

7251
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:26,870
solving is hiring people all over the
world

7252
01:55:26,870 --> 01:55:26,880
world
 

7253
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:28,149
world
right because we

7254
01:55:28,149 --> 01:55:28,159
right because we
 

7255
01:55:28,159 --> 01:55:29,910
right because we
it's a global effort and i've had the

7256
01:55:29,910 --> 01:55:29,920
it's a global effort and i've had the
 

7257
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:31,830
it's a global effort and i've had the
chance to work and i've loved the chance

7258
01:55:31,830 --> 01:55:31,840
chance to work and i've loved the chance
 

7259

i've never been to uh like a iran but i

7260
01:55:35,350 --> 01:55:35,360
i've never been to uh like a iran but i
 

7261
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:37,189
i've never been to uh like a iran but i
once had a conference i was able to talk

7262
01:55:37,189 --> 01:55:37,199
once had a conference i was able to talk
 

7263
01:55:37,199 --> 01:55:39,589
once had a conference i was able to talk
to people there right and talk to folks

7264
01:55:39,589 --> 01:55:39,599
to people there right and talk to folks
 

7265
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:41,669
to people there right and talk to folks
in uh pakistan never been there but we

7266
01:55:41,669 --> 01:55:41,679
in uh pakistan never been there but we
 

7267
01:55:41,679 --> 01:55:43,510
in uh pakistan never been there but we
had a a

7268
01:55:43,510 --> 01:55:43,520
had a a
 

7269
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:45,510
had a a
call where there are people there like

7270
01:55:45,510 --> 01:55:45,520
call where there are people there like
 

7271
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:48,070
call where there are people there like
just scientists and normal people and

7272
01:55:48,070 --> 01:55:48,080
just scientists and normal people and
 

7273
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:49,750
just scientists and normal people and
you know and and it's there's a there's

7274
01:55:49,750 --> 01:55:49,760
you know and and it's there's a there's
 

7275
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:51,109
you know and and it's there's a there's
a certain amount of

7276
01:55:51,109 --> 01:55:51,119
a certain amount of
 

7277
01:55:51,119 --> 01:55:54,149
a certain amount of
humanizing right that gets away from the

7278
01:55:54,149 --> 01:55:54,159
humanizing right that gets away from the
 

7279
01:55:54,159 --> 01:55:56,070
humanizing right that gets away from the
like we often get the memes of society

7280
01:55:56,070 --> 01:55:56,080
like we often get the memes of society
 

7281
01:55:56,080 --> 01:55:58,390
like we often get the memes of society
that bubble up and get her get discussed

7282
01:55:58,390 --> 01:55:58,400
that bubble up and get her get discussed
 

7283
01:55:58,400 --> 01:56:00,149
that bubble up and get her get discussed
but the memes are not even an accurate

7284
01:56:00,149 --> 01:56:00,159
but the memes are not even an accurate
 

7285
01:56:00,159 --> 01:56:01,669
but the memes are not even an accurate
reflection of the reality of what people

7286
01:56:01,669 --> 01:56:01,679
reflection of the reality of what people
 

7287
01:56:01,679 --> 01:56:02,470
reflection of the reality of what people
are

7288
01:56:02,470 --> 01:56:02,480
are
 

7289
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:04,709
are
well if you look at the major power

7290
01:56:04,709 --> 01:56:04,719
well if you look at the major power
 

7291
01:56:04,719 --> 01:56:06,709
well if you look at the major power
centers that are leading to something

7292
01:56:06,709 --> 01:56:06,719
centers that are leading to something
 

7293
01:56:06,719 --> 01:56:09,910
centers that are leading to something
like cyber war in the next few decades

7294
01:56:09,910 --> 01:56:09,920
like cyber war in the next few decades
 

7295
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:12,870
like cyber war in the next few decades
it's united states it's russia and china

7296
01:56:12,870 --> 01:56:12,880
it's united states it's russia and china
 

7297
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:15,430
it's united states it's russia and china
right and th those three countries in

7298
01:56:15,430 --> 01:56:15,440
right and th those three countries in
 

7299
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:18,229
right and th those three countries in
particular have incredible developers

7300
01:56:18,229 --> 01:56:18,239
particular have incredible developers
 

7301
01:56:18,239 --> 01:56:20,390
particular have incredible developers
so if they work together yeah i think

7302
01:56:20,390 --> 01:56:20,400
so if they work together yeah i think
 

7303
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:22,229
so if they work together yeah i think
that's one way the politicians can do

7304
01:56:22,229 --> 01:56:22,239
that's one way the politicians can do
 

7305
01:56:22,239 --> 01:56:23,910
that's one way the politicians can do
their stupid bickering but like the

7306
01:56:23,910 --> 01:56:23,920
their stupid bickering but like the
 

7307
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:26,229
their stupid bickering but like the
there's a layer of infrastructure of

7308
01:56:26,229 --> 01:56:26,239
there's a layer of infrastructure of
 

7309
01:56:26,239 --> 01:56:28,390
there's a layer of infrastructure of
humanity yeah if they collaborate

7310
01:56:28,390 --> 01:56:28,400
humanity yeah if they collaborate
 

7311
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:30,950
humanity yeah if they collaborate
together that that i think can prevent

7312
01:56:30,950 --> 01:56:30,960
together that that i think can prevent
 

7313
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:33,109
together that that i think can prevent
major uh major

7314
01:56:33,109 --> 01:56:33,119
major uh major
 

7315
01:56:33,119 --> 01:56:35,189
major uh major
military conflict which would i think

7316
01:56:35,189 --> 01:56:35,199
military conflict which would i think
 

7317
01:56:35,199 --> 01:56:37,750
military conflict which would i think
most likely happen at the cyber level

7318
01:56:37,750 --> 01:56:37,760
most likely happen at the cyber level
 

7319
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:39,910
most likely happen at the cyber level
versus the actual hot war level you're

7320
01:56:39,910 --> 01:56:39,920
versus the actual hot war level you're
 

7321
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:41,669
versus the actual hot war level you're
right no i think that's good that's good

7322
01:56:41,669 --> 01:56:41,679
right no i think that's good that's good
 

7323
01:56:41,679 --> 01:56:43,270
right no i think that's good that's good
prediction

7324
01:56:43,270 --> 01:56:43,280
prediction
 

7325
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:45,510
prediction
nations that code together uh

7326
01:56:45,510 --> 01:56:45,520
nations that code together uh
 

7327
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:46,629
nations that code together uh
don't go to war yeah they don't go to

7328
01:56:46,629 --> 01:56:46,639
don't go to war yeah they don't go to
 

7329
01:56:46,639 --> 01:56:48,470
don't go to war yeah they don't go to
war together that's that's a hope right

7330
01:56:48,470 --> 01:56:48,480
war together that's that's a hope right
 

7331
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:50,229
war together that's that's a hope right
that's one of the philosophical hopes

7332
01:56:50,229 --> 01:56:50,239
that's one of the philosophical hopes
 

7333
01:56:50,239 --> 01:56:52,229
that's one of the philosophical hopes
but yeah

7334
01:56:52,229 --> 01:56:52,239
but yeah
 

7335
01:56:52,239 --> 01:56:54,149
but yeah
so you mentioned uh the project of

7336
01:56:54,149 --> 01:56:54,159
so you mentioned uh the project of
 

7337
01:56:54,159 --> 01:56:55,430
so you mentioned uh the project of
number

7338
01:56:55,430 --> 01:56:55,440
number
 

7339
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:57,669
number
which is um

7340
01:56:57,669 --> 01:56:57,679
which is um
 

7341
01:56:57,679 --> 01:56:59,750
which is um
fascinating so from the early days there

7342
01:56:59,750 --> 01:56:59,760
fascinating so from the early days there
 

7343
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:02,229
fascinating so from the early days there
was kind of a push back on python that

7344
01:57:02,229 --> 01:57:02,239
was kind of a push back on python that
 

7345
01:57:02,239 --> 01:57:04,390
was kind of a push back on python that
it's not fast

7346
01:57:04,390 --> 01:57:04,400
it's not fast
 

7347
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:05,990
it's not fast
you know you see c if you want to write

7348
01:57:05,990 --> 01:57:06,000
you know you see c if you want to write
 

7349
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,149
you know you see c if you want to write
something that's fast you use cc plus if

7350
01:57:08,149 --> 01:57:08,159
something that's fast you use cc plus if
 

7351
01:57:08,159 --> 01:57:10,070
something that's fast you use cc plus if
you want to write something that's

7352
01:57:10,070 --> 01:57:10,080
you want to write something that's
 

7353
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:12,149
you want to write something that's
usable and friendly but slow you use

7354
01:57:12,149 --> 01:57:12,159
usable and friendly but slow you use
 

7355
01:57:12,159 --> 01:57:13,189
usable and friendly but slow you use
python

7356
01:57:13,189 --> 01:57:13,199
python
 

7357
01:57:13,199 --> 01:57:14,470
python
and so

7358
01:57:14,470 --> 01:57:14,480
and so
 

7359
01:57:14,480 --> 01:57:16,790
and so
what is uh number what is its goal how

7360
01:57:16,790 --> 01:57:16,800
what is uh number what is its goal how
 

7361
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:18,629
what is uh number what is its goal how
does it work great yeah yes that's what

7362
01:57:18,629 --> 01:57:18,639
does it work great yeah yes that's what
 

7363
01:57:18,639 --> 01:57:20,629
does it work great yeah yes that's what
the argument and the reality was people

7364
01:57:20,629 --> 01:57:20,639
the argument and the reality was people
 

7365
01:57:20,639 --> 01:57:21,510
the argument and the reality was people
would write

7366
01:57:21,510 --> 01:57:21,520
would write
 

7367
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:23,270
would write
high-level code and use compiled code

7368
01:57:23,270 --> 01:57:23,280
high-level code and use compiled code
 

7369
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:25,109
high-level code and use compiled code
but there's still user story use cases

7370
01:57:25,109 --> 01:57:25,119
but there's still user story use cases
 

7371
01:57:25,119 --> 01:57:26,470
but there's still user story use cases
where you want to

7372
01:57:26,470 --> 01:57:26,480
where you want to
 

7373
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:28,390
where you want to
write python but then have it still be

7374
01:57:28,390 --> 01:57:28,400
write python but then have it still be
 

7375
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:30,550
write python but then have it still be
fast you still need to write a for loop

7376
01:57:30,550 --> 01:57:30,560
fast you still need to write a for loop
 

7377
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:32,790
fast you still need to write a for loop
like before number it was always don't

7378
01:57:32,790 --> 01:57:32,800
like before number it was always don't
 

7379
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:34,550
like before number it was always don't
write a for loop you know write it in a

7380
01:57:34,550 --> 01:57:34,560
write a for loop you know write it in a
 

7381
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:37,109
write a for loop you know write it in a
vectorized way you put in an array

7382
01:57:37,109 --> 01:57:37,119
vectorized way you put in an array
 

7383
01:57:37,119 --> 01:57:39,030
vectorized way you put in an array
and often that'll that can make a memory

7384
01:57:39,030 --> 01:57:39,040
and often that'll that can make a memory
 

7385
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:40,870
and often that'll that can make a memory
trade off like quite often you can do it

7386
01:57:40,870 --> 01:57:40,880
trade off like quite often you can do it
 

7387
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:42,550
trade off like quite often you can do it
but then you make maybe use more memory

7388
01:57:42,550 --> 01:57:42,560
but then you make maybe use more memory
 

7389
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:44,470
but then you make maybe use more memory
because you have to build this array of

7390
01:57:44,470 --> 01:57:44,480
because you have to build this array of
 

7391
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:45,750
because you have to build this array of
data that you don't necessarily need all

7392
01:57:45,750 --> 01:57:45,760
data that you don't necessarily need all
 

7393
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:46,629
data that you don't necessarily need all
the time

7394
01:57:46,629 --> 01:57:46,639
the time
 

7395
01:57:46,639 --> 01:57:47,510
the time
so

7396
01:57:47,510 --> 01:57:47,520
so
 

7397
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:49,510
so
number was it started from a desire to

7398
01:57:49,510 --> 01:57:49,520
number was it started from a desire to
 

7399
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:50,310
number was it started from a desire to
have

7400
01:57:50,310 --> 01:57:50,320
have
 

7401
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:52,709
have
a kind of a vectorized that worked

7402
01:57:52,709 --> 01:57:52,719
a kind of a vectorized that worked
 

7403
01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:55,270
a kind of a vectorized that worked
vectorized was a was a tool in numpy it

7404
01:57:55,270 --> 01:57:55,280
vectorized was a was a tool in numpy it
 

7405
01:57:55,280 --> 01:57:56,950
vectorized was a was a tool in numpy it
was released you give it a python

7406
01:57:56,950 --> 01:57:56,960
was released you give it a python
 

7407
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:58,870
was released you give it a python
function and it gave you a universal

7408
01:57:58,870 --> 01:57:58,880
function and it gave you a universal
 

7409
01:57:58,880 --> 01:58:00,470
function and it gave you a universal
function a u-function would work on

7410
01:58:00,470 --> 01:58:00,480
function a u-function would work on
 

7411
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:02,149
function a u-function would work on
arrays so get the function that just

7412
01:58:02,149 --> 01:58:02,159
arrays so get the function that just
 

7413
01:58:02,159 --> 01:58:04,629
arrays so get the function that just
worked on a scalar like you could make a

7414
01:58:04,629 --> 01:58:04,639
worked on a scalar like you could make a
 

7415
01:58:04,639 --> 01:58:06,229
worked on a scalar like you could make a
like the classic case was a simple

7416
01:58:06,229 --> 01:58:06,239
like the classic case was a simple
 

7417
01:58:06,239 --> 01:58:08,870
like the classic case was a simple
function and if then statement in it so

7418
01:58:08,870 --> 01:58:08,880
function and if then statement in it so
 

7419
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:11,990
function and if then statement in it so
uh sine x over x function sync function

7420
01:58:11,990 --> 01:58:12,000
uh sine x over x function sync function
 

7421
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:13,910
uh sine x over x function sync function
if x equals zero return one otherwise do

7422
01:58:13,910 --> 01:58:13,920
if x equals zero return one otherwise do
 

7423
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:15,910
if x equals zero return one otherwise do
sine x over x

7424
01:58:15,910 --> 01:58:15,920
sine x over x
 

7425
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:17,350
sine x over x
the challenge is you don't want that

7426
01:58:17,350 --> 01:58:17,360
the challenge is you don't want that
 

7427
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:18,950
the challenge is you don't want that
loop had one in python so you want a

7428
01:58:18,950 --> 01:58:18,960
loop had one in python so you want a
 

7429
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:20,709
loop had one in python so you want a
compiled version of that

7430
01:58:20,709 --> 01:58:20,719
compiled version of that
 

7431
01:58:20,719 --> 01:58:23,030
compiled version of that
um but the ufo the vectorize and numpy

7432
01:58:23,030 --> 01:58:23,040
um but the ufo the vectorize and numpy
 

7433
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:24,790
um but the ufo the vectorize and numpy
would just give you a python function so

7434
01:58:24,790 --> 01:58:24,800
would just give you a python function so
 

7435
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:26,870
would just give you a python function so
it would take the array of numbers and

7436
01:58:26,870 --> 01:58:26,880
it would take the array of numbers and
 

7437
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:29,430
it would take the array of numbers and
at every call do a loop back into python

7438
01:58:29,430 --> 01:58:29,440
at every call do a loop back into python
 

7439
01:58:29,440 --> 01:58:30,709
at every call do a loop back into python
so it was very slow it gave me the

7440
01:58:30,709 --> 01:58:30,719
so it was very slow it gave me the
 

7441
01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:32,070
so it was very slow it gave me the
appearance of a u func but it was very

7442
01:58:32,070 --> 01:58:32,080
appearance of a u func but it was very
 

7443
01:58:32,080 --> 01:58:34,550
appearance of a u func but it was very
slow so i always wanted a vectorize that

7444
01:58:34,550 --> 01:58:34,560
slow so i always wanted a vectorize that
 

7445
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:36,149
slow so i always wanted a vectorize that
would take that python scalar function

7446
01:58:36,149 --> 01:58:36,159
would take that python scalar function
 

7447
01:58:36,159 --> 01:58:38,310
would take that python scalar function
and produce a u-func working on binary

7448
01:58:38,310 --> 01:58:38,320
and produce a u-func working on binary
 

7449
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:41,030
and produce a u-func working on binary
native code so in fact i had somebody

7450
01:58:41,030 --> 01:58:41,040
native code so in fact i had somebody
 

7451
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:42,950
native code so in fact i had somebody
work on that with pi pi to see if

7452
01:58:42,950 --> 01:58:42,960
work on that with pi pi to see if
 

7453
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:44,390
work on that with pi pi to see if
pipette could be used to produce a u

7454
01:58:44,390 --> 01:58:44,400
pipette could be used to produce a u
 

7455
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:48,229
pipette could be used to produce a u
func like that early on um in 2009 or

7456
01:58:48,229 --> 01:58:48,239
func like that early on um in 2009 or
 

7457
01:58:48,239 --> 01:58:50,709
func like that early on um in 2009 or
something like that 2010. um they didn't

7458
01:58:50,709 --> 01:58:50,719
something like that 2010. um they didn't
 

7459
01:58:50,719 --> 01:58:51,990
something like that 2010. um they didn't
work that well it was kind of pretty

7460
01:58:51,990 --> 01:58:52,000
work that well it was kind of pretty
 

7461
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,310
work that well it was kind of pretty
bulky but in 2012

7462
01:58:54,310 --> 01:58:54,320
bulky but in 2012
 

7463
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:57,030
bulky but in 2012
uh peter and i just started anaconda we

7464
01:58:57,030 --> 01:58:57,040
uh peter and i just started anaconda we
 

7465
01:58:57,040 --> 01:58:58,790
uh peter and i just started anaconda we
had i just i

7466
01:58:58,790 --> 01:58:58,800
had i just i
 

7467
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:00,550
had i just i
i'd learned to raise money

7468
01:59:00,550 --> 01:59:00,560
i'd learned to raise money
 

7469
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:02,149
i'd learned to raise money
that's a different topic but i've

7470
01:59:02,149 --> 01:59:02,159
that's a different topic but i've
 

7471
01:59:02,159 --> 01:59:03,830
that's a different topic but i've
learned to you know raise money from

friends family and fools as they say and

7474
01:59:06,870 --> 01:59:06,880
friends family and fools as they say and
 

7475
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:09,589
friends family and fools as they say and
that's a good line

7476
01:59:09,589 --> 01:59:09,599

 

7477
01:59:09,599 --> 01:59:12,390

oh that's a good sign but you know so i

7478
01:59:12,390 --> 01:59:12,400
oh that's a good sign but you know so i
 

7479
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:13,830
oh that's a good sign but you know so i
we're trying to do something we were

7480
01:59:13,830 --> 01:59:13,840
we're trying to do something we were
 

7481
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:14,870
we're trying to do something we were
trying to change the world peter and i

7482
01:59:14,870 --> 01:59:14,880
trying to change the world peter and i

are super ambitious we wanted to make

7484
01:59:16,629 --> 01:59:16,639
are super ambitious we wanted to make
 

7485
01:59:16,639 --> 01:59:18,550
are super ambitious we wanted to make
array computing and we had ideas for

7486
01:59:18,550 --> 01:59:18,560
array computing and we had ideas for
 

7487
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:20,070
array computing and we had ideas for
really what's still still the energy

7488
01:59:20,070 --> 01:59:20,080
really what's still still the energy
 

7489
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:21,510
really what's still still the energy
right now how do you do

7490
01:59:21,510 --> 01:59:21,520
right now how do you do
 

7491
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:23,990
right now how do you do
at scale data science we had a bunch of

7492
01:59:23,990 --> 01:59:24,000
at scale data science we had a bunch of
 

7493
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,669
at scale data science we had a bunch of
ideas there but one of them

7494
01:59:25,669 --> 01:59:25,679
ideas there but one of them
 

7495
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:27,830
ideas there but one of them
i just talked to people about llvm and i

7496
01:59:27,830 --> 01:59:27,840
i just talked to people about llvm and i
 

7497
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:30,390
i just talked to people about llvm and i
was like there's a way to do this i just

7498
01:59:30,390 --> 01:59:30,400
was like there's a way to do this i just
 

7499
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:32,149
was like there's a way to do this i just
i went uh i heard about my friend dave

7500
01:59:32,149 --> 01:59:32,159
i went uh i heard about my friend dave
 

7501
01:59:32,159 --> 01:59:34,070
i went uh i heard about my friend dave
beasley at a compiler course so i was

7502
01:59:34,070 --> 01:59:34,080
beasley at a compiler course so i was
 

7503
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:36,070
beasley at a compiler course so i was
looking at compilers like and i realized

7504
01:59:36,070 --> 01:59:36,080
looking at compilers like and i realized
 

7505
01:59:36,080 --> 01:59:38,149
looking at compilers like and i realized
oh this is what you do and so i wrote a

7506
01:59:38,149 --> 01:59:38,159
oh this is what you do and so i wrote a
 

7507
01:59:38,159 --> 01:59:39,270
oh this is what you do and so i wrote a
version

7508
01:59:39,270 --> 01:59:39,280
version
 

7509
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:41,430
version
of number that just basically

7510
01:59:41,430 --> 01:59:41,440
of number that just basically
 

7511
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:42,390
of number that just basically
mapped

7512
01:59:42,390 --> 01:59:42,400
mapped
 

7513
01:59:42,400 --> 01:59:45,510
mapped
python byte code to lvm

7514
01:59:45,510 --> 01:59:45,520
python byte code to lvm
 

7515
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:47,270
python byte code to lvm
nice right so

7516
01:59:47,270 --> 01:59:47,280
nice right so
 

7517
01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:49,030
nice right so
and the first version is like this works

7518
01:59:49,030 --> 01:59:49,040
and the first version is like this works
 

7519
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:50,950
and the first version is like this works
and it produces code that's fast this is

7520
01:59:50,950 --> 01:59:50,960
and it produces code that's fast this is
 

7521
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:52,470
and it produces code that's fast this is
cool for you know obviously a reduced

7522
01:59:52,470 --> 01:59:52,480
cool for you know obviously a reduced
 

7523
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:53,910
cool for you know obviously a reduced
subset of python i didn't support all

7524
01:59:53,910 --> 01:59:53,920
subset of python i didn't support all
 

7525
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:55,669
subset of python i didn't support all
the python language there had been

7526
01:59:55,669 --> 01:59:55,679
the python language there had been
 

7527
01:59:55,679 --> 01:59:57,350
the python language there had been
efforts to speed up python in the past

7528
01:59:57,350 --> 01:59:57,360
efforts to speed up python in the past
 

7529
01:59:57,360 --> 01:59:59,350
efforts to speed up python in the past
but those efforts were i would say not

7530
01:59:59,350 --> 01:59:59,360
but those efforts were i would say not
 

7531
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:00,790
but those efforts were i would say not
from the array computing perspective not

7532
02:00:00,790 --> 02:00:00,800
from the array computing perspective not
 

7533
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:01,750
from the array computing perspective not
from the perspective of wanting to

7534
02:00:01,750 --> 02:00:01,760
from the perspective of wanting to
 

7535
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:03,510
from the perspective of wanting to
produce a vectorized improvement they

7536
02:00:03,510 --> 02:00:03,520
produce a vectorized improvement they
 

7537
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:05,109
produce a vectorized improvement they
were from perspective of speeding up the

7538
02:00:05,109 --> 02:00:05,119
were from perspective of speeding up the
 

7539
02:00:05,119 --> 02:00:07,030
were from perspective of speeding up the
runtime of python which is fundamentally

7540
02:00:07,030 --> 02:00:07,040
runtime of python which is fundamentally
 

7541
02:00:07,040 --> 02:00:09,830
runtime of python which is fundamentally
hard because python allows for some

7542
02:00:09,830 --> 02:00:09,840
hard because python allows for some
 

7543
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:11,669
hard because python allows for some
constructs that aren't you can't speed

7544
02:00:11,669 --> 02:00:11,679
constructs that aren't you can't speed
 

7545
02:00:11,679 --> 02:00:14,229
constructs that aren't you can't speed
up like it's this generic you know what

7546
02:00:14,229 --> 02:00:14,239
up like it's this generic you know what
 

7547
02:00:14,239 --> 02:00:16,709
up like it's this generic you know what
is this variable so i from the start did

7548
02:00:16,709 --> 02:00:16,719
is this variable so i from the start did
 

7549
02:00:16,719 --> 02:00:19,510
is this variable so i from the start did
not try to replicate python's semantics

7550
02:00:19,510 --> 02:00:19,520
not try to replicate python's semantics
 

7551
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:21,030
not try to replicate python's semantics
entirely i said i'm going to take a

7552
02:00:21,030 --> 02:00:21,040
entirely i said i'm going to take a
 

7553
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:23,270
entirely i said i'm going to take a
subset of the python syntax and let

7554
02:00:23,270 --> 02:00:23,280
subset of the python syntax and let
 

7555
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:25,589
subset of the python syntax and let
people write syntax in python but it's

7556
02:00:25,589 --> 02:00:25,599
people write syntax in python but it's
 

7557
02:00:25,599 --> 02:00:27,510
people write syntax in python but it's
kind of a new language really so it's

7558
02:00:27,510 --> 02:00:27,520
kind of a new language really so it's
 

7559
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:30,070
kind of a new language really so it's
almost like for loops like focusing on

7560
02:00:30,070 --> 02:00:30,080
almost like for loops like focusing on
 

7561
02:00:30,080 --> 02:00:33,109
almost like for loops like focusing on
for loops scalar arithmetic

7562
02:00:33,109 --> 02:00:33,119
for loops scalar arithmetic
 

7563
02:00:33,119 --> 02:00:35,189
for loops scalar arithmetic
you know typed you know really typed

7564
02:00:35,189 --> 02:00:35,199
you know typed you know really typed
 

7565
02:00:35,199 --> 02:00:36,070
you know typed you know really typed
language

7566
02:00:36,070 --> 02:00:36,080
language
 

7567
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:38,070
language
a type subset

7568
02:00:38,070 --> 02:00:38,080
a type subset
 

7569
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:40,390
a type subset
that was the key so but we wanted to

7570
02:00:40,390 --> 02:00:40,400
that was the key so but we wanted to
 

7571
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:42,070
that was the key so but we wanted to
add inference of types so you didn't

7572
02:00:42,070 --> 02:00:42,080
add inference of types so you didn't
 

7573
02:00:42,080 --> 02:00:43,510
add inference of types so you didn't
have to spell all the types out because

7574
02:00:43,510 --> 02:00:43,520
have to spell all the types out because
 

7575
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:45,669
have to spell all the types out because
when you call a function

7576
02:00:45,669 --> 02:00:45,679
when you call a function
 

7577
02:00:45,679 --> 02:00:47,669
when you call a function
so python is typed it's just dynamically

7578
02:00:47,669 --> 02:00:47,679
so python is typed it's just dynamically
 

7579
02:00:47,679 --> 02:00:48,790
so python is typed it's just dynamically
typed so you don't tell it what the

7580
02:00:48,790 --> 02:00:48,800
typed so you don't tell it what the
 

7581
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:51,030
typed so you don't tell it what the
types are but when it runs every time an

7582
02:00:51,030 --> 02:00:51,040
types are but when it runs every time an
 

7583
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:52,709
types are but when it runs every time an
object runs there's a type for the

7584
02:00:52,709 --> 02:00:52,719
object runs there's a type for the
 

7585
02:00:52,719 --> 02:00:54,470
object runs there's a type for the
variables you know what it is

7586
02:00:54,470 --> 02:00:54,480
variables you know what it is
 

7587
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:56,229
variables you know what it is
and so that was the design goals of

7588
02:00:56,229 --> 02:00:56,239
and so that was the design goals of
 

7589
02:00:56,239 --> 02:00:58,550
and so that was the design goals of
number were to make it possible to write

7590
02:00:58,550 --> 02:00:58,560
number were to make it possible to write
 

7591
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:00,470
number were to make it possible to write
functions that could be compiled

7592
02:01:00,470 --> 02:01:00,480
functions that could be compiled
 

7593
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:03,270
functions that could be compiled
and and have them use for numpy arrays

7594
02:01:03,270 --> 02:01:03,280
and and have them use for numpy arrays
 

7595
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:05,510
and and have them use for numpy arrays
like the needed support numpy race and

7596
02:01:05,510 --> 02:01:05,520
like the needed support numpy race and
 

7597
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:07,510
like the needed support numpy race and
so uh how does it work you have a

7598
02:01:07,510 --> 02:01:07,520
so uh how does it work you have a
 

7599
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:10,070
so uh how does it work you have a
comment within python that tells to do

7600
02:01:10,070 --> 02:01:10,080
comment within python that tells to do
 

7601
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:12,070
comment within python that tells to do
like how do you help out compiler yeah

7602
02:01:12,070 --> 02:01:12,080
like how do you help out compiler yeah
 

7603
02:01:12,080 --> 02:01:14,070
like how do you help out compiler yeah
so

7604
02:01:14,070 --> 02:01:14,080
so
 

7605
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:16,310
so
there isn't much actually you don't it's

7606
02:01:16,310 --> 02:01:16,320
there isn't much actually you don't it's
 

7607
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:17,830
there isn't much actually you don't it's
kind of magical in the sense that just

7608
02:01:17,830 --> 02:01:17,840
kind of magical in the sense that just
 

7609
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:19,510
kind of magical in the sense that just
looks at the type of the objects and

7610
02:01:19,510 --> 02:01:19,520
looks at the type of the objects and
 

7611
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:21,189
looks at the type of the objects and
then does type inference to determine

7612
02:01:21,189 --> 02:01:21,199
then does type inference to determine
 

7613
02:01:21,199 --> 02:01:23,669
then does type inference to determine
any other variables it needs and then it

7614
02:01:23,669 --> 02:01:23,679
any other variables it needs and then it
 

7615
02:01:23,679 --> 02:01:26,709
any other variables it needs and then it
was also because we had a use case that

7616
02:01:26,709 --> 02:01:26,719
was also because we had a use case that
 

7617
02:01:26,719 --> 02:01:28,550
was also because we had a use case that
that could work early like one of the

7618
02:01:28,550 --> 02:01:28,560
that could work early like one of the
 

7619
02:01:28,560 --> 02:01:30,070
that could work early like one of the
challenges of any kind of new new

7620
02:01:30,070 --> 02:01:30,080
challenges of any kind of new new
 

7621
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:31,350
challenges of any kind of new new
development is if you have something

7622
02:01:31,350 --> 02:01:31,360
development is if you have something
 

7623
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:32,870
development is if you have something
that to make it work it's going to take

7624
02:01:32,870 --> 02:01:32,880
that to make it work it's going to take
 

7625
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:34,870
that to make it work it's going to take
you a long time it's really hard to get

7626
02:01:34,870 --> 02:01:34,880
you a long time it's really hard to get
 

7627
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:36,709
you a long time it's really hard to get
out of the ground if you have a project

7628
02:01:36,709 --> 02:01:36,719
out of the ground if you have a project
 

7629
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:39,189
out of the ground if you have a project
where there's some incremental story it

7630
02:01:39,189 --> 02:01:39,199
where there's some incremental story it
 

7631
02:01:39,199 --> 02:01:41,270
where there's some incremental story it
can start working today and solve a

7632
02:01:41,270 --> 02:01:41,280
can start working today and solve a
 

7633
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:43,109
can start working today and solve a
problem then you can start getting it

7634
02:01:43,109 --> 02:01:43,119
problem then you can start getting it
 

7635
02:01:43,119 --> 02:01:44,870
problem then you can start getting it
out there getting feedback because

7636
02:01:44,870 --> 02:01:44,880
out there getting feedback because
 

7637
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:46,629
out there getting feedback because
number today you know numbers nine years

7638
02:01:46,629 --> 02:01:46,639
number today you know numbers nine years
 

7639
02:01:46,639 --> 02:01:49,030
number today you know numbers nine years
old today right the first

7640
02:01:49,030 --> 02:01:49,040
old today right the first
 

7641
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:51,910
old today right the first
two three versions were not great right

7642
02:01:51,910 --> 02:01:51,920
two three versions were not great right
 

7643
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:53,270
two three versions were not great right
but they solved a problem and some

7644
02:01:53,270 --> 02:01:53,280
but they solved a problem and some
 

7645
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:54,470
but they solved a problem and some
people could try it we could get some

7646
02:01:54,470 --> 02:01:54,480
people could try it we could get some
 

7647
02:01:54,480 --> 02:01:56,629
people could try it we could get some
feedback on it not great and that it was

7648
02:01:56,629 --> 02:01:56,639
feedback on it not great and that it was
 

7649
02:01:56,639 --> 02:01:58,950
feedback on it not great and that it was
very focused very very fragile very

7650
02:01:58,950 --> 02:01:58,960
very focused very very fragile very
 

7651
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:00,390
very focused very very fragile very
substantive

7652
02:02:00,390 --> 02:02:00,400
substantive
 

7653
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:02,070
substantive
the subset it would actually compile was

7654
02:02:02,070 --> 02:02:02,080
the subset it would actually compile was
 

7655
02:02:02,080 --> 02:02:04,149
the subset it would actually compile was
small and so if you wrote python code

7656
02:02:04,149 --> 02:02:04,159
small and so if you wrote python code
 

7657
02:02:04,159 --> 02:02:05,990
small and so if you wrote python code
and said to the way it worked did you

7658
02:02:05,990 --> 02:02:06,000
and said to the way it worked did you
 

7659
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,310
and said to the way it worked did you
write a function and you say at jit use

7660
02:02:08,310 --> 02:02:08,320
write a function and you say at jit use
 

7661
02:02:08,320 --> 02:02:09,830
write a function and you say at jit use
decorators so decorators just these

7662
02:02:09,830 --> 02:02:09,840
decorators so decorators just these
 

7663
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:12,070
decorators so decorators just these
little constructs let you

7664
02:02:12,070 --> 02:02:12,080
little constructs let you
 

7665
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:13,830
little constructs let you
decorate code with an app and then a

7666
02:02:13,830 --> 02:02:13,840
decorate code with an app and then a
 

7667
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:14,870
decorate code with an app and then a
name

7668
02:02:14,870 --> 02:02:14,880
name
 

7669
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:16,709
name
the atgit would take your python

7670
02:02:16,709 --> 02:02:16,719
the atgit would take your python
 

7671
02:02:16,719 --> 02:02:18,709
the atgit would take your python
function and actually just compile it

7672
02:02:18,709 --> 02:02:18,719
function and actually just compile it
 

7673
02:02:18,719 --> 02:02:21,750
function and actually just compile it
and replace the python function with a

7674
02:02:21,750 --> 02:02:21,760
and replace the python function with a
 

7675
02:02:21,760 --> 02:02:23,109
and replace the python function with a
another function that interacts with

7676
02:02:23,109 --> 02:02:23,119
another function that interacts with
 

7677
02:02:23,119 --> 02:02:24,870
another function that interacts with
this compiled function got it and it

7678
02:02:24,870 --> 02:02:24,880
this compiled function got it and it
 

7679
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:26,390
this compiled function got it and it
would just do that and

7680
02:02:26,390 --> 02:02:26,400
would just do that and
 

7681
02:02:26,400 --> 02:02:27,830
would just do that and
it would you know we went from python

7682
02:02:27,830 --> 02:02:27,840
it would you know we went from python
 

7683
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:29,669
it would you know we went from python
bytecode then we went to ast i mean

7684
02:02:29,669 --> 02:02:29,679
bytecode then we went to ast i mean
 

7685
02:02:29,679 --> 02:02:31,510
bytecode then we went to ast i mean
writing compiler is actually i learned a

7686
02:02:31,510 --> 02:02:31,520
writing compiler is actually i learned a
 

7687
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:33,109
writing compiler is actually i learned a
lot about why computer science is taught

7688
02:02:33,109 --> 02:02:33,119
lot about why computer science is taught
 

7689
02:02:33,119 --> 02:02:34,709
lot about why computer science is taught
the way it is because

7690
02:02:34,709 --> 02:02:34,719
the way it is because
 

7691
02:02:34,719 --> 02:02:36,470
the way it is because
compilers can be hard to write there's

7692
02:02:36,470 --> 02:02:36,480
compilers can be hard to write there's
 

7693
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:37,910
compilers can be hard to write there's
they use tree structures they use all

7694
02:02:37,910 --> 02:02:37,920
they use tree structures they use all
 

7695
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:39,750
they use tree structures they use all
the concepts of computer science that

7696
02:02:39,750 --> 02:02:39,760
the concepts of computer science that
 

7697
02:02:39,760 --> 02:02:41,990
the concepts of computer science that
are needed and it's actually hard to to

7698
02:02:41,990 --> 02:02:42,000
are needed and it's actually hard to to
 

7699
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:43,669
are needed and it's actually hard to to
you can it's easy to

7700
02:02:43,669 --> 02:02:43,679
you can it's easy to
 

7701
02:02:43,679 --> 02:02:44,870
you can it's easy to
to write a compiler and have it be

7702
02:02:44,870 --> 02:02:44,880
to write a compiler and have it be
 

7703
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:47,030
to write a compiler and have it be
spaghetti code like the passes become

7704
02:02:47,030 --> 02:02:47,040
spaghetti code like the passes become
 

7705
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:48,390
spaghetti code like the passes become
challenging and we ended up with three

7706
02:02:48,390 --> 02:02:48,400
challenging and we ended up with three
 

7707
02:02:48,400 --> 02:02:50,149
challenging and we ended up with three
versions of number right number got

7708
02:02:50,149 --> 02:02:50,159
versions of number right number got
 

7709
02:02:50,159 --> 02:02:51,430
versions of number right number got
written three times

7710
02:02:51,430 --> 02:02:51,440
written three times
 

7711
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:53,430
written three times
what's uh

7712
02:02:53,430 --> 02:02:53,440
what's uh
 

7713
02:02:53,440 --> 02:02:54,790
what's uh
what programming language is number

7714
02:02:54,790 --> 02:02:54,800
what programming language is number
 

7715
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:57,030
what programming language is number
written in python

7716
02:02:57,030 --> 02:02:57,040
written in python
 

7717
02:02:57,040 --> 02:02:58,830
written in python
okay yeah python

7718
02:02:58,830 --> 02:02:58,840
okay yeah python
 

7719
02:02:58,840 --> 02:03:01,589
okay yeah python
so really yeah it's fascinating yeah so

7720
02:03:01,589 --> 02:03:01,599
so really yeah it's fascinating yeah so
 

7721
02:03:01,599 --> 02:03:03,430
so really yeah it's fascinating yeah so
python but then the whole goal of number

7722
02:03:03,430 --> 02:03:03,440
python but then the whole goal of number
 

7723
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:05,669
python but then the whole goal of number
is to translate python byte code

7724
02:03:05,669 --> 02:03:05,679
is to translate python byte code
 

7725
02:03:05,679 --> 02:03:08,550
is to translate python byte code
to llvm and so lvm actually does the

7726
02:03:08,550 --> 02:03:08,560
to llvm and so lvm actually does the
 

7727
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:09,990
to llvm and so lvm actually does the
code generation in fact a lot of times

7728
02:03:09,990 --> 02:03:10,000
code generation in fact a lot of times
 

7729
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:11,669
code generation in fact a lot of times
they'd say yeah it's super easy to write

7730
02:03:11,669 --> 02:03:11,679
they'd say yeah it's super easy to write
 

7731
02:03:11,679 --> 02:03:13,430
they'd say yeah it's super easy to write
a compiler if you're not writing the

7732
02:03:13,430 --> 02:03:13,440
a compiler if you're not writing the
 

7733
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:16,470
a compiler if you're not writing the
parser nor the code generator right so

7734
02:03:16,470 --> 02:03:16,480
parser nor the code generator right so
 

7735
02:03:16,480 --> 02:03:18,550
parser nor the code generator right so
for people who don't know llvm is the

7736
02:03:18,550 --> 02:03:18,560
for people who don't know llvm is the
 

7737
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:20,310
for people who don't know llvm is the
compiler itself so you're compatible

7738
02:03:20,310 --> 02:03:20,320
compiler itself so you're compatible
 

7739
02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:21,830
compiler itself so you're compatible
yeah it's really badly named low level

7740
02:03:21,830 --> 02:03:21,840
yeah it's really badly named low level
 

7741
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:23,669
yeah it's really badly named low level
virtual machine which that part of it is

7742
02:03:23,669 --> 02:03:23,679
virtual machine which that part of it is
 

7743
02:03:23,679 --> 02:03:25,589
virtual machine which that part of it is
not used it's really low doesn't mean

7744
02:03:25,589 --> 02:03:25,599
not used it's really low doesn't mean
 

7745
02:03:25,599 --> 02:03:28,070
not used it's really low doesn't mean
that

7746
02:03:28,070 --> 02:03:28,080
that
 

7747
02:03:28,080 --> 02:03:30,709
that
love chris but the name makes you imply

7748
02:03:30,709 --> 02:03:30,719
love chris but the name makes you imply
 

7749
02:03:30,719 --> 02:03:31,830
love chris but the name makes you imply
that the virtual machine is what it's

7750
02:03:31,830 --> 02:03:31,840
that the virtual machine is what it's
 

7751
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:33,589
that the virtual machine is what it's
all about it's actually the ir and the

7752
02:03:33,589 --> 02:03:33,599
all about it's actually the ir and the
 

7753
02:03:33,599 --> 02:03:36,070
all about it's actually the ir and the
library the the code generation that's

7754
02:03:36,070 --> 02:03:36,080
library the the code generation that's
 

7755
02:03:36,080 --> 02:03:38,310
library the the code generation that's
the real beauty of it the fact that what

7756
02:03:38,310 --> 02:03:38,320
the real beauty of it the fact that what
 

7757
02:03:38,320 --> 02:03:39,830
the real beauty of it the fact that what
i love about llvm was the fact that it

7758
02:03:39,830 --> 02:03:39,840
i love about llvm was the fact that it
 

7759
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:43,109
i love about llvm was the fact that it
was a plateau you could collaborate on

7760
02:03:43,109 --> 02:03:43,119
was a plateau you could collaborate on
 

7761
02:03:43,119 --> 02:03:45,910
was a plateau you could collaborate on
right instead of the internals of gcc or

7762
02:03:45,910 --> 02:03:45,920
right instead of the internals of gcc or
 

7763
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:47,430
right instead of the internals of gcc or
the internals of the intel compiler like

7764
02:03:47,430 --> 02:03:47,440
the internals of the intel compiler like
 

7765
02:03:47,440 --> 02:03:48,950
the internals of the intel compiler like
how do i extend that

7766
02:03:48,950 --> 02:03:48,960
how do i extend that
 

7767
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:50,870
how do i extend that
and it was a place we could collaborate

7768
02:03:50,870 --> 02:03:50,880
and it was a place we could collaborate
 

7769
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:51,589
and it was a place we could collaborate
and

7770
02:03:51,589 --> 02:03:51,599
and
 

7771
02:03:51,599 --> 02:03:53,030
and
we were early i mean people had started

7772
02:03:53,030 --> 02:03:53,040
we were early i mean people had started
 

7773
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:55,589
we were early i mean people had started
before it's a slow compiler like it's

7774
02:03:55,589 --> 02:03:55,599
before it's a slow compiler like it's
 

7775
02:03:55,599 --> 02:03:57,510
before it's a slow compiler like it's
not a fast compiler so

7776
02:03:57,510 --> 02:03:57,520
not a fast compiler so
 

7777
02:03:57,520 --> 02:03:58,629
not a fast compiler so
for

7778
02:03:58,629 --> 02:03:58,639
for
 

7779
02:03:58,639 --> 02:04:00,390
for
some kind of jits like jits are common

7780
02:04:00,390 --> 02:04:00,400
some kind of jits like jits are common
 

7781
02:04:00,400 --> 02:04:03,270
some kind of jits like jits are common
in language because one uh every browser

7782
02:04:03,270 --> 02:04:03,280
in language because one uh every browser
 

7783
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:05,830
in language because one uh every browser
has a javascript jet it does real-time

7784
02:04:05,830 --> 02:04:05,840
has a javascript jet it does real-time
 

7785
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:07,750
has a javascript jet it does real-time
compilation of the javascript to machine

7786
02:04:07,750 --> 02:04:07,760
compilation of the javascript to machine
 

7787
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:08,950
compilation of the javascript to machine
code

7788
02:04:08,950 --> 02:04:08,960
code
 

7789
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:10,629
code
for people who don't know jet is just in

7790
02:04:10,629 --> 02:04:10,639
for people who don't know jet is just in
 

7791
02:04:10,639 --> 02:04:12,069
for people who don't know jet is just in
time compilation thank you yeah just in

7792
02:04:12,069 --> 02:04:12,079
time compilation thank you yeah just in
 

7793
02:04:12,079 --> 02:04:13,750
time compilation thank you yeah just in
time compilation they're actually really

7794
02:04:13,750 --> 02:04:13,760
time compilation they're actually really
 

7795
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:16,310
time compilation they're actually really
sophisticated in fact i got jealous of

7796
02:04:16,310 --> 02:04:16,320
sophisticated in fact i got jealous of
 

7797
02:04:16,320 --> 02:04:17,510
sophisticated in fact i got jealous of
how much effort was put into the

7798
02:04:17,510 --> 02:04:17,520
how much effort was put into the
 

7799
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:19,510
how much effort was put into the
javascript jets yes well it's kind of

7800
02:04:19,510 --> 02:04:19,520
javascript jets yes well it's kind of
 

7801
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:21,030
javascript jets yes well it's kind of
incredible what they've done yes that

7802
02:04:21,030 --> 02:04:21,040
incredible what they've done yes that
 

7803
02:04:21,040 --> 02:04:21,910
incredible what they've done yes that
was good

7804
02:04:21,910 --> 02:04:21,920
was good
 

7805
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:24,550
was good
i completely agree i'm very impressed um

7806
02:04:24,550 --> 02:04:24,560
i completely agree i'm very impressed um
 

7807
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:26,229
i completely agree i'm very impressed um
but you know number wasn't it was it was

7808
02:04:26,229 --> 02:04:26,239
but you know number wasn't it was it was
 

7809
02:04:26,239 --> 02:04:28,229
but you know number wasn't it was it was
an effort to make that happen with

7810
02:04:28,229 --> 02:04:28,239
an effort to make that happen with
 

7811
02:04:28,239 --> 02:04:30,790
an effort to make that happen with
python and so we used some of the money

7812
02:04:30,790 --> 02:04:30,800
python and so we used some of the money
 

7813
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:32,870
python and so we used some of the money
raised for anaconda to do it and then we

7814
02:04:32,870 --> 02:04:32,880
raised for anaconda to do it and then we
 

7815
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:34,709
raised for anaconda to do it and then we
also applied for this darpa grant and

7816
02:04:34,709 --> 02:04:34,719
also applied for this darpa grant and
 

7817
02:04:34,719 --> 02:04:36,149
also applied for this darpa grant and
used some of that money to continue the

7818
02:04:36,149 --> 02:04:36,159
used some of that money to continue the
 

7819
02:04:36,159 --> 02:04:38,550
used some of that money to continue the
development and then we used proceeds

7820
02:04:38,550 --> 02:04:38,560
development and then we used proceeds
 

7821
02:04:38,560 --> 02:04:40,629
development and then we used proceeds
from service pro projects we would do we

7822
02:04:40,629 --> 02:04:40,639
from service pro projects we would do we
 

7823
02:04:40,639 --> 02:04:42,629
from service pro projects we would do we
get consulting projects on

7824
02:04:42,629 --> 02:04:42,639
get consulting projects on
 

7825
02:04:42,639 --> 02:04:43,910
get consulting projects on
uh that we would then use some of the

7826
02:04:43,910 --> 02:04:43,920
uh that we would then use some of the
 

7827
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:45,669
uh that we would then use some of the
profits to invest in numbers so we ended

7828
02:04:45,669 --> 02:04:45,679
profits to invest in numbers so we ended
 

7829
02:04:45,679 --> 02:04:47,030
profits to invest in numbers so we ended
up with a team of two or three people

7830
02:04:47,030 --> 02:04:47,040
up with a team of two or three people
 

7831
02:04:47,040 --> 02:04:48,709
up with a team of two or three people
working on number

7832
02:04:48,709 --> 02:04:48,719
working on number
 

7833
02:04:48,719 --> 02:04:50,790
working on number
it was a fits and starts right and

7834
02:04:50,790 --> 02:04:50,800
it was a fits and starts right and
 

7835
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:52,550
it was a fits and starts right and
ultimately the fact that we had a

7836
02:04:52,550 --> 02:04:52,560
ultimately the fact that we had a
 

7837
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:54,229
ultimately the fact that we had a
commercial version of it also we were

7838
02:04:54,229 --> 02:04:54,239
commercial version of it also we were
 

7839
02:04:54,239 --> 02:04:55,910
commercial version of it also we were
writing so part of the way i was trying

7840
02:04:55,910 --> 02:04:55,920
writing so part of the way i was trying
 

7841
02:04:55,920 --> 02:04:57,669
writing so part of the way i was trying
to fund numbers say well let's do

7842
02:04:57,669 --> 02:04:57,679
to fund numbers say well let's do
 

7843
02:04:57,679 --> 02:04:58,790
to fund numbers say well let's do
the free number and then we'll have a

7844
02:04:58,790 --> 02:04:58,800
the free number and then we'll have a
 

7845
02:04:58,800 --> 02:04:59,910
the free number and then we'll have a
commercial version of number called

7846
02:04:59,910 --> 02:04:59,920
commercial version of number called
 

7847
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:01,750
commercial version of number called
number pro and what number pro did is it

7848
02:05:01,750 --> 02:05:01,760
number pro and what number pro did is it
 

7849
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:04,709
number pro and what number pro did is it
targeted gpus so we had the very first

7850
02:05:04,709 --> 02:05:04,719
targeted gpus so we had the very first
 

7851
02:05:04,719 --> 02:05:06,629
targeted gpus so we had the very first
cuda jit and the very first

7852
02:05:06,629 --> 02:05:06,639
cuda jit and the very first
 

7853
02:05:06,639 --> 02:05:09,589
cuda jit and the very first
jit compiler that in 2013

7854
02:05:09,589 --> 02:05:09,599
jit compiler that in 2013
 

7855
02:05:09,599 --> 02:05:13,430
jit compiler that in 2013
for 13 you could run not just a vue funk

7856
02:05:13,430 --> 02:05:13,440
for 13 you could run not just a vue funk
 

7857
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:15,830
for 13 you could run not just a vue funk
on cpu but a u function gpus and it was

7858
02:05:15,830 --> 02:05:15,840
on cpu but a u function gpus and it was
 

7859
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:17,430
on cpu but a u function gpus and it was
awesome automatically parallelize it and

7860
02:05:17,430 --> 02:05:17,440
awesome automatically parallelize it and
 

7861
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:19,510
awesome automatically parallelize it and
get 1000x speed and that's a that's an

7862
02:05:19,510 --> 02:05:19,520
get 1000x speed and that's a that's an
 

7863
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:22,950
get 1000x speed and that's a that's an
interesting funding mechanism because

7864
02:05:22,950 --> 02:05:22,960
interesting funding mechanism because
 

7865
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:25,589
interesting funding mechanism because
you know large companies

7866
02:05:25,589 --> 02:05:25,599
you know large companies
 

7867
02:05:25,599 --> 02:05:27,910
you know large companies
or larger companies care about

7868
02:05:27,910 --> 02:05:27,920
or larger companies care about
 

7869
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:30,629
or larger companies care about
speed exactly in just this way so it's

7870
02:05:30,629 --> 02:05:30,639
speed exactly in just this way so it's
 

7871
02:05:30,639 --> 02:05:33,189
speed exactly in just this way so it's
it's it's exactly a really good way yeah

7872
02:05:33,189 --> 02:05:33,199
it's it's exactly a really good way yeah
 

7873
02:05:33,199 --> 02:05:34,310
it's it's exactly a really good way yeah
there's been a couple things you know

7874
02:05:34,310 --> 02:05:34,320
there's been a couple things you know
 

7875
02:05:34,320 --> 02:05:35,750
there's been a couple things you know
people will pay for one they'll pay for

7876
02:05:35,750 --> 02:05:35,760
people will pay for one they'll pay for
 

7877
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:37,510
people will pay for one they'll pay for
really good user interfaces

7878
02:05:37,510 --> 02:05:37,520
really good user interfaces
 

7879
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:39,430
really good user interfaces
right and so and so i'm always looking

7880
02:05:39,430 --> 02:05:39,440
right and so and so i'm always looking
 

7881
02:05:39,440 --> 02:05:40,470
right and so and so i'm always looking
for what are the things people will pay

7882
02:05:40,470 --> 02:05:40,480
for what are the things people will pay
 

7883
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:41,750
for what are the things people will pay
for that you can actually adapt to the

7884
02:05:41,750 --> 02:05:41,760
for that you can actually adapt to the
 

7885
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:43,589
for that you can actually adapt to the
open source infrastructure one is

7886
02:05:43,589 --> 02:05:43,599
open source infrastructure one is
 

7887
02:05:43,599 --> 02:05:46,229
open source infrastructure one is
definitely user interfaces the second is

7888
02:05:46,229 --> 02:05:46,239
definitely user interfaces the second is
 

7889
02:05:46,239 --> 02:05:48,550
definitely user interfaces the second is
speed yeah like a better run time faster

7890
02:05:48,550 --> 02:05:48,560
speed yeah like a better run time faster
 

7891
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:49,830
speed yeah like a better run time faster
run time and then when you say people

7892
02:05:49,830 --> 02:05:49,840
run time and then when you say people
 

7893
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:51,270
run time and then when you say people
you mean like a small number of people

7894
02:05:51,270 --> 02:05:51,280
you mean like a small number of people
 

7895
02:05:51,280 --> 02:05:53,030
you mean like a small number of people
pay a lot of money but then there's also

7896
02:05:53,030 --> 02:05:53,040
pay a lot of money but then there's also
 

7897
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:55,109
pay a lot of money but then there's also
this other mechanism that that's true a

7898
02:05:55,109 --> 02:05:55,119
this other mechanism that that's true a
 

7899
02:05:55,119 --> 02:05:56,790
this other mechanism that that's true a
ton of people pay that's true a little

7900
02:05:56,790 --> 02:05:56,800
ton of people pay that's true a little
 

7901
02:05:56,800 --> 02:05:58,870
ton of people pay that's true a little
bit first i gotta

7902
02:05:58,870 --> 02:05:58,880
bit first i gotta
 

7903
02:05:58,880 --> 02:06:01,910
bit first i gotta
we mentioned anaconda we mentioned uh

7904
02:06:01,910 --> 02:06:01,920
we mentioned anaconda we mentioned uh
 

7905
02:06:01,920 --> 02:06:04,149
we mentioned anaconda we mentioned uh
friends family and fools

7906
02:06:04,149 --> 02:06:04,159
friends family and fools
 

7907
02:06:04,159 --> 02:06:07,109
friends family and fools
so uh anaconda is yet another so there's

7908
02:06:07,109 --> 02:06:07,119
so uh anaconda is yet another so there's
 

7909
02:06:07,119 --> 02:06:08,950
so uh anaconda is yet another so there's
a company but there's also a project

7910
02:06:08,950 --> 02:06:08,960
a company but there's also a project
 

7911
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:11,910
a company but there's also a project
correct that is exceptionally impactful

7912
02:06:11,910 --> 02:06:11,920
correct that is exceptionally impactful
 

7913
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:15,270
correct that is exceptionally impactful
uh in in terms of uh for many reasons

7914
02:06:15,270 --> 02:06:15,280
uh in in terms of uh for many reasons
 

7915
02:06:15,280 --> 02:06:17,430
uh in in terms of uh for many reasons
but one of which is bringing a lot more

7916
02:06:17,430 --> 02:06:17,440
but one of which is bringing a lot more
 

7917
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:19,189
but one of which is bringing a lot more
people into the

7918
02:06:19,189 --> 02:06:19,199
people into the
 

7919
02:06:19,199 --> 02:06:20,229
people into the
um

7920
02:06:20,229 --> 02:06:20,239
um
 

7921
02:06:20,239 --> 02:06:22,790
um
into the community of folks who use

7922
02:06:22,790 --> 02:06:22,800
into the community of folks who use
 

7923
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:25,350
into the community of folks who use
python so what is

7924
02:06:25,350 --> 02:06:25,360
python so what is
 

7925
02:06:25,360 --> 02:06:26,870
python so what is
anaconda

7926
02:06:26,870 --> 02:06:26,880
anaconda
 

7927
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:29,510
anaconda
what is its goals yeah maybe what is

7928
02:06:29,510 --> 02:06:29,520
what is its goals yeah maybe what is
 

7929
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:31,830
what is its goals yeah maybe what is
conda versus anaconda yeah i'll tell you

7930
02:06:31,830 --> 02:06:31,840
conda versus anaconda yeah i'll tell you
 

7931
02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:32,870
conda versus anaconda yeah i'll tell you
a little bit of the history of that

7932
02:06:32,870 --> 02:06:32,880
a little bit of the history of that
 

7933
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:35,109
a little bit of the history of that
because anaconda we we wanted to do uh

7934
02:06:35,109 --> 02:06:35,119
because anaconda we we wanted to do uh
 

7935
02:06:35,119 --> 02:06:37,830
because anaconda we we wanted to do uh
we wanted to scale python because we you

7936
02:06:37,830 --> 02:06:37,840
we wanted to scale python because we you
 

7937
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:39,109
we wanted to scale python because we you
know that was the peter and i had the

7938
02:06:39,109 --> 02:06:39,119
know that was the peter and i had the
 

7939
02:06:39,119 --> 02:06:40,709
know that was the peter and i had the
goal of when we started on anaconda we

7940
02:06:40,709 --> 02:06:40,719
goal of when we started on anaconda we
 

7941
02:06:40,719 --> 02:06:42,229
goal of when we started on anaconda we
actually started as continuum analytics

7942
02:06:42,229 --> 02:06:42,239
actually started as continuum analytics
 

7943
02:06:42,239 --> 02:06:43,750
actually started as continuum analytics
was the name of the company that started

7944
02:06:43,750 --> 02:06:43,760
was the name of the company that started
 

7945
02:06:43,760 --> 02:06:46,870
was the name of the company that started
it got renamed to anaconda in 2015.

7946
02:06:46,870 --> 02:06:46,880
it got renamed to anaconda in 2015.
 

7947
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:49,109
it got renamed to anaconda in 2015.
but we uh we said we want to scale

7948
02:06:49,109 --> 02:06:49,119
but we uh we said we want to scale
 

7949
02:06:49,119 --> 02:06:51,430
but we uh we said we want to scale
analytics numpy's great pandas is

7950
02:06:51,430 --> 02:06:51,440
analytics numpy's great pandas is
 

7951
02:06:51,440 --> 02:06:52,550
analytics numpy's great pandas is
emerging

7952
02:06:52,550 --> 02:06:52,560
emerging
 

7953
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:54,550
emerging
but these need to run at scale with lots

7954
02:06:54,550 --> 02:06:54,560
but these need to run at scale with lots
 

7955
02:06:54,560 --> 02:06:55,750
but these need to run at scale with lots
of machines the other thing we wanted to

7956
02:06:55,750 --> 02:06:55,760
of machines the other thing we wanted to
 

7957
02:06:55,760 --> 02:06:58,550
of machines the other thing we wanted to
do was make user interfaces that were

7958
02:06:58,550 --> 02:06:58,560
do was make user interfaces that were
 

7959
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:00,550
do was make user interfaces that were
web we wanted to make sure the web did

7960
02:07:00,550 --> 02:07:00,560
web we wanted to make sure the web did
 

7961
02:07:00,560 --> 02:07:02,950
web we wanted to make sure the web did
not pass by the python community that we

7962
02:07:02,950 --> 02:07:02,960
not pass by the python community that we
 

7963
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:04,629
not pass by the python community that we
had a ways to translate your data

7964
02:07:04,629 --> 02:07:04,639
had a ways to translate your data
 

7965
02:07:04,639 --> 02:07:06,550
had a ways to translate your data
science to the web so those are the two

7966
02:07:06,550 --> 02:07:06,560
science to the web so those are the two
 

7967
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:08,069
science to the web so those are the two
kind of technical areas we thought oh

7968
02:07:08,069 --> 02:07:08,079
kind of technical areas we thought oh
 

7969
02:07:08,079 --> 02:07:09,830
kind of technical areas we thought oh
we'll build products in this space and

7970
02:07:09,830 --> 02:07:09,840
we'll build products in this space and
 

7971
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:11,430
we'll build products in this space and
that was the

7972
02:07:11,430 --> 02:07:11,440
that was the
 

7973
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:12,390
that was the
idea

7974
02:07:12,390 --> 02:07:12,400
idea
 

7975
02:07:12,400 --> 02:07:13,750
idea
very quickly in but of course the thing

7976
02:07:13,750 --> 02:07:13,760
very quickly in but of course the thing
 

7977
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:15,750
very quickly in but of course the thing
i knew how to do was to do consulting to

7978
02:07:15,750 --> 02:07:15,760
i knew how to do was to do consulting to
 

7979
02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:18,149
i knew how to do was to do consulting to
make money and to make sure my family

7980
02:07:18,149 --> 02:07:18,159
make money and to make sure my family
 

7981
02:07:18,159 --> 02:07:20,229
make money and to make sure my family
and friends and fools that it invested

7982
02:07:20,229 --> 02:07:20,239
and friends and fools that it invested
 

7983
02:07:20,239 --> 02:07:22,229
and friends and fools that it invested
didn't lose their money so it's a little

7984
02:07:22,229 --> 02:07:22,239
didn't lose their money so it's a little
 

7985
02:07:22,239 --> 02:07:23,350
didn't lose their money so it's a little
different than if you take money from a

7986
02:07:23,350 --> 02:07:23,360
different than if you take money from a
 

7987
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:24,709
different than if you take money from a
venture fund if you take money from a

7988
02:07:24,709 --> 02:07:24,719
venture fund if you take money from a
 

7989
02:07:24,719 --> 02:07:26,550
venture fund if you take money from a
venture fund the venture fund they want

7990
02:07:26,550 --> 02:07:26,560
venture fund the venture fund they want
 

7991
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:27,750
venture fund the venture fund they want
you to go big or go home and they're

7992
02:07:27,750 --> 02:07:27,760
you to go big or go home and they're
 

7993
02:07:27,760 --> 02:07:29,830
you to go big or go home and they're
kind of like expecting 9 out of 10 to

7994
02:07:29,830 --> 02:07:29,840
kind of like expecting 9 out of 10 to
 

7995
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:32,950
kind of like expecting 9 out of 10 to
fail or 99 out of 100 to fail

7996
02:07:32,950 --> 02:07:32,960
fail or 99 out of 100 to fail
 

7997
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:34,550
fail or 99 out of 100 to fail
it's different i was i was out of

7998
02:07:34,550 --> 02:07:34,560
it's different i was i was out of
 

7999
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:37,030
it's different i was i was out of
barbell strategy i was like i can't fail

8000
02:07:37,030 --> 02:07:37,040
barbell strategy i was like i can't fail
 

8001
02:07:37,040 --> 02:07:38,790
barbell strategy i was like i can't fail
i mean i may not do super well but i

8002
02:07:38,790 --> 02:07:38,800
i mean i may not do super well but i
 

8003
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:40,550
i mean i may not do super well but i
cannot lose their money so i'm going to

8004
02:07:40,550 --> 02:07:40,560
cannot lose their money so i'm going to
 

8005
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:43,430
cannot lose their money so i'm going to
do something i know can return a profit

8006
02:07:43,430 --> 02:07:43,440
do something i know can return a profit
 

8007
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:46,149
do something i know can return a profit
but i want to have exposure to an upside

8008
02:07:46,149 --> 02:07:46,159
but i want to have exposure to an upside
 

8009
02:07:46,159 --> 02:07:47,910
but i want to have exposure to an upside
so that's what happened in anaconda we

8010
02:07:47,910 --> 02:07:47,920
so that's what happened in anaconda we
 

8011
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:49,589
so that's what happened in anaconda we
didn't there was lots of things we did

8012
02:07:49,589 --> 02:07:49,599
didn't there was lots of things we did
 

8013
02:07:49,599 --> 02:07:51,270
didn't there was lots of things we did
not well in terms of that structure and

8014
02:07:51,270 --> 02:07:51,280
not well in terms of that structure and
 

8015
02:07:51,280 --> 02:07:52,950
not well in terms of that structure and
i've learned from since and have it

8016
02:07:52,950 --> 02:07:52,960
i've learned from since and have it
 

8017
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:55,910
i've learned from since and have it
better but we've uh we did a really good

8018
02:07:55,910 --> 02:07:55,920
better but we've uh we did a really good
 

8019
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:58,229
better but we've uh we did a really good
job of kind of attracting the interest

8020
02:07:58,229 --> 02:07:58,239
job of kind of attracting the interest
 

8021
02:07:58,239 --> 02:07:59,830
job of kind of attracting the interest
around the area to get good people

8022
02:07:59,830 --> 02:07:59,840
around the area to get good people
 

8023
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:01,510
around the area to get good people
working and then get funneled some money

8024
02:08:01,510 --> 02:08:01,520
working and then get funneled some money
 

8025
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:03,350
working and then get funneled some money
on some interesting projects super

8026
02:08:03,350 --> 02:08:03,360
on some interesting projects super
 

8027
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:04,550
on some interesting projects super
excited about what came out of our

8028
02:08:04,550 --> 02:08:04,560
excited about what came out of our
 

8029
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:06,629
excited about what came out of our
energy there like a lot did

8030
02:08:06,629 --> 02:08:06,639
energy there like a lot did
 

8031
02:08:06,639 --> 02:08:07,589
energy there like a lot did
so what are some of the interesting

8032
02:08:07,589 --> 02:08:07,599
so what are some of the interesting
 

8033
02:08:07,599 --> 02:08:08,229
so what are some of the interesting
things

8034
02:08:08,229 --> 02:08:08,239
things
 

8035
02:08:08,239 --> 02:08:12,229
things
dask number bokeh conda uh there was a

8036
02:08:12,229 --> 02:08:12,239
dask number bokeh conda uh there was a
 

8037
02:08:12,239 --> 02:08:14,069
dask number bokeh conda uh there was a
data shader panel

8038
02:08:14,069 --> 02:08:14,079
data shader panel
 

8039
02:08:14,079 --> 02:08:15,270

um these are all tools that are

8042
02:08:17,830 --> 02:08:17,840
um these are all tools that are
 

8043
02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:19,910
um these are all tools that are
extremely relevant in terms of helping

8044
02:08:19,910 --> 02:08:19,920
extremely relevant in terms of helping
 

8045
02:08:19,920 --> 02:08:22,470
extremely relevant in terms of helping
you build applications build tools build

8046
02:08:22,470 --> 02:08:22,480
you build applications build tools build
 

8047
02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:24,470
you build applications build tools build
you know faster code

8048
02:08:24,470 --> 02:08:24,480
you know faster code
 

8049
02:08:24,480 --> 02:08:26,629
you know faster code
um there's a couple of days jupiter lab

8050
02:08:26,629 --> 02:08:26,639
um there's a couple of days jupiter lab
 

8051
02:08:26,639 --> 02:08:28,790
um there's a couple of days jupiter lab
jupiter lab came out of this too

8052
02:08:28,790 --> 02:08:28,800
jupiter lab came out of this too
 

8053
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:30,229
jupiter lab came out of this too
fascinating yeah

8054
02:08:30,229 --> 02:08:30,239
fascinating yeah
 

8055
02:08:30,239 --> 02:08:32,709
fascinating yeah
okay so uh well bokeh does plotting is

8056
02:08:32,709 --> 02:08:32,719
okay so uh well bokeh does plotting is
 

8057
02:08:32,719 --> 02:08:34,550
okay so uh well bokeh does plotting is
that okay is plotting so bokeh was one

8058
02:08:34,550 --> 02:08:34,560
that okay is plotting so bokeh was one
 

8059
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:35,910
that okay is plotting so bokeh was one
of the foundational things to say i want

8060
02:08:35,910 --> 02:08:35,920
of the foundational things to say i want
 

8061
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:37,669
of the foundational things to say i want
to do plot and python but have the

8062
02:08:37,669 --> 02:08:37,679
to do plot and python but have the
 

8063
02:08:37,679 --> 02:08:39,589
to do plot and python but have the
things show up in a web right that's

8064
02:08:39,589 --> 02:08:39,599
things show up in a web right that's
 

8065
02:08:39,599 --> 02:08:41,189
things show up in a web right that's
right that's right that's right so

8066
02:08:41,189 --> 02:08:41,199
right that's right that's right so
 

8067
02:08:41,199 --> 02:08:43,750
right that's right that's right so
applauding to me still with all due

8068
02:08:43,750 --> 02:08:43,760
applauding to me still with all due
 

8069
02:08:43,760 --> 02:08:47,189
applauding to me still with all due
respect to matplotlib and bokeh is feels

8070
02:08:47,189 --> 02:08:47,199
respect to matplotlib and bokeh is feels
 

8071
02:08:47,199 --> 02:08:50,950
respect to matplotlib and bokeh is feels
like still an unsolved problem not

8072
02:08:50,950 --> 02:08:50,960
like still an unsolved problem not
 

8073
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:54,470
like still an unsolved problem not
it's a big problem right because you're

8074
02:08:54,470 --> 02:08:54,480
it's a big problem right because you're
 

8075
02:08:54,480 --> 02:08:57,030
it's a big problem right because you're
i mean i don't know it's a visualization

8076
02:08:57,030 --> 02:08:57,040
i mean i don't know it's a visualization
 

8077
02:08:57,040 --> 02:08:59,350
i mean i don't know it's a visualization
broadly yes right i think we've got a

8078
02:08:59,350 --> 02:08:59,360
broadly yes right i think we've got a
 

8079
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:01,669
broadly yes right i think we've got a
pretty good api story around certain use

8080
02:09:01,669 --> 02:09:01,679
pretty good api story around certain use
 

8081
02:09:01,679 --> 02:09:03,430
pretty good api story around certain use
cases of python plotting yeah but

8082
02:09:03,430 --> 02:09:03,440
cases of python plotting yeah but
 

8083
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:04,470
cases of python plotting yeah but
there's a difference between static

8084
02:09:04,470 --> 02:09:04,480
there's a difference between static
 

8085
02:09:04,480 --> 02:09:06,709
there's a difference between static
plots versus interactive plots versus

8086
02:09:06,709 --> 02:09:06,719
plots versus interactive plots versus
 

8087
02:09:06,719 --> 02:09:08,390
plots versus interactive plots versus
i'm an end user i just want to write a

8088
02:09:08,390 --> 02:09:08,400
i'm an end user i just want to write a
 

8089
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:09,830
i'm an end user i just want to write a
simple

8090
02:09:09,830 --> 02:09:09,840
simple
 

8091
02:09:09,840 --> 02:09:11,189
simple
you know pandas started the idea of

8092
02:09:11,189 --> 02:09:11,199
you know pandas started the idea of
 

8093
02:09:11,199 --> 02:09:12,790
you know pandas started the idea of
here's a data frame on a dot plot i'm

8094
02:09:12,790 --> 02:09:12,800
here's a data frame on a dot plot i'm
 

8095
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:14,709
here's a data frame on a dot plot i'm
just going to attach plot as a method to

8096
02:09:14,709 --> 02:09:14,719
just going to attach plot as a method to
 

8097
02:09:14,719 --> 02:09:16,229
just going to attach plot as a method to
my object

8098
02:09:16,229 --> 02:09:16,239
my object
 

8099
02:09:16,239 --> 02:09:17,910
my object
which was a little bit controversial

8100
02:09:17,910 --> 02:09:17,920
which was a little bit controversial
 

8101
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:20,069
which was a little bit controversial
right but works pretty well actually

8102
02:09:20,069 --> 02:09:20,079
right but works pretty well actually
 

8103
02:09:20,079 --> 02:09:20,870
right but works pretty well actually
because

8104
02:09:20,870 --> 02:09:20,880
because
 

8105
02:09:20,880 --> 02:09:23,109
because
there's a lot less you have to pass in

8106
02:09:23,109 --> 02:09:23,119
there's a lot less you have to pass in
 

8107
02:09:23,119 --> 02:09:24,870
there's a lot less you have to pass in
right you can just say here's my object

8108
02:09:24,870 --> 02:09:24,880
right you can just say here's my object
 

8109
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:26,229
right you can just say here's my object
you know what you are

8110
02:09:26,229 --> 02:09:26,239
you know what you are
 

8111
02:09:26,239 --> 02:09:28,950
you know what you are
you tell the visualization what to do

8112
02:09:28,950 --> 02:09:28,960
you tell the visualization what to do
 

8113
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:29,750
you tell the visualization what to do
so

8114
02:09:29,750 --> 02:09:29,760
so
 

8115
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:31,270
so
that and there's things like that that

8116
02:09:31,270 --> 02:09:31,280
that and there's things like that that
 

8117
02:09:31,280 --> 02:09:32,709
that and there's things like that that
have not been you know super well

8118
02:09:32,709 --> 02:09:32,719
have not been you know super well
 

8119
02:09:32,719 --> 02:09:34,790
have not been you know super well
developed entirely but bokeh was focused

8120
02:09:34,790 --> 02:09:34,800
developed entirely but bokeh was focused
 

8121
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:37,109
developed entirely but bokeh was focused
on interactive plotting so you could

8122
02:09:37,109 --> 02:09:37,119
on interactive plotting so you could
 

8123
02:09:37,119 --> 02:09:38,870
on interactive plotting so you could
it's a short path between interactive

8124
02:09:38,870 --> 02:09:38,880
it's a short path between interactive
 

8125
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:40,229
it's a short path between interactive
plotting and

8126
02:09:40,229 --> 02:09:40,239
plotting and
 

8127
02:09:40,239 --> 02:09:42,629
plotting and
application dashboard application and

8128
02:09:42,629 --> 02:09:42,639
application dashboard application and
 

8129
02:09:42,639 --> 02:09:43,830
application dashboard application and
there's some incredible work that got

8130
02:09:43,830 --> 02:09:43,840
there's some incredible work that got
 

8131
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:45,270
there's some incredible work that got
done there right and it was a hard

8132
02:09:45,270 --> 02:09:45,280
done there right and it was a hard
 

8133
02:09:45,280 --> 02:09:46,870
done there right and it was a hard
project because then you're basically

8134
02:09:46,870 --> 02:09:46,880
project because then you're basically
 

8135
02:09:46,880 --> 02:09:49,830
project because then you're basically
doing javascript and python so we we

8136
02:09:49,830 --> 02:09:49,840
doing javascript and python so we we
 

8137
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:51,030
doing javascript and python so we we
wanted to tackle some of these hard

8138
02:09:51,030 --> 02:09:51,040
wanted to tackle some of these hard
 

8139
02:09:51,040 --> 02:09:52,950
wanted to tackle some of these hard
problems and try to and just go after

8140
02:09:52,950 --> 02:09:52,960
problems and try to and just go after
 

8141
02:09:52,960 --> 02:09:54,709
problems and try to and just go after
them we got some darpa funding to help

8142
02:09:54,709 --> 02:09:54,719
them we got some darpa funding to help
 

8143
02:09:54,719 --> 02:09:56,310
them we got some darpa funding to help
and it was super helpful it's a funny

8144
02:09:56,310 --> 02:09:56,320
and it was super helpful it's a funny
 

8145
02:09:56,320 --> 02:09:57,669
and it was super helpful it's a funny
story there we actually did two dark

8146
02:09:57,669 --> 02:09:57,679
story there we actually did two dark
 

8147
02:09:57,679 --> 02:09:59,270
story there we actually did two dark
proposals but one we were five minutes

8148
02:09:59,270 --> 02:09:59,280
proposals but one we were five minutes
 

8149
02:09:59,280 --> 02:10:00,390
proposals but one we were five minutes
late for

8150
02:10:00,390 --> 02:10:00,400
late for
 

8151
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:02,550
late for
and darpa has a very strict cutoff

8152
02:10:02,550 --> 02:10:02,560
and darpa has a very strict cutoff
 

8153
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:04,790
and darpa has a very strict cutoff
window and so i we had two proposals one

8154
02:10:04,790 --> 02:10:04,800
window and so i we had two proposals one
 

8155
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:06,149
window and so i we had two proposals one
for the bokeh and one for actually

8156
02:10:06,149 --> 02:10:06,159
for the bokeh and one for actually
 

8157
02:10:06,159 --> 02:10:09,189
for the bokeh and one for actually
number and the the other work

8158
02:10:09,189 --> 02:10:09,199
number and the the other work
 

8159
02:10:09,199 --> 02:10:10,790
number and the the other work
which one were you late for

8160
02:10:10,790 --> 02:10:10,800
which one were you late for
 

8161
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:14,709
which one were you late for
the foundational numerical work so

8162
02:10:14,709 --> 02:10:14,719
the foundational numerical work so
 

8163
02:10:14,719 --> 02:10:16,310
the foundational numerical work so
fortunately chris let us use some of the

8164
02:10:16,310 --> 02:10:16,320
fortunately chris let us use some of the
 

8165
02:10:16,320 --> 02:10:17,669
fortunately chris let us use some of the
money to fund still some of the other

8166
02:10:17,669 --> 02:10:17,679
money to fund still some of the other
 

8167
02:10:17,679 --> 02:10:19,109
money to fund still some of the other
foundational work

8168
02:10:19,109 --> 02:10:19,119
foundational work
 

8169
02:10:19,119 --> 02:10:20,390
foundational work
but it wasn't as

8170
02:10:20,390 --> 02:10:20,400
but it wasn't as
 

8171
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:22,149
but it wasn't as
yeah his hands were tired he couldn't do

8172
02:10:22,149 --> 02:10:22,159
yeah his hands were tired he couldn't do
 

8173
02:10:22,159 --> 02:10:23,669
yeah his hands were tired he couldn't do
anything about it uh

8174
02:10:23,669 --> 02:10:23,679
anything about it uh
 

8175
02:10:23,679 --> 02:10:25,669
anything about it uh
that was a whole interesting story

8176
02:10:25,669 --> 02:10:25,679
that was a whole interesting story
 

8177
02:10:25,679 --> 02:10:27,669
that was a whole interesting story
so one of the incredible projects that

8178
02:10:27,669 --> 02:10:27,679
so one of the incredible projects that
 

8179
02:10:27,679 --> 02:10:30,550
so one of the incredible projects that
you worked on is conda yes so what is

8180
02:10:30,550 --> 02:10:30,560
you worked on is conda yes so what is
 

8181
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:33,910
you worked on is conda yes so what is
that about yeah conda it was early on

8182
02:10:33,910 --> 02:10:33,920
that about yeah conda it was early on
 

8183
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:35,910
that about yeah conda it was early on
like i said with scipy sci-fi was a

8184
02:10:35,910 --> 02:10:35,920
like i said with scipy sci-fi was a
 

8185
02:10:35,920 --> 02:10:37,910
like i said with scipy sci-fi was a
distribution masculine library and he

8186
02:10:37,910 --> 02:10:37,920
distribution masculine library and he
 

8187
02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:39,830
distribution masculine library and he
said talk to me talking about compiler

8188
02:10:39,830 --> 02:10:39,840
said talk to me talking about compiler
 

8189
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:41,030
said talk to me talking about compiler
issues and trying to get the stuff

8190
02:10:41,030 --> 02:10:41,040
issues and trying to get the stuff
 

8191
02:10:41,040 --> 02:10:42,629
issues and trying to get the stuff
shipped and the fact that people can use

8192
02:10:42,629 --> 02:10:42,639
shipped and the fact that people can use
 

8193
02:10:42,639 --> 02:10:44,470
shipped and the fact that people can use
your libraries that they have it

8194
02:10:44,470 --> 02:10:44,480
your libraries that they have it
 

8195
02:10:44,480 --> 02:10:45,990
your libraries that they have it
so for a long time we've understood the

8196
02:10:45,990 --> 02:10:46,000
so for a long time we've understood the
 

8197
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,310
so for a long time we've understood the
packaging problem in python and one of

8198
02:10:48,310 --> 02:10:48,320
packaging problem in python and one of
 

8199
02:10:48,320 --> 02:10:49,750
packaging problem in python and one of
the first things you did at that

8200
02:10:49,750 --> 02:10:49,760
the first things you did at that
 

8201
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:51,910
the first things you did at that
consumer analytics became anaconda

8202
02:10:51,910 --> 02:10:51,920
consumer analytics became anaconda
 

8203
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:54,149
consumer analytics became anaconda
was organize the pi data ecosystem in

8204
02:10:54,149 --> 02:10:54,159
was organize the pi data ecosystem in
 

8205
02:10:54,159 --> 02:10:56,470
was organize the pi data ecosystem in
conjunction with num focus we actually

8206
02:10:56,470 --> 02:10:56,480
conjunction with num focus we actually
 

8207
02:10:56,480 --> 02:10:59,510
conjunction with num focus we actually
started num focus uh uh with some other

8208
02:10:59,510 --> 02:10:59,520
started num focus uh uh with some other
 

8209
02:10:59,520 --> 02:11:01,109
started num focus uh uh with some other
folks in the community the same year we

8210
02:11:01,109 --> 02:11:01,119
folks in the community the same year we
 

8211
02:11:01,119 --> 02:11:03,189
folks in the community the same year we
started anaconda i said we're going to

8212
02:11:03,189 --> 02:11:03,199
started anaconda i said we're going to
 

8213
02:11:03,199 --> 02:11:05,109
started anaconda i said we're going to
build a corporation but also got to

8214
02:11:05,109 --> 02:11:05,119
build a corporation but also got to
 

8215
02:11:05,119 --> 02:11:07,189
build a corporation but also got to
reify the community aspect and build a

8216
02:11:07,189 --> 02:11:07,199
reify the community aspect and build a
 

8217
02:11:07,199 --> 02:11:09,510
reify the community aspect and build a
nonprofit so we do both of those can we

8218
02:11:09,510 --> 02:11:09,520
nonprofit so we do both of those can we
 

8219
02:11:09,520 --> 02:11:11,910
nonprofit so we do both of those can we
pause real quick and and uh can you say

8220
02:11:11,910 --> 02:11:11,920
pause real quick and and uh can you say
 

8221
02:11:11,920 --> 02:11:14,629
pause real quick and and uh can you say
what is pi pi the python package index

8222
02:11:14,629 --> 02:11:14,639
what is pi pi the python package index
 

8223
02:11:14,639 --> 02:11:16,229
what is pi pi the python package index
like this whole

8224
02:11:16,229 --> 02:11:16,239
like this whole
 

8225
02:11:16,239 --> 02:11:19,270
like this whole
story yeah of packaging in python yeah

8226
02:11:19,270 --> 02:11:19,280
story yeah of packaging in python yeah
 

8227
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:20,790
story yeah of packaging in python yeah
that's what i'm going to get to actually

8228
02:11:20,790 --> 02:11:20,800
that's what i'm going to get to actually
 

8229
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:22,229
that's what i'm going to get to actually
this is exactly the journey i'm honest

8230
02:11:22,229 --> 02:11:22,239
this is exactly the journey i'm honest
 

8231
02:11:22,239 --> 02:11:24,149
this is exactly the journey i'm honest
to sort of explain packaging in python i

8232
02:11:24,149 --> 02:11:24,159
to sort of explain packaging in python i
 

8233
02:11:24,159 --> 02:11:25,350
to sort of explain packaging in python i
think it's best expressed so the

8234
02:11:25,350 --> 02:11:25,360
think it's best expressed so the
 

8235
02:11:25,360 --> 02:11:26,629
think it's best expressed so the
conversation i had with guido at a

8236
02:11:26,629 --> 02:11:26,639
conversation i had with guido at a
 

8237
02:11:26,639 --> 02:11:29,350
conversation i had with guido at a
conference where i said so

8238
02:11:29,350 --> 02:11:29,360
conference where i said so
 

8239
02:11:29,360 --> 02:11:30,709
conference where i said so
you know yeah packaging is kind of a

8240
02:11:30,709 --> 02:11:30,719
you know yeah packaging is kind of a
 

8241
02:11:30,719 --> 02:11:32,870
you know yeah packaging is kind of a
problem megiddo said i don't ever care

8242
02:11:32,870 --> 02:11:32,880
problem megiddo said i don't ever care
 

8243
02:11:32,880 --> 02:11:35,189
problem megiddo said i don't ever care
about packaging i don't use it i don't

8244
02:11:35,189 --> 02:11:35,199
about packaging i don't use it i don't
 

8245
02:11:35,199 --> 02:11:37,109
about packaging i don't use it i don't
install new libraries i'm like i guess

8246
02:11:37,109 --> 02:11:37,119
install new libraries i'm like i guess
 

8247
02:11:37,119 --> 02:11:38,229
install new libraries i'm like i guess
if you're the language creator and if

8248
02:11:38,229 --> 02:11:38,239
if you're the language creator and if
 

8249
02:11:38,239 --> 02:11:39,669
if you're the language creator and if
you need something just put it put it in

8250
02:11:39,669 --> 02:11:39,679
you need something just put it put it in
 

8251
02:11:39,679 --> 02:11:41,109
you need something just put it put it in
the distribution maybe you don't worry

8252
02:11:41,109 --> 02:11:41,119
the distribution maybe you don't worry
 

8253
02:11:41,119 --> 02:11:42,310
the distribution maybe you don't worry
about packaging

8254
02:11:42,310 --> 02:11:42,320
about packaging
 

8255
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:44,149
about packaging
but guido has never really cared about

8256
02:11:44,149 --> 02:11:44,159
but guido has never really cared about
 

8257
02:11:44,159 --> 02:11:46,069
but guido has never really cared about
packaging right and never really cared

8258
02:11:46,069 --> 02:11:46,079
packaging right and never really cared
 

8259
02:11:46,079 --> 02:11:47,270
packaging right and never really cared
about the problem of distribution

8260
02:11:47,270 --> 02:11:47,280
about the problem of distribution
 

8261
02:11:47,280 --> 02:11:48,870
about the problem of distribution
somebody else's problem and that's a

8262
02:11:48,870 --> 02:11:48,880
somebody else's problem and that's a
 

8263
02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:50,229
somebody else's problem and that's a
fair position to take i think as a

8264
02:11:50,229 --> 02:11:50,239
fair position to take i think as a
 

8265
02:11:50,239 --> 02:11:51,510
fair position to take i think as a
language creator

8266
02:11:51,510 --> 02:11:51,520
language creator
 

8267
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:52,629
language creator
in fact there's a

8268
02:11:52,629 --> 02:11:52,639
in fact there's a
 

8269
02:11:52,639 --> 02:11:54,390
in fact there's a
philosophical question about should you

8270
02:11:54,390 --> 02:11:54,400
philosophical question about should you
 

8271
02:11:54,400 --> 02:11:55,750
philosophical question about should you
have different development packaging

8272
02:11:55,750 --> 02:11:55,760
have different development packaging
 

8273
02:11:55,760 --> 02:11:57,350
have different development packaging
managers should you have a package

8274
02:11:57,350 --> 02:11:57,360
managers should you have a package
 

8275
02:11:57,360 --> 02:11:58,790
managers should you have a package
manager per language is that really the

8276
02:11:58,790 --> 02:11:58,800
manager per language is that really the
 

8277
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:00,550
manager per language is that really the
right approach i think there are some

8278
02:12:00,550 --> 02:12:00,560
right approach i think there are some
 

8279
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:01,750
right approach i think there are some
answers of

8280
02:12:01,750 --> 02:12:01,760
answers of
 

8281
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:03,189
answers of
it is appropriate to have development

8282
02:12:03,189 --> 02:12:03,199
it is appropriate to have development
 

8283
02:12:03,199 --> 02:12:05,350
it is appropriate to have development
tools and there's an aspect of

8284
02:12:05,350 --> 02:12:05,360
tools and there's an aspect of
 

8285
02:12:05,360 --> 02:12:06,709
tools and there's an aspect of
development tool that is related to

8286
02:12:06,709 --> 02:12:06,719
development tool that is related to
 

8287
02:12:06,719 --> 02:12:08,870
development tool that is related to
packaging and every language should have

8288
02:12:08,870 --> 02:12:08,880
packaging and every language should have
 

8289
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:09,750
packaging and every language should have
some

8290
02:12:09,750 --> 02:12:09,760
some
 

8291
02:12:09,760 --> 02:12:11,510
some
story there to help their developers

8292
02:12:11,510 --> 02:12:11,520
story there to help their developers
 

8293
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:13,270
story there to help their developers
create so you should have language

8294
02:12:13,270 --> 02:12:13,280
create so you should have language
 

8295
02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:15,189
create so you should have language
specific language tools development

8296
02:12:15,189 --> 02:12:15,199
specific language tools development
 

8297
02:12:15,199 --> 02:12:16,950
specific language tools development
tools that relate to package managers

8298
02:12:16,950 --> 02:12:16,960
tools that relate to package managers
 

8299
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:19,030
tools that relate to package managers
but then there's a very specific user

8300
02:12:19,030 --> 02:12:19,040
but then there's a very specific user
 

8301
02:12:19,040 --> 02:12:20,629
but then there's a very specific user
story around package management that

8302
02:12:20,629 --> 02:12:20,639
story around package management that
 

8303
02:12:20,639 --> 02:12:22,229
story around package management that
those language specific package managers

8304
02:12:22,229 --> 02:12:22,239
those language specific package managers
 

8305
02:12:22,239 --> 02:12:23,990
those language specific package managers
have to interact with and currently

8306
02:12:23,990 --> 02:12:24,000
have to interact with and currently
 

8307
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:25,990
have to interact with and currently
aren't doing a good job of that that was

8308
02:12:25,990 --> 02:12:26,000
aren't doing a good job of that that was
 

8309
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,229
aren't doing a good job of that that was
one of the challenges that if not seeing

02:12:28,229 --> 02:12:28,239
one of the challenges that if not seeing

one of the challenges that if not seeing
that difference and it still exists in

how do i get this installed it was

02:12:39,589 --> 02:12:39,599
how do i get this installed it was
 

8325
02:12:39,599 --> 02:12:41,669
how do i get this installed it was
always focused on that so it didn't have

always focused on that so it didn't have

like a develop you know

8328
02:12:43,750 --> 02:12:43,760
like a develop you know
 

8329
02:12:43,760 --> 02:12:45,830
like a develop you know
classic example is pip has a pip develop

8330
02:12:45,830 --> 02:12:45,840
classic example is pip has a pip develop
 

8331
02:12:45,840 --> 02:12:47,750
classic example is pip has a pip develop
it's like i want to install this into my

now
 

8337
02:12:50,159 --> 02:12:51,589

we're not making changes to a library
 

8435
02:14:14,560 --> 02:14:15,910
we're not making changes to a library
because of the installation problem that

8436
02:14:15,910 --> 02:14:15,920
because of the installation problem that
 

8437
02:14:15,920 --> 02:14:17,830
because of the installation problem that
it'll cause for end users okay there's a

it'll cause for end users okay there's a
 

8439
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:18,870
it'll cause for end users okay there's a
problem with pac there's a problem with

installation we've got to fix this so we
 

8443
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:22,310
installation we've got to fix this so we
we we said we're going to make a

8444
02:14:22,310 --> 02:14:22,320
we we said we're going to make a
 

8445
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:23,910
we we said we're going to make a
distribution of python and we'd

8446
02:14:23,910 --> 02:14:23,920
distribution of python and we'd
 

8447
02:14:23,920 --> 02:14:25,109
distribution of python and we'd
previously done that previously done

8448
02:14:25,109 --> 02:14:25,119
previously done that previously done
 

8449
02:14:25,119 --> 02:14:26,709
previously done that previously done
that at m thought

8450
02:14:26,709 --> 02:14:26,719
that at m thought
 

8451
02:14:26,719 --> 02:14:27,750
that at m thought
i wanted to make one that would give

8452
02:14:27,750 --> 02:14:27,760
i wanted to make one that would give
 

8453
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:29,669
i wanted to make one that would give
away for free everyone could just get

8454
02:14:29,669 --> 02:14:29,679
away for free everyone could just get
 

8455
02:14:29,679 --> 02:14:31,270
away for free everyone could just get
like that was critical that we just get

8456
02:14:31,270 --> 02:14:31,280
like that was critical that we just get
 

8457
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:33,669
like that was critical that we just get
it you know it wasn't tied to a product

8458
02:14:33,669 --> 02:14:33,679
it you know it wasn't tied to a product
 

8459
02:14:33,679 --> 02:14:35,189
it you know it wasn't tied to a product
it was just you could get it

8460
02:14:35,189 --> 02:14:35,199
it was just you could get it
 

8461
02:14:35,199 --> 02:14:36,709
it was just you could get it
and then we had constantly thought about

8462
02:14:36,709 --> 02:14:36,719
and then we had constantly thought about
 

8463
02:14:36,719 --> 02:14:39,270
and then we had constantly thought about
well do we just leverage rpm do we but

8464
02:14:39,270 --> 02:14:39,280
well do we just leverage rpm do we but
 

8465
02:14:39,280 --> 02:14:40,550
well do we just leverage rpm do we but
the challenge had always been we want a

8466
02:14:40,550 --> 02:14:40,560
the challenge had always been we want a
 

8467
02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:42,069
the challenge had always been we want a

right and it wasn't there like you don't

8472
02:14:46,870 --> 02:14:46,880
right and it wasn't there like you don't
 

8473

correct it's an operating specific yes
 

8481
02:14:56,400 --> 02:14:59,510
correct it's an operating specific yes
so do you create the the design uh

8482
02:14:59,510 --> 02:14:59,520
so do you create the the design uh
 

8483
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:01,350
so do you create the the design uh
questions do you create an umbrella

8484
02:15:01,350 --> 02:15:01,360
questions do you create an umbrella
 

8485
02:15:01,360 --> 02:15:03,510
questions do you create an umbrella
package manager then yes cross operating

8486

system yes that was the decision and a

8488
02:15:05,830 --> 02:15:05,840
system yes that was the decision and a
 

8489
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:08,470
system yes that was the decision and a
neighboring design question is do you

8490
02:15:08,470 --> 02:15:08,480
neighboring design question is do you
 

8491
02:15:08,480 --> 02:15:10,310
neighboring design question is do you
also create a package manager that spans

8492
02:15:10,310 --> 02:15:10,320
also create a package manager that spans

02:17:35,270 --> 02:17:35,280
have to
 

8649
02:17:35,280 --> 02:17:37,750
have to
vendor you have to take all the binary

8650
02:17:37,750 --> 02:17:37,760
vendor you have to take all the binary
 

8651
02:17:37,760 --> 02:17:39,429
vendor you have to take all the binary
and vendor it now if your change happens

8652
02:17:39,429 --> 02:17:39,439
and vendor it now if your change happens
 

8653
02:17:39,439 --> 02:17:41,190
and vendor it now if your change happens
underlying dependency

8654
02:17:41,190 --> 02:17:41,200
underlying dependency
 

8655
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:43,669
underlying dependency
you have to redo the whole wheel so

8656
02:17:43,669 --> 02:17:43,679
you have to redo the whole wheel so
 

8657
02:17:43,679 --> 02:17:45,589
you have to redo the whole wheel so
tensorflow is a good example but you

8658
02:17:45,589 --> 02:17:45,599
tensorflow is a good example but you
 

8659
02:17:45,599 --> 02:17:47,349
tensorflow is a good example but you
should not pip install tensorflow it's a

8660
02:17:47,349 --> 02:17:47,359
should not pip install tensorflow it's a
 

8661
02:17:47,359 --> 02:17:49,990
should not pip install tensorflow it's a
terrible idea people do it because

8662
02:17:49,990 --> 02:17:50,000
terrible idea people do it because
 

8663
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:51,830
terrible idea people do it because
the popularity of pip many people think

8664
02:17:51,830 --> 02:17:51,840
the popularity of pip many people think
 

8665
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:52,870
the popularity of pip many people think
of course that's how i install

8666
02:17:52,870 --> 02:17:52,880
of course that's how i install
 

8667
02:17:52,880 --> 02:17:55,030
of course that's how i install
everything python yeah this is one of

8668
02:17:55,030 --> 02:17:55,040
everything python yeah this is one of
 

8669
02:17:55,040 --> 02:17:56,389
everything python yeah this is one of
the big challenges

8670
02:17:56,389 --> 02:17:56,399
the big challenges
 

8671
02:17:56,399 --> 02:17:58,709
the big challenges
you know you take a github repository or

8672
02:17:58,709 --> 02:17:58,719
you know you take a github repository or
 

8673
02:17:58,719 --> 02:18:01,110
you know you take a github repository or
just a basic blog post the number of

8674
02:18:01,110 --> 02:18:01,120
just a basic blog post the number of
 

8675
02:18:01,120 --> 02:18:03,750
just a basic blog post the number of
times pip is mentioned over conda is

8676
02:18:03,750 --> 02:18:03,760
times pip is mentioned over conda is
 

8677
02:18:03,760 --> 02:18:06,549
times pip is mentioned over conda is
like 100x to one correct correct so they

8678
02:18:06,549 --> 02:18:06,559
like 100x to one correct correct so they
 

8679
02:18:06,559 --> 02:18:07,910
like 100x to one correct correct so they
just haven't that was increasing it

8680
02:18:07,910 --> 02:18:07,920
just haven't that was increasing it
 

8681
02:18:07,920 --> 02:18:09,589
just haven't that was increasing it
wasn't true early because pip didn't

8682
02:18:09,589 --> 02:18:09,599
wasn't true early because pip didn't
 

8683
02:18:09,599 --> 02:18:11,910
wasn't true early because pip didn't
exist like conda came first so but

8684
02:18:11,910 --> 02:18:11,920
exist like conda came first so but
 

8685
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:13,190
exist like conda came first so but
that's like the long tail of the

8686
02:18:13,190 --> 02:18:13,200
that's like the long tail of the
 

8687
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:15,910
that's like the long tail of the
internet documentation user generated so

8688
02:18:15,910 --> 02:18:15,920
internet documentation user generated so
 

8689
02:18:15,920 --> 02:18:18,709
internet documentation user generated so
that like you think how do i install

8690
02:18:18,709 --> 02:18:18,719
that like you think how do i install
 

8691
02:18:18,719 --> 02:18:20,389
that like you think how do i install
google how do i install tensorflow

8692
02:18:20,389 --> 02:18:20,399
google how do i install tensorflow
 

8693
02:18:20,399 --> 02:18:21,910

you're just not going to see conda in

8694
02:18:21,910 --> 02:18:21,920
you're just not going to see conda in
 

8695
02:18:21,920 --> 02:18:24,549
you're just not going to see conda in

correct like for especially super

8706
02:18:35,750 --> 02:18:35,760
correct like for especially super
 

8707
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:37,509
correct like for especially super
challenging thing i don't know one of

8708
02:18:37,509 --> 02:18:37,519
challenging thing i don't know one of
 

8709
02:18:37,519 --> 02:18:39,669
challenging thing i don't know one of
the big pain points for me was uh just

8710
02:18:39,669 --> 02:18:39,679
the big pain points for me was uh just
 

8711
02:18:39,679 --> 02:18:42,629
the big pain points for me was uh just
on the computer vision side uh opencv

8712
02:18:42,629 --> 02:18:42,639
on the computer vision side uh opencv
 

8713
02:18:42,639 --> 02:18:44,230
on the computer vision side uh opencv
yeah installation that perfect example

8714
02:18:44,230 --> 02:18:44,240
yeah installation that perfect example
 

8715
02:18:44,240 --> 02:18:46,469
yeah installation that perfect example
yes i think is i don't know if

8716
02:18:46,469 --> 02:18:46,479
yes i think is i don't know if
 

8717
02:18:46,479 --> 02:18:48,389
yes i think is i don't know if
condos solved that pun has an open cv

8718
02:18:48,389 --> 02:18:48,399
condos solved that pun has an open cv
 

8719
02:18:48,399 --> 02:18:50,709
condos solved that pun has an open cv
package i don't know i i certainly know

8720
02:18:50,709 --> 02:18:50,719
package i don't know i i certainly know
 

8721
02:18:50,719 --> 02:18:53,349
package i don't know i i certainly know
pip has not solved

8722
02:18:53,349 --> 02:18:53,359
pip has not solved
 

8723
02:18:53,359 --> 02:18:55,030
pip has not solved
i mean there's complexities there

8724
02:18:55,030 --> 02:18:55,040
i mean there's complexities there
 

8725
02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:57,669
i mean there's complexities there
because right i actually don't know i

8726
02:18:57,669 --> 02:18:57,679
because right i actually don't know i
 

8727
02:18:57,679 --> 02:18:58,870
because right i actually don't know i
should probably know a good answer for

8728
02:18:58,870 --> 02:18:58,880
should probably know a good answer for
 

8729
02:18:58,880 --> 02:18:59,750
should probably know a good answer for
this but

8730
02:18:59,750 --> 02:18:59,760
this but
 

8731
02:18:59,760 --> 02:19:02,549
this but
you know if if you compile

8732
02:19:02,549 --> 02:19:02,559
you know if if you compile
 

8733
02:19:02,559 --> 02:19:05,270
you know if if you compile
opencv with certain dependencies

8734
02:19:05,270 --> 02:19:05,280
opencv with certain dependencies
 

8735
02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:07,509
opencv with certain dependencies
you'll be able to do certain things so

8736
02:19:07,509 --> 02:19:07,519
you'll be able to do certain things so
 

8737
02:19:07,519 --> 02:19:09,589
you'll be able to do certain things so
there's this kind of flexibility of what

8738
02:19:09,589 --> 02:19:09,599
there's this kind of flexibility of what
 

8739
02:19:09,599 --> 02:19:11,910
there's this kind of flexibility of what
you like what br what options you

8740
02:19:11,910 --> 02:19:11,920
you like what br what options you
 

8741
02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:14,629
you like what br what options you
compile with yes and i don't think it's

8742
02:19:14,629 --> 02:19:14,639
compile with yes and i don't think it's
 

8743
02:19:14,639 --> 02:19:17,669
compile with yes and i don't think it's
trivial to do that in with condor or or

8744
02:19:17,669 --> 02:19:17,679
trivial to do that in with condor or or
 

8745
02:19:17,679 --> 02:19:19,750
trivial to do that in with condor or or
so has a notion of variance

8746
02:19:19,750 --> 02:19:19,760
so has a notion of variance
 

8747
02:19:19,760 --> 02:19:21,589
so has a notion of variance
of a package you can actually have

8748
02:19:21,589 --> 02:19:21,599
of a package you can actually have
 

8749
02:19:21,599 --> 02:19:23,110
of a package you can actually have
different compilation versions of a

8750
02:19:23,110 --> 02:19:23,120
different compilation versions of a
 

8751
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:24,309
different compilation versions of a
package so not just the version's

8752
02:19:24,309 --> 02:19:24,319
package so not just the version's
 

8753
02:19:24,319 --> 02:19:25,349
package so not just the version's
different but oh this is compiled with

8754
02:19:25,349 --> 02:19:25,359
different but oh this is compiled with
 

8755
02:19:25,359 --> 02:19:26,709
different but oh this is compiled with
these optimizations

8756
02:19:26,709 --> 02:19:26,719
these optimizations
 

8757
02:19:26,719 --> 02:19:28,230
these optimizations
so kana does have an answer to those

8758
02:19:28,230 --> 02:19:28,240
so kana does have an answer to those
 

8759
02:19:28,240 --> 02:19:30,709
so kana does have an answer to those
flavors that's flavors basically

02:19:30,709 --> 02:19:30,719
flavors that's flavors basically
 

8761
02:19:30,719 --> 02:19:33,509

as far as i know does not no no pip

8762
02:19:33,509 --> 02:19:33,519
as far as i know does not no no pip
 

8763
02:19:33,519 --> 02:19:34,389
as far as i know does not no no pip
generally

8764
02:19:34,389 --> 02:19:34,399
generally
 

8765
02:19:34,399 --> 02:19:37,110
generally
hasn't thought deeply about the binary

8766
02:19:37,110 --> 02:19:37,120
hasn't thought deeply about the binary
 

8767
02:19:37,120 --> 02:19:38,549
hasn't thought deeply about the binary
dependency problem right and that's

8768
02:19:38,549 --> 02:19:38,559
dependency problem right and that's
 

8769
02:19:38,559 --> 02:19:41,030
dependency problem right and that's
that's why fundamentally it it doesn't

8770
02:19:41,030 --> 02:19:41,040
that's why fundamentally it it doesn't
 

8771
02:19:41,040 --> 02:19:44,070
that's why fundamentally it it doesn't
work for the sci-fi ecosystem it barely

8772
02:19:44,070 --> 02:19:44,080
work for the sci-fi ecosystem it barely
 

8773
02:19:44,080 --> 02:19:45,589
work for the sci-fi ecosystem it barely
it you can sort of paper over it and

8774
02:19:45,589 --> 02:19:45,599
it you can sort of paper over it and
 

8775
02:19:45,599 --> 02:19:47,589
it you can sort of paper over it and
duct tape and it kind of works until it

8776
02:19:47,589 --> 02:19:47,599
duct tape and it kind of works until it
 

8777
02:19:47,599 --> 02:19:50,070
duct tape and it kind of works until it
doesn't it falls apart entirely so it's

8778
02:19:50,070 --> 02:19:50,080
doesn't it falls apart entirely so it's
 

8779
02:19:50,080 --> 02:19:52,469
doesn't it falls apart entirely so it's
been a mixed bag like

8780
02:19:52,469 --> 02:19:52,479
been a mixed bag like
 

8781
02:19:52,479 --> 02:19:53,830
been a mixed bag like
and i've been having lots of

8782
02:19:53,830 --> 02:19:53,840
and i've been having lots of
 

8783
02:19:53,840 --> 02:19:55,030
and i've been having lots of
conversations with people over the years

8784
02:19:55,030 --> 02:19:55,040
conversations with people over the years
 

8785
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:57,030
conversations with people over the years
because again it's an area where if you

because again it's an area where if you
 

8787
02:19:57,040 --> 02:19:58,550
because again it's an area where if you
if you understand some things but not

8788
02:19:58,550 --> 02:19:58,560
if you understand some things but not
 

8789
02:19:58,560 --> 02:19:59,990
if you understand some things but not
all the things but they've done a great

02:19:59,990 --> 02:20:00,000
all the things but they've done a great
 

8791
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:01,270
all the things but they've done a great
job of

think anaconda

8796
02:20:04,550 --> 02:20:04,560
think anaconda
 

8797
02:20:04,560 --> 02:20:06,870
think anaconda
uh as a company needed to do some things

8798
02:20:06,870 --> 02:20:06,880
uh as a company needed to do some things
 

8799
02:20:06,880 --> 02:20:08,070

make condom more community-centric right
 

8803

the
not like anika shouldn't be fighting

8878
02:21:25,270 --> 02:21:25,280
not like anika shouldn't be fighting
 

8879
02:21:25,280 --> 02:21:27,190
not like anika shouldn't be fighting
this battle yeah right it's actually uh

8880
02:21:27,190 --> 02:21:27,200
this battle yeah right it's actually uh
 

8881
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:28,950
this battle yeah right it's actually uh
it's really the developers like you said

8882
02:21:28,950 --> 02:21:28,960
it's really the developers like you said
 

8883
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:30,550
it's really the developers like you said
like help the developers yeah and then

8884
02:21:30,550 --> 02:21:30,560
like help the developers yeah and then
 

8885
02:21:30,560 --> 02:21:31,670
like help the developers yeah and then
they'll actually move us the right

8886
02:21:31,670 --> 02:21:31,680
they'll actually move us the right
 

8887
02:21:31,680 --> 02:21:33,110
they'll actually move us the right
direction but that was the problem i

8888
02:21:33,110 --> 02:21:33,120
direction but that was the problem i
 

8889
02:21:33,120 --> 02:21:35,030
direction but that was the problem i
have as many of the cool kids i know

8890
02:21:35,030 --> 02:21:35,040
have as many of the cool kids i know
 

8891
02:21:35,040 --> 02:21:37,590
have as many of the cool kids i know
don't use conda and that to me is

8892
02:21:37,590 --> 02:21:37,600
don't use conda and that to me is
 

8893
02:21:37,600 --> 02:21:40,230
don't use conda and that to me is
confusing it is confusing and it's

8894
02:21:40,230 --> 02:21:40,240
confusing it is confusing and it's
 

8895
02:21:40,240 --> 02:21:41,830
confusing it is confusing and it's
really a matter of kind of has some

8896
02:21:41,830 --> 02:21:41,840
really a matter of kind of has some
 

8897
02:21:41,840 --> 02:21:43,270
really a matter of kind of has some
challenges first of all kind of still

8898
02:21:43,270 --> 02:21:43,280
challenges first of all kind of still
 

8899
02:21:43,280 --> 02:21:44,230
challenges first of all kind of still
needs to be improved there's lots of

8900
02:21:44,230 --> 02:21:44,240
needs to be improved there's lots of
 

8901
02:21:44,240 --> 02:21:45,910
needs to be improved there's lots of
improvements we made and that it's that

8902
02:21:45,910 --> 02:21:45,920
improvements we made and that it's that
 

8903
02:21:45,920 --> 02:21:47,670
improvements we made and that it's that
aspect of wait who's doing this and the

8904
02:21:47,670 --> 02:21:47,680
aspect of wait who's doing this and the
 

8905
02:21:47,680 --> 02:21:50,150
aspect of wait who's doing this and the
fact that then the pipea really stepped

8906
02:21:50,150 --> 02:21:50,160
fact that then the pipea really stepped
 

8907
02:21:50,160 --> 02:21:52,070
fact that then the pipea really stepped
up like they were not solving the

8908
02:21:52,070 --> 02:21:52,080
up like they were not solving the
 

8909
02:21:52,080 --> 02:21:54,150
up like they were not solving the
problem at all and now they kind of got

8910
02:21:54,150 --> 02:21:54,160
problem at all and now they kind of got
 

8911
02:21:54,160 --> 02:21:55,990
problem at all and now they kind of got
to where they're solving it for the most

8912
02:21:55,990 --> 02:21:56,000
to where they're solving it for the most
 

8913
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:57,990
to where they're solving it for the most
part and then effectively you could get

8914
02:21:57,990 --> 02:21:58,000
part and then effectively you could get
 

8915
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:59,750
part and then effectively you could get
like conda solved a problem that was

8916
02:21:59,750 --> 02:21:59,760
like conda solved a problem that was
 

8917
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:01,750
like conda solved a problem that was
there and it still does and it's still

8918
02:22:01,750 --> 02:22:01,760
there and it still does and it's still
 

8919
02:22:01,760 --> 02:22:02,870
there and it still does and it's still
you know there's still great things it

8920
02:22:02,870 --> 02:22:02,880
you know there's still great things it
 

8921
02:22:02,880 --> 02:22:03,830
you know there's still great things it
can do

8922
02:22:03,830 --> 02:22:03,840
can do
 

8923
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:05,990
can do
but um and we still use it all the time

8924
02:22:05,990 --> 02:22:06,000
but um and we still use it all the time
 

8925
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:07,990
but um and we still use it all the time
at quansite and with other clients but

8926
02:22:07,990 --> 02:22:08,000
at quansite and with other clients but
 

8927
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,389
at quansite and with other clients but
with uh but you can kind of do similar

8928
02:22:10,389 --> 02:22:10,399
with uh but you can kind of do similar
 

8929
02:22:10,399 --> 02:22:11,990
with uh but you can kind of do similar
things with pip and docker

8930
02:22:11,990 --> 02:22:12,000
things with pip and docker
 

8931
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:13,670
things with pip and docker
right so

8932
02:22:13,670 --> 02:22:13,680
right so
 

8933
02:22:13,680 --> 02:22:14,870
right so
especially with the web development

8934
02:22:14,870 --> 02:22:14,880
especially with the web development
 

8935
02:22:14,880 --> 02:22:16,230
especially with the web development
community that part of it again is this

8936
02:22:16,230 --> 02:22:16,240
community that part of it again is this
 

8937
02:22:16,240 --> 02:22:18,550
community that part of it again is this
is the there's a lot of different kind

8938
02:22:18,550 --> 02:22:18,560
is the there's a lot of different kind
 

8939
02:22:18,560 --> 02:22:20,070
is the there's a lot of different kind
of developers in the python ecosystem

8940
02:22:20,070 --> 02:22:20,080
of developers in the python ecosystem
 

8941
02:22:20,080 --> 02:22:20,950

and
 

8943
02:22:20,960 --> 02:22:22,870
and
there's still a lack of of some clear

8944
02:22:22,870 --> 02:22:22,880
there's still a lack of of some clear
 

8945
02:22:22,880 --> 02:22:24,389
there's still a lack of of some clear
understanding i go to the python

8946
02:22:24,389 --> 02:22:24,399

8949
02:22:25,760 --> 02:22:28,230
conference all the time and there's only
a few people in the pipea who get it and

8950
02:22:28,230 --> 02:22:28,240
a few people in the pipea who get it and
 

8951
02:22:28,240 --> 02:22:30,070
a few people in the pipea who get it and
then others who are just massively

8952
02:22:30,070 --> 02:22:30,080
then others who are just massively
 

8953
02:22:30,080 --> 02:22:31,750

from a non-programmer perspective is the

8960
02:22:38,309 --> 02:22:38,319
from a non-programmer perspective is the
 

8961
02:22:38,319 --> 02:22:39,750
from a non-programmer perspective is the
across

8962
02:22:39,750 --> 02:22:39,760
across
 

8963
02:22:39,760 --> 02:22:41,990
across
operating system usability that's much

8964
02:22:41,990 --> 02:22:42,000
operating system usability that's much
 

8965
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,309
operating system usability that's much
more natural so yeah they use

8966
02:22:44,309 --> 02:22:44,319
more natural so yeah they use
 

8967
02:22:44,319 --> 02:22:46,950
more natural so yeah they use
windows and just it seems much easier to

8968
02:22:46,950 --> 02:22:46,960
windows and just it seems much easier to
 

8969
02:22:46,960 --> 02:22:49,670
windows and just it seems much easier to
uh to recommend conda there but then it

8970
02:22:49,670 --> 02:22:49,680
uh to recommend conda there but then it
 

8971
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:51,510
uh to recommend conda there but then it
you should also recommend it across the

8972
02:22:51,510 --> 02:22:51,520
you should also recommend it across the
 

8973
02:22:51,520 --> 02:22:53,510
you should also recommend it across the
board so i'll i'll definitely surf but

8974
02:22:53,510 --> 02:22:53,520
board so i'll i'll definitely surf but
 

8975
02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:55,670
board so i'll i'll definitely surf but
what i recommend now is a hybrid i do i

8976
02:22:55,670 --> 02:22:55,680
what i recommend now is a hybrid i do i
 

8977
02:22:55,680 --> 02:22:57,270
what i recommend now is a hybrid i do i
mean i have no problem is it possible to

8978
02:22:57,270 --> 02:22:57,280
mean i have no problem is it possible to
 

8979
02:22:57,280 --> 02:22:59,910
mean i have no problem is it possible to
use oh it is it is what i like build the

8980
02:22:59,910 --> 02:22:59,920
use oh it is it is what i like build the
 

8981
02:22:59,920 --> 02:23:01,750
use oh it is it is what i like build the
environment with pip with conda build an

8982
02:23:01,750 --> 02:23:01,760
environment with pip with conda build an
 

8983
02:23:01,760 --> 02:23:03,190
environment with pip with conda build an
environment with conda

8984
02:23:03,190 --> 02:23:03,200
environment with conda
 

8985
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:04,469
environment with conda
and then pip install on top of that

8986
02:23:04,469 --> 02:23:04,479
and then pip install on top of that
 

8987
02:23:04,479 --> 02:23:06,389
and then pip install on top of that
that's fine be careful about pip

8988
02:23:06,389 --> 02:23:06,399
that's fine be careful about pip
 

8989
02:23:06,399 --> 02:23:07,590
that's fine be careful about pip
installing

8990
02:23:07,590 --> 02:23:07,600
installing
 

8991
02:23:07,600 --> 02:23:10,070
installing
opencv or tensorflow or because if

8992
02:23:10,070 --> 02:23:10,080
opencv or tensorflow or because if
 

8993
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:12,070
opencv or tensorflow or because if
somebody's allowed that it's going to be

8994
02:23:12,070 --> 02:23:12,080
somebody's allowed that it's going to be
 

8995
02:23:12,080 --> 02:23:13,750
somebody's allowed that it's going to be
most surely done in a way that can't be

8996
02:23:13,750 --> 02:23:13,760
most surely done in a way that can't be
 

8997
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:16,070
most surely done in a way that can't be
updated that easily so install like the

8998
02:23:16,070 --> 02:23:16,080
updated that easily so install like the
 

8999
02:23:16,080 --> 02:23:16,950
updated that easily so install like the
big

9000
02:23:16,950 --> 02:23:16,960
big
 

9001
02:23:16,960 --> 02:23:19,510
big
packages the infrastructure yeah

9002
02:23:19,510 --> 02:23:19,520
packages the infrastructure yeah
 

9003
02:23:19,520 --> 02:23:21,910
packages the infrastructure yeah
and then the weirdos yeah the the like

9004
02:23:21,910 --> 02:23:21,920
and then the weirdos yeah the the like
 

9005
02:23:21,920 --> 02:23:24,150
and then the weirdos yeah the the like
the weird like implementation for some

9006
02:23:24,150 --> 02:23:24,160
the weird like implementation for some
 

9007
02:23:24,160 --> 02:23:26,389
the weird like implementation for some
uh i had a there's a cool

9008
02:23:26,389 --> 02:23:26,399
uh i had a there's a cool
 

9009
02:23:26,399 --> 02:23:28,389
uh i had a there's a cool
library i used

9010
02:23:28,389 --> 02:23:28,399
library i used
 

9011
02:23:28,399 --> 02:23:29,190
library i used
that

9012
02:23:29,190 --> 02:23:29,200
that
 

9013
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:31,670
that
based on your location

9014
02:23:31,670 --> 02:23:31,680
based on your location
 

9015
02:23:31,680 --> 02:23:33,910
based on your location
and time of day and date tells you the

9016
02:23:33,910 --> 02:23:33,920
and time of day and date tells you the
 

9017
02:23:33,920 --> 02:23:37,030
and time of day and date tells you the
exact position of the sun relative

9018
02:23:37,030 --> 02:23:37,040
exact position of the sun relative
 

9019
02:23:37,040 --> 02:23:39,110
exact position of the sun relative
to the earth and it's just like a simple

9020
02:23:39,110 --> 02:23:39,120
to the earth and it's just like a simple
 

9021
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:41,270
to the earth and it's just like a simple
library but yeah it's very precise and i

9022
02:23:41,270 --> 02:23:41,280
library but yeah it's very precise and i
 

9023
02:23:41,280 --> 02:23:43,030
library but yeah it's very precise and i
was like all right but that was

9024
02:23:43,030 --> 02:23:43,040
was like all right but that was
 

9025
02:23:43,040 --> 02:23:45,510
was like all right but that was
that was uh in this episode the thing

9026
02:23:45,510 --> 02:23:45,520
that was uh in this episode the thing
 

9027
02:23:45,520 --> 02:23:47,429
that was uh in this episode the thing
they did really well is python

9028
02:23:47,429 --> 02:23:47,439
they did really well is python
 

9029
02:23:47,439 --> 02:23:49,349
they did really well is python
developers who want to get their stuff

9030
02:23:49,349 --> 02:23:49,359
developers who want to get their stuff
 

9031
02:23:49,359 --> 02:23:51,349
developers who want to get their stuff
published they you have to have a pip

9032
02:23:51,349 --> 02:23:51,359
published they you have to have a pip
 

9033
02:23:51,359 --> 02:23:54,550
published they you have to have a pip
recipe yeah right i mean even if it's

9034
02:23:54,550 --> 02:23:54,560
recipe yeah right i mean even if it's
 

9035
02:23:54,560 --> 02:23:57,030
recipe yeah right i mean even if it's
you know the challenge is there's a key

9036
02:23:57,030 --> 02:23:57,040
you know the challenge is there's a key
 

9037
02:23:57,040 --> 02:23:58,950
you know the challenge is there's a key
thing that needs to be added to pip just

9038
02:23:58,950 --> 02:23:58,960
thing that needs to be added to pip just
 

9039
02:23:58,960 --> 02:24:01,510
thing that needs to be added to pip just
simply add the pip the ability to defer

9040
02:24:01,510 --> 02:24:01,520
simply add the pip the ability to defer
 

9041
02:24:01,520 --> 02:24:03,910
simply add the pip the ability to defer
to a system package manager like because

9042
02:24:03,910 --> 02:24:03,920
to a system package manager like because
 

9043
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:05,190
to a system package manager like because
it's you know recognize you're not going

9044
02:24:05,190 --> 02:24:05,200
it's you know recognize you're not going
 

9045
02:24:05,200 --> 02:24:07,190
it's you know recognize you're not going
to solve all the dependency problem

9046
02:24:07,190 --> 02:24:07,200
to solve all the dependency problem
 

9047
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:10,550
to solve all the dependency problem
so let like give up and allow the allow

9048
02:24:10,550 --> 02:24:10,560
so let like give up and allow the allow
 

9049
02:24:10,560 --> 02:24:12,950
so let like give up and allow the allow
system packager to work that way

9050
02:24:12,950 --> 02:24:12,960
system packager to work that way
 

9051
02:24:12,960 --> 02:24:15,110
system packager to work that way
anaconda's installed and it has pip it

9052
02:24:15,110 --> 02:24:15,120
anaconda's installed and it has pip it
 

9053
02:24:15,120 --> 02:24:16,630
anaconda's installed and it has pip it
would default to conda to install this

9054
02:24:16,630 --> 02:24:16,640
would default to conda to install this
 

9055
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:18,630
would default to conda to install this
stuff but red hat rpm would default to

9056
02:24:18,630 --> 02:24:18,640
stuff but red hat rpm would default to
 

9057
02:24:18,640 --> 02:24:20,469
stuff but red hat rpm would default to
rpm to install but it's all more things

9058
02:24:20,469 --> 02:24:20,479
rpm to install but it's all more things
 

9059
02:24:20,479 --> 02:24:22,469
rpm to install but it's all more things
like that's the that's a key

9060
02:24:22,469 --> 02:24:22,479
like that's the that's a key
 

9061
02:24:22,479 --> 02:24:24,150
like that's the that's a key
not difficult but somewhat where some

9062
02:24:24,150 --> 02:24:24,160
not difficult but somewhat where some
 

9063
02:24:24,160 --> 02:24:26,070
not difficult but somewhat where some
work feature needs to be added that's an

9064
02:24:26,070 --> 02:24:26,080
work feature needs to be added that's an
 

9065
02:24:26,080 --> 02:24:27,750
work feature needs to be added that's an
example of something like i've known we

9066
02:24:27,750 --> 02:24:27,760
example of something like i've known we
 

9067
02:24:27,760 --> 02:24:30,150
example of something like i've known we
need to do it i mean it's where i wish i

9068
02:24:30,150 --> 02:24:30,160
need to do it i mean it's where i wish i
 

9069
02:24:30,160 --> 02:24:31,510
need to do it i mean it's where i wish i
had more money i wish i was more

9070
02:24:31,510 --> 02:24:31,520
had more money i wish i was more
 

9071
02:24:31,520 --> 02:24:33,349
had more money i wish i was more
successful in the in the business side

that i know was larger was larger and

9078
02:24:38,309 --> 02:24:38,319
that i know was larger was larger and
 

9079
02:24:38,319 --> 02:24:40,630
that i know was larger was larger and
had more money because i know tons of

02:24:40,630 --> 02:24:40,640
had more money because i know tons of
 

9081
02:24:40,640 --> 02:24:43,110
had more money because i know tons of
things to do effectively with more

things to do effectively with more
 

9083
02:24:43,120 --> 02:24:44,469
things to do effectively with more
resources

02:24:45,760 --> 02:24:47,590
but
you know i have not yet been successful

9088
02:24:47,590 --> 02:24:47,600
you know i have not yet been successful

happy with what we've done

9094
02:24:51,429 --> 02:24:51,439
happy with what we've done
 

9095
02:24:51,439 --> 02:24:54,630
happy with what we've done
we we've created again at quansite

9096
02:24:54,630 --> 02:24:54,640
we we've created again at quansite
 

9097
02:24:54,640 --> 02:24:56,230
we we've created again at quansite
what we created to get anaconda started

9098
02:24:56,230 --> 02:24:56,240
what we created to get anaconda started
 

9099
02:24:56,240 --> 02:24:57,590
what we created to get anaconda started
we created analytics and it kind of

9100
02:24:57,590 --> 02:24:57,600
we created analytics and it kind of
 

9101
02:24:57,600 --> 02:24:59,190
we created analytics and it kind of
started done it again with quansite

9102
02:24:59,190 --> 02:24:59,200
started done it again with quansite
 

9103
02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:00,870
started done it again with quansite
super excited by that by the way it took

9104
02:25:00,870 --> 02:25:00,880
super excited by that by the way it took
 

9105
02:25:00,880 --> 02:25:03,030
super excited by that by the way it took
three years to do it what is kwan site

9106
02:25:03,030 --> 02:25:03,040
three years to do it what is kwan site
 

9107
02:25:03,040 --> 02:25:05,110
three years to do it what is kwan site
what is its mission yeah we've talked a

9108
02:25:05,110 --> 02:25:05,120
what is its mission yeah we've talked a
 

9109
02:25:05,120 --> 02:25:06,790
what is its mission yeah we've talked a
few times about different fascinating

9110
02:25:06,790 --> 02:25:06,800
few times about different fascinating
 

9111
02:25:06,800 --> 02:25:08,710
few times about different fascinating
aspects of it but let's like big picture

9112
02:25:08,710 --> 02:25:08,720
aspects of it but let's like big picture
 

9113
02:25:08,720 --> 02:25:11,190
aspects of it but let's like big picture
what is big picture quan site kwansai is

9114
02:25:11,190 --> 02:25:11,200
what is big picture quan site kwansai is
 

9115
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:13,590
what is big picture quan site kwansai is
uh it's mission is to connect data to an

9116

tesla's dojo chip i'm hoping we'll have
a chance to work on that perhaps

9274
02:27:41,349 --> 02:27:41,359
a chance to work on that perhaps
 

9275
02:27:41,359 --> 02:27:42,150
a chance to work on that perhaps
um

9276
02:27:42,150 --> 02:27:42,160
um
 

9277
02:27:42,160 --> 02:27:43,590
um
things like that are definitely driving

9278
02:27:43,590 --> 02:27:43,600
things like that are definitely driving
 

9279
02:27:43,600 --> 02:27:44,630
things like that are definitely driving
it the other thing is driving is

9280
02:27:44,630 --> 02:27:44,640
it the other thing is driving is
 

9281
02:27:44,640 --> 02:27:47,110
it the other thing is driving is
scalable like speed and scale

9282
02:27:47,110 --> 02:27:47,120
scalable like speed and scale
 

9283
02:27:47,120 --> 02:27:49,510
scalable like speed and scale
uh how do i write numpy code or numpy

9284
02:27:49,510 --> 02:27:49,520
uh how do i write numpy code or numpy
 

9285
02:27:49,520 --> 02:27:51,270
uh how do i write numpy code or numpy
like code if i want it to run across a

9286
02:27:51,270 --> 02:27:51,280
like code if i want it to run across a
 

9287
02:27:51,280 --> 02:27:53,510
like code if i want it to run across a
cluster you know that's das or maybe

9288
02:27:53,510 --> 02:27:53,520
cluster you know that's das or maybe
 

9289
02:27:53,520 --> 02:27:55,190
cluster you know that's das or maybe
it's ray i mean there's sort of ways to

9290
02:27:55,190 --> 02:27:55,200
it's ray i mean there's sort of ways to
 

9291
02:27:55,200 --> 02:27:58,230
it's ray i mean there's sort of ways to
do that now or there's moden and there's

9292
02:27:58,230 --> 02:27:58,240
do that now or there's moden and there's
 

9293
02:27:58,240 --> 02:28:00,790
do that now or there's moden and there's
so pandas code numpy code sci-fi code

9294
02:28:00,790 --> 02:28:00,800
so pandas code numpy code sci-fi code
 

9295
02:28:00,800 --> 02:28:03,030
so pandas code numpy code sci-fi code
second learn code that i want to scale

9296
02:28:03,030 --> 02:28:03,040
second learn code that i want to scale
 

9297
02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:05,270
second learn code that i want to scale
so that's one big area have you gotten a

9298
02:28:05,270 --> 02:28:05,280
so that's one big area have you gotten a
 

9299
02:28:05,280 --> 02:28:08,630
so that's one big area have you gotten a
chance to chat with andre and elon about

9300
02:28:08,630 --> 02:28:08,640
chance to chat with andre and elon about
 

9301

just
how it integrates with their business i

9372
02:29:21,670 --> 02:29:21,680
how it integrates with their business i
 

9373
02:29:21,680 --> 02:29:22,790
how it integrates with their business i
mean like i said there's a lot of

9374
02:29:22,790 --> 02:29:22,800
mean like i said there's a lot of
 

9375
02:29:22,800 --> 02:29:25,030
mean like i said there's a lot of
reasons just the timing the integration

9376
02:29:25,030 --> 02:29:25,040
reasons just the timing the integration
 

9377
02:29:25,040 --> 02:29:26,230
reasons just the timing the integration
with their business what they're looking

9378
02:29:26,230 --> 02:29:26,240
with their business what they're looking
 

9379
02:29:26,240 --> 02:29:27,910
with their business what they're looking
for they're probably looking for more

9380
02:29:27,910 --> 02:29:27,920
for they're probably looking for more
 

9381
02:29:27,920 --> 02:29:30,389
for they're probably looking for more
users and i was looking to kind of have

9382
02:29:30,389 --> 02:29:30,399
users and i was looking to kind of have
 

9383
02:29:30,399 --> 02:29:31,830
users and i was looking to kind of have
some development effort and they

9384
02:29:31,830 --> 02:29:31,840
some development effort and they
 

9385
02:29:31,840 --> 02:29:33,750
some development effort and they
couldn't receive that as easily i think

9386
02:29:33,750 --> 02:29:33,760
couldn't receive that as easily i think
 

9387
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:35,990
couldn't receive that as easily i think
so i'm hoping i'm really hopeful uh and

9388
02:29:35,990 --> 02:29:36,000
so i'm hoping i'm really hopeful uh and
 

9389
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:37,510
so i'm hoping i'm really hopeful uh and
love love the people there

what's the idea behind open teams so

9392
02:29:39,830 --> 02:29:39,840
what's the idea behind open teams so
 

9393
02:29:39,840 --> 02:29:41,590
what's the idea behind open teams so
open teams i'm super excited about open

9394
02:29:41,590 --> 02:29:41,600
open teams i'm super excited about open
 

9395
02:29:41,600 --> 02:29:43,349
open teams i'm super excited about open
teams because it's one of the

9396
02:29:43,349 --> 02:29:43,359
teams because it's one of the
 

9397
02:29:43,359 --> 02:29:45,190
teams because it's one of the
i mentioned my idea for investing

9398
02:29:45,190 --> 02:29:45,200
i mentioned my idea for investing
 

9399
02:29:45,200 --> 02:29:47,030
i mentioned my idea for investing
directly in open source so that's a

9400
02:29:47,030 --> 02:29:47,040
directly in open source so that's a
 

9401
02:29:47,040 --> 02:29:49,190
directly in open source so that's a
concept called ferro ss but one of the

9402
02:29:49,190 --> 02:29:49,200
concept called ferro ss but one of the
 

9403
02:29:49,200 --> 02:29:51,030
concept called ferro ss but one of the
things we when we started quansite we

9404
02:29:51,030 --> 02:29:51,040
things we when we started quansite we
 

9405
02:29:51,040 --> 02:29:52,710
things we when we started quansite we
knew we would do is we developed

9406
02:29:52,710 --> 02:29:52,720
knew we would do is we developed
 

9407
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:54,150
knew we would do is we developed
products and ideas and new companies

9408
02:29:54,150 --> 02:29:54,160
products and ideas and new companies
 

9409
02:29:54,160 --> 02:29:56,469
products and ideas and new companies
might come out at anaconda this was

9410
02:29:56,469 --> 02:29:56,479
might come out at anaconda this was
 

9411
02:29:56,479 --> 02:29:59,110
might come out at anaconda this was
clear right anaconda we did so much

9412
02:29:59,110 --> 02:29:59,120
clear right anaconda we did so much
 

9413
02:29:59,120 --> 02:30:01,270
clear right anaconda we did so much
innovation that like five or six

9414
02:30:01,270 --> 02:30:01,280
innovation that like five or six
 

9415
02:30:01,280 --> 02:30:02,870
innovation that like five or six
companies could have come out of that

9416
02:30:02,870 --> 02:30:02,880
companies could have come out of that
 

9417
02:30:02,880 --> 02:30:04,469
companies could have come out of that
and we just didn't structure it so they

9418
02:30:04,469 --> 02:30:04,479
and we just didn't structure it so they
 

9419
02:30:04,479 --> 02:30:06,230
and we just didn't structure it so they
could but in fact they have you look at

9420
02:30:06,230 --> 02:30:06,240
could but in fact they have you look at
 

9421
02:30:06,240 --> 02:30:07,030
could but in fact they have you look at
das

9422
02:30:07,030 --> 02:30:07,040
das
 

9423
02:30:07,040 --> 02:30:08,710

you know bokeh could be a company

9426
02:30:09,910 --> 02:30:09,920
you know bokeh could be a company
 

9427
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:11,030

there's like lots of companies that

9428
02:30:11,030 --> 02:30:11,040
there's like lots of companies that
 

9429
02:30:11,040 --> 02:30:12,950
there's like lots of companies that
could exist off the work we did there

9430
02:30:12,950 --> 02:30:12,960
could exist off the work we did there
 

9431
02:30:12,960 --> 02:30:14,710
could exist off the work we did there
and so i thought oh here's a recipe for

9432
02:30:14,710 --> 02:30:14,720
and so i thought oh here's a recipe for
 

9433
02:30:14,720 --> 02:30:16,309
and so i thought oh here's a recipe for
an incubation

9434
02:30:16,309 --> 02:30:16,319
an incubation
 

9435
02:30:16,319 --> 02:30:18,550
an incubation
a concept that we could actually spawn

9436
02:30:18,550 --> 02:30:18,560
a concept that we could actually spawn
 

9437
02:30:18,560 --> 02:30:20,630
a concept that we could actually spawn
new companies and new new innovations

9438
02:30:20,630 --> 02:30:20,640
new companies and new new innovations
 

9439
02:30:20,640 --> 02:30:22,630
new companies and new new innovations
then the idea has always been

9440
02:30:22,630 --> 02:30:22,640
then the idea has always been
 

9441
02:30:22,640 --> 02:30:24,710
then the idea has always been
well money they earn should come back to

9442
02:30:24,710 --> 02:30:24,720
well money they earn should come back to
 

9443
02:30:24,720 --> 02:30:27,990
well money they earn should come back to
fund the open source project so so labs

9444
02:30:27,990 --> 02:30:28,000
fund the open source project so so labs
 

9445
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:29,190
fund the open source project so so labs
is you know i think there should be a

9446
02:30:29,190 --> 02:30:29,200
is you know i think there should be a
 

9447
02:30:29,200 --> 02:30:30,870
is you know i think there should be a
lot of things like quansite labs i think

9448
02:30:30,870 --> 02:30:30,880
lot of things like quansite labs i think
 

9449
02:30:30,880 --> 02:30:32,469

along the way so in 2018 when the bigger
 

9457
02:30:36,880 --> 02:30:37,990
along the way so in 2018 when the bigger
idea came how to make open source

9458
02:30:37,990 --> 02:30:38,000
idea came how to make open source
 

9459

enterprise software
um it's we're still early like this idea

9834
02:36:05,349 --> 02:36:05,359
um it's we're still early like this idea
 

9835
02:36:05,359 --> 02:36:07,349
um it's we're still early like this idea
just percolated over the past year as

9836
02:36:07,349 --> 02:36:07,359
just percolated over the past year as
 

9837
02:36:07,359 --> 02:36:08,389
just percolated over the past year as
we've kind of grown quan sight and

9838
02:36:08,389 --> 02:36:08,399
we've kind of grown quan sight and
 

9839
02:36:08,399 --> 02:36:10,389
we've kind of grown quan sight and
realize the extensibility of it uh we

9840
02:36:10,389 --> 02:36:10,399
realize the extensibility of it uh we
 

9841
02:36:10,399 --> 02:36:12,710
realize the extensibility of it uh we
just finished in our seed round uh the

9842
02:36:12,710 --> 02:36:12,720
just finished in our seed round uh the
 

9843
02:36:12,720 --> 02:36:14,469
just finished in our seed round uh the
work to help you know get more sales

9844
02:36:14,469 --> 02:36:14,479
work to help you know get more sales
 

9845
02:36:14,479 --> 02:36:16,469
work to help you know get more sales
people and then push the push the

9846
02:36:16,469 --> 02:36:16,479
people and then push the push the
 

9847
02:36:16,479 --> 02:36:18,309
people and then push the push the
messaging correctly and there's lots of

messaging correctly and there's lots of
 

9849
02:36:18,319 --> 02:36:19,670
messaging correctly and there's lots of
tools we're building to make this easier

9850
02:36:19,670 --> 02:36:19,680
tools we're building to make this easier
 

9851
02:36:19,680 --> 02:36:21,510
tools we're building to make this easier
like we want to automate the processes

9852
02:36:21,510 --> 02:36:21,520
like we want to automate the processes
 

9853
02:36:21,520 --> 02:36:23,750
like we want to automate the processes
we feel like a lot of the power is the

9854
02:36:23,750 --> 02:36:23,760
we feel like a lot of the power is the
 

9855
02:36:23,760 --> 02:36:25,670
we feel like a lot of the power is the
efficiency of the sales process there's

9856
02:36:25,670 --> 02:36:25,680
efficiency of the sales process there's
 

9857
02:36:25,680 --> 02:36:27,429
efficiency of the sales process there's
a lot of wasted energy

9858
02:36:27,429 --> 02:36:27,439
a lot of wasted energy
 

9859
02:36:27,439 --> 02:36:29,270
a lot of wasted energy
in small teams

9860
02:36:29,270 --> 02:36:29,280
in small teams
 

9861
02:36:29,280 --> 02:36:31,110
in small teams
and the sales energy to get into large

9862
02:36:31,110 --> 02:36:31,120
and the sales energy to get into large
 

9863
02:36:31,120 --> 02:36:32,950
and the sales energy to get into large
companies and make a deal there's a lot

9864
02:36:32,950 --> 02:36:32,960
companies and make a deal there's a lot
 

9865
02:36:32,960 --> 02:36:34,870
companies and make a deal there's a lot
of money spent on that stuff creating

9866
02:36:34,870 --> 02:36:34,880
of money spent on that stuff creating
 

9867
02:36:34,880 --> 02:36:36,469
of money spent on that stuff creating
the tools and processes

9868
02:36:36,469 --> 02:36:36,479
the tools and processes
 

9869
02:36:36,479 --> 02:36:38,790
the tools and processes
makes that super seamless so a single

9870
02:36:38,790 --> 02:36:38,800
makes that super seamless so a single
 

9871

good meme about how he approached that
 

9931
02:37:32,399 --> 02:37:33,429
good meme about how he approached that
but

9932

but
 

9933
02:37:33,439 --> 02:37:34,790
but

are they just basically throwing money
 

9945
02:37:45,760 --> 02:37:47,990
are they just basically throwing money
at developers to show their support i

9946
02:37:47,990 --> 02:37:48,000
at developers to show their support i
 

9947
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,389
at developers to show their support i
think so without uh a topology like you

9948
02:37:50,389 --> 02:37:50,399
think so without uh a topology like you
 

9949
02:37:50,399 --> 02:37:53,110
think so without uh a topology like you
put it like a a a way to leverage that

9950
02:37:53,110 --> 02:37:53,120
put it like a a a way to leverage that
 

9951
02:37:53,120 --> 02:37:55,349
put it like a a a way to leverage that
like to give developers actual money

02:39:28,880 --> 02:39:30,710
to take on tesla and autopilot you want
to take that right and so

10056
02:39:30,710 --> 02:39:30,720
to take that right and so
 

10057
02:39:30,720 --> 02:39:32,230
to take that right and so
what do you do there you show that

10058
02:39:32,230 --> 02:39:32,240
what do you do there you show that
 

10059
02:39:32,240 --> 02:39:34,230
what do you do there you show that
you're cool like you sh you try to show

10060
02:39:34,230 --> 02:39:34,240
you're cool like you sh you try to show
 

10061
02:39:34,240 --> 02:39:36,550
you're cool like you sh you try to show
off that you care about developers and

10062
02:39:36,550 --> 02:39:36,560
off that you care about developers and
 

10063
02:39:36,560 --> 02:39:39,030
off that you care about developers and
they have a lot of trouble doing that

10064
02:39:39,030 --> 02:39:39,040
they have a lot of trouble doing that
 

10065
02:39:39,040 --> 02:39:41,110
they have a lot of trouble doing that
and like one way i think like ford

10066
02:39:41,110 --> 02:39:41,120
and like one way i think like ford
 

10067
02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:43,349
and like one way i think like ford
should have bought github they just to

10068
02:39:43,349 --> 02:39:43,359
should have bought github they just to
 

10069
02:39:43,359 --> 02:39:45,910
should have bought github they just to
show off better yeah yeah like these old

10070
02:39:45,910 --> 02:39:45,920
show off better yeah yeah like these old
 

10071
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:47,590
show off better yeah yeah like these old
school companies and it's in a lot of

10076
02:39:51,110 --> 02:39:51,120
there's probably different ways it's
 

10077
02:39:51,120 --> 02:39:52,550
there's probably different ways it's
probably an article

10078
02:39:52,550 --> 02:39:52,560
probably an article
 

10079
02:39:52,560 --> 02:39:54,469
probably an article
that you care to developers and the

10080

just spitballing here but like ford or
 

10089
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:04,389
just spitballing here but like ford or
somebody like that could give

10090
02:40:04,389 --> 02:40:04,399
somebody like that could give
 

10091
02:40:04,399 --> 02:40:06,070
somebody like that could give
a hundred million dollars to the

10092

a hundred million dollars to the
 

10093

anaconda one was num focus right and
 

10129
02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:42,710
anaconda one was num focus right and
they were both important efforts they

10130

challenge is not dissimilar from the
 

10195
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,630
challenge is not dissimilar from the
challenge you have in academia at the

10196

challenge you have in academia at the
 

10197

very specific and very channeled right
 

10201
02:41:49,840 --> 02:41:51,590
very specific and very channeled right

02:43:10,160 --> 02:43:12,469
and they're just repeating that over and
over as opposed to innovating like

10286
02:43:12,469 --> 02:43:12,479
over as opposed to innovating like

raw authenticity of what it takes to
 

10405
02:45:06,800 --> 02:45:08,870
raw authenticity of what it takes to
build that system versus uh the

but two there's an authenticity to that
 

10429
02:45:31,920 --> 02:45:33,590
but two there's an authenticity to that
kind of communication that's really

10430
02:45:33,590 --> 02:45:33,600
kind of communication that's really
 

10431

kind of communication that's really
inspiring to the end user as well like

inspiring to the end user as well like
if they know that brilliant people the

10434
02:45:38,469 --> 02:45:38,479
if they know that brilliant people the
 

10435

know my wife bought a rumba rumba but
she and she you know loves developers

10450
02:45:51,910 --> 02:45:51,920
she and she you know loves developers
 

10451
02:45:51,920 --> 02:45:53,670
she and she you know loves developers
she loves me but she doesn't

10452

care about
that yeah

10456
02:45:56,389 --> 02:45:56,399
that yeah
 

10457
02:45:56,399 --> 02:45:58,550
that yeah
so essentially what you said is actually

10458
02:45:58,550 --> 02:45:58,560
so essentially what you said is actually
 

10459
02:45:58,560 --> 02:46:00,070
so essentially what you said is actually
the authenticity because everyone has a

10460
02:46:00,070 --> 02:46:00,080
the authenticity because everyone has a
 

10461
02:46:00,080 --> 02:46:01,110
the authenticity because everyone has a
friend everyone knows people there's

10462
02:46:01,110 --> 02:46:01,120
friend everyone knows people there's
 

10463
02:46:01,120 --> 02:46:02,870
friend everyone knows people there's
word of mouth i mean if you worded my

10464
02:46:02,870 --> 02:46:02,880
word of mouth i mean if you worded my
 

10465
02:46:02,880 --> 02:46:05,429
word of mouth i mean if you worded my
mouth is so so yeah exactly

because i think it's the lack of that
 

10469
02:46:06,640 --> 02:46:08,070
because i think it's the lack of that
that realization there's this halo

10470
02:46:08,070 --> 02:46:08,080
that realization there's this halo
 

10471
02:46:08,080 --> 02:46:09,910
that realization there's this halo

it seems that the reason i have a
 

10479
02:46:16,399 --> 02:46:18,710
it seems that the reason i have a
platform many others like me millions of

could be benefiting from a from a
 

10503
02:46:43,120 --> 02:46:44,950
could be benefiting from a from a
culture of modern modularity like

10504
02:46:44,950 --> 02:46:44,960
culture of modern modularity like
 

10505
02:46:44,960 --> 02:46:46,469
culture of modern modularity like
add-ons and right like that could

10506

10517
02:46:55,439 --> 02:46:56,710
point is is that you have something that
needs to be

10518
02:46:56,710 --> 02:46:56,720
needs to be
 

10519
02:46:56,720 --> 02:46:58,230
needs to be
it needs to be adopted broadly the

10520
02:46:58,230 --> 02:46:58,240
it needs to be adopted broadly the
 

10521
02:46:58,240 --> 02:46:59,990
it needs to be adopted broadly the
concept needs to be adopted broadly and

10522
02:46:59,990 --> 02:47:00,000
concept needs to be adopted broadly and
 

10523
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:01,510
concept needs to be adopted broadly and
if you want to go beyond this one device

10524
02:47:01,510 --> 02:47:01,520
if you want to go beyond this one device
 

10525
02:47:01,520 --> 02:47:02,469
if you want to go beyond this one device
you need

10526
02:47:02,469 --> 02:47:02,479
you need
 

10527
02:47:02,479 --> 02:47:05,190
you need
to engage this community yeah and

10528
02:47:05,190 --> 02:47:05,200
to engage this community yeah and
 

10529
02:47:05,200 --> 02:47:07,030
to engage this community yeah and
connecting to the the open source as you

10530
02:47:07,030 --> 02:47:07,040
connecting to the the open source as you
 

10531
02:47:07,040 --> 02:47:09,910
connecting to the the open source as you
said i got to ask you

10532
02:47:09,910 --> 02:47:09,920
said i got to ask you
 

10533
02:47:09,920 --> 02:47:11,590
said i got to ask you
your programmer

10534
02:47:11,590 --> 02:47:11,600
your programmer
 

10535
02:47:11,600 --> 02:47:13,910
your programmer
uh one of the most impactful programmers

10536
02:47:13,910 --> 02:47:13,920
uh one of the most impactful programmers
 

10537
02:47:13,920 --> 02:47:14,790
uh one of the most impactful programmers
ever

10538
02:47:14,790 --> 02:47:14,800
ever
 

10539
02:47:14,800 --> 02:47:16,630
ever
you've led many programmers you lead

10540
02:47:16,630 --> 02:47:16,640
you've led many programmers you lead
 

10541
02:47:16,640 --> 02:47:18,550
you've led many programmers you lead
many programmers

10542
02:47:18,550 --> 02:47:18,560
many programmers
 

10543
02:47:18,560 --> 02:47:20,150
many programmers
what are some from a programmer

10544
02:47:20,150 --> 02:47:20,160
what are some from a programmer
 

10545
02:47:20,160 --> 02:47:21,349
what are some from a programmer
perspective

10546
02:47:21,349 --> 02:47:21,359
perspective
 

10547
02:47:21,359 --> 02:47:23,590
perspective
what makes a good programmer what makes

10548
02:47:23,590 --> 02:47:23,600
what makes a good programmer what makes
 

10549
02:47:23,600 --> 02:47:25,590
what makes a good programmer what makes
a productive programmer is there a

10550
02:47:25,590 --> 02:47:25,600
a productive programmer is there a
 

10551
02:47:25,600 --> 02:47:27,910
a productive programmer is there a
device you can give to be a great

10552
02:47:27,910 --> 02:47:27,920
device you can give to be a great
 

10553
02:47:27,920 --> 02:47:30,630
device you can give to be a great
programmer great great question and

10554
02:47:30,630 --> 02:47:30,640
programmer great great question and
 

10555
02:47:30,640 --> 02:47:31,830
programmer great great question and
there are times in my life i'd probably

10556
02:47:31,830 --> 02:47:31,840
there are times in my life i'd probably
 

10557
02:47:31,840 --> 02:47:33,190
there are times in my life i'd probably
answer this even better than i hope

10558
02:47:33,190 --> 02:47:33,200
answer this even better than i hope
 

10559
02:47:33,200 --> 02:47:35,110
answer this even better than i hope
maybe give an answer today because i've

10560
02:47:35,110 --> 02:47:35,120
maybe give an answer today because i've
 

10561
02:47:35,120 --> 02:47:36,550
maybe give an answer today because i've
thought about this at numerous times

10562
02:47:36,550 --> 02:47:36,560
thought about this at numerous times
 

10563
02:47:36,560 --> 02:47:37,910
thought about this at numerous times
like right now i've spent on so much

10564
02:47:37,910 --> 02:47:37,920
like right now i've spent on so much
 

10565
02:47:37,920 --> 02:47:41,030
like right now i've spent on so much
time recently hiring sales people that

10566
02:47:41,030 --> 02:47:41,040
time recently hiring sales people that
 

10567
02:47:41,040 --> 02:47:42,710
time recently hiring sales people that
your mind is like

10568
02:47:42,710 --> 02:47:42,720
your mind is like
 

10569
02:47:42,720 --> 02:47:45,030
your mind is like
something else on something else but i i

10570
02:47:45,030 --> 02:47:45,040
something else on something else but i i
 

10571
02:47:45,040 --> 02:47:47,190
something else on something else but i i
reflected on the past and also uh you

10572
02:47:47,190 --> 02:47:47,200
reflected on the past and also uh you
 

10573
02:47:47,200 --> 02:47:48,469
reflected on the past and also uh you
know i have some really the only way i

10574
02:47:48,469 --> 02:47:48,479
know i have some really the only way i
 

10575
02:47:48,479 --> 02:47:49,990
know i have some really the only way i
can do this i have some really great

10576
02:47:49,990 --> 02:47:50,000
can do this i have some really great
 

10577
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:51,750
can do this i have some really great
programmers that i work with who lead

10578
02:47:51,750 --> 02:47:51,760
programmers that i work with who lead
 

10579
02:47:51,760 --> 02:47:53,590
programmers that i work with who lead
the teams that they they lead and my

10580
02:47:53,590 --> 02:47:53,600
the teams that they they lead and my
 

10581
02:47:53,600 --> 02:47:55,190
the teams that they they lead and my
goal is to inspire them and and

10582
02:47:55,190 --> 02:47:55,200
goal is to inspire them and and
 

10583
02:47:55,200 --> 02:47:57,190
goal is to inspire them and and
hopefully help them encourage them and

10584
02:47:57,190 --> 02:47:57,200
hopefully help them encourage them and
 

10585
02:47:57,200 --> 02:47:58,630
hopefully help them encourage them and
be uh help them encourage with their

10586
02:47:58,630 --> 02:47:58,640
be uh help them encourage with their
 

10587
02:47:58,640 --> 02:48:00,309
be uh help them encourage with their
teams i would say there's a number of

10588
02:48:00,309 --> 02:48:00,319
teams i would say there's a number of
 

10589
02:48:00,319 --> 02:48:03,670
teams i would say there's a number of
things couple things one is um curiosity

10590
02:48:03,670 --> 02:48:03,680
things couple things one is um curiosity
 

10591
02:48:03,680 --> 02:48:05,990
things couple things one is um curiosity
like you i think a programmer without

10592
02:48:05,990 --> 02:48:06,000
like you i think a programmer without
 

10593
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:07,590
like you i think a programmer without
curiosity

10594
02:48:07,590 --> 02:48:07,600
curiosity
 

10595
02:48:07,600 --> 02:48:10,790
curiosity
is uh mundane like you'll lose interest

10596
02:48:10,790 --> 02:48:10,800
is uh mundane like you'll lose interest
 

10597
02:48:10,800 --> 02:48:12,550
is uh mundane like you'll lose interest
you don't do your best work so it's sort

10598
02:48:12,550 --> 02:48:12,560
you don't do your best work so it's sort
 

10599
02:48:12,560 --> 02:48:14,309
you don't do your best work so it's sort
of it's an affect it's sort of are you

10600
02:48:14,309 --> 02:48:14,319
of it's an affect it's sort of are you
 

10601
02:48:14,319 --> 02:48:16,630
of it's an affect it's sort of are you
you have some curiosity about things

10602
02:48:16,630 --> 02:48:16,640
you have some curiosity about things
 

10603
02:48:16,640 --> 02:48:19,110
you have some curiosity about things
i think two don't try to do everything

10604
02:48:19,110 --> 02:48:19,120
i think two don't try to do everything
 

10605
02:48:19,120 --> 02:48:20,710
i think two don't try to do everything
at once recognize that you're you know

10606
02:48:20,710 --> 02:48:20,720
at once recognize that you're you know
 

10607
02:48:20,720 --> 02:48:22,309
at once recognize that you're you know
we're limited as humans you're limited

10608
02:48:22,309 --> 02:48:22,319
we're limited as humans you're limited
 

10609
02:48:22,319 --> 02:48:23,750
we're limited as humans you're limited
as a human and each one of us are

10610
02:48:23,750 --> 02:48:23,760
as a human and each one of us are
 

10611
02:48:23,760 --> 02:48:25,190
as a human and each one of us are
limited in different ways you know we

10612
02:48:25,190 --> 02:48:25,200
limited in different ways you know we
 

10613
02:48:25,200 --> 02:48:26,150
limited in different ways you know we
all have our different strengths and

10614
02:48:26,150 --> 02:48:26,160
all have our different strengths and
 

10615
02:48:26,160 --> 02:48:28,150
all have our different strengths and
skills so it's adapting the art of

10616
02:48:28,150 --> 02:48:28,160
skills so it's adapting the art of
 

10617
02:48:28,160 --> 02:48:29,910
skills so it's adapting the art of
programming to your skills one of the

10618
02:48:29,910 --> 02:48:29,920
programming to your skills one of the
 

10619
02:48:29,920 --> 02:48:31,830
programming to your skills one of the
things that always works is to limit

10620
02:48:31,830 --> 02:48:31,840
things that always works is to limit
 

10621
02:48:31,840 --> 02:48:33,510
things that always works is to limit
what you're trying to solve

10622
02:48:33,510 --> 02:48:33,520
what you're trying to solve
 

10623
02:48:33,520 --> 02:48:35,590
what you're trying to solve
right so um

10624
02:48:35,590 --> 02:48:35,600
right so um
 

10625
02:48:35,600 --> 02:48:37,110
right so um
if you're part of a team usually maybe

10626
02:48:37,110 --> 02:48:37,120
if you're part of a team usually maybe
 

10627
02:48:37,120 --> 02:48:38,469
if you're part of a team usually maybe
somebody else has put the architecture

10628
02:48:38,469 --> 02:48:38,479
somebody else has put the architecture
 

10629
02:48:38,479 --> 02:48:39,670
somebody else has put the architecture
together and they've gotten given a

10630
02:48:39,670 --> 02:48:39,680
together and they've gotten given a
 

10631
02:48:39,680 --> 02:48:41,670
together and they've gotten given a
portion for you if you if you're young

10632
02:48:41,670 --> 02:48:41,680
portion for you if you if you're young
 

10633
02:48:41,680 --> 02:48:44,230
portion for you if you if you're young
if you're not part of a team is sort of

10634
02:48:44,230 --> 02:48:44,240
if you're not part of a team is sort of
 

10635
02:48:44,240 --> 02:48:45,830
if you're not part of a team is sort of
breaking down the problem into smaller

10636
02:48:45,830 --> 02:48:45,840
breaking down the problem into smaller
 

10637
02:48:45,840 --> 02:48:47,750
breaking down the problem into smaller
parts is essential for you to make

10638
02:48:47,750 --> 02:48:47,760
parts is essential for you to make
 

10639
02:48:47,760 --> 02:48:50,150
parts is essential for you to make
progress it's very easy to take on a big

10640
02:48:50,150 --> 02:48:50,160
progress it's very easy to take on a big
 

10641
02:48:50,160 --> 02:48:51,990
progress it's very easy to take on a big
project and try to do it all at once and

10642
02:48:51,990 --> 02:48:52,000
project and try to do it all at once and
 

10643
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:53,590
project and try to do it all at once and
you get lost and then you do it badly

10644
02:48:53,590 --> 02:48:53,600
you get lost and then you do it badly
 

10645
02:48:53,600 --> 02:48:55,349
you get lost and then you do it badly
and so

10646
02:48:55,349 --> 02:48:55,359
and so
 

10647
02:48:55,359 --> 02:48:58,070
and so
thinking about you know um very

10648
02:48:58,070 --> 02:48:58,080
thinking about you know um very
 

10649
02:48:58,080 --> 02:48:59,830
thinking about you know um very
concretely what you're doing to find you

10650
02:48:59,830 --> 02:48:59,840
concretely what you're doing to find you
 

10651
02:48:59,840 --> 02:49:01,510
concretely what you're doing to find you
know defining the inputs and outputs to

10652
02:49:01,510 --> 02:49:01,520
know defining the inputs and outputs to
 

10653
02:49:01,520 --> 02:49:03,190
know defining the inputs and outputs to
finding what you want to get done

10654
02:49:03,190 --> 02:49:03,200
finding what you want to get done
 

10655
02:49:03,200 --> 02:49:05,910
finding what you want to get done
um even just talking about that in like

10656
02:49:05,910 --> 02:49:05,920
um even just talking about that in like
 

10657
02:49:05,920 --> 02:49:07,110
um even just talking about that in like
writing down

10658
02:49:07,110 --> 02:49:07,120
writing down
 

10659
02:49:07,120 --> 02:49:08,469
writing down
before you write code just what are you

10660
02:49:08,469 --> 02:49:08,479
before you write code just what are you
 

10661
02:49:08,479 --> 02:49:09,990
before you write code just what are you
trying to accomplish and being very

10662
02:49:09,990 --> 02:49:10,000
trying to accomplish and being very
 

10663
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:11,510
trying to accomplish and being very
specific about it

10664
02:49:11,510 --> 02:49:11,520
specific about it
 

10665
02:49:11,520 --> 02:49:13,990
specific about it
uh really really helps i think um

10666
02:49:13,990 --> 02:49:14,000
uh really really helps i think um
 

10667
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:15,990
uh really really helps i think um
using other people's work

10668
02:49:15,990 --> 02:49:16,000
using other people's work
 

10669
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:16,870
using other people's work
right

10670
02:49:16,870 --> 02:49:16,880
right
 

10671
02:49:16,880 --> 02:49:19,030
right

that's particularly relevant in the era
 

10685
02:49:31,040 --> 02:49:33,190
that's particularly relevant in the era
of codex and the uh you know the

of codex and the uh you know the
 

10687
02:49:33,200 --> 02:49:34,870
of codex and the uh you know the
auto-generated code which is essentially

i see as an indexing of stack overflow
 

10691
02:49:36,720 --> 02:49:38,550
i see as an indexing of stack overflow
right exactly secondly it's like it's a

right exactly secondly it's like it's a

but not blindly like
 

10703
02:49:48,399 --> 02:49:49,910
but not blindly like
absolutely i've cut and paste to

10781
02:51:04,240 --> 02:51:06,389
afraid you're the first thing you do is
probably going to suck and that's okay

10782
02:51:06,389 --> 02:51:06,399
probably going to suck and that's okay
 

10783
02:51:06,399 --> 02:51:07,590

right

10784
02:51:07,590 --> 02:51:07,600
right
 

10785
02:51:07,600 --> 02:51:09,590
right
it's it's honestly i think iteration is

10786
02:51:09,590 --> 02:51:09,600
it's it's honestly i think iteration is
 

10787
02:51:09,600 --> 02:51:11,110
it's it's honestly i think iteration is
the key to innovation

10788
02:51:11,110 --> 02:51:11,120
the key to innovation
 

10789
02:51:11,120 --> 02:51:13,030
the key to innovation
and and it's that it's almost that

10790
02:51:13,030 --> 02:51:13,040
and and it's that it's almost that
 

10791
02:51:13,040 --> 02:51:15,269
and and it's that it's almost that
psychological um

10792
02:51:15,269 --> 02:51:15,279
psychological um
 

10793
02:51:15,279 --> 02:51:17,590
psychological um
hesitation we have to just

10794
02:51:17,590 --> 02:51:17,600
hesitation we have to just
 

10795
02:51:17,600 --> 02:51:19,830
hesitation we have to just
uh iterate like yeah we know you you

10796
02:51:19,830 --> 02:51:19,840
uh iterate like yeah we know you you
 

10797
02:51:19,840 --> 02:51:21,590
uh iterate like yeah we know you you
know it's not great but next i want to

10798
02:51:21,590 --> 02:51:21,600
know it's not great but next i want to
 

10799
02:51:21,600 --> 02:51:23,670
know it's not great but next i want to
be better i mean just just keep learning

10800
02:51:23,670 --> 02:51:23,680
be better i mean just just keep learning
 

10801
02:51:23,680 --> 02:51:25,750
be better i mean just just keep learning
and keep breathing and keep improving so

10802
02:51:25,750 --> 02:51:25,760
and keep breathing and keep improving so
 

10803
02:51:25,760 --> 02:51:28,469
and keep breathing and keep improving so
it's it's an attitude um and then

10804
02:51:28,469 --> 02:51:28,479
it's it's an attitude um and then
 

10805
02:51:28,479 --> 02:51:30,830
it's it's an attitude um and then
it doesn't take intense concentration

10806
02:51:30,830 --> 02:51:30,840
it doesn't take intense concentration
 

10807
02:51:30,840 --> 02:51:34,550
it doesn't take intense concentration
right good things don't happen just

10808
02:51:34,550 --> 02:51:34,560
right good things don't happen just
 

10809
02:51:34,560 --> 02:51:36,870
right good things don't happen just
it's not quite like tick tock or like

way to good programming right there are

10814
02:51:41,190 --> 02:51:41,200
way to good programming right there are
 

10815
02:51:41,200 --> 02:51:43,670
way to good programming right there are
you know sincere like hours of

10816

and you know just um five minutes not
gonna not gonna give you that was it

10832
02:51:57,110 --> 02:51:57,120
gonna not gonna give you that was it
 

10833
02:51:57,120 --> 02:51:59,670
gonna not gonna give you that was it
lonely when you were building sci-pod

10834
02:51:59,670 --> 02:51:59,680
lonely when you were building sci-pod
 

10835
02:51:59,680 --> 02:52:02,389
lonely when you were building sci-pod
and number hugely yeah absolutely lonely

10836
02:52:02,389 --> 02:52:02,399
and number hugely yeah absolutely lonely
 

10837
02:52:02,399 --> 02:52:03,910
and number hugely yeah absolutely lonely
in the sense of

10838
02:52:03,910 --> 02:52:03,920
in the sense of
 

10839
02:52:03,920 --> 02:52:05,910
in the sense of
you have to have an inner drive

10840
02:52:05,910 --> 02:52:05,920
you have to have an inner drive
 

10841
02:52:05,920 --> 02:52:07,510
you have to have an inner drive
and that inner drive for me always comes

10842
02:52:07,510 --> 02:52:07,520
and that inner drive for me always comes
 

10843
02:52:07,520 --> 02:52:09,429
and that inner drive for me always comes
from i have to i have to see that this

10844
02:52:09,429 --> 02:52:09,439
from i have to i have to see that this
 

10845
02:52:09,439 --> 02:52:10,710
from i have to i have to see that this
is right

10846
02:52:10,710 --> 02:52:10,720
is right
 

10847
02:52:10,720 --> 02:52:12,389
is right
in some angle i have to believe it that

10848
02:52:12,389 --> 02:52:12,399
in some angle i have to believe it that
 

10849
02:52:12,399 --> 02:52:13,510
in some angle i have to believe it that
this is the right approach the right

10850
02:52:13,510 --> 02:52:13,520
this is the right approach the right
 

10851
02:52:13,520 --> 02:52:14,550
this is the right approach the right
thing to do

10852
02:52:14,550 --> 02:52:14,560
thing to do
 

10853
02:52:14,560 --> 02:52:16,710
thing to do
with scipy it was like oh yeah the world

10854
02:52:16,710 --> 02:52:16,720
with scipy it was like oh yeah the world
 

10855

so that is a good in itself so i'm going

10866
02:52:26,630 --> 02:52:26,640
so that is a good in itself so i'm going
 

10867
02:52:26,640 --> 02:52:29,269
so that is a good in itself so i'm going
to go do that good so find a good find a

10868
02:52:29,269 --> 02:52:29,279
to go do that good so find a good find a
 

10869
02:52:29,279 --> 02:52:30,870
to go do that good so find a good find a
thing that you know is good and just

02:52:30,870 --> 02:52:30,880
thing that you know is good and just
 

10871
02:52:30,880 --> 02:52:33,830
thing that you know is good and just
just work on it um so that has to happen

10872
02:52:33,830 --> 02:52:33,840
just work on it um so that has to happen
 

10873
02:52:33,840 --> 02:52:35,349
just work on it um so that has to happen
and it is and you kind of have to have

10874
02:52:35,349 --> 02:52:35,359
and it is and you kind of have to have
 

10875
02:52:35,359 --> 02:52:38,150
and it is and you kind of have to have
enough realization of your mission

10876
02:52:38,150 --> 02:52:38,160
enough realization of your mission
 

10877
02:52:38,160 --> 02:52:40,550

one thing i've talked to people a lot

10882
02:52:43,349 --> 02:52:43,359
one thing i've talked to people a lot
 

10883
02:52:43,359 --> 02:52:44,630
one thing i've talked to people a lot
i've seen a lot of projects come and

10884
02:52:44,630 --> 02:52:44,640
i've seen a lot of projects come and
 

10885
02:52:44,640 --> 02:52:46,070
i've seen a lot of projects come and
some fail like not everything i've done

10886
02:52:46,070 --> 02:52:46,080
some fail like not everything i've done
 

10887
02:52:46,080 --> 02:52:48,070
some fail like not everything i've done
has actually worked perfectly i've tried

10888
02:52:48,070 --> 02:52:48,080
has actually worked perfectly i've tried
 

10889
02:52:48,080 --> 02:52:49,269
has actually worked perfectly i've tried
a bunch of stuff that okay that didn't

10890
02:52:49,269 --> 02:52:49,279
a bunch of stuff that okay that didn't
 

10891
02:52:49,279 --> 02:52:50,950
a bunch of stuff that okay that didn't
really work or this isn't working and

10892
02:52:50,950 --> 02:52:50,960
really work or this isn't working and
 

10893
02:52:50,960 --> 02:52:51,910
really work or this isn't working and
why

10894
02:52:51,910 --> 02:52:51,920
why
 

10895
02:52:51,920 --> 02:52:54,230
why
but you see the patterns and one of the

10896
02:52:54,230 --> 02:52:54,240
but you see the patterns and one of the
 

10897
02:52:54,240 --> 02:52:55,590
but you see the patterns and one of the
key things is

10898
02:52:55,590 --> 02:52:55,600
key things is
 

10899
02:52:55,600 --> 02:52:57,269
key things is
you can't even know

10900
02:52:57,269 --> 02:52:57,279
you can't even know
 

10901
02:52:57,279 --> 02:52:58,389
you can't even know
for

10902
02:52:58,389 --> 02:52:58,399
for
 

10903
02:52:58,399 --> 02:53:00,150
for
six months i say 18 months right now if

10904
02:53:00,150 --> 02:53:00,160
six months i say 18 months right now if
 

10905
02:53:00,160 --> 02:53:01,830
six months i say 18 months right now if
you're starting a new project you got to

10906
02:53:01,830 --> 02:53:01,840
you're starting a new project you got to
 

10907
02:53:01,840 --> 02:53:03,429
you're starting a new project you got to
give it a good 18 month run before you

10908
02:53:03,429 --> 02:53:03,439
give it a good 18 month run before you
 

10909
02:53:03,439 --> 02:53:05,510
give it a good 18 month run before you
even know if the feedback's there like

10910
02:53:05,510 --> 02:53:05,520
even know if the feedback's there like
 

10911
02:53:05,520 --> 02:53:07,670
even know if the feedback's there like
it's you're not gonna know in six months

10912
02:53:07,670 --> 02:53:07,680
it's you're not gonna know in six months
 

10913
02:53:07,680 --> 02:53:08,870
it's you're not gonna know in six months
you might have the perfect thing but six

10914
02:53:08,870 --> 02:53:08,880
you might have the perfect thing but six
 

10915
02:53:08,880 --> 02:53:10,389
you might have the perfect thing but six
months from now it's still kind of still

10916
02:53:10,389 --> 02:53:10,399
months from now it's still kind of still
 

10917
02:53:10,399 --> 02:53:12,389
months from now it's still kind of still
emerging so give it time because you're

10918
02:53:12,389 --> 02:53:12,399
emerging so give it time because you're
 

10919
02:53:12,399 --> 02:53:13,830
emerging so give it time because you're
dealing with humans and humans have an

so let me ask a silly question but uh

10928
02:53:21,830 --> 02:53:21,840
so let me ask a silly question but uh

like you said you're focused on the
 

10933
02:53:24,399 --> 02:53:27,190
like you said you're focused on the
sales side of things currently but

10982
02:54:12,630 --> 02:54:12,640
exactly it's kind of like but people do
 

10983
02:54:12,640 --> 02:54:14,469
exactly it's kind of like but people do
take the editor seriously they take it i

10984
02:54:14,469 --> 02:54:14,479
take the editor seriously they take it i
 

10985
02:54:14,479 --> 02:54:16,469
take the editor seriously they take it i
did it with your life

10986
02:54:16,469 --> 02:54:16,479
did it with your life
 

10987
02:54:16,479 --> 02:54:17,349
did it with your life
it is

10988
02:54:17,349 --> 02:54:17,359
it is
 

10989
02:54:17,359 --> 02:54:19,190
it is
but uh there's something there's

10990
02:54:19,190 --> 02:54:19,200
but uh there's something there's
 

10991
02:54:19,200 --> 02:54:20,630
but uh there's something there's
something beautiful to me about emacs

10992
02:54:20,630 --> 02:54:20,640
something beautiful to me about emacs
 

10993
02:54:20,640 --> 02:54:22,230
something beautiful to me about emacs
but there's for people that love them

10994
02:54:22,230 --> 02:54:22,240
but there's for people that love them
 

10995
02:54:22,240 --> 02:54:23,670
but there's for people that love them
there's something beautiful to them i

10996
02:54:23,670 --> 02:54:23,680
there's something beautiful to them i
 

10997
02:54:23,680 --> 02:54:26,070
there's something beautiful to them i
mean i do use them for quick editing

10998
02:54:26,070 --> 02:54:26,080
mean i do use them for quick editing
 

10999
02:54:26,080 --> 02:54:27,750
mean i do use them for quick editing
like command line if i say quick editing

11000
02:54:27,750 --> 02:54:27,760
like command line if i say quick editing
 

11001
02:54:27,760 --> 02:54:29,830
like command line if i say quick editing
i will still sometimes use it but not

11002
02:54:29,830 --> 02:54:29,840
i will still sometimes use it but not
 

11003
02:54:29,840 --> 02:54:31,510
i will still sometimes use it but not
much like it's simple corrective

11004
02:54:31,510 --> 02:54:31,520
much like it's simple corrective
 

11005
02:54:31,520 --> 02:54:32,790
much like it's simple corrective
correctness single edited character so

11006
02:54:32,790 --> 02:54:32,800
correctness single edited character so
 

11007
02:54:32,800 --> 02:54:34,150
correctness single edited character so
when you were developing sci-fi you were

11008
02:54:34,150 --> 02:54:34,160
when you were developing sci-fi you were
 

11009
02:54:34,160 --> 02:54:36,550
when you were developing sci-fi you were
using ebx yep siphon numpy are already

11010
02:54:36,550 --> 02:54:36,560
using ebx yep siphon numpy are already
 

11011
02:54:36,560 --> 02:54:38,870
using ebx yep siphon numpy are already
in an e-max on a linux box

11012
02:54:38,870 --> 02:54:38,880
in an e-max on a linux box
 

11013
02:54:38,880 --> 02:54:40,230
in an e-max on a linux box
and uh

11014
02:54:40,230 --> 02:54:40,240
and uh
 

11015
02:54:40,240 --> 02:54:43,269
and uh
cvs and then svn version control git

11016
02:54:43,269 --> 02:54:43,279
cvs and then svn version control git
 

11017
02:54:43,279 --> 02:54:46,070
cvs and then svn version control git
came later like git has i love

11018
02:54:46,070 --> 02:54:46,080
came later like git has i love
 

11019
02:54:46,080 --> 02:54:48,630
came later like git has i love
distributed branch stuff i think git is

11020
02:54:48,630 --> 02:54:48,640
distributed branch stuff i think git is
 

11021
02:54:48,640 --> 02:54:50,710
distributed branch stuff i think git is
pretty complicated but i love the

11022
02:54:50,710 --> 02:54:50,720
pretty complicated but i love the
 

11023
02:54:50,720 --> 02:54:53,750
pretty complicated but i love the
concept and uh also of course github is

11024
02:54:53,750 --> 02:54:53,760
concept and uh also of course github is
 

11025
02:54:53,760 --> 02:54:56,150
concept and uh also of course github is
uh and then git lab make git

11026
02:54:56,150 --> 02:54:56,160
uh and then git lab make git
 

11027
02:54:56,160 --> 02:54:57,830
uh and then git lab make git
definitely consumable

11028
02:54:57,830 --> 02:54:57,840
definitely consumable
 

11029
02:54:57,840 --> 02:54:59,750
definitely consumable
um but that came later did you ever

11030
02:54:59,750 --> 02:54:59,760
um but that came later did you ever
 

11031
02:54:59,760 --> 02:55:01,590
um but that came later did you ever
touch lisp at all like what were you

11032
02:55:01,590 --> 02:55:01,600
touch lisp at all like what were you
 

11033
02:55:01,600 --> 02:55:03,910
touch lisp at all like what were you
what yeah emotional feelings about the

11034
02:55:03,910 --> 02:55:03,920
what yeah emotional feelings about the
 

11035
02:55:03,920 --> 02:55:06,070
what yeah emotional feelings about the
parenthesis great question so i find

11036
02:55:06,070 --> 02:55:06,080
parenthesis great question so i find
 

11037
02:55:06,080 --> 02:55:08,550
parenthesis great question so i find
myself appreciating this today much more

11038
02:55:08,550 --> 02:55:08,560
myself appreciating this today much more
 

11039
02:55:08,560 --> 02:55:10,309
myself appreciating this today much more
than i did early because when i came to

11040
02:55:10,309 --> 02:55:10,319
than i did early because when i came to
 

11041
02:55:10,319 --> 02:55:11,830
than i did early because when i came to
programming i knew programming but i was

11042
02:55:11,830 --> 02:55:11,840
programming i knew programming but i was
 

11043
02:55:11,840 --> 02:55:13,670
programming i knew programming but i was
a domain expert right and to me the

11044
02:55:13,670 --> 02:55:13,680
a domain expert right and to me the
 

11045
02:55:13,680 --> 02:55:15,510
a domain expert right and to me the
parentheses were in the way

11046
02:55:15,510 --> 02:55:15,520
parentheses were in the way
 

11047
02:55:15,520 --> 02:55:16,550
parentheses were in the way
it's like wow

11048
02:55:16,550 --> 02:55:16,560
it's like wow
 

11049
02:55:16,560 --> 02:55:18,389
it's like wow
it's just all this like it just gets in

11050
02:55:18,389 --> 02:55:18,399
it's just all this like it just gets in
 

11051
02:55:18,399 --> 02:55:19,510
it's just all this like it just gets in
the way of my thinking about what i'm

11052
02:55:19,510 --> 02:55:19,520
the way of my thinking about what i'm
 

11053
02:55:19,520 --> 02:55:21,030
the way of my thinking about what i'm
doing so why would i have all these

11054
02:55:21,030 --> 02:55:21,040
doing so why would i have all these
 

11055
02:55:21,040 --> 02:55:21,910
doing so why would i have all these
right

11056
02:55:21,910 --> 02:55:21,920
right
 

11057
02:55:21,920 --> 02:55:24,309
right
um that was my initial reaction to it uh

11058
02:55:24,309 --> 02:55:24,319
um that was my initial reaction to it uh
 

11059
02:55:24,319 --> 02:55:26,630
um that was my initial reaction to it uh
you know now as i appreciate kind of the

11060
02:55:26,630 --> 02:55:26,640
you know now as i appreciate kind of the
 

11061
02:55:26,640 --> 02:55:28,389
you know now as i appreciate kind of the
structure that kind of naturally maps to

11062
02:55:28,389 --> 02:55:28,399
structure that kind of naturally maps to
 

11063
02:55:28,399 --> 02:55:31,190
structure that kind of naturally maps to
the to logical thinking about a program

11064
02:55:31,190 --> 02:55:31,200
the to logical thinking about a program
 

11065
02:55:31,200 --> 02:55:33,349
the to logical thinking about a program
i can appreciate them right and why it's

11066
02:55:33,349 --> 02:55:33,359
i can appreciate them right and why it's
 

11067
02:55:33,359 --> 02:55:35,030
i can appreciate them right and why it's
actually you could you you could create

11068
02:55:35,030 --> 02:55:35,040
actually you could you you could create
 

11069
02:55:35,040 --> 02:55:37,429
actually you could you you could create
editors that make it not so

11070
02:55:37,429 --> 02:55:37,439
editors that make it not so
 

11071
02:55:37,439 --> 02:55:40,950
editors that make it not so
problematic right honestly um yeah so i

11072
02:55:40,950 --> 02:55:40,960
problematic right honestly um yeah so i
 

11073
02:55:40,960 --> 02:55:42,389
problematic right honestly um yeah so i
actually have a much more appreciation

11074
02:55:42,389 --> 02:55:42,399
actually have a much more appreciation
 

11075
02:55:42,399 --> 02:55:43,910
actually have a much more appreciation
of lisp and things like closure and

11076
02:55:43,910 --> 02:55:43,920
of lisp and things like closure and
 

11077
02:55:43,920 --> 02:55:45,750
of lisp and things like closure and
there's hyvee which is a python you know

11078
02:55:45,750 --> 02:55:45,760
there's hyvee which is a python you know
 

11079
02:55:45,760 --> 02:55:47,110
there's hyvee which is a python you know
a list that compiles the python byte

11080
02:55:47,110 --> 02:55:47,120
a list that compiles the python byte
 

11081
02:55:47,120 --> 02:55:48,070
a list that compiles the python byte
code

11082
02:55:48,070 --> 02:55:48,080
code
 

11083
02:55:48,080 --> 02:55:50,389
code
um i think it's challenging like

11084
02:55:50,389 --> 02:55:50,399
um i think it's challenging like
 

11085
02:55:50,399 --> 02:55:51,590
um i think it's challenging like
typically

11086
02:55:51,590 --> 02:55:51,600
typically
 

11087
02:55:51,600 --> 02:55:53,429
typically
these languages are you know i even saw

11088
02:55:53,429 --> 02:55:53,439
these languages are you know i even saw
 

11089
02:55:53,439 --> 02:55:55,110
these languages are you know i even saw
a whole data science programming system

11090
02:55:55,110 --> 02:55:55,120
a whole data science programming system
 

11091
02:55:55,120 --> 02:55:57,030
a whole data science programming system
in lisp that somebody created which is

11092
02:55:57,030 --> 02:55:57,040
in lisp that somebody created which is
 

11093
02:55:57,040 --> 02:55:59,510
in lisp that somebody created which is
you know cool but again it's the i think

11094
02:55:59,510 --> 02:55:59,520
you know cool but again it's the i think
 

11095
02:55:59,520 --> 02:56:01,190
you know cool but again it's the i think
it's the lack of recognition of the fact

11096
02:56:01,190 --> 02:56:01,200
it's the lack of recognition of the fact
 

11097
02:56:01,200 --> 02:56:02,710
it's the lack of recognition of the fact
that there exists what i call occasional

11098
02:56:02,710 --> 02:56:02,720
that there exists what i call occasional
 

11099
02:56:02,720 --> 02:56:04,630
that there exists what i call occasional
programmers yes people are never going

11100
02:56:04,630 --> 02:56:04,640
programmers yes people are never going
 

11101
02:56:04,640 --> 02:56:05,830
programmers yes people are never going
to be programmers for a living they

11102
02:56:05,830 --> 02:56:05,840
to be programmers for a living they
 

11103
02:56:05,840 --> 02:56:07,830
to be programmers for a living they
don't want to have all this the cuteness

11104
02:56:07,830 --> 02:56:07,840
don't want to have all this the cuteness
 

11105
02:56:07,840 --> 02:56:09,510
don't want to have all this the cuteness
in their head they want just

11106
02:56:09,510 --> 02:56:09,520
in their head they want just
 

11107
02:56:09,520 --> 02:56:12,870
in their head they want just
it's why basic you know microsoft had

11108
02:56:12,870 --> 02:56:12,880
it's why basic you know microsoft had
 

11109
02:56:12,880 --> 02:56:14,790
it's why basic you know microsoft had
the right idea with basic in terms of

11110
02:56:14,790 --> 02:56:14,800
the right idea with basic in terms of
 

11111
02:56:14,800 --> 02:56:16,790
the right idea with basic in terms of
having that be the language of

11112
02:56:16,790 --> 02:56:16,800
having that be the language of
 

11113
02:56:16,800 --> 02:56:19,190
having that be the language of
visual basic the language of excel and

11114
02:56:19,190 --> 02:56:19,200
visual basic the language of excel and
 

11115
02:56:19,200 --> 02:56:21,510
visual basic the language of excel and
um sql sql server they should have

11116
02:56:21,510 --> 02:56:21,520
um sql sql server they should have
 

11117
02:56:21,520 --> 02:56:23,349
um sql sql server they should have
converted that to python 10 years ago

11118
02:56:23,349 --> 02:56:23,359
converted that to python 10 years ago
 

11119
02:56:23,359 --> 02:56:25,030
converted that to python 10 years ago
but the world would be a better place

11120
02:56:25,030 --> 02:56:25,040
but the world would be a better place
 

11121
02:56:25,040 --> 02:56:27,030
but the world would be a better place
that they had but

11122
02:56:27,030 --> 02:56:27,040
that they had but
 

11123
02:56:27,040 --> 02:56:29,110
that they had but
there's also uh there's a beauty and a

11124
02:56:29,110 --> 02:56:29,120
there's also uh there's a beauty and a
 

11125
02:56:29,120 --> 02:56:31,030
there's also uh there's a beauty and a
magic to the history behind a language

11126
02:56:31,030 --> 02:56:31,040
magic to the history behind a language
 

11127
02:56:31,040 --> 02:56:32,950
magic to the history behind a language
and lisp you know some of the most

11128
02:56:32,950 --> 02:56:32,960
and lisp you know some of the most
 

11129
02:56:32,960 --> 02:56:35,030
and lisp you know some of the most
interesting people in in the history of

11130
02:56:35,030 --> 02:56:35,040
interesting people in in the history of
 

11131
02:56:35,040 --> 02:56:36,309
interesting people in in the history of
computer science and artificial

11132
02:56:36,309 --> 02:56:36,319

02:59:10,870 --> 02:59:10,880
one of the things i talk a lot about
 

11287
02:59:10,880 --> 02:59:13,910
one of the things i talk a lot about
internally at my companies is that the

11288
02:59:13,910 --> 02:59:13,920
internally at my companies is that the
 

11289
02:59:13,920 --> 02:59:15,910
internally at my companies is that the
whole idea of measuring ourselves

11290
02:59:15,910 --> 02:59:15,920
whole idea of measuring ourselves
 

11291
02:59:15,920 --> 02:59:18,469
whole idea of measuring ourselves
against the unit a single axis is flawed

11292
02:59:18,469 --> 02:59:18,479
against the unit a single axis is flawed
 

11293
02:59:18,479 --> 02:59:19,429
against the unit a single axis is flawed
because we're not it's a

11294
02:59:19,429 --> 02:59:19,439
because we're not it's a
 

11295
02:59:19,439 --> 02:59:20,790
because we're not it's a
multi-dimensional space and how do you

11296
02:59:20,790 --> 02:59:20,800
multi-dimensional space and how do you
 

11297
02:59:20,800 --> 02:59:22,150
multi-dimensional space and how do you
order a multi-dimensional space there

11298
02:59:22,150 --> 02:59:22,160
order a multi-dimensional space there
 

11299
02:59:22,160 --> 02:59:24,309
order a multi-dimensional space there
isn't one ordering so this whole idea

11300
02:59:24,309 --> 02:59:24,319
isn't one ordering so this whole idea
 

11301
02:59:24,319 --> 02:59:26,309
isn't one ordering so this whole idea
you you immediately have projected into

11302
02:59:26,309 --> 02:59:26,319
you you immediately have projected into
 

11303
02:59:26,319 --> 02:59:28,070
you you immediately have projected into
a thing when you're talking about hiring

11304
02:59:28,070 --> 02:59:28,080
a thing when you're talking about hiring
 

11305
02:59:28,080 --> 02:59:30,550
a thing when you're talking about hiring
or best or worst or better or not better

11306
02:59:30,550 --> 02:59:30,560
or best or worst or better or not better
 

11307
02:59:30,560 --> 02:59:32,389
or best or worst or better or not better
so what is the thing you're actually

11308
02:59:32,389 --> 02:59:32,399
so what is the thing you're actually
 

11309
02:59:32,399 --> 02:59:33,349
so what is the thing you're actually
needing

11310
02:59:33,349 --> 02:59:33,359
needing
 

11311
02:59:33,359 --> 02:59:36,070
needing
and you can even hire for that there is

11312
02:59:36,070 --> 02:59:36,080
and you can even hire for that there is
 

11313
02:59:36,080 --> 02:59:38,550
and you can even hire for that there is
such a thing generally i really value

11314
02:59:38,550 --> 02:59:38,560
such a thing generally i really value
 

11315
02:59:38,560 --> 02:59:41,269
such a thing generally i really value
people who have the affect

11316
02:59:41,269 --> 02:59:41,279
people who have the affect
 

11317
02:59:41,279 --> 02:59:43,110
people who have the affect
they care about open source like so in

11318
02:59:43,110 --> 02:59:43,120
they care about open source like so in
 

11319
02:59:43,120 --> 02:59:45,590
they care about open source like so in
some cases their affinity to open source

11320
02:59:45,590 --> 02:59:45,600
some cases their affinity to open source
 

11321
02:59:45,600 --> 02:59:47,269
some cases their affinity to open source
is simply a kind of a filter of an

11322
02:59:47,269 --> 02:59:47,279
is simply a kind of a filter of an
 

11323

affect
 

11325
02:59:48,960 --> 02:59:51,750
affect
however i have found this interesting

11326
02:59:51,750 --> 02:59:51,760
however i have found this interesting
 

11327
02:59:51,760 --> 02:59:53,429
however i have found this interesting
dichotomy between

11328
02:59:53,429 --> 02:59:53,439
dichotomy between
 

11329
02:59:53,439 --> 02:59:55,750
dichotomy between
open source contributors and

11330
02:59:55,750 --> 02:59:55,760
open source contributors and
 

11331
02:59:55,760 --> 02:59:58,469
open source contributors and
product creation

11332
02:59:58,469 --> 02:59:58,479
product creation
 

11333
02:59:58,479 --> 03:00:00,469
product creation
there's i don't know if it's fully true

11334
03:00:00,469 --> 03:00:00,479
there's i don't know if it's fully true
 

11335
03:00:00,479 --> 03:00:03,590
there's i don't know if it's fully true
but there does seem to be the more

11336
03:00:03,590 --> 03:00:03,600
but there does seem to be the more
 

11337
03:00:03,600 --> 03:00:05,750
but there does seem to be the more
uh the more experience the more affect

11338
03:00:05,750 --> 03:00:05,760
uh the more experience the more affect
 

11339
03:00:05,760 --> 03:00:07,990
uh the more experience the more affect
somebody has an open source community

11340
03:00:07,990 --> 03:00:08,000
somebody has an open source community
 

11341
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:09,510
somebody has an open source community
the less ability to actually produce

11342
03:00:09,510 --> 03:00:09,520
the less ability to actually produce
 

11343
03:00:09,520 --> 03:00:11,510

product that they have
 

11345
03:00:11,520 --> 03:00:13,510
product that they have
but the other one's kind of true too the

11346
03:00:13,510 --> 03:00:13,520
but the other one's kind of true too the
 

11347
03:00:13,520 --> 03:00:15,590
but the other one's kind of true too the
more product focused star i find a lot

11348
03:00:15,590 --> 03:00:15,600
more product focused star i find a lot
 

11349
03:00:15,600 --> 03:00:16,630
more product focused star i find a lot
of people talk to a lot of people who

11350
03:00:16,630 --> 03:00:16,640
of people talk to a lot of people who
 

11351
03:00:16,640 --> 03:00:18,389
of people talk to a lot of people who
produce really great products and they

11352
03:00:18,389 --> 03:00:18,399
produce really great products and they
 

11353
03:00:18,399 --> 03:00:20,230
produce really great products and they
they have a they're looking over the

11354
03:00:20,230 --> 03:00:20,240
they have a they're looking over the
 

11355
03:00:20,240 --> 03:00:21,670
they have a they're looking over the
open source communities kind of wanting

11356
03:00:21,670 --> 03:00:21,680
open source communities kind of wanting
 

11357
03:00:21,680 --> 03:00:23,510
open source communities kind of wanting
to participate and play but they've

11358
03:00:23,510 --> 03:00:23,520
to participate and play but they've
 

11359
03:00:23,520 --> 03:00:24,469
to participate and play but they've
played here

11360
03:00:24,469 --> 03:00:24,479
played here
 

11361
03:00:24,479 --> 03:00:26,150
played here
and they do a great job here and then

11362
03:00:26,150 --> 03:00:26,160
and they do a great job here and then
 

11363
03:00:26,160 --> 03:00:27,429
and they do a great job here and then
they

11364

they
 

11365
03:00:27,439 --> 03:00:29,349
they
don't necessarily have some of the same

11366

don't necessarily have some of the same
 

11367
03:00:29,359 --> 03:00:30,389
don't necessarily have some of the same
i don't think that i don't think that's

11368
03:00:30,389 --> 03:00:30,399
i don't think that i don't think that's
 

11369
03:00:30,399 --> 03:00:32,630
i don't think that i don't think that's
entirely necessary i think part of it is

11370
03:00:32,630 --> 03:00:32,640
entirely necessary i think part of it is
 

11371
03:00:32,640 --> 03:00:34,389
entirely necessary i think part of it is
cultural how that's how they've emerged

11372
03:00:34,389 --> 03:00:34,399
cultural how that's how they've emerged
 

11373
03:00:34,399 --> 03:00:35,429
cultural how that's how they've emerged
except because one of the things that

11374
03:00:35,429 --> 03:00:35,439
except because one of the things that
 

11375
03:00:35,439 --> 03:00:37,510
except because one of the things that
open source communities often lack is

11376
03:00:37,510 --> 03:00:37,520
open source communities often lack is
 

11377
03:00:37,520 --> 03:00:39,349
open source communities often lack is
great product management like some

11378
03:00:39,349 --> 03:00:39,359
great product management like some
 

11379
03:00:39,359 --> 03:00:40,950
great product management like some
product management energy that's

11380
03:00:40,950 --> 03:00:40,960
product management energy that's
 

11381
03:00:40,960 --> 03:00:42,790
product management energy that's
brilliant but you want both of those

11382
03:00:42,790 --> 03:00:42,800
brilliant but you want both of those
 

11383
03:00:42,800 --> 03:00:45,110
brilliant but you want both of those
energies in a second place together yes

11384
03:00:45,110 --> 03:00:45,120
energies in a second place together yes
 

11385
03:00:45,120 --> 03:00:46,710
energies in a second place together yes
you really do and so it's a lot of it's

11386
03:00:46,710 --> 03:00:46,720
you really do and so it's a lot of it's
 

11387
03:00:46,720 --> 03:00:48,309
you really do and so it's a lot of it's
creating these teams of people that have

11388
03:00:48,309 --> 03:00:48,319
creating these teams of people that have
 

11389
03:00:48,319 --> 03:00:50,550
creating these teams of people that have
these needed skills and attributes that

11390
03:00:50,550 --> 03:00:50,560
these needed skills and attributes that
 

11391
03:00:50,560 --> 03:00:51,269
these needed skills and attributes that
are

11392
03:00:51,269 --> 03:00:51,279
are
 

11393
03:00:51,279 --> 03:00:52,790
are
hard and so

11394
03:00:52,790 --> 03:00:52,800
hard and so
 

11395
03:00:52,800 --> 03:00:54,630
hard and so
so one of the big things i look for is

11396
03:00:54,630 --> 03:00:54,640
so one of the big things i look for is
 

11397
03:00:54,640 --> 03:00:56,230
so one of the big things i look for is
somebody that fundamentally recognizes

11398
03:00:56,230 --> 03:00:56,240
somebody that fundamentally recognizes
 

11399
03:00:56,240 --> 03:00:57,990
somebody that fundamentally recognizes
their need to learn to learn like one of

11400
03:00:57,990 --> 03:00:58,000
their need to learn to learn like one of
 

11401
03:00:58,000 --> 03:00:59,750
their need to learn to learn like one of
the values that we we have and all of

11402
03:00:59,750 --> 03:00:59,760
the values that we we have and all of
 

11403
03:00:59,760 --> 03:01:02,389
the values that we we have and all of
the things we do is learning like

11404
03:01:02,389 --> 03:01:02,399
the things we do is learning like
 

11405
03:01:02,399 --> 03:01:04,469
the things we do is learning like
if somebody thinks they know it all

11406
03:01:04,469 --> 03:01:04,479
if somebody thinks they know it all
 

11407
03:01:04,479 --> 03:01:06,469
if somebody thinks they know it all
they're going to struggle and some of

11408
03:01:06,469 --> 03:01:06,479
they're going to struggle and some of
 

11409
03:01:06,479 --> 03:01:07,750
they're going to struggle and some of
that is just

11410
03:01:07,750 --> 03:01:07,760
that is just
 

11411
03:01:07,760 --> 03:01:10,469
that is just
there's more basic things like humility

11412
03:01:10,469 --> 03:01:10,479
there's more basic things like humility
 

11413
03:01:10,479 --> 03:01:11,349
there's more basic things like humility
just

11414
03:01:11,349 --> 03:01:11,359
just
 

11415
03:01:11,359 --> 03:01:13,510
just
being humble in the face of all the

11416
03:01:13,510 --> 03:01:13,520
being humble in the face of all the
 

11417
03:01:13,520 --> 03:01:14,870
being humble in the face of all the
things you don't know and that's like

11418
03:01:14,870 --> 03:01:14,880
things you don't know and that's like
 

11419
03:01:14,880 --> 03:01:16,309
things you don't know and that's like
step one of learning that's step one of

11420
03:01:16,309 --> 03:01:16,319
step one of learning that's step one of
 

11421
03:01:16,319 --> 03:01:18,710
step one of learning that's step one of
learning right and you know i've spent a

11422
03:01:18,710 --> 03:01:18,720
learning right and you know i've spent a
 

11423
03:01:18,720 --> 03:01:21,030
learning right and you know i've spent a
lot of time learning right other people

11424
03:01:21,030 --> 03:01:21,040
lot of time learning right other people
 

11425
03:01:21,040 --> 03:01:22,070
lot of time learning right other people
spend a lot more time but i've spent a

11426
03:01:22,070 --> 03:01:22,080
spend a lot more time but i've spent a
 

11427
03:01:22,080 --> 03:01:23,429
spend a lot more time but i've spent a
lot of time learning i mean my whole

11428
03:01:23,429 --> 03:01:23,439
lot of time learning i mean my whole
 

11429
03:01:23,439 --> 03:01:25,750
lot of time learning i mean my whole
goal was to get a phd because i loved

11430
03:01:25,750 --> 03:01:25,760
goal was to get a phd because i loved
 

11431
03:01:25,760 --> 03:01:28,150
goal was to get a phd because i loved
school and i wanted to be a scientist

11432
03:01:28,150 --> 03:01:28,160
school and i wanted to be a scientist
 

11433
03:01:28,160 --> 03:01:29,349
school and i wanted to be a scientist
and then

11434
03:01:29,349 --> 03:01:29,359
and then
 

11435
03:01:29,359 --> 03:01:30,790
and then
what i found is what's been written

11436
03:01:30,790 --> 03:01:30,800
what i found is what's been written
 

11437
03:01:30,800 --> 03:01:32,150
what i found is what's been written
about elsewhere as well is the more i

11438
03:01:32,150 --> 03:01:32,160
about elsewhere as well is the more i
 

11439
03:01:32,160 --> 03:01:33,910
about elsewhere as well is the more i
learned the more i didn't know the more

11440
03:01:33,910 --> 03:01:33,920
