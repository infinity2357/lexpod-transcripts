00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:12,880

 

575
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,550

as gentrification happened and they

576
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:14,560
as gentrification happened and they
 

577
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,829
as gentrification happened and they
started building more luxury

578
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:15,839
started building more luxury
 

579
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:16,790
started building more luxury
condominiums

580
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:16,800
condominiums
 

581
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,910

587
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,110
businesses and i think
that kind of changed the the makeup of

588
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,120
that kind of changed the the makeup of
 

589
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,710
that kind of changed the the makeup of
the community and it wasn't only because

590
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
the community and it wasn't only because
 

591
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,350
the community and it wasn't only because
there was an

592
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:27,360
there was an
 

593
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,829
there was an
influx of new young people with

594
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:29,839
influx of new young people with
 

595
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,110
influx of new young people with
disposable income

596
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
disposable income
 

597
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,269
disposable income
it's because there's an exodus of the

598
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:33,279
it's because there's an exodus of the
 

599
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,030
it's because there's an exodus of the
the older people who kind of grew up and

600
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,040
the older people who kind of grew up and
 

601
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,990
the older people who kind of grew up and
raised their families there because

602
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,000
raised their families there because
 

603
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,910
raised their families there because
they were being offered humongous sums

604
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:37,920
they were being offered humongous sums
 

605
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,269
they were being offered humongous sums
of money for their homes that they had

606
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:39,279
of money for their homes that they had
 

607
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,790
of money for their homes that they had
bought like in the late 70s and early

608
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:40,800
bought like in the late 70s and early
 

609
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,350
bought like in the late 70s and early
80s

610
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,360
80s
 

611
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,110
80s
so that they could develop those areas

612
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,120
so that they could develop those areas
 

613
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,030
so that they could develop those areas
so you have a combination of the influx

614
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,040
so you have a combination of the influx
 

615
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,990

of new people

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,630
what started the marriage between
martial arts and

1330
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:26,640

1331
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,909
martial arts and

someone else's charge and you're told to
 

1335
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,110
someone else's charge and you're told to
go out and walk in a line

go out and walk in a line
 

1337

go out and walk in a line
and you know overtake some germanic

1338
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:35,679
and you know overtake some germanic
 

1339
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:36,789
and you know overtake some germanic
tribe somewhere

1340
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:36,799
tribe somewhere
 

1341
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,710
tribe somewhere
and that happens all the time um

1342
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:40,720
and that happens all the time um
 

1343
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,909
and that happens all the time um
your job is being a soldier there's on

any given day you might not come home
 

1347
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,990
any given day you might not come home
so i think that you have to start your

1348
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:48,000
so i think that you have to start your
 

1349
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,710
so i think that you have to start your
day by thinking deeply about

1350
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:50,720
day by thinking deeply about
 

1351
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,470
day by thinking deeply about
how you've lived to that point and the

1352
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:52,480
how you've lived to that point and the
 

1353
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,470
how you've lived to that point and the
people that are living in and around you

1354
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:54,480
people that are living in and around you
 

1355
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,070
people that are living in and around you
and how you've treated them and i think

1356
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,080
and how you've treated them and i think
 

1357
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,669
and how you've treated them and i think
that probably is what started the

1358
00:21:57,669 --> 00:21:57,679
that probably is what started the
 

1359
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:58,549
that probably is what started the
marriage of

1360
00:21:58,549 --> 00:21:58,559
marriage of
 

1361
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,350
marriage of
being kind of like a philosophical

differently
do you think there's echoes of that in

1394
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:30,799
do you think there's echoes of that in
 

1395
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,070
do you think there's echoes of that in
just even the sport

1396
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,080
just even the sport
 

1397
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,510
just even the sport
of uh like grappling and jiu jitsu where

1400
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:37,200
you're facing your own mortality we
 

1401
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,510

don't really think of it that way but

1402
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:39,520
don't really think of it that way but
 

1403
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,190
don't really think of it that way but
to be honest i think that a lot of

1404
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:41,200
to be honest i think that a lot of
 

1405
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,909
to be honest i think that a lot of
people that train in a martial art

1406
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:43,919
people that train in a martial art
 

1407
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,149
people that train in a martial art
in contemporary society i don't consider

i think just because you train a martial
 

1413
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,110
i think just because you train a martial
art does not mean you're a martial

1414
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:51,120
art does not mean you're a martial
 

1415
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,029
art does not mean you're a martial
artist there are so many people that

something they do it's not something

1430
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:08,159
something they do it's not something
 

1431
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,270
something they do it's not something
they are

1432
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:09,280
they are
 

1433
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,950
they are
and i think there's a big difference

1434
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:10,960
and i think there's a big difference
 

1435
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,190
and i think there's a big difference
there there's a bunch of stuff mixed up

1436
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,200
there there's a bunch of stuff mixed up
 

1437
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,710
there there's a bunch of stuff mixed up
in there because the instagram thing

1438
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:14,720
in there because the instagram thing
 

1439
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,830
in there because the instagram thing
is something you do for

1440
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:17,840
is something you do for
 

1441
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,830
is something you do for
it's also it could be something you are

1442
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:19,840
it's also it could be something you are
 

1443
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,230
it's also it could be something you are
for display versus who

1444
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:22,240
for display versus who
 

1445
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,470
for display versus who
you are in the private moments of

1446
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:24,480
you are in the private moments of
 

1447
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,470
you are in the private moments of
searching and thinking and struggling

1448
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:26,480
searching and thinking and struggling
 

1449
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,990
searching and thinking and struggling
and all that kind of stuff instagram is

1450
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,000
and all that kind of stuff instagram is
 

1451
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,590
and all that kind of stuff instagram is
a surface layer

1452
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:29,600
a surface layer
 

1453
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,870
a surface layer
that much of modern society uh

1454
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:32,880
that much of modern society uh
 

1455
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,110
that much of modern society uh
operates in which is really problematic

1456
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,120
operates in which is really problematic
 

1457
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,270
operates in which is really problematic
because there's that gap

1458
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:37,280
because there's that gap
 

1459
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,390
because there's that gap
between the person you show to the world

1460
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:40,400

a younger person
 

2175
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,310
a younger person
there was a lot more manifestation of

um people who were not as close to me
 

2183
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,230
um people who were not as close to me
probably saw more of the violent side

2184
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:42,240
probably saw more of the violent side
 

2185
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,910
probably saw more of the violent side
only the very close people to me saw

2186
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:43,920
only the very close people to me saw

what would pass for the kind side and
 

2191
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,150
what would pass for the kind side and

returns
 

2225
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,510
returns
but i've learned i've learned better how

2226
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:23,520
but i've learned i've learned better how
 

2227
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:23,990
but i've learned i've learned better how
to

2228
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:24,000
to
 

2229
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,630
to
manifest it in competition in terms of

2230
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:26,640
manifest it in competition in terms of
 

2231
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,230
manifest it in competition in terms of
like the effects that that type of

2232
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:28,240
like the effects that that type of
 

2233
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,910
like the effects that that type of
emotion has on you physically in the

2234
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:29,920
emotion has on you physically in the
 

2235
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,109
emotion has on you physically in the
middle of a competition

2236
00:36:31,109 --> 00:36:31,119
middle of a competition
 

2237
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,430
middle of a competition
so i've better learn how to utilize that

2238
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:33,440
so i've better learn how to utilize that
 

2239
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,390
so i've better learn how to utilize that
energy

2240
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:34,400
energy
 

2241
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,950
energy
but i think another side effect of this

2242
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:36,960
but i think another side effect of this
 

2243
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,550
but i think another side effect of this

under those exact same rules there's a

2694
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:26,480
under those exact same rules there's a
 

2695
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,309
under those exact same rules there's a
different approach to it

00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,910

it's interesting like as a thought

2986
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:23,920
it's interesting like as a thought

it depends on who depends on you if you

3000
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:41,440
it depends on who depends on you if you
 

3001
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,150
it depends on who depends on you if you
have a

3002
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:42,160
have a
 

3003
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,990
have a
if you have a family and like young kids

3004
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:44,000
if you have a family and like young kids
 

3005
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,750
if you have a family and like young kids
and stuff like that i think your

3006
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:45,760
and stuff like that i think your
 

3007
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,309
and stuff like that i think your
your obligation is primarily to them and

3008
00:49:48,309 --> 00:49:48,319
your obligation is primarily to them and
 

3009

your obligation is primarily to them and
therefore

therefore
 

3011
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,309
therefore
surrender has to be something that you

3012
00:49:50,309 --> 00:49:50,319
surrender has to be something that you
 

3013
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,950
surrender has to be something that you
consider in that in that moment in time

3014
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:52,960
consider in that in that moment in time
 

3015
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,870
consider in that in that moment in time
so that you can uh take care of those

3016
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:54,880
so that you can uh take care of those
 

3017
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,470
so that you can uh take care of those
people if you're a man alone and you've

3018
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:56,480
people if you're a man alone and you've
 

3019
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,750
people if you're a man alone and you've
got like all these principles and all

potentially
 

3035
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,670
potentially
but i think if there's someone else out

3047
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,430

in this weight of like what do i value

3048
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:23,440
in this weight of like what do i value
 

3049
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,270
in this weight of like what do i value
more the principles i hold versus

00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:25,280
more the principles i hold versus
 

3051

it seems that now we don't value
 

3055
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,990
it seems that now we don't value
principles as much

3344
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:34,400

3345
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,829
know that number for people yeah
and and i think it's a weird thing too

3346
00:55:35,829 --> 00:55:35,839
and and i think it's a weird thing too
 

3347
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:37,510
and and i think it's a weird thing too
because you think right away like okay

3348
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:37,520
because you think right away like okay
 

3349
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,030
because you think right away like okay
it must be the group of people that are

3350
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:39,040
it must be the group of people that are
 

3351
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,390
it must be the group of people that are
the closest to you that's who you're

3352
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:40,400
the closest to you that's who you're
 

3353
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,750
the closest to you that's who you're
first thinking of right

3354
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:41,760
first thinking of right
 

3355
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,150
first thinking of right
but obviously for like my best friend i

3356
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:44,160
but obviously for like my best friend i
 

3357
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,670
but obviously for like my best friend i
would do it no question about it

3358
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:45,680
would do it no question about it
 

3359
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,870
would do it no question about it
but i've got other people that are close

3360
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:46,880
but i've got other people that are close
 

3361
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,190
but i've got other people that are close
to me that

3362
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:49,200
to me that
 

3363
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,870
to me that
are close to me in other ways and i

3364
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:50,880
are close to me in other ways and i
 

3365
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,309
are close to me in other ways and i
probably wouldn't do that only because i

3366
00:55:52,309 --> 00:55:52,319
probably wouldn't do that only because i
 

3367
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,150
probably wouldn't do that only because i
don't think they do it for me

3368
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:54,160
don't think they do it for me
 

3369
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,510
don't think they do it for me
yeah and and that is a consideration um

3370
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:57,520
yeah and and that is a consideration um
 

3371
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,069
yeah and and that is a consideration um
so i guess is the principle there then

3372
00:56:00,069 --> 00:56:00,079
so i guess is the principle there then
 

3373
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:00,710
so i guess is the principle there then
that

3374
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:00,720
that
 

3375
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,549
that
you do for your friends what you think

3376
00:56:02,549 --> 00:56:02,559
you do for your friends what you think
 

3377
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,829
you do for your friends what you think
they would do for you is that the

3378
00:56:03,829 --> 00:56:03,839
they would do for you is that the
 

3379
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,109
they would do for you is that the
underlying principle

3380
00:56:05,109 --> 00:56:05,119
underlying principle
 

3381
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,349
underlying principle
or do you just have a blind loyalty to

3382
00:56:07,349 --> 00:56:07,359
or do you just have a blind loyalty to
 

3383
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:08,470
or do you just have a blind loyalty to
you know

3384
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:08,480

00:56:12,549 --> 00:56:12,559
inner circle
 

3391
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:15,270
inner circle
that i probably wouldn't help change a

3392
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:15,280
that i probably wouldn't help change a
 

3393
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,630
that i probably wouldn't help change a
tire at two in the morning if they were

3394
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:16,640
tire at two in the morning if they were
 

3395
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,069
tire at two in the morning if they were
on the highway but if they called me and

3396
00:56:18,069 --> 00:56:18,079
on the highway but if they called me and
 

3397
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:19,589
on the highway but if they called me and
said hey we got to bury the body

3398
00:56:19,589 --> 00:56:19,599
said hey we got to bury the body
 

3399
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:21,109
said hey we got to bury the body
i might show up for that it's just these

3400
00:56:21,109 --> 00:56:21,119
i might show up for that it's just these
 

3401
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:22,630
i might show up for that it's just these
weird different connections yeah

3402
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:22,640
weird different connections yeah
 

3403
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,549
weird different connections yeah
it's fascinating yeah i have uh close

3404
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:24,559
it's fascinating yeah i have uh close
 

3405
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:25,910
it's fascinating yeah i have uh close
friends that like

3406
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:25,920
friends that like
 

3407
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,910
friends that like
i probably exactly the tire is a good

3408
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:27,920
i probably exactly the tire is a good
 

3409
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,349
i probably exactly the tire is a good
example would be like can't you find

3410
00:56:29,349 --> 00:56:29,359
example would be like can't you find
 

3411
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:31,349
example would be like can't you find
somebody else to do this

3412
00:56:31,349 --> 00:56:31,359
somebody else to do this
 

3413
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:34,870
somebody else to do this
i think part of that is just this leap

3414
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:34,880
i think part of that is just this leap
 

3415
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,150
i think part of that is just this leap
of faith into like giving yourself

3416
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:38,160
of faith into like giving yourself
 

3417
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,190
of faith into like giving yourself
to the other person that

3418
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:41,200
to the other person that
 

3419
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,230
to the other person that
uh creates a deep connection that makes

3420
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:44,240
uh creates a deep connection that makes
 

3421
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,750
uh creates a deep connection that makes
life

3422
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:45,760
life
 

3423
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,109
life
fulfilling like meaningful

3424
00:56:49,109 --> 00:56:49,119
fulfilling like meaningful
 

3425
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:51,030
fulfilling like meaningful
that doesn't exist if you don't take

3426
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:51,040
that doesn't exist if you don't take
 

3427
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,390
that doesn't exist if you don't take
that leap i mean it's not about the

3428
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:52,400
that leap i mean it's not about the
 

3429
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,750
that leap i mean it's not about the
murder we're sort of focusing

3430
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:53,760
murder we're sort of focusing
 

3431
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,950
murder we're sort of focusing
i think that's a i think you have to uh

3432
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:56,960
i think that's a i think you have to uh
 

3433
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,630
i think that's a i think you have to uh
what does it cross that bridge when you

3434
00:56:58,630 --> 00:56:58,640
what does it cross that bridge when you
 

3435
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,309
what does it cross that bridge when you
get there i'm not exactly sure this is

3436
00:57:00,309 --> 00:57:00,319
get there i'm not exactly sure this is
 

3437
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:01,750
get there i'm not exactly sure this is
just a thought experiment

3438
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:01,760
just a thought experiment
 

3439
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,030
just a thought experiment
but it's it's i think about that a lot

3440
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:05,040
but it's it's i think about that a lot
 

3441
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,630
but it's it's i think about that a lot
especially these covet times

3442
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:06,640
especially these covet times
 

3443
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,789
especially these covet times
and as like people become more and more

3444
00:57:08,789 --> 00:57:08,799
and as like people become more and more
 

3445
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:10,950
and as like people become more and more
isolated and separated from each other

3446
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:10,960
isolated and separated from each other
 

3447
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,870
isolated and separated from each other
like how important is it to have those

3448
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:12,880
like how important is it to have those
 

3449
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,309
like how important is it to have those
deep deep connections to other humans

3450
00:57:16,309 --> 00:57:16,319
deep deep connections to other humans
 

3451
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:17,990
deep deep connections to other humans
i think especially like what you're

3452
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:18,000
i think especially like what you're
 

3453
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:18,870
i think especially like what you're
talking about there have you ever seen

3454
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:18,880
talking about there have you ever seen
 

3455
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,069
talking about there have you ever seen
the movie the town

defending the same thing

3646
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:16,640
defending the same thing
 

3647
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,870
defending the same thing
over and over and over and you start to

3648
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:18,880
over and over and over and you start to
 

3649
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:19,670
over and over and over and you start to
think about it

3650
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:19,680
think about it
 

3651

think about it
and it's like well i i would really like

3652

and it's like well i i would really like
 

3653
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,349
and it's like well i i would really like
to evolve my thought process here and

3654
01:00:25,349 --> 01:00:25,359
to evolve my thought process here and
 

3655
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:27,030
to evolve my thought process here and
when you're constantly defending

3656
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:27,040
when you're constantly defending
 

3657
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,390
when you're constantly defending
you know one point it's difficult to let

3658
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:30,400
you know one point it's difficult to let
 

3659
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,349
you know one point it's difficult to let
other ideas in

3660
01:00:31,349 --> 01:00:31,359
other ideas in
 

3661
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:34,710
other ideas in
you you you discount the possibility

3662
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:34,720
you you you discount the possibility
 

3663
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:35,990
you you you discount the possibility
that you can have your mind change when

3664
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:36,000
that you can have your mind change when
 

3665
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,750
that you can have your mind change when
you're constantly on the defense like

3666
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:37,760
you're constantly on the defense like
 

3667
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,109
you're constantly on the defense like
you have to have a crack in

3668
01:00:39,109 --> 01:00:39,119
you have to have a crack in
 

3669
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:41,030
you have to have a crack in
in the front line in order to let a new

3670
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:41,040
in the front line in order to let a new
 

3671
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,270
in the front line in order to let a new
idea come in and possibly flourish

3672
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:43,280
idea come in and possibly flourish
 

3673
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,829
idea come in and possibly flourish
and maybe the new idea doesn't even

3674
01:00:45,829 --> 01:00:45,839
and maybe the new idea doesn't even
 

3675
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:47,750
and maybe the new idea doesn't even
prove your current belief system to be

3676
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:47,760
prove your current belief system to be
 

3677
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:48,309
prove your current belief system to be
wrong

3678
01:00:48,309 --> 01:00:48,319
wrong
 

3679
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:50,710
wrong
but maybe it's like the the water to a

3680
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:50,720
but maybe it's like the the water to a
 

3681
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,630
but maybe it's like the the water to a
seed and it grows and now it's something

3682
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:52,640
seed and it grows and now it's something
 

3683
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:53,829
seed and it grows and now it's something
even bigger and better

3684
01:00:53,829 --> 01:00:53,839
even bigger and better
 

3685
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:55,750
even bigger and better
yeah and you can you can start to work

3686
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:55,760
yeah and you can you can start to work
 

3687
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:56,950
yeah and you can you can start to work
with that instead

3688
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:56,960
with that instead
 

3689
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,710
with that instead
and it's a it's a tough thing because

3690
01:00:58,710 --> 01:00:58,720
and it's a it's a tough thing because
 

3691
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,470
and it's a it's a tough thing because
i'm a stubborn [\h__\h] and it's

3692
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:00,480
i'm a stubborn [\h__\h] and it's
 

3693
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,470
i'm a stubborn [\h__\h] and it's
very difficult for me it was

3694
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:02,480
very difficult for me it was
 

3695
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,750
very difficult for me it was
historically to say

01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,430
that's happening
and he just doesn't seem like the same

based on positioning and you know
 

4683
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,350
based on positioning and you know
composition

4684

things you want to think about is a
 

5301
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:42,950
things you want to think about is a
strength of opponent at the time you

5302
01:27:42,950 --> 01:27:42,960
strength of opponent at the time you
 

5303
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,149
strength of opponent at the time you
fought them

5304
01:27:44,149 --> 01:27:44,159
fought them
 

5305
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:47,189
fought them
so for example fighting bj penn

5306
01:27:47,189 --> 01:27:47,199
so for example fighting bj penn
 

5307
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:49,830
so for example fighting bj penn
in his prime and beating him is far

5308
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:49,840
in his prime and beating him is far
 

5309
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:52,070
in his prime and beating him is far
different than beating bj penn last year

5310
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:52,080
different than beating bj penn last year
 

5311
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:52,629
different than beating bj penn last year
right

5312
01:27:52,629 --> 01:27:52,639
right
 

5313
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:54,470
right
so to say you have a victory over bj

5314
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:54,480
so to say you have a victory over bj
 

5315
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:57,590
so to say you have a victory over bj
penn it's not the same given the time

5316
01:27:57,590 --> 01:27:57,600
penn it's not the same given the time
 

5317
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,669
penn it's not the same given the time
frame of when it happened not to take

5318
01:27:59,669 --> 01:27:59,679
frame of when it happened not to take
 

5319
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:01,350
frame of when it happened not to take
anything away from anyone was being b.j

5320
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:01,360
anything away from anyone was being b.j
 

5321
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:02,870
anything away from anyone was being b.j
penn

5322
01:28:02,870 --> 01:28:02,880
penn
 

5323
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,310
penn
just use that as an example of someone

5324
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:04,320
just use that as an example of someone
 

5325
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,470
just use that as an example of someone
whose career went into a different

5326
01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:06,480
whose career went into a different
 

5327
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:07,270
whose career went into a different
direction

5328
01:28:07,270 --> 01:28:07,280
direction
 

5329
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:11,510
direction
yes i would say

5330
01:28:11,510 --> 01:28:11,520

 

5331
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,629

the guy who i think is probably the best

5332
01:28:14,629 --> 01:28:14,639
the guy who i think is probably the best
 

5333
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:17,189
the guy who i think is probably the best
that people are the least familiar with

5334
01:28:17,189 --> 01:28:17,199
that people are the least familiar with
 

5335
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:19,590
that people are the least familiar with
would be marilla bustamante

5336
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:19,600

things
 

5855
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:47,430
things
differently but i do believe in the

5856
01:36:47,430 --> 01:36:47,440
differently but i do believe in the
 

5857
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:48,390
differently but i do believe in the
fourth round

5858
01:36:48,390 --> 01:36:48,400
fourth round
 

5859
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:49,669
fourth round
i think kyle would have won a fourth

5860

i think kyle would have won a fourth
 

5861
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:51,590
i think kyle would have won a fourth
round and i think maybe even won the

5862
01:36:51,590 --> 01:36:51,600
round and i think maybe even won the
 

5863
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:52,070
round and i think maybe even won the
fight and

5864

fight and
 

5865
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:53,430
fight and
if there would have been a fifth round

5866
01:36:53,430 --> 01:36:53,440
if there would have been a fifth round
 

5867
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,750
if there would have been a fifth round
and he was pressing forward

5868

and he was pressing forward
 

5869

and he was pressing forward
uh like perhaps you know in a funny way

5870
01:36:58,950 --> 01:36:58,960
uh like perhaps you know in a funny way
 

5871
01:36:58,960 --> 01:36:59,669
uh like perhaps you know in a funny way
that you could

5872
01:36:59,669 --> 01:36:59,679
that you could
 

5873
01:36:59,679 --> 01:37:01,350
that you could
tell me i'm wrong but it felt like he

5874
01:37:01,350 --> 01:37:01,360
tell me i'm wrong but it felt like he
 

5875
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:03,109
tell me i'm wrong but it felt like he
wasn't emphasizing like

5876
01:37:03,109 --> 01:37:03,119
wasn't emphasizing like
 

5877
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:05,109
wasn't emphasizing like
head movement at that point he went full

5878
01:37:05,109 --> 01:37:05,119
head movement at that point he went full
 

5879
01:37:05,119 --> 01:37:07,030
head movement at that point he went full
mike tyson there was a there was a point

5880
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:07,040
mike tyson there was a there was a point
 

5881
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:07,590
mike tyson there was a there was a point
at which

5882
01:37:07,590 --> 01:37:07,600
at which
 

5883
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,590
at which
so it's funny that you say that which is

5884
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:09,600
so it's funny that you say that which is
 

5885
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:11,189
so it's funny that you say that which is
a contradiction actually because

5886
01:37:11,189 --> 01:37:11,199
a contradiction actually because
 

5887
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:13,109
a contradiction actually because

5939
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:00,550
and the head movement and i didn't even
mention it and then we started to like

5940
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:00,560
mention it and then we started to like
 

5941
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:01,590
mention it and then we started to like
get into it

5942
01:38:01,590 --> 01:38:01,600

the length of the longer fighter and

5946
01:38:05,430 --> 01:38:05,440
the length of the longer fighter and
 

5947
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:07,990
the length of the longer fighter and
uh things like that and we we kind of

5948
01:38:07,990 --> 01:38:08,000
uh things like that and we we kind of
 

5949
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:08,470
uh things like that and we we kind of
which

5950
01:38:08,470 --> 01:38:08,480
which
 

5951
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:10,870
which
when some people train mma they say okay

5952
01:38:10,870 --> 01:38:10,880
when some people train mma they say okay

this guy's a really good wrestler

5954
01:38:12,709 --> 01:38:12,719
this guy's a really good wrestler
 

5955
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:15,350
this guy's a really good wrestler
let's think about avoiding the wrestling

5956
01:38:15,350 --> 01:38:15,360
let's think about avoiding the wrestling
 

5957
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,270
let's think about avoiding the wrestling
or being a better wrestler and i think

5958
01:38:17,270 --> 01:38:17,280
or being a better wrestler and i think
 

5959
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:18,550
or being a better wrestler and i think
that

5960
01:38:18,550 --> 01:38:18,560
that
 

5961
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:21,109
that
when the difference in skill is so great

5962
01:38:21,109 --> 01:38:21,119
when the difference in skill is so great
 

5963
01:38:21,119 --> 01:38:23,910
when the difference in skill is so great
those are both the wrong answer

5964
01:38:23,910 --> 01:38:23,920
those are both the wrong answer
 

5965
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:25,270
those are both the wrong answer
if a guy who's a really good wrestler

5966
01:38:25,270 --> 01:38:25,280
if a guy who's a really good wrestler
 

5967
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:26,390
if a guy who's a really good wrestler
wants to take you down and you don't

5968
01:38:26,390 --> 01:38:26,400
wants to take you down and you don't
 

5969
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:27,750
wants to take you down and you don't
have a lot of wrestling experience he's

5970
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:27,760
have a lot of wrestling experience he's
 

5971
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:28,870
have a lot of wrestling experience he's
probably going to get you down if he's

5972
01:38:28,870 --> 01:38:28,880
probably going to get you down if he's
 

5973
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:30,229
probably going to get you down if he's
got a good coach

5974
01:38:30,229 --> 01:38:30,239
got a good coach
 

5975
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:32,709
got a good coach
right so you have to deal with that to

5976
01:38:32,709 --> 01:38:32,719
right so you have to deal with that to
 

5977
01:38:32,719 --> 01:38:34,070
right so you have to deal with that to
then say i'm gonna then

5978
01:38:34,070 --> 01:38:34,080
then say i'm gonna then
 

5979
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:35,990
then say i'm gonna then
learn in eight weeks how to wrestle

5980
01:38:35,990 --> 01:38:36,000
learn in eight weeks how to wrestle
 

5981
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,109
learn in eight weeks how to wrestle
better than a guy who's been wrestling

5982
01:38:37,109 --> 01:38:37,119
better than a guy who's been wrestling
 

5983
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:38,629
better than a guy who's been wrestling
since he was eight years old is also a

5984
01:38:38,629 --> 01:38:38,639
since he was eight years old is also a
 

5985
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:39,350
since he was eight years old is also a
bad idea

5986
01:38:39,350 --> 01:38:39,360
bad idea
 

5987
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:41,189
bad idea
so what we concentrated on for that camp

5988
01:38:41,189 --> 01:38:41,199
so what we concentrated on for that camp
 

5989
01:38:41,199 --> 01:38:43,350
so what we concentrated on for that camp
and it worked beautifully was

5990
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:43,360
and it worked beautifully was
 

5991
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:45,910
and it worked beautifully was
not getting caught in chain wrestling

5992
01:38:45,910 --> 01:38:45,920
not getting caught in chain wrestling
 

5993
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,030
not getting caught in chain wrestling
these are the takedowns you're going to

5994
01:38:47,030 --> 01:38:47,040
these are the takedowns you're going to
 

5995
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:48,070
these are the takedowns you're going to
get caught with

5996
01:38:48,070 --> 01:38:48,080
get caught with
 

5997
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:49,830
get caught with
this is how to not get caught with the

5998
01:38:49,830 --> 01:38:49,840
this is how to not get caught with the
 

5999
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:51,669
this is how to not get caught with the
next step while you're defending take

6000
01:38:51,669 --> 01:38:51,679
next step while you're defending take
 

6001
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:52,550
next step while you're defending take
down one

6002
01:38:52,550 --> 01:38:52,560
down one
 

6003
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:54,070
down one
because it's the chain of techniques

6004
01:38:54,070 --> 01:38:54,080
because it's the chain of techniques
 

6005
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:56,070
because it's the chain of techniques
that are going to get you [\h__\h] right

6006
01:38:56,070 --> 01:38:56,080
that are going to get you [\h__\h] right
 

6007
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:58,550
that are going to get you [\h__\h] right

6008
01:38:58,550 --> 01:38:58,560
so we talked we did a ton of work on get
 

6009
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:00,229
so we talked we did a ton of work on get
ups and breaking the hands from

6010
01:39:00,229 --> 01:39:00,239
ups and breaking the hands from
 

6011
01:39:00,239 --> 01:39:01,910
ups and breaking the hands from
the various takedowns like it was a

6012
01:39:01,910 --> 01:39:01,920

defend the first takedown and stay out
 

6021
01:39:09,199 --> 01:39:11,510
defend the first takedown and stay out
of the chain don't get chained into

6022
01:39:11,510 --> 01:39:11,520
of the chain don't get chained into
 

6023
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:12,790

weight yeah like i

6036
01:39:23,990 --> 01:39:24,000

6039
01:39:26,239 --> 01:39:27,270
i can't see him staying at 145 forever
when they start giving him

so

6054
01:39:38,310 --> 01:39:38,320
so
 

6055
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:40,709
so
kyle pressed forward there and he said

6056
01:39:40,709 --> 01:39:40,719
kyle pressed forward there and he said
 

6057
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:42,310
kyle pressed forward there and he said
uh he felt that there was no power left

6058
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:42,320
uh he felt that there was no power left
 

6059
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:44,790
uh he felt that there was no power left
in zabeet's hands and so he felt fine

6072
01:39:58,790 --> 01:39:58,800
he started walking right through him it
 

6073
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,310
he started walking right through him it

of different sporting events that's one

6096
01:40:21,910 --> 01:40:21,920
of different sporting events that's one
 

6097
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:23,590
of different sporting events that's one
of the loudest things i've ever heard

6098
01:40:23,590 --> 01:40:23,600
of the loudest things i've ever heard
 

6099
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:26,070
of the loudest things i've ever heard
when he did that and i was going crazy

6100
01:40:26,070 --> 01:40:26,080
when he did that and i was going crazy
 

6101
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:27,030
when he did that and i was going crazy
and um

6102
01:40:27,030 --> 01:40:27,040
and um
 

6103
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:29,030
and um
you ask about that being like taught or

6104
01:40:29,030 --> 01:40:29,040
you ask about that being like taught or
 

6105
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:31,510
you ask about that being like taught or
not kyle is so much like that

6106
01:40:31,510 --> 01:40:31,520
not kyle is so much like that
 

6107
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:32,950
not kyle is so much like that
that i have to try and tease some of

6108
01:40:32,950 --> 01:40:32,960
that i have to try and tease some of
 

6109
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:34,950
that i have to try and tease some of
that out of him and pull it back

6110
01:40:34,950 --> 01:40:34,960
that out of him and pull it back
 

6111
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:38,470
that out of him and pull it back
because he's also so very technical when

6112
01:40:38,470 --> 01:40:38,480
because he's also so very technical when
 

6113
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:39,750
because he's also so very technical when
he wants to be

6114
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:39,760
he wants to be
 

6115
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:42,470
he wants to be
that the emotion and the fun of it gets

6116
01:40:42,470 --> 01:40:42,480
that the emotion and the fun of it gets
 

6117
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:43,910
that the emotion and the fun of it gets
in the way of his technique

6118
01:40:43,910 --> 01:40:43,920
in the way of his technique
 

6119
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:45,910
in the way of his technique
and and probably has cost them a couple

6120
01:40:45,910 --> 01:40:45,920
and and probably has cost them a couple
 

6121
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:47,990
and and probably has cost them a couple
of a couple of wins and so that's one of

6122
01:40:47,990 --> 01:40:48,000
of a couple of wins and so that's one of
 

6123
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,270
of a couple of wins and so that's one of
the things we work on with him right now

6124
01:40:49,270 --> 01:40:49,280
the things we work on with him right now
 

6125
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,629
the things we work on with him right now
is like staying within yourself

6127
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:53,030
is like staying within yourself
being a professional taking your time to

being a professional taking your time to
 

6129
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:54,870
being a professional taking your time to
download the information in round one

like throwing away some of the strategy

6154
01:41:19,430 --> 01:41:19,440
like throwing away some of the strategy
 

6155
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:20,550
like throwing away some of the strategy
kind of thing

6156
01:41:20,550 --> 01:41:20,560

like you seeing like being not happy
that there could be things that he could

6160
01:41:24,709 --> 01:41:24,719
that there could be things that he could
 

6161
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:25,910
that there could be things that he could
have done to win the fight

have done to win the fight
it's in retrospect i think that at that

6164
01:41:27,830 --> 01:41:27,840
it's in retrospect i think that at that
 

6165
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:29,590
it's in retrospect i think that at that
time we were playing with incredible

6166
01:41:29,590 --> 01:41:29,600
time we were playing with incredible
 

6167
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:30,870
time we were playing with incredible
house money

6168
01:41:30,870 --> 01:41:30,880
house money
 

6169
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:32,629
house money
kyle was a gigantic underdog in that

6170
01:41:32,629 --> 01:41:32,639
kyle was a gigantic underdog in that
 

6171
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:34,550
kyle was a gigantic underdog in that
fight his beat was unstoppable i think

6172
01:41:34,550 --> 01:41:34,560
fight his beat was unstoppable i think
 

6173
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:35,910
fight his beat was unstoppable i think
people were probably picking him to

6174
01:41:35,910 --> 01:41:35,920
people were probably picking him to
 

6175
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:37,109
people were probably picking him to
finish the fight in round one

6176
01:41:37,109 --> 01:41:37,119
finish the fight in round one
 

6177
01:41:37,119 --> 01:41:38,390
finish the fight in round one
i think at that point no one had ever

6178
01:41:38,390 --> 01:41:38,400
i think at that point no one had ever
 

6179
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:40,390
i think at that point no one had ever
gone the distance with the beat yeah and

6180
01:41:40,390 --> 01:41:40,400
gone the distance with the beat yeah and
 

6181
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:41,669
gone the distance with the beat yeah and
no one certainly had

6182
01:41:41,669 --> 01:41:41,679
no one certainly had
 

6183
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:43,270
no one certainly had
you know put that kind of performance

6184
01:41:43,270 --> 01:41:43,280
you know put that kind of performance
 

6185
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:46,149
you know put that kind of performance
together and i think kyle uh kyle put

6186
01:41:46,149 --> 01:41:46,159
together and i think kyle uh kyle put
 

6187
01:41:46,159 --> 01:41:47,350
together and i think kyle uh kyle put
the blueprint out there

6188
01:41:47,350 --> 01:41:47,360
the blueprint out there
 

6189
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:49,830
the blueprint out there
and in retrospect when i look at the

6190
01:41:49,830 --> 01:41:49,840
and in retrospect when i look at the
 

6191
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:51,350
and in retrospect when i look at the
last round

6192
01:41:51,350 --> 01:41:51,360
last round
 

6193
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:52,310
last round
yeah there were things that could have

6194
01:41:52,310 --> 01:41:52,320
yeah there were things that could have
 

6195
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:53,830
yeah there were things that could have
been done differently but we're playing

6196
01:41:53,830 --> 01:41:53,840
been done differently but we're playing
 

6197
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,510
been done differently but we're playing
with house money at that point like i

6198
01:41:55,510 --> 01:41:55,520
with house money at that point like i
 

6199
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:56,149
with house money at that point like i
mean

6200
01:41:56,149 --> 01:41:56,159
mean
 

6201
01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:58,550
mean
let it fly you you get to a point where

6202
01:41:58,550 --> 01:41:58,560
let it fly you you get to a point where
 

6203
01:41:58,560 --> 01:41:59,990
let it fly you you get to a point where
you've got it you're down three rounds

6204
01:41:59,990 --> 01:42:00,000
you've got it you're down three rounds

and there's 20 seconds left you got to

6206

a lot of points
 

6715
01:50:19,199 --> 01:50:21,830
a lot of points
in the fight that it could have uh a

become cheerleaders of someone like
conor mcgregor or donald trump because

01:55:12,629 --> 01:55:12,639
conor mcgregor or donald trump because
 

7005
01:55:12,639 --> 01:55:14,390
conor mcgregor or donald trump because
they see that person exhibiting the

qualities that they themselves lack
and so they become cheerleaders for that

7010
01:55:18,149 --> 01:55:18,159
and so they become cheerleaders for that

i think there'll always be war
especially in underdeveloped parts of

7906
02:10:29,910 --> 02:10:29,920
especially in underdeveloped parts of
 

7907
02:10:29,920 --> 02:10:31,189
especially in underdeveloped parts of
the world

7908
02:10:31,189 --> 02:10:31,199
the world
 

7909
02:10:31,199 --> 02:10:33,270
the world
um isn't there always underdeveloped

7910
02:10:33,270 --> 02:10:33,280
um isn't there always underdeveloped
 

7911
02:10:33,280 --> 02:10:35,350
um isn't there always underdeveloped
relatively parts of the world

7912
02:10:35,350 --> 02:10:35,360
relatively parts of the world
 

7913
02:10:35,360 --> 02:10:36,950
relatively parts of the world
yeah i mean at some point though you'd

7914
02:10:36,950 --> 02:10:36,960
yeah i mean at some point though you'd
 

7915
02:10:36,960 --> 02:10:38,470
yeah i mean at some point though you'd
think i mean the way that

7916
02:10:38,470 --> 02:10:38,480
think i mean the way that
 

7917
02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:40,709
think i mean the way that
you know uh technology is expanding and

7918
02:10:40,709 --> 02:10:40,719
you know uh technology is expanding and
 

7919
02:10:40,719 --> 02:10:41,990
you know uh technology is expanding and
we're bringing technology

7920
02:10:41,990 --> 02:10:42,000
we're bringing technology
 

7921
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:43,589
we're bringing technology
to weird parts of the world that you

7922
02:10:43,589 --> 02:10:43,599
to weird parts of the world that you
 

7923
02:10:43,599 --> 02:10:45,030
to weird parts of the world that you
wouldn't

7924
02:10:45,030 --> 02:10:45,040
wouldn't
 

7925
02:10:45,040 --> 02:10:47,830
wouldn't
uh think of as technologically advanced

7926
02:10:47,830 --> 02:10:47,840
uh think of as technologically advanced
 

7927
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:49,189
uh think of as technologically advanced
the way that uh

7928
02:10:49,189 --> 02:10:49,199
the way that uh
 

7929
02:10:49,199 --> 02:10:51,430
the way that uh
the chinese are inhabiting certain areas

7930
02:10:51,430 --> 02:10:51,440
the chinese are inhabiting certain areas
 

7931
02:10:51,440 --> 02:10:54,310
the chinese are inhabiting certain areas
for mining purposes and things like that

7932
02:10:54,310 --> 02:10:54,320
for mining purposes and things like that
 

7933
02:10:54,320 --> 02:10:56,950
for mining purposes and things like that
i think underdeveloped parts of the

7934
02:10:56,950 --> 02:10:56,960
i think underdeveloped parts of the
 

7935
02:10:56,960 --> 02:10:59,430
i think underdeveloped parts of the
world will get developed quickly

7936
02:10:59,430 --> 02:10:59,440
world will get developed quickly
 

7937
02:10:59,440 --> 02:11:01,189
world will get developed quickly
i just wonder like what the nature of

7938
02:11:01,189 --> 02:11:01,199
i just wonder like what the nature of
 

7939
02:11:01,199 --> 02:11:02,950
i just wonder like what the nature of
that war might be it could be cyber

7940
02:11:02,950 --> 02:11:02,960
that war might be it could be cyber
 

7941
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:04,310
that war might be it could be cyber
it could be all those kinds of things i

7942
02:11:04,310 --> 02:11:04,320
it could be all those kinds of things i
 

7943
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:05,750
it could be all those kinds of things i
think in developed nations it's going to

7944
02:11:05,750 --> 02:11:05,760
think in developed nations it's going to
 

7945
02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:07,109
think in developed nations it's going to
be cyber i think that's probably the

7946
02:11:07,109 --> 02:11:07,119
be cyber i think that's probably the
 

7947
02:11:07,119 --> 02:11:08,149
be cyber i think that's probably the
next phase of war

7948
02:11:08,149 --> 02:11:08,159
next phase of war
 

7949
02:11:08,159 --> 02:11:09,589
next phase of war
but i mean i think you talk about parts

7950
02:11:09,589 --> 02:11:09,599
but i mean i think you talk about parts
 

7951
02:11:09,599 --> 02:11:10,790
but i mean i think you talk about parts
of the world like the middle east and

7952
02:11:10,790 --> 02:11:10,800
of the world like the middle east and
 

7953
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:11,830
of the world like the middle east and
it's just still going to be

7954
02:11:11,830 --> 02:11:11,840
it's just still going to be
 

7955
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:14,229
it's just still going to be
warring tribal factions we can't even

7956
02:11:14,229 --> 02:11:14,239
warring tribal factions we can't even
 

7957
02:11:14,239 --> 02:11:15,910
warring tribal factions we can't even
begin to understand what those

7958
02:11:15,910 --> 02:11:15,920
begin to understand what those
 

7959
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:18,069
begin to understand what those
people are fighting about over there yet

7960

people are fighting about over there yet
yet everyone sitting in america on their

7962
02:11:19,750 --> 02:11:19,760
yet everyone sitting in america on their
 

7963
02:11:19,760 --> 02:11:21,189
yet everyone sitting in america on their
couch has an opinion

7964
02:11:21,189 --> 02:11:21,199
couch has an opinion
 

7965
02:11:21,199 --> 02:11:24,069
couch has an opinion
like you can't even begin to understand

7966
02:11:24,069 --> 02:11:24,079
like you can't even begin to understand
 

7967

when when what's violated is much deeper
than just kind of um

7976
02:11:33,030 --> 02:11:33,040
than just kind of um
 

7977
02:11:33,040 --> 02:11:36,390
than just kind of um

8192
02:15:21,910 --> 02:15:21,920
so all the things you're describing is
 

8193
02:15:21,920 --> 02:15:24,149
so all the things you're describing is
what we had as you mentioned before when

8194
02:15:24,149 --> 02:15:24,159
what we had as you mentioned before when
 

8195
02:15:24,159 --> 02:15:25,510
what we had as you mentioned before when
you were like a teenager

8196
02:15:25,510 --> 02:15:25,520
you were like a teenager
 

8197
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:27,030
you were like a teenager
yeah so the state of the world but

8198
02:15:27,030 --> 02:15:27,040
yeah so the state of the world but
 

8199
02:15:27,040 --> 02:15:29,109
yeah so the state of the world but
that's because your mind was formed then

8200
02:15:29,109 --> 02:15:29,119
that's because your mind was formed then
 

8201
02:15:29,119 --> 02:15:31,669
that's because your mind was formed then
it very well could be it very well could

8202
02:15:31,669 --> 02:15:31,679
it very well could be it very well could
 

8203
02:15:31,679 --> 02:15:33,350
it very well could be it very well could
be it's very possible that the virtual

8204
02:15:33,350 --> 02:15:33,360
be it's very possible that the virtual
 

8205
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:35,030
be it's very possible that the virtual
reality worlds that we'll create

8206
02:15:35,030 --> 02:15:35,040
reality worlds that we'll create
 

8207
02:15:35,040 --> 02:15:37,109
reality worlds that we'll create
will be actually a much higher level of

8208
02:15:37,109 --> 02:15:37,119
will be actually a much higher level of
 

8209
02:15:37,119 --> 02:15:38,390
will be actually a much higher level of
existence in fact like

8210
02:15:38,390 --> 02:15:38,400
existence in fact like
 

8211
02:15:38,400 --> 02:15:41,430
existence in fact like
now we're getting we're moving slowly

8212
02:15:41,430 --> 02:15:41,440
now we're getting we're moving slowly
 

8213
02:15:41,440 --> 02:15:42,229
now we're getting we're moving slowly
away from

8214
02:15:42,229 --> 02:15:42,239
away from
 

8215
02:15:42,239 --> 02:15:44,709
away from
tribalism perhaps you could argue the

8216
02:15:44,709 --> 02:15:44,719
tribalism perhaps you could argue the
 

8217
02:15:44,719 --> 02:15:46,149
tribalism perhaps you could argue the
ideas of nations

8218
02:15:46,149 --> 02:15:46,159
ideas of nations
 

8219
02:15:46,159 --> 02:15:47,990
ideas of nations
and we're going we're moving into the

8220
02:15:47,990 --> 02:15:48,000
and we're going we're moving into the
 

8221
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:49,669
and we're going we're moving into the
realm of ideas

8222
02:15:49,669 --> 02:15:49,679
realm of ideas
 

8223
02:15:49,679 --> 02:15:51,030
realm of ideas
and it could be a higher form of

8224
02:15:51,030 --> 02:15:51,040
and it could be a higher form of
 

8225
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:53,350
and it could be a higher form of
existence where we're sort of

8226
02:15:53,350 --> 02:15:53,360
existence where we're sort of
 

8227
02:15:53,360 --> 02:15:56,310
existence where we're sort of
uh moving past the constraints of our

8228
02:15:56,310 --> 02:15:56,320
uh moving past the constraints of our
 

8229
02:15:56,320 --> 02:15:57,830
uh moving past the constraints of our
meat vehicles

8230
02:15:57,830 --> 02:15:57,840
meat vehicles
 

8231
02:15:57,840 --> 02:15:59,910
meat vehicles
into the space of our minds it depends

8232
02:15:59,910 --> 02:15:59,920

somewhat congruent in your path
 

8755
02:24:09,359 --> 02:24:11,030
somewhat congruent in your path
you're just utilizing social media but i

02:24:18,230 --> 02:24:18,240
and now they're doing something totally
 

8763
02:24:18,240 --> 02:24:21,429
and now they're doing something totally
foreign to them and they're only

foreign to them and they're only
 

8765
02:24:21,439 --> 02:24:23,110
foreign to them and they're only
able to do it maybe because of social

8955
02:27:14,800 --> 02:27:16,309
success is and they're kind of
struggling to do that and they're just

8956
02:27:16,309 --> 02:27:16,319
struggling to do that and they're just
 

8957
02:27:16,319 --> 02:27:18,230
struggling to do that and they're just
awkward at it at first

8958
02:27:18,230 --> 02:27:18,240
awkward at it at first
 

8959
02:27:18,240 --> 02:27:19,910
awkward at it at first
and like it's easy to focus on the

8960
02:27:19,910 --> 02:27:19,920
and like it's easy to focus on the
 

8961
02:27:19,920 --> 02:27:21,910
and like it's easy to focus on the
awkwardness and the

8962
02:27:21,910 --> 02:27:21,920
awkwardness and the
 

8963
02:27:21,920 --> 02:27:23,830
awkwardness and the
the stumbling around us people have that

8964
02:27:23,830 --> 02:27:23,840
the stumbling around us people have that
 

8965
02:27:23,840 --> 02:27:25,030
the stumbling around us people have that
and they start [\h__\h] on each other

8966
02:27:25,030 --> 02:27:25,040
and they start [\h__\h] on each other
 

8967
02:27:25,040 --> 02:27:25,349
and they start [\h__\h] on each other
like

8968
02:27:25,349 --> 02:27:25,359
like
 

8969
02:27:25,359 --> 02:27:27,190
like
it's easy to kind of focus in on that

8970
02:27:27,190 --> 02:27:27,200
it's easy to kind of focus in on that
 

8971
02:27:27,200 --> 02:27:28,550
it's easy to kind of focus in on that
but i think that's just like

8972
02:27:28,550 --> 02:27:28,560
but i think that's just like
 

8973
02:27:28,560 --> 02:27:31,030
but i think that's just like
people you know white belts there's more

8974
02:27:31,030 --> 02:27:31,040
people you know white belts there's more
 

8975

people you know white belts there's more
white belts in the world than there are

8976
02:27:32,230 --> 02:27:32,240
white belts in the world than there are
 

8977
02:27:32,240 --> 02:27:33,510
white belts in the world than there are
black belts but you gotta give them a

8978
02:27:33,510 --> 02:27:33,520
black belts but you gotta give them a
 

8979
02:27:33,520 --> 02:27:34,790
black belts but you gotta give them a
chance to kind of grow

8980
02:27:34,790 --> 02:27:34,800
chance to kind of grow
 

8981
02:27:34,800 --> 02:27:36,469
chance to kind of grow
i think on social media if you put your
