00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:35,890
engineering scale you started as a
 

179
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,060
engineering scale you started as a
programmer with C by building yeah so

scale you have to do some unfortunately

188
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:47,950
scale you have to do some unfortunately
 

189
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,910
scale you have to do some unfortunately
legit large-scale engineering so how do

190
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:50,920
legit large-scale engineering so how do
 

191
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,370
legit large-scale engineering so how do
you make that magic happen hire people

192
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:53,380
you make that magic happen hire people
 

193
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,809
you make that magic happen hire people
that I can learn from number one I mean

I'm a hacker in the sense that I you

196
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:00,190
I'm a hacker in the sense that I you
 

197
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,710
I'm a hacker in the sense that I you
know my approach has always been do

00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:01,720
know my approach has always been do
 

199
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,800
know my approach has always been do
whatever it takes to make it work so

200
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:04,810
whatever it takes to make it work so
 

201
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,770
whatever it takes to make it work so
that I can see and feel the thing and

202
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:07,780
that I can see and feel the thing and
 

203
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,680
that I can see and feel the thing and
then learn what needs to come next and

204
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:09,690
then learn what needs to come next and
 

205
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,569
then learn what needs to come next and
oftentimes what needs to come next is a

people which is scale and there's a lot

210
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:19,989
people which is scale and there's a lot
 

211
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:22,469
people which is scale and there's a lot
of great people out there that either

00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
of great people out there that either
 

213
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,440
of great people out there that either
have experience or are extremely fast

that we've been lucky enough to find and
 

219
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:34,879
that we've been lucky enough to find and
with for four years but I think a lot of

00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:34,889
with for four years but I think a lot of
 

221
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:38,449
with for four years but I think a lot of
it we benefit a ton from the open source

222
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:38,459
it we benefit a ton from the open source
 

223
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:40,579
it we benefit a ton from the open source
community and just all the learnings

224
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:40,589
community and just all the learnings
 

225
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:44,239
community and just all the learnings
there that are laid bare in the open all

226
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:44,249
there that are laid bare in the open all
 

227
00:04:44,249 --> 00:04:46,989
there that are laid bare in the open all
the mistakes all the success all the

the mistakes all the success all the
 

229
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:51,559
the mistakes all the success all the
problems it's a very slow-moving process

230
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:51,569
problems it's a very slow-moving process
 

231
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:53,719
problems it's a very slow-moving process
usually open source but it's very

232
00:04:53,719 --> 00:04:53,729
usually open source but it's very
 

233
00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:56,359
usually open source but it's very
deliberate and you get to see because of

234
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:56,369
deliberate and you get to see because of
 

235
00:04:56,369 --> 00:04:59,899
deliberate and you get to see because of
the the pace you get to see what it

236
00:04:59,899 --> 00:04:59,909
the the pace you get to see what it
 

237
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:01,329
the the pace you get to see what it
takes to really build something

238
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:01,339
takes to really build something
 

239
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:04,399
takes to really build something
meaningful so I learned most most of

240
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:04,409
meaningful so I learned most most of
 

241
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:06,769
meaningful so I learned most most of
everything I learned about hacking and

242
00:05:06,769 --> 00:05:06,779
everything I learned about hacking and
 

243
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:09,290
everything I learned about hacking and
programming and engineering has been due

244
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:09,300
programming and engineering has been due
 

245
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,419
programming and engineering has been due
to open source and and the the

246
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:14,429
to open source and and the the
 

247
00:05:14,429 --> 00:05:19,850
to open source and and the the
generosity that people have given to

248
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:19,860
generosity that people have given to
 

249
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,529
generosity that people have given to
give up their time sacrificer time

250
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:21,539
give up their time sacrificer time
 

251
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:24,589
give up their time sacrificer time
without any expectation in return other

without any expectation in return other
than being a part of something much

254
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:27,479
than being a part of something much
 

255
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,419
than being a part of something much
larger than themselves yeah just great

256
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:29,429
larger than themselves yeah just great
 

257
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:32,419
larger than themselves yeah just great
open-source movement is amazing but if

258
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:32,429
open-source movement is amazing but if
 

259
00:05:32,429 --> 00:05:34,100
open-source movement is amazing but if
you just look at the scale like Square

260
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:34,110
you just look at the scale like Square
 

261
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,989
you just look at the scale like Square
has to take care of is this a

262
00:05:35,989 --> 00:05:35,999
has to take care of is this a
 

263
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:38,779
has to take care of is this a
fundamentally a software problem or

264
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:38,789
fundamentally a software problem or
 

265
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:40,669
fundamentally a software problem or
hardware problem you mentioned hiring a

266
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:40,679
hardware problem you mentioned hiring a
 

267
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:44,929
hardware problem you mentioned hiring a
bunch of people but said it's not maybe

268
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:44,939
bunch of people but said it's not maybe
 

269
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:46,549
bunch of people but said it's not maybe
from our perspective not often talked

270
00:05:46,549 --> 00:05:46,559
from our perspective not often talked
 

271
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:49,339
from our perspective not often talked
about how incredible that is to sort of

272
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:49,349
about how incredible that is to sort of
 

273
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,529
about how incredible that is to sort of
have a system that doesn't go down often

274
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:51,539
have a system that doesn't go down often
 

275
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:54,679
have a system that doesn't go down often
that secure is able to take care of all

276
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:54,689
that secure is able to take care of all
 

277
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:57,019
that secure is able to take care of all
these transactions like maybe I'm I'm

278
00:05:57,019 --> 00:05:57,029
these transactions like maybe I'm I'm
 

279
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:59,239
these transactions like maybe I'm I'm
also a hacker at heart and it's

280
00:05:59,239 --> 00:05:59,249
also a hacker at heart and it's
 

281
00:05:59,249 --> 00:06:01,009
also a hacker at heart and it's
incredible to me that that kind of scale

282
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:01,019
incredible to me that that kind of scale
 

283
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:04,069
incredible to me that that kind of scale
could be achieved is there some insight

284
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:04,079
could be achieved is there some insight
 

285
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,059
could be achieved is there some insight
some lessons some interesting tidbits

286
00:06:08,059 --> 00:06:08,069
some lessons some interesting tidbits
 

287
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:10,730
some lessons some interesting tidbits
that you can say about how to make that

288
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:10,740
that you can say about how to make that
 

289
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,980
that you can say about how to make that
scale happen is it the hardware

290
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:12,990
scale happen is it the hardware
 

291
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,109
scale happen is it the hardware
fundamentally challenge is it a software

292
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:15,119
fundamentally challenge is it a software
 

293
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:21,559
fundamentally challenge is it a software
challenge is it like is it a social

294
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:21,569
challenge is it like is it a social
 

295
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:23,869
challenge is it like is it a social
challenge of building large teams of

296
00:06:23,869 --> 00:06:23,879
challenge of building large teams of
 

297
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,309
challenge of building large teams of
engineers that work together that kind

298
00:06:25,309 --> 00:06:25,319
engineers that work together that kind
 

299
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,689
engineers that work together that kind
of thing that quotes is there what's the

300
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:26,699
of thing that quotes is there what's the
 

301
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:28,879
of thing that quotes is there what's the
interesting challenges there by the way

302
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:28,889
interesting challenges there by the way
 

303
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,499
interesting challenges there by the way
you're the best Russ hacker I've ever

304
00:06:30,499 --> 00:06:30,509
you're the best Russ hacker I've ever
 

305
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:34,429
you're the best Russ hacker I've ever
met I think thank you both if the

306
00:06:34,429 --> 00:06:34,439
met I think thank you both if the
 

307
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:36,109
met I think thank you both if the
enumeration you just went through I

308
00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:36,119
enumeration you just went through I
 

309
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:38,749
enumeration you just went through I
don't think there's one you have to kind

310
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:38,759
don't think there's one you have to kind
 

311
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,299
don't think there's one you have to kind
of focus on all and the ability to focus

312
00:06:41,299 --> 00:06:41,309
of focus on all and the ability to focus
 

313
00:06:41,309 --> 00:06:45,930
of focus on all and the ability to focus
on all that really comes down to how you

314
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:45,940
on all that really comes down to how you
 

315
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,200
on all that really comes down to how you
these problems and whether you can break

316
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,210
these problems and whether you can break
 

317
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,220
these problems and whether you can break
them down into parts that you can focus

318
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:53,230
them down into parts that you can focus
 

319
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,870
them down into parts that you can focus
on because I think the biggest mistake

320
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
on because I think the biggest mistake
 

321
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,090
on because I think the biggest mistake
is trying to solve or address too many

322
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:00,100
is trying to solve or address too many
 

323
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:04,290
is trying to solve or address too many
at once or not going deep enough with

00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:04,300
at once or not going deep enough with

00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,620
at once or not going deep enough with
the questions or not being critical of

the questions or not being critical of
 

327
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,500
the questions or not being critical of
the answers you find or not form not

00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:10,510
the answers you find or not form not
 

329
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:14,190
the answers you find or not form not
taking the time to form credible

330
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:14,200
taking the time to form credible
 

331
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,740
taking the time to form credible
hypotheses that you can actually test

332
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:16,750
hypotheses that you can actually test
 

333
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,910
hypotheses that you can actually test
and you can see the result of so all of

334
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:20,920
and you can see the result of so all of
 

335
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,920
and you can see the result of so all of
those fall in the face of ultimately

00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:24,930
those fall in the face of ultimately

00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:26,980
critical thinking skills problem-solving
 

339
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,880
critical thinking skills problem-solving
skills and if there's one skill I want

340
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:29,890
skills and if there's one skill I want
 

341
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,350
skills and if there's one skill I want
to improve every day it's that that's

342
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
to improve every day it's that that's
 

343
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,210
to improve every day it's that that's
that's what contributes to learning and

344
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:35,220
that's what contributes to learning and
 

345
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,130
that's what contributes to learning and
the only way we can evolve any of these

346
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:38,140
the only way we can evolve any of these
 

347
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,620
the only way we can evolve any of these
things is learning what is currently

00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,000
one of the things we found is that we
 

423
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,790
one of the things we found is that we
weren't expecting this at all when we

424
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:23,800
weren't expecting this at all when we
 

425
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,350
weren't expecting this at all when we
started we thought were just building a

426
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,360
started we thought were just building a
 

427
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,160
started we thought were just building a
a piece of hardware to enable people to

00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,480
a piece of hardware to enable people to
plug it into their phone and swipe

plug it into their phone and swipe
 

431
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:33,450
plug it into their phone and swipe
credit card and then as we talked with

432
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:33,460
credit card and then as we talked with
 

433
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,150
credit card and then as we talked with
people who actually tried to accept

434
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,160
people who actually tried to accept
 

435
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,040
people who actually tried to accept
credit cards in the past we found a

436
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,050
credit cards in the past we found a
 

437
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,410
credit cards in the past we found a
consistent theme which many of them

438
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:40,420
consistent theme which many of them
 

439
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,190
consistent theme which many of them
weren't even enabled and enabled but

440
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:44,200
weren't even enabled and enabled but
 

441
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,040
weren't even enabled and enabled but
allowed to process credit cards and we

442
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,050
allowed to process credit cards and we
 

443
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,320
allowed to process credit cards and we
dug a little bit deeper again asking

444
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:49,330
dug a little bit deeper again asking
 

445
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,830
dug a little bit deeper again asking
that question and we found that a lot of

446
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:52,840
that question and we found that a lot of
 

447
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,410
that question and we found that a lot of
them would go to banks or these

448
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:55,420
them would go to banks or these
 

449

taking a lot of personal risk financial
 

465
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:23,910
taking a lot of personal risk financial
risk and it just felt ridiculous to us

466
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:23,920
risk and it just felt ridiculous to us

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:33,610
you had to get your credit checked and
 

473
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,630
you had to get your credit checked and
as we dug deeper we realized that that

00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:36,640
as we dug deeper we realized that that
 

475
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,190
as we dug deeper we realized that that

behavior so that's the first thing we
 

485
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,390

actually looked at and that's where the

actually looked at and that's where the

00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,860
actually looked at and that's where the
you know we built the hardware but the

00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:52,870
you know we built the hardware but the
 

489
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:56,070
you know we built the hardware but the

the path that eventually leads to AI we
started with a very strong data science

started with a very strong data science
 

497

about making hardware it was more about

about making hardware it was more about

there is so to enable more people to

there is so to enable more people to

00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,740
there is so to enable more people to
come into the system you have to lower

00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:24,750
come into the system you have to lower

the barrier of checking that that person
 

513
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,860
the barrier of checking that that person

into seeing that people are
 

591
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,890
into seeing that people are
fundamentally good and then you just

I mean we weren't calling it machine

610
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,110
I mean we weren't calling it machine
 

611
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,290
I mean we weren't calling it machine
learning but it was data science and

learning but it was data science and
 

613
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,870
learning but it was data science and
then as the industry evolved machine

614
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:47,880
then as the industry evolved machine
 

615
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,850
then as the industry evolved machine
learning became more of the nomenclature

616

learning became more of the nomenclature
 

617
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:54,260
learning became more of the nomenclature
and and as that evolved it became more

618

and and as that evolved it became more
 

619
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,630
and and as that evolved it became more
sophisticated with deep learning and as

sophisticated with deep learning and as
 

621
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,000

00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,670
we have to we had to partner with a bank
we had to partner with Visa MasterCard

634
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:13,680
we had to partner with Visa MasterCard
 

635
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,390
we had to partner with Visa MasterCard
and we had to show that by bringing more

636
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:17,400
and we had to show that by bringing more
 

637
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,730
and we had to show that by bringing more
people into the system that we could do

people into the system that we could do

had a bucket of you know five hundred
 

655
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,530
had a bucket of you know five hundred
people using it and then we showed

people using it and then we showed
 

657
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,390
people using it and then we showed
results in a thousand and then ten

about it and that put a lot of pressure
 

671
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:03,590
about it and that put a lot of pressure
on us to do the right things and it also

so I think you know the the internet

750
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:52,720
so I think you know the the internet
 

751
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,430
so I think you know the the internet
continuing to be accessible to people is

752
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:55,440
continuing to be accessible to people is
 

753
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,890
continuing to be accessible to people is
number one and then I think currency is

754
00:16:58,890 --> 00:16:58,900
number one and then I think currency is
 

755
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:03,420
number one and then I think currency is
is number two and it will just allow for

756
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:03,430
is number two and it will just allow for
 

757
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,390
is number two and it will just allow for
a lot more innovation a lot more speed

758
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:05,400
a lot more innovation a lot more speed
 

759
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,069
a lot more innovation a lot more speed

761
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,160
in terms of what we can build and others
can build and it's just it's just really

762
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:11,170
can build and it's just it's just really
 

763
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:11,640
can build and it's just it's just really

00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:57,580
farah world for the way we we think
 

801
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,540
farah world for the way we we think
about money I I think the most beautiful

802
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:00,550
about money I I think the most beautiful
 

803
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,910
about money I I think the most beautiful
thing about it is there's no one person

804
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:02,920
thing about it is there's no one person
 

805
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,420
thing about it is there's no one person
setting the direction and there's no one

806
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:06,430
setting the direction and there's no one
 

807
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,220
setting the direction and there's no one
person on the other side that can stop

808
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:08,230
person on the other side that can stop
 

809
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:13,350
person on the other side that can stop
it so we have something that is pretty

810
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:13,360
it so we have something that is pretty
 

811
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,680
it so we have something that is pretty
organic in nature and very principled in

812
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:16,690
organic in nature and very principled in
 

813
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:21,150
organic in nature and very principled in
its original design and I you know I

814
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:21,160
its original design and I you know I
 

815
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,650
its original design and I you know I
think the Bitcoin white paper is one of

816
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:22,660
think the Bitcoin white paper is one of
 

817
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,270
think the Bitcoin white paper is one of
the most seminal works of computer

818
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:24,280
the most seminal works of computer
 

819
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,650
the most seminal works of computer
science in the last 20 30 years it's

820
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:28,660
science in the last 20 30 years it's
 

821
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,840
science in the last 20 30 years it's
it's poetry I mean it's a really cool

822
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:30,850
it's poetry I mean it's a really cool
 

823
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,730
it's poetry I mean it's a really cool
technology I mean that's not often

824
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:32,740
technology I mean that's not often
 

825
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,860
technology I mean that's not often
talked about sort of there's so much

826
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:34,870
talked about sort of there's so much
 

827
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,810
talked about sort of there's so much
sort of hype around digital currency

828
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:36,820
sort of hype around digital currency
 

829
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,700
sort of hype around digital currency
about the financial impacts of it but

830
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:38,710
about the financial impacts of it but
 

831
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,170
about the financial impacts of it but
the actual technology is quite beautiful

832
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:40,180
the actual technology is quite beautiful
 

833
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,270
the actual technology is quite beautiful
from a computer science perspective yeah

834
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:42,280
from a computer science perspective yeah
 

835
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,250
from a computer science perspective yeah
and the underlying principles behind it

836
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:44,260
and the underlying principles behind it
 

837
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,020
and the underlying principles behind it
that went into it even to the point of

838
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,030
that went into it even to the point of
 

839
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:49,110
that went into it even to the point of
releasing it under a pseudonym I think

840
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,120
releasing it under a pseudonym I think
 

841
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,880
releasing it under a pseudonym I think
that's a very very powerful statement

842
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:50,890
that's a very very powerful statement
 

843
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,040
that's a very very powerful statement
the timing of when it was released is

844
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,050
the timing of when it was released is
 

845
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:57,360
the timing of when it was released is
powerful it was it was a total activist

846
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:57,370
powerful it was it was a total activist
 

847
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,090
powerful it was it was a total activist
move I mean it's it's moving the world

848
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:00,100
move I mean it's it's moving the world
 

849
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,830
move I mean it's it's moving the world
forward and in a way that I think is

850
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:03,840
forward and in a way that I think is
 

851
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,250
forward and in a way that I think is
extremely noble and honorable and

852
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:07,260
extremely noble and honorable and
 

853
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,890
extremely noble and honorable and
enables everyone to be part of the story

854
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:09,900
enables everyone to be part of the story
 

855
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,950
enables everyone to be part of the story
which is also really cool so you ask the

856
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:13,960
which is also really cool so you ask the
 

857
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,660
which is also really cool so you ask the
question around 10 years in 20 years I

858
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:15,670
question around 10 years in 20 years I
 

859
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,640
question around 10 years in 20 years I
mean I think the amazing thing is no one

860
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:17,650
mean I think the amazing thing is no one
 

861
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:21,810
mean I think the amazing thing is no one
knows and it can emerge and every person

862
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:21,820
knows and it can emerge and every person
 

863
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,090
knows and it can emerge and every person
that comes into the ecosystem whether

864
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:24,100
that comes into the ecosystem whether
 

865
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,780
that comes into the ecosystem whether
they be a developer or someone who uses

866
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:27,790
they be a developer or someone who uses
 

867
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:31,740
they be a developer or someone who uses
it can change its direction in small and

868
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:31,750
it can change its direction in small and
 

869
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,740
it can change its direction in small and
large ways and that's what I think it

870
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:34,750
large ways and that's what I think it
 

871
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,090
large ways and that's what I think it
should because that's what the the

872
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:36,100
should because that's what the the
 

873
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,160
should because that's what the the
Internet has shown is possible now

874
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,170
Internet has shown is possible now
 

875
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,930
Internet has shown is possible now
there's complications with that of

876
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:39,940
there's complications with that of
 

877
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,690
there's complications with that of
course and there's you know certainly

878
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:42,700
course and there's you know certainly
 

879
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,640
course and there's you know certainly
companies that own large ports so the

880
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:44,650
companies that own large ports so the
 

881
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,840
companies that own large ports so the
you know net and conducted more than

882
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:45,850
you know net and conducted more than
 

883
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:50,010
you know net and conducted more than
others and there's not equal access to

884
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:50,020
others and there's not equal access to
 

885
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,720
others and there's not equal access to
every single person in the world just

00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:51,730
every single person in the world just
 

887
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,840
every single person in the world just
yet but all those problems are visible

888
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:54,850
yet but all those problems are visible
 

889
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:57,300
yet but all those problems are visible
enough to speak about them and to me

890
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:57,310
enough to speak about them and to me
 

891
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,830
enough to speak about them and to me
that gives confidence that they're

892
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:58,840
that gives confidence that they're
 

893
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,800
that gives confidence that they're
solvable in a relatively short timeframe

894
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:01,810
solvable in a relatively short timeframe
 

895
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:04,470
solvable in a relatively short timeframe
I think the world changes a lot

896
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:04,480
I think the world changes a lot
 

897
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,549
I think the world changes a lot
as we get these satellites projecting

898
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:08,559
as we get these satellites projecting
 

899
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,640
as we get these satellites projecting
the internet down down earth because it

900
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:11,650
the internet down down earth because it
 

901
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,440
the internet down down earth because it
just removes a bunch of the former

902
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:13,450
just removes a bunch of the former
 

903
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:16,560
just removes a bunch of the former
constraints and and really levels the

904
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:16,570
constraints and and really levels the
 

905
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:19,610

playing field but a global currency

906
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:19,620
playing field but a global currency
 

907
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,740
playing field but a global currency
which a native currency for the Internet

908
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:22,750
which a native currency for the Internet
 

909
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,799
which a native currency for the Internet
is a proxy for is a very powerful

910
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:25,809
is a proxy for is a very powerful
 

911
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,440
is a proxy for is a very powerful
concept and I don't think any one person

912
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:28,450
concept and I don't think any one person
 

913
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,820
concept and I don't think any one person
on this planet truly understands the

914
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:29,830
on this planet truly understands the
 

915
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,520
on this planet truly understands the
ramifications of that I think there's a

916
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:32,530
ramifications of that I think there's a
 

917
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,380
ramifications of that I think there's a
lot of positives to it there's some

918
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:34,390
lot of positives to it there's some
 

919
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,240
lot of positives to it there's some
negatives as well but I think it's

920
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:36,250
negatives as well but I think it's
 

921
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,680
negatives as well but I think it's
possible sorry to interrupt do you think

922
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:37,690
possible sorry to interrupt do you think
 

923
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,450
possible sorry to interrupt do you think
it's possible that this kind of digital

924
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:39,460
it's possible that this kind of digital
 

925
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,870
it's possible that this kind of digital
currency would redefine the nature of

926
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:42,880
currency would redefine the nature of
 

927
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,870
currency would redefine the nature of
money so become the main currency of the

928
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:45,880
money so become the main currency of the
 

929
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,450
money so become the main currency of the
world as opposed to being tied to fiat

930
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:48,460
world as opposed to being tied to fiat
 

931
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,549
world as opposed to being tied to fiat
currency of different nations and to

932
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:50,559
currency of different nations and to
 

933
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,100
currency of different nations and to
really push the decentralization of

934
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:53,110
really push the decentralization of
 

935
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:56,430
really push the decentralization of
control of money definitely but I think

936
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:56,440
control of money definitely but I think
 

937
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,799
control of money definitely but I think
the the bigger ramification is how it

938
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:58,809
the the bigger ramification is how it
 

939
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:02,789
the the bigger ramification is how it
affects how society works and I think

940
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:02,799
affects how society works and I think
 

941
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,039
affects how society works and I think
there were there there are many positive

942
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:05,049
there were there there are many positive
 

943
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:07,230
there were there there are many positive
ramifications outside around money

944
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:07,240
ramifications outside around money
 

945
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,360
ramifications outside around money
just outside of just money money money

946
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:09,370
just outside of just money money money
 

947
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,610
just outside of just money money money
is a foundational layer that enables so

948
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:11,620
is a foundational layer that enables so
 

949
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,049
is a foundational layer that enables so
much more I was meeting with an

950
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:13,059
much more I was meeting with an
 

951
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:16,500
much more I was meeting with an
entrepreneur in Ethiopia and payments is

952
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:16,510
entrepreneur in Ethiopia and payments is
 

953
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:19,440
entrepreneur in Ethiopia and payments is
probably the number one problem to solve

954
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:19,450
probably the number one problem to solve
 

955
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,180
probably the number one problem to solve
across a continent

956
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:21,190
across a continent
 

957
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,490
across a continent
both in terms of moving money across

958

Delta so the explained ability part is
 

1179
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:52,909
Delta so the explained ability part is
kind of essential to be able to explain

1180

kind of essential to be able to explain

1183
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,960
using natural language why the decisions
were made that kind of thing yeah I mean

1184
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:56,970
were made that kind of thing yeah I mean
 

1185
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,460
were made that kind of thing yeah I mean
I think that's one of our biggest risk

1186
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:58,470
I think that's one of our biggest risk
 

1187
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,769
I think that's one of our biggest risk
and artificial intelligence going

1188
00:27:00,769 --> 00:27:00,779
and artificial intelligence going
 

1189
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:02,720
and artificial intelligence going
forward is we are building a lot of

1271
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,120
individual and how they find meaning and
where they find meaning do you think we

1272
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,130
where they find meaning do you think we
 

1273
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,519
where they find meaning do you think we
humans can find meaning in technology in

1274
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:37,529
humans can find meaning in technology in
 

1275
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:39,560
humans can find meaning in technology in
this kind of way yeah 100 percent 1

1276
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:39,570
this kind of way yeah 100 percent 1
 

1277
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,690
this kind of way yeah 100 percent 1
percent and I don't necessarily think

1278
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:41,700
percent and I don't necessarily think
 

1279
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:47,240
percent and I don't necessarily think
it's a negative but I you know it's it's

1280
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:47,250
it's a negative but I you know it's it's
 

1281
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:51,950
it's a negative but I you know it's it's
constantly going to evolve so I don't

1282
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:51,960
constantly going to evolve so I don't
 

1283
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,320
constantly going to evolve so I don't
know but I meaning is is something

1284
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:54,330
know but I meaning is is something
 

1285
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:56,840
know but I meaning is is something
that's entirely subjective and

1286
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:56,850
that's entirely subjective and
 

1287
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:58,879
that's entirely subjective and
I I don't think it's going to be a

00:28:58,879 --> 00:28:58,889
I I don't think it's going to be a
 

1289
00:28:58,889 --> 00:29:02,269
I I don't think it's going to be a

1290
00:29:02,269 --> 00:29:02,279

1291
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:07,549

that enables everyone to love it but

1292
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:07,559
that enables everyone to love it but
 

1293
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:10,190
that enables everyone to love it but
maybe but that question really gets that

1294
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:10,200
maybe but that question really gets that
 

1295
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,899
maybe but that question really gets that
the difference between human and machine

1296
00:29:11,899 --> 00:29:11,909
the difference between human and machine

the you had a little bit of an exchange

1298
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:14,700
the you had a little bit of an exchange
 

1299
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,769
the you had a little bit of an exchange
with Elon Musk basically I mean it's a

1300
00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:18,779
with Elon Musk basically I mean it's a
 

1301
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:20,479
with Elon Musk basically I mean it's a
trivial version of that but I think

1302
00:29:20,479 --> 00:29:20,489
trivial version of that but I think
 

1303
00:29:20,489 --> 00:29:22,129
trivial version of that but I think
there's a more fundamental question of

1304
00:29:22,129 --> 00:29:22,139
there's a more fundamental question of
 

1305
00:29:22,139 --> 00:29:24,139
there's a more fundamental question of
is it possible to tell the difference

1306
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:24,149
is it possible to tell the difference
 

1307
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:28,070
is it possible to tell the difference

between a bot and a human and do you
 

1309
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,609
between a bot and a human and do you
think it's if we look into the future 10

1310
00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:31,619
think it's if we look into the future 10
 

1311
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:33,379
think it's if we look into the future 10
20 years out do you think it would be

1312
00:29:33,379 --> 00:29:33,389
20 years out do you think it would be
 

1313
00:29:33,389 --> 00:29:35,539
20 years out do you think it would be
possible or is it even necessary to tell

00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:35,549
possible or is it even necessary to tell
 

1315
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:37,299
possible or is it even necessary to tell

the difference in the digital space
 

1317
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:40,789
the difference in the digital space
between a human and a robot can we have

00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:40,799
between a human and a robot can we have
 

1319
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,950
between a human and a robot can we have
fulfilling relationships with each or do

1320
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:42,960
fulfilling relationships with each or do
 

1321
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,479

we need to tell the difference between

1322
00:29:44,479 --> 00:29:44,489
we need to tell the difference between

to detect you think so so if you look at

00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:16,519
to detect you think so so if you look at

there's a lot of systems that try to

fool machine learning systems and at
 

1349
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,359
fool machine learning systems and at
least for me the hope is that the

1350
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:23,369
least for me the hope is that the
 

1351
00:30:23,369 --> 00:30:26,049

right there at least your sense is that

mean it's it's a race right so the

the self-awareness is being offloaded to
 

1477
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,980
the self-awareness is being offloaded to
other systems and particularly these

other systems and particularly these
these algorithms and his concern is that

these algorithms and his concern is that
 

1481
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:37,460
these algorithms and his concern is that
we lose that self-awareness because the

we lose that self-awareness because the
 

1483
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,960
we lose that self-awareness because the

a journey of learning new ideas of

00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:37,879
a journey of learning new ideas of
 

1531
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:40,310
a journey of learning new ideas of
learning period it can be a great thing

1532
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:40,320
learning period it can be a great thing
 

1533
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,930
learning period it can be a great thing
but do you know you're doing that are

1534
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:41,940
but do you know you're doing that are
 

1535
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,810
but do you know you're doing that are
you aware that you're inviting it to do

1536
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:44,820
you aware that you're inviting it to do
 

1537
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,700
you aware that you're inviting it to do
that to you I think that's that's a

1538
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:46,710
that to you I think that's that's a
 

1539
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:50,300
that to you I think that's that's a
little risky identifies right is that's

1540
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:50,310
little risky identifies right is that's
 

1541
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:53,500
little risky identifies right is that's
perfectly okay but are you aware that

1542
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:53,510
perfectly okay but are you aware that
 

1543
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:56,690
perfectly okay but are you aware that
you have that invitation and it's it's

1544
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:56,700
you have that invitation and it's it's
 

1545
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,839
you have that invitation and it's it's
being acted upon and so that that's your

1546
00:34:59,839 --> 00:34:59,849
being acted upon and so that that's your
 

1547
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:01,970
being acted upon and so that that's your
that's a concern you're kind of

1548
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:01,980
that's a concern you're kind of
 

1549
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,040
that's a concern you're kind of
highlighting that without a lack of

1550
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,050
highlighting that without a lack of
 

1551
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,990
highlighting that without a lack of
awareness you can just be like floating

1552
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:06,000
awareness you can just be like floating
 

1553
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,599
awareness you can just be like floating
at sea so awareness is key in just the

1554
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:08,609
at sea so awareness is key in just the
 

1555
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:10,010
at sea so awareness is key in just the
future these artificial intelligence

data and who can operate on it and are
we able to share the insights from the

1736
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:32,660
we able to share the insights from the
 

1737
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,320
we able to share the insights from the
data so that we can also build

1738
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:34,330
data so that we can also build
 

1739
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,970
data so that we can also build
algorithms that help our needs or help

algorithms that help our needs or help
 

1741
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:40,540
algorithms that help our needs or help
our business or what not so that's where

00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:47,390
and positive part first looking at the
 

1747
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:51,460
and positive part first looking at the
primitives of AI and the tools we use to

1748
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:51,470
primitives of AI and the tools we use to
 

1749
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,960
primitives of AI and the tools we use to
build these services that will

1750
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:52,970
build these services that will
 

1751
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,880
build these services that will
ultimately touch every single aspect of

1752
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:54,890
ultimately touch every single aspect of
 

1753
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:59,620
ultimately touch every single aspect of
the human experience and then how data

1754
00:39:59,620 --> 00:39:59,630
the human experience and then how data
 

1755
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:04,280
the human experience and then how data
where data is owned and how its how its

1756
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:04,290
where data is owned and how its how its
 

1757
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:07,220
where data is owned and how its how its
shared so those those are the answers

1758
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:07,230
shared so those those are the answers
 

1759
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:10,849
shared so those those are the answers
that as a society as a world we need to

1760
00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:10,859
that as a society as a world we need to
 

1761
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:13,190
that as a society as a world we need to
have better answers around which we're

1762
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:13,200
have better answers around which we're
 

1763
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,359
have better answers around which we're
currently not they're just way too

1764
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:14,369
currently not they're just way too

companies but I think he was spot-on

1768
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:20,369
companies but I think he was spot-on
 

1769
00:40:20,369 --> 00:40:22,930
companies but I think he was spot-on
with identifying the problem and

1770
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:22,940
with identifying the problem and
 

1771
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,070
with identifying the problem and
proposing solutions that would actually

1772
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:25,080
proposing solutions that would actually
 

1773
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,070
proposing solutions that would actually
work at least that we'd learn from that

1774
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:28,080
work at least that we'd learn from that
 

1775
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:33,590
work at least that we'd learn from that
you could expand or evolve but I mean

1776
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:33,600
you could expand or evolve but I mean
 

1777
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,130
you could expand or evolve but I mean
it's I think it's ubi is well well past

dollar mark might be might not be the
 

1789
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:51,349
dollar mark might be might not be the
correct one but you should take the

1790
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:51,359
correct one but you should take the
 

1791
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:54,109
correct one but you should take the
stuffs to try to to implement these

1792
00:40:54,109 --> 00:40:54,119
stuffs to try to to implement these
 

1793
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:57,650
stuffs to try to to implement these
solutions and see see what works so I

1794
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:57,660
solutions and see see what works so I
 

1795
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,420
solutions and see see what works so I
think you and I eat some more diets and

00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:48,100
feel the importance of every moment so I
just use as a reminder like I have an

2046
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:48,110
just use as a reminder like I have an
 

2047
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:48,550
just use as a reminder like I have an
hour

2048
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:48,560
hour
 

2049
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,350
hour
is this really what I'm going to spend

2050
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:50,360
is this really what I'm going to spend
 

2051
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,320
is this really what I'm going to spend
the hour doing like I only have so many

2052
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:53,330
the hour doing like I only have so many
 

2053
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:55,630
the hour doing like I only have so many
more sunsets and sunrises to watch like

2054
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:55,640
more sunsets and sunrises to watch like
 

2055
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,420
more sunsets and sunrises to watch like
I'm not going to get up for it I'm not

2056
00:46:58,420 --> 00:46:58,430
I'm not going to get up for it I'm not
 

2057
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:01,390
I'm not going to get up for it I'm not
going to make sure that I that I that I

2058
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:01,400
going to make sure that I that I that I
 

2059
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,770
going to make sure that I that I that I
try to see it so it's it just puts a lot

2060
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:04,780
try to see it so it's it just puts a lot
 

2061
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,540
try to see it so it's it just puts a lot
into perspective and it helps me

2062
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:07,550
into perspective and it helps me
 

2063
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:11,170
into perspective and it helps me
prioritize I think it's I don't I don't

2064
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:11,180
prioritize I think it's I don't I don't
 

2065
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:13,930
prioritize I think it's I don't I don't
see it as something that's like that I

2066
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:13,940
see it as something that's like that I
 

2067
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:16,900
see it as something that's like that I
dread or is dreadful it it's a it's a

2068
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:16,910
dread or is dreadful it it's a it's a
 

2069
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:18,490
dread or is dreadful it it's a it's a
tool that is available to every single

2070
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:18,500
tool that is available to every single
 

2071
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,530
tool that is available to every single
person to use every day because it shows

2072
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:20,540
person to use every day because it shows
 

2073
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,030
person to use every day because it shows
how precious life is and there's

2074
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:22,040
how precious life is and there's
 

2075
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,880
how precious life is and there's
reminders every single day whether it be

2076
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:24,890
reminders every single day whether it be
 

2077
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:27,160
reminders every single day whether it be
your own health or a friend or a

2078
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:27,170
your own health or a friend or a
 

2079
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:28,930
your own health or a friend or a
co-worker or something you see in the

2080
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:28,940
co-worker or something you see in the
 

2081
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:32,200
co-worker or something you see in the
news so it's to me it's just a question

2082
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:32,210
news so it's to me it's just a question
 

2083
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:34,150
news so it's to me it's just a question
of what we do with that daily reminder

2084
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:34,160
of what we do with that daily reminder
 

2085
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,470
of what we do with that daily reminder
and for me it's um am I really focused

2086
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:38,480
and for me it's um am I really focused
 

2087
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,710
and for me it's um am I really focused
on what matters and sometimes that might

2088
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:41,720
on what matters and sometimes that might
 

2089
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,530
on what matters and sometimes that might
be work sometimes that might be

2090
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:43,540
be work sometimes that might be
 

2091
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,910
be work sometimes that might be
friendships or family or relationships

2092
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:45,920
friendships or family or relationships
 

2093
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,850
friendships or family or relationships
or whatnot but that that's it's the

2094
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:48,860
or whatnot but that that's it's the
 

2095
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:51,490
or whatnot but that that's it's the
ultimate clarifier in that sense so on

2096
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:51,500
ultimate clarifier in that sense so on
 

2097
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,890
ultimate clarifier in that sense so on
the question of what matters another

2098
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:53,900
the question of what matters another
 

2099
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:57,460
the question of what matters another
ridiculously big question of once you

2100
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:57,470
ridiculously big question of once you
 

2101
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:58,690
ridiculously big question of once you
try to make sense of it what do you

2102
00:47:58,690 --> 00:47:58,700
try to make sense of it what do you
 

2103
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,700
try to make sense of it what do you
think is the meaning of it all the

2104
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:00,710
think is the meaning of it all the
 

2105
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:01,600
think is the meaning of it all the
meaning of life

2106
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:01,610
meaning of life
 

2107
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:06,550
meaning of life
what gives you purpose happiness meaning

2108
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:06,560
what gives you purpose happiness meaning
 

2109
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:10,000
what gives you purpose happiness meaning
a lot does I mean I mean just being able

2110
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,010
a lot does I mean I mean just being able
 

2111
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:16,420
a lot does I mean I mean just being able
to be aware of the fact that I'm alive

2112
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:16,430
to be aware of the fact that I'm alive
 

2113
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:20,250
to be aware of the fact that I'm alive
is pretty pretty meaningful the

2114
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:20,260
is pretty pretty meaningful the
 

2115
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:22,930
is pretty pretty meaningful the
connections I feel with individuals

2116
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:22,940
connections I feel with individuals
 

2117
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:26,320
connections I feel with individuals
whether they people I just meet or long

2118
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:26,330
whether they people I just meet or long
 

2119
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:29,020
whether they people I just meet or long
lasting friendships or my family is

2120
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:29,030
lasting friendships or my family is
 

2121
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:32,230
lasting friendships or my family is
meaningful seeing people use something

2122
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:32,240
meaningful seeing people use something
 

2123
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,090
meaningful seeing people use something
that I helped build it is really

2124
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:34,100
that I helped build it is really
 

2125
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:39,190
that I helped build it is really
meaningful and powerful to me but but

2126
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:39,200
meaningful and powerful to me but but
 

2127
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,810
meaningful and powerful to me but but
that sense of I mean I think ultimately

2128
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:40,820
that sense of I mean I think ultimately
 

2129
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:43,840
that sense of I mean I think ultimately
comes down in a sense of connection and

2130
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:43,850
comes down in a sense of connection and
 

2131
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:48,190
comes down in a sense of connection and
just feeling like I am bigger I am part

2132
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:48,200
just feeling like I am bigger I am part
 

2133
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,480
just feeling like I am bigger I am part
of something that's bigger than myself

2134
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:49,490
of something that's bigger than myself
 

2135
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:52,570
of something that's bigger than myself
and like I can feel it directly in small

2136
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:52,580
and like I can feel it directly in small
 

2137
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,010
and like I can feel it directly in small
ways or large ways

2138
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:54,020
ways or large ways
 

2139
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:57,160
ways or large ways
however manifest this is probably uh

2140
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:57,170
however manifest this is probably uh
 

2141
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:00,820
however manifest this is probably uh
it's probably a last question do you

2142
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:00,830
it's probably a last question do you
 

2143
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:05,070
it's probably a last question do you
think we're living in a simulation I

2144
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:05,080
think we're living in a simulation I
 

2145
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,330
think we're living in a simulation I
don't know it's a pretty fun one if we

2146
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:07,340
don't know it's a pretty fun one if we
 

2147
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:10,950
don't know it's a pretty fun one if we
are but also crazy and random and

2148
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:10,960
are but also crazy and random and
 

2149
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:17,170
are but also crazy and random and
brought with tons of problems but yeah

2150
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:17,180
brought with tons of problems but yeah
 

2151
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:18,540
brought with tons of problems but yeah
would you have it any other way

2152
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:18,550
would you have it any other way
 

2153
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:23,350
would you have it any other way
yeah I mean I just think it's taken us

2154
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:23,360
yeah I mean I just think it's taken us
 

2155
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,900
yeah I mean I just think it's taken us
way too long to as a planet to realize

2156
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:25,910
way too long to as a planet to realize
 

2157
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:27,520
way too long to as a planet to realize
we're all in this together and we all

2158
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:27,530
we're all in this together and we all
 

2159
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:32,440
we're all in this together and we all
are connected in in in very significant

2160
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:32,450
are connected in in in very significant
 

2161
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:36,780
are connected in in in very significant
ways I think we we hide our connectivity

2162
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:36,790
ways I think we we hide our connectivity
 

2163
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:39,790
ways I think we we hide our connectivity
very well through ego through you know

2164
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:39,800
very well through ego through you know
 

2165
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,980
very well through ego through you know
whatever or whatever it is of the day

2166
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:41,990
whatever or whatever it is of the day
 

2167
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:45,580
whatever or whatever it is of the day
but that is the one thing I would want

2168
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:45,590
but that is the one thing I would want
 

2169
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:49,840
but that is the one thing I would want
to work towards changing and that's how

2170
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:49,850
to work towards changing and that's how
 

2171
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:51,760
to work towards changing and that's how
I would have it another way because if

2172
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:51,770
I would have it another way because if
 

2173
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:53,380
I would have it another way because if
if we can't do that then how we're going

2174
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:53,390
if we can't do that then how we're going
 

2175
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:54,850
if we can't do that then how we're going
to connect to all the other simulations

2176
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:54,860
to connect to all the other simulations
 

2177
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:56,650
to connect to all the other simulations
because that's the next step is like

2178
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:56,660
because that's the next step is like
 

2179
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,570
because that's the next step is like
what's happening in the other simulation

2180
00:49:58,570 --> 00:49:58,580
what's happening in the other simulation
 

2181
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:03,820
what's happening in the other simulation
escaping this one and yeah spanning

2182
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:03,830
escaping this one and yeah spanning
 

2183
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:05,560
escaping this one and yeah spanning
across the multiple simulations and

2184
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:05,570
across the multiple simulations and
 

2185
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:07,720
across the multiple simulations and
sharing it and on the fun I don't think

2186
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:07,730
sharing it and on the fun I don't think
 

2187
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:10,090
sharing it and on the fun I don't think
there's a better way to end it Jack

2188
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:10,100
there's a better way to end it Jack
 

2189
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,410
there's a better way to end it Jack
thank you so much for all the work you

2190
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:11,420
thank you so much for all the work you
 

2191
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:13,240
thank you so much for all the work you
do there's probably other ways that

2192
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:13,250
do there's probably other ways that
 

2193
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:14,530
do there's probably other ways that
we've ended this and other simulations

2194
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:14,540
we've ended this and other simulations
 

2195
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:17,140
we've ended this and other simulations
that may have been better well that's a

2196
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:17,150
that may have been better well that's a
 

2197
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:19,360
